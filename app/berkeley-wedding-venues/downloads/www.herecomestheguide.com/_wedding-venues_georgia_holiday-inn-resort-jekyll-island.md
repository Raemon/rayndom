## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Family-friendly and absolutely dreamy,** this full-service resort occupies a prime spot on the eastern shore of Jekyll Island, which has been long beloved for its unique salt marshes, iconic red cedars, and unspoiled coastal wilderness. 
  * **Let the Atlantic's gentle waves provide the soundtrack** for your toes-in-the-sand ceremony, then follow with a grand affair in the seaside-elegant Beach House Ballroom, or an al fresco celebration on the oceanfront terrace, which can be tented if desired. Micro-weddings and elopements are welcome, too! 
  * **They offer both traditional guest rooms and family-style suites,** many of which boast water views. Spend your days beach-combing, hiking, biking, or visiting one of the islands natural and cultural treasures, like its historic buildings or the Georgia Sea Turtle Center.
