##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Sitting right at the edge of King Harbor, this local favorite exudes coastal charm.** From the stylish, light-flooded event spaces you'll be treated unbeatable views of the water, served alongside delectable menus highlighted by fresh, sustainable fish. Located walking distance from many Redondo Beach hotels and beaches, it's the perfect spot for anything from a casual rehearsal dinner to a formal reception.
  * **Two versatile private dining rooms offer up-close views of the bustling harbor.** The interior of the intimate Captain's Cabin features an abundance of wood in the barrel ceiling and wainscoting, as well as floor-to-ceiling windows and a cozy fireplace that adds a warm glow on cool evenings.
  * **Wraparound windows and a high, peaked ceiling give the Avalon Room an open, airy quality** , so it's easy to transform into whatever style you have in mind. No matter what ambiance you create inside, the picturesque harbor outside creates an unbeatable backdrop—especially when you're treated to a glorious sunset.
