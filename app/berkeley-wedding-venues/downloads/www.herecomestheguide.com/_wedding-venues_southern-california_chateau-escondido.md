## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched on a prime hilltop just above San Diego, this exquisite mansion** is perfectly placed to capture dramatic, sprawling panoramas of the surrounding mountains, meadows, and vineyards. Despite its proximity to the big city, you'll feel like you have the entire valley to yourself.
  * **Bistro lights glow on the winding terraces and verandas,** creating an enchanting atmosphere for mingling with your loved ones as the sun dips below the horizon. You're welcome to select your own vendors to create a truly customized celebration, or opt for one of the venue's long list of preferred partner (and lock in fab discounts!).
  * **A true destination venue, the chateau sleeps 20 in seven luxurious suites,** each styled with plush furnishings, rich wood detailing, and sumptuous linens. You'll treasure the quiet moments with your loved ones, from cooking together in the magnificent chef's kitchen to watching the morning light slowly dissolve the fog that spreads below.
