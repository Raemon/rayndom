## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A working farm estate set just outside quaint Granville,** this pastoral spot features 64 acres of countryside charm, with rolling pastures, a creek, mature shade trees, and a collection of incredibly adorable four-legged residents…seriously, we dare you not to squeal a little at the fluffy Highland cows. 
  * **Every space is yours for the duration of your rental,** so you’re free to structure your celebration exactly as you please, whether that means an entirely outdoor affair, or perhaps a ceremony by the creek, followed by a reception in the rustic-modern event barn. 
  * **The beautifully remodeled farmhouse sleeps nine guests,** can be rented for the weekend (or longer), and features a spacious open floor plan, four bedrooms, and a gracious wraparound deck that overlooks the sprawling grounds.
