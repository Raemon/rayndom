## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **At the heart of Minneapolis’s Warehouse District and just blocks from the river,** you’ll find this gorgeously restored turn-of-the-century office building, retaining all of its vintage charm but boasting all the essential modern amenities needed for the perfect soiree. 
  * **The luxe interior features lightly-toned brick walls** and a ceiling of exposed rafter and ductwork that’s hung with glittering crystal chandeliers. There’s a lovely permanent bar with tile detailing, and one entire wall of windows overlooking the skyline and bustling street below. 
  * **They’ve got an awesome list of trusted local vendors** who not only deliver stellar service, but are familiar with the neighborhood and this unique venue. Plus, it’s within walking distance of several top-notch hotels, making things extra easy for your out-of-town guests.
