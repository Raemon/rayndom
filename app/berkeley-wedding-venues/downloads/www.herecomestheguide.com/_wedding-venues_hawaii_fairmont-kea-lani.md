## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

**5 Reasons the Fairmont Kea Lani will satisfy everyone in your wedding party:**

**1\. Oceanview wedding ceremonies:** Whether you choose the Royal Fountain Terrace or the Pacific Terrace, guests will “ooh” and “aah” over the impressive Pacific Ocean and Maui Beach views at these outdoor wedding sites.  
**2\. Wedding cake tastings** will keep the MOB busy with dessert decisions. The resort’s pastry chefs have a talent for whipping up flourless chocolate cakes with chocolate ganache, traditional white cakes with passion fruit mousse, luscious red velvets, and classic carrot cakes, to name a few.  
**3\. 37 newly renovated villas are available for family or group rentals** , should your extended family decide to linger a little longer. (Just don’t give them your room number!)  
**4\. The Keiki Lani Kid’s Club will keep your flower girls and ring bearers smiling** with sandcastle building, lizard hunting, coconut painting, and tidepool explorations.  
**5\. Wedding couples will find seclusion at the spa,** where they can indulge in signature treatments and therapeutic massages for two.
