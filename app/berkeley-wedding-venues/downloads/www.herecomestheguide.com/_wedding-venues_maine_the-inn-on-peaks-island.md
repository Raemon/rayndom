## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Let a scenic ferry whisk you away to this island gem in Casco Bay,** just a short 15 minutes from the mainland but with a truly worlds-away feel. This charming inn, just steps from the harbor on Peaks Island, is the quintessential Maine destination, where quaint shops and restaurants give way to rocky coastlines, and gulls soar on the sweetly salty ocean breeze.
  * **Al fresco gatherings exude sun-kissed garden party vibes,** with a quaint white gazebo framed by lush greenery and fragrant flowers. Walk down the paved aisle to say “I do” here before hosting a grand tented event on the lawn, or opt to take advantage of the Inn’s charming indoor settings: a breezy covered porch or cozy lounge for cocktail hour, and a reception in the airy, coastal-inspired restaurant.
  * **The all-inclusive packages simplify everything…and are surprisingly affordable.** The Inn’s seven luxury guest suites provide the perfect place to unwind, each boasting jacuzzi tubs, private decks, and skyline views of Portland, while your custom-crafted menu showcases the freshest seafood and locally sourced ingredients around. You can craft a whole weekend of celebrations however you like—there’s room for lobster bakes, harbor walks, and a relaxed brunch sendoff the next day.
