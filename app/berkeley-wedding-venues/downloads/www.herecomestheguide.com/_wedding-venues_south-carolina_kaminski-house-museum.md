## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's a beautiful historic home on a bluff overlooking the Sampit River** , and is one of South Carolina's finest remaining examples of a Georgian-style mansion. 
  * **Exchange vows beneath the sprawling arms of an ancient oak** , followed by a tented lawn celebration, or one among the twinkle-lit trees. 
  * **Your wedding becomes part of the home's history** —and you'll be helping the museum in its effort to preserve this priceless treasure for years to come.
