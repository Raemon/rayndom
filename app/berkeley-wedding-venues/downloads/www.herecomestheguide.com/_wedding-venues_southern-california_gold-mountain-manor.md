## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked among ancient ponderosas and landscaped gardens, this whimsical log mansion** offers a step back into a quieter time. A welcoming wraparound veranda with old-fashioned rocking chairs leads inside, where you'll find vintage treasures thoughtfully displayed alongside plush, cozy furnishings and wood-burning fireplaces.
  * **Exchange vows beneath a sculptural wooden arch surrounded by fragrant lilacs and roses,** profusions of lilies and dahlias, and flowering white cherry, apple, and plum trees. As night falls, hanging candles and fairy lights begin to twinkle from the arms of the pines, accenting a sky full of stars overhead. 
  * **Make the Manor your personal retreat for a day or a weekend.** Most packages feature exclusive use of the manor and grounds for your celebration, overnight accommodations for up to 18 people, and a full-service breakfast each morning to fuel the fun. Plus, wedding planning and coordination is included, ensuring all you need to worry about is... well, nothing!
