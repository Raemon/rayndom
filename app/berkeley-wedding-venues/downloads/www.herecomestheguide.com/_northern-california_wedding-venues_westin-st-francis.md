## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Known as the Grand Dame of Union Square, this turn-of-the-century hotel** has long been a symbol of elegance in San Francisco. In the Landmark Building, you’ll find stunning ballrooms with gilt pillars, intricately carved ceilings, and more than a hundred years’ worth of history, like the Borgia Room, a jewel-box chamber with oak-paneled walls, a marble fireplace, and a vaulted, delicately painted ceiling. 
  * **For a more contemporary ambiance, whisk your guests up to the 32nd floor** of the Tower Building, aptly named St. Francis Heights. The two premier spaces here, The Golden Gate Room and The Mission Bay Room, offer sophisticated settings along with breathtaking floor-to-ceiling views that extend from the Bay Bridge to the Golden Gate—the nighttime display of city lights is dazzling! 
  * **Bespoke pricing is curated to meet your unique needs and desires,** with flexibility based on space, date, time, and guest count (a full hosted bar is included in every option, adding great value to your package). Intimate weddings are welcome, as well: the St. Francis Suite is just right for a smaller ceremony and reception, especially when paired with the outdoor terraces for an indoor/outdoor flow.
