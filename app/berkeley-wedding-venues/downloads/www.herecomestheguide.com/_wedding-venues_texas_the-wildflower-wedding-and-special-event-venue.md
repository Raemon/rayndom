## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on 50 acres of meadows and its beautiful namesake wildflowers,** this East Texas venue offers a pastoral, peaceful vibe but is an easy drive from Dallas and its suburbs. Photo ops abound: snap romantic portraits in a rowboat on the lake, on a "bicycle built for two," or with the sweet resident llamas.
  * **Whether you say "I do" at the edge of the pond or beneath the oak and cedar trees,** your ceremony will be picture-perfect. Follow with cocktails and games on the lawn, and a reception in the dreamy, barn-inspired event room. Don't forget to book their custom camper photo booth to capture all the fun.
  * **Spend the night in one of their custom glamping yurts,** which are climate-controlled and comfy with interior restrooms, cute kitchen areas, and inviting boho-chic styling. This is glamping at its finest!
