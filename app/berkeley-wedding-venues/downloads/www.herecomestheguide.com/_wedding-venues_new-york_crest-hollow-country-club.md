## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The South Beach-style pool deck is an ideal place for an opulent outdoor wedding** , with shady palm trees, fountains, fire pits—even a white sand beach!
  * **Art Deco inspiration meets “contemporary chic” in the sleek ballrooms** , whose flexible floor plans and neutral color palettes allow them to easily transform to a variety of themes, from retro lounge party to refined, multi-course dinner.
  * **Your wedding banquet can feature customized traditional favorites** , or delicacies that span the globe. Crest Hollow’s international menus offer favorite dishes from Russian, Italian, Caribbean, Indian, Latin, Asian, and Persian traditions, and the club even boasts a separate orthodox glatt kosher kitchen.
