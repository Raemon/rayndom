## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The spacious outdoor patio has a romantic, European park vibe.** With arched entryways, old fashioned street lamps, fountains, and blooming hedges, it's a great spot for an outdoor ceremony and/or cocktails.
  * **The Garden Reception Room whimsically blurs the line between inside and out.** Light and airy with an exposed-beam ceiling, polished dance floor, and paper lanterns, it also features white picket fencing and trees wrapped in twinkle lights.
  * **A stylish dressing room has great lighting and three elegant make-up stations** for primping. But the other wedding party gets a cool spot of their own with satellite TV to catch part of the game while getting ready.
