## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched on a hill just a few miles from the blue Pacific,** this club offers a just-right marriage between lovely landscaped grounds and contemporary, sophisticated architecture. Packages are generous and customizable, and the experienced staff will help with all your decisions, from choosing the right linens to selecting your menu and signature drinks.
  * **A gently terraced walkway leads to your oceanview ceremony,** which is set on a expansive lawn bounded by acres of tree-studded fairways. While the wedding party poses for photos on the picturesque grounds, everyone else heads up to the shaded clubhouse terrace for mingling over drinks and hors d'oeuvres. 
  * **The ballroom****and its adjoining patio exemplify modern-meets-rustic vibes:** the rich, midnight blue carpet laced with a silvery pattern is a bold complement to the white walls and natural, pine-beamed ceiling and wrought-iron chandeliers. A working fireplace adds warmth, and wraparound windows ensure fabulous views from every seat.
