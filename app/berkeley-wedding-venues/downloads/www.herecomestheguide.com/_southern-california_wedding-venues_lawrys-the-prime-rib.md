## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Steeped in seven decades of L.A. history, rich British/American culinary tradition and Beverly Hills elegance,** this beloved spot is an icon on Hollywood's Restaurant Row. They've served delectable (and award-winning) Anglo-British cuisine with a playful flourish since the venue's founding in 1938, and now happily lend its cherished traditions to your celebration.
  * **As you step inside the foyer, you'll be whisked away into a world of timeless, Old World luxury.** Tasteful period furniture in the cocktail room and adjacent bar area complements wainscoted, jewel-toned walls. Antique chandeliers and sconces illuminate eye-catching polished silver pieces and gold-framed paintings of English nobles, dignitaries and countryside scenes. 
  * **Double doors lead into the brilliant, emerald-colored Oak Room,** where you can exchange vows against a majestic fireplace mantel adorned with a bust of the Duke of Wellington and a bas-relief of William Shakespeare. Larger celebrations are held in the spacious main dining room, beneath an uplit, domed ceiling that casts a subtle glow on the dark wooden columns and beveled glass for a festive feel.
