## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on 12 sweeping waterfront acres, this colonial-era estate** blends 17th-century history with storybook scenery. Manicured gardens are lush with native plantings and thoughtfully tended flower beds, and soft breezes off the Corsica River drift through the century-old trees that surround the historic property.
  * **You’ll say your vows beneath the shade of mature oaks,** then enjoy cocktails poolside and dinner on the flagstone patio—never far from the glassy waters of the river. Or, take the party inside the 1735 Crown and Anchor Inn, where the gathering spaces are flooded with natural light and adorned with gracious fireplaces for a cozy charm.
  * **With luxurious overnight lodging for twelve of your nearest and dearest,** your wedding will feel like a weekend away. Take advantage of quiet mornings on the nature trails, playful afternoons on the bocce court, and sun-kissed evenings around the fire pits or on the private dock.
