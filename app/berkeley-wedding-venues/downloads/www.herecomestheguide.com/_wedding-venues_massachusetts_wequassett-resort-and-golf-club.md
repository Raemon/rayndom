## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This exquisitely romantic Cape Cod resort occupies the perfect spot along Pleasant Bay,** with cozy waterfront cottages, lavish dining, world-class golf, and easy access to all of the Cape’s popular attractions.
  * **The Grand Lawn sits right at the water’s edge,** offering unobstructed ocean views for totally dreamy ceremonies. Follow with a grand reception in the Pavilion, or an intimate affair on the Garden Terrace—each one boasts subtle, coastal-inspired décor and stellar views.
  * **For a cool, indoor/outdoor vibe, check out The Outer Bar—** thoughtfully designed to incorporate a six-peaked tent and glass wraparound walls, it’s an incredible spot from which to enjoy the magical bay sunsets.
