## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked on 55 lushly wooded acres, this romantic hidden gem** is a serene oasis surrounded by the rolling hills of Loudon County, just minutes from the heart of D.C. It’s a luxurious retreat that’s also surprisingly affordable, with passionate, service-minded staff, transparent and flexible packages, and an upscale elegance you won’t find anywhere else.
  * **Two cascading staircases lead onto a gorgeous al fresco terrace,** where you can exchange vows against a panoramic natural backdrop. Inside, the manor’s timeless architecture exudes luxury, with sparkling crystal chandeliers, intricately carved mouldings, warm fireplaces adorned with gold detailing, and exquisite multi-paned windows that flood the space with glowing natural light.
  * **It’s made for wonderful wedding weekends, with luxe on-site lodging** that invites you to soak in every moment with your loved ones. Six plush bedrooms—each with en-suites—are joined by light-filled gathering areas, well-equipped kitchens, a dining room, media room, game room, a large indoor sauna, and a fire pit surrounded by Adirondack chairs for lounging under the stars.
