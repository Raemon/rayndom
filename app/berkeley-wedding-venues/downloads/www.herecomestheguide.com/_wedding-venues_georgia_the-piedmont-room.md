## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It makes a great first impression.** The stone façade, curved wrought-iron gates and spherical sconces at the entrance exude elegance.
  * **The space is dramatic.** The Piedmont Room boasts a 30-foot ceiling and 12-foot windows with exceptional views of Piedmont Park and the Midtown skyline.
  * **There are lots of fun menu options.** You can get creative with stations featuring shrimp and grits martinis, hash browns or stir fry, a mini-burger bar, a seasonal display or a gourmet buffet. And these are just a few of the possibilities!
