## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Miami sophistication meets pristine beachfront at this intimate resort,** which is owned by iconic Florida tastemakers Gloria and Emilio Estefan. This stylish escape’s chic design and oceanfront setting make it a popular spot for destination getaways… and even better for a magical wedding weekend in Vero Beach.
  * **Intimate ceremonies may be held on the white sand beach,** with the soft crashing of ocean waves and the calling of birds as your soundtrack. A pretty interior courtyard is another option, with the Cabana Bar a popular setting for golden hour cocktails around a cozy fire pit as the glowing sun sinks into the sea.
  * **You’ll feel pampered by all the perks of your all-inclusive package,** which offers couples an oceanfront suite with romantic amenities, complimentary valet service for guests, and a custom tiered wedding cake. Their experienced wedding team orchestrates every detail behind the scenes, so you can enjoy the party stress-free.
