## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Breathtaking panoramic views of the harbor, dazzling crystal chandeliers** , and a mahogany and stained-glass bar make the 4th-floor ballroom a stunning location for your party.
  * **Décor with a Latin flair gives the 1st-floor Cabaret a unique ambiance.** The venue also comes with a gorgeous hardwood floor for dancing and access to the Plaza courtyard, a garden setting that's ideal for outdoor ceremonies and cocktail receptions.
  * **City Lites on the 2nd floor boasts a fun lounge-like atmosphere** , highlighted by a vignette of the historic White Tower Diner, a centerpiece attraction when this building housed the City Life Museums. 
  * **The charming Carrollton Inn just across the garden** offers 13 boutique-style rooms and suites with all the modern amenities your guests will need to feel at home.
