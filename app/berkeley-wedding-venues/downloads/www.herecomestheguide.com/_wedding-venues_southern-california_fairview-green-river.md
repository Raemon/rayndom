## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked into the verdant Santa Ana valley where the OC meets the Inland Empire,** this 560-acre property is truly exquisite, filled with rolling hills, trees, and lakes, and bisected by the winding Santa Ana River. On top of the stunning setting, you'll also enjoy their truly wallet-friendly, all-inclusive packages, with an events team on hand to ensure your celebration unfolds effortlessly.
  * **Three enchanting ceremony sites each offer a picture-perfect setting for your vows.** One is a garden, bounded by a trellised fence alongside the immaculately groomed fairway. The second, a lovely gazebo, provides a vista of the Santa Ana mountain range, while the third sits atop a green expanse of lawn with an up-close view of the nearby hills.
  * **Guests enter the Spanish Revival-style clubhouse into the gracious foyer,** then might mingle with cocktails in an adjacent peach-hued room. When it's time for the reception everyone gathers in the inviting banquet room, which is adorned with large picture windows and subtle recessed lighting in a coffered ceiling. The lovely neutral color palate provides a wonderful canvas for your unique style.
