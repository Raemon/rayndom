## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked in the heart of the city, this grand, three-story, Italianate mansion** retains all of its 19th-century charm. With its façade of porches, galleries, and balconies framed in ornate wrought-iron, it’s a shining example of classic New Orleans architecture. 
  * **Wed in the charming brick courtyard,** where you’ll find trickling fountains, lush tropical foliage, and the gorgeous residence itself as your backdrop. After you’ve toasted and mingled here a bit, move inside to the double parlor for a reception wrapped in timeless elegance. 
  * **The luxe, comfortable rooms of the bed and breakfast** can house the bulk of your wedding party—you can even reserve the lovely Corner Store, Carriage House, and Creole House in their entirety to accommodate large groups.
