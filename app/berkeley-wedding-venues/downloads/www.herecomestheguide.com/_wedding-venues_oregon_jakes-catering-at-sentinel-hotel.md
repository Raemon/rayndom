  * **The beautiful ballrooms are right out of a fairy tale.** The high ceiling, elegant white pillars and ornate décor of the Governor Ballroom will wow your guests, as will the Grand Ballroom’s curved ceiling panels and gold color scheme.
  * **Several additional spaces each have their own personality** , and the professional lighting and decorating team can customize the ambiance to complement your event. The Renaissance Room is striking, with gold marble, arches, intricate ceiling details, large windows and twinkling chandeliers. In the Library, the dark wood octagonal ceiling pattern and gold marble fireplace exude comfort, while other rooms feature an abundance of natural light, large mirrors and paneled walls.
