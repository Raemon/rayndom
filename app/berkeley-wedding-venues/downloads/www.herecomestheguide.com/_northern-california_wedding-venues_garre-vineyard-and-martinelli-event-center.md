## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

Garré Vineyard & Winery is a bit like a small village—a charming one surrounded by grapevines. One of the Livermore Valley’s original wineries, this gem, with its Italian Wine Country style, has always drawn a crowd. Maybe it’s because of the café on the premises, the park-like setting, the Tasting Room, or the jazz they serve up with the food and the bocce ball. 

That property has increased with Bella Rosa, Garré’s stunning new event center. Old-fashioned 19th-century streetlamps line the paths and illuminate the area at night. One walkway leads up to a small stage bordered by flowerbeds and Italian cypress and backed by rows of Cabernet vines—it’s a lovely spot for a ceremony. Just steps away, the event center features a full bar, hardwood floors, distinctive chandeliers, and vineyard views through large arched picture windows. It’s an incredibly flexible space for a reception, and a marvelous place to sample the masterful pairings of food and wine recommended and prepared by their Executive Chef and highly trained culinary staff. Two full-size bocce ball courts that are lit at night offer a before- and after-dinner diversion, adding to the Old World ambiance.

Tours of Garré Winery’s event sites are by appointment only. We suggest that to really experience what Garré is like, make a reservation for lunch or dinner, too. That way you’ll be able to stroll the grounds, take in the views, and taste their award-winning food and wine.
