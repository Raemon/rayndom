## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The mountains are calling and you must go…** to this dreamy Creede Valley hideaway,**** perched at 2,400 feet with sweeping views of Miners Creek and the surrounding valley. Cozy on-site cabins invite you to linger all weekend in this beautiful place—from rehearsal dinner to ceremony to reception to complimentary breakfast on your final morning.
  * **The handcrafted, two-story post-and-beam barn offers a sense of rustic elegance** with all the modern amenities you need to throw a great party, including a prep kitchen, built-in bar, stone fireplace, and a covered patio blessed by soft mountain breezes and the sound of the creek.
  * **A beautiful open-air pavilion sits alongside the burbling creek,** creating a magical atmosphere for your exchange of vows. Golden light gently caresses the mountains and meadows that spread out behind the altar, with the occasional grazing horse adding to the Western-chic vibe.
