## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked into a shady grove on the edge of the forest,** this family-run farm is a dream for nature lovers. Intimate weddings are especially lovely here, thanks to beautifully curated gathering spaces, rustic farm details, and a warm, welcoming touch from the dedicated owners, who will work with you every step of the way.
  * **The unique open-air “chapel” nestles seamlessly among the mossy oaks:** The architecturally dynamic house-without-walls structure is hung with green-glass chandeliers and finished with a Florida-chic white shell floor and two stained-glass panels to make a truly one-of-a-kind setting for your “I do”s.
  * **Mingle amid the seasonal blooms, twinkle-lit trees, and cozy fire pits in the Garden** , a sweet hideaway perfect for cocktail hours and receptions. A grassy lawn is perfect for tenting, with lovely views of the surrounding pastures and forest. You might even spot one of their roaming goats (they’ve been known to photobomb).
