## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A sleek, contemporary option for bespoke, intimate celebrations,** this thoughtfully designed space sits just west of Chicago, and is directly across the street from the Belmont Metra station, making it ultra-convenient for guests who wish to travel in from the city. 
  * **The Auditorium’s two flexible studios boast a chic, industrial-minimalist design,** with a blend of organic and manmade materials, ample natural light, and lush green accents like hanging plants and a cool indoor ivy wall that makes an striking backdrop for ceremonies. 
  * **An experienced onsite event manager will assist throughout the entire day—** they’ll accept your deliveries, manage vendors, execute your timeline and decor setup, and even coordinate the venue cleanup and packing up of personal items.
