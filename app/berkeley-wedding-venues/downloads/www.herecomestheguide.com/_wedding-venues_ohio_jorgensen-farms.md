## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Family-run by a fifth generation farmer,** this working organic farm sits in an idyllic Central Ohio valley, surrounded by acres of floral and herb gardens, pastures, and gently rolling hills. 
  * **Wed in the pastoral fields,** followed by a celebration in either the rustic post and beam barn, or the utterly striking Lord & Burnham greenhouse, where soaring glass walls and ceiling are supported by iron and virgin cypress. 
  * **Your dinner menu and floral décor will feature organic treasures** sourced from nearby farms whenever possible—including the very farm you're at! Guests will delight in the tastes, sights, and aromas of this luscious bounty; it just doesn’t get any more seasonal or local than this.
