  * **Nestled in the lush foothills where the Hudson Valley meets the Berkshires,** this charming bed & breakfast specializes in custom-designed celebrations set amid pristine natural beauty. The boutique inn setting creates an intimate atmosphere where your entire celebration can unfold over multiple days, giving everyone time to relax and soak in each moment.
  * **Their all-inclusive approach** **means you’ll have the assistance of their experienced events team** to help you curate your perfect destination getaway. Whether you picture a spectacular summer soiree beneath a sailcloth tent, an intimate winter elopement before the fire in the Great Room, or a rustic-chic ceremony before the classic red barn, they’ll coordinate with local services and vendors to bring your vision to life.
  * **The timeless post-and-beam Inn houses eleven gorgeous guest rooms,** each uniquely designed with an elevated pastoral aesthetic and thoughtfully weathered patina. Its ideal location provides easy access to local vineyards, farm-to-table dining, and world-class cultural institutions, or feel free to simply enjoy the seclusion of nature and the presence of your loved ones.
