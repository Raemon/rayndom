## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This family-run venue in lovely Caroline County** boasts a century-old barn and farmhouse, sweeping views of the surrounding countryside, and a super-convenient location just 90 minutes from Washington D.C.
  * **Opt to exchange vows in an open meadow,** in front of the weathered barn, or in the chapel...whatever you choose, your ceremony photos will be oh-so-pretty. Host your reception in the barn, or on the grounds beneath the gorgeous Virginia sky.
  * **They offer so many great perks,** including cute rural décor, a photo booth, and dressing area. Whether you can't wait to DIY or would rather let the staff take care of everything, you're certain to have a picture-perfect day.
