## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Just a quick hop across the Queensboro Bridge,** this sleek, bright events venue consists of several rooftop and adjoining indoor spaces, all boasting incredible views of the NYC skyline.
  * **Host a grand affair in the industrial-chic Main Space** **and Terrace,** or something more intimate in the Penthouse and Rooftop. The outdoor areas can be tented in the event of rain—consider a clear-walled style, so you won’t miss out on that panorama!
  * **Your rental period is a generous sixteen hours,** and you’re able to bring in vendors of your choosing (with the exception of those for tenting and furnishings). You also have the option for a full-venue buyout, or to rent each space individually.



### PRICES: _What's this going to cost?_
