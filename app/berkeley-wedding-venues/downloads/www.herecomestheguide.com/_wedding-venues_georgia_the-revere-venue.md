## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Inspired by luxury resorts and surrounded by acres of North Georgia’s rural beauty,** this unique private venue boasts beautiful grounds and elegant, Craftsman-inspired architecture that offer bountiful options for creating the perfect wedding weekend. (Ever imagined a dramatic departure by helicopter? That can be arranged—there’s a helipad right on site!)
  * **The stunning, light-filled, two-story event space** features a dazzling whitewashed interior with a soaring, open-trussed ceiling and dozens of oversized windows. A covered patio serves wonderfully for post-ceremony cocktails, and the second-floor, open-air deck makes a fabulous outdoor lounge. 
  * **How about an entire home as your private dressing suite?** Revere’s dreamy Estate can sleep fourteen, and boasts makeup stations, a bar on each level, and an inviting pool. In the Lodge, you’ll find another finely appointed spot, complete with a hot tub, bunk room, pool table and outdoor grill. At over 6,000 square feet, the Lodge can also serve as another function option for the weekend’s activities.
