## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located on the iconic Asbury Park boardwalk,** this stylish space was designed to emulate the sleek supper clubs of a bygone era…with a distinctively contemporary twist. There are plenty of nearby hotels and resorts, so you’ll have no trouble choosing the ideal wedding weekend lodging. 
  * **Inside the mid-century modern-inspired building,** you’ll find a gorgeous circular space with floor-ceiling windows offering views of the Atlantic and of the boardwalk’s historic buildings. The Club can accommodate both ceremonies and receptions, but you may also opt to say “I do” on the sands of Fifth Avenue Beach (your event planner can help arrange the required permits.)
  * **They offer a collection of generous packages** to meet a range of styles and budgets, including cocktail party-style and breakfast affairs, and each package can be customized with fun enhancements like a pretzel bar, wing station, or ice cream pop station.
