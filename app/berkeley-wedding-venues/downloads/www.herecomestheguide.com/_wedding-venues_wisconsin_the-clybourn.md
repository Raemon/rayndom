## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Right at the heart of downtown Milwaukee****on the campus of Marquette University,** this artfully restored turn-of-the-century brick building features just the right mix of vintage charm, industrial style, and thoughtfully planned amenities. 
  * **The interior boasts weathered brick,** **wood beams, and a spacious layout** with tons of room for dancing. Gorgeous custom lighting and a dramatic skylight illuminate the space, and there are lounges on both the lower and main floors. 
  * **Packages are refreshingly affordable,** and you’re welcome to bring in any vendors of your choosing, including your own beverages. There are dressing rooms available on site, and since they only host one wedding per day, you’ll have lots of privacy and won’t feel rushed.
