## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This 1914 mansion-turned-boutique inn in Shelburne** is made for destination wedding weekends, with 38 private acres of gardens and meadows, a stone patio, and a perfect size for intimate celebrations of up to 50 guests.
  * **Easy-to-understand, affordable rental rates encourage creativity.** You might exchange vows in the gardens or before the stone fireplace in the lobby, mingle in the cocktail lounge or on the sunny enclosed porch, and gather under the stars on the stone patio, where you can enjoy delicious food prepared by any caterer you like—or use the commercial kitchen to provide your own!
  * **Weekend-style buyouts are perfect for intimate destination weddings.** You’ll have total access to the whole property, from the acres of landscaped grounds to the inn’s charming event spaces, to the seven designer suites, which offer convenient on-site accommodations for your loved ones.
