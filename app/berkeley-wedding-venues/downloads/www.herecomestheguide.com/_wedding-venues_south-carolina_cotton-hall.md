## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With a history dating back to the late 1700s,** this lovely property features sprawling lawns and hundreds of moss-draped oaks, all surrounding a lovely 1920s Georgian Revival mansion. 
  * **Exchange vows beneath the graceful trees,** followed by a cocktail reception that flows from the main house onto the pretty grounds. A tented reception ensures your guests can still soak in the gorgeous surroundings as the sun sets beyond the oaks. 
  * **It’s a bed and breakfast, too!** Book a night just for yourselves, or rent out all five charming bedrooms for the weekend. Stroll the grounds, have a picnic on the lawn, take a dip in the pool, or simply snuggle up with a good book—this is the perfect spot to slow down and enjoy the tranquility.
