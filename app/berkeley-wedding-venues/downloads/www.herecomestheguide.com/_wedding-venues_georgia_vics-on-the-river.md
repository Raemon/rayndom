## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set right along the edge of the Savannah River in the heart of the city’s Historic District,** this historic brownstone is big on charm, with a location that offers wonderful views of the waterfront.
  * **The Stoddard Room is a light-filled space with cream-toned walls,** wood flooring, and a high ceiling whose exposed beams are hung with candelabra chandeliers. Two private patios allow guests to step out and enjoy the river scene below.
  * **For smaller affairs, there’s Victor Hall and The Dieter’s Den—** both boast oversized windows and plenty of charming vintage details, bringing a touch of grandeur to your intimate celebration.
