## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Idyllically perched above meandering Soquel Creek, this wondrous winery** is blessed by crisp, clean air and a profusion of sunny days that keeps everything green and flourishing. The oldest working winery in picturesque Santa Cruz Wine Country, it's still run by the third generation of the Bargetto family, who invite you to share in their Old World hospitality and celebrate amidst this sublime setting.
  * **Ceremonies are held on a tiled creekside courtyard** flanked by a long, weathered bar and prettily landscaped with espaliered vines and seasonal blooms. Continue the celebration here, dancing the night away beneath the moonlit canopy as the rushing waters of the stream add to the musical backdrop.
  * **Curved burnished redwood doors open to the La Vita Room,** an elegant Mediterranean-style space just off the courtyard. The coordinating interior boasts exquisitely crafted chandeliers, ceiling beams, and an entire redwood-lined wall, handcrafted from antique wine casks, themselves hewn from fallen 500-year-old trees.
