## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled in the bustling LoDo district** and offering both Rocky Mountain and vibrant street scene panoramas, this inviting restaurant blends chic industrial elegance with the gracious, welcoming vibe of an intimate European neighborhood bistro. 
  * **Say an unforgettable “I do” on the historic Wewatta Street Railroad Bridge,** a striking vintage steel beauty spanning Denver’s iconic Cherry Creek. It’s located directly adjacent to the restaurant, so you can revel over the water and under the stars while enjoying freshly prepared farm-to-fork dinners (everything—from the bread to your custom cake—is made from scratch in their kitchens).
  * **It’s owned and operated by a truly stellar husband and wife team.** Lauded Chef Tom Coohill creates dreamy menus inspired by his classical French training and highlighting the best seasonal and regional ingredients. Diane Coohill brings more than 30 years of event and restaurant expertise to the operation—in her caring, detail-oriented hands, you’re guaranteed a gorgeous, worry-free celebration.
