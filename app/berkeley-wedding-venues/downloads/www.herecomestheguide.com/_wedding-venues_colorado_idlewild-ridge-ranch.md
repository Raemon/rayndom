## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With a stunning backdrop of Pikes Peak National Forest,** this mountain getaway retreat is ideal for intimate, rustic-chic weddings. Spend the weekend exploring the 21-acre estate, or taking easy day trips to local favorites like Eleven Mile Canyon, Garden of the Gods, and Florissant Fossil Beds.
  * **They have three gorgeous ceremony sites on the property,** each with its own beautiful backdrop:**** mountain, aspen grove, or evergreen forest. You'll also have access to the barn for the whole two-night stay, meaning you'll have plenty of time to decorate, host a karaoke welcome party or movie night, and throw a rollicking reception— it's fully equipped with a catering area, a top-of-the-line sound system, a covered deck with a portable bar, and plenty of sparkling twinkle lights for a romantic touch.
  * **There’s on-site lodging for up to sixteen guests,** with fun options like “glamping” platform tents, a historic cabin, and hammocks, with plenty of space for hanging al fresco... along with your furry friends! Camping is also permitted, and additional overnighters will find plentiful vacation rentals in the surrounding towns.
