## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

**• Lovely scenery unfolds in every direction** on the golf course, designed by Greg Norman. Palm trees, fountains and a flower-bedecked pergola all add to the romantic ambiance. Say your vows under a gazebo by the lake, or pose for photos on a gently curved bridge—you may even be lucky enough to catch a dazzling sunset!

**• Wedding specialists are ready to help with all of the details** of your big day, from decorations and flowers to planning a buffet or three-course plated dinner.

**• It’s centrally located in Pompano Beach** , very close to Fort Lauderdale Airport and midway between Miami and Palm Beach.
