## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nature meets Industrial Chic at this modern winery** , where sleek indoor spaces open onto lush urban gardens. Capture awesome photos in the barrel rooms, under the shady trees, or in front of the cool concrete water feature with a lovely waterfall on one end.
  * **Floor-to-ceiling windows in the Terrace Room offer views** of both the gardens and tank room. Got foodies on your guest list? Open up the oversized sliding doors so they can watch the chef and culinary team work their magic.
  * **You’re granted exclusive use of the venue’s outdoor areas.** Following your ceremony in the courtyard, guests can explore the grounds, sip drinks and nibble appetizers from the grill, or enjoy a game of bocce ball.
