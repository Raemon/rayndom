## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Your entire wedding can be held outdoors.** Choose a ceremony on the rooftop terrace with the Blue Ridge Mountains in the background…under the front veranda of the grand home…or on the “carriage steps”, with your guests seated on a lawn overlooking pastures and ponds.
  * **The custom ballroom is a blend of vintage charm and contemporary amenities.** Though newly built and fully outfitted for modern weddings, the ballroom’s wood floor, sparkling chandeliers and rows of French doors blend seamlessly with the Manor’s classic style.
  * **You’re given exclusive access to the entire estate** , which can be rented for the weekend. Spend the night in one of the home’s four beautiful guest suites, and make use the of the Manor’s other rooms and grounds for your rehearsal dinner, morning-after brunch, or even a family picnic or barbecue.
