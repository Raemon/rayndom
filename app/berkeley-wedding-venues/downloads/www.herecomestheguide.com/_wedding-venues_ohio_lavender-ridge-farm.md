## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This tranquil sanctuary is both a pastoral event venue and a working lavender farm,** nestled on 35 acres of wildflowers and pollinator gardens, apiaries, and thoughtfully tended forests. The stunning surroundings offer tons of options for your al fresco ceremony: You might say “I do” on the stone patio, among the trees or the colorful blooms, or before the stylish white barn.
  * **The custom-built event barn exudes modern farmhouse luxury,** with sleek black trim, large windows, and beautifully draped wooden beams that add a rustic charm to the crisp white interiors. You’ll have access to their extensive collection of in-house décor, making it easy to customize the space to match your vision.
  * **One-of-a-kind details abound, like their adorable “Farm Favors,”** which might include tiny honey jars, lavender sachets, or soap minis. Micro-weddings and elopements are just as welcome as larger gatherings, and the owners’ passion for the property is reflected in their hands-on care for wedding couples.
