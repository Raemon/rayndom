## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Once a private retreat, this tucked-away park is now a beloved community icon,** set on 50 acres of beautifully preserved conservation land in Groveland’s North Shore. Romantic backdrops abound: Snap photos before the sun-sparkling pond, steal a kiss among the soaring pines, or wander the carriage paths between the “I do”s and dancing.
  * **A gracious hilltop lawn surrounded by lush meadows, woodlands, and forest** is a favorite setting for outdoor ceremonies. The Great Hall, once a chapel, is now a gorgeous gathering place, with stunning wooden buttressed ceilings and tall windows that invite ample natural light.
  * **Creativity and customization is welcomed, with affordable rates** and flexible vendor policies designed to let your imagination soar. Whether you envision an intimate elopement or a grand South Asian gathering**,** a tented summertime reception or a cozy dinner before a roaring fire, you’re free to bring your unique vision to life.
