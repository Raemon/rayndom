## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The natural stone waterfall adds a romantic touch** as a backdrop for your poolside ceremony. And their large, covered Patio Terrace offers a lovely oasis to say “I do” while enjoying beautiful garden and golf course views.
  * **Gracious in every way, the Clubhouse’s Roberts Room** boasts tall arched windows and impressive chandeliers. The gleaming wood dance floor and tables set with the finest napery and bone china complete the warmly elegant reception setting.
  * **Their attentive personal service goes from sweet to sweeter.** Even with complimentary champagne and hors d’oeuvres for you and your sweetie upon arrival—plus the mouthwatering dishes tailored for your event and the custom-designed cake—there’s still room for their signature Candy Buffet to end the evening on a (sugar) high note.
