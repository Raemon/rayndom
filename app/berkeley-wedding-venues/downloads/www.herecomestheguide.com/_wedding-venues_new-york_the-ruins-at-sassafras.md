## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Once the site of a thriving Shaker settlement,** this beautiful property is now under the ownership of a family dedicated to unearthing its treasures and sharing them with the world through its museum, celebration venues, and lodgings.
  * **There are eight event sites across the lush grounds,** allowing you to craft the day's flow exactly as you wish. We love the idea of ceremony at Deere Pond, with its graceful weeping willow, and a tented reception amid the romantic, stacked-stone Ruins.
  * **Accommodate up to eighteen overnight guests** across three artfully restored buildings—The Stone House, Caretaker’s Cottage, and Smoke House all feature double rooms and countless charming, vintage-inspired design touches.
