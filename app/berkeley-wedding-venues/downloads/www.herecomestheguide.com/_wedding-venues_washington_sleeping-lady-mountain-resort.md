## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled in a pine-covered valley along Icicle Creek** just outside the popular Bavarian-styled town of Leavenworth (an easy, beautiful jaunt east from Seattle), this idyllic, historic mountain escape spans 67 acres of unspoiled alpine beauty. 
  * **An elevated platform overlooking the woods** creates a natural, outdoor cathedral for vows. Indoor ceremonies may be held in the Chapel Theater, which connects to the Salmon Gallery, with its towering stone walls and vaulted ceiling. Outside, a string-lit patio provides additional space to gather beneath the stars.
  * **On-site accommodations provide overnight space for everyone,** and include gracious hotel-style rooms and three inviting cabins, one of which is great for families or small groups. Be sure to set some time aside for a stint at Aspen Leaf, the resort’s awesome day spa!
