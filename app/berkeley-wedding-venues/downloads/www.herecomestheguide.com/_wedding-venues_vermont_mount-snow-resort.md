## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This beloved southern Vermont destination** has been a favorite of both locals and travelers for generations due to its lush year-round beauty and easy accessibility from southern metro areas. Best of all, there’s room for every guest across a huge range of condos, townhomes, and within the gracious charm of the Grand Summit Resort Hotel. 
  * **In warm weather months, the hotel’s Grand Summit Patio** hosts gorgeous al fresco ceremonies and cocktail hours. Just steps away, the Wedding Garden stands ready for open-air celebrations with a backdrop of the mountain’s slopes. For winter and fall nuptials, opt for the new, contemporary-chic Carinthia Lodge (we adore the floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace), or the hotel’s traditionally lovely Somerset Grand Ballroom. 
  * **Still feeling a little overwhelmed by all these incredible options? Not to worry—** the wedding experts at Vail Resorts (who operate this, and over 40 desirable mountain properties) are absolute stars at helping you navigate it all, whether it’s finding the perfect venue, choosing a place for your rehearsal dinner, or coordinating group lodging.
