## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Built in 1918, this historic home is set on 11 verdant acres** , surrounded by miles of farmland at the base of the Conejo foothills. Still family-owned after over a century, it's a truly welcoming place—and you'll feel it from the moment you step foot onto the property and encounter the quaint main house, a white wood-frame Colonial with a trio of dormer windows and a broad brick veranda edged in fragrant star jasmine.
  * **A lovely arch brimming with honeysuckle frames the couple** as they exchange vows in the Garden, reached by a small flagstone path beside the house. At the center of the gracious site sits a stone birdbath encircled with lacy blooms, and the fluttering of sparrow wings and the occasional butterfly make it seem like spring any time of year.
  * **There's plenty of room for dining & dancing on the circular lawn. **Flowers are everywhere—some in pots, some growing wild like a delicate dusting of confetti. Dining tables face a thicket of colorful jacarandas, palms, pine trees and all manner of leafy foliage. At night, Tivoli lights twinkle through the jasmine, and Japanese lanterns glow softly like candlelight.
