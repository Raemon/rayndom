## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Situated on a dreamy 43 acres****along a slope of Mt. Tamalpais,** this historic home is rooted in love: it was designed by one of San Francisco’s most prominent architects, Willis Polk, and was a gift from Ralston White to his bride, Ruth. Now, the property is a non-profit organization, so all funds received go straight towards the preservation and maintenance of this beloved retreat.
  * **Hold your ceremony on the mansion’s heart-shaped lawn.** While your guests enjoy cocktails, you can take photos on the lush redwood paths, followed by a celebration in the home’s inviting living room, or outdoors, in a grove beneath the stars. 
  * **The retreat can provide overnight accommodations for up to 35 guests,** ranging from a self-contained apartment to private and semi-private rooms, nearly all of which offer lovely views of the surrounding forest.



### PRICES: _What's this going to cost?_

###### Rental Fee

  * **$5,700–21,950/event**
  * Rental fee varies depending on: 
    * Day of week
    * Type of event
    * Overnight or day-use event

  * _Because it is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, all rental fees go towards the preservation and maintenance of the Ralston White Retreat._
