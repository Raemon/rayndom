## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Your destination wedding, embraced by nature.** A short drive from Seattle and a breathtaking ferry ride bring you and your guests to beautiful Lakedale, which offers the best of the Pacific Northwest: trees, water, and orcas!
  * **With 82 acres of sparkling lakes, towering forests, and golden meadows** , there are dozens of stunning backdrops for your celebration. Say "I do" in a picturesque spot beside a lake and dance the night away under the stars, or opt for a warm, romantic event beside the fireplace in the Great Room. 
  * **Guest accommodations are unique and fun.** Your friends and family may have a hard time returning to the mainland after spending the weekend in one of the romantic lodge rooms, the friendly log cabins, or the plush yurts, which boast inviting hot tubs.
