## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This enchanting Queen Anne-style hilltop residence, set on nine landscaped acres,** was originally built in 1890 by the founder of the quaint surrounding town of Piru. Today, the landmark property has been thoroughly restored and brought back to brilliant life, now boasting modern amenities, lush gardens and exquisite décor that accentuates its vintage glamour.
  * **Through the majestic wrought-iron gates and long, rose-lined promenade,** you'll find the Park, a lovely hedged lawn in front of the mansion with a splashing fountain, panoramic mountain view, and the estate’s fairy-tale façade—a grand backdrop for exchanging vows. A nearby tiled Courtyard is a delightful locale for dining and dancing under the stars; the terraced gardens and rolling lawns that overlook the Courtyard hold more wedding options.
  * **The best way to indulge in all the mansion’s luxuries is to spend the weekend,** which also lets you expand your event into the breathtaking interior. Each room is lavished with period details, antiques and artistic restorations. The Ballroom’s magnificent stained-glass transom frames a glorious view, and is a favorite spot for individual portraits. The Dining Room, with its stunning coffered ceiling, and the stately fire-lit Library offer classic Victorian elegance.
