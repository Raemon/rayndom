## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked along a coastal inlet that offers dreamy views of Cape Newagen** **and the azure,** island-dotted Atlantic beyond, this timeless seasonal inn embodies the gracious, casually elegant feel of a classic Maine seaside resort.
  * **Colorful gardens, a wide-open lawn, a light-filled ballroom—** choose your favorite combination of these spots (and more!) to craft your dream day. The entire 20-acre property is yours for the duration of your celebration, and the staff are pros at orchestrating destination weddings. 
  * **Guests can opt for lodging in the historic hotel,** or snuggle up in one of the property’s romantic cottages. In addition to all the fun to be found in Boothbay Harbor, the Inn hosts weekly events like lobster bakes, s’mores nights, and live music at its own pub.
