## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The grounds of a pioneer-era living history museum** surround this charming venue, which, in addition to its flexible indoor and outdoor gathering spaces, offers unique photo opportunities that include a covered bridge, a vintage carousel, and views of Lake Gregory. 
  * **Cheerful red siding and crisp white trim on the rustic pole barn** create a striking backdrop against the property’s lush, mature landscape, and the barn’s interior works beautifully for events of all sizes, with its open floor plan, attached covered patio, and nearby bonfire pit. 
  * **Use of the colorful carousel and train** can be added to your celebration. Once you’re wed, you and your guests can hop on the train for a ride around the lake, past charming historic buildings, before arriving at the barn for an unforgettable night with your favorite people.
