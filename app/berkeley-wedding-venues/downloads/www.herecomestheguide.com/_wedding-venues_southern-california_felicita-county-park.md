## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The gently burbling Felicita Creek winds its way through this lovely county park,** which sits in a small valley in Southwest Escondido. Flexible rental times, multiple venue options, and affordable fees ensure a low-stress, easy-peasy process, with the ability to craft your day just as you imagine it.
  * **Exchange vows beneath the shady arms of ancient oaks,** some of which are thought to be among Southern California's largest. Thanks to its setting on the park's north end, the area feels truly secluded, though you'll still have easy access to the stunning photo ops nearby—we're particularly fond of the charming footbridges that span the year-round creek.
  * **A spacious reception area completes the lovely event knoll,** with access to a changing room, covered pavilion, and plenty of parking. Additional picnic areas are also available to reserve, with many offering amenities like an amphitheater, stage, brick barbecues, and playgrounds.
