## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A historic 1920s resort** tucked between the North and South Forks of the Hamptons, this special spot boasts classic coastal style, beautifully renovated indoor and outdoor gathering spaces, and enough year-round activities to fill even the busiest of wedding weekends. 
  * **Choose from multiple event spaces,** each with its own vintage charm. Among them, Nook or Game Room—both perfect for cozy, intimate cocktail-style affairs, and the Lawn, which hosts the grandest of celebrations and boasts postcard-worthy ocean views. 
  * **You and your guests have some truly lovely accommodation options,** between the traditional rooms in the original hotel and spacious, private cottages featuring private decks and gas fireplaces. Spend the days kayaking, on the pickleball court, or playing a round of croquet…or slip away to the full-service spa for a day of pampering.
