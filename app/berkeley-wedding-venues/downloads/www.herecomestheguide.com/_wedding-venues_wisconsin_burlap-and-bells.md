## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located just north of charming Black River Falls,** this family-run venue boasts acres of natural beauty, thoughtfully designed, rustic-chic gathering spaces, and a sweet, caring staff. Our favorite perk? Hay wagon rides to and from the wedding spot! 
  * **Each ceremony area is equally lovely—** your options include a striking grove of Norway Pines, the Cliff Top, with its endless countryside views, and the intimate, modern Vine Chapel, whose open, black metal frame supports lush vines of grapes.
  * **Host a cocktail hour nestled among the woods,** then take the reception to the covered pavilion. Lit by strings of bistro lights and featuring traditional sliding barn doors, it features a wonderful outdoor dance floor overlooking the fields.
