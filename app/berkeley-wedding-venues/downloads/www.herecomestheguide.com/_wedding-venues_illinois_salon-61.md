  * **Modern luxury meets intimate romance** at this stunning River North venue from celebrated events team  _Lettuce Entertain You._ The space is both elegant and welcoming, with charcoal gray and white harlequin marble floors, soaring glass ceilings, and grand crystal chandeliers sparkling above.
  * **Mingle over cocktails in the intimate wood-paneled Library** with its warm coffered cherry ceilings, then transition to dinner and dancing in the breathtaking Atrium, where floor-to-ceiling windows showcase views of the historic courthouse across Hubbard Street.
  * **The cuisine is exceptional, with the option to customize a menu** that suits your tastes. You’re even able to enjoy signature food stations from beloved Lettuce restaurants like an RPM raw bar and Sushi-San handroll stations.
