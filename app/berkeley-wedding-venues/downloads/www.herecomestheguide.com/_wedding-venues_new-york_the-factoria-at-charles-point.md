## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This unique private event space is perched right along the Hudson River** overlooking picturesque Lents Cove marina. Part of the multi-use Factoria complex, it’s a bit industrial, a bit nautical, and more than a bit fabulous.
  * **Inside, you’ll find exposed brick walls accented with touches of wood,** and roll-up glass doors that allow for tons of natural light. After you’re wed, wander around the Factoria to capture unforgettable photos on the docks, grounds, or the arcade at neighboring Spin Hudson. 
  * **There’s a beautiful outdoor deck—one of the largest on the Hudson—** that offers a wonderful spot for an al fresco cocktail hour, or simply a place for guests to step out and soak in the water and mountain views.
