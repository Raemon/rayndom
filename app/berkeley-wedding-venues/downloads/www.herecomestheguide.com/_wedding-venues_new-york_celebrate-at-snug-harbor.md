## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The stunning setting: 83 acres of botanical gardens** will enchant you and your guests, plus a selection of unique event spaces.
  * **The Great Hall dazzles with a 40-foot ceiling and soaring Palladian windows** , while the white tent's clear walls overlook the surrounding gardens and meadows. In the Ming Dynasty-style Chinese Scholar's Garden you'll find a series of serene walkways, pavilions, and courtyards; the Tuscan Garden provides landscaped terraces, water elements, topiaries and other delights inspired by a villa in Florence.
  * **Snug Harbor works with the area's top vendors** , ensuring you'll be paired with professionals that are a good match for you and your event. And you'll dine on cuisine that's classic—dishes are made with quality ingredients and presented in a creative way.
