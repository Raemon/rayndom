## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Al fresco events are charming****in the Dreyfuss Memorial Garden,** a parklike space filled with stone sculptures and pebbled walkways that’s well suited for everything from exchanging vows to sipping cocktails.
  * **Guests will be wowed from their first step inside** the brightly painted Welcome Center, where plenty of natural light illuminates a brilliant wall-to-wall overhead mural by acclaimed artist Odili Donald Odita.
  * **For dinner and dancing we recommend the classic Engelhard Court room** , with its marble floors, recessed archways, and access to the museum galleries, which your guests can tour during your cocktail hour.
