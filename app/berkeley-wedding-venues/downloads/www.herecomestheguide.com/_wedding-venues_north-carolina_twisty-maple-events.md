## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its idyllic, natural setting of lushly forested grounds and unobstructed mountain views,** this family-operated spot has the feel of a mini alpine retreat, but is actually just 25 minutes from downtown Asheville.
  * **There’s a sweet clearing for your vows that boats a dreamy vista** of woodlands and mountains. A clear-topped, twinkle-lit tent shelters the paved patio of the all-outdoor reception space, which also features a fun, rustic bar with an ice machine and a service window with a live-edge maple bar top.
  * **Sleep up to fourteen overnighters in the graciously appointed main house,** which boasts four bedrooms (two of which can serve as your dressing suites), a large, stocked kitchen, a fire pit and grill area, great WiFi, and access to grocery delivery services.
