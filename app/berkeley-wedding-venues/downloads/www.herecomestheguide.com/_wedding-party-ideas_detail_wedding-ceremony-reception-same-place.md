# Wedding Ceremony + Reception: Same Place or Two Different Venues?

## One location or two separate venues? THAT is the question.

[The Griffin House on the Columbia River Gorge](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/oregon/the-griffin-house-on-the-columbia-river-gorge)

  


**There's no question that all-in-one venues are preferred by the vast majority of today's wedding couples for the obvious reason: It's so much easier!** Exchange vows in the [garden](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/type/garden) or out in the [vineyards](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/type/winery-vineyard) or up on the [rooftop](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/type/penthouse-rooftop), then move on to the [ballroom](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/type/ballroom) or [barn](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/type/barn) or [terrace](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/type/patio-deck-terrace) for cocktails and reception.

**While this sequence of events has become the wedding norm, many couples are still opting for two separate event venues** —especially those that want a more specialized ceremony space!

If your wedding fantasy has always included saying "I do" in front of the [crashing surf](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/type/beach-ocean), or on a [mountaintop](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/type/mountain), or in a soaring redwood [forest](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/view/forest-woods), then your perfect all-in-one venue options will be more limited—and maybe even more costly. In this case, booking two different event venues may involve a bit more effort, but sometimes it's the only way to get _exactly_ what you want.

**So...should you commit to one wedding venue for both your ceremony and reception, or do you book two?** There are pros and cons to each, my friend, so consider the information below and then choose which option is best for you.

## There are several perks of hosting your wedding ceremony and reception in the same place:

  * **One-stop shopping.** Booking one location (with one venue manager!) for your entire event versus trying to orchestrate things at two separate venues streamlines so many aspects of your big day.
  * **Shorter commute.** You don't have to worry about the logistics (and extra expense) of transporting everyone from the ceremony site to the party. And your guests don't have to worry about finding parking spots at multiple venues!
  * **Seamless cocktail hour.** There's no awkward gap between saying "I do" and getting yo' cocktails on! And you can relax knowing your nearest and dearest are happily nibbling on apps while you're posing for newlywed pix.
  * **Upcycled décor.** It's way easier to repurpose décor when your ceremony and reception spaces are at the same place. For example, your ceremony arch can double as the background of your sweetheart table!
  * **Better attendance.** With just one location, guests who may have a problem attending a ceremony and reception at two different venues won't have to choose between them.

While same-venue weddings have become the norm, you may have good reasons for mixing things up. (And for couples with a strong spiritual background, having a ceremony at a place of worship may be non-negotiable!)

  


## Here are some tips in case you DO opt for separate ceremony and reception locations:

  * **Make travel time short.** In deference to your guests, keep travel time between the ceremony and reception sites to 30 minutes or less—and definitely no more than an hour. Take local traffic trends (and the weather forecast!) into consideration.
  * **Show guests the way.** Be sure to provide accurate maps for BOTH locations (either with the invites or on your wedding website).
  * **Mind the gap.** If there's a large chunk of time between the ceremony and reception, give your guests the heads up well in advance so they can plan accordingly. List some nearby activities on an invitation insert or on your wedding website where guests can have fun while killing time until the reception starts. And try your best to keep the gap between 60–90 minutes, max.
  * **Avoid parking hassles.** Some landmark or off-the-beaten path locations have very limited parking, and possibly even challenging roadways. Organize designated parking areas with the venue managers in advance—or if it's in the budget, book a shuttle service! 
  * **Don't flip out.** While having separate venues does away with the need to "flip" the room, you may still have to schlep your floral arrangements, makeup bag, extra paper goods, or other items from the ceremony to your second destination. Make a list of all the essential things you'll need to transport, and ask your Maid of Honor or a trusted family member to take charge of getting them to the reception.
