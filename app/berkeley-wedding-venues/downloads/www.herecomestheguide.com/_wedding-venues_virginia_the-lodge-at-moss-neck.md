  * **Blending rustic romance and modern luxury, this stunning estate** feels like your own private escape, set amid wooded groves, golden meadows, and gracious lawns. The post-and-beam Lodge exemplifies this distinctive charm, boasting locally sourced cedar, black walnut, and cherry wood construction and artisan-designed interiors and furnishings.
  * **Celebrate in the fresh country air on the two-level outdoor space,** where you’ll find plenty of room for cocktails and lawn games as well as a beautiful Tented Pavilion with sweeping views of the pastoral landscape. You can say “I do” here too, or explore the sprawling property to find your own perfect spot.
  * **Weekend weddings are especially lovely here:** You’ll enjoy exclusive use of the property, along with overnight accommodations in 15 cozy rooms, personalized farm-to-table menus, a full-service spa, and access to tons of on-site activities, ranging from carriage rides to skeet shooting to indoor archery to lounging by the pool.
