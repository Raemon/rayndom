## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Twenty acres of unspoiled rural beauty** **form the heart of this peaceful central Maine refuge.** And with its historic buildings, orchard, open fields, and perennial gardens, it’s a photographer’s dream spot, too. 
  * **A woodland clearing with a chic round arbor****hosts your outdoor ceremony,** where guests look on from hand-made benches. Shift to the pergola for cocktails around the fire, and then to the beautiful 200-year-old barn (affectionately known as “Gloria”) for a rustic-elegant reception. 
  * **There are so many sweet, thoughtful details** that help make your event a stylish success, like the darling vintage truck fountain over the pond, the quaint bridge, and a “pay it forward” attic of décor you’re welcome to borrow.
