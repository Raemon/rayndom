## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched at the edge of the cerulean Pacific just across the bay from San Diego's sparking skyline,** this historic venue and restaurant boasts some of the very best views in town. It's also got some of the very best food: the master culinary team will work closely with you to craft a custom menu to match your budget and tastes, with a focus on fresh, creative seafood dishes.
  * **The waterfront ceremony site is highlighted by a dramatic sculptural "arch,"** designed and crafted by local artist Christoper Puzio. This unique piece frames your vows perfectly against the dramatic sea-and-city backdrop, embracing the showstopping vistas while ensuring you're always center stage.
  * **Expansive windows in the California and Harbor Rooms frame unforgettable panoramas** of the Bay and the sprawling cityscape. Adjacent private patios, perched above the turquoise water, offer a lovely spot for your guests to enjoy a cool breeze (and a cool beverage).
