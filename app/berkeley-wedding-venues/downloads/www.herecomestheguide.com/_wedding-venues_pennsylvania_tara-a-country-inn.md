  * **This 1850s Greek Revival mansion sits at the heart of beautiful Mercer County,** and is an easy drive from Pittsburgh and its suburbs. It's surrounded by lush gardens and boasts the timeless feel of a classic Southern estate. 
  * **Exchange vows in the garden or beneath the sweet gazebo,** followed by cocktails around the pool and a reception in the elegant Shiloh Banquet Room or the warm, inviting Old South Armory. 
  * **This Civil War-era mansion has been lovingly renovated** to offer couples old-world charm with modern touches such as 27 luxe, romantic guest rooms that feature gas fireplaces and jetted tubs.
