## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s an exquisite mountain location.** Tucked inside pristine Boulder Canyon, this pretty oasis has a large outdoor area surrounded by evergreens. Your ceremony can be held here, with the sounds of the babbling creek in the background.
  * **Receptions are hosted indoors or out.** A large, breezy tent pavilion lets you celebrate in the open air, and space heaters may be added in the cooler months. The historic Flagstaff Room is equally lovely, with its rustic, European lodge feel and wraparound windows.
  * **Packages are completely customizable.** You can choose one with just the basics, or opt for extras like chocolate-covered strawberries, officiant services and upgraded lighting. 
  * While Boulder Creek is a secluded location,**** it has **g****reat access to local rideshares, hotels and nightlife** in Downtown Boulder!
