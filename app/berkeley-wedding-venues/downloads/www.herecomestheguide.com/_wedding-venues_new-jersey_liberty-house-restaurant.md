### Things that make Liberty House a wedding hotspot:

**• A “view with a room” concept.** Liberty House’s 14,000-square-foot restaurant and catering facility is surrounded by water on three sides, providing breathtaking views of Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty and the iconic Manhattan skyline. 

**• Indoor and outdoor event spaces.** The Liberty Room on the first floor opens onto beautifully landscaped gardens, patios, and two tented pavilions with fire pits and cabanas for year-round use. Up on the second floor, The Grand Ballroom boasts floor-to-ceiling windows, cathedral ceilings and a wraparound terrace.

**• Attention to design and detail.** Handcrafted décor, a metro-chic feel, inviting seating areas, custom-designed wedding cakes and event stylists are all part of what makes Liberty House truly special.

**• Award-winning cuisine.** Cocktail hour options include gourmet passed hors d’oeuvres, carving and pasta stations, and handcrafted sushi along with signature cocktails, while customizable reception menus feature a wide range of tantalizing selections.
