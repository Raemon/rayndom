## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **From its jacaranda-studded perch above the valley, this chic golf course** boasts exceptionally beautiful views of the surrounding landscape—on a clear day, the San Gabriel Mountains will pop up bold and high along the horizon. In addition to the beauty outside its borders, the verdant vista boasts ample trees, lush foliage, and manicured fairways.
  * **The inviting, private banquet room is lined with a row of tall windows** to flood the space with crystalline northern light and frame views out past the adjacent patio to the action of the 10th and 18th holes. Overhead, gorgeous chandeliers hang from the vaulted, wood-beamed ceiling; the overall effect adds an elegant contrast to the room's rustic tone.
  * **A charming gazebo sets the stage for a classic ceremony,** but the gracious lawn is also flexible enough to accommodate any vision you have: create your own focal point with a _chuppah_ or other type of arch, or explore spiral or stadium-style seating. Post-nuptial photo ops abound—be sure to take a golf cart ride up to a scenic overlook with a fantastic view of Mountain Meadows.
