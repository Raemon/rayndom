## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Right in the heart of charming Weaverville**(and just a few minutes from Asheville), you’ll find this wonderful gathering space. Inspired by the town’s original meeting hall, it’s been purpose-built to include everything necessary for perfect celebrations. 
  * **Tranquil Japanese gardens** provide an unbelievably gorgeous setting for your ceremony. In the spacious, light-filled hall, a vaulted, timber-framed ceiling creates a rustic, cathedral-like effect, and the open floor plan means there’s lots of space for dinner and dancing. 
  * **A covered side deck and attached terrace** allow the party to flow outside, and a fully equipped kitchen will keep your caterers happy. There’s also a posh dressing suite, outfitted with cozy lounge seating and tons of natural light.
