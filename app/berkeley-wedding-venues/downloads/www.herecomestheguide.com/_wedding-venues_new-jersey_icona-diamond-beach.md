## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located on one of the only private beaches in New Jersey,** this full-service resort sits on the quiet, less-touristy side of town and has a peaceful vibe that encourages guests to slow down and enjoy that coveted coastal lifestyle.
  * **Ceremonies may be held right on the sand,** followed by a beachside reception in the Grand Tent or Pavilion, where you can enjoy protection from the weather without blocking the view. We also love the third-floor Ocean View Ballroom, with its built-in marble bar, modern chandeliers, and three walls of glass doors that open onto a wraparound patio with spectacular views of Diamond Beach and the Atlantic.
  * **Your guests will love their overnight options—** a range of suites and studios boast fun features like private balconies, well-appointed kitchens, and luxuriously soothing bath areas.
