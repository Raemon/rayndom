##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **Exchange vows on the oceanfront lawn, framed by soaring palms and set against the peaks of the Kauai Mountain Range,** or opt for an intimate ceremony after sunset, surrounded by glowing lanterns and the sound of the sea. The open-air ballroom is just steps away, and offers the same spectacular ocean view. 
  * **The event specialists exude the Aloha spirit.** With plenty of experience in managing destination weddings and a passion for sharing Hawaiian culture and flavor, their warm guidance and attention to detail will keep you stress-free throughout the process.
  * **Your wedding offers an unforgettable ocean getaway for your guests.** From lounging beside the zero-edge infinity pool to hiking the nearby Wailua River State Park, to experiencing an authentic luau right on site, this is the perfect home base for a Hawaiian adventure.
