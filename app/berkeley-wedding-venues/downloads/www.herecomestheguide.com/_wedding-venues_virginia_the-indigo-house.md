## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Host the backyard wedding of your dreams, with the gift of time to truly enjoy it.** This airy bed & breakfast boasts thoughtfully curated, nature-forward design, lush grounds with sweeping mountain views, and an ideal location in the heart of Virginia’s craft beer, wine, and artisan community. Full property buyouts ensure you can soak up every moment with your loved ones (including the furry ones!) and build something beautiful together.
  * **Whether you wed in the late afternoon sunlight** streaming through the trees of Little Sequoia—the property’s woodland gathering space—or in the sweeping, breezy meadow, with its panorama of gently sloping mountains, your ceremony is a guaranteed showstopper.
  * **Gather on the side lawn to celebrate surrounded by native plants and herbs** (there’s ample room for a tent, if you wish), or step into the stonewall courtyard, which is set with comfy lounge furniture, a fire pit, and festive bistro lighting.
