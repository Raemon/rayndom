## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This historic Spanish-Colonial architectural landmark** has played host to spectacular celebrations for over 100 years. Located on over 2 picturesque acres just a block from Mission Santa Barbara, this beloved venue thoughtfully showcases the area's natural beauty... and provides plenty of flexibility for shaping your day as you dream it.
  * **Ceremonies are held on the stone-walled Terrace** beneath the shady arms of a spreading oak. After the "I do"s, continue the party al fresco, mingling among gracious gardens studded with fountains and bloom-lined paths as the draped bistro lights and vintage-inspired street lamps begin to glow. 
  * **Rows of gently arched patio doors lead into the handsome ballroom,** where you'll find rich wood beams, wrought-iron railings, and crisp white stucco walls create an airy, expansive feel. Greet your guests from the pretty mezzanine before joining them for a spin on the gleaming oak floors.
