## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Warm, intimate romance abounds at this charming Italian restaurant,** tucked into a vintage brick building in the heart of Fairmount. There are multiple beautiful event spaces to spark your vision, including the cozy Wine Room, which overlooks the award-winning wine cellar, the Kitchen Table, perfect for elopements, the stylish Main Dining Room, and the Greenhouse—or opt for a full restaurant buyout and let your celebration flow between them. 
  * **Light floods the iconic, glass-enclosed Greenhouse****during the day,** illuminating the lush hanging greenery, stone floors, and whitewashed brick walls and creating a vibrant, airy backdrop for your vows. Enjoy al fresco cocktails on the Pergola before returning inside for dinner, where the Greenhouse is transformed after dark into a magical, twinkle-lit oasis perfect for convivial dining.
  * **Fresh, seasonal menus are crafted just for you** by the talented team who made this one of the nation’s most critically acclaimed Italian restaurants. With a wood-burning grill and custom-made brick oven, traditional Northern Italian techniques are paired with a refreshingly modern vision to create menus that will delight every palate.
