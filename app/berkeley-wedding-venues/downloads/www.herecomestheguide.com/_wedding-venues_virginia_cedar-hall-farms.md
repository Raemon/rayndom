## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's a family-run working horse farm in a beautiful section of Virginia Beach** , with rolling pastures, gorgeous valley views, and some truly adorable residents—the pretty, sweet-natured Mystic Ponies.
  * **After your peaceful meadow ceremony, you'll move to the massive indoor arena** , which features a soaring ceiling, tons of light flowing in through the skylights and sliding doors on each end, and loads of room for dancing.
  * **A cute lounge area off the barn serves as your day-of prep area.** There's plenty of seating for everyone in your wedding party, and the farm-themed décor lends the space a cozy, homey feel.
