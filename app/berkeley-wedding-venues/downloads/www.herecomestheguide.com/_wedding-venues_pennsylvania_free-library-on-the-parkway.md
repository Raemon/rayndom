## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **With its impressive Beaux Arts architecture,** this historic building is a tru Philly icon, and home of the city's beloved Free Library. Sitting at the heart of scenic Benjamin Franklin Parkway, it offers a convenient, central location, and multiple indoor and outdoor celebration options.
  * **The Main Lobby boasts a soaring, ornately coffered ceiling,** patterned marble floor, and walls embellished with dramatic Romanesque pillars. Add the Second Floor Landing for an unforgettable cocktail hour overlooking the lobby below.
  * **Warm-weather events can take advantage of the Skyline Terrace,** a rooftop space that features breathtaking views of Shakespeare Park, Logan Circle, and the glittering cityscape. The adjacent, newly remodeled Skyline Room has a bright, modern feel, and can be rented in conjunction with the terrace.
