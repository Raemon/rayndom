## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Arrive by private snowcat for your winter wedding** at this quaint, historic log cabin, where you'll look out across endless mountain views from beneath groves of towering aspen trees.
  * **In the summer, you can take advantage of the flower-filled meadow** , where there's plenty of room for both your ceremony and tented reception, or allow the celebration to flow between the cabin and the spacious outdoor patio.
  * **There are enough great activities to fill a wedding weekend**... and then some! The Cabin is part of Aspen Snowmass resort, whose four year-round mountain playgrounds boast skiing, tubing, hiking, nightlife, and more.
