## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Encompassing grassy meadows, a burbling stream, and groves of ancient oaks,** this beloved 40-acre park provides a picturesque backdrop for celebrations of all kinds. With affordable rental prices, versatile spaces, and plenty of flexibility, the options for customization are truly endless.
  * **The pretty, Victorian-inspired gazebo is a favorite for ceremonies,** with its delicate spindles railings, ornate decorative braces, and a louvered cupola creating a vintage feel. A curved path serves as an aisle, leading through the shady trees and up the lawn, where your guests can admire the procession.
  * **After the "I do"s, join your photographer for pictures on the expansive grounds** before joining your loved ones in the spacious reception area for dinner and dancing. The open-air pavilion's warm, wood-framed structure is beautiful on its own, but it's easily transformed to match various styles and themes, from rustic to boho to modern.
