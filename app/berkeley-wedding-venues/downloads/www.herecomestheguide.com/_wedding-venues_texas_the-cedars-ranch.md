## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Twenty private acres dotted with oak and cedar are yours for the day** at this sweet, secluded venue, which offers a gracious, peaceful vibe, just 45 minutes southwest of Austin!
  * **We adore the Event Hall,** with its whitewashed, staggered-slat siding and cool indoor/outdoor feel… it's a unique modern twist on traditional Texas favorite. The cute event lounge is the perfect spot for your cocktail hour, complete with a rustic indoor area, open courtyard, bistro lighting, and plenty of tables and chairs you can arrange to your liking.
  * **Celebrate all weekend long with exclusive access to all the fun, resort-like amenities** , like a sparkling pool, a poolside bar, pickleball courts, and hiking trails. Accommodations in cool yurts, geodomes, and light-flooded cabins for up to 100 guests—and fabulous discounts on lodging for full weekend buyouts—make this spot perfect for a Texas-chic destination wedding.
