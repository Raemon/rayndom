## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled along a peaceful, quarter-mile sweep of sun-kissed****Kalapaki****Beach,** this island oasis is a spectacular option for destination weddings on the Garden Isle. Their package offerings are generous and customizable—you might opt for a simple elopement, a grand week-long all-inclusive soiree, or simply work with their experienced planners to discover the right fit for you. 
  * **The verdant Luau Grounds lawn unfurls to meet the soft sands and shimmering waters** of the beach, creating a spectacular setting for iconic oceanfront ceremonies, toes-in-the-water photos, and sunset receptions illuminated by tiki torches. Or, celebrate amid the gardens in Puna Court, a columned open-air Pavilion surrounded by fragrant native flowers, lush palms, and burbling water features.
  * **Experience the staff's dedication to thoughtful service before you even step onto the property:** a complimentary shuttle will pick you and your loved ones up at the airport to whisk them away in style. During your stay, indulge in the ample amenities on site: host a welcome dinner at their landmark restaurant, Duke's Kauai, primp and prep at the elegant day spa, and sip a refreshing cocktail beside Hawaii's largest one-level pool.
