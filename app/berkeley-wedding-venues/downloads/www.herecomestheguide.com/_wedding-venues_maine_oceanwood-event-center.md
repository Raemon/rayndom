## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled on 120 acres that spans from fragrant pine forests to the rugged Atlantic coast,** this dreamy Maine retreat**** is hidden away off a picturesque country road, just minutes from the Schoodic Peninsula of Acadia National Park. It’s an incredibly peaceful place, with gracious owners who have thought of everything and can’t wait to share this gorgeous spot with you.
  * **The spacious barn has the warmth of a classic post-and-beam charmer** with the modern amenities of a topnotch event space. Two sets of doors slide open to reveal a curvilinear flagstone patio with a stone fire ring, allowing the party to flow in and out with ease. You’ll have your choice of al fresco ceremony sites, too: exchange vows on the patio, before a quaint gazebo and peaceful pond, or among the trees in an oceanfront pine grove.
  * **The property is yours all weekend long, from Friday to Monday, so there’s no need to rush.** Plush lodging is available in the pretty dressing suite, or invite your guests to bring their RVs or tents and take advantage of the oceanfront campground. There’s nothing like drifting to sleep to the sound of splashing waves and waking up to the fresh breeze as it wafts off the sea.
