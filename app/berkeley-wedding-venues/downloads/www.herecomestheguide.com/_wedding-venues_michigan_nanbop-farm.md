## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Acres of rolling meadows, lush woodlands, and fields of wildflowers** create the perfect Northern Michigan countryside escape at this family-run biodynamic farm, which is named for the owner’s parents, who were lovingly nicknamed “Nana” and “Boppy”.
  * **An open field with sweet rural views is your romantic ceremony spot,** and for your reception, there’s a massive tent that seats up to 225 guests; its clear top means you won’t miss a second of the starry night skies. 
  * **Touches like handcrafted farm tables and cross-backed wooden chairs** bring rustic charm, and your band or DJ can be easily accommodated. The staff is happy to share their list of trusted local pros who are familiar with events at the farm, but you’re also welcome to use your favorite licensed vendor, if you like.
