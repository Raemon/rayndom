## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Laden with classic New Orleans charm,** this 100 year-old mansion—given new life as a welcoming B&B—sits in the heart of mid-city, with the iconic Canal Streetcar running just outside. It offers guests an authentic taste of the French Quarter, with thoughtful modern touches that enhance the Inn’s historic character.
  * **The colorful manicured gardens** **are a truly romantic spot for ceremonies,** and there’s plenty of space to dine and dance beneath the shade trees or pretty white pergola. Intimate reception dinners are simply perfect in the elegant formal dining room, with its delicate stained glass windows and fireplace topped by a stately carved wood mantle. 
  * **From micro-weddings and elopements to grand affairs,** there’s a package to meet your needs. There are even options that include full rental of the Inn’s eleven inviting guest rooms, allowing you to create an unforgettable destination weekend.
