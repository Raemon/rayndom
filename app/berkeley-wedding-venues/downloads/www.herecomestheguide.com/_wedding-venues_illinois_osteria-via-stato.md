## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This Italian tavern transforms into a warm, rustic-yet-elegant wedding venue,** with arched entryways, tiled floors and wood-beamed ceilings. You can have your ceremony here, too! 
  * **Menus, which can be customized, are inspired by Chef David DiGregorio’s Italian heritage,** family recipes, and his many travels. All dishes use local and seasonal ingredients. Your guests will be able to choose their dinner entrée, at the table, on the day of the event. 
  * **Restaurant staff will help match you up with the ideal vendors to fit your vibe:** florals, wedding cake designer, musical entertainment, or any other services you may need so that your party will turn out just the way you imagined it.
