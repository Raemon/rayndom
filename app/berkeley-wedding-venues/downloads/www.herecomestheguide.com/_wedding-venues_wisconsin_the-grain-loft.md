## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Fifteen acres of beautifully manicured grounds** and charming, cottage-style buildings create endless celebration opportunities at this lush, private venue. And its location, just across the road from the shores of Lake Michigan, brings the possibility for even more cool photos. 
  * **Start the day in a comfy, light-filled dressing suite** before meandering to your gorgeous ceremony space: a unique platform at the center of a wraparound creek bed, whose ferns, mossy rocks, and lush foliage feel like a hidden forest escape. 
  * **The stylish design of the two-story loft blends industrial, modern, and rustic elements** for a wholly special reception experience, with chic touches like a soaring vaulted ceiling, exposed barn wood beams and ductwork, and dramatic floor-to-ceiling windows.
