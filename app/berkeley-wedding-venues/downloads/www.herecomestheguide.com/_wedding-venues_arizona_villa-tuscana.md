## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This lovely space was purpose-built** with fantastic celebrations in mind. Truly a “one stop shop”, it’s been outfitted with all the essential amenities, plus tons of thoughtful extras and a top-notch staff to help bring it all together.
  * **Take advantage of Mesa’s year-round gorgeous weather** with an outdoor ceremony in the courtyard, where you’ll exchange vows beneath a cherrywood pergola and a backdrop of soaring palms.
  * **In the elegant reception hall, you’ll find romantic lighting** courtesy of delicate wall scones and gilded chandeliers with teardrop crystals. A creamy, neutral color palette ensures cohesion with any chosen décor.
