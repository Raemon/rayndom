## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The historic Danada House is a 19-room, white brick country estate home** that dates back to 1939. Situated in the midst of the Danada Forest Reserve, it's perfect for your outdoor ceremony, with its carefully manicured lawn, brick walkways, and bubbling fountains.
  * **The all-season atrium at the back of the house has three walls of windows** , giving you and your guests a terrific view of the wooded grounds during your indoor ceremony or reception. And amenities like the wooden dance floor, state-of-the-art lighting system, WiFi, and climate control make it a thoroughly accommodating space any time of the year.
  * **Arranging for local lodging and vendors is easy:** Danada House will provide a list of nearby hotels for your out-of-town guests, as well as a selection of approved caterers you can rely on to help make your event a success.
