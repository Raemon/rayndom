## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Alpine magic awaits at this stunning resort** spread across four breathtaking locations encompassing thirteen unique venues. From intimate mountain-top elopements to grand al fresco gatherings to luxurious lodge soirees, the dramatic high-country backdrop and fresh mountain air take celebrations at this iconic ski destination to the next level.
  * **Diverse venue options at each site let you design your perfect day.** You might whisk your guests up a chairlift for a ceremony at the summit or say “I do” on a slopeside deck with panoramic views; dine in a modern lodge with apres-ski vibes or on an intimate patio surrounded by towering pines; or keep it simple and host the whole event in a serene, sunkissed meadow at the mountain’s base.
  * **All-inclusive packages and resort amenities** take the guesswork out of planning, with tiered options to fit your budget and vision, design-your-own menus with cool enhancements, and additional services like tent rentals for weather protection. The planning process is eased by the resort's experienced wedding coordinators, who will take you through the timeline every step of the way.
