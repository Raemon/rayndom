## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located on 5th Avenue, it exudes Manhattan elegance** with an intimate touch. The 360-degree, wraparound Rooftop Terrace makes an incredible ceremony site, with its retractable roof, landscaped garden, and rich mahogany decking. Say “I do” against the backdrop of the iconic Empire State Building and the famous Marble Collegiate Church, as well as other stunning Manhattan skyline views. 
  * **Dinner and dancing unfold in the expansive loft below.** It boasts a polished oak floor, high ceiling, and windows all around that frame the gorgeous city views. This space is easily transformed with glowing chandeliers, the warmth of candles, tall centerpieces, or a dance floor.
  * **Their in-house production company can bring your vision to life.** _Midtown Loft Productions_ offers uplighting, ceiling draping, a variety of chandeliers, an illuminated sky bar, and more!
