## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A Costa Mesa hidden gem, this luxury event venue boasts glamorous, versatile celebration spaces with perfect indoor-outdoor flow.** Couples share their wedding vows in the Mediterranean-inspired olive grove, and then pose for photos around the property, including in the lovely garden. Meanwhile, guests mingle and sip cocktails in their own private garden courtyard, strung with bistro lights. 
  * **Doors slide open to admit dinner guests to the skylit atrium reception hall, with a dramatic, airy aesthetic that can be styled romantic-elegant or modern-edgy**(why not lean into that industrial chic vibe?) Spacious and refined, there’s plenty of room for lounge areas, full-service bars and a dance floor. 
  * **Make yourselves at home in the two unique get-ready rooms:** A sophisticated Library Lounge with moody dark walls and leather furnishings; and the light-filled Sunroom, complete with garden view. Customizable all-inclusive wedding packages + Wedgewood Weddings' legendary service will put the _“Ahhh”_ in the OC!
