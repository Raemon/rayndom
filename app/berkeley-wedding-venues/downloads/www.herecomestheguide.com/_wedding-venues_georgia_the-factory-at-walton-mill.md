## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This industrial-chic converted warehouse has a cool history** (it was formerly used for spinning and weaving cotton into cloth), and has been thoughtfully restored to its rightful place at the heart of downtown Monroe.
  * **In the Hawthorne Room, you'll find massive wood beams** , a rich hardwood floor, and a wonderful timber-framed Gathering Porch. Photo ops abound, from beautiful gardens and paved patios to unique features like a water tower and original smokestack.
  * **The packages are truly all-inclusive, and fully customizable.** Mix and match from their flexible offerings—which include delectable catering options, a topnotch DJ, and exquisite floral & décor design—to craft your perfect day.
