## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched on a 70-acre peninsula along the shores of Rest Lake,** this historic camp is in the heart of the Northwoods, surrounded by the dense, towering woodlands of Northern Highlands State Forest. It’s operated by the YMCA, and your rental fees help support their year-round outdoor educational programming. 
  * **The amphitheater is the dreamiest spot for open-air vows,** with its towering pines framing a tranquil lake scene; ample tiered guest seating ensures everyone can see the view. Follow with a reception on the spacious grounds, or in the quaint, rustic dining hall, with its romantic stone fireplace. 
  * **On-site accommodation is available for even the largest of groups,** and included at various levels with your packages. Options include lodges, cabins for groups and couples, and a fun “yurt village.” Warm-season guests have access to the camp’s canoes and kayaks for extra fun on the water.
