## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This 1913 Long Beach landmark, designed by famed architect Elmer Gray** —the mind behind the iconic Beverly Hills Hotel and the reason for "Elm" in this venue's name—was once showcased in leading architectural journals as a dramatic exemplar of the grandeur and richness of the era. With diverse event spaces, a flexible all-inclusive approach, and the privacy of an exclusive rental, the sky's the limit for your spectacular celebration.
  * **On the second floor you'll find** **a luxurious grand ballroom** accented by breathtaking 30-foot coffered ceilings and soaring windows that flood the space with light. We also love the industrial-chic Parlor, studded with columns and boasting original brick detailing, for a charming cocktail hour.
  * **The in-house professionals from renowned Bite Catering Couture** are experts in designing fabulous menus and thoughtfully imagined, beautifully presented events. Creativity and customization is welcomed here; craft your own personalized vision supported by the detail-focused team, innovative high-end vendor partners, and spectacular spaces.
