## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You get private access to the entire estate.** Exclusive use of the property means you can make the most of the elegant main building and carriage house, as well as ponds, gazebos, bridges, and quaint garden spaces. And unlike many venues, you can stay past midnight if you wish.
  * **There are two great dressing suites, each fully equipped for wedding party prep.** One boasts a hair and makeup room with lots of natural light, along with a pretty porch; the other comes equipped with a pool table and ample comfy seating.
  * **Day-of coordination is included.** In addition to the staff helping you plan details and find vendors (Gray Gables works with some of the best in the area), you’ll receive the services of an experienced wedding professional on the wedding day itself.
