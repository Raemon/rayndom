## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

Hidden among the Simi Valley foothills on 8 acres, The Vineyards is a lavish special event oasis that includes almost every romantic element you can imagine: sunsets and starlight, grapevines and gardens, waterfalls and whimsical fountains, as well as glamorous interiors that make you feel like movie stars. Yet perhaps the venue’s most standout attribute is their service-oriented banquet managers, who thoughtfully orchestrate each phase of your celebration, right from your guests’ arrival at the main center’s waterfall entryway.

The friendly staff (and the personalized signage) directs them to either a rustic or contemporary ceremony site, depending on your preference. A stroll to the former follows a serpentine garden path shaded by twinkle-lit, vine-covered arbors down a hillside to a forested dell. As fragrant blooms perfume the air, you exchange vows in front of a profusion of lush greenery and willowy trees. The namesake vineyards are spread out below the garden, and newlyweds are often photographed holding hands among the grapevines.

For a different yet equally invigorating experience, wed on the Waterfall Terrace atop a stunning stone stage framed by a redwood pergola, to the hypnotic accompaniment of rushing water. Behind you, water spills over two landscaped stone tiers that flank the stage steps where your wedding party holds court. Your loved ones enjoy this refreshing tableau, seated beneath café lights and portable white-wood pergolas fashioned with adjustable canopies and sheer drapes—an innovation that’s both practical and pretty.

Several enchanting patios encircle the main building, each lending its own charms to al fresco gatherings (think fire tables, custom-built fountains, a fetching footbridge and more!) Or bring the social hour inside to the ultra-swanky Mountain View Room, whose décor epitomizes unique chic. Outfitted in the venue’s signature creamy white (always in style, darling), the bi-level room dazzles with crystal chandeliers, luminarias and sparkly accents. On the upper level, silver banquettes dressed with retro fur pillows are the perfect spot to admire breathtaking wraparound windows that double as transparent water walls, a clever design that elevates the space’s hip factor.

Elegant galas are sure to impress in the neighboring Grandview Room, which boasts a similar aesthetic—taken up a notch. Chiffon ceiling canopies entwined with rope lights showcase dining tables and gold Chiavari chairs. A built-in stage stands ready for your entertainment, and theatrical lighting delivers a range of color enhancements that add dramatic flair to your reception.

The venue’s most novel space is the rotunda-shaped Star View Room, centered around a circular copper bar ringed with trendy acrylic stools. Overhead, an elaborate chandelier hangs from a soaring coved ceiling that displays a scintillating faux starscape. With its nightclub attitude and intimate white leather-clad enclaves, the Star View’s mood is at once sultry and cool, just the thing for cocktails, an after-party or an out-of-the-ordinary rehearsal dinner.

If it’s all a bit dizzying, don’t worry. The Vineyards’ seasoned event pros will skillfully integrate your vision with their value-filled packages. Versatile, original and accommodating, this is definitely one of those places you have to experience to fully appreciate, so be sure it’s on your "must see" list. You won’t be disappointed.
