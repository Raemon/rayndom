## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Panoramic fairway views, a vaulted ceiling, and three private balconies** (very romantic!) are just a few of the features that make the third-story ballroom such a lovely place for receptions. And since they allow only one wedding per evening, the focus will be exclusively on you and your guests.
  * **The setting is picture-perfect for an outdoor ceremony** , where you'll exchange vows in a private area bordered by vibrant flowers and pines. Afterwards, take advantage of the great photo opportunities on the rolling fairways, which are studded with trees and sparkling ponds with fountains. 
  * **Gourmet on-site catering gives you an elegant culinary experience** from start to finish, with upgrades such as butler-passed signature cocktails and mouth-watering dessert stations—including filled-to-order cannolis and chocolate-dipped monogrammed treats—to round out your event.
