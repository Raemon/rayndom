## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **From its scenic cove location far from the busier parts of the island, this coastal retreat is a remarkable historic property** (one of the first in this region of Maui) that exudes the nostalgic charm of Old Hawai'i.
  * **Designed with intimate gatherings in mind, ceremonies take place on an expansive lawn just steps from a sandy beach,** with exquisite panoramas of the sparkling blue ocean spread out between palm trees.
  * **A stylish, fully furnished house with a laid-back, beachy vibe is great for getting ready,** and the spacious front porch can host musicians. The experienced White Orchid Weddings team offers full-service event coordination, and will help you pull together the best of the local vendors to make your occasion extraordinary.
