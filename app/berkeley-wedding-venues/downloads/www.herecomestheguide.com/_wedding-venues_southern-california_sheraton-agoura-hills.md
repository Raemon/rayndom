## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set at the base of the Santa Monica Mountains,** this full-service hotel is perfectly placed for both locals and out-of-town guests, offering easy access to El Matador State Beach, Pepperdine University, and Westlake Village, with nearby trails, wineries, and breweries adding to the weekend vibe.
  * **Thirteen modern event spaces can accommodate weddings of all sizes and styles,** all cleverly tucked away from the main guest areas of the hotel for plenty of privacy. The Upper Terrace is a stunning spot for an al fresco ceremony, with sweeping views of the surrounding landscape; cocktails might follow on the pool deck or in a window-lined foyer, followed by receptions in one of the elegant ballrooms.
  * **Overnight guests will find plenty of perks to staying on-site,** from the spacious rooms and outdoor pool to the welcoming Lobby, which is perfect for mingling with loved ones. Affordable packages can be scaled to meet any budget, with diverse options for cultural celebrations and Kosher catering.
