## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The ballroom is lovely, and overlooks the beautiful golf course.** This pretty room features a peaked ceiling hung with elegant chandeliers, and walls lined with huge windows that let in the light and views. 
  * **The grounds are perfect for photos or outdoor ceremonies.** The gazebos, water features, and manicured landscaping are all surrounded by acres of woodland. The vistas change with the seasons, and are gorgeous any time of year.
  * **Catering is provided by a seasoned professional.** _Anthony’s Catering_ runs a collection of restaurants and venues in the Philadelphia area, and has years of experience putting on successful events. Banquet menus are creative, customizable, and (of course!) delicious.
