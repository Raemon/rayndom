## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This landmark venue at the edge of Central Park feels like a love letter to old New York,** with hand-carved stonework and a stately façade that’s pure turn-of-the-century romance.**** Plus, you’re just a short stroll from iconic spots like Strawberry Fields**,** the Great Lawn, and the Central Park Boathouse—perfect for photo ops or a quick nature break between festivities.
  * **Inside, the neo-Gothic Sanctuary is truly extraordinary,** with dramatic interior arches, large stained-glass windows, and a striking central altar framed by gleaming organs. Here, you’ll find a thoughtful blend of historic elegance and modern amenities. For example, the soaring cathedral ceilings boast state-of-the-art sound and lighting technology to create a vibe that’s all your own.
  * **Fabulous all-inclusive services are provided by the experts at Purslane,** New York’s first carbon-neutral and zero-waste catering company. They’ll handle every detail, from full-service planning and coordination to crafting a custom menu that showcases the very best of the region’s seasonal bounty, leaving you free to soak in the experience with the ones you love most.
