## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You’ll be married on your own private island.** This extraordinary estate occupies a breathtaking spot at the water’s edge. The traditional Nantucket-style buildings blend elegant sophistication with welcoming charm, and the surrounding dunes and wetlands provide an unparalleled atmospheric backdrop. 
  * **The Boathouse Chapel is a rustic treasure.** Transported piece by piece from New England and lovingly restored, this timber-framed beauty features barn-style doors on three sides that swing wide open to let in the breeze and the views. The huge, river-stone fireplace is the Chapel’s heart, and a perfectly romantic place to say “I do”.
  * **You can rent the entire estate for the weekend.** Ensure a lifetime of memories when you turn your wedding into a two-day affair. After your celebration in the opulent ballroom—and perhaps an after-party in the Great Room—pamper your dearest guests (and yourself!) with accommodations in one of the twelve private suites, which feature fireplaces, balconies, and Jacuzzi tubs.
