## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This 60-acre lakeside retreat and equestrian farm** offers a true escape from everyday life, with Scandinavian-inspired cabins tucked into old-growth forest 70 feet above Perry Lake. Elopements are especially lovely here, with generous packages that feature overnight lodging, a mini cake and florals, and photography.
  * **Say “I do” in a magical wooded amphitheater** surrounded by towering trees, as your guests look on from gleaming, custom-built wooden benches. Intimate receptions are held in the The Pony Up loft, a cozy, cathedral-ceilinged space above the stables, while larger celebrations can spill out onto Clover Lawn under the stars with the resident horses as a gentle backdrop.
  * **Opt for a true destination weekend experience with a farm buyout** , inviting your guests to join you in this woodsy wonderland for the weekend. The thoughtfully designed accommodations feature floor-to-ceiling windows, private hot tubs, and immersive forest views that make you feel completely surrounded by nature.
