## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked among mature forest on a beautifully landscaped property** in the western foothills of Loudon County, this breathtaking bed & breakfast combines the luxurious experience of a boutique hotel with the tranquil charm of a countryside setting.
  * **Say "I do" in a shady wooded glen,** then join your guests (including the furry ones!) to mingle amid the fragrant butterfly gardens, sculpted lawns, and flagstone patios. Receptions are held in the light-flooded Solarium or the seasonal Tent Pavilion, which both bring the loveliness of the outdoors in.
  * **Celebrate for the day, or opt to rent the estate and stay the weekend** —there's lodging for 16 in the cozy guest rooms, a sumptuous honeymoon suite for you, and plenty of time to soak in your gorgeous surroundings.
