## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Yes, it's that House of the Seven Gables** —the very home that inspired Nathaniel Hawthorne's treasured novel of the same name. When you wed here, you'll become part of this extraordinary spot's 350-year history.
  * **Host a waterfront ceremony and reception on the Seaside Lawn.** Follow your open-air vows with a celebration under an opulent tent, whose clear-sidewalls and ceiling guarantee you won't miss any of the spectacular views.
  * **Smaller affairs can be held in the charming Holyoke-Plumstock Room** , which can be divided into two separate spaces. Or, choose the cozy Hooper-Hathaway House, a delightful Colonial Revival cottage with much of its original Jacobean detailing.
