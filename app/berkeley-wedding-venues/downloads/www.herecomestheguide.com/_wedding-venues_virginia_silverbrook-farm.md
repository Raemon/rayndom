## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked in a valley between the Blue Ridge Mountains and Short Hill Mountain** , this charming venue offers beautiful countryside vistas and a perfect city escape. Plus, the generous welcome from the owner, Dotti, makes it feel like a home away from home.
  * **Your outdoor ceremony options include both formal and country gardens** , as well as peaceful forest clearings and a dreamy, intimate historic chapel with hand-hewn wooden benches. Once you've said "I do", move the celebration to the gorgeous, two-story 19th-century reception barn.
  * **A graceful stone and stucco farmhouse-turned-bed & breakfast **is your home base and cozy lodging. It boasts two dressing suites, plus a roomy kitchen, common room, an enchanting porch with rocking chairs that overlook the gracious grounds, and a garden area complete with an oversized chess set.
