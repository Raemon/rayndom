##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **A charming white gazebo, brick pathways, and lushly landscaped grounds** make a lovely backdrop for garden ceremonies. Follow the "I do"s with a reception in the opulent Grand Ballroom or the spacious Golf View Ballroom, with its adjacent covered patio and views of the 18th green.
  * **Multicultural weddings, kosher weddings, destination weddings... oh my!** With multiple event venues of various sizes, there's a venue for every special event, unique packages for religious and cultural needs are ultra-accommodating, and the impressive on-site amenities offer plenty of activities to fill a fabulous weekend-long celebration.
  * **Generous all-inclusive packages are ideal for hands-off planning,** featuring delectable catering, a custom cake, and a complimentary overnight at the nearby Marriott. Plus, they're fully customizable: add-on a glam squad from the on-site spa, a late-night party at the restaurant, a luxe rehearsal dinner... the options are endless!
