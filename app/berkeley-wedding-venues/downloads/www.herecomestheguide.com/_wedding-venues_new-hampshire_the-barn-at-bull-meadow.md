##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **This lushly wooded estate****offers stunning, unobstructed views** in every direction. Family-run, with a welcoming, secluded feel, its convenient proximity to downtown Concord means you and your guests will have ample lodging options.
  * **Speak your vows beneath a custom-built pergola** in an open meadow, then lead the way to cocktails on the patio and a reception in the gorgeous, two-story event barn, with its dramatic vaulted ceiling, flooring of hardwood and polished concrete, and stylish bar. 
  * **Packages include lots of handy extras,** like tent setup over the patio, Chiavari chairs, early access for decorating, and two awesome dressing suites (we call dibs on the one with the air hockey table!)
