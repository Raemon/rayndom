## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With serene, modern design that echoes its lovely surroundings,** this Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired venue incorporates natural materials, clean lines and large expanses of glass to both take advantage of and become part of its hilltop setting in Summitridge Park. Atop its lovely perch within the 26-acre recreation area, the Center affords sweeping vistas of tranquil gardens, hiking trails, and city lights below.
  * **The striking San Gabriel Mountains are the backdrop for ceremonies in Wedding Oval,** accessed by a long, covered walkway bordered by white iceberg roses as well as iris. Continue to drink in the panoramic views while enjoying cocktails and hors d'oeuvres on the center's wraparound patio, or head inside to mingle in the foyer. 
  * **The soaring, two-story ballroom is truly breathtaking,** with coffered ceilings and expansive windows creating an expansive feel. Organic stonework in shades of sandstone and dusky adobe adds visual drama to some of the walls, and customized zone and accent lighting allows you to control the level of light inside so that everyone can see the city sparkle in the distance.
