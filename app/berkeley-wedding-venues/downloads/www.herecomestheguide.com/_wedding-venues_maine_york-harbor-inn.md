## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Coastal New England charm reigns at this waterside inn overlooking York Harbor.** Surrounded primarily by sprawling estates, this special spot has avoided the commercial growth of larger Maine resorts, and retains the feel of tranquil escape.
  * **It’s directly across the street from beautiful Hartley Mason Reserve,** where you can hold your ceremony on a bluff above the waves. And with a host of beautifully appointed indoor venues designed to accommodate weddings both intimate and opulent, you have the option to celebrate in any season.
  * **There are sixty-five unique guest rooms within seven buildings,** so everyone on your guest list is certain to find the perfect match. All stays include daily breakfast at 1637, the Inn’s historic ocean view dining room.
