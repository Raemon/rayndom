## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Pastoral and private,** this beautiful ranch-inspired venue sits nestled in a tranquil hollow that feels worlds away from busy daily life. Fewer than 90 minutes south of Atlanta, it centers around a large pond and is surrounded by lush woodland.
  * **The massive barn** is equipped to handle events of all sizes. It boasts a soaring, open-rafter ceiling hung with bistro lights and candelabra chandeliers, and a poured concrete floor perfect for dancing.
  * **They offer well-appointed dressing suites** for both the couple, three gorgeous outdoor ceremony sites, and a wonderful covered porch perfect for a cozy cocktail hour…complete with an outdoor fireplace!
