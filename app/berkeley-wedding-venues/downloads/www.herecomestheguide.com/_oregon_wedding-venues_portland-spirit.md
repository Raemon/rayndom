## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **City sights and city lights become part of your wedding festivities** with a downtown Portland cruise on one of three fabulous yachts. The flagship _Portland Spirit_ offers ample room for a long guest list; the more intimate _Willamette Star_ and _the Crystal Dolphin_ are equally luxurious with their own unique vibes.
  * **Getting married by the captain of the ship feels as romantic** as a scene from a movie. And just as every good movie has a crackerjack crew, the staff here will help you plan (and then oversee) every detail so your event is smooth sailing from start to finish.
  * **You’ll be served a movable feast that both your eyes and palate will enjoy.** First-class dining tastes even better aboard beautifully appointed vessels with stately dining rooms and indoor and outdoor viewing decks. Their variety of ships and packages can accommodate events from a large reception to an intimate rehearsal dinner.
