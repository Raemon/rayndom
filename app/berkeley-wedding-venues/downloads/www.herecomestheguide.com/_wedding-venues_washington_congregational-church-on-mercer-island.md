## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Warm and inclusive,** this special spot—easily accessed from all points in and around Seattle—joyfully welcomes all celebrations of love, regardless of faith, race, or orientation.
  * **Your rental includes just about everything.** In addition to multiple indoor and outdoor ceremony options, you'll have access to two beautiful dressing suites for wedding party prep, a commercial kitchen, wedding day management services, free parking, and even a kids' play area! Though they provide a fabulous list of recommended vendors, you're more than welcome to bring your own.
  * **Nestled among towering shade trees and lush green ferns,** the outdoor amphitheater-style ceremony site feels like a secret treetop hideout. Inside, you’ll find a lofty gathering room with a vibe that’s both contemporary and welcoming, with a soaring ceiling, dramatic open staircase, and towering floor-to-ceiling windows that offer views of the surrounding forest.
