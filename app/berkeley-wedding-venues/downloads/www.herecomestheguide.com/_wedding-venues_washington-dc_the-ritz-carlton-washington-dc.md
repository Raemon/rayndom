## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The ceremony and reception venues are supremely elegant.** Varying shades of gold silk, lush carpets patterned with woven cherry blossoms, a de Gourney mural depicting flowering sakura trees—these are just a few of the details that adorn the ballrooms and salons, which can be configured in a variety of ways for events large and small.
  * **The hotel can arrange for some truly special additions to your wedding weekend.** Consider treating your guests to personal drivers, curated tours of the District, or a trip to a sporting event. For even more decadence, indulge in luxuries like butler-drawn baths and rose petal turn-down service.
  * **Partnering vendors are among the finest and most exclusive in the city.** While you’re welcome to use any professionals you choose for flowers, makeup, and other essentials, you’d be wise to consider the hotel’s favorites first. GreenWorks floral design, celebrity makeup artist Carl Ray, and fine atelier Carine’s Bridal are wedding industry icons, and booking your event with the Ritz gives you preferred access to their outstanding services.
