  * **Hidden away amid beautiful woodlands near the quaint town of Norway,** this romantic Maine estate’s timeless venues and picturesque grounds set the scene for a romantic Maine wedding weekend. And it’s available year-round!
  * **The custom-designed ceremony deck is so cool:** It’s slightly elevated in a grove of trees, so you feel like you’re part of the forest itself, and features built-in arches and pews. For your reception, there’s a show-stopping, two-story Carriage House, with a split staircase, dedicated bar, and intimate Edison lighting.
  * **A handsome Victorian mansion is included with your rental.** Sleeping up to ten guests across its five bedrooms, it also features a comfortable dressing suite, generously sized gathering areas, and a curated collection of art that's available for purchase, so you can bring home a forever-memory of this special property.
