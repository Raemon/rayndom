## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A boutique guest ranch set in one of northwest Montana’s most stunning areas,** this family-owned spot offers unbelievable views of the Flathead Valley and its surrounding mountains, and—our favorite part, obvs—a chance to interact with their truly beautiful Clydesdale horses. 
  * **Acres and acres of rolling meadows** means there’s plenty of space for both your ceremony and reception, with tenting an easy option in the chillier months. And coming soon: a brand-new, state-of-the-art event barn, complete with posh dual dressing suites and a charming water wheel. 
  * **Weekend-long buyouts include use of all six epic guest cabins** (complete with private patios outfitted with cedar soaking tubs, fire pits, and grills), and the staff is happy to arrange special experiences that involve the handsome resident horses, including photo ops and wagon rides.
