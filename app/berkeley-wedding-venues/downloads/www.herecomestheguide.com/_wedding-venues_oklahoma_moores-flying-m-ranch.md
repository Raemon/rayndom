## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Spanning over 700 acres of gently rolling pastures and countryside,** this family-owned ranch (which once operated a fish and exotic animal farm) boasts endless photo ops with 30 ponds, 360 degrees of lush, rural scenery, and stunning big-sky sunsets. 
  * **The two-story, 1800’s-style barn is a beauty,** with all-wood construction, exposed rafters, and traditional sliding doors that allow celebrations to flow easily between indoors and out. Romantic Edison string lighting and a built-in bar add to the space’s festive feel. 
  * **Beautiful picnic grounds offer sweeping views of the property.** They present lovely spots for ceremonies (just pick your favorite vantage point!), as well as the option for games, photos, and after-party s’mores around the fire pit.
