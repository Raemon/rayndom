## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s the prettiest resort on the shores of Lake Geneva.** Full-service amenities and ample lodging options make it a great choice for destination weddings, but its proximity to Chicago, Milwaukee, and Madison offer convenience for locals, too. 
  * **A host of beautiful indoor and outdoor venues** allow celebrations to take place in any season. Some of our faves: the historic A-frame, with its soaring window walls and elevated lounge space, the charming Harbor Gazebo overlooking the lake’s marina, and the West Shore Pavilion, an elegant, climate-controlled tent.
  * **With over three hundred rooms, suites, and two-bedroom villas,** guest accommodations are covered. Year-round activities both within the resort and throughout the popular Lake Geneva area are guaranteed to keep everyone entertained.
