  * **A remarkable hotel on the shores of Lake Mendota,** this grand Madison resort has been a beloved destination since its original construction in 1948. It’s been thoughtfully updated over the years, but retains its timeless charm.
  * **Choose between a host of indoor and outdoor celebration spaces,** including the Grand Plaza, the Veranda, and two ballrooms. Atop each of the resort's two towers, you’ll also find intimate private dining rooms with unbelievable views. 
  * **There’s ample room for everyone to stay on site,** thanks to the hotel’s generous selection of suites, most of which feature lake vistas. Pondering a bit of pre-wedding pampering? Book a day at the in-house spa…we’re dreaming of their signature service that pairs custom treatments with a tasty pint of local beer!
