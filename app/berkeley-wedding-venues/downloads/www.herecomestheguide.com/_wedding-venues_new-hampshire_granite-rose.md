## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You have a choice of two romantic outdoor ceremony sites:** The first is a rustic garden surrounded by low cut-stone walls and lush trees, where you exchange vows beneath a simple wooden pergola. An upper terrace features a fountain and a redwood gazebo shimmering with fairy lights. For a more sophisticated option, wed on a spacious manicured lawn in front of a verdigris wrought-iron gazebo, encircled by stone walls and luxuriant greenery.
  * **The glamorous ballroom showcases the beautiful scenery** through curved walls of glass French doors and windows. Elegant chandeliers and crystal pendants cast their glow from a dramatic coved ceiling that's inset with skylights. Guests dine around a polished dance floor, and a raised stage is perfect for the head table, wedding cake, or your entertainment.
  * **Customized & stress-free planning is a Granite Rose promise.** With tons of experience producing outstanding celebrations, their seasoned team will help you put together an event to remember with all the trimmings—and within your budget.
