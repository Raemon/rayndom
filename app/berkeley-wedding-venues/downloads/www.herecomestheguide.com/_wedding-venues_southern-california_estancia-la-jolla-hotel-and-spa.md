## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The golden rays of La Jolla's year-round sun warm the lush, 9-acre grounds,** saltwater pool, and plush event venues of this peaceful, AAA Four Diamond-rated hotel. Ample on-site amenities make it for fabulous destination weddings: rancho-themed restaurants and intimate private dining rooms are all wonderful options for pre- and post-wedding gatherings, there's a full-service spa, and the beach is mere minutes away.
  * **Sumptuous botanicals, native greenery, and elegant, Spanish-style structures** surround the Garden Courtyard. Two tiled staircases—perfectly crafted for a grand entrance— sweep down to a picturesque fountain, where you'll exchange vows. The Olive Garden is equally lovely, bounded by colorful blooms, Italian cypress, and evergreen hedges, with two statuesque olive trees framing the ceremony site.
  * **The distinctive banquet rooms exude a contemporary freshness,** without losing the charm of the hotel's signature California Rancho vibe. The spacious La Jolla Ballroom boasts upscale custom-designed furnishings, like textured wall treatments, modern lighting, and whimsical flooring, while the Grande Room is enhanced with herringbone wood floors and contemporary golden accents. Both offer adjacent patios for a breezy indoor/outdoor flow.
