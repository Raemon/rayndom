## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Over 100 acres of North Georgia beauty set this family-run venue apart from the crowd,** with creeks, ponds, hundreds of mature hardwood trees, sprawling pastures, and farm buildings…including a romantic covered bridge over a stream.
  * **Take your pick from an array of sweet, nature-forward ceremony sites,** including a peaceful meadow with an ornate “altar” in the form of antique garden trellis. There are two renovated barns (one grand, one intimate) for receptions, and ample space for outdoor gatherings, too.
  * **Kick your cocktail hour up a notch on the cuteness meter** **with “Off the Wagon”,** the farm’s adorable vintage trailer-turned-mobile bar. Service includes signature cocktails, premium beer and wine, and non-alcoholic refreshers like sweet tea and lemonade.
