## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Surrounded by nature's beauty, this relaxed mountain retreat** on 5.5 acres in scenic Oak Glen positively exudes timeless charm. A sense of calm immediately envelops you amid the majestic oaks, towering sycamores, fragrant lilac fields, and heirloom apple orchards—a remnant of the property's past as a working farm.
  * **Gorgeous old-growth trees grace the peaceful ceremony site.** Here, vows are exchanged on a terraced stage in front of the picturesque façade of a country chapel with the green foothills as a backdrop. The reception courtyard is equally lovely, with wooden buildings, a weathered water tower, and the warm golden glow of gas lamps evoking a vintage elegance.
  * **Their attentive staff, all-inclusive packages, and in-house vendors** mean that you can relax and enjoy the day, taking advantage of your scenic surroundings. The photo ops throughout this locale are amazing, from lush lawns and woodsy paths to a waterfall spilling over boulders into a rock-strewn pool. You might even glimpse a deer or two grazing nearby since the area is a wildlife sanctuary!
