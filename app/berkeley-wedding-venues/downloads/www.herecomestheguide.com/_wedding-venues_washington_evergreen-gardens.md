## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on four private acres of beautifully manicured gardens,** walking paths, and towering trees, this peaceful oasis sits just 90 minutes from Seattle, and less than an hour from the San Juan Islands and Canada.
  * **Wed on the lush lawn, then follow with games and cocktails.** Make sure to take some time for photos around the romantic grounds before moving to the beautiful open-sided pavilion, with its dramatic cathedral-style ceiling.
  * **The spacious, charming cedar log Lodge** is available for overnight accommodations. It sleeps up to ten guests, and features a chef’s kitchen, welcoming communal spaces, and even a hot tub and pickleball court.
