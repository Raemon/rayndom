## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A charming hill country destination just 15 minutes from downtown Austin** , the venue is set on 17 acres full of pecan and oak trees, a creek, freshwater springs, a pond, and blooming wildflowers in the spring.
  * **You have multiple ceremony and reception options, both indoors and out:** The 6,000-square-foot climate-controlled building has exposed wood beams and romantic lighting, plus an all-glass back wall. You can also opt to use the open-air Creek Side Pavilion or a number of other locations on the beautifully landscaped grounds.
  * **Whimsical and unique touches** , such as lawn games, vintage buffets, marquee letters that spell out LOVE, a hand-carved stone cross, and strings of outdoor bistro lights are all included. A favorite add-on with couples are the adorable “drink” donkeys, Opie and Sassy, who are trained to carry beverages to your guests!
