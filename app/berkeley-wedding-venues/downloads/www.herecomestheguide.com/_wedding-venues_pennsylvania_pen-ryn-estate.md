## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled on over 100 acres of private riverfront property, this historic estate** will transport you back in time. Three unique venues provide plenty of options, and you'll enjoy the expert guidance of the events team throughout the planning process, from selecting a menu with the award-winning culinary staff to ensuring your champagne glass is full all night light.
  * **The Georgian-style Pen Ryn Mansion exemplifies luxury and refinement,** with an expansive interior that encompasses a grand foyer, library, gallery, and light-filled ballroom. A red brick pathway leads past a three-tiered fountain to a lovely white pergola on the lawn, where you can exchange vows with sweeping river views.
  * **A covered portico leads into the elegant Belle Voir Manor,** which boasts a private courtyard, expansive wooden ballroom, and dramatic grand staircase. For a more modern feel, opt for the River's Edge Pavilion, a light-filled, climate-controlled tent complex with one clear side that can be set open or closed, ensuring epic views year-round.
