## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s got a cozy, jazz-club vibe.** Here, you’ll find tall brick walls, silhouettes of musicians, and a “secret” loft area at the top of a spiral wrought-iron staircase (with comfy seating from which to spy the proceedings, of course.) The overall effect is that of a fun, New Orleans speakeasy. 
  * **There are lots of cool details you’ll love.** Let the peaceful sounds of a trickling, tiered fountain greet your guests in the foyer. Once they’re inside, the baby grand player piano will roll out some favorite tunes. And when they’re in the main gallery, softly twinkling “stars” in the ceiling will bring the magic of a dazzling night sky indoors.
  * **You can rent many necessities directly from the venue.** Gallery J gives you access to loads of wedding essentials for which you’d normally require an outside vendor. Tables, linens, décor—even photo booths and lighting.
