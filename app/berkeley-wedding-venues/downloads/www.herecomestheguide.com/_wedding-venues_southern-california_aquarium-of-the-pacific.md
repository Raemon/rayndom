## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Imagine exchanging vows in an iridescent blue wonderland,** illuminated by slivers of light filtered through the vast expanse of water on all sides. At the Aquarium of the Pacific, you can experience this very thing: ceremonies in the the soaring three-story kelp exhibit exude a magical under-the-sea feel you simply can't find anywhere else.
  * **Celebrations can unfold throughout the museum,** set among unique exhibits, high-tech multimedia displays, and dynamic art installations. In the Great Hall, multiple skylights illuminate an enormous suspended blue whale that presides majestically over the festivities, while the stunning, glass-walled Pacific Visions building showcases state-of-the-art immersive experiences in three sleek galleries.
  * **Intimate events often take place upstairs at the Veranda Roof Top,** a popular spot where gorgeous sunsets over the nearby Rainbow Harbor are a regular occurrence. Here, the scent of the ocean is carried on the breeze, along with the calls of exotic birds from nearby Lorikeet Forest, an outdoor aviary that mimics the lush coastal lowlands of Australia.
