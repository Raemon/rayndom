## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **An urban oasis along the Savannah River's edge** where the Historic District meets the Eastern Wharf, this sleek hotel is a true Southern gem, offering gracious hospitality, a vibrant, bustling location, and chic, stylish event spaces. 
  * **Exchange vows on the lawn at the water's edge,** followed by a celebration in the decadent mid-century ballroom under the sparkling, modern chandeliers. Or, opt for the Art Deco Sunroom, which boasts an airy al fresco terrace. Either way, you'll enjoy delectable, ingredient-led menus, which combine regional classics with global flavors.
  * **Plush accommodations await overnight guests.** Though the hotel is an easy walk to area attractions, they'll be tempted to stick around for things like the sprawling pool deck and cabanas, state-of-the-art fitness center with Peloton bikes, and the innovative rooftop Bar Julian, which features a Mediterranean-inspired menu and hand-crafted cocktails.
