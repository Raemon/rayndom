## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Rustic yet refined, the inn's beautiful county setting** is surrounded by open pastures and a hydroponic farm. Stone cottages built around a private courtyard welcome guests with their warm, relaxing atmosphere, and each comes with its own patio.
  * **Exchange vows indoors or outdoors.** Say "I do" in one of the beautiful reception halls, or outside on the property's stunning grounds. A plethora of picture-perfect photo locations offer dreamy settings to capture unforgettable portraits.
  * **Pamper your guests (and yourself!) with plush amenities**. Indulge in in-room treatments, complete with professional hair and makeup stations. Fully equipped dressing rooms, a game room and a media room are all at your disposal, too.
