## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Surrounded by seven acres of lawns and gardens,** this historic estate and its 1825 mansion offer multiple indoor and outdoor celebration options, all with incredible views of the ocean and the Boston skyline.
  * **We especially love the ceremony gazebo,** with its sweet gingerbread wood detailing and shake shingle roof. Or, you can opt to exchange vows inside the mansion, in the intimate Tudor Room. Follow with a party in the two-tiered ballroom, with its beautiful wood floor and permanent stage.
  * **The entire mansion is yours for the day,** as the Estate only hosts one wedding at a time. And packages include loads of helpful extras, like complimentary guest parking, and the assistance of a top-notch events team.
