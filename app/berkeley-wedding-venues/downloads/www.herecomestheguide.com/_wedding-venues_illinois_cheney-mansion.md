## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on two acres of impeccably manicured grounds** in the Historic District of Oak Park, the 12,000-square-foot Cheney Mansion is reminiscent of an English country home.
  * **Wedding receptions can be held in any of several rooms in the mansion** , as well as outdoors on the greenhouse patio or expansive lawns. A tent can be set up for a large group, too. And from the grand staircase in the main house to the gorgeous landscaping, your photographer will find plenty of wonderful photo opportunities.
  * **Your rental comes with some nice amenities:** prep rooms for the couple, on-site parking, and the Mansion's staff on hand to assist with your event.
