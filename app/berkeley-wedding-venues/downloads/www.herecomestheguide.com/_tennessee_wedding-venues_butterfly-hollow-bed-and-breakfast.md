## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked at the end of a shady country road, this dreamy bed and breakfast** sits in a picturesque hollow in the Cumberland Foothills. It features quaint rustic wood buildings nestled among trees and gardens, and stone walking paths that wind through the peaceful property.
  * **Ceremonies can take place in a sweet hillside gazebo** , a historic barn, or your choice of several other pretty spots around the grounds. Follow your vows with an intimate dinner in the open-sided, timber-framed barn.
  * **Small weddings and elopements are a specialty, and their experience shows.** Whether it’s just the two of you or you’ve invited a few of your closest loved ones, the staff will arrange a warm, personal experience tailored to your wishes. For a perfect end to the day, be sure to book a room in the cozy farmhouse for your wedding night.
