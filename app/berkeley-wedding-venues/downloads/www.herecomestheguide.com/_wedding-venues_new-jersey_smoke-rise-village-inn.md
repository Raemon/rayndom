## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With a rich history dating back to 1862,** this historic stone gem offers guests a chance to step back in time…and it’s less than 90 minutes from the heart of Manhattan. 
  * **Artfully manicured gardens offer plenty of sweet photo spots,** and the venue itself features both indoor and outdoor celebration areas, including a charming patio and grand ballroom.
  * **Craft the exact menu you’re dreaming of,** whether you’d like a formal seated affair or casual cocktail bites. They can even arrange nourishing nibbles while you’re getting dressed, and late-night snacks as the party rocks on.
