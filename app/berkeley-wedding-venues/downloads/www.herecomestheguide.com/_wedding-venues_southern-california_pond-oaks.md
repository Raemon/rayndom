## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled on three woodsy acres studded with pretty ponds,** this family-owned retreat exemplifies the natural beauty of the California wilderness. Photo ops abound here: some of our favorite options include golden hour along the mountain road, a sweet moment on the tree swing, and goofy shots with your wedding party in the cool, retro prep glamper.
  * **The ceremony courtyard, shaded by abundant oak trees,** sits alongside a dramatic rock face to create a beautiful natural backdrop. Many couples choose to add wood barrels, twinkle lights, or cascading florals to the wood arch, thought it's equally lovely when kept simple, illuminated by dappled sunlight through the leaves.
  * **Inclusive packages, carefully customized to match your vision and needs,** all**** feature full-service planning, a catered dinner, a complete floral package, a DJ & emcee, a sparkler exit, and much more. Plus, the welcoming, seasoned in-house staff will be by your side every step of the way to ensure the whole process is a joy.
