## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This world-class museum, housed in a massive Beaux Arts structure in the city's historic core,** contains**** one of the most complete collections of Asian art in the world... and a series of diverse, adaptable, and one-of-a-kind event venues. You're welcome to take over a single space, or flow throughout the building—we're particularly fond of a strolling cocktail hour, allowing your guests to explore the museum's vast collections.
  * **Just off the lobby, you'll find the jaw-dropping Grand Staircase and Loggia.** Two flights of travertine marble steps lead up to the Loggia, an airy arcade lined with glass cases showcasing distinctive Asian ceramics. Many couples exchange vows on the stairs, followed by a reception in the equally opulent Samsung Hall, which continues the visual theme of columns and marble, now paired with enormous windows and intricate metalwork.
  * **For a more contemporary setting, opt for the North and South Courts.** Their thoroughly modern and minimalist design features clean lines, a marble floor, and an angular ceiling of skylights nearly three stories above. Because of their considerable size, the courts lend themselves to creativity: the atmosphere is easily transformed into an upscale lounge, a modern disco hall, or anything else you envision.
