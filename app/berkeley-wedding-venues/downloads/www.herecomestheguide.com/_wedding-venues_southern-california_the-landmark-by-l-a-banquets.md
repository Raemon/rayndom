## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Surrounded by manicured gardens, this three-acre gated estate exudes sophistication and style.** Led by the experts at L.A. Banquets, celebrations here are custom-curated to each couple's unique vision, with infinite options that include a gracious outdoor space, majestic lobby and bar (manned by expert mixologists, of course!), and a cutting-edge ballroom that can accommodate over 700 guests.
  * **A jaw-dropping Grand Ballroom with 25-foot ceilings delivers the drama,** thanks to glittering chandeliers and customizable LED lighting that transforms the space from classic elegance to full-on party. All of the luxe necessaries are already included in your rate, but they're happy to arrange special rentals and services, too, like interactive elements, photo booths, and exceptional entertainment.
  * **The venue's unrivaled luxury is matched by the VIP, white-glove service.** We especially love including details that make the pre-ceremony hours feel extra special: in the dressing suites, you'll enjoy personal maître d’ service, with champagne, fresh fruit, pastries, and coffee, and as your guests arrive for the vows, they'll be greeted with hand-passed champagne, wine, and nibbles.
