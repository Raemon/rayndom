## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Once a bustling port along the banks of the South River,** this historic town has now become a beautiful park and venue, housing lush gardens, nature-inspired gathering spaces, and a few gently-restored buildings dating to the mid-1700s. 
  * **Exchange vows surrounded by year-round blooms** in the artfully curated gardens, then move to the elegant, clear-sided tent to continue your all-outdoor celebration.
