  * **The historic Georgian-style building is in the heart of downtown Chattanooga** , allowing guests convenient access to the charming neighborhood and riverfront. The city’s free electric shuttle stops every five minutes right outside the hotel’s front door.
  * **A 1920s-era ballroom feels like stepping back in time** , with a soaring ceiling hung with original crystal chandeliers, a black-and-white checkered dance floor, silver-leafed woodwork, and rows of mirrors that reflect the romantic glimmer of candlelight. 
  * **Guests will love the boutique accommodations** , which feature Drexel heritage furniture, plush beds, city views, as well as the hotel’s fabulous amenities—including a decadent indoor “zero-edge” pool.
