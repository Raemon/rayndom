## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **There are multiple gorgeous backdrops to choose from** for your walk down the aisle. Ceremony settings include the private Members Beach Club along Lido Key, the rooftop Sunset Terrace overlooking the Gulf of Mexico, and the Healing Garden next to Sarasota Bay.
  * **The distinctive Ritz-Carlton Grand Ballroom makes a lasting impression.** It features iron chandeliers, a coffered ceiling, and walls lined with Italian fabric. There's also a glamorous prefunction space with large paneled windows, a baby grand piano, and an adjacent terrace.
  * **You'll have a blissfully seamless planning experience** with a dedicated event manager. And wedding packages include hors d'oeuvres, a three-course plated meal or buffet, a wedding cake or dessert buffet station, wine service, an open hosted bar, and much more.
