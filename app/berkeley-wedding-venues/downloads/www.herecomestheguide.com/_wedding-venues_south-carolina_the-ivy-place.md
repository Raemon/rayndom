## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on the grounds of a mid-1800s dairy farm,** this special, family-owned estate features colorful manicured gardens and beautifully preserved historic buildings, wrapped in a surround of lush woodlands. 
  * **Pick your favorite ceremony spot****from an array of endlessly pretty backdrops** (we’re partial to the ponds and fountain), then celebrate the day beneath the spacious shelter of the 4,000 square-foot open-sided reception tent. 
  * **Two customizable packages** **allow you to choose the fit that’s right for you,** whether it’s a one-day affair or a Friday evening-to-Sunday morning slot that allows a bit more time for setup and breakdown…and lets you truly soak in this gorgeous property.
