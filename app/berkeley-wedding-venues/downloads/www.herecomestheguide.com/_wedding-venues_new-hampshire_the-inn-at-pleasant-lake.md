## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled on pristine Pleasant Lake and backed by dramatic mountain views,** this historic New Hampshire inn offers couples a 150-year legacy of hospitality in an intimate, owner-operated setting. Whether you envision a quaint lakeside elopement or a grand destination celebration, the charming on-site accommodations and ample gathering spaces provide plenty of flexibility.
  * **The intimate Wedding Garden is tucked away from the main property** for a tranquil, secluded feel, with a pretty white pergola for exchanging vows. Larger gatherings unfold on the adjacent Green, which is easily tented, while more intimate gatherings can be held in the authentic 18th-century barn, where handhewn timber beams are draped in twinkle lights.
  * **The cuisine is truly farm-to-table, and couldn’t be more local:** The**** award-winning chef creates custom menus featuring ingredients from their own herb garden and local partnerships. Comprehensive weekend wedding packages keep the planning process simple, with options for rehearsal dinners in the elegant Oak Room, sun-soaked brunches on the Patio, and so much more.
