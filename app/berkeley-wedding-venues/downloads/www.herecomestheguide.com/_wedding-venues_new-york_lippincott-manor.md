## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This quaint, private property occupies one of the prettiest spots** in Ulster County, and boasts open meadows, bountiful gardens, and views of the Wallkill River and Shawangunk Mountains.
  * **Wed beneath the natural log arbor, as your guests look on from hand-hewn benches** shaded by white market umbrellas. Follow with cocktails and lawn games on the grass, and a celebration in the rustic-elegant reception hall. 
  * **They offer a range of reasonably priced packages** , and you can add some really fun enhancements, like a cordial or frozen drink station, lemonade or cider stand, and a bonfire—s'mores included!
