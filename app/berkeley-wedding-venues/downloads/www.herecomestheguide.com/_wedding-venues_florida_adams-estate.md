## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With an air of Old Florida elegance, this stately 1940s estate** sits proudly on an exquisite lakefront property, offering a grand backdrop for your nuptials. The mansion itself is yours on the big day: the entire second floor is a photo-ready dressing suite (the other party preps in the charming Boat House), and each of the four light-filled spaces on the first floor are outfitted with French doors that lead onto the gorgeous grounds and airy terraces.
  * **Spanish-moss draped oaks frame panoramic vistas of Lake Alfred** in the lovely Wedding Garden, a verdant sweep of green accented with a pretty brick path. Two lakefront terraces invite you to celebrate al fresco in any weather—there’s the open-air terrace set against the mansion’s striking facade, and the glass-enclosed, climate-controlled tent, both with ample space for dining and dancing.
  * **Whether you envision an intimate micro-wedding or a luxurious multi-day retreat,** there are endless options for customizing the celebration of your dreams. All rentals include exclusive use of the estate and lush grounds, with delicious in-house catering, event coordination, and 16 private guest cottages that can sleep up to 56 loved ones.
