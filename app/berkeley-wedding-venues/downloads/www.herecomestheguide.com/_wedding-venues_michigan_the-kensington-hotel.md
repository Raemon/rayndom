##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **This beloved Ann Arbor hotel boasts a refreshingly modern vibe,** ensuring your celebration has a ton of style with no hint of stuffiness. There’s a lot to love for overnight guests, too—like the city’s largest hotel pool, a dry sauna, delicious dining options, and even a glass of champagne to welcome you “home”! 
  * **Exchange vows in a pretty, private courtyard adorned with twinkling bistro lights** for a magical atmosphere, and boasting easy access to the sophisticated Grande Ballroom for dining & dancing. The Conservatory is another wonderful option, where crisp white walls and sparkling contemporary chandeliers glow beneath a unique, coffered skylight.
