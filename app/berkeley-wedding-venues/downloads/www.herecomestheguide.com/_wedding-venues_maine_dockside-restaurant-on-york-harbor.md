## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A private marina along picturesque York Harbor** presents a dreamy scene from the grounds of this waterfront boutique B&B. Family operated for over 60 years, it’s a quaint, tranquil destination that captures the essence of coastal Maine.
  * **Descend the steps of the inn’s charming back porch** to meet your partner for vows overlooking the rocky shore. Follow with a tented celebration, or opt for the classically pretty ballroom, with its hardwood dance floor and oversized windows that let in the light and the views. 
  * **Gracious rooms and suites offer ample lodging choices** for overnight guests, allowing you to easily turn the festivities into a destination weekend. While away the days relaxing on the sandy beaches, hopping aboard a pleasure or fishing cruise, or taking day trips to seek out off-the-path lobster shacks.
