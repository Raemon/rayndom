## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This gracious family-owned farm sets a romantically pastoral scene,** with sweeping lawns studded with stone paths and pretty white fences, meticulously manicured gardens and lush wildflower meadows, post-and-beam barns and cozy fire pits, and mature sugar maples that bear witness to it all.
  * **Thoughtfully restored and still beautifully rustic, the historic 19th-century Event Barn** is truly the best of both worlds. Natural light illuminates the barn’s lovely details, and an open floor plan encourages you to make the space your own. The adjacent Pavilion, draped in gauzy fabrics and shimmering twinkle lights, is covered though open to the air, creating a refreshing indoor/outdoor vibe.
  * **Weddings of all shapes and sizes enjoy exclusive access to the venue,** whether you envision an intimate micro-wedding or a grand weekend-long soiree. You’ll also enjoy access to two dressing suites, a handmade timber arbor and benches for your ceremony, farmhouse tables and wooden chairs, and a dedicated prep space your chosen caterers will love.
