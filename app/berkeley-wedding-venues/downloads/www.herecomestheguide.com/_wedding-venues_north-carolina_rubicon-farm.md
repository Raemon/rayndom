## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Graceful magnolia trees dot the lush, six-acre lawn** of this charming, family-run farm just outside historic Pinehurst. At its heart: a beautifully restored 1820 farmhouse, complete with a full-length front porch. 
  * **There’s a sweet wooden pergola for your ceremony…** or you may choose to wed beneath the branches of one of the ancient trees, and the manicured grounds offer more than enough space for cocktails, outdoor games, dinner, and dancing. 
  * **Bespoke, flexible packages can fit the needs of any celebration,** from sweet, simple micro-weddings to grand, fully turnkey affairs that include overnight accommodations. They even offer a “Luxe Elopement” package that creates the feel of an opulent soiree…for a much smaller guest list!
