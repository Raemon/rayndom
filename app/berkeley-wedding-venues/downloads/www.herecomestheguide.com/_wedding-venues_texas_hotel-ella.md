## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's an elegant Greek Revival mansion with a romantic history** —it was built as a wedding gift to Ella Newsome and Goodall Wooten in 1898. Now a charming boutique hotel, it's also home to a fascinating collection of modern art. 
  * **Exchange vows on the expansive lawn** , with the iconic hotel and a row of manicured hedges as your photogenic backdrop. Follow with a cocktail hour on the pool courtyard, and a reception in the wonderful Grand Ballroom, which opens gracefully onto a spacious veranda.
  * **Catering is provided by _Goodall's_** —the hotel's on-site restaurant and a local favorite (it's also a great spot for your rehearsal dinner or send-off brunch). Your guests are sure to love their comforting, classic American favorites, designed with a contemporary Austin twist.
