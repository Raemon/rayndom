  * **The quaint white gazebo in the garden** is a lovely place for exchanging vows, taking photographs, or enjoying cocktails.
  * **Floor-to-ceiling windows frame the verdant landscape** of the surrounding Blue Hills and let in the natural light and fresh air.
  * **A stretch limousine will bring you from your home to your ceremony** and reception sites, and a private dressing suite awaits to let you relax during the festivities.
