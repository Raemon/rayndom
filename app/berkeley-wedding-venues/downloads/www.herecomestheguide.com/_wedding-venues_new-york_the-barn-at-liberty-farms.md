## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s in a peaceful, idyllic spot in the Hudson Valley** , nestled in a private section of a 300-acre working organic farm and equestrian center. It’s just a short drive from the town of Hudson, and an easy day trip from NYC. 
  * **The barn itself is extraordinary.** Originally built to house thoroughbred stallions, the space is now refurbished and well-equipped to host events. Its most charming elements have been retained, like giant sliding doors at each end, and paddocks with wrought-iron doors (consider using them for photo booths, a bar, or even overflow seating!).
  * **Exchange vows in a beautiful wooded glen beneath a handmade birch arbor,** or elsewhere on the stunning property. Don't miss a photo op on the**** hilltop, with sweeping views of the Catskill Mountains in one direction, and the Berkshires in the other.
