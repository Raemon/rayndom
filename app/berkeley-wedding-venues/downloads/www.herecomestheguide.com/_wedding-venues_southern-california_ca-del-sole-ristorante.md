## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

Welcome to Ca’ Del Sole— “House of the Sun”—where life is good, the food even better, and the setting sublime. When you visit this updated version of an authentic trattoria, the tantalizing aroma of fresh roasted garlic and herbs mingled with an infectious mood of contentment will make you want to linger as long as possible.

Ca’ Del Sole was fashioned after a Venetian country inn. Details like dark wooden beams and the double-sided fireplace in the main dining rooms recall an Old World village where strangers are wined and dined, and even the most trivial milestone is cause for celebration.

However, a recent remodel brings contemporary chic to the rustic décor, artfully realized in the two adjoining private banquet rooms: the Gondolier and the Venetian. A new floor has a walnut patina that may make you think of a renovated Tuscan farmhouse, and a distressed white hutch displaying vintage ceramics lends a handcrafted touch. Italian Mod lounge furniture in tomato-red and marine-blue adds a colorful contrast to accents like oversized rough-hewn bowls adorning dove-gray walls. The eclectic blend all comes together beautifully, and provides a clean and classy canvas for your own event stylings.

At the far end of the Venetian, French doors lead you onto an L-shaped, brick terrace enclosed by smooth plaster walls. Vibrant bougainvillea spills from the top of a slanted wooden awning, while leafy trees, espaliered jasmine and creamy-white urns brimming with flowers transport you to a balmy Mediterranean garden. In the corner of the terrace, water cascades from a triple-tiered stone fountain, a refreshing backdrop for you and your fiancé to exchange wedding vows. An al fresco cocktail hour and reception are also divine out here, with cafe umbrellas for shade or heat lamps to ward off any chill.

An extra “wow factor” comes courtesy of the striped olive-and-white curtained cabanas along one wall, each sporting a stunning glass chandelier. These glamorous tents are ripe with event possibilities: You can showcase your wedding cake in one, your sweetheart table in the other, and a distinctive head table in the spacious center cabana. Next to the terrace, Ca’ Del Sole’s new bar patio is so cool that it’s already a local hotspot. Also cool: There are no room charges at Ca’ Del Sole, so feel free to use the event spaces for everything from your shower to the most lavish gala.

Whatever type of gathering you host here, count on a chorus of satisfied “oohs” and “aahs” from your guests after their first bite of the tantalizing cuisine. The light Northern Italian fare lets classic Mediterranean flavors shine through—garlic and capers, parmesan and polenta—each dish is a feast for the senses. The fresh, imaginative creations taste like the ingredients were plucked from the sun-kissed hills of Veneto. And if there’s any special food you require, just ask.

The ristorante’s approach is extremely professional, yet guests are able to relax amid a joyous atmosphere. “We at Ca’ Del Sole want to make everyone feel comfortable,” assures co-owner Signor Costella. Your event at the “House of the Sun” will have guests so comfortable that they won’t want to leave!
