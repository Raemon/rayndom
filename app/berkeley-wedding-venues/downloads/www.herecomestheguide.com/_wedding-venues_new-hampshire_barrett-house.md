## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Built in 1800 in the stately Federal style,** this New Ipswich estate has a romantic history: It was constructed as a wedding gift from Charles Barrett Sr. to his son and daughter-in-law, and was home to generations of their children and grandchildren.
  * **The estate’s buildings have been wonderfully maintained,** with interiors boasting period furnishings, art, and wallpaper. In the main house, you’ll find a quaint parlor and elegant ballroom, while the grounds feature treasures like an elevated gazebo surrounded by towering shade trees. 
  * **Rental fees help support Historic New England’s stewardship** and preservation of Barrett House and other important properties throughout the area. Your rental comes with a “thank you” membership to the organization, which includes free tours of this home and dozens of others.
