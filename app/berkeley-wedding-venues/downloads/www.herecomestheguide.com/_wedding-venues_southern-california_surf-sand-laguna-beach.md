## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Offering pristine beachfront luxury and unparalleled calm,** this full-service resort**** is renowned for both its prime Laguna Beach location and its proximity to the ocean. The event spaces, designed in a Mediterranean beach-luxe style, are adorned with a handsome and tasteful mix of blond hardwoods, airy hues of sand and cream, coffered ceilings, lots of whitewashed wood-shuttered windows, and unique works of art.
  * **The Pacific and Catalina Terraces are perched right above the sand,** with clear glass railings allowing an uninterrupted view of the azure waves and Catalina Island beyond; both are lovely for a ceremony or reception. Of course, you can also say "I do" right on the white sand beach, steps away from the rolling surf.
  * **Your guests won't want to leave (and they don't have to!).** All luxurious accommodations have seaview balconies with commanding views of the Pacific Ocean—perfect for soft sea breezes and spectacular sunset vistas. You won't be able to resist adding a few more days to your stay for some relaxation time at the plush AquaTerra Spa, or exploring Laguna's top-tier shopping and galleries, a short walk from the resort.
