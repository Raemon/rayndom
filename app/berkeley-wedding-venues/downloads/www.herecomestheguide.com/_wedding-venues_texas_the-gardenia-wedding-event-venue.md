## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **An easy drive from the Dallas/Ft. Worth Metroplex,** this unique private events venue is set on 40 idyllic acres, and features purpose-built spaces designed to host the most perfect of gatherings. 
  * **We’re in love with the darling chapel,** but there’s also a charming courtyard just right for outdoor ceremonies. Host cocktails on the lush lawn, then move to the stunning, natural-light-filled, reception hall. 
  * **The property features dressing suites** **for the couple,** a beautiful pond, sweet farmhouse tables and cross back chairs, and outdoor heaters so you can keep the party going once the sun goes down.
