## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **If you want it all for your wedding—and in one fabulous place—this lively hotel is ideal.** Located just a short stroll from Lake Tahoe's stunningly picturesque southern shore, it's the perfect one-stop shop, from the wedding shower and rehearsal dinner to the reception and post-wedding entertainment. They can also arrange discounted room blocks and transportation both locally and to the nearby airport, so that all you have to do is relax and enjoy.
  * **In the twelfth-floor Wedding Chapel, huge windows overlook the crystalline waters of the glacier lake.** After the "I do"s here, you can choose from an array of options. The Evergreen and Aspen Ballrooms, each with 14-foot-ceilings and state-of-the-art tech, can be combined for a large gathering, or divided for more intimate guest counts. If you're looking to emphasize the "party" in wedding party, check out Opal, their vibrant casino lounge.
  * **There's so much to do here that it's easy to turn your wedding into an extended getaway.** On-site activities start with getting pampered at the Spa, swimming in their fabulous lagoon-style indoor pool, and checking out the action in the casino. Looking for something a bit more athletic or even Zen? Try a round of golf at the course next door, mountain bike around the lake, or simply take a peaceful hike among the tall trees.
