## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This elegant 1912 rosebrick Tudor mansion has long played host to spectacular parties.** Originally commissioned by shipping heir Frederick Kohl and his wife, the grand estate has since been restored and revitalized as a stellar venue: now with the added bonus of a terrific events team to help bring your vision to life.
  * **The gracious interior rooms provide a taste of the home's original grandeur.** The wood-paneled Library features a large marble fireplace, bookcases, and graceful French doors that open to a center courtyard. The sizable Great Hall was built for music and entertaining: its very high ceiling, oak paneling, and walnut flooring create a fine acoustical setting... and a fab place to dance.
  * **Stroll with your guests around the manicured boxwood hedges** that frame the formal rose garden, where over 100 hybrid tea roses in myriad colors provide a sweet perfume to the air. A large terrace leads from here to the light-flooded Morning Room, whose white lattice walls and black-and-white marble floor add a touch of formality to the East Wing.
