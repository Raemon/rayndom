## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The breathtaking Franconia Range provides a stunning backdrop** for this White Mountains retreat, whose lovely grounds and adaptable venue allow you to have everything, from rehearsal dinner to farewell brunch, in one gorgeous location. 
  * **A charming gazebo and arbor are set right along Shadow Lake** at the resort’s heart, creating a dreamy spot for ceremonies and celebratory cocktails. Lakeview Reception Hall is just steps away, and its towering floor-to-ceiling windows and private attached patio lend ideal indoor-outdoor flow to the airy, light-filled space. 
  * **Resort rooms, cottages, bungalows, and rustic houses** spread across the resort’s sprawling grounds, and ensure there’s just the right fit for all your guests. Fishing and paddleboat use is free for all overnighters, and the resort is minutes away from some of the area’s most beautiful hiking and scenic drives.
