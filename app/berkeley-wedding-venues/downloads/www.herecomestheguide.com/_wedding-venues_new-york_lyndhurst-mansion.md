  * **There are gathering options spread throughout the estate,** thanks to its sprawling grounds and host of historic buildings. Your choices include the romantic Rose Garden, the covered Veranda, an inviting Courtyard, and the Alley Lawn, which sits adjacent to a wonderful 100 year-old bowling alley.
  * **Food, bar, and event execution will be orchestrated by one of four partners** at Culinart Group Catering Collection. Each boasts decades of experience in the industry, and each has a distinctive style, so you’re guaranteed to find the menu and cocktail selections that match your vision.
