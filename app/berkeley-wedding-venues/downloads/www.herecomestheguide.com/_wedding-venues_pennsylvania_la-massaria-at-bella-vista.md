## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **If you’re looking for rustic charm, this place delivers.** Although La Massaria once housed the stables on a farm, it’s been transformed into an elegant banquet facility. During the renovation, a lot of care went into restoring the stone walls, barn boards, and beams from the original 1802 structure.
  * **You’ll receive VIP treatment.** From the planning process through the big day, the management team will attend to every last detail. Their goal is to make sure you and your guests feel like royalty.
  * **Their all-inclusive wedding packages help take the stress out of planning.** Your five-hour reception will include cocktails, hors d’oeuvres and an open bar, followed by a lavish three-course dinner. They can also provide gorgeous floral centerpieces, a wedding cake, and other desserts.
