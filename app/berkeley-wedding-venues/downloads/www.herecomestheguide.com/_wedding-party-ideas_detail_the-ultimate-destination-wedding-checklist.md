# The Ultimate Destination Wedding Checklist

## Dreaming of a destination wedding? We don't blame you. Few things can compare to the thrill and romance of jet-setting to say "I do"

**But, reality check:** If you're planning an international affair, your wedding planning challenges just got taken up a notch. Tack on a few thousand miles, language barriers, and regulations in a foreign country, and things can get pretty tricky.

**Luckily, we've put together a comprehensive Destination Wedding Checklist** to help you navigate through the logistics and smoothly sail to Happily Ever After.

## 12–16 Months To Go...

  * **Work out your**[**budget**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/6-simple-steps-to-setting-a-wedding-budget)**.** This includes most of the typical wedding items, but also travel expenses like airfare and accommodations.  

  * **Draft up your**[**guest list**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/tips-wedding-guest-list)**.** This will be directly related to your budget.  

  * **Decide on a country or region you'd like to get married in.** Be sure to check which seasons have the best weather (and no hurricanes).  

  * **Talk about marriage license options with your fiancé.** Marriage requirements vary from country to country. They range from blood tests (no, we aren't kidding) and waiting periods to extra fees. So unless you're planning on running to your nearest courthouse for a civil ceremony prior to the wedding day, find out what the country you've chosen requires in order to make it official. See the country's tourism website for details.  

  * **Do you and your fiancé have your passports or travel visas?** If not, [start the application process ASAP.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports.html) (Some countries require that it be valid for a minimum of 6 months prior to the ceremony. Plus, it can take months to process!)  

  * **Hire a planner. Do not skip this step.** When it comes to international matters and planning from afar, a seasoned professional is essential in helping you manage the process. Bonus points if they're fluent in your wedding country's language.  

  * **Book a travel agent.** [Travel agencies that specialize in destination weddings](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/category/questions-to-ask-your) can match you up with a location that fits your vision. They'll also negotiate with venues to get you the best pricing, perks, and upgrades!  

  * **Secure a**[**wedding venue**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/top-destination-wedding-venues-united-states)**and set your date!** Get all details and contracts in writing and send in a deposit if needed. (It's great if you're able to take a pre-wedding trip out there to view venues in person, but this isn't always possible—or necessary. If you can't visit, scour the web for trusted reviews—and get input from that travel agent and/or wedding planner you hired!)  

  * **Do you need wedding insurance?** It's something to think about. Check with your venue about liability insurance and consider other options like cancellation insurance.  

  * **Reserve your honeymoon suite.** If it's at the same venue you're getting married at, you can do this at the same time you book your wedding.

## 9–11 Months To Go...

  * **Recruit your wedding party.** Make sure they have all passports and any other identification needed to travel (or information on how to obtain the required ID).  

  * **Send out Save The Dates.** This is important! For a destination wedding, send them out early in order to give your guests plenty of time to make travel and accommodation arrangements (and plenty of notice to save up their vacation days!).  

  * **Set up a wedding room block.** Research the best group hotel accommodations near (or at!) your wedding venue, and let your guests know of any promotional codes they'll need to secure the discounted rate.  

  * **Create a**[**wedding website**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/ultimate-guide-to-creating-your-wedding-website) that includes details on travel and accommodations. Include local maps, airport information, and registry details, as well as predicted weather so your guests will know what to pack.  

  * **Plan any additional wedding-related events.** Since destination weddings require travel for almost all parties involved, they're naturally longer celebrations. Consider hosting additional events, such as a welcome party or post-wedding brunch. Planning these events early will enable you to add them to your RSVP card, so you'll know how many guests to expect.  

  * **Create your**[**gift registry**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/items-that-should-be-on-your-wedding-registry)**.** However, keep in mind that guests traveling for your wedding are already spending a pretty penny just to be there. You may want to let everyone know that their presence is present enough.  

  * **Say YES to the dress!** Or tux, of course. Take the ceremony and reception location into account, along with climate and local customs. Plus, keep in mind that you'll want to carry it onto an airplane, so a poofy ballgown may not be such a good idea.  

  * **Purchase your airline tickets.** Get those early bird deals!  

  * **Work with your wedding planner or venue coordinator to**[**find vendors**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/the-ultimate-guide-to-choosing-your-wedding-vendors)**.** If they're based in the U.S., be aware that you may need to pay for their travel fees. If they're based in your wedding destination, be sure to do some Skype consultations so you can "meet" before you book them!

## 6–8 Months To Go...

  * **Take**[**engagement photos**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/19-engagement-photo-ideas-that-rock-our-socks-off)**, if you'd like.** This can be with your wedding photographer if they're local to you. Otherwise, you may need to hire another photographer for _just_ an engagement session.  

  * **Work with your wedding venue and caterer to create the menu.** Unless you're able to fly out there before the wedding, you may not get a tasting until you arrive—if at all!  

  * **Book the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner location(s).** Destination wedding etiquette usually involves inviting everyone in attendance to the rehearsal dinner or some sort of pre-wedding event.  

  * **Schedule your dress fitting and get your wedding party attire.** This also includes any flower girl or ring bearer attire.  

  * **Order your wedding invitations.** You'll want to give guests plenty of time to RSVP, as well as point them to your wedding website for full details on accommodations, transportation, local attractions, wedding events, dress code, and gift registries.  

  * **Set dates and locations for bridal showers and bachelor/bachelorette parties.** Create your guest list for these events, and let your MOH or another trusted friend/family member handle the rest.  

  * **Book wedding-day transportation, if needed.** If your room block is at a separate location from your venue, set up a shuttle service for guest transportation to and from the wedding.  

  * **Continue booking vendors.** Definitely have your photographer and caterer locked in by now. You may also want to book the following:
    * Officiant
    * Florist
    * DJ or Band
    * Cake Maker
    * Videographer
    * Rentals & Linens
    * Hairstylist/Makeup Artist

  * **Start scheduling any informal recreational activities.** This is totally optional, but if you're going to be in a tropical paradise wouldn't a group snorkeling excursion be fun? Update your [wedding website](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/ultimate-guide-to-creating-your-wedding-website) to inform guests as plans are secured.
