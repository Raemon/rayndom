## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This high desert gem in historic Twentynine Palms, "The Gateway To Joshua Tree," offers authentic small-town charm,** and yet it's just minutes to a host of activities--from outdoor adventures to upscale lodging. It's the perfect place to party without a lot of fuss--and bust some moves on the beautiful built-in dance floor!
  * **Views for day****s include exceptional mountain desert panoramas** for incredible photo backdrops--sunsets are especially breathtaking! Lounge furniture gathered around fire rings is the perfect spot to chillax and enjoy the desert starscape. 
  * **Creative, affordable catering packages are a specialty of this fully-permitted event venue!** Rasta Rita also has a full liquor license and a health department-approved kitchen if you want to bring in your own catering. Better yet, opt for the locally famous Rasta Taco Margarita and Taco Trucks. The expert event team can also hook you up with specialty vendors + extras + upgrades to personalize this unique event space.
