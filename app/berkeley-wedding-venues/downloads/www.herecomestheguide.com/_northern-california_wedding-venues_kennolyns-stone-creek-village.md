## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A 300-acre redwood paradise in the Santa Cruz Mountains, Stone Creek Village at Kennolyn is an idyllic retreat that's perfect for weekend-long weddings.** With its spacious Town Square event plaza, the Village hosts unique mountaintop gatherings that are infused with whimsical + woodsy vibes.
  * **For a show-stopping ceremony in the forest, you can't beat the redwood amphitheater, with ample seating for your guests built right into the hillside.** "I dos" are exchanged in front of a mystical backdrop of towering trees, with twilight peeking through the branches. Then move on to the lively Town Square, where fire pits and romantic lighting enhance dinner and dancing under a star-filled sky. Late-night partiers can hang out in Caldwell Lodge, where a great river rock fireplace makes a cozy mingling spot. The Village also hosts a "Friday Night Campfire and S'mores" social, which is a super-fun way to kick off the whole weekend-long celebration!
  * **Your guests can experience a nostalgic extended stay in the Village's cozy cabin cottages and take advantage of the many on-site actvities:** swimming, tennis, basketball, volleyball, and scenic forest hiking trails to name a few. Kennolyn's experienced event professionals will assist you in orchestrating your outdoor celebration in whatever wedding style you're dreaming of. You'll also love their all-inclusive event package that let's you enjoy this special time with your friends and family--in a truly memorable setting.
