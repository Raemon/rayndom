## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Your wedding will be an adventure.** Host your reception in one of their beautiful spaces, and your guests will have the unforgettable experience of celebrating among elephants and dinosaurs and exploring fascinating exhibitions.
  * **Dine under the largest dinosaur ever discovered!** Unveiled in 2018 in Stanley Field Hall, the 122-foot-long, two-story tall titanosaur makes any event one-of-a-kind, but it's also flanked by life-size replicas of giant flying reptiles.
  * **The Northeast Terrace offers a spectacular view of the Loop** and the sweeping waters of Lake Michigan. It's a wonderful spot for al fresco ceremonies at golden hour, or invite guests to enjoy the view while mingling over specialty cocktails that have been custom-crafted for your nuptials.
