  * **Created by the team at Yanni Design Studio,** this gorgeous, flexible event space has a sleek, industrial-contemporary vibe and all the amenities you’ll need for a top-notch, seamless celebration… including the option to utilize the stellar on-site design services.
  * **The interior boasts a 21-foot ceiling** with exposed rafters hung with dazzling chandeliers and bespoke light installations. The glossy poured concrete floors gleam in sunlight pouring in through a wall of floor-to-ceiling windows. 
  * **Glass doors open to a lovely courtyard,** garden, and terrace. It’s a wonderful spot for an intimate ceremony or cocktail hour. A private guest suite is included in your rental, and can be used as your day-of dressing area or a posh VIP lounge.
