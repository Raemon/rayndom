## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set in the beloved “Town of Breck”, as it’s affectionately known to locals,** this place is internationally desirable for good reason—the charming vintage village offers sweeping mountain views and big city amenities, plus quick, easy, (and often free!) access to the mountain through its network of shuttles and gondolas. 
  * **The full-service resort features superb venues for weddings of all styles,** in all seasons, whether you’re envisioning a slope side micro-wedding with just the two of you, or an all-out ballroom bash. One of our top picks: Sevens, with its mountain-modern vibes, expansive deck, and floor-to-ceiling windows boasting views of the Continental Divide. 
  * **Feeling a little overwhelmed by all your incredible options?** Not to worry—the wedding experts at Vail Resorts (who operate this, and over 40 desirable mountain properties) are absolute stars at helping you navigate it all, whether it’s finding the perfect venue, choosing a place for your rehearsal dinner, or coordinating group lodging.
