## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Just outside the quaint southeastern Louisiana town of Amite** and an easy drive from Baton Rouge, you'll find the enchanting Greenery. Sister venue to The Berry Barn, it boasts greenhouse-inspired design, thoughtfully planned gathering spaces (including two dressing suites), and an awesome team of both in-house and local vendors.
  * **There’s a darling, white mini-chapel that’s so romantic for intimate vows,** but it can also serve as a romantic backdrop for larger ceremonies. The main reception space also boasts a brick-lined outdoor space where you can say “I do” framed by the hall’s lush entry arch, and the interior is flat-out stunning, with walls of windows, a vaulted ceiling, and tons of the venue’s namesake live greenery. 
  * **Two gracious one and two-bedroom Villas provide on-site lodging** and additional dressing area options, and still more overnighters can be accommodated at Pettito Barn & Farms (less than a mile away.) There’s also a cozy, apartment-style vacation property just a few minutes down the road.
