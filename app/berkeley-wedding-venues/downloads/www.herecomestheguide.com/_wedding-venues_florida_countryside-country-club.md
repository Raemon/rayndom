## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Expansive green fairways dotted with palm trees create a picture-perfect backdrop** at this Clearwater country club, which has been a fixture in the area since 1974. The courses include 27 holes of golf with sparkling water features and lush landscaping.
  * **An elegant ballroom with panoramic views of the grounds** provides room for celebrations large and small. Glowing chandeliers hang from the exposed-beam ceiling, and the palette of rich, warm neutrals can easily be personalized with your chosen colors.
  * **Get ready to be pampered at the on-site spa** , where you and your wedding party can enjoy customizable treatments such as microdermabrasion, hydrating body scrubs, facials, massages, waxing, and airbrush tanning services.
