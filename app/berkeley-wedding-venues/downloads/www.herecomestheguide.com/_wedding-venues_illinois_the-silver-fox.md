## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This beautifully restored 1905 building** in downtown Streator is suffused with the charm of a bygone era, with its hardwood floors, exposed brick walls, elegant wainscoting, and intricate tin ceilings illuminated by chandeliers.
  * **Spacious and accommodating** , the venue includes a second-floor meeting room that makes a gorgeous indoor ceremony location, a charming ballroom, a cocktail lounge with pool table, and two prep rooms for the wedding party.
  * **Outdoor ceremonies may be held in the stunning Weber Garden** , a remarkable 2-acre English country-style garden with 10 uniquely styled "rooms," each bursting with ever-changing plants, flowers, and trees, plus statuaries, sculptures, and fountains... all just one mile from The Silver Fox.
