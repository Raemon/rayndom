# Lake Life is Back! Austin's 10 Best Lakeview Wedding Venues

## 

**Some of Texas’ most beautiful waterfront wedding venues aren’t on the Gulf coast—they’re on a lake!** Just a short drive from Austin, the lakes and surrounding areas offer a natural environment with woods, hills, and prairie land, not to mention plenty of outdoor recreation options (fishing, boating, swimming, scuba diving, picnicking, camping, and zip lining). Host your wedding at any of these Austin lakeview venues, and you can easily turn your celebration into a vacation!
