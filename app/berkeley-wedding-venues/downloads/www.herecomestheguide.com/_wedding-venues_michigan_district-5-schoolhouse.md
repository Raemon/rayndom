## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With literal “old school” charm,** this sweet 1908 school house has been thoughtfully remodeled to preserve its historic character while adding all the amenities necessary for easy, gracious hosting. 
  * **Inside, you’ll find an open floor plan** that allows events to flow beautifully, with quaint vintage details like a pressed tin ceiling, original windows and floors, and fun blackboards you can use for party signage. 
  * **A large, tree-lined lawn** **offers a spot for outdoor ceremonies and games,** while a deck overlooking the yard can act as an al fresco lounge. Among tons of other perks, you’ll have access to a well-stocked decor closet and two generously sized dressing suites.
