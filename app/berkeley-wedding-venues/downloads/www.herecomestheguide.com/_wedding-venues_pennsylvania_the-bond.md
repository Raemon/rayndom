## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled in York’s Royal Square district,** this vintage, industrial-chic spot offers high style, tons of flexibility, and a great neighborhood whose cute historic streets make a fantastic photo backdrop. 
  * **The spacious, gorgeous event spaces** **create tons of options for crafting your perfect day,** from an airy ballroom to intimate ceremony spots, all featuring lovely details like polished concrete flooring, exposed brick and ductwork, and whimsical art. 
  * **A newly built space, Royal Square Gardens,** allows you to bring the party outdoors for some al fresco celebrating. Boasting market lights, a fireplace, and a pergola hung with elegant chandeliers, it makes a beautiful spot for your ceremony or cocktail hour.
