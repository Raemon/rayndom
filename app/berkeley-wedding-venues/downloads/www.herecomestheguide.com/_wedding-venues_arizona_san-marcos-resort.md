## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Situated in the heart of Chandler's historic downtown area** , this historic resort has been hosting unforgettable weddings since 1912. The cool underground speakeasy invites guests back in time, and its Roaring '20s vibe and authentic décor create a fabulously fun setting for a welcome party.
  * **From an intimate lawn ceremony bordered by palm trees** , to an elegant reception in the ballroom with its huge crystal chandeliers, the resort has a space that's right for your celebration. There's even a rooftop terrace with a 360-view of the surrounding greenery.
  * **Celebrate all weekend long without ever stepping off site,** from a rehearsal dinner under the airy pergola to a farewell brunch in the sun-drenched courtyard. An on-site Aveda spa offers pre-wedding pampering, or blow off some steam by booking a tee time right next door. Multicultural weddings and multi-day events are a specialty, and the expert staff will work with you to honor all your traditions.
