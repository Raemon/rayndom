## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of historic Charleston,** this creative, welcoming property blends the town’s rich history with a host of modern amenities, stylish design, and more than a touch of gracious Southern hospitality.
  * **The Courtyard is a lush urban hideaway,** boasting bountiful trees and foliage, inviting seating areas, and a whitewashed brick fireplace that creates a lovely backdrop for vows. When combined with the Greenhouse, a glass, atrium-style covered space, this unexpected oasis makes a lovely spot for your al fresco celebration.
  * **In the Hayne Street Gallery,** the hotel’s spacious ballroom, a wall of oversized windows allows for ample natural light to flow into the room, and high, coffered ceilings create vintage-inspired drama. A simple, creamy color palette works with virtually any design theme.
