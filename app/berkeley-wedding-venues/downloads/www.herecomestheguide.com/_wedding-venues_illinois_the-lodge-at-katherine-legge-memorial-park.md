## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Fifty-two acres of lush, picturesque parkland surround this historic lodge,** whose late-1920s design by renowned residential architect R. Harold Book is a charming combination of a stately Craftsman home and an English fairytale cottage. 
  * **The first floor features an inviting living space** with a fireplace, piano, kitchen, and intimate dining area. From here, doors open on both sides of the Lodge to quaint patios and lawns, allowing for wonderful indoor/outdoor flow.
  * **Upstairs, there’s an impressive ballroom** with a vaulted ceiling supported by dramatic exposed beams, another cozy brick fireplace, and a wall of French windows overlooking the grounds. This level also houses a sweet, light-filled, dressing area, perfect for getting-ready photos.
