## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Ideally located just inside the Mission Bay Channel** and ensconced by the sparkling waters of the Pacific, this warm, relaxed setting is the perfect backdrop for a classic coastal California celebration. Affordable rental rates, a flexible vendor policy, and a welcoming event staff provide you plenty of flexibility to craft your dream day.
  * **Two breezy outdoor ceremony sites boast picturesque views of the surrounding marina.** Make a grand entrance by vintage automobile, limo, or even horse-drawn carriage (they're happy to recommend a vendor), then stick around after the "I do"s to capture remarkable photos as the sun sets over the glistening water.
  * **As one of San Diego's only venues with multiple waterfront banquet facilities,** the options for your reception are truly endless. Each room is outfitted with elegant, unique features, like vaulted ceilings and lofted spaces, built-in dance floors, and—of course—those magical bay vistas framed by large windows.
