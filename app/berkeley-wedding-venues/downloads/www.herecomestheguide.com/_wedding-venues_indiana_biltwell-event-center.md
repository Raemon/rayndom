## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Formerly a window and door factory,** this 1922 gem has been renovated with an eye toward preserving the space's charm and vintage character. 
  * **Inside, you'll find gorgeous rooms boasting exposed brick and ductwork,** Edison lights, gleaming wood floors, built-in bars, and oversized windows. Outside, you'll find a deck and patio accessed by retractable glass doors and illuminated by romantic string lights.
  * **You and your photographer will love all the special nooks and crannies** for capturing memorable pics…some favorites include an antique freight elevator and an original bank vault.
