## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Designed for elegant, intimate micro-weddings and elopements,** this exquisite tropical garden boasts thousands of native plants, trees, and flowers. Nestled in a peaceful community overlooking Oahu's Kailua Bay, the vibe is romantic, lighthearted, and welcoming, with easy access to the beach for extra photo ops, or a quiet moment together on the sand.
  * **You’ll wed on a lush lawn with a view of the Pacific’s azure waters,** then stroll the romantic garden paths for incredible photos. For your reception dinner, there’s the elegant Balinese Cabana, set beneath plumeria, coconut palms, and shower trees. Live music, hula dancers, and custom playlists are welcome! 
  * **Full-service planning and event management is executed in-house,** along with hand-selected, high-quality furnishings that take the pressure off scrambling for topnotch vendors. Only one event is hosted per week, ensuring that your celebration receives the team’s full care and attention.
