## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Picture-perfect Big Island weddings are a specialty of this idyllic, full-service resort** set on the sun-splashed Kohala Coast. With gracious ballrooms and seven exquisite outdoor venues, thoughtfully curated packages, and topnotch cuisine, it's easy to customize your dream day (or weekend!) in this tropical paradise.
  * **Spectacular sunset ceremonies overlooking the ‘Anaeho’omalu Bay** take place on the lawns of the King’s Knoll or on the soft sands of Lindsey Beach. Follow with an al fresco reception on the palm-studded Lu'au Grounds or the Paniolo Ocean View Terrace, which boasts an adjacent ballroom ideal for a breezy indoor/outdoor celebration.
  * **The plush Na Hale Suites** **offer guests panoramic views and private lanais,** as well as other fabulous features like soaking tubs, walk-in closets, and double vanity sinks.**** There are also plenty of places for your loved ones to mingle: seated in lounge chairs at one of 3 resort pools (including an infinity pool), relaxing at the whirlpools, or having some fun on the beach volleyball courts.
