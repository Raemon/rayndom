## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s a working centennial farm set in a lush valley at the base of Mt. Wilson.** Owned and operated by descendants of its original homesteaders, the spot offers incredible 360-degree mountain and plateau views…and some very photogenic resident horses. 
  * **Whether you opt to exchange vows in the graceful aspen grove** or on the stunning ridge line, your ceremony is guaranteed to provide an outstanding panorama. Your reception can consist of an intimate dinner in the historic barn, or a larger celebration beneath a tent on the beautiful grounds. 
  * **Your rental includes use of the Ranch for three days,** including two on-site cabins for overnighters. Planning a winter wedding? Consider booking a cozy sleigh ride—complete with hot cocoa and freshly baked cookie—as a special treat.
