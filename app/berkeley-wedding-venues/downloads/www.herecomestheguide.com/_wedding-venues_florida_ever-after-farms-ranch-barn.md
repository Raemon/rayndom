## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This charming working quarter horse ranch** comes complete with photo ops galore, from the friendly resident horses to the swing and 1923 convertible Studebaker. We’re especially in love with the dressing suite, with its row of vanities and darling cow-print chairs. 
  * **Say “I do” beneath the branches of a moss-draped oak,** then move to the barn for your reception. Surrounded by beautiful views of the property and boasting rustic-modern design and romantic lighting, you’ll find you hardly need to provide extra décor for this lovely space. 
  * **It’s operated by the pros at Ever After Farms,** whose collection of working farms and top-notch barn venues have become some of Florida’s most beloved event destinations. Allow them use their thoughtful expertise to take care of your day-of management…you’ll be so glad you did.
