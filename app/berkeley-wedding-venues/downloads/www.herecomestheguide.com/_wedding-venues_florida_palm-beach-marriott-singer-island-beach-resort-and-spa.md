## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This four-diamond waterfront resort in the Palm Beaches** boasts an oceanic reef, topnotch cuisine, and stylish suites and amenities that will wrap your guests in luxury. From welcome parties at the casual Reef Tiki Bar to toes-in-the-sand ceremonies to grand receptions that flow between patios and ballrooms, there are endless options for your big day.
  * **The Ocean Terrace Gazebo, perched on a platform surrounded by a pond,** is an exquisite setting for your vows. Just steps away is a sparkling pool and patio, perfect for mingling: as the sun sets and the gentle sea breeze stirs the water, you and your guests will enjoy a spectacular ocean panorama.
  * **Lush tropical landscaping and bubbling fountains** make the Veranda a unique choice for an intimate outdoor reception or a cocktail hour before your party in the Colonnade Ballroom, a sleek contemporary space that is easily transformed to match any style or theme.
