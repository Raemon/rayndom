## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A remarkable cultural legacy accompanies this Spanish Colonial landmark,****** nestled**** in the chaparral-covered foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. The buildings and landscape capture the simple allure of vintage California, with red-tile roofs, brick and flagstone, all staged against the mountainous silhouette of the Angeles National Forest and overlooking a wilderness preserve, 
  * **Exchange vows on the breathtaking Terrace as the city lights begin to shimmer** on the horizon and the sun sets over the densely forested canyon. Just steps away is the Plaza Courtyard, where brick and stone paths amble among olive trees, manicured shrubbery and terracotta pots brimming with blooms, and twinkle lights sparkle above.
  * **Hand-carved mirrors and rich drapery accent the stunning Theatre Ballroom,** where your dinner is served beneath a vaulted ceiling studded with wrought-iron chandeliers. Its grand design enables each guest to witness everything that takes place, like the first dance, cake cutting, and bouquet toss, with plenty of room to dance the night away.
