## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You’ll find this heavenly resort tucked along Oak Creek** in the heart of Oak Creek Canyon. Just eight scenic miles outside Sedona, it offers a tranquil, nature-filled getaway with easy access to the iconic town and its stunning surroundings.
  * **The creekside gazebo sets a romantic scene for intimate vows along the rushing water,** as does the pretty lawn, which is shaded by mature pines. A courtyard strung with bistro lights hosts your al fresco reception. 
  * **A collection of spacious “creekhomes” can accommodate up to 40 guests,** and they’re ideally suited for both couples and groups, with wood-burning fireplaces, fully stocked kitchens, and private balconies overlooking either the creek or forest.
