## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s a beautifully preserved historic building** , now serving as an art gallery. One of only two remaining examples of Neoclassical Greek Revival architecture in Alexandria, its exterior features an impressive portico supported by soaring Doric columns. 
  * **Oversized windows bring natural light to the main gallery rooms** , which boast 24-foot ceilings, wonderful woodwork, and walls lined with rotating art exhibits.
  * **Your ceremony can be held in the sweet, private courtyard.** This quaint, romantic space has a “secret garden” feel, sheltered from the street by high red brick walls.
