## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Sleek, hip, and modern, this brand-new SOFA district hotel** fits right into the neighborhood's vibrant scene, but it's also just steps from Delray's pristine, peaceful beaches. 
  * **Choose a rooftop ceremony on the sweeping terrace** (the space can also be used for your cocktail hour or al fresco reception), or an indoor affair in the striking contemporary ballroom.
  * **Planning a destination wedding? Don't stress!** The coordinators here are experienced pros at helping couples manage details from afar—just show up and have the best weekend ever.
