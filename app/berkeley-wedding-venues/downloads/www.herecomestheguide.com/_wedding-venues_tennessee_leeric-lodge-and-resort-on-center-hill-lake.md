## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Offering truly breathtaking views of Center Lake** (which has been voted Tennessee’s most beautiful) and the Upper Cumberland Mountain Range, this nature-centered spot offers the perfect getaway…and it’s just an hour east of Nashville. 
  * **The spacious, climate-controlled Grand Reception Room** allows for year-round celebration, and there are tons of pretty options for outdoor events. We love the two dressing suites—they’re spread across the Lodge’s north and south wings, with a posh collection of vanity stations in one, and a hidden speakeasy in the other!
  * **They offer a selection of flexible, generous packages** that range from simple elopements to all-inclusive, three-day affairs. The Lodge can accommodate up to 26 people, so you can spend the days making forever-memories with your favorites.
