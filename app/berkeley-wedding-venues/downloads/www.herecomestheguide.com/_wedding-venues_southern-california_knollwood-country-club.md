## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Picture-perfect pines, eucalyptus, and verdant greens abound** at this welcoming golf course in the lovely Granada Hills. Thanks to its prime location in the foothills, the climate here is temperate and mild—a quality that makes it particularly attractive for outdoor weddings.
  * **Exchange vows on a trim lawn backed by trees and rolling fairways.** A lovely wooden arch is easily transformed by flowers, tulle or even pine boughs. The luscious greenery here creates a secluded, natural vibe—you can almost imagine you're getting married in a quiet mountain meadow.
  * **Sip cocktails in the bar area of the welcoming, fieldstone-faced clubhouse** before transitioning to your reception in the spacious Granada Room. With its unadorned white walls, this room easily adapts to your event theme and color scheme. Light streams in through floor-to-ceiling windows during the day, while a chandelier hanging from the high ceiling provides illumination at night.
