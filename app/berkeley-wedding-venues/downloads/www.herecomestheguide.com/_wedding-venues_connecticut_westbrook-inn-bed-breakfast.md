## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * ****All-inclusive, intimate weddings******are the specialty of this charming vintage Inn.** From sweet riverside elopements**** to weekend-long retreats complete with cozy lodging and breakfast for 20 of your nearest and dearest, their packages' generous inclusions and clear pricing keep planning stress-free.
  * **Say your vows beneath a rustic arbor overlooking the river,** or in a Victorian**** gazebo**,** surrounded by the Inn’s lush greenery. Intimate celebrations move to the charming, garden-style Great Room, while larger groups can opt for the Carriage House, complete with a polished pine interior, open-raftered ceiling, and tons of natural light streaming in through large windows.
  * ****Nestled in the quaint waterfront town of Westbrook,**** the Inn has served as a resting spot for travelers since 1876. Its location couldn't be better, with the picturesque harbor and sandy beach just a short walk away. You can even borrow one of the Inn’s bikes or kayaks for an unforgettable day on the water!
