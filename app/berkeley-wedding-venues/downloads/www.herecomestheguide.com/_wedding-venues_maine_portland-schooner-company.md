## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set a course for romance on an elegant vintage schooner from this unique fleet,** all of which were designed and built right in Maine, representing the state’s rich shipbuilding heritage. (Two of the collection are even listed on the National Register of Historic Places!)
  * **Choosing your favorite from so many stunning boats will be your biggest challenge—** options include the intimate, elopement-perfect Heart’s Desire, with its heart-topped sail, and the sleek 1912 beauty Wendameen, which can host larger parties.
  * **Sail the waters of Casco Bay as you celebrate,** catching sight of its islands, sea life, and historic forts. All cruises embark at piers along Portland’s bustling waterfront, so guests have ample lodging, dining, and entertainment options within walking distance.
