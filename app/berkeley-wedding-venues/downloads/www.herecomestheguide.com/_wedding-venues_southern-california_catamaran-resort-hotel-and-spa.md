## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set along the shores of Mission Bay,** this tropical resort surrounds your day with ocean views, lush palms, and island-inspired serenity. You can say “I do” on the private beach, in a waterfront garden, or under a thatched-roof gazebo beside a koi pond—each spot offering a front-row seat to the coastal scenery.
  * **Their all-inclusive packages simplify planning** with expert coordination, curated menus, tables and linens, and overnight stays just steps from the celebration. With indoor ballrooms, breezy patios, and waterfront lawns to choose from, your celebration can flow exactly how you envision it, whether you’re hosting a micro wedding or a grand soirée.
  * **Small weddings feel especially magical here** thanks to intimate venues like the Garden Room or bayside terraces, where twinkle lights and fire pits set the mood. We especially love that your guests can turn the weekend into a vacation, with access to the on-site spa, beach cruiser bikes, and sunset cruises from the resort’s own pier.
