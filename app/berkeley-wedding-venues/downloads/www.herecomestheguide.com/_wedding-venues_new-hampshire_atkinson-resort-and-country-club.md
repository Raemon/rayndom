## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You get to exchange vows in a romantic setting.** At the Gazebo ceremony site, you’ll say “I do” while guests seated on the terraced lawn enjoy views of the koi pond and cascading waterfalls. The Trellis site, situated amid cobblestone pathways, stone walls and greenery, is equally lovely.
  * **The resort offers a variety of reception options.** The Legacy Ballroom can be divided into the Farview and Brookside Rooms, and each space features fabulous views through floor-to-ceiling windows of the rolling green fairways, beautiful landscaping, and the pond. A more intimate option is the Tuscany Ballroom, with its own trellised ceremony area and private patio.
  * **A wide range of wedding packages allows you to choose what best suits your needs.** You also have a choice of dressing rooms where you and your wedding party can get ready—the one you select may open directly onto a ballroom and have a private balcony—the perfect place to throw your bouquet or make a toast.
