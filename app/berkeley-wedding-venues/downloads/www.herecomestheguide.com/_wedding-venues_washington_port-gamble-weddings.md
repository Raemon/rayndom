## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **From its bluff-top location at the tip of the Kitsap Peninsula,** this extraordinary spot presents a stellar panorama of the Hood Canal and Port Gamble Bay. Photos are a dream here, with beautifully manicured gardens and two exquisite venues that may be rented separately, or as a pair.
  * **St. Paul’s Church is an utterly charming Victorian chapel,** perfect for vows and intimate receptions. Built in 1879 and modeled after a country church in Maine, it looks as if it’s been lifted from a vintage postcard, with its graceful arched windows and classic white “gingerbread" embellishments. 
  * **The Hood Canal Vista Pavilion offers a space for grand receptions,** with a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace and tons of windows that bring in views of the gardens. For warm-weather weddings there’s a majestic ceremony lawn overlooking the water, as well as a tented terrace.
