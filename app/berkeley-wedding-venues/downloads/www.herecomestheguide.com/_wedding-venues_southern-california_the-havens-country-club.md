## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Old World romance, rich history, and plenty of California charm** are the hallmarks of this unique country club, nestled in a quiet valley of northern San Diego County. There are no "cookie cutter" weddings here—the staff delights in each couple's individual style and story, and is devoted to helping you use their uncommonly special spaces to create an event that feels exclusively "you".
  * **Elaborate and authentic 18th-century gates open to reveal the extraordinary Provence Gardens.** Ceremonies here are held beneath a wooden pergola with stone columns, and guests look on from a lawn area bordered by towering timbers, which date back to the 1780s, when George Washington ordered them for the construction of naval ships. Attached shade sails add to guest comfort... and seem to continue the maritime tradition.
  * **The Mission Revival-style Clubhouse is reminiscent of a traditional Mediterranean abbey,** with huge wood doors, soaring archways, and a pale stone exterior. The interior is just as stunning—the two-story ballroom is filled with incredible European-inspired details: an open-raftered ceiling, tiered wrought-iron candelabra chandeliers, delicate wall sconces, impressive tapestries, and an intricately carved wood fireplace that serves as a frame for your sweetheart table.
