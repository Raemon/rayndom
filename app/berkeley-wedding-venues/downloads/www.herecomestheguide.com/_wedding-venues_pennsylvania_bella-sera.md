## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Inspired by a classic Tuscan villa,** this private events venue is truly a one-stop shop for perfect parties, with everything you need—catering, prep suites, indoor and outdoor spaces, and coordination—all under one gorgeous roof. 
  * **The ballroom is spectacular,** with a soaring ceiling with recessed lighting, a towering stone fireplace, and a grand staircase that leads to a balcony that's just begging for a bouquet toss. 
  * **Outside, you'll find The Gardens at Bella Sera,** where you can wed beside a sparkling pond accented by a waterfall, fountain, and lush gardens. Follow with cocktails on the lawn, and a reception beneath a festive tent.
