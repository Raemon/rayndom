## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's a stately Colonial Revival/Georgian mansion just outside Boston.** Within its 25 lovingly restored rooms, you'll find 11 fireplaces, period furnishings, impressive works of art, Italian marble fireplaces, oriental carpeting, and an open floor plan especially designed for entertaining.
  * **There are wonderful outdoor ceremony options across the estate's 18 rolling acres** : under a gorgeous tree, on the pillared portico, and beneath the large tiered gazebo. 
  * **Indoor weddings flow beautifully through the rooms of the mansion's first floor.** Guests can mingle in the Mirrored Parlor and Music Room, dine and dance in the stunning Ballroom, and cozy up for an after-dinner cocktail in the Library.
