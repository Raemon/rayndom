## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Savor picture-perfect countryside views** from every corner of this pretty farm, which sits conveniently between Raleigh and Charlotte on manicured rolling pastures peppered with mature trees. We’re big fans of the romantic covered bridge, which is perfect for “first look” photos.
  * **Wed beneath a pergola beside the 30-acre lake,** or host an intimate reception on the covered patio, followed by cocktails and games on the nearby lawn. Both large and small celebrations work well in the bright, modern barn, whose many fab highlights include a mezzanine, ample indoor and outdoor seating, and a dedicated stage. 
  * **The dressing suites are next-level:** one boasts three separate rooms with floor-length mirrors in each, beautiful natural light, and a posh, comfortable sitting area, while the other is a large, lodge-inspired space with fun features like a pool table and access to a skeet shooting range.
