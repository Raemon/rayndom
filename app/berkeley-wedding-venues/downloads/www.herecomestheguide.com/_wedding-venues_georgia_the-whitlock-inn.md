## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This graceful turn-of-the-century estate** exudes Victorian charm and sophisticated romance. The private courtyard, wraparound veranda, and expansive gardens offer a magnificent backdrop for your al fresco celebration: say "I do" beneath a rose arbor or a quaint gazebo, then dine and dance in the landscaped courtyard, framed by bountiful jonquils, crepe myrtles, wisteria, hydrangeas, and begonias.
  * **Artfully restored interiors include a stately grand ballroom** and three parlor rooms, centered around lovely original fireplaces and anchored by antique Parisian chandeliers. French doors open onto the elegant brick staircase that leads to the courtyard, creating a dreamy indoor/outdoor flow.
  * **Generous all-inclusive packages were designed with your dream day in mind.** Gracefully appointed dressing suites, thoughtful day-of assistance, and complimentary parking are included in every rental, while delectable menus are customized to your taste and style—opt for a strolling reception dinner for a garden party-style soiree!
