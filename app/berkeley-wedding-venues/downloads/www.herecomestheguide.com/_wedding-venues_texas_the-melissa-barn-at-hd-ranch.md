## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Acres of pristine farmland create a tranquil, nature-centered backdrop** at this family-run ranch. With mature trees, a charming rustic-modern outdoor ceremony space, and plenty of room to spread out, it’s a fantastic option for your North Texas celebration.
  * **The barn is simply stunning,** with walls of multi-hued reclaimed wood, a floor-to-ceiling stacked stone fireplace, polished concrete flooring, and romantic, vintage-inspired lighting. Large doors open to airy patios, allowing the celebration to flow onto the pretty grounds.
  * **The Main House provides accommodation for twelve overnighters.** While away the days by the pool, play some games of billiards or ping pong, and gather together for meals on the inviting covered porch.
