## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s in the heart of Philadelphia’s Arts district.** Like its name suggests, the ballroom is just off the Avenue of the Arts, Philly’s go-to spot for culture, dining, shopping, and hospitality.
  * **The 1920s-inspired architecture is lovely.** Sweeping staircases, graceful arches, sparkling chandeliers, and even a Juliet balcony from which to toss your bouquet make the Arts Ballroom a Deco dream.
  * **They only allow one event per day, so you have exclusive use** of two different and gorgeous rooms. For larger functions, check out the stately Sylvania Cocktail Room or Grand Hall. More intimate affairs will be right at home in the swanky lounge. You can also combine a larger room with a smaller one for a fun, dynamic feel.
