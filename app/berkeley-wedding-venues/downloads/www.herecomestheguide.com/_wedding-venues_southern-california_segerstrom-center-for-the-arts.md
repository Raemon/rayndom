## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **If all the world is a theater, then why not have your wedding on one of its most beautiful stages?** The Segerstrom Center for the Arts, located in the heart of the Costa Mesa theater and arts district (and just a short drive from miles of pristine beaches), is a spectacular complex anchored by two magnificent theater buildings joined by an expansive plaza. Collectively, the center offers a multitude of superb options, not just for ceremonies and receptions, but for engagement or rehearsal dinners, as well as any other private events you can think of.
  * **The Renée and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall** —perhaps the center’s most recognized building—is an architectural masterpiece with its 300-foot-long undulating glass façade and soaring lobby, complete with polished granite floor and circular staircase. Brides can truly make a showstopping entrance here, as they descend the stairs beneath a stunning chandelier made of 300 individual pendants tipped with Baccarat crystal globes. Adjustable LED lighting enables you to set the mood to match your theme or décor.
  * **For a more intimate ceremony and reception,** reserve the Samueli Theater, which has its own separate entrance. Its elegant two-story lobby conveys a sense of drama to arriving guests, while the theater itself presents a warm, neutral interior with a hardwood floor that lets you stage your event in a variety of ways. Here, too, special lighting effects can enhance the look and feel you want to achieve.
  * **Also within the concert hall, Leatherby’s Café Rouge is a sleek setting for a sophisticated reception or rehearsal dinner.** At this restaurant, which has been rated “excellent” by the _Los Angeles Times,_ guests will enjoy the impeccable services of Patina Catering, the exclusive caterer for all the event sites at the center. Patina Catering offers the signature cuisine of its founder Joachim Splichal, hailed as a “legendary chef” by _Bon Appetit_ and included among the nation’s “Top 50 Culinarians” by _Nation’s Restaurant News._
  * **Throughout the center there are numerous additional outdoor spaces and smaller venues to consider,** including various terraces, lobbies and the grand plaza, which can be tented or sectioned off for privacy. Wherever you choose to hold your special occasion in this striking cultural enclave, you’re sure to hit a high note. And long after the curtain closes on your class act, you can celebrate many anniversaries at what has been called “a beautiful beacon for the arts” in Orange County.
