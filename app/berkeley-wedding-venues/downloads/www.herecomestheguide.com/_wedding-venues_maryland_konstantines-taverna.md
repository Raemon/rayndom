## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The family that owns and operates this beloved Greek restaurant have been its stewards** since the early 1960s, when it began life as a market in downtown Washington D.C. Now tucked inside a charming vintage home with park-like grounds, it’s a gracious, relaxed setting for weddings of all sizes. 
  * **Celebrate year-round with a host of awesome indoor and outdoor event spaces,** among them: two airy and elegant dining rooms, a covered patio overlooking the beautiful grounds, and a spacious tent beside the pond. 
  * **All the Greek favorites—souvlaki, spanakopita, gyros, and more—** populate the menu, and are sure crowd pleasers. There are also plenty of vegetarian and vegan options, and you can add classic Mediterranean desserts alongside your traditional wedding cake.
