# Colorful Wedding Ideas

## Tie the knot in technicolor!

**While the neutral wedding color palette is still going strong, fashion-forward couples are now embracing bold, vibrant hues and quirky, contemporary details!** These colorful weddings are giving us life, so we've rounded up a few of our favorite non-floral trends that are giving weddings a fresh pop of color.

## Bold Patterns + Prints

[NXT Level Creative](https://www.ashleydeoleo.com/) | [Robert Hacman Photography](https://www.roberthacman.com/) | [Nüage Designs](https://nuagedesigns.com/)

**Bold prints can liven up any décor element** —from colorfully-patterned table linens and wedding backdrops to fine china and even napkins. And of course, we're huge fans of sporting smart prints and patterns on your wedding-day attire. _Swoon!_

* * *

## Vibrant Murals

**If you gravitate toward statement-making modern art** , host your wedding in an [art gallery](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/type/art-gallery) or [museum](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/type/museum), or make use of nearby murals as the background for your ceremony—and of course, your wedding photos!

* * *

## Color-Pop Ceremony Arches

**Bring on the wedding eye candy in the form of statement-making arches!** Custom backdrops in various shapes and colors lend a thoroughly modern vibe to the ceremony. Because there's no better way to frame your I DOs than in living color.

* * *

## Vivid Neon Signs

**If you want vibrant color to electrify your wedding décor, what better way to do it than with a neon sign?** Couples are giving new meaning to the term "lit" by putting their signage up in lights. Whether it's a "crazy in love" illumination or a simple monogram, neon signs are sure to amp up the ambience.

* * *

## Variegated Paper Goods

**Weaving a kaleidoscopic spectrum of colors through your wedding paper goods is a fun way to tie everything together** —from your invitations and save-the-dates to your programs and place cards. We also love the idea of stringing bright paper banners or papel picado throughout the event space!

* * *

## Smoke Bombs

**Perhaps our favorite way of injecting a rainbow of color into your nuptials is with smoke bombs.** Besides being a cool addition to photos, you can also consider using them to accent an outdoor ceremony recessional. Just think: your first kiss as newlyweds, a burst of beautiful colors, and the _most_ _extra_ walk back down the aisle. We are here for it!

* * *

## Zesty Themes

[NXT Level Creative](https://www.ashleydeoleo.com/) | [Robert Hacman Photography](https://www.roberthacman.com/) | [Nüage Designs](https://nuagedesigns.com/)

Whether it's Carnivale-inspired, a neon throwback to the 80's, or a [rainbow spectrum to shout out your Pride](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/lgbtq-pride-wedding-ideas), **a vibrant theme is a natural way to splash color throughout your celebration!** #tropiclikeitshot

* * *

## Ribbons and Streamers

[Nate Messarra Photography](https://www.natemessarra.com/) | [Kat Creech Events](http://www.katcreechevents.com/)

**Ribbons and streamers are an inexpensive way to jazz up just about anything at your wedding**. From draping them across ceremony chairs and weaving them in bouquets to hanging them as backdrops, the polychromatic possibilities are endless.

* * *

## Displays + Signage

[Mary Costa Photography](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-vendors/category/photography/southern-california/mary-costa-photography)

From colorful escort cards and place cards to seating charts and welcome signs...**there are so many opportunities to brighten up your wedding displays.** We're partial to color blocking and ombre organization.

* * *

## Tablescapes + Chairs

[La Tavola Fine Linen Rental](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-vendors/category/linens-wedding-decor-rentals/northern-california/la-tavola-fine-linen-rental) | Studio EMP | [Found Vintage Rentals](http://www.foundrentals.com/)

**Even in the most monochromatic setting, a deliciously-saturated display of table linens and chairs will invariably liven up the space.** Bonus for the matching throw pillows!

* * *

## Balloon Installations

[Jasmine Norris Photography](https://www.jasminenorris.com/) | [Banzi Balloons + Events](https://www.banzi.events/) | [Nerdy Fox Rentals & Designs](https://nerdyfoxrentals.com/) | [Love Light Events](https://lovelighteventsllc.com/)

**A multicolored balloon installation is a real showstopper** —and an epic way to add color to the space. But what we really love is that many companies are now using natural latex for their balloons, making them fully biodegradable and eco-friendly.

* * *

## Glow Favors

[Virginia Photos and Films](https://www.virginiaphotosandfilms.com/) | [Wendy Bernard Makeup Artist](https://www.facebook.com/wendybernardmakeupartist/)

**Light up the night with a luminescent glow!** Turn your reception into a full-fledged party by flicking on the black lights, turning up the EDM, and passing out glow-in-the-dark favors. From colorful glow-stick bracelets to neon sunglasses, you can _glow crazy_ on the dance floor.
