## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **After planning their own children's weddings, the owners****of this serenely verdant venue** returned to their hometown and created a memorable locale, where they can help couples enjoy a stress-free start to married life. 
  * **This 25-acre property boasts wide-open spaces and big Texas views.** With lots of foliage and dramatic wind sculptures, you'll find very little need for extra flowers or décor, which is definitely a budget saver. 
  * **Make your entry down a stone path and exchange vows in front of a bower of trees.** Then mingle over cocktails at the covered Pavilion. Dine here, or head indoors to the Reception Hall, which features a cross-beamed ceiling and lots of windows.
