## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's a lush, secluded retreat.** This traditional New England-style house built in the 1920s is set on a hilltop surrounded by 22 acres of woodland. The spacious lawns and fields lined with trees create a gorgeous natural backdrop for an outdoor ceremony.
  * **You can take the long weekend to relax.** You'll have the entire site to yourself Thursday through Tuesday. Your friends and family can stay with you in the eight-bedroom house, which is filled with antiques and features a living room with oversized fireplace, a library, and a dining room that seats 20. There's even a pool! 
  * **The hardwood floor dance hall, located down a stone path** , features an exposed-beam ceiling that looks especially charming strung with market lights. And the neighboring organic farm can provide fresh, seasonal produce for you and your guests.
