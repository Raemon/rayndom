## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Situated right on the Cabrillo Marina, this fabulous waterfront hotel** is the perfect sun-kissed setting for your Los Angeles nuptials... and so much more. Are you considering a rehearsal dinner, farewell brunch, shower, or cocktail cruise? You can host them here. Planning to stay overnight? There are special accommodations for you and your new spouse, plus lodging for all your guests. 
  * **At the gorgeous Marina View Courtyard,** you can tie the knot and dance and dine on a broad, paved piazza framed by flowers, palms, and other lush greenery. For something more intimate, opt for the Intimate Madeo Plaza, with its Old World-style sconces and strings of bistro lights illuminating the airy nook after the sun sets.
  * **The plein air settings can also be paired with the hotel's elegant indoor spaces.** The Rose Terrace pairs well with the adjacent Marina Room for drinks and hors d'oeuvres and the Bosanko Room for dinner. The much larger Madeo Ballroom located upstairs and the smaller Madeo Room be used individually or in tandem with the other galleries and courtyards for a custom setup.
