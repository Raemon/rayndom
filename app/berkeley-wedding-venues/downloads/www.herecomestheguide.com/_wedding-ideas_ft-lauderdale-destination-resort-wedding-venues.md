# 11 Standout Destination Wedding Venues on the Ft Lauderdale Coast

## 

**If you want your wedding to have a taste of the tropics, head for Fort Lauderdale.** Not only will you find pristine beaches, swaying palm trees and nonstop sun, the town boasts an average temperature of 77 blissful degrees year-round! Honeymooning from here is a snap, too, because the city’s Port Everglades is one of the busiest cruise-ship ports in the world. But before you dash off to the Caribbean, Mexico or another destination, consider spending some quality time with your new spouse at one of the following fabulous Fort Lauderdale wedding venues where you can tie the knot _and_ have an amazing vacation.
