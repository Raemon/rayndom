## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With a pretty, lush setting and accessible location** (just a quick drive south from Baltimore), this stately Greek Revival home offers an intimate feel and big historic charm. It’s owned and operated by the city of Laurel’s parks department, who oversee its use and ensure its preservation. 
  * **You’ll find sweet and photo-friendly vintage touches throughout the home**(three separate formal ballrooms, a quaint enclosed porch, a kitchen with a cozy fireplace), as well as two light-filled dressing suites.
  * **They specialize in small gatherings,** with tailored packages that offer use of the indoor ballrooms, outdoor spaces, or a combination of the two. Plus, your rental fee helps support the Laurel Parks Department in the upkeep of this and other treasured local resources.
