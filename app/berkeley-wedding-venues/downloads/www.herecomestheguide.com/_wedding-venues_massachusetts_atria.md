## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This beautiful Cape Cod-style Captain's house** sits in the heart of charming Edgartown, and features oversized windows, cheerful clapboard siding, and a roof topped with a traditional widow's walk.
  * **Spring and summer ceremonies are beautiful on the lawn** , which is surrounded by a white picket fence and sheltered by an ancient Linden tree. Follow with open-air cocktails on the grass, and a reception on the tented patio.
  * **The Brick Cellar Bar is ready for your afterparty** —with its exposed brick walls, warm wood paneling, and cozy bench seating, guests can't help but settle in and linger a little longer.
