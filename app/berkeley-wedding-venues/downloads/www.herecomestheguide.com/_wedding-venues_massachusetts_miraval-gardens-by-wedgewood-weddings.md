## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Lush forested gardens, stylish facilities, and customizable all-inclusive packages** make this all-season private event hideaway an easy choice…especially when you consider that it’s less than an hour from the heart of Boston. 
  * **A winding brick pathway leads to your serene ceremony garden,** where you’ll exchange vows beneath an elegant white pergola or quaint gazebo. After capturing romantic photos atop a footbridge that spans a koi pond, join your guests on the bluestone patio for a champagne toast among the cozy lounge furnishings, fire pit, and gently trickling waterfall.
  * **The clean, simple lines of the contemporary ballroom** are complemented by**** a creamy, understated color palette. Warmed by three fireplaces, your guests dine and dance beneath 16-foot ceilings while a glass wall frames the scenic grounds.
