## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its breathtaking vista of Diamond Head,** this unique event space—situated on the rooftop pool deck of the Queen Kapiʻolani Hotel—offers guests a bird’s eye view of the iconic Hawaiian peak in an elegant, gracious atmosphere.
  * **The light-filled ballroom** **boasts an airy, contemporary, island-influenced vibe,** and a huge picture window for taking in the stunning panorama. Floor-to-ceiling sliding glass door open to the airy Lanai, a perfect spot for welcome cocktails, a ceremony, or sunset-gazing. 
  * **They offer comprehensive packages** that make long-distance planning a breeze, as well as the option for venue-only rentals if you’d prefer a more hands-on approach. And since it’s nestled right in a fantastic hotel, finding guest lodging is a snap, too.
