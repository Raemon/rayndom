## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With the charm of a classic summer camp and the elegance of Maine’s natural beauty,** this lakeside retreat surrounds you with pine woods, a quiet waterfront, sprawling meadows, and rustic gathering spaces, setting a dreamy backdrop for vows by the water and golden-hour portraits under the trees.
  * **Your evening can unfold beautifully** with cocktails and yard games on the lawn, then dinner in the Function Hall, and a final party in the nearby Concert Hall. Weekend-long rentals include the ability to host a casual Friday welcome cookout in the lakeside pine grove picnic area... the options are endless!
  * **On-site cabins keep everyone close.** Turn the celebration into a full weekend getaway: You might lean into the camp vibe with a friendly game of volleyball or swimming in the lake, or let the exquisite natural surroundings take center stage with a campfire under the stars.
