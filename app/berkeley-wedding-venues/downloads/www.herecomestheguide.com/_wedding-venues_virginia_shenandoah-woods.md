## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tranquil countryside views abound at this peaceful retreat** in the Shenandoah Valley, where you'll see nothing for miles save rolling pastures, lush woodlands, and the Blue Ridge and Massanutten Mountains.
  * **Exchange vows in the pretty Ceremony Grove** , followed by a reception in the fantastic open-sided Pavilion. There's plenty of room on the adjacent lawn for games, and a fire pit for after-dark s'mores.
  * **Up to 100 guests can stay overnight in one of 19 on-site vacation rentals** , which range from the adorable "Little Bitty Cabin" to the grand Colonial Revival Joseph House.
