## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Year-round adventure and breathtaking beauty can be found at this historic site,** tucked at the center of a 1,200 acre reserve at the base of Mount Cardigan. Owned and stewarded by the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC), it boasts an array of photo-friendly natural backdrops, and a conveniently accessible location, just under two hours from Boston. 
  * **Wed in a wildflower meadow beside the pond, or in a forest “cathedral” of towering pines.** The spacious lawn beside the Lodge has plenty of room for games and cocktails, and inside, you’ll find a welcoming space with large windows, a fireplace, a wood-beamed ceiling, and an attached deck which is easily tented in the event of showers.
  * **Host a weekend long (or longer!) party with all your guests on site—** there are accommodations for over 160 folks, between the private rooms and shared bunk rooms of the Lodge, and a collection of individual and group campsites.
