## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Say "I do" with a lake view at this peaceful outdoor venue in Umatilla,** conveniently located**** just outside Mount Dora and near Orlando. Graced with a sparkling lake, open gardens, and lush oak trees across the expansive property, it's a space that feels both intimate and grand... and easy to picture filled with your favorite people.
  * **Couples can exchange vows in the garden, beneath a canopy of trees,** or beside the greenery-fringed lake, then gather for an al fresco reception on the poolside terrace. Two private dressing suites provide you and your parties a lovely space to relax and enjoy the day as it comes together.
  * **Their flexible, build-your-own approach to planning gives you plenty of freedom,** with DIY, all-inclusive, and curated packages available. The setting works beautifully with various styles, whether you're envisioning something classically romantic, whimsically playful, or entirely unique. Plus, as part of a working tree farm, sustainability is woven into the venue's mission.
