  * **With its lush, forested setting, colorful gardens, and enchanting walking paths,** this secluded venue is a nature-loving couples'—and their photographer's—dream. 
  * **The ceremony area is just spectacular,** nestled beneath a canopy of towering trees and boasting a hand-hewn wooden arbor and lovely, rustic wooden benches. 
  * **Dine and dance beneath the stars at your tented reception,** where you'll find a patio strung with romantic bistro lights and an antique firehouse door as your timeless backdrop.
