## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked into a pretty hillside** and surrounded by the Mother Myric, Scallop, and Green Mountain ranges, this secluded, private venue offers one of the loveliest settings in southern Vermont.
  * **At the top of one of the open meadows,** you’ll find your idyllic ceremony spot. Set with a rustic arbor and handmade wooden benches, the site is dappled with shade from nearby trees, and overlooks the vast valley and mountains. 
  * **The restored vintage barn is an absolute dream,** with rough-hewn lumber, exposed rafters, and a second-floor deck that makes an awesome cocktail area. Traditional sliding doors open to the expansive outdoor area, offering even more space for your festivities.
