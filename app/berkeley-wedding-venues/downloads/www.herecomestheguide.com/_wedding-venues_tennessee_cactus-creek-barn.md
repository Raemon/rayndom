## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Pristine Cactus Creek runs through this charming property,** which was owned by the same couple for nearly 50 years. Now a new family has been entrusted with its “legacy of love”, and those who wed here contribute to its history by leaving a note written on a stone as a blessing to future couples.
  * **Choose any place you love on the property to host your ceremony…** you really can’t go wrong: whether you settle on a creekside spot, a forest clearing, a covered pavilion, the pretty “heart tree”, or in front of the classic barn, you’re guaranteed a picture-perfect memory. 
  * **The barn is ideally laid out for receptions,** with romantic string lighting, a wooden bar, covered patios, a stone fire pit, and a prayer garden with its own waterfall. An in-house collection of fun props—whiskey barrels, mason jars, and even a cowboy bathtub for serving drinks—helps round out the gracious, rustic vibe.
