## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled in the inviting Groves neighborhood of Northern Mesa** , this freshly renovated Victorian estate is loaded with vintage charm. The high-gabled mansion is inset with beautiful stained-glass windows, and has a quaint exterior spiral staircase. In the grand ballroom, magnificent crystal chandeliers shimmer from the vaulted ceiling, so your reception simply glows with nostalgic glamour. 
  * **The wedding garden is a truly magical place for a ceremony.** Couples have a choice of two enchanting ceremony spots—an intricate wooden gazebo or a refreshing water-wall. Meanwhile, guests relax on the brick-paver patio beneath bistro lights or on the spacious gingerbread-trimmed wraparound porch.
  * **This private, storybook venue may seem upscale, but the price isn't!** Wedgewood Weddings is known for providing fully customizable wedding packages to best accommodate your budget and wedding vision. Less stress + lower cost = more fun!
