## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set atop a hill and boasting dreamy views** of its iconic namesake castle-shaped butte in the distance, this Castle Rock gem features lovely event spaces and amenities, including two posh dressing suites and the Speakeasy Game Room, which is tricked out with a pool table, dart board, and an awesome vintage bar. 
  * **Ceremony sites offer a peaceful, natural vibe** with mature native trees and lush landscaping. The ballroom sets the scene for a festive, elegant soiree, with cool design elements like rich wood and iron, wraparound windows, and vaulted ceilings hung with circular chandeliers. 
  * **We’re absolutely smitten with the ultra-glam Oak Room,** the club’s Art Deco-inspired cocktail lounge. The perfect space for cocktail hour or an after-party gathering, it features sleek retro lighting and soft lounge seating that encourages guests to nestle in with the perfect martini.
