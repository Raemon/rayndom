## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Intimate weddings are exquisite in this Georgian mansion.** Inside, you'll find a grand spiral staircase, period art and furnishings, and beautiful natural light streaming through dozens of windows. 
  * **The newly-refurbished Stable hosts larger events.** The perfect blend of rustic and elegant, it features a high, open-raftered ceiling, a silo, and a covered porch overlooking the estate's pristine 121 acres.
  * **Treat yourself to a private retreat for the weekend** when you rent out the mansion for you and your closest friends. It has five luxurious bedrooms, including two that are perfect for bride & groom dressing suites.
