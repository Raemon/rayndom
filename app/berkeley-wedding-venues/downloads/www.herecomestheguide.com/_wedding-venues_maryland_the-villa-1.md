## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With crystal chandeliers, a tray ceiling, neutral color scheme** , and a one-of-a-kind uplighting system, the Grand Ballroom can easily be transformed to suit your wedding vision. And for a romantic ambiance, just add votive candles (included) and dim the lights!
  * **The Renaissance Suite gives you the option of an indoor/"outdoor" celebration.** In addition to Mediterranean-style interior spaces that work well for cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, it features a climate-controlled tent with parquet flooring and event lighting, which is ideal for dining and dancing. 
  * **The Villa offers full day-of coordination services** , and their private planning website enables you to see the details of your event as it develops.
