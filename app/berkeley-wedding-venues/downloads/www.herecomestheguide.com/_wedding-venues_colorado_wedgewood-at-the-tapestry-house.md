## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Loaded with historic charm, this replica of a Victorian mansion** was crafted in the famed Queen Anne "painted lady" style, using salvaged pieces from the original structure. The playful architecture and nostalgic fixtures contrast with the modern twinkle-lit reception pavilion, giving the entire estate a timeless appeal.
  * **Gorgeous gardens feature fragrant, seasonal foliage** like lilac and honeysuckle, as well as a wedding-white gazebo. During the coldest months, the property’s 40 majestic trees are dusted with snow for a quintessential "winter wonderland." To memorialize the occasion, you and your beloved will place a personalized brick with your names and wedding date on the grounds. 
  * **Wedgewood Weddings' fully customizable, inclusive wedding packages** are money-savers and stress-busters. They provide so much for a reasonable cost, and will personalize your wedding details to suit your vision!
