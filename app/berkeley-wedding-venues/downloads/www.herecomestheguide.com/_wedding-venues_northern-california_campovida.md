## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Twelve acres of enchanting blooms, native plantings, and organic vegetable and herb gardens** encircle this beautiful, family-owned retreat. In addition to its stunning surroundings, you'll find cozy on-site lodgings perfect for destination getaways: stay with your sweetie in the Honeymoon Cottage, while your loved ones are welcome to stay in a sweet farmhouse and barn-style lodge.
  * **Exchange vows beneath the Learning Arbor, a magnificent arcade** where 12 varietals of fruiting grapevines interlace overhead in a leafy canopy. After the "I do"s, meander along the succulent-lined pathways, pose for pics beneath the gnarled arms of a centuries-old oak or a graceful weeping willow, and delight in the fragrant blossoms of the pear, persimmon, and espaliered apple trees.
  * **A burbling fountain adds Old World elegance to the Tuscan Garden,** where you'll a soaring pavilion-style rotunda entwined with wisteria vines, whose seasonal show of purple blooms literally cascades all around your cocktail hour or reception. Or, opt for a party in the vintage Hop Barn, where the requisite rafters, plank wood floors, and Edison lighting make for an authentically rustic experience.
