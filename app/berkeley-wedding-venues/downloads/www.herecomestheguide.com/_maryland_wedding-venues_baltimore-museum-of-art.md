##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Founded in 1914 with a single painting** , this grand museum now has 95,000 pieces in its collection of 19th-century, modern, and contemporary art—including the largest public holding of works by Henri Matisse.
  * **Weddings can be held in the neoclassical Fox Court** , with its soaring coffered ceiling supported by Ionic columns or Antioch Court, which boasts elaborate mosaics and floor-to-ceiling windows. 
  * **Outdoor celebrations are held in the stunning sculpture garden** , with dining among the sculptures or on the terrace of Gertrude’s Restaurant, which overlooks the museum’s grounds.
