## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With turn-of-the-century charm** , this 100-year-old barn in the White Salmon River Valley is both rustic and elegant. Light from the large chandeliers reflects off the tin ceiling and smooth concrete floor, creating a warm country atmosphere.
  * **Overlooking the apple orchards and Mt. Adams** , the Arbor offers a beautiful outdoor ceremony location. Exchange vows beneath an old English walnut tree amid the hay fields and rolling hills of the valley, with the scent of fresh-cut grass and honeysuckle in the air. 
  * **Vintage dining tables and chairs, leather furnishings** , and a lounge area create a welcoming and authentic ambiance. And they’ve got the details covered, from mismatched china settings and old books to galvanized tubs, lawn games, twinkle lights, and more.
