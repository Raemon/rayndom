## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This beautiful Victorian-era country manor** is surrounded by acres of natural woodlands, flower gardens, and even a koi pond and "Bridge to Forever." Located near downtown St. Joseph, local wineries, and the stunning Lake Michigan beaches, this welcoming, timeless estate proves that hidden gems still exist.
  * **The Fairy Garden lives up to its name—** with its stone walkway, delicate arch, and secluded setting among mature trees and ferns, it gives your ceremony a magical touch. Another option is the charming Pergola, a classic white arbor on a slightly raised stone stage, backed by a row of evergreen trees for year-round lushness.
  * **Follow your vows with an outdoor tented reception** on the expansive lawn or move inside for an intimate dinner in the elegant Riverside Room. The ample selection of in-house décor—which include vintage furnishings, vases, votives, Victorian birdcages, and more—ensures either space can be customized to perfectly fit your vision.
