  * **Rustic charm abounds in this 100-year-old ballroom dance club** , set in Portland’s beautiful Laurelhurst Park. 
  * **The room’s exposed wooden rafters and stone fireplace harken back to the past** , while the open floor plan allows you to configure the space however you wish. 
  * **The surrounding gardens are perfect for an outdoor ceremony.** Take in the serene beauty of the landscape as you say “I Do,” pose for photographs, or enjoy appetizers al fresco.
