## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Originally built by the descendants of John Deere,** these impressive Victorian homes have a history steeped in romance and weddings: Butterworth Center (first known as Hillcrest) was built by her father, Charles Deere, as a nuptial gift for his youngest daughter, Katherine…who met her future husband at the wedding of her sister. 
  * **Ceremonies may be held on the lawn,** with a backdrop of mature trees, or in the Butterworth Center’s opulent library, which can also host intimate receptions. Larger, warm-weather tented celebrations are lovely on the mansion’s private, walled grounds. 
  * **Events here help support the upkeep of the homes and the property that surrounds them,** which serve both the community and the nation as a center for educational and cultural events. The Center’s many offerings include art lectures, concerts, scholarships, school tours, and no-cost day camps.
