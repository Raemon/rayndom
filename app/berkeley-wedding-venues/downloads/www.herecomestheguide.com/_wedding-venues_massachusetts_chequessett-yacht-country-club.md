## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This welcoming, laid-back club is loaded with Cape-style charm** , with traditional shake-shingle siding and tasteful, rustic-chic décor. It’s situated on 106 acres with views of undeveloped woodlands, Wellfleet Harbor, and the Herring River.
  * **Ceremonies can take place on the Club’s private beach.** Make your entrance down a granite seaside stairway, and exchange vows at the water’s edge. Tented decks are available in case of inclement weather.
  * **Choose between two great reception locations.** Enjoy a tented beachfront wedding reception with panoramic views of Wellfleet Bay. The Boathouse, a more casual setting, offers one of the prettiest harbor views in Wellfleet.
