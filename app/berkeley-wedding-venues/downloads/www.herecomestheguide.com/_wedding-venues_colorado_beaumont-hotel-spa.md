## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This 1886 landmark, known as the "‘Flagship of the San Juans,"** offers the perfect combination of vintage elegance and jaw-dropping natural beauty. You might exchange vows on the Victorian split staircase, with your guests watching from the lobby or along the balconies above, or zip up the road for a private exchange of vows amid the spectacular peaks only moments away.
  * **Breathtaking views of the mountains** **and Ouray's historic downtown** surround the stone and red brick courtyard, adding a touch of grandeur to al fresco gatherings. If you're not ready to head back to your suite after dancing under the stars, head right inside to Roosevelt's, a cozy retreat that feels like a welcoming vintage tavern.
  * **Original Gothic stained glass window stud the Old World-inspired ballroom,** which is also adorned with hand-painted plaster walls, rich wood paneling, and antique brass wall sconces. A historic orchestra balcony extends along one wall, creating a great perch for toasts or bouquet tosses.
