## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **Wide open spaces and ancient pecan trees make this private ranch** an extra-pretty setting for celebrations. Whether you dress it up a bit or let the natural surroundings speak for themselves, your photos are guaranteed to be gorgeous. 
  * **Hold your ceremony in one of the quiet meadows** , followed by cocktails in the open-air pavilion. A built-in bar, ceiling fans to keep things cool, and charming umbrella-shaded picnic tables make it great spot for receptions, too.
  * **Indoor events can make use of the Rustic Red Barn** , which boasts traditional sliding doors, fun prop-up windows that create great air flow, and an adjacent "lounge" area created by wraparound benches beneath twinkle-lit trees.
