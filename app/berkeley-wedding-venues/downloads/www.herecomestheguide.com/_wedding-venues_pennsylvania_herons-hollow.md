## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **South Central Pennsylvania’s lush, rolling landscape** surrounds this storybook-perfect, family-run farm. With its sweet traditional barn, open meadows, tranquil pond, and ultra-convenient location, it’s an awesome choice for your rural East Coast destination weekend. 
  * **Wed overlooking the pond, woods, or hills,** then take the paddle boat out for some unforgettable photos while your guests kibitz on the lawn. When it’s time for dinner and dancing, slide open the barn’s large doors to celebrate in twinkle-lit, rustic-elegant style. 
  * **All packages include three days and two nights,** and there are accommodations for up to 30 people across three charming, well-appointed farm buildings. Gather for cookouts on the patios, snuggle around the fire pit, and spend a memorable, relaxing weekend with your favorite people.
