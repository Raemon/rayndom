## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Charmingly rustic and close to nature:** This Hereford cattle farm, which has been operated by the same family for more than 40 years, is set on 50 peaceful and secluded acres of pasture just south of the New Hampshire border. 
  * **Gorgeous meadow ceremony site:** You can exchange vows in a lush green field, with rough-hewn log pews and a wood-frame canopy as the altar. Thick groves of trees surround the pastureland and are especially colorful in the fall.
  * **Enjoy the bounty of the farm:** The grass-fed beef raised at Red Ridge is available for you or one of the local vendors to serve at your reception, and you can also select products such as cupcake and candle holders that are made on site.
