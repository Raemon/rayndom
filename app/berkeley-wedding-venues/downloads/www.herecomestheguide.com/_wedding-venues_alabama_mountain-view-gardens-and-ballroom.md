##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **The mansion and gardens are gorgeous year round.** This stately Victorian home nestled on 11 verdant acres offers a picturesque backdrop, whether it's draped in snow or surrounded by fragrant blooms in warmer weather.
  * **Walls of windows in the grand ballroom** flood the space with natural light and provide a lovely view of the landscaped grounds. The classically styled interior includes a gleaming hardwood floor, sparkling chandeliers, and an intricately coffered ceiling.
  * **There are well-equipped prep areas for both wedding parties.** One suite features a charming round settee, intimate lighting, a large vintage mirror, and a fireplace, while the second space has a pool table, large-screen television, and plenty of comfortable seating.
