## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The cool, modern ballroom has large windows that let in lots of light and city sights.** Artistic touches, like mirrored walls, industrial-inspired lighting, and a blown-glass sculpture at the room’s entrance, add character and style.
  * **You can't top the venue's iconic Portland view:** the sweeping panorama spreads across the Willamette River to the downtown Portland skyline, centered on the famous light-up "Portland, Oregon" sign atop the White Stag Building.
  * **The venue’s exclusive caterer is ranked among Portland’s best** —their extraordinary, creative menus are tailored to each couple, and their intimate knowledge of this unique setting guarantees your event will be smooth and worry-free.
