## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Surrounded by vines and warmed by the golden glow of the Central Coast sunshine,** this pristine private estate and vineyard was custom-built for memorable Wine Country weddings. Set on 28 picturesque acres in Paso Robles, the picturesque surroundings and generous amenities make Bella Terra Vineyard Estate a wonderful all-in-one venue for your ceremony, reception, after-party, and more, with weekend-long lodging available in the on-site manor.
  * **The estate's centerpiece is a stunningly restored equestrian barn,** which boasts a crisp, white interior accented by chic black sliding doors, a double-height ceiling illuminated by bistro lights, and a gleaming poured concrete floor made for dancing. Winding garden paths lead to other gorgeous settings: a wooden bridge crossing a gentle creek, a grassy expanse before the vines, and a wisteria-draped pergola surrounded by landscaped perennial greenery, mature trees, and shaded lawns ideal for al fresco dining.
  * **Let the stately five-bedroom manor house be your home base for a weekend of Wine Country exploration.** Two large king-sized suites sit on opposite sides of the English-inspired mansion—perfectly placed for the wedding parties to prep separately—with three queen-sized suites in between. At the heart of the home is a gleaming chef's kitchen that opens onto a formal living room, and outside, a hot tub and covered patio are perfectly placed for watching the sun set over the valley.
