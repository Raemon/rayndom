  * **The charming town of New Prague** is home to this unique multi-use property. Designed by renowned architect Cass Gilbert, it offers indoor and outdoor gathering areas that artfully blend original vintage details with sophisticated, modern touches. 
  * **Weekend weddings are a breeze, and you'll never have to leave the property.** On Friday,check in to the sleek, boutique hotel before gathering for décor setup and a rehearsal dinner; Saturday, you'll have unlimited access to the property with the freedom to celebrate wherever you choose; finally, opt to host brunch at the on-site restaurant on Sunday morning before departing for your new married life.
  * **Choose your fave space from a collection of gorgeous options,** including an industrial-chic ballroom with loads of natural light, the rustic, glamorous Brick X Lounge, a spacious lawn, a patio made from reclaimed Chicago brick, and a cool speakeasy hidden behind a secret armoire door. The inviting, stylish lodging also invites you to linger, with eight luxe guest rooms, an upper level sitting room, quaint hospitality room, and a second-floor balcony overlooking downtown.
