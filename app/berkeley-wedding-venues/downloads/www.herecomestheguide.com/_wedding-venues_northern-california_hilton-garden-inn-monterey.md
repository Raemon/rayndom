## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

Upon arrival at the Hilton Garden Inn Monterey, you’re likely to say to yourself, “Wow, it’s even nicer than I thought it was going to be!” This distinct sense of having your expectations exceeded continues throughout your time here. The recently renovated hotel is centrally located on a scenic side street forested with mature oaks and Monterey pines. Inside, the stylish Lobby is clad in sleek marble and warm woods. Contemporary furnishings and décor accented with marine blue and a dash of sunny yellow contribute to a luxurious, yet unpretentious, freshness. To the right of the Lobby, a bar and lounge with a cut-stone fireplace is a classy space to relax or mingle. But it’s the genuine, welcoming smiles from all who work here that will most impress, as well as put you at ease during all the planning and celebrating of your special occasion.

Intimate ceremonies gather on a petite lawn. Larger ceremonies can be staged on the Poolside Terrace, which is also a fun place for open-air dining and cocktails. The Terrace has a bird’s-eye view of the sparkling swimming pool and deck, lined with a row of cabanas—great for showcasing gifts or the sweetheart table.

Gala receptions spread out inside the Big Sur, an octagon-shaped ballroom on the second floor, complete with a built-in wooden bar. Multiple windows frame the treetops and a peek-a-boo bay view. A breezeway connects the Big Sur to the smaller Vista Del Mar, which is often used for hors d’oeuvres, cocktails, or dancing. Windows trimmed with louvered shutters look out to the pool and trees. Another party option is the Presidio, a bright, charming room with a cathedral ceiling and eye-catching chandeliers whose glass cylinders are tinged with the colors of the sea. Doors open onto a narrow veranda overlooking the gazebo. With its cheery ambiance, the Presidio is also a popular choice for rehearsal dinners or day-after brunches.

The hotel’s updated accommodations offer plenty of homey amenities—like mini-refrigerators, microwaves and Keurig brewing systems—that make staying here not only convenient but also inviting. The family-friendly restaurant (try the tasty made-to-order breakfast!), a deluxe fitness center, 24-hour business center and complimentary WiFi are other guest-pleasers. And the congenial staff is always happy to direct lodgers to the abundant local attractions.

In fact, they’ve earned a reputation for going out of their way for their customers. Recently, when one couple having their reception at the Hilton Garden Inn Monterey suddenly found themselves without their beach ceremony location on the morning of their wedding, they called the hotel in a panic. The event team rushed into action, arranging a last-minute ceremony on site. That’s just one example of the caring, can-do spirit at the heart of this location’s success.

The hotel has one more pleasant surprise: Affordability. Your event manager is committed to giving you the most for your money—even supplying a complimentary customized web page to coordinate your wedding weekend; courtesy room blocks mean your friends and family will save, too. At the Hilton Garden Inn Monterey, you can wed, dine and stay for much less than you would expect to pay for a memorable Monterey destination wedding.
