## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You'll feel right at home at this intimate boutique winery,** located in the Livermore Valley, one of the country's oldest winemaking regions. In addition to producing a dazzling array of varietals from century-old grapevines, the owners have also created a charming setting where you can celebrate your wedding in style—and have the entire property to yourselves.
  * **A raised, Craftsman-style gazebo bordered by fragrant lavender and silvery shrubs** is the centerpiece of the manicured Ceremony Lawn, where you'll exchange vows. Continue the celebration al fresco in the Garden Courtyard, or opt for an indoor reception in the Barrel Room, where high ceilings, concrete floors, and rows of stacked barrels set a romantic scene.
  * **Your menu will expertly pair exquisite cuisine with wine selections** from the vineyard's much-lauded reds and whites. Perhaps you'll start with a toast, clinking glasses of their signature sparkling wine, and end with snifters of their rich red port, enjoyed beneath the patio's glistening twinkle lights and the spreading stars above.
