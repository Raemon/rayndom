## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

**• All the rural charm of the north Georgia mountains** without the long drive. Couples can enjoy a tree-shaded ceremony in the backyard garden; an open, sunny lawn for the reception; and a country lane just made for photo backdrops—all conveniently located on four acres in the metro-Atlanta area. 

**• This 1920 homestead-turned-manor house,** carefully updated with modern conveniences,**** brings back the days of century-old rural mansions. Also on the property is a white carriage house that’s perfect for dancing, a smokehouse with bright red doors and a rustic bar, and a quaint fire pit for late night s’mores. 

**• The eclectic menu features American and Continental dishes,** as well as plenty of down-home Southern favorites. The talented staff, along with your personal day-of coordinator, will keep the whole event running smoothly, so all you have to do is enjoy it!
