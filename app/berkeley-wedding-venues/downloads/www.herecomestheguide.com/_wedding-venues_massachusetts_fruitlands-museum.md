## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

**• The natural beauty of rural Massachusetts.** You’ll be wowed by stunning views of the Nashoba Valley’s rolling hills, local orchards, hay fields and hardwood forests.

**• The perfect location.** Home of Fruitlands Museum, the historic Prospect House is set atop a hill overlooking the Nashua River Valley, and is a great space to stage your bar, serve appetizers or display your wedding cake. A lovely tent situated on an adjacent brick patio features beautiful chandeliers, removable walls and large windows. The garden and expansive lawns are ideal for outdoor ceremonies. 

**• A menu that reflects the best flavors of each season.** The cuisine is elegantly prepared and thoughtfully presented by Fireside Catering, a company that sources local and sustainable food from area farms and artisan purveyors, including their own Gibbet Hill Farm.
