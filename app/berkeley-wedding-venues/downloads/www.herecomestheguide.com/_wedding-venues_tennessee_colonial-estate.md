##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **With panoramic views of the Smoky Mountains** and the gorgeous Blount County countryside, this beautiful private event venue offers perfect photo ops around every turn, and is just nine miles from the Knoxville airport. 
  * **Exchange vows beneath a traditional gazebo** with the mountains as your backdrop, or opt for the spacious lawn of the classic colonial home. Continue the celebration on the grounds, or move to the pretty, open-sided pavilion. 
  * **Choose from an array of packages** designed to suit every need and budget, from elopement, micro, and weekday affairs to all-inclusive bashes for the longest of guest lists.
