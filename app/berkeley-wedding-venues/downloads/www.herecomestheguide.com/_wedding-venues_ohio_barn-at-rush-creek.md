## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on a peaceful ridge in the enchanting Hocking Hills region,** this welcoming venue**** on 200 private acres is a hidden gem just waiting to be discovered. From intimate elopements to weekend-long retreats, the vibe balances cozy and elevated with ease.
  * **The picturesque ceremony site is****nestled in the shade of a soaring oak tree** and surrounded by pastoral lawns and a sparkling pond. After the “I do”s, the party continues inside the barn, where grand wrought-iron chandeliers glow beneath vaulted rafters.
  * **With two days of access included in every rental,** you’ll have plenty of time to soak in the celebration.**** Overnight accommodations for 16 in the cozy cabin are also included, as are plenty of other fabulous extras: We love the option to stroll over to the on-site winery, which offers a reservable space for a rehearsal dinner after the prep is complete!
