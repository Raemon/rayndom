## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's an absolutely beautiful historic Georgian mansion.** Situated on a knoll overlooking 60 acres of park-like grounds in the Shenandoah Valley, this 1811 treasure has Southern charm in spades. 
  * **Exchange vows beneath the manor's Grand Portico** , with mountain views in the distance. Or, hold a ceremony under the shade of ancient trees on the South Lawn. Follow with a tented reception, or move inside to the rustic-elegant Carriage House.
  * **There are lovely accommodations for up to 75 guests.** In addition to suites in the mansion itself, two guest houses have all the comforts of home, with full kitchens, welcoming common areas, and cozy bedrooms.
