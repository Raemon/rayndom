## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This Provence-like setting is infused with Southern hospitality.** It sits on 23 secluded Texas Hill Country acres overlooking Lac Moise, and offers a variety of indoor and outdoor options for ceremonies and receptions.
  * **An antique French gazebo adds romance to the Green Cathedral.** For larger gatherings, exchange vows under a canopy of stately oak trees at The Grove, where the stone altar has been wired for lighting and acoustics.
  * **The Great Hall transports you to a chateau in the south of France.** A soaring ceiling, exposed beams and crystal chandeliers give the grand space an openness and elegance, while the fireplace, private alcoves and balcony create warmth, visual interest and quiet spots for conversation.
