## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Originally a summer Catskills retreat founded in the early 1900s,** this historic hotel sits on 55 lush acres along the banks of Lake Kenoza and now serves guests year-round with luxury accommodations, fine dining, a full-service spa, and tons of all-season adventure opportunities.
  * **Every celebration space is absolutely gorgeous—** your choices include a lakeside lawn or patio, a graceful peaked sailcloth tent in a field of wildflowers, and an intimate, light-filled dining room with elegant vintage vibes. 
  * **Invite your guests to stay the weekend in the inn's 22 inviting guest rooms and 10 charming bungalows.** The stylish interiors evoke**** a modern-meets-Victorian design aesthetic (our favorite: the Rooftop Deck Suite!), and many boast large soaking tubs and panoramic lake views.
