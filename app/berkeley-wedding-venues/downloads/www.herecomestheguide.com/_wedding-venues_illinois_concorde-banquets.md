## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This beautiful venue is wonderfully private.** The lush grounds and tasteful buildings create the feeling of being on your own secluded estate—you’d never guess it’s only 20 minutes from O’Hare Airport and some of the North Side’s most popular suburbs. 
  * **Exchange vows beneath a white, trellised gazebo at the edge of a lake.** Your photographer will especially love this setting, with its dramatic fountain and graceful swans gliding across the water.
  * **Host your reception in one of their elegant ballrooms** , which feature high, coffered ceilings hung with oversized chandeliers. They even have a sweeping staircase where you can pose for classic wedding photos.
