## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You’ll soak in views for days at this all-season resort.** Though best known for its world-class skiing, this stunning spot—just a quick 90-minute drive from Boston—features unforgettable scenery throughout the year, and stylish facilities that let you celebrate in any weather.
  * **Ceremonies can take place at the summit,** where you’ll be treated to an endless panorama of Lake Sunapee and the White and Green ranges, or on a breezy fieldstone patio at the foot of mountain, beside the resort’s peaceful pond. 
  * **The Lodge's reception space boasts a traditional New England feel,** with rustic post-and-beam construction, a soaring ceiling with a central skylight, and a spacious wraparound mezzanine that overlooks the main floor. No need to make the drive home after the dancing’s done; there are bountiful vacation rentals, hotels, and B&Bs just minutes away.
