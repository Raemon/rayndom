## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Originally built as a private residence,** this charming 1800s farmhouse has been lovingly reinvented as a bespoke event venue, enhanced with everything that makes a celebration perfect, including well-appointed dedicated dressing spaces and a top-notch coordination team. 
  * **The Knoll is your pretty outdoor spot for vows,** set on a lawn nestled against a sprawling tree whose leaves turn a lovely auburn in the fall. It’s accessed by a paved pathway that winds across the grounds, creating wonderful photo opportunities as you stroll toward your ceremony. 
  * **In the Manor Room, the home’s impressive ballroom, you’ll find a cool, rustic-modern space** with shiny polished concrete flooring, a soaring, whitewashed ceiling hung with wrought iron candelabra chandeliers, a dramatic split staircase for grand entrances, and French doors that lead to an inviting wraparound covered porch.
