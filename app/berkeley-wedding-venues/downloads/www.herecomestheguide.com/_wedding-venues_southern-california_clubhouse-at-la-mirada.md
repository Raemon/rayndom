## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Affordable, accommodating, and private, this popular golf course** is beloved for a reason (or many!). Every wedding here is individualized—you'll meet with the welcoming staff for a tasting well before the big day, and because the city of La Mirada is an ethnic crossroads, the facility has extensive experience dealing with different religious and cultural needs.
  * **Say your "I do"s al fresco at the beautiful lakeside gazebo.** Afterwards, mingle with your guests on the spacious terrace, which offers a panoramic view of the golf course fairways that seems to go on for miles.
  * **Dance the night away on the biggest dance floor in town.** In the clubhouse's stylish ballroom, you'll find contemporary crystal chandeliers, windows on three sides, and a romantic shiplap showcase wall, for a stunning photo backdrop.
