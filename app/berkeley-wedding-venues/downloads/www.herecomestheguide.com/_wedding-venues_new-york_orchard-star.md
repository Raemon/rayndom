## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked alongside a tranquil branch of the Delaware River** in the Catskill Mountains, this exquisite 44-acre property showcases the very best of the region, combining pristine natural landscapes, historic architecture, and luxurious accommodations. Two climate-controlled barn venues are gorgeous year-round, with balconies boasting sweeping mountain and orchard views, two lovely get-ready rooms, and an exquisite attention to the details—like the included Riedel glassware and place settings that feature handmade stoneware from regional artisans L’Impatience and Golden Ratiolike.
  * **Exchange vows in the enchanting apple orchard,** then join your guests for an al fresco celebration in the Circadian Garden, a Tuscan-inspired oasis nestled among fragrant sage, lavender, and Asian pear trees. The vows you make here will add another story to the land's rich legacy, which extends from the indigenous people who lived here as far back as 2,000 BCE to John Lennon & Yoko Ono to the current owner, whose passion and clear communication make planning a joy.
  * **The four-bedroom farmhouse is your beautiful home base for the weekend.** Spend your days enjoying the property's quaint pond, wooden rowboat, and hot tub or exploring the adorable nearby towns, then return to your plush lodgings, where you'll enjoy joyous dinners cooked on the LaCanche stove, snuggling in the library before a roaring fire, or watching the sunset from the sweeping porch.
