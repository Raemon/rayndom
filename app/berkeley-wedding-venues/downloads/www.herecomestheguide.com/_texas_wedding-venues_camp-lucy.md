## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled in the idyllic surroundings of a Hill Country ranch** , this quintessential Texas venue is the perfect place for a charming and elegant event.
  * **Three distinctive event sites provide plenty of versatility.** _Ian's Chapel_ features a luminous restored French Colonial chapel, majestic Events Hall, open pavilion, Old World brick-paved courtyard, and an expansive great lawn. At _Sacred Oaks,_ ancient oaks sparkling with thousands of tiny lights create a magical ceremony site. This option also boasts a dramatic timber-framed Great Hall and separate bell tower. For a totally outdoor celebration, host it in _The Vineyard_ next to acres of grapevines. 
  * **Luxury accommodations make an excellent "home base"** for exploring the wineries, breweries, and other local Hill Country attractions. The beautifully crafted Camp Lucy Cottages treat guests to amenities like plush pillowtop mattresses, fine linens, DirectTV satellite, free WiFi, and a complimentary breakfast.
