## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s a charming boutique hotel.** Styled after a French country estate, this delightful property feels both elegant and welcoming. It’s nestled among trees that provide such lovely shade and privacy you may forget you’re just 45 minutes north of Dallas. 
  * **You’ll find beauty indoors and out.** There are two outdoor ceremony sites—one under the covered terrace, and the other a garden area with a custom-built pergola. Inside, there’s a warm, intimate dining room, and vows are exchanged in front of the fireplace. 
  * **The accommodations are gracious and delightful.** Enjoy the full estate experience when you and your guests reserve the 14 comfortable rooms in the Inn. They are decorated in a style unique to a different part of Europe, and all of them feature decadent amenities like luxury linens, a whirlpool tub, plush robes, a balcony, and an individual fireplace.
