## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Built in the 1830s, this stately mansion** has been an integral part of Jersey City’s history. In its more than 140-year lifespan, it has served as a private residence, YMCA facility, performance space, and was even a center of operations during Hurricane Sandy.
  * **The lovingly restored interior boasts opulent period furnishings,** a theater, and several elegant, light-filled event rooms. A favorite photo op for newlyweds: the quaint vintage bowling alley! 
  * **Your rental fees help support the preservation of the mansion** and support its many programs, which include 12-step organizations, arts installations and performances, and educational outreach.
