## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A tree-lined drive leads guests to this secluded 19th-century country estate.** Just 25 minutes from Madison and popular visitor destination Spring Green, it’s home to gorgeous historic farm buildings, a stream, and acres of majestic trees.
  * **Your outdoor ceremony takes place in a tranquil clearing** beneath the boughs of towering oak. There’s a lovely brick patio for cocktail hour, and the vintage gambrel barn, with its soaring, cathedral-like ceiling, is absolutely breathtaking.
  * **An 1850s farmhouse—completely decked out in charming antique furnishings** and boasting a roaring stone fireplace—can sleep up to ten guests, and another eight overnighters can be accommodated in the sweet stream-side cottage.
