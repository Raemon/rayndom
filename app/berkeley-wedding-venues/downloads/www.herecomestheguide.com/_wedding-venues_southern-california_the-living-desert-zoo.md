## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Wed with the wild things at this one-of-a-kind venue,** where you can say “I do” among giraffes, gardens, and glowing desert skies, with a backdrop that feels more like a botanical safari than a traditional wedding location.
  * **Four stunning ceremony sites and four reception venues offer tons of flexibility**. For example, you might wed on an elevated platform beside the giraffe habitat or among the inventive sculptures of the Irvine Patio… then, opt to dine al fresco among the palms or in the sleek Bighorn Café, where walls of windows offer views of the impressive Bighorn Mountain and its resident sheep.
  * **Intimate celebrations are sure to find a perfect fit** in the Stephen B. Chase Building, which includes a stylish Boardroom, a stunning art gallery and reception hall, and an adjacent patio, beautifully landscaped and highlighted by a sculptural waterfall.
