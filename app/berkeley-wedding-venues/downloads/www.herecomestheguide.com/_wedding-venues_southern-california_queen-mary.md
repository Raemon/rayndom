## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Completed in 1936, this legendary ship has a storied history of unparalleled luxury and elegance.** Now permanently docked in Long Beach Harbor, this ocean liner-turned hotel attraction will take your breath away and transport you to another era—without ever setting sail.
  * **Panoramas of the marina, ocean, downtown Long Beach, and an occasional pod of dolphins** surround your al fresco ceremony on the Long Beach Vista Deck or Capstan Deck. After saying "I do", linger over cocktails to soak up the lovely harbor views as the sunset colors the sky, before heading inside for your reception.
  * **The interior is a treasure trove of museum-quality Art Deco design.** Their 14 unique salons boasts a wealth of exotic woods, inlaid marquetry, original light fixtures, and handcrafted textiles. The choices here may seem endless, but that's where the event staff comes in, helping you every step of the way—from leading a full tour and recommending vendors, to selecting décor and customizing the catering team's seasonal menus.
