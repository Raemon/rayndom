## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The majestic Blue Ridge Mountains completely surround this Nacoochee Valley resort,** whose world-class amenities (including a golf course, spa, and multiple fine dining options) make it an enticing and gorgeous option for a destination weekend. 
  * **Verdant grounds, lush gardens, and pretty patios offer ample options** for outdoor vows and cocktails. There are indoor receptions spaces for gatherings of all sizes; we’re partial to the rustic-modern feel of the Nordic-inspired Great Hall, and the intimate, cozy vibes of the Staghorn Grill.
  * **There are packages available to suit every need and budget…** they even offer a full selection of packages expressly designed for elopements and micro-weddings. A collection of suites, bungalows, and townhomes ensure there’s a spot for every overnight guest.
