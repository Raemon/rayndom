## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This century-old department store turned boutique hotel exudes urban sophistication,** boasting brass accents and a glowing marquee that lights up Madison Avenue. Inside, plush velvet sofas, curated art, and glowing globe lights set the tone for a celebration that’s stylish but never stuffy.
  * **Their collection of event spaces run the gamut from elevated elegance to garden party charming.** The Eva G. Farris Ballroom embodies historic sophistication with its lovely neutral color scheme; the Lawn is perfect for al fresco gatherings, surrounded by exposed brick and plenty of greenery; and the expansive Lightwell is a true jawdropper, highlighted by an illuminating LED light display above the dance floor.
  * **Your guests will want to linger longer, thanks to the hotel’s plush amenities** and ideal Covington location. A talented events team is on hand to help you curate your perfect celebration, whether you envision an intimate elopement or a grand, weekend-long bash.
