  * **Grand views of 14,000-foot mountain ranges** surround this secluded, privately run Arkansas River valley property, with still more beauty to be found amid its meadows, wildflower fields, ponds, and waterfalls—all of which make lovely backdrops for your ceremony. 
  * **The rustic-modern design** **of the event center** creates a striking setting for receptions, with classic wood siding, stamped concrete flooring, barn-style sliding doors, a vaulted ceiling, and vintage-industrial light fixtures. 
  * **To round out the party with a solid dose of fun,** add use of the Lodge and Tavern on the Ranch, which offer indoor and outdoor bars, a stage, beer garden, bocce court, pool table, and gas fire pits.
