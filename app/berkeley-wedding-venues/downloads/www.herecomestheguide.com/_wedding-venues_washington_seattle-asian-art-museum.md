## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s a gorgeous Art Deco building.** Tucked into a beloved neighborhood park, the impressive Asian Art Museum houses a renowned collection of artworks along with wonderful architectural details. Access to the galleries, and even docent-led tours, can be added to your wedding package.
  * **Both the indoor and outdoor ceremony options are incredible.** Your ceremony may be held on the steps of the Front Terrace, with the towering entrance as your backdrop. The skylit Garden Court, with its soaring ceiling and stunning geometric lattice-framed windows, is where indoor celebrations are held. If you’d like even more space, use of the park grounds may be arranged through the city’s Parks and Recreation Department.
  * **The food is creative and beautiful.** Menus, which are fully customizable, are developed by Shooby Doo Catering at SAM, the exclusive caterer here as well as at the Seattle Art Museum and Olympic Sculpture Park. These culinary professionals successfully blend artful presentation with a focus on locally grown ingredients.
