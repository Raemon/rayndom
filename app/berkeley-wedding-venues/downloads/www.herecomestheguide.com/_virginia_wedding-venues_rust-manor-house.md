## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Taking the private road up to this 1908 manor feels like a beautiful sojourn into the country.** The 68-acre property, encompassing gardens, woods, meadows and trails, offers a serene and natural setting for your wedding just minutes outside the Beltway.
  * **The gracious white manor house itself makes a stunning backdrop for your ceremony.** With guests seated on the front lawn, you can exchange vows on the columned portico…or reverse the view, walk a flagstone path and get married against a thicket of mature trees.
  * **The fabulous 19th-century detailing is yours, all yours, to enjoy for the day.** You have exclusive use of the entire venue, which includes the dining room, parlor, library and two-story winding staircase—as well as the grounds and large, tented reception area.
