## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **More than twelve hundred acres of rolling hills and mature trees** surround this gorgeous central Florida club. Not only are the grounds completely breathtaking, the main elegant clubhouse is one of the most beautiful in the state. 
  * **A romantic terrace and lushly planted garden** make choosing your favorite ceremony spot the hardest decision you’ll face…but go ahead and check “elegant, glamorous reception space” off your list: The Grand Ballroom is completely stunning. 
  * **There are opulent private villas onsite to host overnight guests,** and your package includes use of two grand dressing suites for wedding party preparations. Fun package add-ons include spa services, golf rounds, and private pre-function luncheons.
