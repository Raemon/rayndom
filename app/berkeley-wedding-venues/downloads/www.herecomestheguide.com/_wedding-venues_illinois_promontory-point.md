## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Right on the shore of Lake Michigan,** this historic spot was the location of the 1933-34 World’s Fair, and boasts stunning views of both the lake and the glittering Chicago skyline.
  * **With its charming turret and sweeping surround of lush meadows,** the building welcomes guests with a timeless, vintage feel. Inside, you’ll find a warm, light-filled interior of stone and wood, including gorgeous exposed ceiling trusses. 
  * **The back terrace offers a beautiful panorama of the water and city,** and makes a wonderful location for your ceremony or cocktails. Rental rates are very reasonable, and help support the Chicago Parks department, which stewards this and other significant local sites.
