## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This lovely colonial mansion****was built for George Mason,** whose philosophical contributions had a profound influence on what would become the Declaration of Independence. Now a museum and interpretive center, it serves to preserve Mason’s legacy and offers visitors a glimpse into life in the mid-1700s. 
  * **Host your ceremony on the front lawn,** where the home itself, with its charming front porch and row of top floor dormer windows, provides an impressive backdrop. After cocktails in the courtyard, the celebration can continue in the Ann Mason Room, or on the ample lawns, which offer plenty of space for a tent, if you wish. 
  * **Your rental fee provides essential support to the museum,** whose efforts include educational outreach, acquisition and preservation of its impressive collection of documents and artwork, and ongoing archeological exploration of the home and grounds.
