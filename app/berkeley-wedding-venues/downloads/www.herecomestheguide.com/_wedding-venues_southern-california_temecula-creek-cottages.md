## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This historic retreat in Temecula wine country is storybook-charming,** with pretty whitewashed cottages nestled amid lush sprawling oaks and vibrant wildflower meadows**.** Vintage wagons and wine barrels, twinkle-lit patios, and lovely wooded pathways give the place a magical feel while retaining its down-to-earth charm.
  * **Ceremonies unfold on an oak-shaded knoll surrounded by greenery,** with your vows accompanied by gentle birdsong and the soft hum of the creek that winds through the property. When it’s time to gather for dinner, join your guests at long farm tables beneath the glow of twinkle lights as the stars reveal themselves above.
  * **The whole property becomes your private hideaway for the weekend,** with guest cottages (many pet-friendly!) clustered around a grassy courtyard, sunlit porches perfect for a warm cup of coffee or an evening rosé, and horses and chickens roaming nearby, all tucked away from the hustle and bustle.
