## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched atop a bluff with 180-degree views of Laguna Beach and the sparkling Pacific,** it's hard to beat this fabulous venue's location when it comes to jaw-dropping vistas. Ceremonies are often held on a platform at the cliff's edge, perfectly oriented westward to provide a spectacular sunset backdrop to your "I do"s.
  * **Soft ocean breezes accompany cocktails and hors d'oeuvres on the plush lawn,** followed by dancing on the adjacent checkered dance floor. As night falls, street lamps and twinkle lights augment the glow of candlelit tables, as the waves below murmur a soothing accompaniment.
  * **If you're a fan of "one-stop shopping," this is the place for you.** From artfully crafted cuisine to curated décor and florals to match your color palette, the talented events team are on hand to craft your perfect day. Who says the words "effortless" and "seaside celebration" can't appear in the same sentence?
