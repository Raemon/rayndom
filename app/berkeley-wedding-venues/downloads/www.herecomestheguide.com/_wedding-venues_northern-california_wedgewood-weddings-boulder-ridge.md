## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

At the top of a picturesque road that starts at Almaden Lake and heads up into the Santa Theresa Hills, there's a wedding venue that's sure to entice you with its spectacular, unobstructed views in virtually all directions.

Perched high on a plateau overlooking Boulder Ridge Golf Course, Wedgewood Weddings | Boulder Ridge was named for the dramatic sandstone rock formations that dot the hillside fairways. These striking boulders, which were part of land that was once home to the Ohlone Indians, now contribute to this location's unique landscape.

The banquet center's rough-hewn stone and earth-colored exterior blends organically with the natural tones of the Santa Cruz Mountains in the distance. Spreading out in front of the building is a lush lawn, adorned with several Craftsman-style arbors, each framing a different vista. The Welcome Arbor, with its nearby fountain, faces north, presenting arriving guests with a bird's-eye view of downtown San Jose's skyline. The Arbor, which you can enhance with your choice of flowers, garlands, crystals, or other decorations, becomes the focal point when everyone takes their seats and turns to watch the procession down the aisle. Vows are exchanged at the Gazebo, facing west towards the Almaden Valley, allowing the setting sun to form the perfect, glowing backdrop for the ceremony.

After saying "I do", invite everyone to enjoy cocktails and hors d'oeuvres on the adjoining Terrace, where a large granite-topped bar is a great place to get the party started. Since there's something interesting to catch your eye no matter where you look, it may be hard to tear your friends and family away from the scenery, but even after they sit down to dine inside the ballroom they're never far from the natural beauty and twinkling lights outside.

Wraparound windows framed in hand-stained sustainable wood cover two sides of the reception space, and a floor-to-ceiling fireplace with stone hearth dominates the fourth. Chandeliers with mottled glass shades and California _plein air_ paintings reinforce the indoor/outdoor motif of the open, airy ballroom

Wedgewood Weddings' expert event coordinator will help you choreograph your event from start to finish, but she's also happy to work with your own wedding planner. And as with all Wedgewood Weddings locations, the staff can customize your event package to your personal specs, budget and vision.

Before your shuttle or limo whisks you away to your new life, take a quiet stroll under the stars with your beloved—a truly romantic end to a memorable celebration.
