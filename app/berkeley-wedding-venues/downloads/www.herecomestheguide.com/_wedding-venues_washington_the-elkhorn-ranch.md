## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This family-run working ranch** **occupies a stunning spot along Washington’s coastal range.** Tucked at the foot of Colonel Bob Wilderness Area and just a stone’s throw from Olympic National Park and Lake Quinault, the mountain views are simply unparalleled. 
  * **With sloping, tree-covered hillsides in every direction,** your outdoor ceremony is guaranteed to be gorgeous. And the prettiness continues in the two-story reception barn, which features a lofty, open-rafter ceiling, wide plank wood flooring, and oversized doors that slide open to create perfect indoor/outdoor flow.
  * **There’s a spacious four-bedroom vacation rental right down the road.** Set on over five acres and boasting a custom kitchen, large entertaining deck, and multiple gathering spaces, it’s a wonderful place to spend some extra time with your dearest ones.
