## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With historic charm and all the modern amenities you could want,** this pretty brick loft is the ultimate blank canvas on which to create your vision. Plus, it's got a great central Elgin location that makes things easy for locals and travelers alike. 
  * **Oversized floor-to-ceiling windows stream ample light** onto the golden hardwood floors and weathered brick walls,**** and a beautiful ceiling of decorative pressed-tin tiles adds vintage charm.
  * **The space can be divided into smaller sections for an intimate affair,** or to create individualized areas during a larger event—lounges, photo spots, a kids' hideout—whatever your imagination can divine!
