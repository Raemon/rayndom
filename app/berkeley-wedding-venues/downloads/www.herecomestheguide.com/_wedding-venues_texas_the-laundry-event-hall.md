## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Cool vintage-industrial design and a fun history** (it really was once a laundry plant!), this private event space is tucked at the heart of quaint downtown Brenham, and is equally convenient to San Antonio, Austin, and Houston.
  * **Downstairs, you’ll find a large main hall with a dedicated bar** and wraparound mezzanine that offers a bird's eye view of the entire floor. An attached patio allows the party to flow outside on warm nights. The upstairs ballroom boasts a more intimate feel, with rough stone walls and towering windows that fill the space with light.
  * **The apartment-style loft** is**** outfitted with comfy furnishings, a king-sized bed, and a cute screened-in porch overlooking the patio below. It’s an ideal addition for both a day-of dressing suite and romantic honeymoon night.
