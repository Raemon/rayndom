## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The three-acre estate is bordered by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.** Richly wooded and brimming with flowering plants and water features, the scenery changes with the seasons and is beautiful year-round.
  * **Outdoor ceremonies are held beneath a chandelier-draped white arbor** or before a dramatic waterfall surrounded by natural beauty. Guests walk through a white gazebo into the little glen, and a romantic, mossy-stoned path provides the aisle. (The chapel may be used in case of rain or snow.)
  * **The intimate chapel echoes the style of traditional churches found throughout the South.** Its vintage facade gives way to a simple, modern interior, with a 6-foot brass chandelier and a formal lobby just outside the sanctuary.
