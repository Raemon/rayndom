## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This handsome historic restaurant in Pasadena’s lively “Old Town” is housed in a charming Craftsman cottage** and boasts a century-plus legacy of fine dining and exceptional hospitality.
  * **Intimate gatherings are celebrated on a choice of landscaped terraces:** The West Patio, enclosed by feathery greenery, has a trickling fountain and enough space for those wedding reception must-haves, like a dance floor and photo booth. The Fireplace Patio invites romantic ceremonies in front of a rustic stone hearth followed by a relaxing cocktail hour, while The Garden Patio offers a cozy, covered enclave for private get-togethers.
  * **The restaurant’s savvy coordination team will work closely with you to plan your wedding,** elopement, rehearsal dinner, engagement party, or other landmark occasion. They’ll advise how to incorporate The Raymond’s innovative New American cuisine, award-winning wine list, and signature handcrafted cocktails to create an elevated event experience.
