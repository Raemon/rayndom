## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **True to the "green" in its name,** this lush micro-wedding property in northeastern Connecticut is home to countless mature trees, beautiful glens and meadows, and sweeping views of the area's verdant hills and valleys.
  * **You're welcome to host your event anywhere on the grounds.** We're smitten with the Tree of Life, a massive sugar maple surrounded by flowerbeds and veggie gardens. The Orchard, with its picturesque apple trees and scattering of wildflowers, is a lovely choice, too. 
  * **Your package includes the assistance of a skilled event planner,** and can be expanded to include great extras, like custom floral arrangements and pretty, rustic-chic ceremony decor.
