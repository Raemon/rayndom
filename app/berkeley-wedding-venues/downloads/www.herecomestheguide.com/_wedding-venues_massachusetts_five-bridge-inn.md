## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Natural beauty meets New England charm** at this lovely 18th-century Inn, nestled on a lushly wooded 400-acre preserve. With two unique event venues, four thoughtfully curated bed & breakfast rooms, and the flexibility to custom-select your own vendors, it offers the perfect blend of easy and elegant.
  * **Exchange vows in a charming woodland chapel,** then dine & dance in the expansive Retreat Barn, a masterpiece of hand-sawn lumber and reclaimed architectural elements, and its adjoining cocktail pavilion, which is anchored by a stunning stone fireplace. Best of all, the affordable fee includes a 17-hour exclusive rental period—nearly double the time you can expect elsewhere!
  * **The chic Innkeeper's Barn exudes modern farmhouse style,** with soaring 40-foot ceilings, a wraparound mezzanine, a grand staircase, black-trimmed windows, and oversized doors that lead outside to a grassy lawn, where ceremonies are held beneath a gold or birch arbor, a charming gazebo, or a covered pavilion.
