## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Liberty Mountain offers three unique venues:** The new Highland Lodge has a casual elegance, and features a vaulted wood-beamed ceiling and bird's-eye views of the golf course. Boulder Ridge Lodge offers a private, intimate setting with a beautiful cedar gazebo, surrounded by the beautiful mountain landscapes. The Alpine Lodge has sweeping views of the mountain and two options for a ceremony.
  * **Your guests can stay at the resort's hotel** in one of their chic rooms or luxury suites. All accommodations provide easy access to the resort's amenities and include a full gourmet hot breakfast—plus, children 12 and under are free! Special guest room group rates are a part of your event package. 
  * **Who says the party has to end when the reception is over?** The late-night bar, Eagle & The Owl, boosts 20 rotating craft beers on tap and a full bar, live music every weekend, a shuffleboard table, and even a large outdoor fire pit guaranteed to keep your party going all night long.
