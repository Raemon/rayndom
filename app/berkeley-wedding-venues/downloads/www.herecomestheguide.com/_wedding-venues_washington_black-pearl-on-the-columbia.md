## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Looking across the majestic Columbia River to snow-capped Mount Hood,** this industrial-chic private event venue boasts striking architecture and customizable spaces designed for epic celebrations. 
  * **Two separate stories both offer incredible waterfront views,** thanks to towering, wraparound glass walls. Sleek features like steel beams, gleaming exposed ceiling ductwork, and vintage-style lighting add to the urban loft character. 
  * **Accordion doors open to a sprawling outdoor area** overlooking the marina below. It’s large enough to accommodate a ceremony, cocktail hour, or an entirely open-air soirée, and is accessible for food trucks and other mobile vendors.
