## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Just 30 minutes from Manhattan,** this jewel sits at the edge of Huntington Harbor, offering unforgettable views of the waterfront and the Gold Coast's glittering mansions across the bay. 
  * **The event spaces have a feel that's both contemporary and timeless** with a sleek, neutral color palette, rich hardwood flooring, floor-to-ceiling windows, and custom "intelligent" lighting to help you set just the right mood. 
  * **You're gonna love the Sunset Loft.** Start out the evening with cocktails in this stylish, rooftop lounge. Then, as the celebration is winding down, come back for the afterparty—there's even an attached, open-air deck that lets you take in the stellar harbor panorama.
