## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **There's a stunning array of indoor and outdoor options** at this New Jersey event center just minutes from New York City. You can exchange vows in the gazebo adorned with Grecian figures or in the impressive marble-filled Forum, which has a gorgeous mirrored ceiling.
  * **Natural light floods into the airy Greenhouse Room** through a wall of windows. Other spaces include the sophisticated Main Bar, where guests can enjoy piano accompaniment during a cocktail hour, and the more intimate Embassy room, illuminated by chandeliers.
  * **You can craft a customized menu of award-winning cuisine.** Select from a delicious variety of action stations, raw bars, butler-passed hors d'oeuvres, and dessert displays. You can even arrange for a custom ice sculpture.
