## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Built in the 1850s by the pioneer vintner Pierre Hypolite Dallidet,** this historic landmark is bursting with vintage charm: in addition to the quaint adobe farmhouse, many of the diverse trees, shrubs, and flowers are also original to the one-acre property.
  * **Process down a lovely bricked path to your garden ceremony,** where you'll exchange vows beneath a rustic wooden pergola. After the vows, you'll want to explore the sweet nooks and niches around the winding trails with your photographer, capturing romantic photos amid the garden's ever-changing landscape.
  * **Receptions unfold beneath a canopy of soaring redwoods and avocado trees** on one of the pretty brick courtyards, where the sweet songs of native birds serenade you as you dine among the colorful blooms. We also recommend inviting guests to enjoy docent-led tours of the adobe farmhouse, which provides even more wonder to this miraculous place.
