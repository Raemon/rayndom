## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The Pavilion offers up spectacular, hill country panoramas.** Enjoy the cool evening breeze (or A/C if you prefer) from this beautiful, indoor/outdoor venue with its soaring open-beam ceiling, expanses of glass, and Texas-sized limestone fireplace.
  * **There are reception venues to suit every style here.** If you want all-out glamour, reserve the Darrell K Royal Ballroom or the Wildflower Atrium, which both offer stunning views of the Fazio Foothills Golf Course. For a touch of rustic luxury, you’ll love the creekside Rock House.
  * **It’s a getaway destination that’s close to town.** Just minutes from downtown Austin, this full-service resort will make you want to turn your wedding into a vacay, whether you hit the links, go for a hike, or indulge in some pampering at the spa.
