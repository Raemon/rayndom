It's nerve-racking being responsible for an expensive piece of jewelry, right? Throw it in your bag, and you risk damaging the hardware. Keep it on during an intense workout, and you risk injuring your finger. Ring Bandits to the rescue! These wrist accessories are both stylish AND functional—keeping your valuables safe within a hidden zipper pocket.

## [Rent The Runway](https://www.renttherunway.com/)

[ ](https://www.renttherunway.com/)

Getting gussied up for all those pre-wedding events can really add up. And let's be real: how many times are you _actually_ going to wear that fancy outfit again? Instead of wasting your wedding budget on attire you likely won't wear more than once, check out Rent The Runway. From petite to plus size and handbags to jewelry, they carry show-stopping designer looks that you can affordably rent and return.

## [Hot Mess Ice Roller](https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/hot-mess-ice-roller)

[ ](https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/hot-mess-ice-roller)

Prepping for your big day can take up a lot of energy...not to mention the bach party that typically involves one too many mimosas...and the rehearsal dinner where next-day recovery is _key_. That's where The Skinny Confidential’s Hot Mess Ice Roller comes in. It uses a medley of cold therapy and facial manipulation to snatch your jaw line, reduce the appearance of fine lines, and prep the skin for makeup application. Try it with the Ice Queen Facial Oil for a double-whammy of antioxidants and hydration!

## [Slip Pure Silk Pillowcase](https://www.slip.com/)

[ ](https://www.slip.com/)

Don't get it twisted—these aren't bedding accessories...they're beauty products! Slip uses the highest-grade silk fibers and non-toxic dyes for their revolutionary friction-reducing pillowcases: meaning you won't wake up with face creases and bed head on your wedding morning. We're equally obsessed with their silk sleep masks and scrunchies. #excuseuswhileweaddtocart
