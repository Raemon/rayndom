## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The sky's the limit at Skylinks at Long Beach,** thanks to the attentive event staff, accommodating package options, and easily customizable event spaces. They've hosted all kinds of celebrations, from a casual cocktail reception to the most formal plated dinner and everything in between!
  * **Say "I do" beneath a white, trellised arch set against a striking backdrop:** a free-form rock waterfall and cascading pools, surrounded by a lush landscape of palm trees, flowering bushes and other greenery. As vows are exchanged, guests look on from their lawn seating, arranged in rows on either side of a petal-strewn aisle.
  * **Receptions are held in the expansive Sky Room,** whose vaulted ceiling makes it feel even more spacious. A wall of windows overlooks the property's signature waterfall, which is dramatically lit up at night. Just outside the Sky Room, a comfortable patio is yours to enjoy as well, with the nearby greens and the glorious waterfall balancing nature and artistry.
