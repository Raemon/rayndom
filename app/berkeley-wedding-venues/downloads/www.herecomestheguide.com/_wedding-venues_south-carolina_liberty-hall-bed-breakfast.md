##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Since its origins in 1849,** this charming home has had a vibrant and varied history: It’s been a family homestead, a dairy farm, an inn, university housing, and restaurant. Now, it’s been given new life as a welcoming B&B and quaint, intimate space to celebrate. 
  * **The garden features a sweet white gazebo to shelter your ceremony,** which can be followed by cocktails on the inn’s traditional southern porch. An elegant tent surrounded by mature oak and pecan trees hosts beautiful outdoor receptions. 
  * **You have the option to rent the entire home for the duration of your event,** allowing you to easily turn your celebration into a destination weekend. Guests will love the gracious accommodations, as well as the quick access to historic downtown Pendleton.
