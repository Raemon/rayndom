## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled in the heart of quaint, sun-kissed Sunol sits this utterly enchanting private venue,** where Old World glamour meets rustic charm. The passionate events team boasts over 40 years of service experience, meaning you'll be in good hands throughout the process, from dreaming up the best photo ops to planning the perfect menu.
  * **Sea-blue gates open onto the bountiful garden, where you'll exchange vows beneath a grand pergola** supported by stone pillars and topped with rough-hewn wooden beams. Bright green foliage winds from the pillars toward the pergola’s roof, ending in a cascade of delicate white flowers. In the background, there’s a softly trickling fountain, and beyond that, a stunning vista of the distant hills.
  * **Hors d'oeuvres might be enjoyed on the airy patio overlooking the town's historic train station...** or cross the street to the station for something extra special—a moving cocktail hour on a vintage train car! Your delectable dinner is served**** in the reception hall, which boasts exposed brick walls, vintage mirrors, dramatic drop-down light pendants, and glittering chandeliers.
