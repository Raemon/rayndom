## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With an elevated country club feel and sweeping vistas of the surrounding landscape,** this stylish venue provides the perfect blend of elegance and natural beauty. Tiered all-inclusive packages make the planning process smooth and simple, and the personalized attention of the events team ensure every detail is well managed from start to finish.
  * **Say "I do" directly on the soft greens against a picturesque backdrop of sun-kissed mountains,** the verdant fairway, and—if you're lucky—the peaceful resident deer. Cocktails may be enjoyed on the spacious patios, where you can sip on signature beverages and enjoy tasty nibbles while basking in the colorful light of the sun setting over the tree-covered hills.
  * **The Craftsman-inspired Hilltop Room boasts three walls of floor-to-ceiling windows** that open onto a spacious patio for a truly spectacular indoor/outdoor flow. Feast on delicious cuisine carefully prepared by the in-house chefs, take a spin on the dance floor beneath glowing chandeliers, and mingle with your loved ones on the veranda, taking in the sparkling Los Angeles skyline and twinkling stars as night descends.
