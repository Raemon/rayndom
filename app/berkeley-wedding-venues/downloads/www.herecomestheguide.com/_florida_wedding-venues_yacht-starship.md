## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Three luxury yachts make up this fantastic fleet** —each climate-controlled vessel boasts multiple indoor and outdoor decks that can be used for ceremonies, cocktails, and receptions. Weddings of all sizes are more than welcome, from just the lovebirds, to intimate micro weddings, to luxurious celebrations of over 300 guests.
  * **Once you've said "I do", it's time to cruise!** Treat your guests to an unforgettable sunset over the water, and unparalleled views of sights like Harbor Island, Davis Island, and the city skylines.
  * **Boats can depart from a number of docks in the area** , including Tampa, Clearwater, St. Petersburg, St. Pete Beach, Sarasota, or Tarpon Springs, so you'll have ultimate flexibility when planning accommodations and other wedding weekend events. Whatever your vision, their talented team is up to the task—and excited to explore every couple's unique budget, vision, and style.
