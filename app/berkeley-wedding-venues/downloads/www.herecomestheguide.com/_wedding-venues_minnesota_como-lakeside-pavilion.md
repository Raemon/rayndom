## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set beside the serene waters of Como Lake, you’ll find this iconic pavilion,** where the gracious early 20th-century architecture provides the perfect blend of classic romance and relaxed nostalgia. The elegant Waterfall Room on the third floor is a favorite event space, with richly painted coffered ceilings draped with glowing golden chandeliers, and large lake-view windows adorned with beautiful criss-crossed copper panes.
  * **The open-air Promenade’s grand colonnades exude historic elegance,** with pairs of columns supporting a soaring roof**** and framing sweeping views of the water on three sides. It’s the perfect place for an al fresco ceremony, a sunkissed cocktail hour, or dancing the night away—a large built-in stage with topnotch lighting and sound are fully equipped for your band or DJ.
  * **The experts at** _**Lancer Hospitality**_**will help you craft every detail,** from designing the flow of the event to customizing the perfect menu. With a reputation for warm service, social and environmental responsibility, and imaginative, custom-curated cuisine, they’re guaranteed to create an experience your guests won’t soon forget.
