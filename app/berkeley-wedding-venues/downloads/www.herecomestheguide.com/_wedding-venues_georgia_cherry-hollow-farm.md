## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **An artful blend of architecture, heritage, and imagination** , this unbelievably cool venue was assembled entirely from the remnants of historically significant sites across the country. And because it sits in the footprint of a farmstead in the Chattahoochee Hills, it offers plenty of beautiful natural scenery, too.
  * **The stunning, rustic-chic indoor spaces include a dining hall** , reception room, cocktail lounge, and intimate chapel. Throughout each one, you'll find fascinating touches like massive arches built from the brick of the original Eli Whitney cotton warehouse, and artifacts from turn-of-the-century textile mills, power plants, and farmsteads. 
  * **Outside, you'll find plenty of options for al fresco celebrations** , including a private courtyard, open lawns, and a peaceful lake. Did we mention it's also a working farm, with lots of friendly (and photogenic) animals?
