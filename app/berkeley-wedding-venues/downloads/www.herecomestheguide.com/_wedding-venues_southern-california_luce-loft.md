## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Bring your vision to life at this impressive, industrial-elegant venue,** nestled in San Diego's vibrant East Village. Their generous open vendor policy provides tons of flexibility, and the passionate event staff will work closely with you to help craft a celebration that's totally _YOU._
  * **A soaring arched barrel ceiling presides over the dramatic central space,** which is framed by rough poured concrete walls and floors. A mezzanine spans the length of one wall, illuminated by a peaked skylight. Use this upper level to make a picture-perfect entrance into your ceremony, or as a cozy lounge retreat during the reception.
  * **A sliding barn door with a chic wood chevron pattern** is the perfect backdrop for your vows, whether left as-is or accented with a traditional arch or chuppah, draped with florals, or styled with potted succulents and macrame wall hangings. Of course, you're also encouraged to find your own "just right" setting—perhaps against the far wall, using the barn door for a dramatic entrance, or perched atop the mezzanine.
