  * **The stunning glass Conservatory is perfect for an intimate ceremony.** Built in the early 1900s, this historic gem—listed on the National Register of Historic Places—is filled with lush greenery and fragrant flowers that create a gorgeous setting for exchanging vows.
  * **You can host your cocktail hour in the grand lobby** , which overlooks the Conservatory, followed by a reception in the Rubinstein Room, a cozy space that opens onto a beautiful bluestone patio and gardens.
  * **The variety of photo ops is amazing** , thanks to Mediterranean, tropical, and desert gardens, plus the enchanting addition of a koi fish pond and tropical birds.
