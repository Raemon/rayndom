## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched on the banks of Lake Natoma and walking distance to charming shops and restaurants,** this welcoming hotel is a beloved fixture in the heart of historic Folsom. Everything you need to plan your perfect event is at hand here—expert in-house coordinators, a talented culinary team, and beautifully appointed guest rooms—all in a lovely lakeside location.
  * **The garden patio, landscaped with seasonal blooms,****tiered fountains, and mature trees,** is a lovely setting for your ceremony. Say "I do" here, or in the quaint gazebo, then grab your photographer for some magnificent golden hour photos beneath the dramatic bridge suspended over sparkling Lake Natoma, just behind the hotel.
  * **In the Grand Pavilion, rich white draping cascades from the ceiling,** creating a magical, hidden-away feel; two additional ballrooms offer even more options. End your big night in one of their Premium Lakeside Suites, outfitted with a cozy wood-burning fireplace, lovely views, and a romantic Whirlpool Tub.
