## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled amid over 100 acres of lush woodland and meadows** in the Hilltowns area of Massachusetts, this arts-based retreat center has a magical, hidden forest vibe and collection of versatile spaces perfectly suited for memorable celebrations. 
  * **With its orchard, towering trees, gardens, and pond,** you’ll have no trouble finding a pretty spot to set your outdoor ceremony. The lawn is more than spacious enough for a tented gathering, or you can take the party inside—we love the intimate Rectangle Barn, connected to the main Farmhouse, and the unique, circular Umbrella Studio. 
  * **House 70 people overnight in the gracious, three-story Gratitude Lodge,** and even more guests are welcome to camp on the grounds. Spend the days exploring the land and local area, splashing in the swimming quarry, or relaxing in the wood-fired sauna.



### DEALS: _What discounts, special offers, or packages are available here?_
