## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With a traditional, timeless Cape Cod look** and all the modern amenities you need, this pretty inn offers beautiful event spaces and easy access to all the Cape's favorite attractions. 
  * **Say your "I do"s on a wide lawn at the edge of Jones Pond,** or in a charming gazebo bounded by trees. Then, move indoors to one of the light, airy banquet rooms, all of which feature oversized windows overlooking the grounds. 
  * **They offer a broad range of generously-sized guest accommodations,** from romantic king and queen rooms to two-bedroom suites large enough for families.
