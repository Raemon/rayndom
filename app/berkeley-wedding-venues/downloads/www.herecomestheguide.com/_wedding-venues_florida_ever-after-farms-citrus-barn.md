## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Surrounded by 20 acres of lush citrus groves, this sweet property is truly a hidden gem** just 20 minutes from Disney and an hour from Tampa and Orlando. Transparent pricing and generous packages make planning easy, and their open vendor policy ensures your vision becomes a reality.
  * **Make your entrance through a set of barn doors to the citrus grove ceremony site** , where you'll exchange vows amid the lovely trees surrounded by your friends and family. After the "I do"s, capture timeless photos throughout the property: with an antique 1953 Chevy truck, on a romantic swing, and spinning away on a lovely outdoor dance floor. 
  * **It’s operated by the pros at Ever After Farms** , whose collection of working farms and top-notch barn venues have become some of Florida’s most beloved event destinations. From your initial inquiry to the day of your event, their dedicated team is there to answer questions, address concerns, and ensure that every detail is cared for. In other words, you'll become part of their family… and you’ll be so glad you did.
