## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This American Revolution-era estate exudes classic Old World elegance,** with a stunning historic fieldstone manor house, a light-filled ballroom, and a grand flagstone Patio, all surrounded by 173 acres of pastoral landscape: rolling hills studded with pretty ponds, manicured gardens, and fairy-tale forests. 
  * **Say “I do” between two rows of soaring, ancient oaks,** or beneath a picturesque portico with views of the surrounding grounds. Cocktail hour might flow from the lawn into the dramatic Casanova Bar, crafted entirely of stone and wood, with a cozy fireplace and heavy oak beams overhead. Receptions follow in the adjacent Glass Ballroom, where arched windows and high ceilings keep the outdoors close.
  * **The nearby Poplar Spring Inn & Spa is the perfect home base for your wedding weekend,** with ample accommodations, plush amenities like an outdoor pool, hot tub & sauna, and putting green, and a spa for all that pre- and post-nuptial relaxation. Work with the experts at The Manors VA to craft your day, with flexible, all-inclusive packages that make the process smooth and stress-free.
