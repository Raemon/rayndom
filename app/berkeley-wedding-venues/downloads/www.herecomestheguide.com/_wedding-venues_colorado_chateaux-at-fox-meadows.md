## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **They have flexible packages for a full range of budgets.** Making sure a delightful wedding is within reach of every couple is a priority here. From an all-inclusive “platinum” plan to simple “elegance on a budget,” there’s a package that will work for you.
  * **You’ll have total privacy.** Since its first event, the owners of the Chateaux have been “anti-wedding factory.” That means that whatever date you choose will be yours alone—no need to rush out to make way for the next couple. You can simply relax and enjoy.
  * **Weddings are what they do best.** The Chateaux was designed and built with the express purpose of hosting weddings, and it’s perfectly suited to the task. Plus the staff there has been producing wonderful events for nearly 20 years, so you know they’re well prepared to help make your day fantastic.
