## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's got fabulous architecture:** Originally a turn-of-the-century metal foundry, this thoroughly restored and renovated building features arched brick walls and a soaring, metal-beamed ceiling with a huge skylight. There's also a mezzanine in the main space that provides additional room for seating or mingling.
  * **The event spaces are quite versatile:** Exchange vows in a brick-walled "greenhouse", as light pours in through the spectacular glass ceiling. Then serve cocktails on the elevated Terrace, where guests enjoy great views of the Manhattan skyline and Queensboro Bridge. Host your reception in the plant-filled Courtyard, which can be used al fresco or tented. 
  * **You'll have the freedom to create:** The Foundry provides a captivating backdrop for whatever style event you have in mind. And to realize your vision, you may choose your own caterer, rental company, etc., or use the venue's recommended vendors. Plus, their industrial kitchen has plenty of equipment and prep space—and it's included in the price of the rental.
