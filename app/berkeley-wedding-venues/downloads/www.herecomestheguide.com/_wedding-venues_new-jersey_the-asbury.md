  * **This jewel of the Jersey Shore—** a historic hotel that’s been artfully shifted into the present—has all the modern luxuries required for dreamy stays and stellar events…and its unique, whimsical styling, with Scandavian flare and nods to the Asbury Park’s rock n’ roll roots, makes for incredible photo backdrops. 
  * **The gathering places are as fun and varied as the hotel itself,** like the colorful, indoor/outdoor Asbury Hall & Terrace, and Baronet, a rooftop spot offering a panoramic sight of the Atlantic and the bustling town below. Blanketed with an artificial lawn, it also boasts a movie theater-sized projection screen. 
  * **You’ll fall in love with their fabulous guest suites.** Perfect for a romantic honeymoon night or a day of prepping with your faves, they boast spacious communal areas with fun, eclectic design and lots of natural light for your makeup and pics.
