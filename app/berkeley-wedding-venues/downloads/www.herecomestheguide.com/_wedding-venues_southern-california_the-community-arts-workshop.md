## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Cool arts complex just off of State Street that's a DIY dream,** and an industrial-chic blank canvas for your own party vision.
  * **Celebrations flow from the bistro-lit Courtyard into the spacious Assembly Room** \--an open barn-like space with whitewashed brick walls, peaked ceiling with skylights and rough-hewn rafters just begging for your personalized decor.
  * **Your rental fee goes to support this worthy non-profit** whose motto is "Workspace for the Inspired": And it's also an inspired spot to host a special occasion. Plus, it's close to the beach and the Santa Barbara Funk Zone with its wineries, galleries, boutiques and restaurants!
