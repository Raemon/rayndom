## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set in a gorgeous converted dairy barn that dates back to the early 20th century** , this spacious venue an hour north of Seattle includes designated dressing rooms to fit both wedding parties.
  * **A stone path winding through vine-covered arbors leads to a Victorian gazebo** in the Front Courtyard, making a lovely outdoor ceremony location. The willow, white birch, and cherry trees surrounded by ferns and hydrangeas offer a beautiful backdrop year-round.
  * **With a hardwood floor and white rosette panels backlit with twinkle lights** , the Carriage Room provides an elegant reception space. You can also opt for the Grand Room, which features six sets of French doors, a high ceiling, and romantic balconies.
