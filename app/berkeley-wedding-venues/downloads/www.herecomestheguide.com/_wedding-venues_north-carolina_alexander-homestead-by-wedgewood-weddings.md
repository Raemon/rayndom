## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Just minutes from the heart of Charlotte** ,**this captivating 1903 Queen Anne Victorian estate** **is secluded amidst 8 acres of lush botanical gardens** complete with a waterfall pond and 200-year-old oak trees. The storybook setting, with its leafy greenery, seasonal blooms and heritage roses, offers a gorgeous backdrop for outdoor ceremonies beneath a white garden pavilion. Then while the newlyweds capture romantic photos around the scenic property, friends and family mingle on the spacious Heritage Lawn and Victorian veranda enjoying cocktails and hors d’oeuvres as they soak in the picturesque surroundings.
  * **The farmhouse-inspired Grand Hall brings timeless elegance to receptions:** A soaring, exposed-beam ceiling is absolutely lovely with sheer white draping and twinkle lights. Herringbone-patterned wood walls team with polished floors and customized tablescapes to create a welcoming rustic-modern aesthetic. 
  * **Two unique get-ready suites outfitted with the latest conveniences and tons of historic charm** invite couples and their wedding parties to relax and prepare in style**.** Wedgewood Wedding’s legendary all-inclusive packages offer a range of celebration enhancements, and Alexander Homestead’s experienced team is dedicated to delivering seamless wedding experiences that make the most of this epic location.
