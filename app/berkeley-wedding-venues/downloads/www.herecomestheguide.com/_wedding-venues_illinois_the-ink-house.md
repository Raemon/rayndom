## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Once the home of Edwardsville’s local newspaper,** this unique space—tucked right at the heart of the city’s charming downtown district—has been stylishly restored, and now boasts innovative gathering areas that lovingly preserve the building’s historic integrity.
  * **The Press Room's design is rustic-industrial sophistication at its best,** with exposed brick walls, a vaulted ceiling, tons of natural light, and flooring of wood and polished concrete. There’s also a beautiful Art Deco-inspired bar area, and a fun in-house photo booth.
  * **An adjacent venue, Off The Record,** features a chic outdoor “urban courtyard” and an additional indoor space; it can be rented on its own, or in conjunction with the Press Room. There’s a posh boutique hotel right next door, so you won’t have to go far once the evening wraps up.
