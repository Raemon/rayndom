## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Exemplifying the warm, neighborly feel of its Upper West Side setting, this elegant hotel** is the perfect setting for small celebrations in the Big Apple. For couples who seek to embrace the sophistication of an intimate wedding, carefully crafted and meticulously managed by an expert events team, the Wallace has everything you need.
  * **The neutral color palette of the Sterling Room invites creativity,** and built-in AV technology, a top-tier sound system, and ambient lighting give you the tools to bring your vision to life. Consider a welcome dinner or cocktail hour in the plush Wallace Lounge, which boasts plush banquette seating, a striking mirrored bar, and a fabulous menu of sips and bites that can be curated to your tastes.
  * **Located steps from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History,** the location (and photo ops!) are unbeatable. When it's finally time to put the day to rest, you'll enjoy the generously sized guest rooms, each outfitted with luxury amenities, oversized windows, and thoughtfully curated décor.
