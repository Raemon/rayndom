## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked within a lush private community on Savannah’s Skidaway Island,** the grounds of this club are simply beautiful for photos, with footbridges, water features, and hundreds of moss-draped trees. 
  * **You can wed outside beneath the branches of the oaks,** or beside a pond with a cascading fountain. After cocktail on the string-lit lawn, celebrate in the ballroom, which oozes classic elegance with subtle modern touches, like lantern-inspired chandeliers.
  * **There are plenty of vacation rentals available in nearby island and mainland communities,** making it easy for those planning a destination weekend, and all the charms of historic downtown Savannah are less than 30 minutes away.
