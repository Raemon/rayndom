## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its timeless feel and lushly manicured perennial garden surroundings,** this stately home—built in 1879 by renowned architect Frank Furness—boasts a romantic, Tudor-inspired design and an ideal location, just a few minutes northeast of downtown Philly. 
  * **Start the day with photos in the mansion’s dreamy interior,** with its luxe period furnishings and beautiful light. There’s a large white arbor in the garden for your vows, and a custom, vintage-chic Conservatory with adjacent cocktail terraces for your reception. 
  * **Because it’s managed by the experienced team at Conroy Catering,** you can relax on the big day knowing that everything, down to the smallest detail, will be taken care of. They can host your rehearsal dinner or shower, too, either at the Mansion, or their sister venue, Bridgemen’s Ballroom.
