## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Vineyard romance meets Arizona desert beauty** at this working winery, where rocky limestone soil and sunny climate mirror the wine regions of France and Italy, creating world-class wines right where the Verde River and Oak Creek converge. The panoramic mountain and vineyard views are so stunning that couples consistently mention needing minimal decorations.
  * **Your ceremony can unfold in the charming open-air Tuscan chapel** with its wood-beam ceiling and rustic chandeliers, or you can choose any picturesque spot throughout the vineyard. The surrounding lawn area transitions perfectly into cocktail hour with award-winning Arizona wines.
  * **We're obsessed with how this venue delivers luxury vineyard vibes at surprisingly affordable pricing.** You get BYO catering flexibility, exceptional service from the team, and your guests can go home with bottles of actual Arizona wine from where you got married!
