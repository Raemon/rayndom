## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Commanding an extraordinary panorama of the bay and Peninsula, this secluded winery** sits high on a quiet bluff just off Skyline Boulevard. At the top of the ridge is a large garden lawn, beautifully landscaped around the perimeter—a perfect spot for an outdoor ceremony.
  * **Open-air gatherings are truly stunning on the Pavilion, a covered redwood deck suspended over the hillside.** This architectural treat is constructed of teal-painted columns and beams which support a peaked cedar roof inset with skylights. You have a 270-degree view of the surrounding oak-dotted hills, the Chardonnay vineyards below, and the bay.
  * **A few steps down from the lawn, you'll find Hill House, a thoughtfully appointed venue** with a stone fireplace, fine woodwork, skylights, a wine bar, and a semi-glass-enclosed terrace from which you can see for miles. For small private dinners, the Redwood Room is light and airy, outfitted with custom-built "barrel" tables, handcrafted leather chairs, a wood-burning stove, and a panoramic view of the bay.
