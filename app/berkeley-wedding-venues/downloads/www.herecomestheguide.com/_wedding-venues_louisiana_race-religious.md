## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Steeped in nearly two centuries of history** and named for the two streets its corner lot occupies, this Lower Garden District event center in downtown New Orleans features three structures and both indoor and outdoor spaces, including a bougainvillea-lined courtyard and a swimming pool area lit by gas lamps.
  * **The property is a collection of unique, historic buildings,** including a three-story Greek Revival rowhouse and traditional Creole Cottages. All have been lovingly restored and appointed with a whimsical array of handpicked antiques. Included in the site rental are two commercial kitchens, five bathrooms, four bedrooms, and multiple balconies.
  * **Meaningful details abound throughout the property,** from the Peruvian tabernacle and blessed Virgin statue rescued from a bulldozed church to the original moldings and unvarnished staircases that preserve traces of previous residents.
