## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It began life as a steam plant in the 1890s,** but lives on as a vibrant performing arts and event space in the heart of Fishtown. Craft cocktails are truly an art here, and each distinct space boasts its own antique bar. 
  * **Speakeasy vibes and historic charm fill the rooms,** which retain much of their original exposed brick, cobblestone, and wood elements. Vintage chandeliers and eclectic art add just a bit of whimsy and glam. 
  * **The neighborhood is a hub of artistic, culinary, and musical hotspots,** so guests staying nearby will have no shortage of ways to fill their days and nights (but it’s super convenient to access for locals, too.)
