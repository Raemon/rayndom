## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With two stories of industrial-modern event space and a great South Philly location,** this light-filled venue boasts a wonderfully flexible layout, with design that draws inspiration from its vibrant, eclectic neighborhood.
  * **Your photos will pop,** thanks to cool details like rich wood floors and ceilings, exposed brick, steel beams and ductwork, and a historic brick bar. And the outdoor courtyard presents the option for an al fresco ceremony or cocktail hour. 
  * **Bring in any licensed caterer (or even food truck!) of your choosing,** and you’re welcome to either supply your own alcohol, or hire a bar service. Not sure which route to go? No worries—the Loft can supply you with a stellar list of trusted local vendors.
