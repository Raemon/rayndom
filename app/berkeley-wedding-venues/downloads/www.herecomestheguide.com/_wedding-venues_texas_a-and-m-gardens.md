## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The gardens are exquisite.** Over A and M's 50-year history, the owners have transformed ordinary bike trails into a blooming oasis of fountains, romantic bridges, peaceful stone walkways, ferns, flowering plants, and towering shade trees. Ceremonies may be held outdoors in any season. 
  * **Receptions unfold in a bright, cheerful reception hall.** This fantastic room is equipped with a sound system, dance floor, and pretty ceiling fans. Tasteful, neutral colors on the walls will complement whatever decorations you add.
  * **You can provide your own alcohol and choose your own vendors.** Their ultra-flexible policy can save you a great deal of money, and allow you to be as creative as you like with your food, bar, and décor. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, though, A&M will refer you to a list of trusted local vendors.
