## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With an alluring blend of sophistication and relaxed charm, this lovely riverfront venue** takes advantage of its prime location on the Eastern Shore, considered Maryland's best kept secret. Set amid lush conservation land, two premiere 18-hole golf courses, and along acres of pristine waterfront on the Chester River and Queenstown Creek, it's the perfect destination for an intimate celebration.
  * **Ceremonies are held on a velvety lawn that unfurls towards the sparkling river,** making a truly picturesque spot for you "I do"s. Inside, three indoor event spaces are appointed with plush, modern furnishings that exude casual elegance and make plenty of space for your vision. Food & beverage packages are completely customizable and tailored to you—no cookie-cutter weddings here.
  * **There's plush lodging for everyone on your guest list.** Large groups will love the luxurious cottages, with their expansive indoor and outdoor entertaining spaces, modern kitchens, and panoramic water views; the adorable bungalows are equally lovely, with private decks and communal courtyards perfect for an evening mingle. Plus, you'll all get priority tee times!
