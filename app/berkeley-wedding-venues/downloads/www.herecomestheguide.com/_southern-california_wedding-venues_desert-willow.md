## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This exquisite, award-winning club is an oasis amid desert beauty,** with its deep green fairways interspersed with the subtle hues of regional flora: silvery sage, golden-tipped brittlebush, and tiny lavender blooms of the namesake desert willow. The sleek, sophisticated clubhouse seamlessly blends with the surrounding environment, skillfully utilizing native plants alongside natural-toned flagstone and wood.
  * **Sweeping vistas of the mountain-rimmed greens, lakes, and desert palms** can be enjoyed from nearly every venue. Celebrations are lovely on the Palm Desert Terrace, perched above the golf course with views of the Chocolate Mountains, as well as the Event Lawn, a sweep of grass that faces the 18th fairway and the shimmery lake. For an indoor option, the dazzling Firecliff Ballroom boasts a wall of double-tall glass walls that frame postcard-perfect panoramas.
  * **The best-in class events team and generous packages make planning easy...** and won't break the bank. Their award-winning chef creates meals that rival those served in the finest restaurants, with tiered options that ensure you're able to find just the right fit. In-house wedding concierge and coordination services may be added on for a small additional fee—a huge perk, as they know just about everything about the venue to ensure the day is smooth and stress-free.
