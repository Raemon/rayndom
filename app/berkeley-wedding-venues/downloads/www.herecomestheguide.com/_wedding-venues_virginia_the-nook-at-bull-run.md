## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This tucked-away gem, nestled at the edge of Bull Run Regional Park,** sits in a peaceful clearing that feels worlds away from nearby D.C. Al fresco gatherings are set on a pretty lawn surrounded by naturally lush greenery and picturesque forest.
  * **With space for just the people who matter most,** The Nook is made for small weddings and elopements, with affordable packages perfectly scaled for intimate affairs. Lovely arch adornment, floral details, and reception décor are included, ensuring every celebration has a truly beautiful backdrop.
  * **As night falls, glowing bistro lights illuminate overhead** , creating a magical atmosphere amid the trees. A rustic wooden backdrop (or a balloon arch, macrame draping, or whatever else you imagine!) set the stage for memorable photos.
