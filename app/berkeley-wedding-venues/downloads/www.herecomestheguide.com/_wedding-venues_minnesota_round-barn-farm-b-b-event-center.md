## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Listed on the National Register of Historic Places,** the 1914 round barn at the heart of this family-owned venue is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the midwest. Surrounded by 35 private acres along the bluffs of the Mississippi River, it’s a timeless, postcard-perfect spot. 
  * **There are two pretty outdoor ceremony spaces,** each offering a different lush, romantic backdrop. The iconic round barn hosts your cocktail hour and dancing, and for your reception dining, there’s an open-sided wedding pavilion with a distinct, rustic-modern design and attached string-lit patio. 
  * **The three-story brick country manor home has been lovingly converted into a five-room B &B** that sleeps ten overnight guests. Originally built in 1861, each suite has been outfitted with welcoming, period-inspired furnishing along with all the modern comforts required for a cozy stay. Additional lodging can be found just minutes away in Red Wing.
