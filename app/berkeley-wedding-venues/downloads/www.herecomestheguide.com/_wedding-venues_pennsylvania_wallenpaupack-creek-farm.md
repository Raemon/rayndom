## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This truly special family-owned farm feels like a pastoral dream-come-true,** set on a lush 40-acre property encompassing verdant pastures, mature forest, and layered mountain views that shift beautifully with the light—all just two hours from both NYC and Philadelphia. 
  * **Dance the night away in the remarkable 1839 barn,** which**** boasts exquisite hand-hewn original beams, stonework, and a vintage church bell, along with plenty of modern conveniences to ensure a fabulous party. Al fresco ceremonies are shaped by the landscape, whether held creekside, beside the paddock, or before the barn’s striking façade. 
  * **Spend the weekend with your sweetie in the adorable Honeymoon Yurt,** with overnight lodgings for two included in all multi-day rentals. The affordable pricing structure also features plenty of great perks: a complimentary décor library, month-of coordination, and even a shuttle via tractor-pulled hay wagon or side-by-side ATV!
