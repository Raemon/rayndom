## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This sculptural, contemporary chapel is a piece of art** nestled in charming Hill Country. The faceted limestone exterior boasts pivot doors on either end, welcoming guests into the soaring, light-filled interior and creating a sense of unity with the surrounding landscape.
  * **It’s ideal for elopements, with handcrafted maple benches** seating up to 30 of your loved ones, and additional space for others (including furry family members) to stand in the pretty elliptical patio on one end.
  * **Your ceremony takes center stage here, literally.** The airy layout brings everyone in close—its trapezoidal shape is nestled into a gentle slope, ensuring all your seated and standing guests to enjoy a perfect view of your “I do”s, and with acoustics designed to carry every word.
