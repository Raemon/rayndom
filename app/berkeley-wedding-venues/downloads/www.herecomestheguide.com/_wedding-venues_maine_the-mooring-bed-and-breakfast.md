  * **Occupying a stunning bluff-top spot on Georgetown Island,** this fourth-generation, family-owned estate features charming historic buildings and gardens, and a desirable midcoast location that offers easy access to the area’s favorite destinations. (Your hosts are always ready with fun suggestions!)
  * **Say your vows beneath a white pergola overlooking the Atlantic,** followed by a tented reception on the pretty lawn. For a festive and very “Maine” experience, treat your guests to a traditional lobster bake featuring locally-sourced seafood and all the fixings.
  * **The B &B has five wonderful guest rooms** which boast airy, coastal design and beautiful views. Gracious communal spaces, like the porch and the inviting Spanish Room, are wonderful places to gather with your loved ones after a day of exploring.
