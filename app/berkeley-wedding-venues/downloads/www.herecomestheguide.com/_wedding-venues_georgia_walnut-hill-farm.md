## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The Hilltop Barn is truly impressive** , with a soaring, open-raftered ceiling, polished concrete floor, and large doors that open to the surrounding meadows. You can even peek down on all the preparations from your secluded upstairs dressing suite.
  * **There are wonderful intimate venues** , too, like the delightful Pond Pavilion, a covered porch-style space overlooking a pond, and the Cottage by the Pond, with its quaint interior, lush private gardens, and shady patio.
  * **Spend a romantic wedding night in the darling Carriage House** , tucked next to the orchard and gardens. Friends and family can retire to the comfort of the Cottage Bed & Breakfast, a four-bedroom retreat complete with a gourmet kitchen, media room, and cozy gas fireplaces.
