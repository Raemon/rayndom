## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s a 19th-Century brick treasure with a storied history****—** before the lavish renovation that turned it into a jazz club, the building had been a cotton depot, a grocery store, and a neighborhood bar. 
  * **The spectacular two-story glass atrium is a wonderful twist** on a traditional New Orleans courtyard, with towering ficus trees, romantic market lighting, and a beautiful wrought-iron balcony. 
  * **Following your vows, you’ll celebrate in true Big Easy style****—** guests can flow between the atrium and the cozy supper club-style interior, sipping signature cocktails and noshing on your in-house caterer’s take on local classics like jambalaya and beignets.
