## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's a fabulous park with an awesome Pacific Northwest location,** tucked between ancient redwood forests and the ever-changing panorama of Puget Sound. 
  * **Exchange vows in the lush Meadow or on the dramatically elevated Promontory,** both of which overlook the Sound, Marina pier, and the Olympic Mountain Range. 
  * **Receptions can be held in the mid-century Auditorium,** with its cathedral ceiling and colorful glass windows, the cheerful, "small-town America"-inpsired Dining Hall, or the sleek Founder's Lodge. Or, keep things al fresco with a celebration in the open-sided Picnic Shelter.
