## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A 1929 landmark designed in Moorish Gothic-style by famed architect Julia Morgan** , this sensational "Little Castle" features landscaped inner courtyards and fountains, plus a wealth of graceful arches, domed ceilings, pillars, leaded-glass windows and doors, and art, creating a gorgeous backdrop for your one-of-a-kind wedding.
  * **Ceremonies are lovely on the**gracious second-floor Terrace**** , where you can exchange vows framed by leaded-glass windows, beautiful draping, and a waterproof awning for year-round comfort. Grand receptions follow in the Venetian Ballroom just steps away, which boasts vaulted ceilings, a built-in stage, and original chandeliers.
  * **The Drawing Room's wrought-iron, stone, and tile detailing exude vintage glamour.** Host your ceremony before the oversized, impeccably carved fireplace, or opt to say "I do" in the lovely, sheltered East Courtyard—both are perfectly scaled for intimate celebrations.
