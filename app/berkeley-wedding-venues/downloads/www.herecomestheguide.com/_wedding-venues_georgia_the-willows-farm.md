## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled at the heart of 300 pristine acres****in the North Georgia foothills,** this secluded private event venue offers a unique blend of elegantly curated spaces and unspoiled natural beauty.
  * **The Victorian-style Greenhouse,** with its ornate scrollwork and domed top, creates a dreamy backdrop for vows, as do the gracefully swaying Willow Trees. The cozy barn makes a sweet option for an intimate indoor ceremony.
  * **The breathtaking, light-filled Pavilion** hosts unforgettable receptions. Here, you’ll find a soaring open-rafter ceiling, a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace, a fantastic retro bar, and adjacent patios that are perfect for cocktails, overflow seating, or al fresco lounge areas.
