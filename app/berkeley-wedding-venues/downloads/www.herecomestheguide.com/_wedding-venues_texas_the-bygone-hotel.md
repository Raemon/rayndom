## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its perfect blend of nostalgic whimsy and modern comfort,** this 16-room boutique hotel**** is designed to encourage you to slow down, play hard, and connect. For a wedding weekend, it’s simply perfect: You’ll have access to the whole chic property and 5.5-acre grounds, plus full coordination to keep things running smoothly.
  * **The aptly named rooftop Sky Deck, with its sweeping Hill Country vistas,** is a favorite setting for ceremonies. After the “I do”s, make your way to the East Lawn with its adorably retro Airstream bar, cozy seating, and ample yard games, or opt for cocktails in the sleek, modern Den.
  * **The weekend-ready setup is made extra cushy** thanks to the stylish, light-filled guest rooms,**** each boasting blockbuster vistas, terrazzo accents, and vintage-inspired furnishings (ask about a record player!). A favorite amenity? The heated Hilltop Pool, perched high above the rolling landscape—it’s also a fabulous setting for al fresco receptions.
