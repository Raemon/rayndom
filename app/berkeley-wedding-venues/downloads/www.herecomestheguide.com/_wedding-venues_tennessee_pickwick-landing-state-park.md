## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **One of Tennessee State Parks’ hidden gems, this laid-back waterfront retreat** is tucked into the trees at the edge of Pickwick Lake, with an airy, modern lodge, shady forest trails, and plenty of open sky. It’s a peaceful spot that feels more like a nature escape than a formal venue.
  * **Gather for a ceremony on the lakeside lawn** or beneath the shade of a picturesque pavilion, then move indoors to the light-filled Magnolia Room, where tall windows frame the trees and local stonework adds rustic texture to the space.
  * **There’s plenty of space to settle in for a weekend.** The lodge boasts 119 cozy guest rooms (including a spacious suite perfect for the newlyweds), along with nearby cabins and camping for the adventurous among your party.
