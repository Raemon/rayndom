## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This lovely 1859 mansion has all the features of a classic Southern home:** a wraparound front porch, oak floors, delicate stained-glass windows, and a beautiful, winding staircase.
  * **Outdoor weddings take place in the lush garden** in front of a quaint gazebo. Follow with a reception in the stately grand ballroom, and during your event your guests can soak up the vintage ambiance as they mingle throughout the courtyard, parlors, tea room and banquet room.
  * **The fabulous dressing suites cater to every taste,** each with plenty of space to spread out. We especially love the detached cottage, which is outfitted with with plush leather furnishings perfect for a pre-ceremony hang.
