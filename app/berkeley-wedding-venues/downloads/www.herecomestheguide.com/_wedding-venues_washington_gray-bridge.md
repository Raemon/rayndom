## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Pacific Northwest beauty is on full display at this three-acre forest estate,** whose park-like grounds present unparalleled photo ops that include towering evergreens, peaceful meadows, and two lakes—one of which is spanned by the venue’s handsome namesake footbridge. 
  * **Super-romantic ceremonies happen in the lakeside amphitheater,** whose tiered seating provides guests with a dreamy view of the water. A grand dining tent just above the amphitheater allows you to host an entirely al fresco party, no matter the weather. 
  * **Herban Feast will provide your bespoke, farm-to-fork catering.** Their unforgettably yummy dishes feature produce grown in their own gardens at nearby Fox Hollow Farm. Food doesn’t get any more local than this!
