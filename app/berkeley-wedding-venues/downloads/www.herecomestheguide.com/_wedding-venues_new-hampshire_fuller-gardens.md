## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This historic, turn-of-the-century estate nestled by the seaside** has been transformed into an exquisite public garden, lush with heirloom roses, formal hedges, a Japanese garden, and a tropical conservatory. You might exchange vows on a verdant lawn or share a kiss beneath towering Japanese maples—every corner of this place feels like a storybook setting for romance.
  * **The entire gardens can be yours for an intimate, one-hour ceremony** **after closing,** or opt for a sun-kissed daytime elopement among the fragrant roses. After the “I do”s, stroll the garden paths to discover endless romantic photo ops—beside a tranquil koi pond, before a burbling fountain, or beside colorful succulents in the greenhouse.
  * **Experiencing the magic of the gardens is remarkably affordable** , with simple flat-rate pricing that includes chairs, setup, and teardown. Plus, the prime North Hampton location leaves plenty of flexibility for creating the rest of your big day, whether you keep it simple with the two of you or join your loved ones for a reception elsewhere.
