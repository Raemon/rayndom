## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This unique private event venue is located along a scenic route** of Old Spanish Trail, nestled against the Saguaro National Monument and surrounded by hundreds of the famous towering cacti. 
  * **Ceremonies are held on an elevated platform** that offers stunning uninterrupted views of the surrounding hills. A wrought-iron arch adds drama—you can drape it with fabric or flowers, or leave it unadorned for a charming, rustic look. 
  * **The modern banquet hall boasts floor-to-ceiling windows** and an attached terrace, so you can continue enjoying the breathtaking landscape (and the dozens of trees wrapped in twinkle lights) as the sun begins to set.
