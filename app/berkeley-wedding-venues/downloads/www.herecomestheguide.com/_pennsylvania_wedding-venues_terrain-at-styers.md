## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The restored antique Garden Shed is a charming, one-of-a-kind space,** outfitted with rustic wood-plank floors, vintage furnishings, and lush greenery in every nook and cranny. Just outside its walls, you'll find plenty of photo-worthy spots, including a romantic fire pit surrounded by verdant plantings, potted shrubs, and flagstone & brick accents.
  * **A tranquil walk through the nurseries leads to the secluded Ceremony Gardens,** where you'll exchange vows beneath the century-old wooden Wedding Temple and the arms of shady sycamores. In the cooler months, the refurbished Hot House is a picturesque alternative, with its lush living wall as your dreamy backdrop.
  * **Delectable, freshly prepared cuisine is guided by the seasonal harvest.** The talented culinary staff creates locally-inspired menus that range from formal plated meals to low-key family-style dining, paired with signature cocktails and hand-selected wines for a truly mouthwatering meal.
