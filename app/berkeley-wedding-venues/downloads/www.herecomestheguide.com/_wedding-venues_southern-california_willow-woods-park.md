## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Surrounded by ancient trees and dotted with landmark log cabins,** this picturesque mountain retreat offers a blend of rustic simplicity and natural elegance. Though initially created as an early 20th century logging camp, it's now been transformed into an intimate "village" for majestic forest weddings, all just one mile from Lake Arrowhead.
  * **Celebrations on the patio are illuminated by glowing bistro lights,** draped from the arms of shady oaks, pines, and dogwoods. Nestled amid wildflower gardens and historic stone-and-wood cabins, you'll feel spirited away to another time. There's even a charming log chapel for a lovely, vintage-inspired ceremony.
  * **You're welcome to design your day as you wish,** thanks to an open vendor policy and a generous event staff. If you'd rather keep it simple with in-house catering, though, you're in luck: they're located right next to LouEddie's Pizza & Brewery, widely known for crafting some of the best artisan pizza in the country (vegan and gluten-free options are all equally delicious!).
