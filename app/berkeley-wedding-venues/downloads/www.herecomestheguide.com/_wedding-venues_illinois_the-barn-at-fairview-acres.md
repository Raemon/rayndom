## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Surrounded by 80 acres of row crop farmland, conservation reserve, and native wildflower fields,** this unique venue boasts a modern-farm aesthetic and tons of style. One of our favorite features: the repurposed, 18,000-bushel Grain Bin, which serves as both a day-of prep area and a romantic honeymoon suite.
  * **The Barn is absolutely breathtaking,** with a two-story prep lounge, dozens of windows, a soaring ceiling with whitewashed exposed rafters, delicate chandelier lighting, and a grand double staircase.
  * **Your budget will thank you—** they offer so many wonderful extras in their packages, including beautiful décor elements, a courtesy van for your wedding party, and so much more.
