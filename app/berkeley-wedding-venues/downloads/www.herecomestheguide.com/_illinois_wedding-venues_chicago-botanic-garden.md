## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This stunning 385-acre garden boasts 26 display gardens and four natural areas,** all situated on nine islands conveniently located close to downtown Chicago. Photo opportunities are everywhere, thanks to a wealth of flower-bordered paths, treelined walkways, water features, quaint bridges and world-renowned horticultural displays.
  * **Romance is a key ingredient of outdoor venues** like the English Walled Garden and fragrant Rose Terrace, both perfect for ceremonies, and the canopied McGinley Pavilion sits at water’s edge and overlooks Evening Island. 
  * **Dine and dance in the grand Nichols Hall,** with its dramatic two-story skylight, the Krehbiel Gallery, set off by a stone reflecting pool, or in one of the other glorious event halls. Catering is provided by _Levy Restaurants_ , who offers a selection of wedding packages and is happy to customize your menu, too.
