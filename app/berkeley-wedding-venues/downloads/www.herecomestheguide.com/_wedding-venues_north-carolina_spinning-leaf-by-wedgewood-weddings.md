## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **An authentic wine country experience awaits at this working vineyard, tucked in the lush hills of Shelby, North Carolina.** Spinning Leaf by Wedgewood Weddings welcomes all couples to celebrate amidst the scenic surroundings, and savor this enchanting blend of rustic charm and sophisticated elegance. 
  * **The Vineyard Garden features quite the romantic ceremony spot--a handcrafted wooden pergola with string lighting, fresh floral décor and sweeping vineyard views.** Then while you capture photos among the grapevines, your guests gather for cocktails on a spacious stone terrace where sunsets and market lights cast a festive glow. Mingling naturally flows inside to the adjacent Harvest Lounge, whose timber walls and soaring pine ceiling create a warm, intimate atmosphere.
  * **Receptions take on a distinctive sense of occasion inside the Grand Hall,** a handsome space that boasts a dramatic lighting installation: a cascade of Edison-bulb chandeliers that’s sure to elevate your wedding style. But perhaps the best part of Spinning Leaf is the experienced and caring team at Wedgewood Weddings who are dedicated to helping you customize a spectacular event that makes the most of a spectacular venue.
