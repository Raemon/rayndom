## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The Japanese Tea House next to a tranquil pond is a picturesque spot** for a shady summertime wedding, while the Fragrance Garden, dotted with scented flowers, is idyllic for a garden ceremony.
  * **For a unique outdoor option, consider reserving the South Terrace** —it's outfitted with bistro lights and can be used for a formal al fresco reception or food trucks! Indoor dining and dancing can take place in the Auditorium, which has breathtaking views of the azalea gardens, pond, and Overlook from 75-foot windows.
  * **This 50-acre garden oasis, only 35 minutes from downtown D.C.,** offers plenty of flexible packages for nature-loving couples, from intimate ceremonies to expansive, full-day affairs. Whatever you choose, each package includes access to the whole property for romantic photos.
