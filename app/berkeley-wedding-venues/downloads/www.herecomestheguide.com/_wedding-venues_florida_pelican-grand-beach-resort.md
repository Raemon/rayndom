## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You can get married by the water…** Say “I do” next to the Atlantic Ocean on the resort’s private beach, or have a poolside ceremony.
  * **…Or exchange vows on a romantic Rooftop Terrace.** The North and South Rooftop Terraces both feature a gazebo overlooking the ocean, with beautiful stargazing opportunities at night! The tented Atlantic Pavilion just steps from the beach and the elegant Everglades Room are available for indoor ceremonies and receptions.
  * **There’s nothing like living the resort experience.** Sip “Classic Reinvented Cocktails” while soaking up the sun and views from the verandah or restaurant Ocean2000’s outdoor terrace. The kids will love floating around the Lazy River and dropping by the Emporium for ice cream. A long list of activities includes paddleboarding, snorkeling, ocean or river kayaking, parasailing and more! And when there’s a full moon, Ocean2000 offers an Evening Under the Moon with al fresco dining enhanced night-sky viewing through a telescope and table visits from an astrologer/spiritual healer.
