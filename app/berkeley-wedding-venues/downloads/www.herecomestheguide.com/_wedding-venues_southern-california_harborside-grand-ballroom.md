## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched on the second floor of the iconic Balboa Pavilion, this Victorian-era ballroom** boasts some of the best views of Newport Harbor. Originally designed as America's answer to the palatial dance halls of early 20th-century Europe, the expansive room boasts a huge dance floor, two bars, and an elegant, wide staircase from the front entryway that creates a beautiful stage for a photogenic entrance.
  * **Floor-to-ceiling windows line every inch of the ballroom on three sides,** framing sweeping views out to Newport Bay. Just outside the larger of the bars there's a glass-protected terrace—perfect for catching a breath of fresh air and admiring the classic charm of the soft sand beach, wooden pier, and quaint shops of beautiful Balboa.
  * **The gracious hospitality and attention to detail extends to the experienced staff,** who will assist you with every aspect of your event, from customizing your menu to helping you choose the right linens. They're also skilled at bringing to life whatever celebration you have in mind, be it a formal black-tie affair, a contemporary beach-themed wedding or a rousing casino night.
