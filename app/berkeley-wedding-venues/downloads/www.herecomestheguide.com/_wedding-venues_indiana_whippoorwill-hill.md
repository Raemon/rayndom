## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Just six miles outside Bloomington,** this family-run spot is part historic landmark, part pretty farm, and part tasteful event venue, boasting 156 rolling acres, two barns, and a turn-of-the-century farmhouse. 
  * **Exchange vows at your choice of several pretty outdoor spots** (there's always indoor back up in case of rain), then celebrate in the stunning two-story wedding barn, which features covered patios on each side overlooking the gorgeous grounds. 
  * **Seven overnight guests can be accommodated at the Sanders Store,** an iconic shop along Fairfax Road just adjacent to Whipporwill Hill. It's been lovingly renovated to highlight its industrial-chic design features, and makes a perfect "home base" for wedding weekend activities.
