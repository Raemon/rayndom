## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **There’s so much prettiness packed into these five dreamy acres!** As you and your guests meander about the lush property, you’ll find rose gardens, meadows, waterfalls, quiet walking paths, and so much more. 
  * **And there are so many ways to celebrate:** opt for a ceremony beneath the Greek-inspired arbor, a party under the newly-built Pavilion, a cocktail party on the sandy beach…that's just a start, and your only trouble will be narrowing down your favorites! 
  * **The entire space is exclusively yours for the day,** allowing you a generous amount of time for decorating and dressing. Two beautiful, light-filled suites are available for your morning preparations.
