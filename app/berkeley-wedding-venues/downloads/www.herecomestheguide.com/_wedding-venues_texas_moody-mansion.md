## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Built in the late 1800s, this stately mansion on the northeastern edge of Galveston Island** is a beautifully preserved example of Gilded Age splendor. Now operating as a museum, it offers a glimpse into the lives of a prominent Texas family.
  * **The entire first floor (including a gorgeous ballroom)** may be used for celebrations, allowing guests to meander throughout the elegant rooms and gracious porches. Outside, there’s a pretty lawn and brick terrace that may be tented or outdoor affairs.
  * **Private tours of the home** (either self-guided or docent-led) may be arranged during your event, covering its first two floors and collection of art and furnishings, all of which belonged to the Moody Family. Plus, your rental fees help support the museum and its umbrella charitable foundation.
