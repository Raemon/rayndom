## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set in Savannah's beautiful countryside** (but only ten minutes from its beloved historic district), this family-run, 125-acre rural estate features lovely natural grounds and three separate, thoughtfully customized venues.
  * **The Barn is so charming,** with enchanting details like a ceiling draped in thousands of twinkle lights, and two horse stalls that have been transformed into “Tricky’s Bar”. Outside, you’ll find a lovely space for ceremonies beneath a giant, moss-draped oak, as well as an inviting outdoor lounge space. 
  * **Once used as a storehouse,** The Grainery is now a rustic-modern reception hall, with stylish industrial-inspired elements and an outdoor area overlooking the lake. The Belle Tower is the traditional home at the property’s heart; intimate celebrations can take advantage of its gracious interior, amply sized lawn, and classic front porch.
