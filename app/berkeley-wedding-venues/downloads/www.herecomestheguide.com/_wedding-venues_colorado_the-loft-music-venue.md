## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's a cool, urban-chic space at the heart of Old Colorado City.** Your guests will love the festive vibe, and the fact that it's close to the area's most popular attractions, including Red Rocks Amphitheater, Garden of the Gods, and Pikes Peak.
  * **The interior features exposed brick walls, a vaulted ceiling** with exposed beams, large windows, and rich hardwood floors. 
  * **Packages start with "Bare Bricks Essentials"** (a DIY option that lets you take care of most of the details), but can be expanded to include just about everything you'd need, from DJ services to cocktails in the swanky Vault.
