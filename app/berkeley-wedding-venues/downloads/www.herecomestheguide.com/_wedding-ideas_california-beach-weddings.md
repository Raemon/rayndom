# California Beach Weddings: 14 Locations Where You Can Tie The Knot On The Sand!

## 

**If it's an authentic beach wedding you're after, then any one of these coastal California venues will arrange it for you**. From the sun-drenched shores of San Diego to Northern California's Muir Beach with its forest backdrop, these romantic spots allow you to say your vows on the beach. Not _next_ to the beach, not overlooking the beach, but actually right _on the sand._

### San Diego, CA

[ [ Camila Margotta Photography ](https://camilamargotta.com/) ](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/southern-california/san-diego-mission-bay-resort)

**San Diego Mission Bay Resort's beach ceremony spot is one of the region's loveliest,** with Mission Bay's tranquil waters lapping at the shore and sailboats gliding by gracefully in the distance—an iconic snapshot of "America's Finest City", to be sure. For a celebration with a decidedly South Seas twist, consider the exquisite Garden by the Bay, where towering palm trees form a natural wedding arch, or the Bayside Terrace, with its cascading waterfall and striking 60-year-old ficus tree.

**Spectacular weddings nestled between the sea, sand, and sky** are the specialty of this gorgeous waterfront resort.

The indoor spaces are no less lovely, with plenty of options to suit every taste. For something traditional, opt for the sprawling Huntington Ballroom with its coffered ceiling; the chic Breakwater Ballroom is a touch more contemporary, with modern chandeliers and ocean-blue flooring. The Coastal Ballroom and Pacific Ballroom each have their own adjacent terrace, offering your guests the chance to watch a once-in-a-lifetime sunset in between dinner and dancing.
