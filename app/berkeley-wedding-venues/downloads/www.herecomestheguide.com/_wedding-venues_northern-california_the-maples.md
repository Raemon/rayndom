## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Discover this enchanting private estate, nestled on 55 acres of gorgeous grounds** in sweet Woodland, CA. Anchored by a 1930s ranch house, thoughtfully restored to showcase its original charm, the entire impressive property is all yours on your big day, allowing you to embrace the seclusion and natural beauty its original owners once enjoyed.
  * **Exchange vows on the lawn, surrounded by lush botanical plantings and century-old trees.** Our favorite spot is beneath the arms of a soaring Chinese pistache, whose delicately feathered foliage beautifully filters the sunlight to create a truly magical atmosphere. Alternately, say "I do" before the historic Stables, where classic arched green doors offer a charming vintage backdrop.
  * **Sip cocktails by the pool or mingle in the original fireplace area,** bounded by beautiful stone half-walls with built-in benches perfect for snuggling. Guests can play bocce ball and horseshoes on the lawn until it's time for dinner & dancing: the nearby courtyard, draped with bistro lights and anchored by its own dramatic brick fireplace, seems made for al fresco soirees.
