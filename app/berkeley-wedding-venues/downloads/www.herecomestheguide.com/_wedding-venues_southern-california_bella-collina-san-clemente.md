## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled in a private valley that evokes the rustic charm of a Tuscan vineyard,** this picturesque club and golf course is truly lovely. Encompassing 240 acres of open space dotted with ponds, wooden bridges, pines, and weeping willows, the photo ops are endless... and you'll even have a private chauffeur to help you find the best spots.
  * **A pretty brick walkway leads to the tiered amphitheater,** where you'll exchange vows surrounded by views of colorful blooms, manicured greens, and rolling hills. Continue al fresco with a celebration on a gracious lawn framed by organic vegetable gardens, rose gardens, bocce ball and horseshoe courts.
  * **The chic upper clubhouse is all yours on the wedding day.** Start with cocktails in the Bella Vista Cocktail Lounge, which is outfitted with a built-in bar, a cozy fireplace, and sliding walls that open onto the window-lined Ballroom. Packages are inclusive and flexible, featuring epicurean delights, elegant furnishings, and the talents of their wonderful in-house events team.
