## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The Victorian-inspired resort is the first of its kind** in Colorado's Wine Country. Tucked in a pretty valley and completely surrounded by a working vineyard, the property offers outstanding views of Grand Mesa.
  * **There are dozens of indoor and outdoor venue options.** One of our favorites is the Pavilion, whose sweet cupola creates the feel of a vintage carriage house. Exchange vows here, then move to the Vineyard Ballroom, where floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the vines.
  * **You'll love spending your day prepping in Rose Room** , which was designed specifically with weddings in mind. It's got ideal lighting for makeup, and a commercial shampoo sink and styling chair—they'll even bring in a massage therapist to help you relax!
