## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Situated on the picturesque, secluded grounds of Stone Gables Estate,** this old world-inspired venue offers a host of elegant indoor and outdoor spaces, all surrounded by lush meadows, manicured gardens, and mature trees.
  * **The Grande Gazebo features whitewashed woodwork and a charming steeple,** while the wrought-iron scrollwork of the domed Victorian Gazebo evokes the feel of an English garden. Follow with a lavish celebration beneath the Grande Canopy Tuscan Tent, or an intimate dinner in the glass-walled Solarium.
  * **Your on-site lodging options are simply wonderful,** and include a restored 1860s farmhouse, two cozy cottages, and a 1920s manor home, which now serves as the Klein Mansion Inn.
