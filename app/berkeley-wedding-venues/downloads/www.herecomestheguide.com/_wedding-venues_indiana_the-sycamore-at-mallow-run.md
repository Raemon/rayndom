## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Surrounded by acres of vineyards** and beautiful natural grounds, this private event venue—set at the heart of Mallow Run Winery—offers tons of options for celebrations of all sizes, and is just 20 miles south of Indianapolis.
  * **Their unique outdoor ceremony space has the feel of an al fresco chapel,** with a peaked roof and backdrop of lush mature trees. Once you’ve said “I do”, you and your guests can toast the day with cocktails in the Gallery, the Sycamore’s light-filled foyer which flows to an adjacent string-lit patio with a cozy fire pit.
  * **Grand affairs are a dream in the Estate Room,** where you’ll find a soaring, timber-trussed ceiling, pillars and fireplaces of stacked stone, and large windows overlooking the grounds. More intimate gatherings are perfect for the inviting Homestead Room, which offers a taste of the property’s history and lovely views of its native namesake sycamore trees.
