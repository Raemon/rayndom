## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This 88.7-acre working farm was once home to fruit orchards** and dairy cows. Today, the lawn behind the 1858 mansion provides an outdoor ceremony site with a picturesque vineyard vista.
  * **You have a choice of several unique spaces:** The Winery Building’s Tasting Room and main floor work well for a cocktail or seated dinner for up to 100. There’s also the stone-walled Cave Room, where wine barrel tables lend a rustic touch, and carriage house doors open to the patio and vineyard views.
  * **Larger events may be held al fresco on the brick patio,** which comes with a peaked tent outfitted with twinkle lights, chandeliers, and palladian side windows.
