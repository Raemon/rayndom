## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Situated at the outer edge of Liberty Landing Marina** , this chic restaurant offers sparkling views of the Manhattan skyline and dramatic contemporary architecture, a combo that makes for fantastic photos. 
  * **Both of the light, airy event spaces** —The Sky Room and The Aviary—feature wraparound outdoor terraces where guests can savor unobstructed Hudson River vistas.
  * **The ever-evolving, chef-designed menu** is a modern spin on the "classic coastal fish house", with a focus on local, organic, and sustainable ingredients.
