## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **European elegance meets Southern hospitality** at this stunning luxury hotel in Dallas’ Uptown District. From the ornate, cast aluminum trellises and Welsh slate roofing adorning the exterior to the Italian and Spanish marble inside, the building has an irresistible Old World flair.
  * **Exchange vows in the lush private courtyard** , which is filled with flowers and greenery year-round. For a memorable indoor ceremony, opt for the Crescent Club on the 17th floor. It’s paneled in rich, dark wood and offers sparkling views of the city.
  * **The opulent Crescent Ballroom provides a lavish backdrop** for a grand reception, thanks to silk-lined walls, intimate chandelier lighting, sumptuously draped windows, and a gleaming gold-coffered ceiling.
