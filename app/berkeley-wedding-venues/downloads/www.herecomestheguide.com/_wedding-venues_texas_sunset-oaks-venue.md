## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Situated on a pretty expanse** **just a few miles from both Tyler and Lindale,** this well-appointed venue has it all: stylish indoor and outdoor gathering spaces, beautiful photo opportunities, and a top-notch event team.
  * **The dedicated Wedding Chapel is so lovely,** with its whitewashed shiplap, church windows, and airy open sides. Continue your celebration in the modern farmhouse-inspired reception hall, whose chic design and spacious layout set the scene for a perfect party. 
  * **Their pricing is blissfully transparent****and refreshingly reasonable—** no hidden charges here—and their flexible packages include lots of great extras, like custom-built farmhouse tables and a ton of decorations in a range of styles.
