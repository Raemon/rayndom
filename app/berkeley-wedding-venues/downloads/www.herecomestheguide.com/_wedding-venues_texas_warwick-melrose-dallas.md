## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Since its debut in 1924, this exquisite hotel** has been the site of the city's most prestigious events for nearly a century. Now part of the Warwick Hotels and Resorts collection, it remains a timeless landmark in vibrant Uptown Dallas, and exemplifies a long tradition of gracious hospitality and an atmosphere of elegance and sophistication
  * **The sophisticated Turtle Creek Grand Ballroom beautifully blends past and present,** thanks to soaring 16-foot ceilings, Art Deco-style chandeliers, and refined, modern décor. With its own private entrance through the promenade, the stage is set for your dazzling grand entrance.
  * **The Crystal Ballroom evokes the charm of time gone by,** with mirrored pillars that soar toward a ceiling adorned with shimmering crystal chandeliers. Intimate events are particularly lovely in the Bridewell Suite, which opens onto a magnificent terrace overlooking Oak Lawn Avenue.
