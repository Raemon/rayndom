## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled on the second floor of a century-old Classical Revival building** in the heart of downtown Raleigh, this chic urban venue blends modern vibes with turn-of-the-century charm, with exposed brick walls, hardwood floors, and a lattice beam ceiling.
  * **Spacious and flexible, this gorgeous venue** can comfortably host your ceremony and reception, whether you opt for an intimate dinner or cocktail-style socializing. Tables and chairs are included, as is a sound system with a wireless microphone.
  * **The bright, airy Glass Box penthouse provides one of two lovely spaces** for wedding party preparations. Filled with natural light from the floor-to-ceiling windows, the warm, inviting suite overlooks the city and features a private outdoor balcony.
