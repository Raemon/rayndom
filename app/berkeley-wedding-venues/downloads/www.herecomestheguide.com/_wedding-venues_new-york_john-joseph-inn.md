## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This charming 19th-century estate** is spread across 110 acres of Finger Lakes beauty. It features both indoor and outdoor event options, and all menus are thoughtfully and creatively curated by owner and executive chef John Hamilton.
  * **A graceful peaked-arch arbor frames your vows** in a lush, woodsy ceremony space. Follow with cocktails overlooking the sprawling orchards, then celebrate in the vintage Carriage House or English Garden ballroom tent.
  * **The Inn boasts six graciously appointed rooms and suites,** making it a great choice for weekend accommodations. For a larger group or family, there’s the darling Cook’s Cottage, which has a small kitchen and wood-burning stove.
