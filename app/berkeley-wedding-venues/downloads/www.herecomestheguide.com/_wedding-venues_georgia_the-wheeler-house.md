## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This stunning 1906 mansion and its surrounding grounds can host events year-round,** with plenty of options for celebrations indoors and out. The home itself was lovingly restored a few years ago, and serves as a memorable focal point wherever you choose to hold your wedding.
  * **Say "I do" in the custom-built arbor,** with its three crystal chandeliers and simple frame hung with graceful swaths of billowing fabric. Stay here to keep the party entirely al fresco, or move inside to the beautiful barn, which was constructed of reclaimed wood—some was originally part of a Panama City airport runway!
  * **Each of their darling cottages sleeps 8–10 guests** and you're sure to be charmed by their stylish shabby-chic interiors, which boast full kitchens, ample gathering space, and some of the prettiest views on the property.
