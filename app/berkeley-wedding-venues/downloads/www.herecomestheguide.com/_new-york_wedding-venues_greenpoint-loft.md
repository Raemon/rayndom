## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its rich wood flooring, multi-paned, high-set windows,** and soaring ceiling supported by wood and steel trusses, this historic Brooklyn loft is a stylish combo of barn house charm and industrial-chic glam. 
  * **We’re big fans of the Rooftop,** which is accessible via the main building and offers incredible views of the city skyline across the East River. Use if for a dreamy open-air ceremony, or an unforgettable al fresco cocktail hour. 
  * **It’s part of the** _BKVenues_**collection,** which specializes in historic and culturally unique event spaces. The _BKVenues_ team are true stewards of these significant spots, and the staff prides itself on ensuring every celebration feels as special as the couple hosting it.
