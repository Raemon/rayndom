## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A chic, rustic-modern restaurant with an avid local following,** this welcoming spot is just an hour from NYC, Newark, and Philadelphia, with plenty of lodging and entertainment options in surrounding Freehold. 
  * **Every event room is gracious and stylish,** with design details like raindrop pendant light fixtures, inset fire features, and walls of stacked stone and reclaimed wooden shiplap. 
  * **They offer some very cool room enhancements.** Our favorite: an interactive mirror photo booth that lets you send pics right to your phone.
