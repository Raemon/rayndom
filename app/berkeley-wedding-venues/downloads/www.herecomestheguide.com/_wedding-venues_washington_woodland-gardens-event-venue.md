## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **True to its name, this dreamy spot** (owned and operated by a sweet mother-daughter team) features acres of towering trees and manicured gardens that form a lush, woodsy oasis, blissfully removed from ordinary life. 
  * **Grand celebrations may opt for The Orchard,** nestled between mature fruit trees and a veggie garden, or The Madrona, with its gentle lawn surrounded by pines and ferns. The Pond and The Grove, which are just right for smaller parties, each feel sweet and secluded, creating a distinct “secret garden” feel. 
  * **We adore the artisan-crafted outdoor bar,** with its rustic-chic vibe and slanted roof bedecked with bistro lights. Boasting room for multiple bartenders, it’s the perfect hub for a charming al fresco cocktail hour.
