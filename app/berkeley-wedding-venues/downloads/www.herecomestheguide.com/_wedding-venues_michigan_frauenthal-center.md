## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Sparkling like a hidden piece of Broadway history on the shores of Lake Michigan,** this historic theater glimmers with gilded ceilings, velvet seats, and original 1920s architecture that brings instant drama to your day. Set in downtown Muskegon, it’s just blocks from the lakefront and buzzing with artsy energy.
  * **You can say your vows center stage beneath the glowing spotlights,** then join your guests for cocktail hour mingling in the Art Deco-inspired Reception Gallery, which opens onto a breezy deck with views of the city, or the clubby, modern Frau Lounge. It’s easy to transition into dinner in the adjacent ballroom, with its rough-hewn wood beams and glittering chandeliers.
  * **It’s a one-of-a-kind space at a surprisingly affordable price,** thanks to flexible spaces that scale beautifully for both micro-wedding and grand soirees, in-house bar service and your choice of preferred caterers, and a committed team to help you bring the pieces together.
