##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You'll enjoy panoramic views of the city and field** in this private club located on the east side of the Jones AT&T Texas Tech football stadium. Floor-to-ceiling windows let natural light flow into the event spaces, which overlook both the gridiron and downtown Lubbock.
  * **There are multiple rooms to choose from and combine** according to your needs. They can accommodate both your ceremony and reception, with banquet chairs, tables, a wood-tiled dance floor, wedding party room, and more included with the rental.
  * **Gourmet in-house catering with customizable menus** , plus cake cutting, coffee service, and a champagne toast, make planning seamless. And the attentive staff will work with you to personalize everything from linens and floral arrangements to the hors d'oeuvres display.
