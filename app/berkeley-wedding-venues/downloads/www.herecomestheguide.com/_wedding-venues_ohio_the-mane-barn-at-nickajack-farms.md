## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Just west of Canton and set amid 200 acres of rolling countryside,** this family-run, working farm is a favorite local destination, known for hosting seasonal festivals, exciting tours and school trips, and warm celebrations.
  * **Spend your morning prepping in the charming dressing suite,** then meet your love in The Chapel, the farm’s romantic outdoor ceremony space. Here, you’ll wed at an “altar” constructed of reclaimed barn wood, with the pastures and fields as your backdrop.
  * **The renovated reception barn is simply stunning,** with a peaked, cupola-topped roof, accents of rich wood, a full-length bar, and a split staircase that leads to a second-story mezzanine overlooking the main floor.
