# 8 Denver/Boulder Area Wedding Venues with Majestic Mountain Views

## 

**If mountain views are a must for your wedding, then Denver and Boulder should suit you perfectly.** The mountain panorama from the mile-high city is 140 miles long and includes 200 named peaks! Boulder is located at the base of the Rocky Mountain foothills and offers up its own version of mountain magnificence. Yup, when you host your celebration here you're definitely surrounded by the alpine beauty Colorado is famous for. And if you plan to stay the weekend, accommodations run the gamut from historic cabins with fireplaces to luxurious guest rooms outfitted with soaking tubs. And don't forget, altitude does have its perks: golf balls _and_ cocktails go 10 percent farther up here!
