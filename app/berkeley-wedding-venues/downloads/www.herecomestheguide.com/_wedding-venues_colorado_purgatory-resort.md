## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Though it’s just 25 miles north of Durango,** this all-season resort in the San Juan Mountains boasts incredible views, gorgeous photo opportunities across its unspoiled wilderness, and a charming central village with lodging, shopping, dining, and nightlife.
  * **With several unique ceremony and reception spaces to choose from,** you’ll find just the right spot. Two of our picks: Purgy’s, a modern alpine lodge-style hall with towering windows overlooking the slopes, and Paradise, a breathtaking spot for intimate vows, accessible by chair lift.
  * **There’s a broad range of on-site accommodations** in and around the resort, highlighted by plush condo rentals in an array of sizes. And though Purgatory may be best known for its winter activities, summer guests can fill their days with hiking, mountain biking, an alpine slide, and water fun on nearby Twilight Lake.
