## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The mountaintop resort is breathtaking.** Located just a few miles from Aspen and in the heart of Snowmass Village, it sits at the foot of one of the world’s most desirable ski mountains. It’s not just for winter lovers, though—in addition to luxurious accommodations, you’ll find an indulgent spa, decadent dining, and year-round activities for all interests.
  * **The event spaces are flexible and beautiful.** Whether you’d like to celebrate indoors, outdoors, or both, Viceroy Snowmass has something you’ll love. The elegant Grand Ballroom boasts huge windows overlooking the mountains, and a lovely adjacent mountainside terrace. The expansive Nest Patio & Deck makes the most of the resort’s stellar location, with outstanding views as the backdrop for both ceremonies and receptions.
  * **You’ll be treated to some very special extras.** Packages include helpful perks, like discounted rates on wedding shower or rehearsal dinners. And when you book your wedding at Vicery Snowmass, you’ll receive a complimentary wedding night stay along with discount offers at the other beautiful Viceroy locations.
