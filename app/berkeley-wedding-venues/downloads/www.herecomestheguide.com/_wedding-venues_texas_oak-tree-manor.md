## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Built in 1876 by German immigrants,** this beautiful home takes its name from the century-old oak trees that surround it—two of which have been added to the Harris County Tree Registry. 
  * **Weddings have been held under the 200-year-old oak tree for generations.** Local folklore deems that marriages that begin under its sprawling branches will be blessed with happiness, children, and long-lasting love. 
  * **Celebrate your "I dos" with an al fresco reception on the lawn** or move indoors to the charming reception hall at the manor, where you'll find a sweeping double staircase, gleaming blonde wood flooring, a sparkling chandelier, and a dramatic wrought-iron balcony overlooking the entire room.
