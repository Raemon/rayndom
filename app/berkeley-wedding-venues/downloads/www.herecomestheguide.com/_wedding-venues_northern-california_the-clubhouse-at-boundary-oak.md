## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nature abounds at this premier Walnut Creek venue,** named for a particularly majestic and artfully gnarled 350-year-old tree that presides over the property from its hilltop perch. Sitting on acres of manicured greens, the expansive course is bordered by open space and ringed by an extensive network of rustic, ridgeline trails.
  * **Sunlight shimmers off the pretty water feature alongside the Lakeview Ceremony Site,** where you can exchange vows amid a towering stand of eucalyptus trees and the surrounding fairways. Toast with bubbly al fresco, or mingle with your loved ones in the light-filled Atrium, lined with rows of slanted skylights, before transitioning into the beautifully decorated Celebration Ballroom, which easily hosts 250 for dinner and dancing.
  * **Another option is the architecturally dramatic Vista Room,** which is adjacent to the pretty, multilevel Mira Room (a fabulous setting for cocktails). This space is cantilevered above the walkway below with three walls of windows that angle outwards, making the outdoors feel like part of the room. A pyramid-style ceiling completes the whole "mid-century modernist" feel.
