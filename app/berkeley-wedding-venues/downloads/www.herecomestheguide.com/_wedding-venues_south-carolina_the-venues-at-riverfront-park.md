  * **Set on the banks of the Cooper River,** this charming public park (once home to Charleston Naval Base) boasts beautiful walking trails, a pier and dock, and beautifully preserved historic buildings. 
  * **Hold your ceremony in Eternal Father of the Sea Chapel,** where you’ll find whitewashed exposed ceiling trusses, original wood flooring, and pews, and dramatic, multi-paned windows running along each side wall.
