## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Fairy-tale magic meets Southern charm at this private estate,** set on 10 acres of peaceful Florida countryside. Ceremonies unfold beneath the arching branches of an ancient oak, followed by receptions in the elegant Belle Marquee tent or on the lovely Tuscan Patio.
  * **Every inch of the property is custom-crafted for romantic weddings,** which means photo ops are endless: Snap pre-ceremony pics in the Cinderella carriage, share a kiss with your love before the heart-shaped arbor, perch on a floral bicycle-for-two, or make a wish on the fountain of love.
  * **Curated and build-your-own package options ensure your day is just as you dream it…** all at a price you’ll love. Opt to rent just one of the venue’s spaces, or enjoy exclusive use of the entire estate, from prep in a plush dressing room to an afterparty at Huey’s, with its playful beer garden vibe.
