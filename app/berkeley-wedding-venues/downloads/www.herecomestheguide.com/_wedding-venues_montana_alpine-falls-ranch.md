## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Embrace the rugged natural beauty of Montana at this Michelin-starred private ranch** resort, where you’ll find the perfect destination wedding mix: year round adventure (hiking, horseback riding, skiing, fly fishing, and so much more), gorgeous event spaces, and a luxe selection of accommodations, dining, and entertainment. 
  * **Sprawling mountain meadows and gardens offer unforgettable ceremony settings,** while the ranch’s stylish residences can create sweet scenes for elopements. The awesome Six8 Saloon brings elevated lodge vibes to indoor celebrations, with exposed log rafters, country-cool design pops, and an attached deck overlooking the creek. 
  * **A collection of overnight options include cabins, a villa, a chalet, and a bunkhouse,** all decked out in upscale, Western-chic décor and offering incredible views of the property. Let the staff arrange a weekend (or longer!) worth of exciting activities for your whole group…and definitely don’t forget to set aside some time of visit the darling miniature donkeys and fluffy Highland cows.
