## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This former 1906 trolley substation has been transformed into a loft-like architectural gem,** with exposed steel beams, original brickwork (still bearing scorch marks from a fire in the '80s), and a dramatic open staircase that leads to a fabulous wraparound mezzanine. A cool contemporary chandelier is draped from the 45-foot ceilings, beautifully bringing the style into the modern day.
  * **Massive barn doors connect the main space to a gorgeous landscaped courtyard,** accented by elevated lounge furniture and glowing bistro lights. An industrial-deco fountain sits at one end, embraced by lovely, wild plantings, offering a picturesque setting for your al fresco ceremony.
  * **The authentic character of the space provides plenty of flexibility** , and the generous vendor policy ensures plenty of creative freedom. Treat your guests to an outdoor dining experience serviced by a food truck or mobile bar, or outfit the grand event space with thousands of twinkle lights for a magical evening dance party... the possibilities are endless.
