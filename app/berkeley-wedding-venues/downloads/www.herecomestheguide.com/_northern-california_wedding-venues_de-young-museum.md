## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

For an event as captivating as a work of art, the de Young Museum is unquestionably the right venue. Founded in 1895 and situated in the heart of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, the completely redesigned museum has been transformed into an ultra-cool contemporary frame for fine art and outstanding functions. 

Entrance is through the courtyard installation by famed sculptor Andy Goldsworthy. An invitingly lit lobby, featuring Italian stone floors and Ruth Asawa sculptures, is a fitting place to greet guests with champagne before whisking them up nine stories to the Hamon Observation Tower. Here, surrounded by walls of glass, delighted celebrants can savor cocktails, hors d'oeuvres, and music. While mingling, they'll admire unimpeded 360-degree panoramic views of San Francisco's downtown skyline, the Golden Gate Bridge, the sparkling Pacific, and Golden Gate Park. 

Your guests will also be impressed by the spectacular architecture of the concourse-level event spaces and galleries. The walls soar two stories high in dramatic Wilsey Court, a perfect fit for an über-elegant wedding reception, dinner dance, or upscale corporate affair. Designed by renowned Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron, its inspired use of angles, openness, and art gives the space a fluid vitality. A grand staircase to the upper galleries is ideal for regal entrances and photo ops. And don't forget that you can include the de Young's magnificent exhibitions, if you choose. The adjacent Piazzoni Murals Room, with burnished Italian landscapes adorning its walls, can serve as a special lounge, a separate bar and entertainment area, or an exclusive private chamber for more intimate gatherings. 

But why stop there? For an artsy vibe with a whimsical twist, take your party to the de Young Café, de Young Terrace, and Barbro Osher Sculpture Garden, which can be used separately or in combination. Have your ceremony on the broad sculpture garden lawn amid playful artworks and fanciful landscaping, host cocktails on the adjacent terrace, then dine and dance in the café. One of the museum's most popular event spaces, it transforms to suit your mood: casual, formal, festive, or even sultry. Striking touches like the colorful hand-blown glass lamps suspended overhead remind you that no matter where you go in the de Young art is everywhere, contributing a dynamic dimension to your celebration.
