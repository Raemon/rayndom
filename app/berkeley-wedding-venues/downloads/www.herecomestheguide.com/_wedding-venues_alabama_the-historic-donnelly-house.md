## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This showstopping 1905 Georgian-colonial mansion** , located in the Highland Avenue Historic District, provides a gorgeous example of neoclassical architecture, with a massive portico supported by columns and a red brick façade that provides a striking contrast.
  * **There are multiple ceremony sites to choose from** , such as the Gazebo Garden, the back patio, the front lawn, and the meticulously restored interior of the house, which features dark wood paneling, sparkling chandeliers, and white marble flooring. 
  * **Private preparation suites for both wedding parties** are a part of every package. A variety of tables, white padded chairs for outdoor use, gold Chiavari chairs for indoor use, on-site staff members, and setup and cleanup are also included.
