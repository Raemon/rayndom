## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The two-story Grande Hall is designed in the style of a classic wood barn** , with a 20-foot ceiling hung with oversized wrought-iron chandeliers, and a double staircase that descends from a wraparound balcony to the spacious main floor. Rows of windows and French doors let in natural light and Hill Country views.
  * **Two outdoor spaces are attached to the Hall** , and can be used for ceremonies, cocktails, or as overflow areas for your reception. The covered, open-sided Pavilion is like a rustic al fresco ballroom offering gorgeous views of the valley, while the expansive Patio is strung with bistro lights and accented by vintage street lamps.
  * **You’ll adore the Farmhouse** , which is a private guest house decked out with soft couches, a cozy fireplace, and a porch set with rocking chairs. It’s the perfect spot to steal a little quiet time with your favorite people before the bustle of the day begins.
