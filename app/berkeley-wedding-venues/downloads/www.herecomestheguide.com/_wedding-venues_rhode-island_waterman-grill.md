## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s got a breathtaking riverfront location.** Set in a prime spot along the Seekonk River, this sophisticated restaurant has unobstructed views of the water. It’s also just a short distance from Providence’s bustling city center, so it’s convenient for out-of-towners and locals alike.
  * **Their event venues are all gorgeous.** The large, dramatic Riverview Room boasts floor-to-ceiling windows facing the river, while the more intimate Loft, Library Lounge, and Boardroom areas feature inviting décor that’s earthy and romantic. In warmer months, outdoor affairs may be held on the bright, airy Patio overlooking the river.
  * **You’ll adore the menu.** Utilizing locally grown organic produce whenever possible, the team at Waterman has one eye on building community and the other on creative and delicious cuisine. The bistro-style menu highlights food inspired by Portuguese, French, New England, Italian, and Native American dishes, as well as an impressive boutique wine list.
