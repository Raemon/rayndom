Read More Show Less

  * **Acres of rolling green meadows,** a tranquil pond, hundreds of graceful moss-draped trees, charming vintage-inspired backdrops…that’s just the start of the pretty sights you’ll discover at this special venue, which is conveniently situated between San Antonio and Corpus Christi. 
  * **Both of their gorgeous venues—** Spanish Moss and Driftwood—boast indoor and outdoor facilities that work seamlessly together, and both include sweet dedicated outdoor chapels, ample seating, and stylish, purpose-built reception halls adorned with artfully curated, rustic-modern design details. 
  * **Rent the gracious Ranch House for the weekend** so you can make the most of this special property—with comfortable guest rooms, a pool, and access to all sorts of games and activities, it’s an ultra-fun way to round out an unforgettable weekend.
