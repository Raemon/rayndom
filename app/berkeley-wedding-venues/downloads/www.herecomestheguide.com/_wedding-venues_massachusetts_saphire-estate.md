## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked on the shores of scenic Lake Massapoag** and framed by lush woods, this lovely estate and manor house offers quintessential New England charm throughout its perfectly manicured grounds. Say your vows among brightly colored flowers, accompanied by the soothing sound of the patio's magnificent stone fountain trickling in the background.
  * **Toast with cocktails in the glam cocktail lounge,** where a roaring fireplace, quartz bar, and stunning millwork create a luxurious vibe,**** or retire to the courtyard, where tables and cozy seating areas allow guests to take in the natural splendor. Your reception is in the beautiful Ballroom, which is open, warm and inviting, with crisp white walls and trim, cushy couches, and a classic stone hearth.
  * **Celebrations are coordinated by Saphire Event Group** , a family-run business whose staff has tons of experience putting on extraordinary, personalized weddings, and their generous wedding packages include scrumptious food, a personal wedding coordinator, professional event manager, and a whole host of other goodies.
