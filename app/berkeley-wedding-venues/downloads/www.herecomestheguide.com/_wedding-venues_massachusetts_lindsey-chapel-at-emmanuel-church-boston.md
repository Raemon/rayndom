## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Modeled after the traditional “lady churches” of Europe,** this elegant Back Bay chapel has a poignant and romantic history: it was built as a memorial to Leslie Lindsey and Stewart Mason, newlyweds who were lost in the sinking of the Lusitania. 
  * **The English Gothic-inspired chapel** is intricate and stunning both indoors and out, with a 46-foot vaulted ceiling, ornate tiling, marble, woodwork, and dramatic stained glass windows depicting angels, biblical figures, and saints. 
  * **Generations of Bostonians have exchanged vows here,** and the church, which has a strong history of social justice and inclusion, welcomes couples of all faiths and orientations—its first same-sex wedding was held nearly 30 years ago.
