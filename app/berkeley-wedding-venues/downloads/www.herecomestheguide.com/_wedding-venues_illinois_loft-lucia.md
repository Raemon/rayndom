## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The private loft has a great West Loop location,** close to shopping, hotels, and tons of restaurants. Three city parks within walking distance give you some great additional photo opportunities, too. A friendly, top-notch events team stands at the ready to help you pull it all together. 
  * **The interior is a stylish blend of vintage warmth and industrial-chic vibes,** with exposed brick and ductwork and an open, stainless-steel kitchen area. Blonde wood floors and plenty of oversized windows ensure a welcoming, airy feel. 
  * **Large doors open to a cool landscaped outdoor terrace.** Boasting stunning views of the surrounding neighborhood, it presents a stellar option for cocktail hour, ceremony space, or rooftop lounge.
