## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s got a great Central Florida location** , just minutes from Orlando and all its world-famous attractions. Several hotels are within a short drive of the club, so your overnight guests will have no trouble finding lodging.
  * **You can exchange vows beneath the Ceremonial Garden’s white gazebo.** This pretty area overlooks the waterways and lush landscaping of the fairway, providing a backdrop for wonderful photos.
  * **Five event rooms are available for receptions of all sizes.** Larger functions are held in the classically-styled Grand Ballroom, or in the Main Dining Room, with its rustic beamed ceiling and tavern-style warmth. Three smaller spaces, each with its own gracious feel, are perfect for more intimate affairs.
