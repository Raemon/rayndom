## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **History, ecology, and luxury all blend seamlessly together this exquisite venue,** a multiple award-winning, meticulously restored Colonial Revival complex tucked away like a gorgeous surprise on 75,000 acres of sunny national parkland at the northern foot of the Golden Gate Bridge. With a luxurious on-site spa, restaurant & lounge, and plush contemporary guest rooms, this is a place to linger with your loved ones.
  * **The pristine, cream-colored Mission Blue Chapel,** named for an endangered California butterfly, stands high on a hillside covered with tufted grasses and California native plants. Its adjoining terrace and lawn create a lovely flow, each affording a vista of San Francisco, the sparkling bay, and the bridge rising above the pines and eucalyptus through tiaras of clouds.
  * **At the foot of the hill you'll find the Callippe Terrace,** outfitted with a welcoming fire pit, comfortable seating and a lovely view of historic Fort Baker. Team it up with the Callippe Ballroom and the Callippe Foyer for an ultra-grand indoor-outdoor fête. In the lodge itself, you'll find even more options: the balconied Verbena Room and Cavallo Point Cooking School kitchen are among our favorites.
