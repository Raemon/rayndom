## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A vintage-industrial gem hidden away in Baltimore’s arts-forward Highland neighborhood,** this newly premiered private space blends historic charm with enchanting design for a wholly unique wedding experience.
  * **Whitewashed walls, oversized windows, and skylights** set in the towering, exposed-ductwork ceiling ensure the room is filled with warm, natural light. It’s a handsome blank canvas to suit a host of styles, and the outdoor patio is the perfect spot for an al fresco cocktail bar. 
  * **They offer incredible, creative in-house floral design,** along with full planning services, furniture and equipment rentals. There’s also a catering kitchen, a beautiful dressing suite, and a cool private lounge area with hand-curated furnishings.
