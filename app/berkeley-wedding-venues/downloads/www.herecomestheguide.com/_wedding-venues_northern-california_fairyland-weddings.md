## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This whimsical Oakland landmark sits on the edge of Lake Merritt,** encompassing**** 10 acres of enchanting storybook sets, shady groves, and well-tended gardens. The beloved site has delighted people of all ages since the 1950s, and today retains its authentic vintage feel while boasting plenty of modern amenities to ensure a picture-perfect day.
  * **Leafy trees, quaint cottages, and colorful rides create a forest-meets-fairytale vibe.** You might exchange vows atop the verdant Jack-and-Jill Hill or inside the charming Chapel of Peace, then join your guests for a bit of fun on the Carousel or Jolly Roger Pirate Ship. We love al fresco receptions on the Merry Meadow, where the adjacent Emerald City Stage offers a fabulous backdrop for your DJ or head table.
  * **Your one-of-a-kind wedding will also be uniquely affordable,** since Fairyland is a nonprofit park dedicated to imagination and community. This also means your fees are tax-deductible and will go towards supporting this local treasure, ensuring it stays just as magical for years to come.
