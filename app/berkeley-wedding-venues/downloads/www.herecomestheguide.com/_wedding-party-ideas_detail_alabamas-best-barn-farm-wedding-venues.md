**You can't go wrong with a country wedding in a barn, on a farm, or both. What's not to love?** You'll usually find a combination of beautiful grounds and charming indoor spaces. And barns are a major attraction, be they weathered and historic or updated with all the modern amenities you could want. The following Alabama venues offer a variety of farm/barn settings, and many boast other assets like a home, gazebo, pond, river, or chapel. Whether you envision a place that's full-on rustic or one that leans more towards elegant, one of these is sure to fit you perfectly.
