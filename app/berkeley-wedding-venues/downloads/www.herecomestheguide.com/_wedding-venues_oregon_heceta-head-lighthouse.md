## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on a dramatic, rocky peak 250 feet above the waves,** this 1894 treasure is one of the most beautiful and most photographed lighthouses in the country. It still boasts its original First Order Fresnel Lens, whose guiding beams can be seen from more than 20 miles across the Pacific. 
  * **The grounds offer several romantic spots for ceremonies,** and you also have the option to arrange vows on the beach below, which is easily accessed by a path from the lighthouse. Warm weather receptions may be held on the lawn beneath a tent, and intimate/micro-weddings are welcome, too. 
  * **The Keeper’s Home is one of the last of its kind along the Oregon coast;** its six charming guest rooms can provide lodging for up to fifteen guests. Just a short stroll to the lighthouse, it boasts a communal kitchen, cozy parlors, and daily breakfasts that highlight the bounty of the Pacific Northwest.
