## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on ten lush acres in central Florida,** this historic private estate boasts bountiful tropical gardens and so many beautiful gathering spots, each with its own unique charm. (We’re big fans of the Club Car, a 1940s train car that can be used as a dressing suite!) 
  * **There’s a sweet white turn-of-the-century chapel,** complete with intricate stained glass windows, heart pine walls, and an antique bronze bell whose tolling announcing your wedding can be heard throughout the neighborhood. 
  * **Follow your vows with cocktails amid the gardens and koi ponds** surrounding the adorable little house known as “Snow White’s Cottage”, then dine and dance in the Tavern, the estate’s beautifully restored 1920s residence.
