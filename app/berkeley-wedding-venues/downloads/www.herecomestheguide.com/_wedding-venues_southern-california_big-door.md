## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This cool boutique event space, tucked near the beach** in the chic El Segundo neighborhood of Sleepy Hollow, is a fabulous blank canvas for your vision to take shape. Numerous venues, including a dressing suite & wood-walled lounge, a patio, and a fully-equipped stage, offer plenty of flexibility, while their simple packages make planning hassle-free.
  * **Let your celebration flow easily from indoors to outdoors.** From the large, bistro-lit patio, massive glass garage doors roll up to reveal the modern Great Room, which boasts aggregate polished cement floors, 18-foot ceilings with exposed beams, and a large bar area, and the Annex, a sleek foyer that leads to additional event spaces.
  * **Rental fees are affordable and easy to understand,** with great inclusions like a twirling-ready dance floor, party lights, a rad disco ball, a chalkboard wall, a flower wall perfect for selfies, and an incredibly wide window for your celebration—on weekends, you can select your time block for between 7am and 2am!
