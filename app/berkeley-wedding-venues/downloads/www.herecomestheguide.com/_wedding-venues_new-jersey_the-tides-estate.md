## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Classic elegance reigns at this top-of-the-line venue** with exceptional cuisine, white-glove service, and seven acres of manicured grounds that boast year-round photo ops. Spring blooms, fall colors, or the sparkle of lights on snowy branches create a magical backdrop for an outdoor ceremony.
  * **The estate's breathtaking main entrance has you at "hello".** From the gracious porte-cochère to the spectacular Main Lobby with its marble floors, dazzling chandeliers, and a dramatic, winding staircase, your guests will be wowed as they're welcomed warmly by a member of the estate's staff.
  * **The beautifully decorated banquet rooms and regally proportioned Ballroom** feature hardwood floors, soaring three-story high ceilings, crystal chandeliers, and tall windows throughout. For an intimate yet sophisticated affair, the Belmont and Manchester Rooms boast crystal "icicle" light fixtures, embellished columns, and timeless artwork.
