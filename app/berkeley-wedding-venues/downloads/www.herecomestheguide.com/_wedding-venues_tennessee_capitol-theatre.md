## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s a beautifully restored vintage theatre.** The Capitol has been a beloved part of downtown Maryville since 1934. Recent renovations incorporated state-of-the-art tech, tiered seating, and spiffed-up design elements, while ensuring that the building’s Art Deco roots remain prominent.
  * **Ceremonies may be held right on the original stage** , with a starlit curtain providing a dreamy backdrop. For even more Hollywood glamour, consider adding a drop-down chandelier, dramatic spotlighting, or even a fog machine!
  * **Nearly all wedding details can be arranged in-house** , from catering and centerpieces, to DJ and transportation services. There are also great extras that may be added to packages, like rental of the theatre’s luxe balcony and green room areas, an entrance decked out with a red carpet and velvet ropes, or your names up in lights on the building’s classic marquee.
