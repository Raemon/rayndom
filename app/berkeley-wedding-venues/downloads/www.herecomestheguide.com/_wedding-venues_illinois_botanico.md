## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This rooftop oasis exudes an intimate, exotic vibe.** Two event spaces create a lovely flow: start with a ceremony beneath a dramatic wall-to-wall skylight, surrounded by rich wood-paneled walls overflowing with lush greenery, then transition to the moody, vintage-inspired dining room, where Murano crystal wall lamps illuminate the sumptuous furnishings.
  * **Delectable dinners & craft cocktail menus are fully curated **to your tastes**** by the experts downstairs at Michelin-bibbed Mama Delia. Their fresh take on Spanish cuisine blends classic traditions with contemporary techniques, resulting in dynamic flavor combinations and exquisite presentation. Even the most discerning foodies will be thrilled! 
  * **The space is managed by Bonhomme Hospitality Group,** whose welcoming, innovative restaurants and event venues are among Chicago's most-loved (and most photogenic—don't miss the chance to snap gorgeous post-ceremony pics downstairs at the speakeasy-style lounge Bordel!). With their stellar staff's expertise and thoughtful guidance throughout your planning process, you're guaranteed a fun, stress-free day.
