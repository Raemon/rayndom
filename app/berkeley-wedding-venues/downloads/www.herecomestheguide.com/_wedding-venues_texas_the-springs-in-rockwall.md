## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Just outside Dallas, the elegant and rustic The Springs in Rockwall** is a sprawling event venue with both indoor and outdoor sites. Its picture-perfect grounds feature well-manicured lawns and a stone bridge spanning a bubbling brook.
  * **You can exchange vows in the spacious wood pavilion nestled among the trees** , before moving the party to the main hall with its gleaming oak floor and open-beam construction. A staircase descending from the dressing suite to the reception area is ideal for making a grand entrance.
  * **Seasoned professionals** will ensure things go off without a hitch. The Springs is part of a collection of world-class event centers in Texas and Oklahoma, and the experienced staff know just what it takes to keep things running smoothly.
