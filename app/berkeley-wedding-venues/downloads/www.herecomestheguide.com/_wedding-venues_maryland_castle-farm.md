## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Near Maryland’s desirable Eastern Shore** (and just a short drive from Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington D.C.), you’ll find this picture-perfect equestrian farm, nestled on over 150 lush acres. 
  * **There are multiple lovely ceremony locations,** including inside or outside the barn with gorgeous, solid mahogany barn doors as a backdrop, a wooded clearing, open pasture, and peaceful pond. Continue your celebration beneath a tent on the grounds or in the wonderful timber-framed barn.
  * **Opt for a package that includes full start-to-finish coordination,** or basic day-of assistance. And don’t forget to snap some pics with the beautiful resident Andalusian horses…they’re as friendly as they are stunning, and never say “no” to a photo op!
