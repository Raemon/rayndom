## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This tucked-away retreat on Mount Mansfield’s southern slope** is your private wedding hideaway, infused with natural beauty, authenticity, and a welcoming, laid-back vibe. You’ll find panoramic magic in every direction—from the sweeping forests and mountains to the weathered barn to the wildflower meadows dotted with Adirondack chairs.
  * **Dance the night away in the classic post-and-beam barn,** or opt for an al fresco gathering on the sprawling lawn, which is spacious enough for tenting. Whatever your style—low-key lobster boil, formal farm-to-table dinner, or late-night DJ-led dance party (there’s no curfew!)—the options are truly endless.
  * **There’s space to sleep 18 of your favorite people in the cozy Farmhouse,** which boasts two kitchens, a wraparound covered porch, and eight sweet bedrooms.**** Between events, there’s plenty to keep you entertained: Cool off in the brook-fed pool and warm up in the log cabin sauna, gather around the exterior fireplace, or host a family shuffleboard championship.
