## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This working distillery marries moody industrial style with deep historic roots,** housed in Illinois’ oldest standing brewery. Intimate events might be held in the Distiller’s Hall, which overlooks the production distillery (very cool for a peek at the process!) and is fully equipped with a dramatic limestone bar.
  * **Light floods through the original skylight in Cooper’s Hall,** a stunning space formerly used for barrel-making. Outfitted with an open-beamed barrel ceiling, polished concrete floors, exposed brick walls, and an adjacent patio allows the party to flow easily in and out, it’s got a warm, industrial feel and plenty of flexibility.
  * **Turn-key packages and expert planning services help the process** go down as smoothly as their in-house bourbon. Speaking of bourbon—you’ll certainly want to take advantage of their phenomenal bartenders, who will craft signature cocktails that showcase the spirits made just steps away.
