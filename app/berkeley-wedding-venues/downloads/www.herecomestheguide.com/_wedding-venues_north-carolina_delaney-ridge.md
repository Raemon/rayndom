## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked on over 90 acres of woodlands, meadows, burbling streams, and gardens** in the Blue Ridge Mountains, this secluded retreat boasts some of the most beautiful photo opportunities in the area (including frequent glimpses of local wildlife!) 
  * **The upscale, industrial-inspired reception space brings the outside in,** thanks to a wraparound patio, sparkling chandeliers, and glass garage-style doors that open onto the lush grounds. Two ceremony sites—an intimate poolside pergola and a dramatic stone terrace—are just steps away.
  * **Straightforward, customizable packages simplify the planning process** and include lots of fabulous amenities, like two great dressing spaces, lawn games, transportation to the ceremony sites, and a stocked fire pit, and the opportunity to add-on what you need (think planning & coordination, rehearsal dinner access, or place settings) and leave off what you don't.
