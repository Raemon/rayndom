## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This swank boutique hotel's vibe is an effortless blend** of stylish comfort and urban chic—it feels like you're stepping into the home of your hippest city-dwelling friend. 
  * **There are so many cool spaces for a celebration.** The Exchange Ballroom wows guests with its sleek design and onyx skylights, but there's also a rooftop oasis (with a pool and plenty of space for lounging with a cocktail) and an all-seasons outdoor patio that's part backyard, part urban playground.
  * **Your menu will be developed by the hotel's innovative restaurant** , _Dovetail,_ which specializes in creative, seasonal dishes that are shareable and approachable. And don't forget the libations! Viceroy Washington D.C.'s master cocktail craftswoman uses ingredients from her own garden to design delightful drinks you won't find anywhere else.
