## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With a history dating back over 150 years,** this mill, with its towering silos, is an iconic centerpiece of downtown McKinney. It’s been beautifully restored, retaining its antique charm while adding all the essential modern amenities—including two posh dressing suites. 
  * **Interiors boast cool, industrial-chic vibes** with vintage touches like exposed brick, weathered wood, and salvaged equipment that has been whimsically repurposed…we’re super in love with the elevator-turned-bar, and the grain shoot chandeliers. 
  * **Ashlee’s Garden is the mill's fab outdoor space.** Featuring a faux lawn, a stage, bistro lighting, and lush surrounding greenery, it’s an awesome spot for your al fresco celebration, cocktail lounge, or sunset ceremony.
