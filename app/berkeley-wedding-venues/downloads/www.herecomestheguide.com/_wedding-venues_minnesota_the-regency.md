## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **In the photo-friendly heart of St. Cloud’s historic downtown,** you’ll find this artfully renovated space that features original vintage character and sophisticated, modern updates. Have traveling guests? There are three hotels within just a few blocks. 
  * **Exposed brick, stylish pops of weathered wood, and ample natural light** streaming in through oversized windows lend glamorous touches to the main room, whose 8,000 square-foot layout ensures you’ve got plenty of space to play with. Separate outdoor and bar areas further enhance the party flow. 
  * **The help of an experienced day-of coordinator is included in your rental,** and you have access to the venue starting at 7am the morning of your event. In-house décor—ceiling drapes, bistro lights, a greenery wall, and more—can affordably be added to your package.
