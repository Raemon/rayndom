  * **The hotel’s own private beach is a beautiful location for an intimate oceanside ceremony.** If you have a larger group, you can still have a wedding by the water on the expansive terrace.
  * **Panoramic views of the Atlantic through floor-to-ceiling windows** , along with sophisticated contemporary décor, make the oceanfront ballroom an exceptional space for a stylish reception.
  * **They take pride in helping you bring your cultural traditions to life** , with personalized, attentive service and menus that can be customized to fit the needs of your group.
