## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Sitting on a beautiful spot on the Cumberland Plateau,** this ranch-style venue offers tons of space for both indoor and outdoor events. We especially love the wide-open reception hall and the cute meadow ceremony space, with its barn-door entry and rustic wooden benches. 
  * **You'll find lots of fun additions around the property,** like well-appointed dressing suites for the guys and gals, and a huge fire pit encircled by double-wide wooden swings. 
  * **They offer a well-priced, year-round rate that includes two full days of rental time—** and they're also available for showers, rehearsal dinners, reunions, and corporate events.
