## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Surrounded by over 200 acres of natural Sussex County woodland,** this special spot boasts an enchanted forest feel, with fun, rustic gathering spaces set amid shady trails, a pond, streams, and a tranquil lake. There are plenty of beds in the camp’s ten cabins, and ample hotel options nearby for guests who wish to book traditional accommodations. 
  * **Vows can be exchanged in the Ceremony Field,** and followed by lawn games and a tented reception. Or, take advantage of the charming medieval-themed bar room and the large Renaissance Tavern Hall for an indoor celebration. No need to rush home…there are no local noise ordinances in effect here, so you can keep the festivities going into the wee hours.
  * **The magical woodland setting** lends itself especially well to weddings with an enchanted/fairytale vibe, and they even have the backdrops and activities to enhance the effect, including a castle façade, jousting, archery, and axe-throwing areas, and medieval boat on the lake.
