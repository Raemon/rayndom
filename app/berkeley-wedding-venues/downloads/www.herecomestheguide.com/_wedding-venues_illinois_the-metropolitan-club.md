## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Say "I do" with a view at this stylish sky-high venue** on the 66th and 67th floors of the Willis Tower. Offering an alluring combination of elevated, versatile event spaces, world-class cuisine, and some of the very best views in Chicago, celebrations here will leave you on Cloud Nine.
  * **Panoramic windows line the walls of the expansive Oak Ballroom,** aptly named for the warm wood beams that adorn the elegant coffered ceilings. The more intimate East Room is equally impressive, boasting unparalleled vistas of Grant Park, Museum Campus, Millennium Park, and Lake Michigan.
  * **Passionate, personalized service is the hallmark of weddings here.** Always-included amenities like upgraded Lamour linens and gold Chiavari chairs are joined by the expert guidance of the events team and the fresh, seasonal menus crafted for you by the talented culinary staff.
