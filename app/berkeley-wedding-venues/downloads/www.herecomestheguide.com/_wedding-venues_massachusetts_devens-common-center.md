## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This event facility is a bit classic and a bit modern** , with multiple light-filled function spaces that are bright and airy thanks to oversized windows and a stylish, neutral color palette.
  * **Exchange vows in the peaceful Bridal Garden** , then celebrate in the traditional elegance of the Grande Ballroom. For something fun and different, consider an intimate reception in the Piano Lounge, with its impressive staircase, bamboo flooring, and gleaming grand piano.
  * **Guests have a convenient and comfortable lodging option** in Springhill Suites, which is connected to the Center. It's an all-suite hotel with an indoor pool, whirlpool spa, fitness center, and complimentary breakfast buffet.
