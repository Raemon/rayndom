## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A former dairy farm, Fern Hill Barn is a private country escape blessed with idyllic scenery and a ton of sweet surprises** \-- a brick and glass greenhouse; a quaint pond; two homey get-ready suites with on-site hair and makeup services; and the namesake ferns creating a lush carpet of green beneath the mature trees (also a divine photo opp). 
  * **Your wedding aisle is a stone walkway that crosses a feathery lawn to a wood gazebo, with forests and hills providing a painterly backdrop.** For dining and dancing, a spacious, open-sided white pavilion aglow with fairy lights and a whimsical black-and-white checkered dance floor offers a festive ambiance. Then there’s the Grand Barn itself, which gives off rustic country vibes, thanks to exposed beams and whitewashed walls, original pine flooring, a built-in oak bar and a double-sided fieldstone fireplace.
  * **Convenient build-your-own wedding packages, top local vendors and a caring wedding team will ease your planning stress.** Located less than 60 miles from Boston, Fern Hill Barn is also accessible from surrounding cities like Springfield, Hartford and Providence...Welcome to that hidden wedding treasure you’ve been dreaming of!
