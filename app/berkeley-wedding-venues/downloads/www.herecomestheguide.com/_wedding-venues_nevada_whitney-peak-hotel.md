  * **This independent luxury hotel in the heart of downtown Reno** is a sure bet for a stylish, seamless wedding. A great midtown location near Truckee River Walk, artfully designed event spaces, and beautiful Sierra Mountain views from the warm, pet-friendly guest rooms are just some of the highlights.

  * **Whitney Peak Ballroom takes industrial chic and glams it up** with gorgeous chandeliers, polished wood, pop art, two balconies, and a theater and lounge. Plus, expert chefs will craft a fine dining menu just for you, with a full-service in-house bar and all your standard rentals included.
  * **So much to do, so many photos to take!** Use the rooftop panoramas, weathered brick walls, and iconic Reno Arch as cool backdrops. For more fun, take advantage of your complimentary access to BaseCamp, the hotel’s 7,000 square foot climbing gym, and hit up a nearby casino.
