## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on 225 acres overlooking the North Georgia mountains,** this pretty spot has been occupied by the same family for over 100 years. Exotic Sika and Fallow deer roam the farm’s gentle pastures, along with some very photogenic alpacas, donkeys, emus, horses, and swans who call the farm home.
  * **Choose between several ceremony locations around the lush grounds—** every option is prettier than the last—then celebrate in the bright, airy event room. With design touches that blend industrial and rustic elements, it sits at the lake’s edge, and boasts a vaulted wood-beamed ceiling, sparkling chandeliers, concrete flooring, and a large patio.
  * **The impressive stone Estate House** can provide luxury housing for up to 40 guests across its ten bedrooms. Outfitted with a gourmet kitchen, library, theater room, and plenty of entertainment (foosball, ping-pong, darts, a poker table, and more), it’s a fantastic space for both your day-of preparations and for extending your weekend fun.
