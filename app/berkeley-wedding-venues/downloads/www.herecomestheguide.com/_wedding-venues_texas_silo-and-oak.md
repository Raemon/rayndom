## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's an intimate, family-run venue** with so many wonderful, photo-ready details, including romantic wood porches, a swing hung from a sprawling oak, a cute old truck, and its namesake towering clay-block silo.
  * **You have a choice of beautiful ceremony options:** in the quiet of the woods, at the base of the silo (dressed up for the occasion with chandeliers in its exposed tiers), or in the lovely indoor space, where oversized windows bring the outdoors inside.
  * **Celebrate in the wonderful reception hall** , which features rows of large windows, corrugated tin detailing, and the "Watering Hole", your fun, dedicated bar area.
