## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A historic horse farm that dates back to the mid-1700s,** this rural escape impresses at every turn, with picturesque features like a tree-lined drive, a vintage stone smokehouse, ancient trees, and a manicured English Garden. 
  * **Welcome guests to a meadow clearing for your romantic outdoor ceremony.** Lawn games and photos with the graceful resident horses are encouraged during an al fresco cocktail hour, and then it’s time to retreat to the antique barn for an reception beneath twinkle-lit open rafters. 
  * **The Chandelier Farmhouse is the estate’s charming B &B.** Sleeping up to fourteen guests, it boasts spacious gathering areas, a wraparound porch, and a cozy fire pit. Private chef services can be arranged for those seeking a special culinary treat.
