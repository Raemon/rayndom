## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With a history going back over 100 years,** this special resort exemplifies the quintessential New England inn, with its quaint, “down east” architecture and span of rugged shoreline along bustling Boothbay Harbor. 
  * **The Oceanfront Deck hosts ceremonies overlooking the Atlantic,** but can also be used for your cocktail hour or a rehearsal dinner lobster bake. Pemaquid Hall, the resort’s light-filled reception space, has elegant coastal vibes, and was built using reclaimed pine from the property’s original inn. 
  * **Cottages, lodges, townhomes, and traditional rooms in the historic inn—** there’s truly a home for everyone here, and each space is decked out with vintage coastal character. There’s plenty offered to keep guests entertained, including tennis courts, kayaking, paddleboarding, and a world-class spa.
