## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The largest of its kind in the southeast,** this fantastic museum features sleek, stylish event spaces with a host of unique exhibits and backdrops. Relish in awesome views of downtown Raleigh as you explore unique collections of some of the South’s greatest natural treasures.
  * **Your space options are incredibly cool.** A few of our favorite choices: Mountains to  
the Sea, with its 20-foot waterfall cascading down a mountainside, a coastal environment canopied by massive whale skeletons and featuring live seahorses and a sandy beach, and a spacious third-floor hall with a glass-domed ceiling and 110-million year-old Acrocanthosaurus dinosaur specimen.
  * **For something extra special, a****dd the Dueling Dinosaurs VIP Experience,** which will thrill your guests with one of the best-preserved and most complete fossils of a tyrannosaur and a Triceratops on earth. Additional helpful amenities include top-notch A/V capabilities, security services, and fun educational programming... and best yet, your fee helps support the museum and includes a complimentary one-year membership!
