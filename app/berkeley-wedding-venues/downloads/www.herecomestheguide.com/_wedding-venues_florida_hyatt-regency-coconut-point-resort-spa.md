## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's a tropical waterfront retreat:** This luxurious hotel and spa on 26 landscaped acres just north of Naples overlooks Estero Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. You and your guests can even take a 20-minute boat ride out to North Point, a private island, for an intimate ceremony.
  * **The stunning and spacious reception sites** include the lakeside Cypress Courtyard with adjacent Waterfall Pool Deck, the palm-lined Belvedere Terrace, and the impressive Calusa Ballroom, which can accommodate even the largest celebrations in elegant style.
  * **Be pampered at the Stillwater Spa** , which features innovative and eco-sensitive treatments such as aromatouch and reflexology massage. You can also relax and indulge with a round of golf or an afternoon in the adults-only lazy river complex.
