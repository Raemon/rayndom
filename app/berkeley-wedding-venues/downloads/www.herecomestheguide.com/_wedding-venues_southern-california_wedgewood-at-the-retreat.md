## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

A feast for the eyes at every turn, The Retreat by Wedgewood Weddings is a true beauty inside and out. From its enviable hilltop location within a gated community and semiprivate country club, this sophisticated Inland Empire wedding venue does indeed provide a quiet retreat with sweeping views, cooling breezes, and a sprawling Tuscan-inspired clubhouse. 

The estate-like grounds welcome guests into a fountain courtyard adorned with roses and fluttery palm trees. Double doors open to the clubhouse's impressive entry, a high-ceilinged "great room" with a stone fireplace and inviting leather couches—a great spot for guests to mingle before your evening event.

Vows are exchanged on the manicured ceremony lawn out back, where friends and family enjoy an unobstructed view of the Temescal Valley...and of you, making a dramatic grand entrance down an 80-foot wedding aisle. Time it just right and you'll get to tie the knot just as the setting sun casts a romantic pink glow on the surrounding mountains.

Cocktail hours, al fresco receptions, and even dancing can all take place on the neighboring stone terrace. Overlooking a garden landscape and the tree-studded hills beyond, the terrace also boasts slender palms, an outdoor fireplace, and bistro lighting for added glamour. Or take the party inside to the vaulted banquet room, complete with dance floor, a large stone fireplace, and an adjoining private lounge with a handsome marble bar—perfect for capping off the evening with a final toast.

One key to your celebration's success is the experienced Wedgewood Weddings staff, who'll customize their all-inclusive wedding packages to your exact specifications. Their convenient, value-packed services make for a day that's not only memorable, but virtually effortless as well.
