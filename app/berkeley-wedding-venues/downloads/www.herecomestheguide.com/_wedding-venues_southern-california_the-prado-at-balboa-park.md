## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This 1915 Spanish Colonial gem in the heart of Balboa Park** is a San Diego landmark**.** Multiple gorgeous indoor and outdoor event spaces exude an elegant, Old World charm, adorned with sculpted archways, colorful tiles, and large French doors that open onto garden courtyards framed by bougainvillea and tiled fountains.
  * **Multi-level terraces tucked among the lush foliage of the Casa del Rey Moro Garden** —a favorite site for exchanging vows—are bursting with elegant details, like historic fountains, reflecting pools,and a wishing well. Toast with cocktails in the Spanish-inspired Fountain Courtyard before stepping into the Grand Ballroom to dine & dance beneath the soaring, 27-foot hand-stenciled ceilings.
  * **Your wedding cuisine is provided by the award-winning experts at Cohn Restaurant Group,** who offer innovative, custom-designed menus, top-shelf bar service with their signature sangria, and staff-synchronized service for a truly luxurious experience.
