## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You've hit the jackpot with this dazzling historic gem,** tucked away in the heart of downtown L.A. Combining original details like intricate moldings and tall arched windows with a refreshing blank canvas setup, it's the perfect backdrop for stylish couples who want to tie the knot in an unbeatable location.
  * **The ballroom is truly wow-worthy, with a vaulted skylight** that casts natural light over the poured concrete floors and marble bar and shimmers off the three massive crystal chandeliers suspended above. A crisp white color scheme invites creativity, with built-in lighting and sound systems that can transform the space.
  * **You can BYO just about everything thanks to flexible vendor policies** and wallet-friendly pricing. Generous inclusions like a plush lounge set and greenery wall, adjacent parking, and an extended rental time gives you the freedom to craft your own flow... and the ability to party until 1AM.
