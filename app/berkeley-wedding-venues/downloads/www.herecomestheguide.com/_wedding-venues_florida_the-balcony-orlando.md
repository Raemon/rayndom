## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched eleven stories above the streets of downtown Orlando,** this ultra-modern private event venue boasts indoor and outdoor spaces that treat guests to unforgettable views of the city skyline and Lake Enola.
  * **The airy terrace boasts over 10,000 square feet of flexible space,** and is illuminated by romantic string lighting overhead, allowing you to host all phases of your celebration—ceremony, cocktails, and reception—entirely outside, if you wish.
  * **A loft-style ballroom offers you an indoor alternative** (or additional) party setting. Features include floor-to-ceiling wraparound windows, a high ceiling with exposed rafters and ductwork, a maplewood dance floor, dimmable lighting, and even a private lounge suite.
