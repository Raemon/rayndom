## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Bring your own Hollywood love story to life at this enchanting 10-acre estate,** which has transformed from a beloved family home to play host movie shoots, joyous parties, and hundreds of weddings (including the owners' own!). Though just 20 minutes from downtown L.A., it's a truly private oasis hidden behind a gate in a picturesque box canyon.
  * **Spanning 16 terraced levels, there are endless backdrops for romantic celebrations.** Exchange vows in a citrus orchard tucked against the hillside, or descend a dramatic Spanish-inspired staircase to an intimate patio nestled alongside the red tile-roofed Hacienda.
  * **Cocktails can be enjoyed poolside or on one of the palm-lined lawns,** with easy access to the adjacent horseshoe pits and swings. Receptions are often held on a spacious stone patio studded with shade trees—as night falls, bistro lights in their branches illuminate with a magical glow, adding another touch of romance to the occasion.
