## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A guaranteed jaw-dropper, this 1929 Italianate mansion** makes an indelible first impression. The huge fountain, classic statues, Juliet balconies, and verdant grounds will beckon your guests and thrill your photographer.
  * **Want to float down a grand staircase?** They have several, each one unique. There's a circular one, a zigzag one, and a wide stone stairway leading to a tiered, landscaped lawn where you can exchange vows in a Gatsby-esque setting.
  * **The interior is a visual feast of dazzling design.** A rotunda with a gilded inlaid ceiling, a Great Room with sandcast walls and a solarium roof, curvy deco rooms, tiled verandas, and sweeping views are just some highlights you'll find here.
