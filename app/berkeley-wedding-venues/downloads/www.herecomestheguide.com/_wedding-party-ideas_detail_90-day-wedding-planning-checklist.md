## 10–12 Weeks To Go…

When you're on such a short timeline, most of the heavy lifting will need to be done upfront. But hey, just think: In 3 short months you'll be living the married life with your best friend. *throws confetti*

  * [ **Establish a budget**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/6-simple-steps-to-setting-a-wedding-budget)**and stick to it.** When you don't have much time, you need to figure out what your bottom line is—fast!  

  * [**Put together your guest list**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-party-ideas/detail/tips-wedding-guest-list)**with that budget in mind.** Just remember that with this tight timeframe many of your guests may already have plans, so don't stress about adding a few extra invitees.  

  * [**Find your wedding style.**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-find-your-wedding-style)Picking a theme early on, or at least a color palette, can really help you nail down all of the other details. Choose a style you vibe with and let the rest fall into place.  

  * [**Find a venue**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues)**for your ceremony and reception,** **and set your date!**[Know what questions to ask](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/questions-to-ask-your-wedding-venue) when evaluating a wedding venue.
    * _**TIP**_ : Be reasonable. A lot of venues and vendors book several months to YEARS in advance. Your dream venue may not be available, so be open to looking at places you might not have originally considered.  

  * [**Sign up for MyGuide.**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/myguide) We'll send you seriously useful—and sassy!—wedding-planning emails with tons of practical advice.  

  * Send out Save The Dates, like NOW! Ditch snail mail save-the-dates for super-easy emails or a pretty and informative [wedding website](https://www.minted.com/wedding-websites?utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_source=shareasale&utm_sub=272042&utm_campaign=hctgfeature&utm_content=90dayweddingplanningchecklist).  

  * **Find your wedding attire.**  

    * Head to a trunk show, sample sale, or even a larger box store like Nordstrom's or Anthropologie Weddings. Or heck, just buy a LWD off the rack!  

    * If you prefer pants, it's a little easier to get a wedding ensemble at the last minute. A quick-and-easy suit or tux rental is the way to go.  

    * Plan for about 8 weeks of alteration time (so you should hit up a local seamstress/tailor right away, if necessary.)  

  * **Are you having a wedding party?** If so, let them know and decide on their day-of attire ASAP. Having a group is great, but forgoing bridesmaids or groomsmen could really simplify plans...  

  * [**Hire a Wedding Planner**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/the-difference-between-venue-coordinators-and-wedding-planners)**if things get too overwhelming.** They're experts at making wedding miracles happen when the clock is ticking. Plus, they can hook you up with their preferred vendor list. #twobirdsonestone

## 8–10 Weeks To Go…

[ ](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/new-york/terrace-on-the-park)

[Terrace on the Park](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/new-york/terrace-on-the-park "Terrace on the Park") | [Rebecca Ou Photography](https://rebeccaouphotography.com/ "Rebecca Ou Photography")

As overwhelming as planning your wedding in 90 days may seem, the best approach is to focus on the big-ticket items, and cut out most of the "extras". (No, you really don't need that chocolate fondue tower.)

  * **Decide what you can reasonably do yourself—and where you can enlist the help of others.** Maybe you're fine with hitting up Trader Joe's to DIY a bridal bouquet, but you know for a fact that a hand-lettered sign is not in your wheelhouse. Think carefully about what's worth your blood, sweat, and tears, then forget the rest. (We're kidding about the blood part. Mostly.)  

  * [**Find your vendors.**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/the-ultimate-guide-to-choosing-your-wedding-vendors)Again, stay flexible because some may be unavailable with such short notice. Here are a few of the must-haves:
    * Caterer
    * Photographer / Videographer
    * Officiant
    * Oh, and when you hire a vendor, [get all the details in writing!](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-party-ideas/detail/protect-your-wedding-get-it-in-writing)  

  * **Get your**[**beauty and fitness regimen**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-beauty-timeline)**in gear.** A workout routine could be a major stress-reliever during this time. (Or just keep wine handy, we won't judge.)  

  * **Order your wedding invites.** You'll want to give friends and family as much notice as possible to make travel arrangements.
    * _**TIP**_ : Check out these [all-in-one wedding invitations](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/affordable-wedding-invitations) to save on time and that precious cash money. Yes, puh-lease!  

  * **Arrange and book any necessary day-of transportation.**  

  * **Arrange hotel room blocks for out-of-town guests** and book your own suite for the wedding night.  

  * **Start thinking about your honeymoon,** if you're into that.
    * _**Remember**_ : There's no rule that says you NEED to go on a honeymoon right after your wedding. Plan a "mini-moon" for the weekend at a cute bed & breakfast and save the big trip for a few months to a year down the road. Waaay more practical.



* * *

## 6–8 Weeks To Go…

[ ](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/new-york/blooming-hill-farm)

[Blooming Hill Farm](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/new-york/blooming-hill-farm "Blooming Hill Farm") | [Autumn Jordan](https://www.autumn-jordan.com/ "Autumn Jordan")

You're 6 weeks out! Now's the time to make sure you have all necessary vendors locked and loaded. Your wedding invitations should go out soon, and you basically want all "big ticket" items in order.

  * **Finalize vendors and other day-of helpers.** This may include:
    * DJ or Musicians
    * Florist
    * Cake Maker
    *  _**TIP**_ : If necessary, your makeup artist could be your über-talented cousin, your cake could come from Costco, and your wedding day 'do' could be a gorgeous [Up-Tini from DryBar](https://www.drybarshops.com/the-styles/)—and that's a-okay! Rest assured, your day will be fab.  

  * **Register and update your wedding website** so your guests can get to shopping. Make things easy on yourself by using an online registry that allows you and your fiancé to skip the store and add items from any website.  

  * **Book the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner location,** or tap a grandparent with a really big backyard. (Hellloooo, Luau BBQ!) But remember, if you're planning a small wedding or one without the traditional pomp and circumstance, you may not even need a rehearsal dinner! Just be sure everyone involved is on the same page when the Big Day arrives.  

  * **Reserve all necessary party rentals and linens,** including an inclement weather backup, like a tent.  

  * **Get those invites in the mail!** PHEW.



* * *

## 4–5 Weeks To Go…

[ ](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/connecticut/saybrook-point-resort-marina)

[Saybrook Point Resort & Marina](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/connecticut/saybrook-point-resort-marina "Saybrook Point Resort & Marina") | [HK Photography](https://hkphotography.com/ "HK Photography")

Woo hoo! By now, you basically have all the essentials lined up. Now you can begin working on the fun stuff. Do you want to purchase bridal party gifts? Something old, new, borrowed, and blue? Pretty ceremony programs? Fit those to-do tasks in here, along with the following:

  * **Check your state's requirements and make plans to obtain your marriage license.** Some states have waiting periods as short as 0–24 hours, while others can take as long as six days (like Wisconsin!).  

  * **Purchase wedding rings, if you haven't already.** They don't have to be expensive, either.  

  * **Order**[**wedding favors**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-party-ideas/detail/10-wedding-favors-under-1-dollar)**for your guests.** If you're going the DIY route, keep them simple so you're not pulling your hair out trying to finish them in time.  

  * **If you have a wedding party, give them a nudge** —make sure they've ordered all necessary attire. You can also purchase wedding party gifts, if you’d like.  

  * **Start researching name-change requirements.** If that's your thing, of course.



* * *

## 2–3 Weeks To Go…

[ ](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/texas/cactus-moon-lodge)

[Cactus Moon Lodge](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/texas/cactus-moon-lodge "Cactus Moon Lodge") | [Angela King Photography](https://angelakingphotography.com/ "Angela King Photography")

It's getting real...

  * **Finalize and confirm:**
    * Wedding vows and readings with your officiant.
    * Menu with your caterer.
    * Shot list with your photographer/videographer.
    * Song list for ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception with your DJ and/or band/musicians—or whoever is running your playlist!
    * Who's giving the toasts.
    * Wedding night and/or honeymoon accommodations.  

  * **Create your**[**wedding-day timeline.**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-create-your-wedding-timeline)**** Your guests, your fiancé, and even your vendors are going to need a game plan as to how you're getting from morning mimosas to the DJ's last call.  

  * **Hunt down whoever hasn't RSVP'd yet.** Sigh.



* * *

## 1 Week To Go…

[ ](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/colorado/spruce-mountain-ranch)

[Spruce Mountain Events](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/colorado/spruce-mountain-ranch "Spruce Mountain Events")

The theme of this week? Finalize!!

  * **Give your caterer/venue the final guest count** and day-of timeline.  

  * **Arrange seating and create the seating chart** and/or place cards, if necessary.  

  * **Pick up your gown or suit if you don't already have it.** _Swoon_.  

  * **Confirm arrival times and finalize the wedding timeline** with vendors and the wedding party.  

  * **Put together your own**[**Wedding Emergency Kit**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-day-emergency-fashion-kit)**.** You can never be too prepared!  

  * **Pack for the wedding night and your honeymoon/mini-moon,** if you're going on one!

## Last Minute Essentials…

[Cator Woolford Gardens](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/georgia/cator-woolford-gardens "Cator Woolford Gardens") | [Ashley White Photos](https://ashleywhitephotos.com/ "Ashley White Photos")

It's crunch time, yo!

  * [**Figure out tips**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/tip-wedding-vendors)**and final payments for vendors.** Put them in clearly marked envelopes and give them to the Best Man or another person you trust to hand out at the reception.
    * _**TIP**_ : Though not necessary, consider gifting small but thoughtful things—like a bottle of Prosecco or a gift card for a mani-pedi—to any friends that acted as your wedding party, glam squad, playlist DJ, etc. #youdabest  

  * **Assign someone to pack up your gifts/belongings after the reception** (including the top tier of your cake!).  

  * **Thank your BFF for agreeing to return the groom's tux** and other rental items the day after the wedding.  

  * **Make sure all wedding-day items are packed/laid out** and ready to go the night before your big day. Don't forget the rings and marriage license!  

  * **Take deep breaths.** Stop to appreciate your soon-to-be husband or wife because the day you've been waiting for is finally here.

Congrats you newlywed, you.

  * **Write and send**[**thank-you cards**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-thank-you-note-etiquette)—don't procrastinate!  

  * **Complete your registry** and exchange any unwanted or duplicate gifts.  

  * **Have your wedding dress cleaned** and preserved by a reputable company.  

  * **Keep in touch with your photographer/videographer** to work on albums, DVDs, etc.  

  * **Enjoy wedded bliss...**
