## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Adventure awaits at this beloved resort,** nestled on 1,500 wooded acres beside New River Gorge National Park. Your wedding weekend here is alive with possibilities: get your heart pumping with a whitewater rafting trip or ziplining through the trees or gather with your loved ones over local craft brews and live music.
  * **Perched right above the grand New River Gorge** where the river curves into a dramatic horseshoe, the Concho Wedding Deck offers some of the best views in the region. It's the ideal setting for al fresco ceremonies and receptions, with lush forest on either side creating a secluded feel. There's even a convenient shuttle, which can whisk your guests to and from the site.
  * **The package options are varied, inclusive... and won't break the bank**. Pricing starts with a base rate for the venue, giving you the freedom to add-on exactly the items you need—like catering, shuttle services, lodging, etc.—and none you don't. Whether you're DIY-obsessed or prefer a more all-inclusive option, this flexibility ensures a perfect, affordable fit.
