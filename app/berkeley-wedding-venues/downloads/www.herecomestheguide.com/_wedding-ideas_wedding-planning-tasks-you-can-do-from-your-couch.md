# 7 Wedding Planning Tasks You Can Conquer From The Comfort Of Your Couch

## Let the cozy wedding planning begin!

**Whether you're planning a wedding from next door to your venue or across the country,** there's plenty of work you can do while curled up on the couch. Here are 7 wedding planning tasks you can cross off your list without ever leaving home.

## Put together your wedding website.

**A wedding website is the perfect way to keep guests up-to-date on all the developments and details of your big day.** And the best part? A quick Google search comes up with a variety of really beautiful, free templates for you to take advantage of!

## Find the venue of your dreams.

**Throw on your soft pants, grab your laptop, and scope out the comprehensive lists of**[**wedding venues**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues)**right here on Here Comes The Guide!** Find venues by area, budget, guest count, or style—from rustic barns to non-traditional industrial spaces and even woodsy retreats. And if you need to downsize your wedding, we have an entire section of our site dedicated to event spaces that cater to [small weddings of 50 or less.](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/small-wedding) See prices, get deals, and view lots of big, gorgeous photos + wedding videos that basically offer a [virtual tour of the event space](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-choose-a-wedding-venue-without-seeing-it-in-person). Then, book a site visit right there from your couch.

## Sign up for MyGuide.

**MyGuide is what we call our wedding planning e-newsletter, and our beloved subscribers.** We'll send you seriously useful—and sassy!—wedding-planning emails with tons of practical advice. We write these emails ourselves (meaning no dry marketing copy or boring templates) and treat our subscribers as our BFFs. We only give advice that's in your best interest, and only recommend things we truly believe in.

## Order suits and tuxes.

**Rent the highest quality tuxedos and suits online without ever visiting a store!**[Generation Tux](https://generationtux.com/) has modernized the formalwear shopping experience with their groundbreaking website. Shop over 20 on-trend suit and tuxedo styles, along with thousands of colorful accessories to match your wedding color scheme. (They'll even send you complimentary fabric swatches to ensure the perfect match!) And with their eTailor algorithm, they can also ensure the perfect fit—without those awkward measuring tape moments.

## Give your wedding party fashion freedom!

**Take advantage of the mix-and-match dress trend by giving your wedding party the color palette/event style you've chosen, along with the freedom to pick their own ensemble.** Your party will appreciate your flexibility—and you'll save loads of time on group shopping trips. They can choose something fabulous from their closets, find designer duds on [Rent The Runway](https://www.renttherunway.com/), or purchase something they'll no doubt wear again.

## Register for gifts or experiences.

**While nothing's more fun than using that little scanner gun, couples at home should take advantage of the wide array of online registry options available.** From honeymoon registries to websites that let you add gifts from any store, cross this task off your list by cozying up on the couch and shopping entirely online.

## Donate to charity in lieu of favors.

**Let's be real: most of your guests won't be sad if they don't receive a tea light candle or glassine bag full of Hershey's kisses.** Instead of spending the time putting together favors, why not donate the money to your favorite charity instead? Then, put up a pretty sign at the reception letting your guests know how they were a part of it. You'll not only save time, but you'll also give back—and we call that a win-win.
