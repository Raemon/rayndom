## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The Lakeside Garden ceremony site is absolutely dreamy** with bountiful flowers, a quaint water mill trickling into a sparkling lake, a private dock, and graceful resident swans. Want a bit more drama? Check out the fountain at the lake’s center with its color-changing LED lights!
  * **A glass of chilled champagne welcomes guests to cocktail hour** in the Grand Lobby, where they can watch chefs prepare hors d’oeuvres in the open kitchen. In the Grand Ballroom, you’ll make your entrance from a romantic Juliet balcony...as you begin your first dance as a married couple, and enjoy the beautiful sunset views of over the lake from our stunning wraparound windows.
  * **Your stellar in-house culinary team** takes all the guesswork out of planning the food, cocktails, and desserts. The experienced executive chef, who oversees weddings at all three distinctive Beau Truesdale Wedding Venues, delights in customizing menus for each couple.
