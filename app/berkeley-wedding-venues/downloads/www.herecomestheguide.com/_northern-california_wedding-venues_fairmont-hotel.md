## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

As the first hotel to open after the 1906 earthquake, Fairmont San Francisco became the main gathering place and grand centerpiece of the City by the Bay. Since then, this extraordinary hotel continues to be a mecca for guests from all over the world and one of San Francisco’s most treasured landmarks.

Over the last century, Fairmont San Francisco has undergone many changes, but its place as the go-to venue for celebrations and milestone occasions has remained constant. Renowned architect Julia Morgan’s stunning turn-of-the-century interior is complemented by all of the modern amenities you’d expect in a world-class hotel— the result is a distinctive classic-meets-contemporary feel unlike anywhere else.

The lobby is splendidly understated, with ornate rich plum and gold hues and a gilded 26-foot high ceiling. Multiple pilasters and columns, painted in a trompe l’oeil marble finish, are highlighted with gold leaf accents. Informal clusters of period-style furniture, rich in detail with lots of tassels and trim, dot the lobby. The adjacent Laurel Court has become a warm and elegant restaurant and bar where your guests will enjoy mingling over drinks and hors d’oeuvres.

Two of the most grand and glamorous spaces in the hotel are the Venetian Room and Gold Room. Both are light and expansive, with elaborately ornamented vaulted ceilings, gold leaf detailing, and crystal chandeliers. The Pavilion Room has picture windows that overlook Fairmont’s charming Rooftop Garden, a sublime spot for exchanging vows. The Crown Room, named for its spectacular location on the top floor of the hotel’s 24-story Tower Building, boasts one of the best views in the city: Tall wraparound windows reveal a sweeping 270-degree panorama of the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges, Coit Tower, Alcatraz, Downtown, and the Twin Peaks. The setting here is already unparalleled, but if you really want to have the ultimate reception, opt for the Presidential Service—each table has its own white-gloved waiter.

For a truly elite event, consider the 6,000-square-foot Penthouse Suite, a palatial residence spanning the entire eighth floor of the main building. Following a $2 million enhancement, this incredible venue features a living room with a grand piano, a formal dining room that seats 60, a two-story circular library, a billiard room, a breathtaking terrace with sweeping views of the San Francisco skyline and bay, and three oversized bedrooms. When you reserve the Penthouse, you and your guests have exclusive use of this world-renowned space (often noted as one of the top suites in the world), and are free to flow from one lovely room to another throughout the celebration.

If your event is more of an intimate affair, Fairmont has a vast array of beautiful smaller banquet rooms. For a more casual take on rehearsal dinners and post-wedding gatherings, The Tonga Room & Hurricane Bar—an internationally iconic tiki venue—is a popular and unique choice, offering island-inspired cuisine in a tropical setting…complete with an occasional jungle rainstorm over a romantic lagoon.
