## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its cool, industrial chic-meets-modern design** (think whitewashed exposed brick, oversized vintage windows, rustic chandeliers, and glass roll-up doors), this space is a gorgeous blank canvas that works with virtually any décor. 
  * **Start your day with a quick photo trip—** the venue is just minutes from a host of stunning and varied locations, including Davidson Mesa Trailhead, the Louisville Arboretum, Harper Lake, a lovely park, and the charming streets of downtown Louisville.
  * **There are separate spots for both your ceremony and reception,** so you won’t have any awkward “flip” time. An attached terrace is a lovely place to enjoy your cocktail hour, and their generous 11-hour rental window ensures a leisurely setup and cleanup.
