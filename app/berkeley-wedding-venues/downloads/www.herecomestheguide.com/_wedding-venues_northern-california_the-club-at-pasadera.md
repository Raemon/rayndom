## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

In the sun-splashed hills outside Monterey lies a secluded, 575-acre gated community of breathtaking beauty. Here, the cloud-tipped Santa Lucia Mountains trace the horizon, while closer in, herons feed at crystal-blue lakes. The beguiling landscape is a harmonious blend of tame and wild, and as you pass through the ornate wrought-iron entry gates, native grasses, cypress and oak trees give way to manicured greenery flecked with colorful blooms. The centerpiece of this exclusive enclave is TPC Monterey at Pasadera, an oasis of luxury and hospitality that (luckily!) welcomes nonresidents to celebrate their most special occasions.

The recently redesigned clubhouse takes its inspiration from the region’s Spanish Colonial heritage, with a traditional red-tile roof and ivy-clad façade. The hacienda-style layout is perfectly suited for parties, with a cobblestone courtyard at the entrance a favorite spot for wedding ceremonies. Guests are greeted by a splashing triple-tiered fountain, a 100-year-old oak tree and jasmine-scented air. At one end of the courtyard, an arched stone wall and textured wooden gate frames the couple, with the undulating mountains in the distance. As dusk descends, a myriad of fairy lights makes the courtyard positively enchanting.

It’s even more amazing indoors. Step into the circular tiled foyer and take in the wrought-iron chandelier, frescoes and soaring cupola tower that recall a Moorish castle. The clubhouse’s decorative theme is pan-Mediterranean, with hand-painted ceiling borders alternately reflecting ancient Roman and Egyptian motifs. A handpicked selection of antique furnishings and accent pieces exhibits both tasteful restraint and global panache. The club’s event-friendly layout lets you move guests easily among several adjoining indoor/outdoor spaces. The Library is a comfortable place for pre-wedding mingling. The inviting Fireplace Patio has tiled details and French doors that open into the Lounge, which includes a full wooden bar—all perfect for your social hour. Next comes the Living Room, boasting plush seating, its own fireplace and a grand piano. A lofty, arched picture window is a photo-worthy backdrop for the wedding cake.

Indoor receptions are held in the Dining Room, a handsome re-imagining of Old World opulence. A vaulted, open wood-beamed ceiling contrasts with the gleaming tile floor, while magnificent fireplaces at both ends lend warmth and distinction. Elaborate gold leaf designs of palm fronds and arabesques on the walls give the grand space both dramatic flourish and a soft luster.

French doors along one wall open onto the surrounding patio, which embraces a view of the hills, a sparkling lake and the sweeping Event Lawn. The focal point is a splendid oak tree, and whether you dress the area with colorful lanterns and lounge furniture around a dance floor, or elegantly outfitted dining tables and Chiavari chairs, the picturesque environs define spectacular.

There’s still more to love about this place: The wedding party can reserve the club’s Lodge for the wedding weekend: This luxe hideaway comes with five private guest suites, a shared family room, kitchenette and entertainment rooom. Couples consistently give rave reviews about the amazing staff, who will execute your vision with aplomb. Also scoring “five stars” is the cuisine, thanks to the talented chef who customizes the menu to your personal taste.

A recent wedding guest perhaps sums up TPC Monterey at Pasadera’s extraordinary appeal best: “Flawless, classic and timeless!”
