## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  
**Grounds for Sculpture is such a unique Hamilton Township wedding location:**

  * **Art enthusiasts will love it:** Built in 1992 to foster appreciation for modern sculpture, the venue wows guests with 42-acres of landscaped grounds dotted with over 270 pieces.
  * **The event spaces are versatile:** All the private rooms in the Seward Center for the Arts offer high ceilings, neutral wall colors, and floor-to-ceiling windows with generous views of the outdoor sculptures.
  * **The food is divine:** Catering is provided by Constellation Culinary Group at the popular Rat’s Restaurant on site, which Hamilton Township natives know for its scrumptious cuisine, Zagat-rated ambiance, and attentive service.
  * **It’s conveniently located:** Less than an hour from Philadelphia and New York—and just minutes from Princeton and the Hamilton and Trenton train stations!—it’s an easy trip for guests from all over. Parking’s also free!
