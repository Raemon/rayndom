## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Built in 1892, this exquisite Queen Anne manor is nestled in Atlanta’s historic Inman Park,** the city’s first suburb and the home of dozens of artfully preserved Victorians. Breathtaking original details include a three-story turret, beveled and leaded glass windows, and a grand switchback staircase. 
  * **Celebrations are held in the colorful garden,** though the charming covered porch or gracious living room may be used in the event of rain. The venue’s focus is on bespoke, intimate weddings that ensure you have time to savor both the space and this special time with your loved ones. 
  * **Your micro-wedding package includes overnight accommodations for up to eight guests,** with ample additional lodging available nearby. Welcome bags, a mimosa bar, and a delectable charcuterie board are just a few of their thoughtful package add-ons.
