## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This dreamy resort overlooks both Siletz Bay and the vast Pacific,** with unobstructed views of the water and forested bluffs. It’s an easy drive from both Portland and Salem, making it an appealing choice for both locals and travelers.
  * **Host a ceremony in the peaceful Glen,** beneath a wood arbor sheltered by towering pines, or on the Event Lawn, with its sweeping backdrop of the Lodge’s breathtaking surroundings. Outdoor receptions can continue on the Lawn, or move to one of the rustic-elegant indoor spaces, which are all artfully appointed and can accommodate celebrations both grand and intimate. 
  * **The rooms and suites are spacious, light-filled, and stylish,** and guests will have no shortage of diversions throughout their stay, between the seaside golf course, on-site spa oasis, and miles of coastal hiking trails.
