## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on one of the most desirable slices of beachfront in Southern California,** this elegant club knows its superpower. Glorious white sand stretches 100 yards from the clubhouse to the breaking surf, and from the second-floor deck there's a 180-degree panorama of the vast Pacific and miles of Malibu coastline. 
  * **Ceremonies on the expansive oceanfront deck are backed by glorious Pacific panoramas.** While the newlyweds snap photos on the sugar-sand beach, guests are welcome stay and mingle al fresco, savoring the views. As the reception unfolds indoors, this outdoor space remains an inviting escape for a breath of sea air between spins on the dance floor.
  * **Floor-to-ceiling windows and glass doors span the length of the banquet room,** encouraging an easy flow between inside and out. The bright and airy sapce boasts a high vaulted and arched ceiling, driftwood-colored floor, and ceilings draped with Georgette chiffon, twinkle lights, and crystal chandeliers.
