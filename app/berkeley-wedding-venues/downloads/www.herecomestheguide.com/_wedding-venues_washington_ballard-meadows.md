## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Operated by a couple with over a decade of wedding coordination experience,** this pretty property just north of Spokane is a true labor of love. The owners are continuously working to add amenities, upgrade existing ones, and further beautify an already-beautiful location. 
  * **The Main Lawn’s wooden wedding arbor** frames a natural backdrop of meadows and trees, and offers ample space for large ceremonies. Meadow Hall offers a rustic-modern spot for indoor receptions; it may be combined with its attached covered patio for large celebrations. 
  * **The Cottage and The Cabin** are your inviting, well-appointed “ready rooms”; each has been outfitted with everything you need to prepare for the day, and each is gorgeously styled, ensuring swoony photos.
