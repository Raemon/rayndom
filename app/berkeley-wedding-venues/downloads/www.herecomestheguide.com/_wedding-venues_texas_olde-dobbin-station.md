## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Exchange vows in a completely transformed "chapel"** that was once an 1880s pump station for a nearby stream. In fact, this entire venue has been repurposed into one of the most unique wedding and event settings around.
  * **Historic McCoy Station, a striking reception site** , is the largest of the three buildings. Its soaring, peaked ceiling, archways, exposed pipework, and glowing chandeliers offer a dramatic backdrop that can be customized to your style.
  * **Photo possibilities here are fantastic.** Start with portraits and group shots in front of the ornately carved main door, and have fun juxtaposing the industrial-style historic structures with the flower-bedecked, woodsy grounds.
