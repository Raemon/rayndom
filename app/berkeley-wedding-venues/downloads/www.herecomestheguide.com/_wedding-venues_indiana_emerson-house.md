## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled at the heart of lush woodland** in La Porte county’s “Indiana Dunes country”, this secluded, peaceful event venue is replete with natural beauty. Within its 30 acres, you’ll find a babbling creek, tranquil walking trails, and a large, grassy meadow. 
  * **Picture saying “I do” beneath the graceful weeping willows,** followed by lawn games and trampoline fun for the kids (or perhaps a grown-up or two?) As the party winds down, you can continue reveling under the stars, or move inside for hot cocoa by the fire.
  * **Your package encompasses a full three-day wedding weekend,** which you can curate precisely to meet your needs. Included are accommodations for up to 18 people in the wonderful on-site home, which also serve as a celebration space, thanks to its spacious first-floor common rooms.
