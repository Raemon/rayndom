## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **From this family-owned winery's prime spot at the center of the picturesque Temecula Valley,** gentle hills of vines stretch out in all directions, and lush orchards scent the air with a delicate bouquet of citrus blossoms. At its heart is the impressive Tuscan-inspired tasting room—with its natural stone walls, terracotta-tiled roof, and soaring campanile, the building would be right at home in the Mediterranean countryside. 
  * **The beautiful Vineyard Lawn offers plenty of space for all-outdoor celebrations.** A pretty paved walkway leads to your ceremony site, set on a raised platform with a wooden arbor wrapped in climbing vines. Hold your cocktail hour beneath a shady pergola, then dine on the lawn by the glimmer of bistro lights as a fire crackles in the brick-and-stone hearth. 
  * **The Barrel Room offers the best of both indoors and out.** Say "I do" in the Wedding Gazebo just steps away, followed by cocktails in the cozy room itself. Dinner and dancing take place on the adjoining lawn, which has ample space for a lounge area and lawn games, and a gorgeous view of Mount Palomar. As the hour grows later, you can move the party back into the Barrel Room and carry on with the festivities a little longer.
