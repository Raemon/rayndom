## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This inviting pub sits at the water’s edge** , in the heart of one of the Oregon Coast’s most charming hamlets. It’s known as “Your Little Beach Town” for good reason—welcoming locals and a relaxed spirit have made Pacific City a favorite coastal destination for generations. 
  * **Enjoy panoramic ocean views all day…and into the night.** Wed directly on the sand on the Pelican’s secluded beach, with Haystack Rock in the background, rising up dramatically from the crashing waves. Follow with dining and dancing in the pub, where large French doors open to let in the striking vistas.
  * **There’s no need to rush back to “real life”.** Pelican has relationships with some seriously awesome overnight options, including the cute Cottages at Cape Kiwanda right next door, the luxurious Inn at Cape Kiwanda (which boasts a full-service spa and oceanview suites) and the Headlands Lodge on the Oregon Coast (with oceanfront guest rooms and cottages).
