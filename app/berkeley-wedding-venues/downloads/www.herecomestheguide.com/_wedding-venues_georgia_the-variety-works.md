## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The updated building and grounds are full of historical charm.** This former manufacturing facility dating back to the 1870s has a timeless feel and a rustic-yet-refined ambiance, plus a touch of Old World European elegance.
  * **Glowing chandeliers hang from the airy two-story ceiling** inside the main hall, which can host both your ceremony and your reception. The large, gorgeously renovated space features warm wood walls and industrial-chic accents.
  * **A terrace overlooks the gardens and gazebo** on the lushly landscaped property. There's also a picturesque event lawn for an outdoor walk down the aisle or dining and dancing under the stars. Whatever you choose, tables and padded guest chairs are available for your use.
