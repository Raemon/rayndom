## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A stunning 1850s Gothic Revival estate with the charm of the Lowcountry,** this remarkable home is surrounded by 12 acres that boast meadows, a private freshwater lagoon, century-old oaks and magnolia trees, and lush marshes along the flowing Colleton River. You're welcome to bring your own favorite vendors, or work with their preferred list, ensuring you've got exactly what you need for a picture-perfect celebration.
  * **Weddings here are fully outdoor affairs,** with ceremonies held**** beneath the branches of a moss-draped oak, and cocktail hours that unfold across the soft lawn or in the lovely garden. Al fresco receptions may be held open to the sky or beneath an airy tent: either way, you'll love the chance to dance the night away under the stars.
  * **Host up to 12 guests in the mansion for the weekend.** Featuring large, comfortable bedrooms and spa-like bathrooms, it feels made for entertaining, with fun features like a pool, billiards room, library, and outdoor entertaining space.
