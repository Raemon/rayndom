## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This grande dame of old glamour got a multimillion dollar makeover.** One of the first resorts along the famed Ocean Mile, this historic venue continues to lure A-listers with its private beach, spectacular views and relaxed atmosphere. 
  * **Say “I do” with sand between your toes and waves lapping in the background,** or enjoy a bird’s-eye view from the 11th-floor balcony where the ocean spreads out below you. Either way, the vistas are unforgettable, and continue once the party shifts to the exquisite Oceanfront Ballroom. Those same Atlantic panoramas dazzle your guests during more intimate soirees in one of the resort’s modern, state-of-the-art penthouses. 
  * **Packages are truly all-inclusive—** music, lighting, décor, and even photography are covered—and are fully customizable to your needs and budget. A member of their knowledgable events team will guide you through the whole process, making both local and long-distance planning a breeze.
