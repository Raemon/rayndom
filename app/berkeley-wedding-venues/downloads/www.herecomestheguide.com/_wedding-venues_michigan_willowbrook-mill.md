## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked in the waterfront village of Northport, this historic mill** feels like a hidden gem on the Leelanau Peninsula. One wedding per weekend means room to breathe with access the day before for setup and the day after for teardown (and the opportunity for couples and their guests to enjoy a destination-style getaway in Michigan’s gorgeous wine country!)
  * **Photo ops abound: Snap romantic portraits on the elevated walkway,** beside the vintage waterwheel, or walk a block to the waterfront for epic golden hour shots along Grand Traverse Bay.
  * **A year-round charmer,** it’s just as lovely for summer garden parties on the patio as it is for winter wonderland weddings by the roaring fire inside. Everything from elopements to intimate gatherings of up to 100 can be accommodated, making it perfect for couples who want intimacy without compromise.
