## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The hilltop ceremony site is breathtaking** , with a natural altar created by mature shade trees, and sweeping views of the surrounding countryside and the Southwest Mountain range.
  * **You have a choice of three barn/pavilions for your reception,** each offering a perfect indoor/outdoor flow: the Cox Mill Pavilion, a lovely converted barn, the Black Meadow Pavilion, with its huge deck and magnificent mountain views, and a dreamy pondside tented facility just right for budget-minded couples.
  * **Up to 60 overnight guests can be accommodated in the Manor House and cottages.** Your nearest and dearest will love these luxury vacation homes, and staying on site gives them the opportunity to enjoy the property’s fire pits, fishing ponds, and hiking trails.
