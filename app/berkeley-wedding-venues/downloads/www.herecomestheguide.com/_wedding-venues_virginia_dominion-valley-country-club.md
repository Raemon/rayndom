## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Less than an hour's drive from D.C.** and tucked into Virginia's verdant countryside, this pretty, well-appointed country club offers fabulous indoor and outdoor event spaces, a friendly, knowledgable event staff, and simple, affordable packages that keep planning sane and stress-free.
  * **Your ceremony choices are all beautiful,** and have been designed to take advantage of the stunning property. Be sure to wander through the lush surroundings for some wonderful photos featuring the sweeping meadows, romantic walking paths, and a gazebo perched over the tranquil lake.
  * **The newly renovated clubhouse boasts a breezy, coastal-inspired style.** Its lovely traditional ballroom has an ample dance floor, coffered ceiling with dramatic lighting, and large windows that look out across the grounds.
