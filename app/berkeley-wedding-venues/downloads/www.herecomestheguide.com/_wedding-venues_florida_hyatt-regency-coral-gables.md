## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The Court of Lions, a tranquil courtyard with a bubbling fountain at its center** , is a lovely place to exchange vows. As the sun sets, the fountain glows and twinkle lights illuminate the space—it's a dreamy spot for cocktails, a cigar bar, or a unique photo booth.
  * **The grand Hall of Ambassadors****evokes classic Miami glamour,** with 19-foot ceilings studded by dramatic crystal chandeliers. Or, opt for a celebration in the Alcazaba Ballroom, formerly**** an iconic Miami nightclub, which boasts multipaned windows and patio doors that open onto the courtyard for a dreamy indoor/outdoor flow. 
  * **Allow the expert staff to host your full destination wedding weekend.** Start with a welcome reception in the tantalizing Two Sisters Restaurant, and finish with a breezy Farewell Brunch; your guests will love the plush lodgings and near-endless activities just outside the front door.
