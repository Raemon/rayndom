## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This historic country club boasts artfully manicured grounds,** dreamy photo spots, and an experienced staff that delights in creating memorable weddings. Because they only host one celebration per day, you’re guaranteed privacy and the full attention of the caring events team.
  * **The outdoor ceremony space overlooks the course’s beautiful 19th hole,** with its tranquil pond and backdrop of gently sloping hills and mature woodlands. As your guests enjoy cocktail hour, take a few moments to snap pictures around the lush grounds—no bad angles here! 
  * **Styled after an Old World barn,** the clubhouse sets the stage for a stellar reception, with a vaulted, 30-foot ceiling adorned by massive timber trusses, elegant leaded glass windows hung with opulent draperies, a stone fireplace, and a huge hardwood dance floor.
