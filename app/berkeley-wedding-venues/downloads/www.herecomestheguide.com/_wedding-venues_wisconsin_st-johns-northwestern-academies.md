## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The Neo-Gothic buildings dotted across this stunning campus** create striking backdrops for photos, and the facilities available to rent—which include a rappel tower, archery range, and indoor pool—give you some fun options to round out a weekend of fun and games.
  * **Noble Victory Chapel is absolutely breathtaking,** modeled after the Rheims Cathedral in France. With its soaring vaulted ceiling, towering double turrets, and intricate, high-set stained glass windows on every wall, it's a dramatic setting for your ceremony.
  * **The grounds are gorgeous year-round,** offering endless settings for striking photo ops. Capture a kiss beneath the historic stone-and-wrought iron gate, pose with your parents amid the trees' changing leaves, or gather the whole wedding party for portraits before the chapel's stunning facade.
