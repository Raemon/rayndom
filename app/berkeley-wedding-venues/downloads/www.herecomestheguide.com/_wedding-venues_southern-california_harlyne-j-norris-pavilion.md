## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Blending serene al fresco settings with sleekly contemporary event spaces,** this sensational venue—part of an impressive performing arts complex—is perfectly suited to its stylish Palos Verdes Peninsula surroundings. The drama begins in the skylit Lobby, where a soaring ceiling and chic black granite bar provide the perfect introduction to your lucky guests.
  * **The West Terrace, designed with a tranquil stone fountain, Roman colonnades,** and greenery all around,**** is the quintessential spot to tie the knot outside—plus, bistro lights and uplighting add a festive glow at night. Pair it with the adjoining Ballroom, accessible through floor-to-ceiling glass doors, and let the party flow in and out.
  * **The expansive, highly customizable Ballroom is undeniably the star of the show.** Rich cherrywood walls, 14-foot paneled doors, spectacular domed chandeliers, a built-in stage, 12 rows of retractable stadium seating, and magnificent theater lighting maximize your options, and a state-of-the-art sound system ensures you'll enjoy pitch-perfect acoustics.
