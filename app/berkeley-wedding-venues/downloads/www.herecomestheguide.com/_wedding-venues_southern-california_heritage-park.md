## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A delightful refuge in the City of Santa Fe Springs, this six-acre park** offers both beautifully landscaped greenery and a touch of local history. Much of the park is a reconstruction of the elaborate Hawkins Ranch that prospered here in the 1880s, an expansive Victorian wonderland thoughtfully recreated by the city through the use of historic photographs.
  * **The glass conservatory is a stunning backdrop for your ceremony,** with your guests seated on the lawn facing the plant-filled space and the manicured gardens that surround it. Intimate gatherings may be held in the original formal garden, with its lattice arch, ancient yew tree, and cherub statuary; if you’d like a change of scene, take a short walk past the aviary with its exotic birds to celebrate in another part of the estate.
  * **The original Gothic-styled carriage barn is one of the park’s most dramatic buildings.** With your tables set up under the graceful trees in front and the vintage street lamps illuminating the gable-roofed structure and its curlicue trim, you really do feel transported back to a different era (albeit one where you can have a DJ and dancing).
