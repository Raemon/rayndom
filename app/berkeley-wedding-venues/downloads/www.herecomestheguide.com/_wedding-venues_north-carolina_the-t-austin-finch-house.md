## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Let the ornately carved rosewood fireplace serve as the backdrop** for your ceremony in the Library. Like the rest of this stunning Renaissance Revival mansion, the room is filled with exquisite original art, antiques, and period architectural detailing.
  * **For an all-outdoor affair, exchange vows in the garden** , followed by a grand tented reception on the lawn. Intimate weddings can move inside to the Gold Room, where floor-to-ceiling arched windows overlook the manicured grounds. 
  * **There are two fabulous upstairs rooms for your day-of prep** —a club-style lounge for the guys with a pool table, dart board, and TV, and a plushly furnished suite for the gals, with a private dressing room and tons of beautiful natural light.
