## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Farm-to-table meets city-chic at this unique waterfront restaurant** in SF's buzzy Mission Bay neighborhood. The fresh architectural design—which includes an open kitchen, heated patio, and expansive garden and courtyard—provides a lovely setting for your big day, and the delicious contemporary cuisine ensures it's one your guests won't soon forget.
  * **Exchange vows on the Garden Patio overlooking the sparkling Bay,** framed on one side by a plush lawn and on the other by fragrant herbs and landscaped shrubbery. Steps away, guests can enjoy the bocce court, corn hole, and fire pits before convening in Bar & Lounge for passed nibbles and seasonally inspired cocktails and the Main Dining Room for dinner & dancing.
  * **Highlighting fresh ingredients sourced directly from the on-site gardens,** the fare couldn't be more local. For items that can't be grown in-house, the focus remains on sustainability and seasonality: humanely raised meats, cage-free eggs, and Monterey Bay Seafood Watch-certified seafood are incorporated into every menu.
