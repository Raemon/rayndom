## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Imagine sweeping views of the Chicago skyline AND Lake Michigan** as backdrops to your wedding. This city-run gem, which sits on a 91-acre peninsula jutting into the water, feels like the ultimate urban setting and an island escape at the same time.
  * **The Visitors Center, formerly an Art Deco airport terminal** , is a fun spot for everything from your ceremony to dinner and dancing. Or, opt for either the expansive white tent or open-air Pavilion, where you can add splashes of color with LED lighting.
  * **They offer a generous 8-hour rental period and a list of outside vendors** for all your needs. Plus, if you just can't whittle down your guest list, combine the two-story Visitor Center and the tent to accommodate all your nearest and dearest.
