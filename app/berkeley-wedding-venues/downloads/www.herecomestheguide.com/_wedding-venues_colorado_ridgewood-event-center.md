## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on over 200 acres just minutes from Durango,** this lovely property spans the La Plata River, and is dotted with hundreds of shade-giving cottonwood trees. Encircled by a stunning valley panorama, it’s an ideal choice for a nature-forward mountain wedding. 
  * **The banks of the river can serve as your ceremony site,** with cocktails on the lawn and a reception in the gorgeous handcrafted barn. You also have the option for a tented or open-air outdoor dinner, with cake and dancing in the barn. 
  * **There are ample places for overnighters at Blue Lake Ranch,** the center’s on-site lodge. Many of the accommodations have been designed with families and large groups in mind, and feature spacious kitchens and gathering areas, patios, and cozy fireplaces.
