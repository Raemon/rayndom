## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This eco-chic boutique hotel** features 100-year-old reclaimed wood and local granite for its Southern farmstead, modern style. Its commitment to sustainability made it one of the first in the country to earn LEED Gold-certified status.
  * **The Rialto Club, one of several distinctly unique event spaces** , boasts a rotunda, bar, lounge, dining area, and wine cellar. Often used for as a private club or for concerts, this venue has a fun, contemporary ambiance.
  * **Exciting yet intimate, the Gallery displays the work of local artists.** Bathed with light from 10-foot-tall windows, it's often set with custom farm tables. This same sophisticated nod to art and design is visible in the hotel's upscale guest rooms.
