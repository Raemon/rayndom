## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled along a peaceful inlet of Lake Michigan** and boasting dreamy water and harbor views, this purpose-built venue has relaxed, backyard-inspired vibes and a great location in Ludington, one of the area’s most popular destination beach towns. 
  * **Wed on a manicured lawn with the peaceful marina as your backdrop—** it’s got plenty of space for post-ceremony cocktails and games, and a cozy fire pit, too. The airy, modern reception hall is just steps away, and features a mezzanine level overlooking the entire space, as well as an adjacent terrace. 
  * **Your twelve-hour rental window** ensures your day need never feel rushed, and their packages—even most opulent options—are wonderfully affordable, and always include the help of the Lake House’s talented and helpful events team.
