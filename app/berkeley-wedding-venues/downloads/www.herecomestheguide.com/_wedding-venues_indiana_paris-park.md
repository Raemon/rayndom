## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Twenty-four acres of pastures, wildflower fields, and mature trees** surround this pastoral private venue in the low hills of Southern Indiana. It was purpose-built to capture the charm of a homey backyard wedding, while providing all the amenities needed for a stress-free experience. 
  * **A lovely dedicated ceremony spot beside a lake** ensures your vows are both romantic and photo-friendly. For the reception, there’s a cool open-sided pavilion and a rustic-modern barn. Two finely appointed dressing suites are also included in your package. 
  * **It’s veteran-owned and family-operated,** and the caretakers are dedicated to fostering a gracious, family-friendly atmosphere. We’re also more than a little in love with the resident fluffy Highland cows Isabelle and Remington, and their handsome horse friends Audrey and Traveler.
