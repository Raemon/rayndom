## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked at the west end of Fremont Street,** this cool space is a mix of neighborhood bar, vintage-chic club, and swanky cocktail lounge, boasting views of downtown’s iconic neon landscape, and within walking distance of loads of hotels and restaurants. 
  * **Eclectic, whimsical design touches and moody retro vibes set the club apart from other downtown venues;** it feels welcoming and historic, with a cheeky dose of glam. Upstairs, you’ll find an open-air rooftop space with one of the best sound systems around, and plenty of room to groove. 
  * **Hidden inside the club behind a secret stairwell entrance,** Laundry Room takes its name from its former life as the laundry room for the El Cortez Hotel across the street, whose neon pink sign still towers over downtown. Here, guests revel in intimate, speakeasy glamour, while master cocktail craftspeople work their magic.
