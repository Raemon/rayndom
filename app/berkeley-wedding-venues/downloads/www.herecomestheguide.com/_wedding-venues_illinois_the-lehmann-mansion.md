## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Built at the turn of the century,** this graceful manor home is surrounded by manicured, park-like grounds and boasts plenty of choices for indoor and outdoor events of all sizes.
  * **Intimate celebrations may be held in the mansion itself,** where you’ll find artfully restored millwork, period wall coverings, and gleaming hardwood floors. Vintage artwork and furnishings enhance the aura of timeless elegance. 
  * **Grand affairs are best suited for the opulent outdoor wedding tent.** Draped with swaths of fabric and featuring twinkle lights and chandeliers, it’s an ultra-romantic setting…especially when paired with a garden ceremony beneath the striking white pergola.
