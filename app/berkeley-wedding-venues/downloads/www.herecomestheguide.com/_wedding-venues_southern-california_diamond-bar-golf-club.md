## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Vibrant fairways, bordered by tall shade trees, seem to run off into infinity** at this popular golf course nestled at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains. The whole property is truly dreamy, with plenty of scenic, photo-worthy spots, including a sparkling lake, three pretty arched bridges, and romantic bistro-lit oaks.
  * **The Sycamore Wedding Garden, nestled in a secluded world of landscaped lawn and lush foliage** , is a beautiful spot for an al fresco celebration. Separated from the rest of the golf course by a hedge of Italian cypress, you'll feel worlds away from the hustle and bustle, backed by lovely panoramas of tree-dotted fairways melding into the hills in the distance.
  * **Dramatic trusses span the lofty, cathedral ceiling of the Diamond View Room,** with tall windows on two sides framing views of the Event Lawn and manicured landscape beyond. Here, you'll enjoy delectable, customizable menus fit for the most discerning foodies and dancing on an impressive wall-to-wall dance floor.
