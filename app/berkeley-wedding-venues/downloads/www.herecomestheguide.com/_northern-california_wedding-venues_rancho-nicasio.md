## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set in the sunkissed center of picture-perfect Marin County, this enchanting venue** is the beating heart of the quaint town of Nicasio. A beloved gathering place for both locals and those seeking a quiet retreat from the hustle and bustle, it's clad with a Spanish-style white stucco façade, red trim, sloping tile roof, and long porch that set it apart from its Victorian cousins.
  * **The region's lovely weather means al fresco ceremonies may be held year-round** on a velvety green lawn, which boasts a charming vine-festooned gazebo and sweeping views of distant pastures, farm buildings and soft-shouldered knolls. Afterwards, guests can socialize by the full-service outdoor bar on the lawn’s east side or in the quintessential Western barroom beneath the glow of wagon wheel chandeliers.
  * **Inside, the Rancho Room is well-equipped for grand celebrations,** with beautiful wooden ceiling trusses, brass-trimmed fixtures, a permanent oak dance floor, and a built-in stage equipped with professional lighting and sound (it is West Marin’s main live music venue). There’s a touch of whimsy, too: The moose head above the fireplace wears different hats throughout the year.
