## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This historic Maine B &B has been charming guests since 1904 **with its blufftop location and unforgettable views of Harmon's Harbor and the Atlantic ocean. With easy access to several of the state’s quaint coastal towns and Maine's beautiful beaches, it’s a wonderful option for a full wedding weekend.
  * **Say “I Do”overlooking the harbor and ruggedly rocky coastline.** Intimate affairs will then move to BLUE, the on-site restaurant, where guests can enjoy more ocean views from the covered porch. Larger events are held beneath a graceful tent that offers a sweeping panorama of the Atlantic. 
  * **Most guest rooms boast views of the water,** and all feature private bathrooms and tasteful, coastal-inspired décor. Best of all, your stay includes continental breakfast courtesy of BLUE.
