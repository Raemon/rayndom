## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A true Huntsville treasure,** these stunning gardens are also home to an impressive Greek Revival guest center, giving you both indoor and outdoor year-round options.
  * **Say "I do" beneath the arbor in the Meadow at Lake Lonnie,** with the lake's graceful fountain adding to your lush backdrop. Then, celebrate in the opulent Grand Hall or the more intimate Carriage House—each is uniquely lovely.
  * **They offer a broad range of packages,** from simple "walk-in" weddings to lavish affairs. Best yet? Your rental fee helps support and maintain the Botanical Gardens for future generations!
