## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Hidden within the natural wonderland of Minnesota’s lush North Woods,** this magnificent venue makes the most of its setting, with distinctive, Scandavian-influenced architecture that artfully melds with its lush, woodsy surroundings. 
  * **Arbor in the Pines is your romantic “outdoor chapel”,** where you’ll exchange vows in a quiet forest clearing. The sleek, two-story reception venue features both indoor and outdoor gathering areas, and is able to host celebrations in any season. 
  * **The thoughtfully curated Lodge sleeps sixteen guests in style and comfort.** Spend the days basking in peaceful seclusion, or make a quick trip into one of the nearby towns to discover shopping, restaurants, and night life.
