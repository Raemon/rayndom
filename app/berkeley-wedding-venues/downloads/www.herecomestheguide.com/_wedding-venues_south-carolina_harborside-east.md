## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located on the edge of Charleston Harbor** where the Charles River meets the Atlantic Ocean, this event center features gorgeous views of the coastline and the Arthur Ravenel Bridge. It's especially lovely at night, with the twinkling city lights on the horizon.
  * **Multiple outdoor ceremony locations** allow you to choose your favorite waterfront view. Courtyards, meadows, and lush lawns lined with palm trees offer delightful photo opportunities throughout the meticulously maintained grounds.
  * **The reception hall's elegantly modern interior** includes sleek lighting fixtures and stainless steel bar tables with coordinating silver Chiavari chairs. Outside, the partially covered patio comes with wrought-iron furniture, welcoming guests to mingle in the evening air.
