## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This hilltop winery****exudes cool California elegance,** thanks to epic views and fresh, contemporary design. Estate-grown Rhone wines, paired with locally sourced, Central Coast-inspired cuisine, encapsulate this dynamic, setting the stage for your truly distinctive celebration.
  * **After your "I do"s among the vines and ancient oaks, retire to the chic, industrial-inspired Barrel Room,** which boasts four glass bay doors that open onto a breezy covered veranda. Al fresco celebrations are equally lovely, with glowing bistro lights accentuating the magic of a Paso Robles golden hour.
  * **Invite your guests to join you for a weekend-long Wine Country escape,** with lodging in the unique, ultra-modern Geneseo Inn, chef-prepared gourmet dining, and the option to add fun CASS CAMP activities, like archery, cooking competitions, and horseback riding.
