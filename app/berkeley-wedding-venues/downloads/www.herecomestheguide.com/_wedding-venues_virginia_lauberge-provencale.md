  * **Exchange “I dos” surrounded by flowers in the romantic garden,** with a celebration that continues throughout the manor house, which includes a terrace and porch. The picturesque setting includes a culinary garden and orchard, which offers the perfect backdrop for enjoying a gourmet farm-to-table menu, designed for you by the Executive Chef.
  * **The B &B’s eleven guest rooms are as charming as can be, **with cozy, stylish furnishings and large windows overlooking the grounds. Three additional and equally lovely rooms are available at the inn’s sister property, Villa la Campagnette, just three miles away.
