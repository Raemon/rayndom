## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on 13 gloriously landscaped acres, this outdoor history museum** offers convenience and affordability in a fabulous location—Naperville is a great suburb, easily accessed from all of the Chicagoland area. The facility has free parking, handicap accessibility, air-conditioned buildings, flexible rental hours, and a great list of reasonably priced vendor partners.
  * **Ceremonies are held in a gorgeous historic nondenominational chapel.** This 1864 Gothic Revival gem features the original stained-glass windows, curved buttresses, carved pews, and decorative hand stenciling. The curved, dark wood buttresses and globe lighting help create a mood that’s dramatic and elegant.
  * **Dine and dance in the elegant, modern Birck Family Innovation Gateway reception hall** , where floor-to-ceiling windows showcase views of the museum's verdant green spaces. Or, opt for one of their other unique offerings: there’s a hall on the lower level of the chapel, as well shaded picnic grounds, a vintage whitewashed meeting house—even a reconstructed 19th-century tavern!
