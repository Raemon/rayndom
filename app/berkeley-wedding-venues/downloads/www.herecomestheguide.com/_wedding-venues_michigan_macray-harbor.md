## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This sophisticated event space offers both world-class service** _**and**_**world-class views** from its prime location at the edge of Lake St. Clair. An experienced events team are on hand every step of the way, and generous, affordable packages make planning a breeze.
  * **A large white pergola frames your exchange of vows,** set on a stone patio overlooking the picturesque waterfront. From here, you can explore the 80-acre property to capture romantic photos on the plush lawns and floating piers as a golden glow illuminates the sky.
  * **Sweeping, unobstructed views of the sparkling lake** can be enjoyed from all of the chic, contemporary ballrooms, thanks to bright windows and floor-to-ceiling walls of glass. The Grand Ballroom is a particular favorite, with its mirror-sleek dance floor, cloud-like lighting fixtures, and rich wood accents.
