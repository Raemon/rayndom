## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Boasting diverse event venues and endless flexibility, this events mecca easily sparks the imagination.** The spacious facilities spread out in a series of lofty buildings joined together by open spaces, encouraging an easy flow... plus, the affordable rates always include ample free parking, an open vendor policy, and the ability to party until midnight.
  * **Sleek, modern design elevates the Toyota Meeting Room to a best-in-class reception venue.** An entire wall of glass doors opens onto the Torino Festival Plaza, an inner courtyard that accommodates an outdoor ceremony, tented seating, or simply affords diners a place to mingle in the fresh air. 
  * **Intimate al fresco gatherings find a serene setting in the Pine Wind Japanese Garden,** which contains two waterfalls, a small stream and a pond. The wide modern fountain by the entrance releases a continuous sheet of falling water; the more romantic rock-lined waterfall in the garden's center serves as a beautiful backdrop for a ceremony or photo shoot. 



### PRICES: _What's this going to cost?_

###### Rental Fee

  * The rental fee varies depending on the space reserved and event duration.  


The rate for weddings is $81–205/hour. Setup and staff charges are additional.
