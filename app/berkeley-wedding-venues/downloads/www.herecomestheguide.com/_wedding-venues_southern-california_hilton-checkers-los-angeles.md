## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Designed in 1927 by Charles F.****Whittlesey****, this sophisticated hotel is truly a piece of Los Angeles history.** It's also ideally located for both locals and out-of-towners, set in the heart of the Financial District within a mile of Crypto.com Arena, L.A. Live, and the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
  * **The rooftop terrace boasts spectacular panoramic views of the city's skyline,** offering a one-of-a-kind backdrop for urban-chic weddings. During the day, glass-clad railings erase the distance between you and views that place you in the heart of the hustle; at night the glowing windows of surrounding buildings pair with the sparkling stars for a magnificent atmosphere. 
  * **The award-winning cuisine is matched by the staff's exceptional level of service,** elevating your event and easing the stress of planning. Guests will love the hotel's plush guest rooms, which thoughtfully retain the charm of the structure's history while adding plenty of modern functionality. The newlyweds might treat themselves to an overnight in the luxe Patio Suite, which boasts a two-sided fireplace, chic décor, and marble accents—and a prime location on the rooftop.
