  * **Host a ceremony or cocktails in the courtyard** , where a 1958 Airstream has been turned into a stylish lounge. The comfy prep suite, with kitchen, living room and fireplace, lets friends and family relax and get ready with ease.
  * **Enjoy exclusive use of the venue, an on-site manager** , free adjacent parking, WiFi, interior and exterior market lights...and bragging rights to a fun, unique wedding that guests will be talking about long after it's over.
