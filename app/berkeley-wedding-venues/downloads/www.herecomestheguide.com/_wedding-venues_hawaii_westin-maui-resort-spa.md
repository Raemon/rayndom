## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This breathtaking 12-acre tropical paradise, nestled on Ka'anapali Beach,** is a jewel in the crown of Maui's shoreline. A sweeping oceanfront lawn sits just above a white sand beach and the sparkling azure sea, offering a jaw-dropping backdrop for al fresco celebrations.
  * **Moonlit receptions are held on the gorgeous Aloha Pavilion,** where you'll dine and dance in the company of cascading waterfalls and swaying palm trees, with a star-filled sky overhead. If you can't bear to end the party, continue the celebrations with late-night libations and merriment at the in-house sports bar.
  * **Inclusive packages are carefully customized to fit your vision,** with options ranging from intimate elopements in the sleek Suite 288 to grand, multi-day soirees with curated activities. We particularly love the authentic island touches, like traditional Hawaiian oli blessings, conch shell blowings, leis, and live musicians.
