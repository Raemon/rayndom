## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled In the Sierra Nevada foothills’ town of Grass Valley, a charming historic landmark has recently been reimagined with a modern luxury vibe.** The Holbrooke Hotel has a rustic-yet-refined ambiance with plenty of unique touches to make your stay here – and your celebration – a memorable experience. 
  * **The hotel's "back yard" boasts a vintage treasure: A private garden that adjoins the Purcell Carriage House, whose quaint front porch is just the spot for exchanging vows.** (Tip: Book out its 11 guest rooms for your wedding VIPs!). Move over to the hotel patio for cocktails and open-air receptions, or take the party inside North Star Hall, where a gleaming hardwood floor and cozy brick-and-whitewashed walls are complemented by elevated farm-to-table menus.
  * **The Holbrooke's colorful past includes playing host to presidents, bandits and literary luminaries like Mark Twain.** Today's guests (and intimate after-parties) can enjoy the Iron Door, a sexy cellar bar outfitted with original iron doors that were rumored to lead to a series of underground Gold Rush-era tunnels!
