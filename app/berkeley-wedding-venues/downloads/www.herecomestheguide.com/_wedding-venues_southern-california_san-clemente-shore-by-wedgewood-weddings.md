## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

San Clemente Shore by Wedgewood Weddings offers a relaxed yet elegant country club atmosphere **less than a mile from the beach.** The clubhouse's California Spanish architecture harmonizes effortlessly with the palm tree-studded landscape of the neighboring golf course…but the star attraction is the freshly renovated garden ceremony site, which boasts panoramic fairway vistas, ocean breezes, and peeks of the blue Pacific.   


Guests seated on a pretty lawn edged with white roses and ornamental greenery await the procession, which makes its way down a wedding aisle to a raised stage flanked by more white roses. Here, a wood-beam pergola can be dressed up with garlands or billowy swags, but looks perfectly romantic left _au naturel._ As you exchange vows, a waterfall gently spills over rocks below the platform, and three soaring Eucalyptus trees frame the scene. The setting is utterly enchanting, but if you simply must have a beach wedding ceremony you're in luck: permits are available through the city to say "I do" on sandy shores nearby. You can also tie the knot at the garden, then escape to the beach for photos by the waves.   


While you're off posing for pix, your friends and family will be having a fine time enjoying refreshments back at the Clubhouse Patio. With comfy seating, shade umbrellas, and a brick fire pit, this wide stone-floored terrace encourages guests to mingle as they admire the spectacular view—including a glorious sunset.   


When you're ready for the reception, two sets of French doors open to the Banquet Room, which showcases a beamed cathedral ceiling with ornate iron chandeliers. A soft, neutral palette accommodates any décor, and tall windows let in natural light (and views!) during daytime gatherings. Accommodating larger galas is a cinch—simply fold back the dividing doors, and the adjoining restaurant and private bar are all yours. A built-in dance floor seamlessly takes you from dinner to first dance, and, of course, the Patio is always available for savoring the cool night air and starry sky.

The wedding experts at San Clemente Shore go out of their way to make everything easy and convenient, with packages to suit virtually every couple and suggestions on how to personalize your celebration. They can also add extras like a photo booth, or help you schedule a golf party to ensure your special event is even more memorable
