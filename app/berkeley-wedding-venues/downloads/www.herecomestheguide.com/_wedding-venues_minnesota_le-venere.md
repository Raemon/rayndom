## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Hidden away behind a vintage storefront in St. Paul’s Lowertown,** this special spot has been custom-designed and artfully reimagined for stellar events, by stellar event planners: the pros behind A’bulae, Van Dusen Mansion, and other favorite area venues. 
  * **Poshly adorned dressing suites, a romantic indoor ceremony hall,** a swanky cocktail lounge, and an ornate ballroom—you’ll find each space channeling elements of Art Deco, speakeasy, and 1920s French glam, with just a touch of the contemporary keeping things fun and unexpected. 
  * **For a unique photo opportunity, check out beautiful Mears Park,** just steps from La VENERÉ. With its meandering walking paths, elegant pavilion, trickling stream, and canopy of trees, it offers stunning backdrops that change with the seasons.
