## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Built in 1904, this****charming, three-story Victorian mansion** has long played host to memorable celebrations—in fact, its name is derived from the extravagant holiday parties thrown by its early owners! After a meticulous and loving restoration, it still maintains its authentically romantic feel, boasting all of the original stained-glass windows and gorgeous woodwork that exemplifies the Queen Ann style.
  * **The classic European walled garden is a lovely setting for al fresco ceremonies.** Lined with laurel trees and over 200 white rose bushes, the focal point is a French wire "Birdcage" gazebo, where the couple exchanges vows to the sound of a fountain trickling in the background. Or, follow Victorian tradition and say "I do" in front of the parlor's hearth, decked with shimmering candles; the grand redwood burl staircase makes for a memorable entrance.
  * **Dinner is served beneath the leafy, twinkle-lit boughs of magnolia and guava trees**. The newlyweds share their first dance in the adjacent garden ballroom, complete with crystal chandeliers, multiple grand carved mirrors, and classic topiaries. When the night comes to its end, the wedding party retires to the Inn's lovely suites—a private garden courtyard with a hot tub and a delicious breakfast the morning after extend the celebration.
