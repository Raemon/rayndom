## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This sleek, modern farmhouse-inspired venue is truly stunning,** with six large glass doors that open onto a wraparound veranda and frame views of the rolling fields and bright blue skies. Custom-designed just for weddings, it’s also full of modern amenities, from spacious dressing suites to a full catering kitchen.
  * **Ceremonies can take place anywhere on the expansive 23-acre property** , from the outdoor arbor to the spacious hall itself. There’s also a cozy fire pit with plush lounge seating perfect for mingling as the sun goes down, and even a mini dog park, ensuring your furry family get to have just as much fun as everyone else.
  * **Multiple package tiers keep prices low and planning simple.** DIY-curious couples might opt for a simple venue-only rental or one with a few perks, like day-of coordination, décor, and table settings. For the ultimate hands-off option, there’s the Ready Set Wed package, which features catering, DJ services, florals, and much more.
