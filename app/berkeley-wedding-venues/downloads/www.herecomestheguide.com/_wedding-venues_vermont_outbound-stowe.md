## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Rambling along the banks of the West Branch Little River,** this unique mountain resort features modern, cozy accommodations, the area’s largest outdoor pool, and naturally beautiful grounds surrounded by lush forest. 
  * **Expansive lawns around the property offer plenty of space** for ceremonies and open-air or tented receptions. And for rehearsal dinners and after parties, there’s the Eastside Bar & Bites Restaurant, which boasts a vaulted beamed ceiling, stylish black and white flooring, and an attached patio with bistro lighting and a central fire pit. 
  * **Guests can choose from a variety of cool lodging options:** cottages, traditional hotel-style rooms and suites, and (our favorite!) the cool, Scandanavian-inspired A-frame cabins with soaring floor-to-ceiling windows.
