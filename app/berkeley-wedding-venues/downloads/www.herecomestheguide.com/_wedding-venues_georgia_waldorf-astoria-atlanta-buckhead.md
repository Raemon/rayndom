## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Buckhead is known as the “Beverly Hills of the South”** for being at the heart of Atlanta’s fashion, dining, and cultural scenes, and this stylish hotel places you right in the mix. Combine that with the on-site spa, English Gardens, and pool, and you’ve got the recipe for the perfect wedding weekend.
  * **The artfully manicured grounds can host events both grand and intimate,** and boast lush "secret garden" vibes, with flowering trees and a tranquil reflecting pool. Inside, you’ll discover two classically refined ballrooms that offer lovely views of the gardens. 
  * **Accommodations are among the finest in the area…possibly the world.** The Waldorf’s elegant suites have dreamy features like high ceilings, private terraces, and opulent marble bathrooms. Even the “standard” rooms are anything but—you’ll find decadent toiletries, deep soaking tubs, and plush furnishings within each one.
