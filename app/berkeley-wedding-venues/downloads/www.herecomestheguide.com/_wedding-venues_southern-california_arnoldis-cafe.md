## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This beloved restaurant and event space is a Santa Barbara institution,** with a legacy of providing delicious Italian cuisine and impeccable service that dates back to 1939. Intimate weddings are a specialty here, with a focus on what really matters: connecting with loved ones, joyfully declaring your love, and (of course) enjoying exquisite food & drink.
  * **Draped with glowing bistro lights and lush greenery, the Garden Patio offers an airy, romantic ambiance**. Adjacent bocce courts, built in 1940, provide some cocktail hour entertainment, and the sweetly shaded Trellis may be added for additional dining space. The Lake Como Room, adorned with a large hand-painted mural inspired by the owners family's northern Italian roots from Lake Como, is a lovely spot for small seated dinner parties.
  * **Inclusive pricing makes planning easy... and won't break the bank.** Whether you opt for an affordable daytime wedding or a romantic evening soiree, you'll enjoy delicious Italian menus featuring recipes passed down over generations, along with wine, beer, and Basils Paradise + Lavender Garden cocktails served from the city's oldest bar.
