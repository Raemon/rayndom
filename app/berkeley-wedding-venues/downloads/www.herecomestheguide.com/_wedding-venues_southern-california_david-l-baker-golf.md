## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled within Fountain Valley's scenic Mile Square Park, this lovely club and event center** has earned its reputation as a favorite setting for both golf outings and wedding celebrations. The experienced events team love helping couples craft a day that matches their personal style, budget, and desires; affordable rental fees and truly all-inclusive packages (photographer, florals, and DJ, oh my!) keep the stress low and the value sky-high.
  * **Exchange vows in a lovely private courtyard beneath a white arbor,** with your guests looking on from a plush lawn. A pretty fence behind the site creates a sense of intimacy, with manicured hedges, fragrant white roses, and tall trees adding a natural touch. After the "I do"s, explore the emerald greens, sparkling water features, and greenery-lined paths with your photographer, who is sure to love the beautiful surroundings.
  * **Walls of windows in the elegant reception hall bring the outside in and flood the space with light.** Vintage-inspired chandeliers and gauzy drapery are on hand to adjust the ambiance to your preference, with a crisp white color scheme that leaves plenty of room for your color scheme and design. An adjacent covered patio is a lovely spot for al fresco cocktail hours or setting up cozy lounge vignettes that encourage mingling.
