## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Join the iconic list of those who've celebrated at this truly stunning club** —including JFK, Lucille Ball, and Henry Fonda—a charming throwback set in Alameda's historic West End. The impressive surroundings are matched by impressively affordable rental rates, and since the space is city-run, booking feels refreshingly straightforward and low-pressure.
  * **Al fresco ceremonies are lovely in the secluded Terrace Garden,** a pretty expanse of lawn tucked away behind leafy foliage. Just inside is the Terrace Room, a lovely setting for intimate celebrations, with hand-painted floral motifs and green lattice work that echoes the serene atmosphere outside.
  * **The sumptuous Trident Room boasts a rich, comfortable feel,** with a stately fireplace, plush carpets, dark oak paneling and antique crystal chandeliers. The Main Ballroom is equally inviting, with some wonderful architectural flourishes: along one wall, separated from the parquet dance floor by a gleaming brass railing, is a two-foot elevated platform with overstuffed leather booths. It's a lovely spot for your VIPs.
