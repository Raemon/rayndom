## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **Spread over 60 pristine acres within Catskill Park** , this classic mountain inn displays the beauty of nature with gardens, ponds, meadows and a private mile-long stretch along the famed Beaverkill River. And do book the entire inn to turn this into a memorable weekend getaway.
  * **Opt for a tented reception in the meadow or take the celebration inside.** Their much-lauded chef will customize your farm-to-table menu using locally sourced ingredients—including from their own organic garden. 
  * **There's plenty to do in every season** , like hiking, biking, cross-country skiing, tennis or a dip in the indoor pool. You can also try your hand at fly-fishing or just go antiquing. Then satisfy your sweet tooth by building a sundae at the inn's ice cream parlor!
