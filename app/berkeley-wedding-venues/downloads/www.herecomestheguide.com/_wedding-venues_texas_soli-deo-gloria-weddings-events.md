## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on 25 lushly wooded acres, this gorgeous, family-owned venue** offers a serene setting for your celebration. A cozy, two-bedroom cabin, hidden away from the rest of the property, is the perfect place for wedding party prep.
  * **The Chapel, which was meticulously re-crafted from the wood of a 1908 church** , is nestled among towering oak, cedar elm, bois d’arc and cedar trees. Bright windows flood the space with light and bring the outside in, illuminating the whitewashed wood interior and lofted ceiling.
  * **The Party Hall echoes the Chapel’s airy vibes,** with its reclaimed wood construction, walls of windows, and crisp white exterior. Sliding glass doors allow the party to flow outside, where glowing bistro lights create a festive atmosphere among the trees.
