## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The celebration of vibrant contemporary Latin American art** is the mission of this magnificent museum, nestled in the heart of Long Beach's burgeoning East Village Arts District. The modern Latin American identity is a multicultural fusion of past influences, a dynamic combination showcased throughout the venue's diverse galleries and event spaces.
  * **The expansive Sculpture Garden is a favorite setting for ceremonies** and al fresco receptions. Elegant sculptural works are presented throughout the large outdoor plaza, set among flourishing greenery and a gently bubbling water feature, and the state-of-the-art sound and lighting systems will help you bring the space to life.
  * **Encourage your guests to explore the diverse galleries,** or opt for a cocktail hour tour or art workshop to take advantage of the unique setting. Gather for dinner in the sleekly sophisticated Balboa Studio: it has a “black goes with everything” palette, high ceilings, and the flexibility of a blank canvas, offering you the chance to let your own creativity flourish.
