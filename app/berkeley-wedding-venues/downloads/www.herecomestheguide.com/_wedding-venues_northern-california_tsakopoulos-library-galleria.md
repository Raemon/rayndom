## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A dazzling five-story window frames the Atrium, the venue's primary event space.** A second floor wraparound balcony, studded with floor-to-ceiling columns and adorned with oak and hand-tooled iron railings, offers additional seating for larger receptions. Don't miss the bronze fox heads, which gaze down admiringly from their perch.
  * **Distinctive artwork abounds:****_Prismatic Coronas_ , a trio of dramatic glass and steel rings**, is suspended high above the dramatic bronze and terrazzo floors—together, they subtly reflect both natural and artificial light, creating a truly remarkable glow. 
  * **Its central Sacramento location is truly unbeatable,** just across the street from City Hall and steps from Old Town. Even better, your rental fees go directly towards supporting the Sacramento Library—the original building's stunning 1918 facade is right next door.
