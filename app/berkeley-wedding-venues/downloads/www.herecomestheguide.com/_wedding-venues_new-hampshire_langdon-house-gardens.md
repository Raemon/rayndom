## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **George Washington probably slept here.** After all, this magnificent, Georgian estate’s original owner was a Revolutionary leader, signer of the constitution, three-time governor of New Hampshire and a gentleman of obvious great taste when it came to homes!
  * **The spectacular gardens are a true example of living history.** A 100-foot rose and grape arbor (installed more than a century ago!), antique statuary and sweeping lawns surrounded by mature trees, give you a sense of stepping back in time.
  * **Unique outdoor areas abound for your wedding celebration.** From the secluded garden or the pavilion to dining and dancing in a large tented venue, you’ll savor the sweet scent and verdant views of one of New Hampshire’s most beautiful settings.
