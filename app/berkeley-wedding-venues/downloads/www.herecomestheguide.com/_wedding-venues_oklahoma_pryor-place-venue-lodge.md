## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled on 30 acres of lush forests with a pristine pond,** this charming retreat offers the best of both worlds: a spectacular venue for celebrating and a cozy lodge for gathering with your loved ones. The barn-inspired architecture brings together rustic textures and modern finishes for a uniquely lovely setting to say “I do.”
  * **There are endless picturesque backdrops for your exchange of vows:** the modern farmhouse-inspired black doors of the main hall, a lawn backed by breeze-rustled trees, or on a wooden patio overlooking the pond. Inside, the space glows with warm wood tones, market lights, and large windows framing views of the surrounding landscape.
  * **Stay and play in the stylish Lodge,** which boasts fully equipped indoor and outdoor kitchens, an airy living room with a wood-burning fireplace, a patio, and a fire pit. Our favorite part? The resort-style pool: It’s got a hot tub, a 40-foot custom slide, and a spacious sun shelf with water loungers, bar stools, and a basketball hoop.
