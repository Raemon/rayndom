## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **One of the prettiest private golf clubs in the Chicago area,** this picturesque spot sits less than 40 minutes from downtown, and features gently rolling, tree-dotted hills, tranquil water features, and colorful seasonal blooms. They also have a passion for inclusion: LGBTQ+ weddings are warmly welcomed, and they're experienced with cultural celebrations, with plenty of experienced vendor partners on hand. Best of all, hosting an event here is open to members and non-members alike!
  * **The gorgeous al fresco ceremony space** **is set on a stone-paved patio** with a pretty white arbor that perfectly frames a scene of the lush course. After exchanging vows, hop into a golf cart with your photographer to capture images of your post-nuptial bliss throughout the verdant course, landscaped lawns, and lush wetlands.
  * **Inside, you’ll find an expansive ballroom with endless layout options** and lots of room for dancing. If you’d prefer to keep the party entirely outside, you also have the option to host a tented celebration. No matter what you choose, you'll enjoy to the generous support of the in-house events team and talented culinary staff as they help you dream up, plan, and finally bring your vision to life.
