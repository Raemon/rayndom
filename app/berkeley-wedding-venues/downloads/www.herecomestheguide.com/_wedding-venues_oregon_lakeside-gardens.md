## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Amazingly, this seven-acre paradise****is only minutes from downtown** Portland and the airport. Its crystalline lake (complete with swans and ducks), is surrounded by tall cedars, weeping willows and some of the most beautiful gardens you’ve ever seen.
  * **Saying “I do” beneath a domed gazebo at water’s edge** is picturesque enough, but you’ll also love taking photos beside a waterfall or stone bridge. Then continue to enjoy the view with a glass of wine, champagne, or beer on their lakeside stone patio.
  * **Indoor ceremonies and receptions take full advantage of the fabulous vistas.** The large Ballroom’s wall of windows and sliding glass doors frame a lush backdrop for exchanging vows as well as a gracious veranda, fringed by seasonal plantings, that juts out over the water.
