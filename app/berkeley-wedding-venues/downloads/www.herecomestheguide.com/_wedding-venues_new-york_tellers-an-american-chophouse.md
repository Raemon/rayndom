##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Bringing together the very best of past, present, and future,** this elegant steakhouse exudes classic glamour and Old New York style, all in the heart of Long Island. No two weddings are alike here: each exquisite celebration is fully customized by the experienced events team to match your unique style and vision.
  * **With its soaring ceilings, marble columns, and cinematic lighting,** the main dining room beautifully blends Old World grandeur and modern luxury. Every element of the historic space has been thoughtfully restored and reimagined, creating a backdrop that feels both timeless and fresh.
  * **Backed by the celebrated Bohlsen Restaurant group,** Tellers offers an extraordinary culinary experience, with fabulous signature offerings like dry-aged USDA prime steaks, fresh seafood, an award-winning, sommelier-led wine list, and hand-crafted cocktails... all presented with topnotch service and white-glove hospitality.
