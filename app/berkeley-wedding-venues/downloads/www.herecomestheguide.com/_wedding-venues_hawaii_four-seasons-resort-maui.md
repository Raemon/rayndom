## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Embrace the magic of Maui at this glamorous beach resort,** nestled along the golden shores of Wailea Beach. Start your wedding weekend with a personalized spa session and professional hair & makeup at the salon, or lounge in a pool cabana with a fresh cocktail—or do both, with a poolside mini-spa treatment. Pampering is more than a perk here: it's part of the experience. 
  * **At the aptly named Plumeria Point, a natural canopy of sweet-scented plumeria** frame exquisite views of the Pacific and Kahalawai Mountains. A sweeping staircase leads to the magnificent Oceanfront Lawn, a verdant expanse bounded by lush greenery, swaying palms, and boasting a truly magical view of the azure waves lapping the soft sand.
  * **Expect elevated luxury and out-of-this-world service throughout the process.** The team at the Four Seasons will work closely with you to curate your unique celebration, from coordinating guest arrivals and lodging to crafting a delectable menu to creating spectacular event designs that embrace the natural beauty of Maui while incorporating your personal vision.
