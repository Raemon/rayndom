## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Sculptural cypress trees, stone buildings, and rows of lush vines give this exquisite winery** the feel of a Tuscan retreat, despite its prime SoCal location in the picturesque Ramona Valley. Weddings here benefit from affordable rental fees with lots of stellar inclusions, like a sweet prep cottage, lawn games, and furniture, signage, and décor—with a flexible vendor policy that lets you make the day your own.
  * **Ceremonies unfold on a serene lawn, shaded by mature oaks.** After the "I do"s, steal away with your photographer to capture stunning photos throughout the stunning property: on the lakeside dock, amid the sun-kissed hills and twisting vines, or inside the dramatic granite Wine Cave (this is also a perfect spot for a photo booth or bar!).
  * **The villa-inspired Crush House provides a dreamy backdrop for al fresco receptions:** its warm stucco exterior is draped with ivy, large windows are accented with vibrant blue shutters, and verdant hedges and cypress frame the front steps. As the sun sets, glowing bistro lights illuminate the adjacent patio as you dance the night away.
