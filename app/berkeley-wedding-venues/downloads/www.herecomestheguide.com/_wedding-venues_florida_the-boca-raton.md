## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Celebrate your special day amid 200 beautiful waterfront acres.** The dramatic Cathedral Room features a soaring coffered ceiling and is lined with ornate pillars, graceful arches, and floor-to-ceiling windows. The Dunes Ballroom is infused with the colors and textures of the ocean. Old-world elegance is embodied in the Venetian, Valencia and Amalfi, while the Grand and Royal Palm are simply stunning.
  * **You can choose the outdoor space that best fits your ceremony style.** Say ‘I do’ at the edge of the Atlantic Ocean with a backdrop of pristine white sand, or exchange vows at The Cloister Garden, a tranquil retreat highlighted by picturesque fountains and sculptures. The Yacht Club Terrace affords marina views, while calming waterfalls enhance the lush landscape of the Waldorf Astoria Spa Pool Deck and Garden.
  * **Prepare to be pampered.** Exclusive pre- and post-wedding spa and salon services are available for the couple. All guests will revel in the luxury resort experience, whether they’re staying in a guest room or suite at the Beach Club, Yacht Club, the Tower, the Cloister, or the Bungalows.
