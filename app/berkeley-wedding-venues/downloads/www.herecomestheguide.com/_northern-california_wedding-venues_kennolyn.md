## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched atop the scenic Santa Cruz Mountains, this dreamy Mediterranean villa** is surrounded by lush redwood forests and views of the crystal blue Monterey Bay. The serenity of the setting is enhanced by the generous hospitality of Kennolyn's experienced event pros, who will help coordinate the details of their all-inclusive packages and ensure your day unfolds seamlessly.
  * **In the Redwood Grove, a rustic wooden deck is nestled among the ancient trees** and wild flora, creating a magical setting for exchanging vows. Ceremonies are also magnificent on the Hacienda Lawn, surrounded by trees, greenery and an ocean vista.
  * **Cocktail hours unfold in the enchanting Spanish-style Courtyard,** where vine-covered walls and a splashing fountain give off rustic-classy vibes, and guests mingle beneath romantic bistro lights. Dinner-with-a-view is served on a woodsy Terrace that overlooks the bay, before you lead your guests back to the Courtyard for a dance party under the stars. While heat lamps keep the outdoors cozy, your friends and family can also wander inside the Fireplace Lounge for quiet conversations. 



P.S. Kennolyn's neighboring [Stone Creek Village](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/northern-california/kennolyns-stone-creek-village) also makes a perfect wedding weekend retreat!
