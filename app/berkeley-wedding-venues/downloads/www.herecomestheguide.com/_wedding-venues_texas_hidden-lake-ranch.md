## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on a private stunning lake in Lexington,** this rustic-yet-elegant ranch venue brings sunset views, big skies, and an easygoing Texas vibe in a purpose-built events space.
  * **Host your ceremony on a pretty patio overlooking the azure water,** then dine and dance in the cool, modern reception hall, which is outfitted with tall, raftered ceilings, wrought-iron chandeliers, and climate control to keep everyone comfortable no matter the weather.
  * **Plan B is simple without losing the lakeside feel** thanks to a spacious covered patio, an inviting indoor option, and even a tent setup if needed. The gracious al fresco spaces invite mingling, with fire pits for cozy evenings and rolling bars to bring the party wherever you like.
