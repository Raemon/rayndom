## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Fusing Latin American flair with Southern California beach-resort style,** this full-service boutique hotel is ideal for couples looking for value and four-star touches in a lush, tropical atmosphere. The colorful interior appeals to all five senses: its Mayan-inspired décor is vibrant and highly textural, with unexpected touches like the dumbwaiter in the foyer where sangria and tequila drinks are delivered.
  * **With its luxuriant, tropical foliage and misted waterfall, the Jardin de Palmeras** offers an intimate, exotic ceremony setting, while the adjacent Esplanade, shaded by a striking Australian umbrella, exudes a Zen-like vibe. After the "I do"s, join for for a toes-in-the-sand cocktail hour on the adjacent Playa on the Maya, where you can sip champagne while admiring twinkling city lights and the dramatic bridge spanning the port.
  * **The grand Lagunita Pavilion, named for an ancient Mayan city,** perfectly blends the elegance of a ballroom reception and the breeziness of an outdoor soiree. A soaring, cathedral-style ceiling draped in shimmering chandeliers is accentuated by two floor-to-ceiling glass walls that open onto the stunning waterfront Vista del Mar patio, with its towering palms, rock-faced fire pit, and unique water and fire display.
