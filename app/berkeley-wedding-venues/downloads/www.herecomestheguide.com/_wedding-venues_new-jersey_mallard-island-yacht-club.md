## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Beautiful views wherever you look:** Surrounded on three sides by sparkling Barnegat Bay, the club also captivates the eye with a collage of gardens, white picket fences, window boxes overflowing with lush plantings, and manicured landscaping.
  * **Unique event spaces:** Have a candlelit ceremony in the Boathouse Chapel in front of a stacked-stone fireplace with bay views all around, or exchange vows on an expansive flower-bordered lawn against the backdrop of water and sky. Continue the celebration in the elegant ballroom, highlighted by a Tiffany-blue coffered ceiling, romantic chandelier lighting, and detailed woodwork.
  * **Everything you could want in a dressing suite:** Referred to as the "Crown Jewel" of the club, the 3,000-square-foot suite takes up the entire 4th floor. You'll sleep soundly on a king-sized that can be completely enclosed by handmade curtains, while floor-to-ceiling windows offer views of the bay and landscaping.
