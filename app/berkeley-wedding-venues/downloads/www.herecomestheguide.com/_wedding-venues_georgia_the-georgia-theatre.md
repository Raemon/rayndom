## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Built in 1889, this Athens treasure** **has undergone a loving restoration** that has preserved its original charm and creative spirit while updating amenities and adding innovative twists to its grand spaces. 
  * **Put your names in lights on the vintage marquee,** then invite guests to witness your vows on the theatre's stage. Continue the party on the main floor and wraparound mezzanine and let your band or DJ take over the stage for a rockin’ reception. 
  * **The Rooftop is the venue's truly special outdoor spot.** Offering views of both downtown and the University of Georgia campus, it boasts ample seating, a full kitchen and bar, and a large stage equipped with state-of-the-art A/V capabilities.
