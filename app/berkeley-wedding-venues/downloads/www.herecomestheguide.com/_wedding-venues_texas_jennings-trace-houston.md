## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Sleek, contemporary design meets pristine natural beauty****at this refined venue,** nestled on nine acres of lush East Texas woodland. The custom-built event spaces are dramatic and modern, with architecturally dynamic angles, plenty of brick, glass, and metal details, and a chic black-and-white aesthetic that plays beautifully with any style or vision.
  * **You’ll say “I do” before a backdrop of soaring oaks and pines,** whether you opt for an al fresco ceremony or exchange vows in the striking, glass-enclosed Chapel. In the gorgeous modern reception hall, skylights and floor-to-ceiling windows flood the space with natural light and frame more sweeping views, with easy access to the outdoor spaces for a gracious flow.
  * **Thoughtfully curated, tiered all-inclusive packages are a signature** of the Walters Wedding Estates collection.**** Over the past two decades, this family-owned company has curated a distinguished group of Texas and Atlanta venues, all featuring signature customizable package selections and the priceless assistance of kind, dedicated event planners.
