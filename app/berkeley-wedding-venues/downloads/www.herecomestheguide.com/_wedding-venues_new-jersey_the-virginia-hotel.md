## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located in Cape May’s famed historic district, this sophisticated retreat** places you in the heart of it all, just half a block from the beach. Five delightful cottages can be rented together or as individual lodgings, or opt to stay in the hotel in one of 24 well-appointed guest rooms.
  * **The elegant Ebbitt Room showcases gourmet dining** , with fresh ingredients sourced from their very own Beach Plum Farm and a drinks menu that highlights some late 19th-century classics. Tucked behind the hotel you'll find the charming Back Patio: surrounded by greenery, bathed in glowing light, and soothed by a coastal breeze, it's an intimate escape made for romance.
  * **You’ll feel at home away from home.** They’ve thought of everything to make your stay relaxing and enjoyable from the moment you’re welcomed in with a glass of their signature punch, served on the front porch or in front of a roaring fire. Feel like shopping? One of their golf carts can transport you to local shops. Just want to lounge on the beach? They’ll take care of you with chairs, towels, umbrellas, and more.
