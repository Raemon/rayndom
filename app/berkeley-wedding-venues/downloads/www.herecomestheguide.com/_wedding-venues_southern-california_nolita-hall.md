## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A Little Italy hotspot, this first-class restaurant** is also a chic indoor/outdoor oasis perfect for events of all styles and sizes. The entire place can be yours for the evening—or opt for a partial buyout for a more intimate celebration.
  * **The breezy, coastal-inspired interior is bathed in natural light,** thanks to a large glass wall that opens onto the adjacent patio. Walls of live greenery are topped by a gorgeous glass roof that refracts the light, and the view of the city and swaying palms extends all the way to the sparkling, cerulean sea.
  * **Foodies rejoice: delectable menus are custom-crafted** to fit your taste and budget. From one-of-a-kind tasting experiences for your micro-wedding to an expansive, full-service buffet for a traditional reception, your options are truly unlimited… not to mention the extensive wine, beer, and spirits collection.
