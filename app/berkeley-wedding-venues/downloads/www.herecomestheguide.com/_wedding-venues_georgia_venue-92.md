## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This unique event space offers flexible styling.** Featuring polished cement floors, interior brick accents, and silver Chiavari chairs, it can easily host a contemporary or rustic celebration!
  * **Your event will have a wonderful indoor/outdoor flow** , thanks to doors along the back wall that can stay open to the terrace. They also have two outdoor ceremony areas: One is custom-built with a natural wood arbor and flagstone path, and the other is covered so you don't have to worry about the weather.
  * **Their divine "Something Blue" room is a lovely retreat for the wedding party** to relax and get ready. Vintage-style mirrors and a crystal chandelier lend touches of elegance on your big day.
