## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This picturesque wine country Inn is fairy-tale gorgeous,** with historic buildings framed by rolling hills, lush landscaping, and a gorgeous 27-hole championship golf course. The beauty of the surroundings are matched by the venue's experienced wedding planners and award-winning culinary team, who are experts at bringing dream weddings to life.
  * **The Meadows offers a lovely outdoor setting with a rustic ambiance:** here, you'll say "I do" on the ceremony lawn beneath a natural wooden arch that's been exquisitely decorated with flowers and drapes for a sophisticated look. Al fresco gatherings are lovely here as the sun sets, with an arbor-covered lounge outfitted with plush couches, swinging chairs, and fire pits for your guests to cozy up to.
  * **The charming Stone House dates back to the 19th century,** but has since been transformed into an enchanting backdrop for events. Cross a pretty wooden footbridge to exchange vows beneath a bentwood arbor nestled among the twinkle light-draped oaks, then snap photos before the house's vintage wood shutters and little porch and mingle with your loved ones on the soft expanse of lawn.
