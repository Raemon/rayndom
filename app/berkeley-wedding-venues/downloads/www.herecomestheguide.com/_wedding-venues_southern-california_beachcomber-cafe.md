## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Host your quintessential SoCal celebration on the beach at historic Crystal Cove Park,** one of the Newport coast's most celebrated sites. Run by _Beachcomber Catering,_ experts in coastal entertaining, festivities here unfold in with energy and ease. There are adorable and affordable settings for every kind of affair. A host of tiny cottages and event sites dot the property, all offering varying degrees of privacy and communal activity.
  * **The Beaches Cottage, with its sand-strewn terrace and white picket fence** a mere 20 yards from the Pacific, is about as picturesque as you can get. This was the set for the Bette Midler movie, _Beaches,_ as well as a long list of other films over the decades. Exchange vows on the inviting blanket of sand out front, then pop around the fence for cocktails, dinner, cake, and a big dose of charm.
  * **The park-like Commons has cute and quirky surfside event areas,** as well as marvelous ocean and creek views—Trancos Creek meets the sea here. The dedicated catering team will turn your vision into reality by delivering excellent service, incorporating fresh local products, and customizing every aspect of your event, whether you envision food stations, cracked crab and buckets of ice-cold beer, sushi platters, margaritas and mini-ahi tacos, or surf and turf extravaganzas.
