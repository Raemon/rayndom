## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **This stylish, contemporary hotel sits right along the Potomac River.** Blending urban sophistication with a gracious, boutique vibe, it offers prime access to the area’s top attractions, including MGM National Harbor and The Capital Wheel. 
  * **Named for African-American heroes Thurgood Marshall and Harriett Tubman,** the hotel’s two modern, light-filled event rooms boast floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the river. Flexible layouts allow the spaces to be used in a variety of ways, and a neutral color palette of cream and sea tones works with a range of design themes. 
  * **Your guests will love the spacious, sophisticated guest rooms,** most of which boast unique “Cozy Corners” outfitted with inviting sofa-sleepers…the perfect spot to settle in for the evening and enjoy stellar views of the bustling waterfront.
