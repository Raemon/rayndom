## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its broad lawns and period architecture, this magnificent 1924 mansion** might be the backdrop for one of the fictitious revelries in an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. This extraordinary setting is matched by the topnotch service: your exclusive catering and bar are provided by _Colette's,_ a beloved outfit known for fabulous cuisine, stunning cakes, and impeccable attention to detail.
  * **An ornate wrought-iron gazebo sits at the heart of the Italian Gardens,** surrounded by palm-fringed plantings, fragrant roses, and a flurry of colorful blooms. Continue the celebration al fresco in the Center Circle Courtyard, lit by necklaces of twinkling lights, or dine and dance in the estate's main gallery, where a baby grand piano is on hand for musical entertainment and a glass ceiling frames starry views. 
  * **Every room inside is also a gallery, displaying diverse art from around the globe** in rotating exhibits. As your guests mingle in the wood-floored atrium, the wedding party can capture their own gallery-worthy photos throughout: the entry foyer, with its wrought-iron spiral staircase and stained glass windows, is a favorite setting, along with the octagonal solarium, warmed by light flowing in through expansive windows.
