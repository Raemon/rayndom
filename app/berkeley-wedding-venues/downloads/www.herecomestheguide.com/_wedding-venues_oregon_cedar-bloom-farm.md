## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A pretty setting with over a mile of private frontage along the Illinois River** is just the beginning of the dreamy offerings you’ll find at this sweet resort: a working flower farm nestled into the protected Siskiyou National Forest, only 90 minutes from Ashland.
  * **With nearly 100 acres to play with, it’s easy to craft your perfect day.** Cross a wooden footbridge to say “I do” in the Wedding Garden beside the river, or exchange intimate vows by the river itself. Reception options include meadows (one even boasts an awesome stage), and the Tennis Court, which can be easily tented and strung with outdoor lights. 
  * **Enjoy a full wedding weekend relaxing in the custom sauna,** splashing in the river or swimming hole…everyone can stay on site in the Farm’s selection of super fun lodging; among them, a geodesic dome, A-frame cabins, a vintage trailer, a campground (with tipi-style tents to rent), and an adorable “Gnome Dome”.
