## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's Martha's Vineyard's oldest continuously working family farm** , now being lovingly stewarded by its 12th generation of caretakers. Among the 100 waterfront acres, you'll find rustic stone walls, a 200-year-old farmhouse and outbuildings, and some very photogenic horses, miniature donkeys, and sheep. 
  * **Exchange vows beneath a natural log arbor at the edge of Chilmark Pond** , with the south shore's barrier beach and the Atlantic beyond. Follow with cocktails and lawn games on the grass, and a reception in the romantically lit peaked tent. 
  * **Use the historic farmhouse for your day-of preparation** , and after the party winds down, adjourn to the sweet pond-side cottage and fall asleep to the gentle sounds of the water.
