## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The hilltop ceremony site, enveloped by flowering shrubs and bougainvillea,** provides the sheltered privacy of a secret garden. Tall hedges embrace the intimate spot, where a classic gazebo at the far end overlooks the Vista hills. After the "I do"s, retreat to the modern, Mediterranean-style clubhouse to continue the celebration.
  * **Double French doors open to the light-filled reception wing,** whose rooms can be used in whatever combination best suits your event. The spacious Ballrooms' wraparound picture windows offer magnificent views of the verdant fairways and distant hills; a raised white ceiling and contemporary cylindrical chandeliers lend an open, airy feel.

  * **Flexibility and exceptional service are Shadowridge's specialty.** No matter which spaces or package you choose, the highly trained staff will work with you every step of the way to make sure your celebration matches your style and budget so that you get the best possible value.
