## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This impressive venue has you hooked at first glance.** As befitting the home of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, the stonework is amazing, from the grand entry's pillars and steps to the stunning carved statuary—a perfect setting for a wedding portrait.
  * **Pick and choose from five distinct event spaces.** The soaring Main Atrium features marble floors and a wall of windows, while the Lower Atrium is perfect for a stunning cocktail reception followed by dinner and dancing in the luxurious Howard Ballroom.
  * **Want a dramatic ceremony? Stage it in the Beard Auditorium** , complete with state-of-the art AV. Or glide down a marble staircase to say "I do" in the two-level Library. And for something quite unique, arrange for their kilt-clad bagpipers to accompany you.
