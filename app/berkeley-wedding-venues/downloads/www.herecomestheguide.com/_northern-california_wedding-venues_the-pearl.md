## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This modern multi-level space brings together art, nature, and the neighborhood's rich industrial history** in truly magnificent fashion. At its heart, the Main Floor is an expansive, blank canvas with plenty of jaw-dropping accents, like its 31-foot reclaimed cedar ceilings, massive skylights, and one-of-a-kind indoor gardens suspended overhead on historic cranes.
  * **The fabulous Rooftop is unbeatable for scenic ceremonies,** with its sprawling views of the surrounding Dogpatch neighborhood, the Bay, and the Oakland hills. Italian porcelain floors, a terraced garden, and cool skylights bordered by iron drink rails are joined by plush lounge furniture, heaters, and bistro lights; it's easily tented, too, ensuring you're good to go no matter the weather.
  * **The in-house bar program is fabulous, offering local beers and wines on tap, alongside premium spirits.** Their craft cocktails are a specialty, with offerings that range from a hickory-charred old fashioned to a hopped mule, featuring vodka steeped in-house.
