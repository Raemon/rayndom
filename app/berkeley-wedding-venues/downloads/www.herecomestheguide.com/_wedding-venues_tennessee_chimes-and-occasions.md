## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You get the look and feel of an old French chapel in the heart of midtown.** This intimate, nondenominational church setting is enhanced with a Belltower, 15-foot ceiling and tall arched windows that allow natural light to stream in.
  * **Occasions’ rear courtyard is a gem, complete with brick walls and stone cherubs.** A chevron brick floor, antique ironwork and leafy vines make this a romantic spot for a ceremony or cocktails, just two blocks from Overton Square.
  * **Soft adobe colors and a Juliet balcony increase the charm factor.** Inside the two-story building you’ll find vintage woods, marble floors, French doors and brass sconces in the distinctively designed reception areas.
