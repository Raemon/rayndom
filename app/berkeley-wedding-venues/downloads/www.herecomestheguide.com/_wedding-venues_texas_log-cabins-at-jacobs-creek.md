There's also ample space for a tented affair, and a rustic pavilion for intimate dining or a dedicated bar area.
  * **The cozy cabins can accommodate up to 70 overnight guests,** and the option to rent out the space for the weekend ensures you'll have the entire run of the beautiful grounds to yourselves!
