## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Seemingly plucked from the pages of a storybook, this romantic restaurant** is a hidden jewel nestled in Topanga Canyon. Comprised of three interconnected outdoor courtyards and two charming indoor dining rooms, the space can easily transform to accommodate everything from an intimate micro-wedding to a grand, 250-guest soiree. 
  * **The stylish Fountain Patio gets its name from a lovely three-tiered piece at its heart** , often festooned with flowers for a festive look. A quaint gazebo offers a lovely focal point for a garden-inspired exchange of vows, and at the far end of the courtyard, the cascading waters accent the Waterfall Patio, which is surrounded on three sides by mature sycamores, oaks, and pines for a magically secluded feel.
  * **The delicious, locally-sourced cuisine beloved by regular diners will also be a treat to your guests.** Packages are scaleable and customizable, meaning you won't be facing surprise fees or limited options: all menus include a wide variety of fresh salad choices, beautiful plated entrées and seasonal sides, and a custom multi-tiered wedding cake, carefully crafted to match your desired design and flavors.
