## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This romantic mansion, built in the dramatic Greek Revival style** between the 18th and 19th centuries, is a living piece of history in the heart of Nashville. Now an elegant bed-and-breakfast, it offers sixteen beautifully furnished guest rooms that can sleep up to 40 of your loved ones for a relaxed wedding weekend experience (plus a delicious daily breakfast!).
  * **Set amid six acres of lushly manicured gardens and mature trees,** there are endless possibilities for your celebration: You might say “I do” amid the fragrant blooms in the Rose Garden Courtyard or between the columns on the front porch, then dine & dance beneath a peaked tent on the spacious lawn or the airy, modern Rosewood Hall (_opening May 2026!_).
  * **Small guest counts enjoy the same big benefits,** with options for in-house Southern-style catering and plenty of lovely, intimate gathering spaces: the Parlor’s handcarved fireplace is a lovely backdrop when the weather is chilly, or head to the garden for an al fresco celebration beneath the sunny skies.
