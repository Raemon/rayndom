## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This reinvented Bell Labs campus feels like a city-within-a-building,** with a sleek glass façade, soaring atriums, and expansive outdoor spaces that combine innovation and classic mid-century design. The iconic Atrium runs three football fields in length, with a massive photovoltaic sunroof overhead—the truly expansive climate-controlled space gives the breezy, open feel of outdoors in any weather.
  * **There's a setting for every kind of celebration, and every style,** from intimate gatherings to grand South Asian weddings. The Roof Deck is perfect in the summer months, with sweeping views of the surrounding greenery and lake and lounge-style furnishings that feel made for sipping on cocktails. In winter, the European-inspired Bar Bella Inverno + Lounge is a welcoming oasis, with sparkling twinkle lights overhead adding a romantic flair.
  * **Dramatic floor-to-ceiling windows in the Ballroom** showcase unobstructed vistas of the verdant landscaping and the sparkling waters of Zen Lake. Some couples choose to say "I do" on the sunny lakeside lawn before reconvening here, where customizable color and lighting schemes transform the space after sunset.
