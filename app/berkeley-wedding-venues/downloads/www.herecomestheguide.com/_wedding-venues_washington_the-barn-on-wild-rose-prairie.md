  * **The rural countryside of Eastern Washington delivers endlessly lovely vistas** at this family-operated property. Nestled less than an hour from Spokane, it boasts a beautifully restored barn with a distinctive rustic-modern design. 
  * **A manicured lawn with a pretty lattice-topped arbor** hosts your open-air ceremony, and the barn has everything needed for a stellar reception, including a wedding party dressing area and attached covered porch.
  * **Photo-ready décor and backdrops**(including a 1942 Ford flatbed truck and 1969 Camaro) can be added your package, which also includes helpful amenities like patio heaters and use of the fire pit.
