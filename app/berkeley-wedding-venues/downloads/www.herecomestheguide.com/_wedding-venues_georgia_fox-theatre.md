## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's one of America's most incredible movie palaces** —a 1929 Moroccan-inspired theatre that's hosted Elvis and the Rolling Stones, among countless others. 
  * **Exchange vows beneath the Auditorium's cobalt "sky"** , which is set with 96 glittering stars and magically drifting clouds. You can even hold your reception right on the stage!
  * **There are two magnificent ballrooms, too.** The Grand Salon is decked out in Moroccan tiles, mosaics, and antique stained glass, and has a beautiful rooftop Terrace. Or, choose the opulent Egyptian Ballroom, with its soaring columns and dramatic 30-foot coffered ceiling.
