## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **A breathtaking Rocky Mountain retreat, Beaver Creek Resort offers everything you need** for an intimate alpine destination wedding. This world-class, boutique hotel—just steps away from the ski slopes—has cozy fireplaces, a heated pool and hot tub, and luxurious guest rooms.
  * **The adorable Beaver Creek Chapel is the perfect place to exchange vows** , before adjourning to a full-service reception in the lodge overlooking the pines. Tables, chairs, flatware, and linens are included in their wedding packages, and the award-winning culinary team provides inventive and delectable menu choices.
  * **You can create a custom guest experience with a buyout of the hotel.** By reserving all 45 guest rooms and the 2 two-bedroom condos, you and your guests will have a wedding weekend that's not only exclusive but extra-memorable, too.
