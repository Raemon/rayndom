## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on the stunning grounds of the Cherokee Valley Golf Course,** this special venue is open to the public for private events, and treats guests to endless panoramas of the surrounding valleys and mountains. 
  * **The Southern-inspired architecture of the main venue sets it apart** from other clubhouses, with its charming window shutters, classically elegant interior, and gracious wraparound porch (rocking chairs included, of course!)
  * **If you’re imagining an entirely outdoor celebration, you’ve got it!** The Garden is meticulously landscaped, has a dedicated stage, and spans 8,500 square feet, so your ceremony, cocktails, and dancing can all happen surrounded by Cherokee Valley views.
