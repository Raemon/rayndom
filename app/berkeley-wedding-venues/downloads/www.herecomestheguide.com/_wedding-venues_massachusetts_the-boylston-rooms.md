## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Formerly a bustling textile mill,** this early-1800s treasure was actually disassembled brick by brick at the turn of the century to start a new life in Easthampton, at the edge of Lower Mill Pond. A recent renovation gave it yet another incarnation, this time as a cool, rustic-industrial event venue.
  * **The spaces are so beautiful—** opt for the light-filled Boylston Room East, with its century-old maple flooring, hardwood pillars, and exposed steel ceiling beams, or for the spacious Boylston Room West, where you'll find a floor of polished concrete and ample room for a dance floor. 
  * **There's outside space, too!** Host a ceremony on the banks of Lower Mill Pond, within view of Mt. Tom and the Holyoke Range. Then, celebrate your vows with cocktails in the Garden Courtyard.
