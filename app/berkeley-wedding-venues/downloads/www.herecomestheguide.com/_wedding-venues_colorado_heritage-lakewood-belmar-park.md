## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You won't believe all the celebration options available in one location**...and because this expansive venue is at the heart of pretty Belmar Park, you're surrounded by beautiful photo opportunities, too. 
  * **Say "I do" on the lawn of a historic schoolhouse or barn** , beneath a quaint gazebo, or on the steps of the grand, modern amphitheater with its graceful shade sails overhead. 
  * **Large receptions can be held on the stage of the amphitheater** , or outside on any of the park's open fields. Looking for something more intimate? Try the bright and airy Orchard Room, with its oversized windows overlooking the park.
