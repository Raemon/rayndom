## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s a luxurious private estate just outside Charlotte,** with a timeless Colonial-inspired mansion, large pond, and acres of lush lawns dotted with ancient trees. Be sure to allow lots of time for photos, as the entire property is one stunning backdrop. 
  * **Your entire affair can take place at the water’s edge,** thanks to a dedicated pond-side ceremony spot and gorgeous historic gazebo for hosting celebratory cocktails. Just steps away, there’s a lovely, climate-controlled reception hall that also overlooks the pond and grounds.
  * **There are two spacious dressing suites inside the mansion—** one upstairs and one down—so there’s ample space for the whole wedding party. The well-maintained gravel lot allows plenty of room for shuttle, limo, and ride-share parking…a fantastic convenience for guests who are staying over at one of the many nearby hotels.
