## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With an incredible waterfront location along the Gulf of Mexico,** this private Key Largo resort offers stellar sunsets, white sand beaches, and tranquil island vibes, thanks to lush grounds dotted with banyan and palm trees.
  * **Choose your favorite ceremony and reception spots—** all have dreamy ocean views and ample space to mingle, dine, and dance. Romantic bistro lighting is strung up throughout the trees, and there are fun, beachy touches throughout the property…we’re big fans of the 30 x 20-foot tiki hut!
  * **Rent the entire venue for a private wedding weekend,** with on-site accommodations for up to 36 guests in five charming cottages. Have a longer guest list? There are ample lodging options within walking distance, including resorts, inns, and vacation rentals.
