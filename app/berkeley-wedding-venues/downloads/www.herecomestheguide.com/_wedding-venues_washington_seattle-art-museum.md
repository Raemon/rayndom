## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located in the heart of downtown Seattle** , the art museum is close to the waterfront and Pike Place Market as well as many major hotels, making it a convenient destination for your guests. For an extra treat, you can even arrange a private gallery showing for them.
  * **The sleek, light-filled event spaces** offer a contemporary canvas for a sophisticated celebration. Suspended from the ceiling of the spacious Brotman Forum, John Grade’s large-scale sculpture _Middle Fork_ —which echoes the contours of a 140-year-old western hemlock—provides an especially memorable reception backdrop.
  * **Exclusive caterer Shooby Doo Catering at SAM specializes in locally grown food** and seasonal ingredients, crafting such delectable options as pan-seared wild Cape Cleare salmon, red-wine braised short ribs with a parsnip purée, and spiced pork tenderloin with a sweet celery root-apple relish.
