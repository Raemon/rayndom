  * **Its location is to die for.** Set at the end of a promontory that juts out into Kapalua Bay, this restaurant is surrounded by turquoise water and has a front row seat to spectacular sunsets.
  * **Considered the “Home of Hawaiian Regional Cuisine”** , Merriman’s farm-to-table menu is 90% locally sourced, showcasing the island’s freshest fish, seafood, meat and produce.
  * **All weddings are managed by a professional team** experienced in eliminating the stress of planning from afar. Your personal event manager will even be on site the day of your wedding to ensure that things run smoothly from start to finish.
