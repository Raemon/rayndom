## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This artfully restored 1941 dance hall** boasts historic dramatic architecture, innovative, industrial-meets-European design, and is surrounded by acres of beautifully landscaped grounds, ensuring a range of spectacular photo backdrops. 
  * **The Belvedere is your pretty outdoor ceremony space—** it’s covered so you and your guests will be sheltered from any uncooperative weather. In the main hall, you’ll find endless striking details, including a 25-foot exposed beam ceiling, stunning Art Deco-inspired bar, and an original brick fireplace. 
  * **An elevator ferries guests to the cool mezzanine level** , which overlooks the main floor and boasts a bar and fireplace of its own. There’s also a beautiful, light-filled atrium on the ground floor, with wraparound windows and rows of skylights—a lovely alternative spot for your ceremony and cocktail hour.
