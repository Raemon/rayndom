## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The 1904 Queen Anne-style home at the heart of this beautiful ten-acre property** stands as a testament to Oklahoma’s territory and homesteading origins. Now serving as a living museum, it offers guests the opportunity to step back in time for a taste of the state’s early history and heritage. 
  * **A quaint Victorian gazebo set amid shade trees** creates a lovely spot for vows, while sprawling lawns allow ample space for cocktails and games. The stunning stone and cedar barn is climate-controlled for celebrations in all seasons, and event tents are welcome if you’re planning an extra-grand affair. 
  * **Rental rates are wonderfully affordable,** and the space also available for micro-weddings, elopements, engagement parties, and more. All fees help support the upkeep of the museum grounds and buildings and its educational programs.
