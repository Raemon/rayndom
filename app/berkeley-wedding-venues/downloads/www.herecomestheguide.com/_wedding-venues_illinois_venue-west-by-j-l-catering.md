## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With a great West Town location and cool, vintage-urban vibe,** this loft-style event space offers loads of flexibility, with customizable floor plans and coordination assistance from a fun, dedicated staff.
  * **Sandy-hued brick walls are accented by weathered wood and metal,** and the ceilings, with their exposed rafters and ductwork, add to the industrial-chic feel. A top-notch integrated lighting and A/V system lets you easily set the mood for each phase of your celebration. 
  * **Set up your lounge area with couches, sectionals, and highboy tables—** Venue West has a huge collection of custom furnishings available in-house, so there’s no need to deal with a separate vendor.
