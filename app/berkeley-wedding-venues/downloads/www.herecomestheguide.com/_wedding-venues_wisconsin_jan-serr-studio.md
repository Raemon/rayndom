## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked away in UWM’s Kenilworth Square East building (and right in the heart of Milwaukee’s historic East Side)** , this loft-style destination is actually two venues in one: a cool downstairs gallery, and a top-floor studio with a towering wall of windows and covered balcony that offer dazzling skyline views.
  * **Striking contemporary-industrial touches** like glossy concrete flooring and exposed ceiling ductwork bring architectural pizzazz…while a deep, moody palette, glittering chandeliers, and strings of café lights keep the space warm and romantic. 
  *  _**Saz’s Catering**_**is your stellar exclusive dining team,** and they pride themselves on creative, custom menus. Bonus alert!: Whether you opt for plated, buffet, stations, or family-style, they’re one of the most affordable full-service catering providers in the area.
