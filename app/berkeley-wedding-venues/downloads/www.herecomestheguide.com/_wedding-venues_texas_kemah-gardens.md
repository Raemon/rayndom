## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled on four beautiful acres,** this ultra-private venue and B&B offers a pastoral, peaceful vibe, but is an easy drive from both Houston and Galveston. Exchange vows beneath a handmade vintage arbor at the water's edge followed by a reception in the climate-controlled, open-sided wooden pavilion. Tell your photographer to be on the lookout: the grounds are frequently visited by blue herons, egrets, red hawks...there's even a family of turtles living in the pond! 
  * **Check out our Hill Country destination venue:[Log Cabins at Jacobs Creek](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/texas/log-cabins-at-jacobs-creek)**  

  * **They offer a broad range of helpful packages—** all-inclusive affairs, ceremony only, DIY, simple elopements, and more—and every option includes the assistance of Kemah Garden's caring, experienced event staff.
