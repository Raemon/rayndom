# 8 Ways To Include Mom In Your Wedding Day

## Give that woman some recognition!

Whether it's your biological mom, a stepmom, grandmother, or strong female mentor, the fact remains: she helped shape you into the person you are today. Your wedding is _kind of a big deal_ to her, so why not show her just how much she means to you by treating her like a queen on the big day? Here are some ways to include your mother figure in your wedding:

## From MOB to MOH

If you consider your mom to be your best friend, why not give her that special place by your side? No reason to leave her weeping in the front row when she can take center stage, hold your bouquet...and, okay, maybe weep a little in front of the crowd. Be sure to ask her in a special way: We like the idea of gifting her with a beautiful silk hankie that says, "To dry your eyes while you stand by my side."

  


## GRWM: Mother-of-the-Bride Edition

Although technically she may not be part of your wedding party, why not invite your mom to hang out with your squad before the ceremony? Treat her like the queen that she is by including her in the pre-wedding fun. Pay for her to get her hair and makeup professionally done, and don't forget the free-flowing mimosas!

## Raid Her Closet

Even if you don't go so far as to wear mom's old wedding dress, you can still incorporate some elements of hers into your bridal look. Sew a patch of her wedding gown fabric into the underside of your dress, wear her emerald earrings, or place her beloved brooch in your bouquet. Bonus: This can also be your "Something Borrowed". If she's no longer living, wear a locket with her picture inside and keep her close to your heart.

  


## Schedule Some "Mom & Me Time"

Once the two of you are dressed and beautified, set aside a few minutes pre-ceremony for JUST you and your mom to spend together. The reason you'll want to be camera-ready? This is the perfect time to get some sweet candids of you and your mama before you officially become a Mrs.

  


## Take A Walk Together

This isn't just a job for dads! Embrace the girl power and honor your mother by asking her to walk you down the aisle. We especially love this idea for strong, single mothers who took on the role of both mom _and_ dad when you were young.

## Have Her Speak At Your Ceremony

You don't want to make your mom work _too_ hard on your wedding day, but an easy way for her to get involved is by asking her to speak during the ceremony. Whether it's a meaningful poem, a scripture, or an excerpt from a book she used to read to you as a kid, it's a heartfelt—and relatively stress-free—way to include her.

  


## Make Her Cry

In a good way! Write your mom a sincere, handwritten note for her to read before the day begins. Or make a toast to your mom at the reception. After all she's done to raise you right, she deserves a shout-out!

  


## Honor Her Memory

If your mom can't be physically present on your wedding day, she will definitely be there in spirit. So set aside a place at your reception or reserve a front-row seat at the ceremony for her. Place a beautiful framed photo, a lovely floral arrangement, and perhaps a glowing candle to honor her memory and symbolize her presence.
