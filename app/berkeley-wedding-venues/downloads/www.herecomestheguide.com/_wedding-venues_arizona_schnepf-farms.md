## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A peach orchard and acres of gardens****that produce bountiful fruits,** veggies, and herbs year-round are the hallmarks of this peaceful, family-run farm on the outskirts of Queen Creek—just under an hour from Phoenix. 
  * **Opt for an all-outdoors affair in the tree-lined meadow,** or under an arbor beside the mid-century Farmhouse, with a reception in its grand ballroom. Or, celebrate in the Big Red Barn, with its cool, rustic-industrial design.
  * **A collection of nine adorable vintage trailers,** collectively called The Cozy Peach, are available for overnight stays. Each with its own charming character, they’re a wonderful option for extending your weekend.
