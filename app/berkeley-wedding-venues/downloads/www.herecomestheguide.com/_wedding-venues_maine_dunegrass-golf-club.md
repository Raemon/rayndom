## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This attractive Southern Maine golf club is immaculately landscaped,** and surrounded by mature woodlands. Its location, just a few minutes from the white sands of Old Orchard Beach, means you'll have plenty of cool settings for additional photos, and ample lodging choices, too.
  * **The Back Lawn’s elegant white arbor****shelters your outdoor vows,** and its adjacent patio offers an al fresco spot for cocktails. The Grand Cypress Ballroom is airy and light-filled, with dozens of large windows and a huge permanent dance floor. 
  * **For inviting intimate celebrations, consider the coastal vibes** of the window-walled Azalea Room, or the contemporary, relaxed Augusta Room, which is outfitted with a state-of-the-art golf simulation system.
