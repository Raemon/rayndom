## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This grand Georgian mansion, nestled on expansive historic estate in Leesburg,** showcases the region’s exquisite natural beauty, with a sweeping front lawn perfect for pastoral “I do”s, a tucked-away garden begging for post-nuptial photos, and panoramic views of rolling hills and lush forest from every stunning corner of the property.
  * **Lined with walls of windows that span from the floor to the double-height ceilings,** the Conservatory Ballroom is flooded with natural light that gleams on the hardwood floors and shimmers of the chandeliers. An adjacent stone patio is a welcoming site for cocktails, with a pretty pergola on one side backed by vistas that span miles towards the horizon.
  * **All-inclusive packages are carefully curated by the experts at The Manors VA,** with the flexibility to use your own vendors or enjoy the delectable, custom-crafted menus of the in-house caterer, Gala Cuisine. There’s even a place on-site for the wedding party to stay: the Thomson Farmhouse, built in 1760 and beautifully renovated to sleep 14 guests with comfort and ease.
