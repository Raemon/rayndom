## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Though it’s just 30 minutes from downtown Austin,** this Hill Country spot offers a peaceful retreat from the cities and suburbs, with acres of tranquil grounds and easy access to Lake Travis and other local favorites.
  * **Ceremonies and outdoor celebrations take place in the dreamy Courtyard and Gardens,** which boast over 2,000 species of native plants. Beautifully lit in the evening, the areas invite guests to sit and relax on porch swings, rockers, and benches crafted from local cedar.
  * **A path leads revelers through a wildflower field** from the Courtyard to Horseshoe Meadow, where they’ll discover a sophisticated, rustic-chic space that features a hay bale bar, a gravel dance space, gorgeous string lights, our vendor room, and a spacious lawn with plenty of room for dining under the big Texas sky.
