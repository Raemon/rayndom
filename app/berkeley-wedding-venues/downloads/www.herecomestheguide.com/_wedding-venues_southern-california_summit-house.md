## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched on one of the highest points in North Orange County** and encircled by 12 acres of Fullerton's Vista Park, celebrations at this iconic spot are blessed by spectacular panoramas: To the north loom the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains; to the east are the Santa Anas; to the south and west are the Laguna Hills and the sparkling Pacific. At night, it feels like you are floating atop a sea of stars.
  * **Built in the tradition of an English country manor, the House is truly romantic,** boasting classic Old World details like coffered ceilings, pewter chandeliers, and enormous bay windows for soaking in the views. Just outside, lush sycamores shade the manicured lawns and rose gardens create a fragrant surrounding for ceremonies in the wedding gazebo.
  * **Their all-inclusive packages provide just about everything—** BYO the rings and leave the rest to the experts. Crafted specifically to take the pressure off planning and pulling off a grand event, the inclusions are truly generous: expect perks like wedding photography, DJ services, lush florals, and, of course, delectable in-house catering that will astound your foodie guests.
