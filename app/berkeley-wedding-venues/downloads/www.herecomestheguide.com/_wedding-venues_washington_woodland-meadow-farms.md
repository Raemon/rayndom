## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **For a woodsy summer wedding with a casual backyard feel** , this 50-acre farm in the Snohomish Valley offers a picture-perfect backdrop of flower-filled meadows; fields of hops, squash, berries, and fruit; and gorgeous rows of trees.
  * **The charming amphitheatre with a wooden pergola** and steps leading to the altar provides a lovely outdoor ceremony location. Pine trees surround the space, which is beautifully landscaped with rocks, ferns, and splashes of floral color.
  * **A large fire pit edged with Adirondack chairs lends some warmth** and sparkle to evening festivities. Also included with each celebration are folding chairs, farm tables, and a spacious white reception tent with drapes and chandeliers.
