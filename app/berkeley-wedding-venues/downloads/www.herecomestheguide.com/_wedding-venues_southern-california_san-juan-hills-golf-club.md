## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its welcoming, Early California style, this** **hacienda-influenced clubhouse** has the easy flow of a structure designed for indoor/outdoor gatherings. Whatever the function and wherever you decide to host it, the San Juan Hills staff will make sure everything runs smoothly, seeing to everyone’s needs and serving up the mouthwatering hors d’oeuvres and entrées for which the club is well known.
  * **Framed by fragrant lavender, rosemary, and colorful roses** and boasting lovely views of the 18th hole and the surrounding San Juan Hills, the Green View Veranda**** is a favorite for al fresco celebrations. It's especially lovely when paired with the club's adjacent banquet space, where the vaulted, open-beamed ceiling, dark walnut accents and Tuscan-style chandeliers give it a warm Mediterranean feel.
  * **The first tee, overlooking the club’s lake and waterfall, is both picturesque and musical** —a lovely setting for saying "I do". It’s a natural choice for photos, too, though picture-perfect backdrops abound on the beautifully landscaped grounds. third ceremony option, the Greenside Patio, is nestled between the Veranda and the rolling greens.
