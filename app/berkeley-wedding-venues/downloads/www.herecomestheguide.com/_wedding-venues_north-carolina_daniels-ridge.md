## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Just a quick drive from Raleigh and its suburbs,** this peaceful, pastoral spot offers an array of beautiful outdoor ceremony spaces, all with views of the lush woodlands and distant hills.
  * **The barn-style reception hall is gorgeous,** with a stained plank cathedral ceiling, shiplap walls, and a covered patio perfect for an al fresco cocktail hour or overflow seating.
  * **Your package comes with loads of lovely and useful extras,** like vintage furniture, rustic-chic decor touches on the windowsills, and access to the well-appointed dressing suites for the couple.
