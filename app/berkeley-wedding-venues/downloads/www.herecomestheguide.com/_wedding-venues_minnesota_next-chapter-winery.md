## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Fantastic photo ops, great wine, unique spaces to gather—** you’ll find the perfect combo of all three in this special family-owned winery that’s nestled just a short distance south of Minneapolis. 
  * **Wed in the lush Vineyard Atrium,** followed by cocktails in the rustic-chic Barrel Room. When it’s reception time, the Next Chapter Pavilion is ready to host beautiful covered celebrations within view of the winery’s pretty grounds. 
  * **You can choose your favorite vendors and bring your own décor** (even candles!), and you’ll have the support of their awesome events team, who truly care about making your day the best day ever.
