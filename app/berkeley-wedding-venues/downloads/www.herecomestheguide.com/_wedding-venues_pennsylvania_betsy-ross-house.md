## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nearly 300 years of history:** This Old City landmark celebrating the birthplace of the American flag was once home to Betsy Ross. The original Colonial house still stands as a museum, and site rentals support its preservation and education efforts.
  * **The charming cobblestone courtyard provides a memorable open-air setting** for an intimate ceremony, cocktail reception, or banquet. Café-style tables and chairs are available, and the tentable space features vintage street lamp lighting.
  * **Arrange a visit from Betsy Ross herself or other major colonial figures** with the Once Upon A Nation History Makers. These reenactors have thoroughly researched the people they're portraying and can mingle with your guests or even officiate or emcee your event.
