##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **This beautiful stone Tudor building, surrounded by a lush golf course, is just minutes from several historic towns.** The lovely drive through nearby Chestnut Hill, Lafayette Hill and Plymouth Meeting adds to the anticipation of your event.
  * **A landscaped path leads to the romantic ceremony site, complete with breathtaking natural backdrop.** After your vows, take a golf cart to several picture-perfect settings, including the sparkling pond and fountain ringed by dramatic weeping willows.
  * **French doors, exposed stone and a cozy fireplace enhance the charms of this venue.** The luxurious Ballroom boasts floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the adjacent Veranda, where you can enjoy cocktails and sweeping views of the manicured fairways.
