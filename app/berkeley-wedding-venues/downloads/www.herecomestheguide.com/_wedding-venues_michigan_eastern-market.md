## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With buildings dating back to the late 1800s,** this historic collection of warehouse-style spaces is one of Detriot’s most beloved public institutions. 
  * **Choose between three generously sized “sheds”,** each with its own vintage charm. All boast soaring ceilings, tons of natural light, and the optional addition of outdoor plaza areas and catering kitchens. 
  * **Your rental fees help benefit Eastern Market Partnership,** who have been serving the Detroit area for over 125 years. Funds raised from events go directly toward their mission to make fresh food more accessible to the city’s residents.
