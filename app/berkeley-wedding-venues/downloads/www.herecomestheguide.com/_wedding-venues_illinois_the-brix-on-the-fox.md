## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked alongside the picturesque Fox River, this 1880s-era building** began life as a condensed milk factory. Now, it has been expertly restored and outfitted to host unforgettable events in two lavish spaces, each offering gorgeous water views and easy access to the shoreline for unforgettable photos.
  * **The grand Two-Sixty venue impresses with original 19th-century details,** like vintage brick walls and ceilings crossed with wooden trusses. The airy, light-filled hall invites creativity: keep things simple and use the dramatic downlights to accent the architecture, or opt for something more elaborate, like bursts of florals, gauzy drapery, or even a fog machine!
  * **While a bit more intimate, the Industria venue still retains a bright, industrial feel**. Here, an enormous built-in brick arch makes for a dramatic entrance into your ceremony, and provides a pretty divider to encourage an easy flow from the "I do"s to the toasts.
