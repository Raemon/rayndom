## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This Tudor-inspired Corona del Mar landmark, modeled off England's oldest country inn** , has been an icon of elegance, award-winning cuisine, and hospitality since its opening in 1965. Known for serving up some of the best prime rib in town, as well as contemporary renditions of fresh seafood, roasted fowl, and succulent lamb, Five Crowns has hosted legions of discriminating local diners and illustrious guests. 
  * **A traditional white pergola is the centerpiece of the spacious patio,** backed by a romantic ivy-draped wall and surrounded by soft lawns and fragrant blooms.**** After vows are exchanged, guests are welcome to mingle in the gardens and adjacent greenhouse, a stunning glass-walled space that is flooded with warm SoCal sunshine by day and illuminated with glowing lanterns and candles at night.
  * **The intimate private dining rooms offer ample vintage charm:** options include the the sophisticated Crown/Nelson Room, with its plush leather furnishings, dark wood beams, and antique nautical adornments, and the lovely Brighton Room, named for George IV's 1782 pleasure palace and outfitted with two warm fireplaces.
