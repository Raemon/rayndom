## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Pairing spectacular views with delectable cuisine and excellent service, this popular restaurant** offers a spectacular setting for a destination wedding set amid breathtaking pastoral beauty. Every bite of the delicious in-house catering is as exquisite as the surroundings, highlighting fresh, organic produce and meats, a curated wine list, and craft cocktails.
  * **The Lodge, designed with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking towering pines** and the rugged mountain golf course, highlights the glories of the natural world in a classic Tahoe-style ambiance. The Sage and Aspen Rooms on the second floor are ideal for a rehearsal or welcome dinner, while the cozy pub seems made for afterparties.
  * **Spring through fall, the picturesque Grotto is a lovely setting for al fresco ceremonies** overlooking the wooded mountains. Complete with a waterfall, the grassy enclave also provides some lovely photo opportunities. In winter, the Lodge's huge pictures windows frame a magical wonderland, overlooking panoramic landscapes where the mountains wear a dusting of snow.
