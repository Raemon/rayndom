# Small Wedding Details that are High on Style

## Micro Wedding, Mega Flair.

**There's no reason to skimp on style just because you're having a small or micro wedding**. It's all in the details, right? And oftentimes having a wedding on a smaller scale enables you to splurge a bit! We've rounded up 13 of the most stylish and stunning small wedding details we've seen.

## Vow Books

Vow books are an inexpensive yet sentimental detail to include in your intimate nuptials. And the bonus is that they look beautiful in photos.

## Personalized Place Settings

When you're hosting just a handful of guests, you can get super personalized with things like handwritten place cards and expertly-folded napkins.

## Bodacious Bouquet

Your bouquet is a fun and photo-worthy place to splurge and show off your style. Just because your wedding is small doesn't mean your bouquet has to be!

## Attire + Accessories

Micro wedding. But make it fashion.

## Sensational Signage

Another Instagrammable small wedding detail that's big on style is signage! Whether it's a gorgeous acrylic "signature cocktail" menu or a retro neon sign, they're a fabulous way to decorate a wedding of any size.

## Ceremony Backdrop

If there's one piece of décor worth splurging on, it's your ceremony backdrop or arch. If possible, you can repurpose it for your reception, too! #doubleduty

## Luxurious Tablescape

If your wedding is small enough to necessitate just one table, go all out with it. Get gorgeous chairs, luxe linens, glowing candles, and stunning floral arrangements.

## Themed Details

When your wedding is on a smaller scale, it becomes easier to weave in custom details to create an overarching theme. For example, a travel theme can be achieved through an aviation-inspired venue, international cuisine, passport-inspired paper goods, a globe "guest book", and luggage tag favors!

## Creative Catering

The sky's the limit when it comes to your microwedding menu! Host a glorious high-end dinner party with multiple courses, keep the "small" theme going with a tasting menu or tapas, or go casual with a fun food truck or bubble bar!

## Cutting Cake

If a traditional wedding cake is just too much for your micro guest count, get an adorably sweet cutting cake for just the two of you. Guests can enjoy accompanying cupcakes, donuts, or other treats!

## Plated Desserts

Individually-plated desserts garnished with a delicate herb garnish will delight each guest—and end the soirée on a sweet note!

## Outdoor Lounge Area

They're popular for weddings of all sizes, but chic lounge areas are especially welcome for micro-wedding, as they encourage convivial mingling between guests. Plus, they're super photogenic!

## Custom Favors

When you're having a 150-person wedding, the favors can really add up! But when your wedding is intimate, you can spend a bit more on a really special wedding favor. Think mini champagne bottles, potted succulents, or even have a tattoo artist on hand to gift your guests some custom ink!

## A Proper "Send Off"

Why not end your micro wedding with a bang? We love the idea of a standout send-off, like releasing sky lanterns, setting off colorful smoke bombs, or lighting up the sky with fireworks!
