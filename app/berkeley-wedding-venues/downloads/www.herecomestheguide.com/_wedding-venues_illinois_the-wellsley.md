## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This River North stunner is a true Art Deco masterpiece** , thoughtfully restored by nationally regarded design team AvroKO. You might begin with a cozy welcome party in the speakeasy-inspired second floor lounge, mingling on the plush velvet couches with your nearest and dearest.
  * **For the big event, the Main Hall is a stunning pick,** thanks to inlaid wood floors, custom chandeliers, and a gorgeous hand-painted skylight. The adjacent Atrium is outfitted with terrazzo floors, dramatic black-mirrored ceilings, and a jade bar perfect for serving craft libations.
  * **Their partnership with James Beard Award-winning Boka Restaurant Group** ensures every bite is a delight. Their Michelin-starred culinary team handles everything from customized menus to a full beverage program, making this a truly luxurious all-inclusive experience.
