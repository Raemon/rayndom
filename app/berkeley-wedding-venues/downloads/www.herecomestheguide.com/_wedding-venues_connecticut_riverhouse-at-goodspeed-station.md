## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled on a ridge above the Connecticut River, this state-of-the-art event center** overlooks the historic East Haddam Swing Bridge and Goodspeed Opera House. Hosting only one wedding at a time ensures you’ll receive plenty of personalized service.
  * **The Ceremonial Patio and Terrace features a knockout, pavilion-sized gazebo.** Views of the river, pier and bridge make a great backdrop for photos, as does the fabulous central staircase in the main lobby… perfect for group shots.
  * **Your indoor reception areas are filled with light.** From the lovely lobby atrium, a sweet spot for cocktails, to the large Ballroom, which boasts a high-ceiling, Palladian windows and impressive chandeliers, there’s an open, airy feel to the surroundings.
