## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Once a meeting hall for local laborers, this historic building** was rescued and renovated by two sisters-in-law with a dream of providing a special space that would serve as both a memory-making destination and hub of activity for the charming community of Moosup. 
  * **The Perfect Room spans the main floor;** it’s an airy, light-filled space with a stage, wood flooring, and a three-tiered crystal chandelier. Downstairs is the more intimate, rustic-elegant Bella Room…rent the floors separately, or combine them for grand events. 
  * **Rental options are generous, flexible, and affordable—** choose a preferred caterer, seek out another local favorite, or bring in your own food and beverage. The caring team here encourages couples to infuse celebrations with elements of their unique families and cultures.
