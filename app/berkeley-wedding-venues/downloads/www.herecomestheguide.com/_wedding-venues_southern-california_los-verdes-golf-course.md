## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This private event venue is nestled in picturesque Palos Verdes,** a coastal enclave described by 1913 banker Frank Vanderlip as a "fashionable and exclusive residential colony." If you fantasize about a wedding with the ocean as your backdrop but are daunted by sky-high prices, you'll find plenty of options here—the scenic vistas stretch from Malibu to Catalina Island.
  * **A pair of wrought-iron gates open onto the striking Catalina Terrace,** where you can exchange vows against a sweeping view of rolling fairways dotted with blossoms and evergreens, and the azure Pacific beyond. In fact, every ceremony site on the property shares the same captivating panorama of tranquil ocean, soaring seabirds, and graceful sailboats.
  * **After al fresco hors d'oeuvres under the shade of the Terrace's awning,** guests flow into the Vista Ballroom, where two walls of floor-to-ceiling windows keep that gorgeous view at hand. Their award-winning culinary team are experts at crafting personalized menus, ranging from delectable, casual fare to grand five-course receptions.
