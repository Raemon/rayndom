## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Modeled after the famous riverboats of Europe,** this custom-built cruiser was designed specifically for Tampa, offering a unique culinary and cocktail experience along the Hillsborough River. Owing to its ultra-low profile, your captain is able to navigate beneath the city’s many picturesque bridges. 
  * **The bow of the ship sets a romantic scene for vows.** Once you’ve said “I do”, the cruise continues as the party moves inside, to the chic, window-walled interior. Our favorite feature: signature cocktails served from the “boat on a boat” bar, crafted from a 1914 wood cruiser. 
  * **Packages can be completely tailored to fit your vision,** and give you the option of renting out the entire vessel, or simply one designated space for an ultra-intimate gathering. The boat is available for hosting rehearsal dinners and bachelor/bachelorette parties, too.
