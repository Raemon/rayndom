  * **On the lovely 18th green, towering date palms encircle a sparkling lake** fed by fountains and a waterfall flowing over rocky outcroppings. As you say your vows, cattails lean into the balmy breeze and seasonal flowers provide splashes of color, while the surrounding Santa Rosa foothills look on.
  * **The striking clubhouse offers a contemporary version of Southwest style,** incorporating wood, glass and stone in an angular design. Toast your nuptials in the in the Main Lounge, a split-level area with a crescent-shaped bar, and follow with a reception in the Main Dining Room, a sunken banquet space with lofty windows overlooking manicured fairways.
