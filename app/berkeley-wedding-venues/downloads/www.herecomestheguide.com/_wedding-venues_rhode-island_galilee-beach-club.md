## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched at the southernmost tip of Narragansett,** this beautiful coastal venue offers sweeping views the Atlantic Ocean and Block Island and a relaxed, family-friendly vibe.
  * **Nestled on 250 feet of sandy beachfront,** this is the only spot in the area where you can say "I do" on the shore in total privacy. After exchanging vows, sip cocktails on the deck watching the sun set over the sea, or cozy up to a warm fire-pit right on the sand.
  * **Dine and dance in the historic clubhouse's oceanfront dining room,** where expansive windows frame vistas of sailboats gracefully passing through the Sound. Here, you'll enjoy the assistance of the Club's expert planners and the fresh, artfully prepared menus of their exceptional chefs.
