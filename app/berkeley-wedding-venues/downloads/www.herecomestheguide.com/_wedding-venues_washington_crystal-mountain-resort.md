##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **With the majesty of Mt. Rainier and the Cascade Range as your backdrop** , your ceremony at the summit will be truly breathtaking. Plus, the scenic ride up the mountain on the Mt. Rainier Gondola is a truly one-of-a-kind treat for you and your guests!
  * **Dine & dance at the Summit House, the state's highest elevation restaurant, **or opt for Rafters, with its vaulted ceilings and skylights, heavy timber beams, and**** antique ski décor. The resort's largest venue, Mountain Commons, boasts a stylish, modern design and a fabulous patio that affords a wonderful indoor/outdoor flow.
  * **Luxurious guest rooms, chalets, and a honeymoon suite are available** in the nearby hotels, most of which are just a short walk from the venue.
