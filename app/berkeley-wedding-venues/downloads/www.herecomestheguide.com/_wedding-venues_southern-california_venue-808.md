## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set in the heart of East Village, this impressive, one-of-a-kind spot** isn't your ordinary warehouse venue. In addition to the classic soaring, open-beamed ceilings and massive multi-paned windows, you'll find mature, light-draped olive trees, a cobblestone-style aisle, and cool contemporary lanterns throughout.
  * **Modern industrial architecture complements elegant, light-flooded event spaces,** which include the expansive main space and its adjacent sunken lounge, a contemporary, wood-built Farmhouse Chapel, and two stylishly furnished get-ready suites.
  * **You'll enjoy fabulous dining options and legendary service** thanks to the topnotch team at _Social Tap Catering._ They work closely with every couple to develop a fully customized food and beverage package, from signature drinks and grazing boards to dessert bars and the perfect late night snack.
