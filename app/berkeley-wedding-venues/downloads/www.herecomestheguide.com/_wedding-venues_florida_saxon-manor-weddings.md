## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set among acres of lush, manicured lawns and Spanish moss-draped oaks,** this inviting family-owned spot is truly lovely. Start with a ceremony on the grounds of the dreamy Victorian mansion, or say "I do" in the ample gardens. Then, move to the open-air patio for cocktails.
  * **The Barn is absolutely picture-perfect:** It boasts traditional red siding and sliding doors at either end, and an interior featuring whitewashed walls and open rafters adorned with glittering chandeliers. The climate-controlled Garden Room is another lovely option—the gossamer-draped ceilings and wraparound windows bring the outside in.
  * **You'll have a blast getting ready in the adorable Bridal Cottage.** It's got a dressing room, living room, hair and makeup area, and dining area—plenty of space to spread out for even the largest wedding parties.
