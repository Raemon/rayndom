## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This tranquil bed & breakfast** **sets a romantic country scene** near Historic Main Street La Grange and within easy reach of Louisville, surrounded by lush pastures, thoroughbred horse farms, and rolling hills.
  * **Al fresco celebrations are lovely on the verdant lawn,** accompanied by the soft sounds of nature and the occasional whinnying of nearby horses. More intimate gatherings might be held before the fireplace, or in the Speakeasy lounge, or vintage 1920s Theater, providing lots of flexibility for the flow of your day.
  * **Their on-site lodging** **makes a wedding weekend simple,** with luxury suites as well as apartment-style options, with the ability to reserve the whole inn for privacy. Our favorite inviting perks include fire pits, a jacuzzi, and outdoor games, which encourage your loved ones to mingle and relax.
