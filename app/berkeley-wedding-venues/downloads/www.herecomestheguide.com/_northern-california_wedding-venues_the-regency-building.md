## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Completed in 1909 as a Scottish Rite Temple, this Beaux Arts treasure** housed a movie theater for many years, and now it has a new lease on life as a fabulous event site in the heart of hip Nob Hill. Three separate venues, each with distinctive architectural characteristics and an array of accompanying rooms, offer plenty of versatility to customize your spectacular celebration.
  * **The most impressive space is the Lodge, which imparts a dramatic Gothic splendor.** Here, a 35-foot-high ceiling is traversed by arched, dark wood beams, and 31 exquisite hand-painted Hollywood backdrops enhance the built-in stage. Nearby, the intimate Regency Room is distinguished by carved nature motifs, breathtaking hand-embroidered silk tapestries, and a cozy working fireplace.
  * **A marble staircase leads to the Regency Ballroom, a shining example of turn-of-the-century craftsmanship.** The moldings and wainscoting are all covered in elaborate neoclassical plasterwork, while 22 teardrop chandeliers hang from the carved, beamed ceiling. On the lower level, the Social Hall exudes modern sophistication, with blonde hardwood floors that gleam in the light cast from a series of frosted glass-and-brass fixtures.
