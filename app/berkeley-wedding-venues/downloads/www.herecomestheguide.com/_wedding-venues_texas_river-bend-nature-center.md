## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You can host an unforgettable wedding surrounded by stunning flora** without blowing your budget. In fact, it's hard to beat the lush woodland setting of the new Forest Ceremony Site in the heart of this nature center's 15 acres.
  * **Overlooking the property, their 7,000-square-foot Pavilion** features a cathedral ceiling, brick wall, and and breathtaking views through two open sides. This very popular venue offers amenities like free WiFi, private restrooms, and wind guards.
  * **Another option is the J.S. Bridwell Terrace, a spacious uncovered area** planted with native vegetation. And the North Library in the main building can be used for getting ready, relaxing, and taking photos.
