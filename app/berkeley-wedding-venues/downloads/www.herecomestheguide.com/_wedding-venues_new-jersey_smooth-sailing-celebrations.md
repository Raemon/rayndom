## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **What could be more romantic than celebrating your wedding day on the water?** Imagine floating in style down the Hudson River at sunset, taking in the dazzling New York City skyline. You can even have your ceremony performed by a nautical celebrant or a captain!
  * **The yachts are fabulous.** With over 45 to choose from that hold 12 to 1,200 guests, you’ll be sure to find the one that best suits your needs. The sleek _Royal Princess_ and _Aqua Azul_ are perfect for the sophisticated couple, while the _Festiva_ is the Hudson’s only convertible yacht, allowing guests to dance under the stars. The _Majesty_ is simply majestic and the largest party boat in the United States! They also offer smaller luxury yachts, catamarans, sailboats and schooners for more intimate events.
  * **You’ll have smooth event sailing from start to finish.** Your personal cruise consultant can help you with everything from photography and entertainment to florists and favors, and executive chefs will create first-class cuisine for your reception with food prepared fresh onboard right before the event takes place. Plus you can relax, knowing that the professionally trained (and uniformed!) Captain and marine crew, Maitre’d, bartenders and service staff are there to make your day flow seamlessly.
