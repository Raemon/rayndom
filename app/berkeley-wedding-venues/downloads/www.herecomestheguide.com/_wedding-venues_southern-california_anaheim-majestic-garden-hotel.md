## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Just minutes from Disneyland, this Tudor-style landmark is both impressive in design and convenient in location.** Near airports and attractions in both Los Angeles and Orange counties, and with the largest guest rooms in town, it's carefully designed for your guests' comfort. And just so no one’s bored after your big event, the hotel offers complimentary transportation and a concierge desk to assist with planning outings to neighboring Disneyland Resort.
  * **Couples often say "I do"s in the manicured Pond Courtyard,** a peaceful enclave enclosed by the quaint façades of the hotel's stone- and brick-turreted buildings. Nearby, you'll find a lovely spot for photos: a picturesque outdoor koi pond surrounded by giant ferns, with a bubbling waterfall as a focal point. Another intimate option is the Rose Garden, where nuptials are held beneath a rustic archway entwined with rose vines and festooned with fragrant blooms.
  * **All of the reception rooms exude Old World elegance,** accented with cream-colored damask stripes, crown molding, domeshaped chandeliers and wall sconces. No matter which area you select, you can count on fine cuisine and flawless service overseen by the Banquet Director and Executive Chef, who’ve been with the hotel for more than 40 years combined.
