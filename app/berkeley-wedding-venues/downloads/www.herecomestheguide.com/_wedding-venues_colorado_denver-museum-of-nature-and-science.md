## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's a beloved Denver institution with serious science street cred and jaw-dropping rooftop views that make you fall in love with Colorado all over again.** We especially love the stunning Anschutz Family Sky Terrace with its modern shade sails and sleek glass railings, where ceremonies unfold against panoramic vistas of downtown Denver's skyline and the Front Range mountains.
  * **The impressive interior can host up to 350 guests but still feels intimate and special, with design touches like soaring ceilings and natural light that will surround your celebration.** Our favorite feature: You're literally partying among dinosaurs, world-class displays, and private planetarium shows. Plus, the gorgeous rose gardens in City Park create the most romantic backdrop for photos.
  * **Multiple distinctive spaces flow seamlessly together for your wedding day,** with spacious atriums perfect for cocktail hour and the sophisticated Spratlen Lounge for more intimate gatherings. And their in-house culinary team creates exceptional menus that perfectly complement your celebration.
