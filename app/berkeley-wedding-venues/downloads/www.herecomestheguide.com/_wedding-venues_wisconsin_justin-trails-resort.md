## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s a very special eco-luxury resort in the southwest Wisconsin countryside,** whose elevated, 200-acre location provides unobstructed 360-degree views of endless fields and forests. A third-generation farm homestead, it’s family and dog-friendly, with a focus on the local bounty of the Driftless Region. 
  * **Flower-filled perennial gardens and romantic hidden woodlands** beside a historic windmill offer gorgeous outdoor ceremony spots. The restored 1919 red gambrel barn hosts stunning receptions, and makes a great “plan B” for vows in the event of rain. 
  * **The cabins, suites, and cottages can sleep up to 24 guests between them**(we’re smitten with the darling converted chicken coop!), and there are also two rustic tent camping sites for your adventure-loving pals.
