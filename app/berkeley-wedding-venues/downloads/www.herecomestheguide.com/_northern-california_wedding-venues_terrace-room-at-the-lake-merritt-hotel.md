## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its beautiful Art Deco ballroom and panoramic views of Lake Merritt,** this Oakland restaurant is truly a hidden gem. Throughout the day, the multilevel space is bathed in natural light, while after the sun sets it has an intimate, almost cabaret feeling. During evening events, you'll be treated to exquisite views of the Necklace of Lights, a glittering string of lights that encircles the lake in an enchanting glow.
  * **Built in 1927, the space retains the feeling of a stylish bygone era** with details like the custom three-foot bronze pendant light fixtures and original wrought-iron elements. Most notably, there's a wall of 20-foot, floor-to-ceiling windows that treats guests to a bird’s-eye view of the lake and distant hills. 
  * **All-inclusive packages feature their delicious upscale American cuisine** , with an extensive selection of menus to fit every taste and budget. You'll also enjoy a wide range of in-house amenities, like elegant Chiavari chairs and a professional sound system, along with the assistance of the friendly, accommodating staff to tailor each element to you.
