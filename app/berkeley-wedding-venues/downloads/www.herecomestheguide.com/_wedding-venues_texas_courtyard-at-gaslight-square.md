## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked behind wrought-iron gates,** this unique venue evokes a bygone town square with a mix of rustic charm and old world style. The expansive Courtyard features a brick entry, central park with a majestic oak tree, and intriguing side streets with colorful building facades for your guests to explore. 
  * **Exchange your vows beneath the twinkle-lit branches of that noble oak,** then enjoy dinner al fresco or move inside to the Gaslight Room or Plaza Room, followed by dancing under the stars. The indoor/outdoor flow here is exceptional with an array of great visual backdrops to help your photos go viral.
  * **Their experienced staff has amassed years of event planning success** so they can assist you every step of the way—from planning to coordinating décor, entertainment, florals, etc. And their in-house catering consistently receives raves for their culinary skills as well as variety and presentation.
