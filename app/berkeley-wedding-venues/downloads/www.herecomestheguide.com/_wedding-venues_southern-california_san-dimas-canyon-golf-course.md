## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its stunning mountain panoramas and meticulously manicured grounds,** this popular golf course has much to recommend it. A talented, flexible staff, multiple indoor & outdoor events spaces, and varied menu options (including an in-house wedding cake!) make it a breeze to create a wedding that fits your budget and style.
  * **A sweet vintage clock adorns one of the ceremony sites,** perched on a verdant knoll overlooking the landscaped grounds. The other, a tranquil Gazebo nestled among lush shrubs and flowers, offers an intimate garden vibe. After the "I do"s, you'll want to snap stunning photos amid the tree- and lake-studded greens as your guests transition to the reception.
  * **Dine and dance al fresco on the gracious Oak Tree Courtyard,** shaded by arching oak canopies with bistro lights to add a romantic glow. Or, celebrate in the Canyon View Room, which opens onto an expansive veranda—either way, you'll be treated to fabulous views of the golf course and surrounding San Gabriel mountains.
