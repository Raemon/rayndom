## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This historic chapel is charming on the outside, spectacular on the inside.** Dedicated by Eleanor Roosevelt in 1939, it's been named one of Texas' most outstanding architectural achievements.
  * **The soaring interior brick archways create an inspiring setting.** Chandeliers of glass and gold illuminate the center aisle leading to the altar, which is adorned with a beautiful, tall, stained-glass window.
  * **You can add even more impact to your vows with a unity candle, sand, knot, or cross ceremony.** Then linger on the grounds for some portraits under the trees or on a bench beneath an old-fashioned street lamp.
