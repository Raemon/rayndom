## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You'll immediately feel at home at this four generation family-owned vineyard,** which boasts a legacy of heart and heritage that sets it apart. Whether you envision a classic Wine Country wedding among the grapes, a low-key and intimate gathering, or a chic soiree in a light-flooded modern tasting room, there's a venue here to fit your tastes.
  * **The beautiful seven-acre Schoolhouse Plaza evokes a time past, with unique vintage buildings** and plenty of al fresco event space. The white wedding chapel provides a quaint backdrop for ceremonies, followed cocktail hour on the bocce court and receptions in the former Hopland High School building, which has been thoughtfully restored to maintain its original charm.
  * **On a sun-splashed hilltop bounded by lush vines,** Contento Vineyard's velvety lawn sets the stage for a spectacular al fresco soiree surrounded by jaw-dropping vistas of the region's golden hills. Let your reception flow between the rustic party and an adjacent white tent, allowing your guests to experience the gorgeous views from every angle.
