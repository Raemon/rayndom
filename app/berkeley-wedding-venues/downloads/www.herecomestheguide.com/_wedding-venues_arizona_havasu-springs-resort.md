## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched atop a ridge at the southern tip of Lake Havasu,** this all-season resort boasts stunning views of the water and dramatic desert hills, and offers easy access to all the area’s popular activities. 
  * **Say “I do” at The Pointe, a red-rock bluff overlooking the water.** Capture unforgettable photos thanks to its breathtaking 360-degree panorama, then shift the celebration to the chic Harbor Room, with its vaulted ceiling, reclaimed wood beams, and romantic Edison lighting.
  * **Four unique hotel properties** offer guests a broad range of accommodation choices, many of which are designed to host families and groups. There’s also a private marina where your boat-loving visitors can dock, and an on-site RV park with full hookups.
