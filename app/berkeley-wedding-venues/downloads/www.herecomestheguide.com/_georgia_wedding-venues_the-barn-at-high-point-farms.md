## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set in the shadow of Lookout Mountain, this 70-acre flower farm** offers an intimate, romantic gathering place for your wedding. After exchanging vows in a sun-dappled woodland grove, join your guests for dining & dancing in the climate-controlled barn, where sparkling twinkle lights are draped from the soaring ceilings.
  * **You can't get more local than their farm-to-table florals,** grown right on-site in boutique gardens and carefully crafted into one-of-a-kind arrangements and bouquets. Thanks to this spectacular setting, there are photo ops around every corner: you'll love strolling the gorgeous flower fields and snapping adorable pics with the friendly baby goats. 
  * **Thoughtful details are at the heart of their carefully curated packages:** whether you're seeking an intimate elopement, a grand all-inclusive soiree, or something perfectly in-between, you'll find a selection to fit your needs. We recommend spending your wedding night in their sweet Treehouse to start your honeymoon off right!
