## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked at the heart of Center City,** this completely unique social club is home to a hotel, gym, spa, workspaces, event rooms, world-class art collection, and more—all under one welcoming, ultra-stylish roof. 
  * **Hold a ceremony in the quaint walled garden,** then move inside for a dynamic reception in the Trophy Room, with its private bowling alley and old-school arcade games. There’s also the Ballroom, with its exposed brick walls and expansive floor plan that allows for a host of layout options.
  * **The Rooms at Fitler Club****offer accommodations** for up to 28 guests across fourteen stylish suites. Boasting luxury baths, chic furnishings, and access to all the Club’s amenities, overnighting here is a fab way to extend the weekend’s festivities.
