## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This idyllic hilltop lodge is nestled on a picturesque plot** in the heart of charming Cambria, minutes from all the Central Coast has to offer. Hearst Castle is a mere nine miles to the north, the beach is minutes away, and wine tasting has become a popular pastime in Cambria and the surrounding San Luis Obispo County.
  * **The world-class gardens evoke an exquisite English estate,** with curving paths that meander amid rows of sculpted hedges, beds of vibrantly colored flowers, and stately Monterey pines. Couples get married in a lovely gazebo at one end, reached by an enchanting stepping-stone aisle surrounded by plush lawns.
  * **Follow with an al fresco reception in the enchanting Pavilion,** or transition into the elegant Peacock Room, which is adorned with soft wall drapery and an abundance of pine wainscoting and trim. After the celebration, retire to the Lounge, where a fire blazes in the floor-to-ceiling river rock fireplace, and chandeliers glow overhead.
