## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **There are lovely options for indoor and outdoor celebrations.** When the weather is nice, ceremonies may be held right on the green, letting the sky and hills serve as a natural backdrop. Inside the French Normandy-inspired clubhouse, there’s a renovated Grand Ballroom that looks out over the course, and a smaller Garden Room with a gracious, “enclosed porch” design.
  * **You’re guaranteed some beautiful photos.** Turnberry is one of the most-loved golf clubs in the area, and for good reason. The artfully manicured grounds are dotted with pretty flowering plants, weeping willows, water features, and towering oak and pepper trees, while the brick and wood buildings add a rustic, Old World touch.
  * **Their affordable packages may be customized as needed.** Two set packages offer just about everything you’ll need, but on-site planners will be happy to help you personalize your menu and arrange for additional services, like themed decorations, luncheons, and rounds of golf for the wedding party.
