## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Bird's-eye views don't get much better** than those from the Sky Terrace. Sparkling panoramas of the Gulf of Mexico and Intracoastal Waterway form a stunning backdrop to your outdoor ceremony and reception.
  * **Go for upscale elegance in the Aqualea Ballroom** , where impressive chandeliers hang from the vaulted ceiling. Or, choose the Belleair room which features floor to ceiling windows that overlook Clearwater Beach and the Gulf.
  * **In addition to more intimate event settings** , the resort also has dining options for rehearsal dinners and farewell brunches. Plus, you'll get a complimentary honeymoon room, on-site spa, poolside cabanas, and nearby sightseeing.
