## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Lush gardens and romantic scenery abound at this pretty private events venue.** Flowering plants, shade trees, and winding paths are illuminated with twinkle lights, so it's especially lovely as the sun sets.
  * **Cross a romantic footbridge to your ceremony site—a flagstone terrace** with a scrolled rustic wooden arch. Continue the celebration inside, where the gracious space boasts wood wainscoting, sliding barn doors, and rustic antler chandeliers. 
  * **Reasonable rates include lots of planning help** from their dedicated, experienced staff. From assisting with vendor selection and menu planning to setup of the event space and day-of coordination, these experts are dedicated to ensuring that you can enjoy your big day, worry-free.
