## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The Clubhouse is magnificent** , built in the traditional Georgian style and graced with white columns. Prepare to be wowed as you approach from the long treelined driveway that leads to the entrance.
  * **Spaciousness and elegance abound.** The living room features a large fireplace and opens onto a deck overlooking the golf course and the lawn below—the ideal place for a cocktail reception. Chandeliers sparkle in the Grand Ballroom, and French doors and floor-to-ceiling windows let in natural light.
  * **Several different reception options** range from formal sit-down dining to more casual food stations.
