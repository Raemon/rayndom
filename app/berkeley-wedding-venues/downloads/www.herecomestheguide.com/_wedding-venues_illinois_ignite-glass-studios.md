## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This cool loft-style building has tons of customizable space,** and because it’s a functioning glass studio, you can even arrange for dramatic glass blowing demonstrations during your event! For something particularly special, ask about the custom unity ceremony—choose two glass colors and Ignite Glass Studio’s talented artists will blow them together before your eyes, creating a one-of-a-kind bowl or vase to represent your newly joined future.
  * **The Event Studio is completely open and unobstructed** , with a high ceiling, exposed ductwork, and concrete flooring. An all-glass wall looks out onto the Urban Garden, which is surrounded by fruit trees and colorful glass floral accents—a lovely spot for a cocktail hour.
  * **Hold an unforgettable ceremony on the Rooftop Deck** , which provides jaw-dropping views of the iconic Chicago skyline. At night, glowing café lights add a romantic touch to the proceedings as the lights of the city sparkle around you.
