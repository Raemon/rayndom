## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set right on the edge of sparkling Lake Martin,** this secluded spot offers unobstructed water views and tons of venue choices across its manicured, estate-style grounds. 
  * **Cocktails by the pool or in the sprawling manor,** a ceremony on the private dock, a reception beneath the shade of an open-sided pavilion—the sprawling property means tons of flexibility in designing the celebration you’re envisioning. 
  * **Your experienced, caring event staff** will ensure things run smoothly, and their packages are some of the most affordable in the area. You’re welcome to bring in the vendors of your choice (including caterers), and there is plentiful lodging available nearby.
