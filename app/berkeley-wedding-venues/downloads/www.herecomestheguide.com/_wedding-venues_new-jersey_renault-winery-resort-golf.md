## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This unique, historic resort offers a host of stunning venues** and enough fabulous wedding weekend diversions to delight everyone on your guest list. Some of our favorite must-see spots: the fun, vintage Speakeasy and the Glass Museum, which houses wine & champagne glassware dating to the 13th century.
  * **They have so many festive, flexible celebration options,** including The Champagne Ballroom, which wows with its strikingly elegant fabric-draped ceiling and dazzling crystal chandelier, and the Vineyard Ballroom, evoking the feel of a French country estate with its lofty exposed beams and farmhouse windows.
  * **The on-site hotel, Chateau Renault,** boasts a collection of 55 rooms and suites, giving your guests easy access to the resort’s awesome amenities—wine tasting, cabin cabanas, a seasonal pool, championship golf, and more.
