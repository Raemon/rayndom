## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With multiple levels and a cool, industrial-chic style** , this private downtown Dallas venue offers loads of flexibility and stellar views of the city skyline. 
  * **Exchange vows in the penthouse (perfect for a candlelit ceremony)** , followed by a reception in the ultra-sleek Commerce Room, with its exposed brick and ductwork, maple dance floor, and an original Coca-Cola mural from the 1940s. 
  * **You can host your entire event on the spacious rooftop sky deck** , where you'll find wrought-iron patio furniture, globe string lighting, an elevated stage, and a custom cedar bar.
