## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With the ambiance of an enchanting Italian palazzo,** this exquisite winery estate is tucked among 110 acres of vineyards with views of Mt. Hamilton and Ruby Hill. The culinary program matches the setting's refinement and elegance, with award-winning menus that are guaranteed to wow your guests.
  * **A winding pathway leads to the Vineyard Lawn and Terrace,** a scenic setting for your "I do"s or a charming cocktail hour, with bistro lights glowing overhead. A well-manicured lawn off the ballroom is another lovely option, perhaps for a ceremony beneath a gorgeous trellis or for a convivial chat among the palms.
  * **High Roman windows line the soaring walls of the ballroom** , which boasts a 24-foot-high ceiling, gleaming honey-colored Italian tile floors, and sumptuous furnishings. Through the glass doors you'll find a charming patio, perfect for enjoying after dinner drinks beneath the stars.
