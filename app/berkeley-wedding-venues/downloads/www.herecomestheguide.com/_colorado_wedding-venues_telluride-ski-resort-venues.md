## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Telluride Ski Resorts' multiple different venues** all provide a unique, Colorado mountain wedding experience. From a former ranch-turned-ski lodge to a glorious mountaintop ceremony overlook, they collectively offer indoor and outdoor event spaces as well as stunning mountain views.
  * **Each venue offers panoramic mountain views** that stretch for miles. The stunning hilltop Peaks Resort, with its airy decks and terraces, boasts glass walls and floor-to-ceiling windows for a unique indoor/outdoor experience. Other options include the Gorrono Ranch, a mid-mountain ski lodge with a luxe indoor dining hall and multiple outdoor decks surrounded by forest, and the two stunning al fresco ceremony venues, Palmyra Lookout and San Sophia Overlook, both boasting 360-degree views of the snow-capped San Juan mountains.
  * **The restaurants charm guests with warm, wood interiors** **and cozy fireplaces**. Each serves up a different style of food: contemporary American at Allred's (and its private dining room), fun and eclectic at Tomboy Tavern, and Northern Italian at Alpino Vino. The expert chefs will customize your menu, preparing anything from a rustic western BBQ to an exquisite multi-course candlelit dinner.
