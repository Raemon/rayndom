## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its seamless blend of classic Southern hospitality and casual California charm,** this iconic resort offers a setting that is quintessentially "Napa." The ample guest accommodations are varied and plush, and the farm-to-fork cuisine showcases the region's very best fare. Plus, with two PGA golf courses, a world-class spa, 10 sparkling pools, and plenty of nearby hiking and biking trails, there's no shortage of activities to fill your wedding weekend.
  * **Ancient oaks rise to create a soaring natural ceremony arch in The Grove,** a magnificent al fresco venue bordered by a burbling creek and a romantic, bistro-lit courtyard perfect for dancing under the stars. Alternately, exchange vows in the Arbor, a sunken courtyard encircled by rose bushes and manicured hedges, or the Mansion Gardens, framed on both sides by trellised vines.
  * **From the expansive Fairway Deck, the views unfurl past the emerald golf greens and lush vineyards** to encompass the stunning Vaca Mountain Range, which is particularly beautiful when lit by the buttery glow of a sunset. A full tent and enclosable clear walls make this a lovely spot in any weather, or you can pass through a set of French doors into the classically lovely Grand Ballroom for an elegant seated reception.
