## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This serene, 150-acre Hudson Valley horse farm and wedding venue** is family-owned and just 1.5 hours from NYC. Rent it for the whole weekend and let your guests extend their enjoyment with hiking, biking, swimming holes, campfires with s'mores, farmers' markets, and even skydiving.
  * **In summer and fall, you can dance the night away under glowing paper lanterns** in the covered, weather-proof pavilion. It comes with stunning 360-degree views of the mountains, grazing horses, and guinea hens! 
  * **You'll have maximum flexibility.** Bring in your own caterer and your choice of décor. Host a cocktail party in the hammock forest or let your friends pitch a tent on the lawn on the wedding night. They offer coordination services for an extra fee, but you can DIY as much of your wedding as you desire.
