## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The venue is charming and old-fashioned.** Think _Anne of Green Gables:_ it’s an all-white clapboard house with a gabled roof and wraparound porch.
  * **Getting ready is a pleasure in the dressing suite.** It's a light-filled, richly appointed beige and white room with a gleaming wood-finished fireplace, armoire, and dresser.
  * **The lawn is a romantic place to say “I do.”** Exchange vows against a backdrop of trees beneath the wooden trellis provided by the venue. Add decorations to suit your taste, or leave them as is for a simple, more natural look. The natural wooden barn is a fun place for photos, too.
