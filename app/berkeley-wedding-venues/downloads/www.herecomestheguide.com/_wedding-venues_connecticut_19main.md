## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This former bank sits at the edge of New Milford's town green,** and wedding parties have a wonderful time capturing photos around the charming surrounding streets, which are peppered with sweet shops, vintage streetlights, and an Art Deco movie theater. 
  * **Pass through the stately granite facade to discover a host of gorgeous architectural and design elements,** including exposed brick, a dramatic floor-to-ceiling window in the main reception room, and three of the bank's original vaults. 
  * **There are lovely dressing suites right on site—** a plush, light-filled lounge for the gals, and a cozy hideout for the guys, outfitted with game tables and deep leather couches.
