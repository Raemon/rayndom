## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With gorgeous views of Aldeen Golf Club’s rolling green hills,** this stylish, rustic-chic venue offers both indoor and outdoor gathering spaces, pretty photo ops, and a great location that's easily accessible from Chicago, Madison, and Milwaukee. 
  * **We simply love the modern farmhouse vibe of the Pavilion,** which boasts exposed whitewashed walls and rafters, circular chandeliers, tons of natural light, and a striking stone fireplace. Two covered pergolas make a great option for cocktail hour and additional flow during your reception. 
  * **Gio Events is your caring, experienced coordination and catering service.** With their more than 45 years orchestrating stellar celebrations, you’ll be in capable hands, working with a staff that treats you like family.
