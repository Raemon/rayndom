## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The setting is scenic:****endless woodlands all around** and a beautiful 18-hole golf course contribute to a gorgeous landscape. Idyllic outdoor ceremonies take place on an expansive lawn bordered by trees, or beneath a classic white pergola next to the pond. Of course, the photo ops are irresistible, from a picturesque covered bridge to the lake and fairways.
  * **Inviting reception spaces include The Heritage Room** with its vaulted ceiling, marble fireplace, and view of Wheeler Pond, as well as the octagonal cocktail lounge, where guests enjoy 360-degree views of the golf course.
  * **The club only hosts one event per day** , so you get their full attention. A choice of wedding packages makes planning easy, and they're happy to customize your menu. There's also a discount on packages at certain times of the year!
