## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked in a secluded expanse of forest along the St. Joseph River,** this family-owned venue offers a tranquil woodland escape just 90 minutes from both Grand Rapids and Chicago.
  * **Wed in the Meadow as the river rolls gently along in the background,** then get the party started with cocktails in the Courtyard. Outdoor receptions are a dream in the modern, steel-framed Garden Pavilion, but just as lovely indoors is the rustic-industrial Banquet Hall. 
  * **The Studio Dome offers a glam space for day-of prep,** with quaint vintage furnishings and lots of natural light. Nestled amid the pines, there’s another special suite, the cozy, log cabin-style Forest Lounge.
