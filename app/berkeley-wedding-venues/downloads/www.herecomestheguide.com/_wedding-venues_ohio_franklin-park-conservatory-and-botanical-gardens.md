## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Spread across thirteen acres and home to an endless variety of plant life,** artwork, historic buildings, and inviting gathering spaces, this unique botanical garden offers options to suit weddings of any size and style—and your rental fees help support the Conservatory’s mission to bring educational, natural, and social experiences to the Columbus community. 
  * **Wed in the Edwardian grandeur of the John F. Wolfe Palm House,** whose glass walls and ceiling house a lush tropical garden. The contemporary Worthington Industries Veridian boasts Chihuly glasswork and a colorful Celebration Garden for ceremonies and outdoor affairs.
  * **The 200 year-old Wells Barn has a rustic-elegant feel,** with a weathered timber frame, wood flooring, and a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace. A pretty adjacent courtyard can host your vows or cocktail hour, and its surrounding gardens create a wonderful photo backdrop.
