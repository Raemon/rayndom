## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Discover a true Philadelphia treasure inside this restored 1855 townhome:** an artfully created boutique hotel with a special past, it was the long-time home of the New Century Guild, an organization that worked toward the betterment of working women, and strives to honor its legacy into a new era.
  * **Layers of lush jewel-toned fabrics, vintage furnishings, and romantic lighting about.** Perfect for intimate guest lists up to 25, the entire glamorous building is at your disposal, giving you the flexibility to host a festive celebration in the opulent lounge, an intimate cocktail party-style soiree in one of the guest suites, or craft your own unique flow between spaces.
  * **Your buyout includes lodgings in twelve swoon-worthy rooms and suites,** which feature posh-but-gracious décor that is whimsical and creative (think sumptuous linens, art wallpaper, luxurious locally-made bath products), but also embraces the hotel’s historic character.
