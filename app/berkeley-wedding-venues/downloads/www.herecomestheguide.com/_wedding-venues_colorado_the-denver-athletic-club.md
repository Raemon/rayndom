## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A rooftop Sundeck with great views is just one of many venues here.** Downtown Denver’s premier private club offers a fabulous array of wedding options for members and non-members alike, along with topnotch service and excellent cuisine.
  * **The club has an embarrassment of riches with TWO ballrooms** so you can best match your style. The Grand Ballroom features posh chandeliers, crystal sconces and a high ceiling, while the Centennial blends expansive windows with warm woods and an intimate feel.
  * **You can turn a shower or bachelor party into retro fun** at their 1950s-style bowling alley. Prefer playing pool? They also have a 7-table billiards room, card room, cool tavern restaurant and large screens so you can eat, drink AND keep an eye on the game.
