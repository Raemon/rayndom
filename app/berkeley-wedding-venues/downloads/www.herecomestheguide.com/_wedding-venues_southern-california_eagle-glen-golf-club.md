## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked among the wild chaparral-covered hills of Corona's lofty west side,** this impressive golf club is a refreshing surprise. While you're on the golf course, you're in a private, human realm, but once you leave the greens and start heading up the hills, you enter a dramatic domain of untamed landscapes. In other words, Eagle Glen offers the perfect blend of nature and nurture.
  * **The Lakeside ceremony site features a wooden arbor,** perched on a small rise above a reed-ringed pond with a fountain playing at its center. Surrounding it are close-cropped greens that flow up to the foot of the hills. A graceful low wooden bridge that spans the pond at its narrowest point is a splendid spot for photos.
  * **Inside the cupola-topped clubhouse, the spacious ballroom's floor-to-ceiling windows** and glass doors frame picturesque views of the back nine's grand swath of lawn as it tumbles toward the clubhouse from the edge of the national forest. The seasoned catering staff is at hand throughout, ensuring your guests savor every bite of the delectable in-house cuisine.
