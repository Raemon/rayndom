## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

"The Place with Panoramic Views of the Saddleback Valley" might be a more apt name for Aliso Viejo by Wedgewood Weddings, peacefully perched above the valley and overlooking acres of greenery. Weddings are popular here and begin on the Fireside Lawn, named for the tall stone fireplace where couples tie the knot. Feathery palm trees and beautiful landscaping, together with the sweeping vistas, create a lovely park-like ambiance for this important moment.

While your photographer is capturing post-ceremony smiles and kisses, the festivities kick into high gear with the cocktail hour on the spacious patio, enhanced with comfy furnishings, congenial fire pits, and market lights. As guests toast the newlyweds, they gaze out past manicured greens towards a glorious sunset over the valley. The patio can also host intimate outdoor receptions.

Large gatherings are held in the handsome, Mediterranean-style grand ballroom, with floor-to-ceiling windows framing the serene panorama. The vaulted, wood-beamed ceiling and neutral-hued walls give the space an open, airy feeling and complement any color scheme. There's plenty of room for dancing indoors, but on a balmy evening guests are more likely to head for the patio, where they can enjoy the starry night sky.

As with all of their fine locations, Wedgewood Weddings makes it easy for couples to have a celebration that matches their vision as well as their budget. Wedding packages are fully customizable and include a range of event extras like florals, music, and invitations to help ensure a stress-free and fun wedding-planning experience. Whether your special occasion is simply elegant or elegantly simple, Aliso Viejo by Wedgewood Weddings event specialists will give it the attention it deserves.
