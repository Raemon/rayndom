## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set in the heart of a working equestrian property,** this beautiful space sits just south of Fort Worth, boasting rural charm and modern, custom-built venues for both indoor and outdoor celebrations. 
  * **A 1950s farmhouse has been renovated into a posh, comfortable dressing suite,** and two cute casitas offer additional dressing areas. The lakeside ceremony area has a stately cedar altar, and the pavilion is rustic and inviting, with touches like Edison lights and exposed brick.
  * **Packages are available for events grand or intimate,** and can be customized with additions like speciality lighting and overnight accommodations in the casita suites. Little ones on your guest list will love the treehouse and tire swing.
