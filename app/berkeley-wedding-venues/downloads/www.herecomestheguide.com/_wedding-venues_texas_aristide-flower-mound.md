## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **For a timeless and romantic ceremony, the chapel offers some beautiful features:** leaded-glass doors framed in rich wood, a vaulted ceiling hung with chandeliers, large windows that let in natural light, and rows of hardwood pews leading to a raised altar for added visibility.
  * **The elegant ballroom is fully outfitted.** From Chiavari chairs, tables, linens and china to audiovisual capabilities and a full-service bar, you won’t have to worry about the reception details. 
  * **Two Wedding Suites make getting ready for your big day a pleasure!** The larger suite features a long makeup counter and private bathroom, while the other one lets you relax in comfortable lounge furniture.
