## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The Spanish Colonial landmark nestled on this al fresco oasis** in the heart of Downtown Fullerton was once considered the "finest hotel in the state." Today, thoughtful renovations have transformed this 1923 gem into a vibrant event event space while retaining all of its original charm.
  * **Take center stage in the lushly landscaped central courtyard,** flanked by ivy-draped breezeways, soaring palms, and colorful tropical foliage. Here, you're surrounded by historic details: red-tile roofs, graceful arches, wrought-iron railings, airy terraces and walkways, and a serene Spanish-style fountain at its core.
  * **You'll enjoy all this beauty and elegance at a surprisingly affordable price,** meaning you have the flexibility to add your own special touches to the day. Go wild with bursts of blooms, hire a mariachi band, or simply let the magic of the place speak for itself as you dance the night away beneath glowing bistro lights.
