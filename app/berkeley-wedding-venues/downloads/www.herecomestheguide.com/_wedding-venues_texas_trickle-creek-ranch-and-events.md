## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This pretty, private venue has a modern-rustic ranch vibe,** with acres of 250-year-old trees, vintage-inspired architecture outfitted with everything you need for the perfect party—and it’s only 30 minutes from Ft. Worth.
  * **Say “I do” in a shady oak grove,** followed by lawn games on the grass and cocktails beneath the covered veranda. Then, shift the party to the bright and airy Dutch-style barn, whose soaring two-story ceiling is hung with three-tiered chandeliers of intricate wrought iron.
  * **There’s a darling cottage for getting ready,** compete with a full kitchen and bath, a living space, and an expansive prep area with lounge furniture, a full-length mirror, a vanity for hair & makeup, a fireplace, and a massage chair! And there's a second space that's a bonus—a cool bunkhouse with a comfortable gathering room… complete with shuffleboard!
