## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Historic, grand, and just two blocks from the White House** , this iconic Beaux-Arts and Neo-Renaissance hotel has been visited by every American president since Calvin Coolidge cut the opening ribbon in 1926.
  * **The Astor Ballroom is magnificent,** with rows of arched palladium windows, drop-tiered crystal chandeliers, and dark wood ceiling beams embellished with delicate hand-painted flourishes. Abundant natural light floods the space, gleaming off the exquisite hardwood floors.
  * **The Astor Terrace, with the timeless elegance of its European landscaping** and the sophistication of the fountain, is the perfect setting for your al fresco "I do"s.
