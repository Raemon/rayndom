## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Dating from the late 1920s,** this former manufacturing warehouse has been artfully renovated, preserving its heritage while infusing the design with contemporary flair and essential event amenities. 
  * **The interior is a lovely blend of historic industrial design and warm, modern touches.** Oversized windows ensure tons of natural light fills the main room, and a gently curving staircase leads to the lower level and makes a great spot for dramatic photos. 
  * **Can we rave about The Ladyslipper Lounge for a minute?** This gorgeous hideaway on the venue’s lower level boasts a sleek bar, poshly inviting lounge furniture, and “living terrarium”—a deep nook filled with lush tropical plants whose light casts a dreamy glow across the entire space.
