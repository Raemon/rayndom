## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked against the border of Pisgah National Forest,** this pretty spot offers some seriously awesome photo ops (you’re just a mile from the Appalachian Trail), and though it feels delightfully secluded, it’s only fifteen minutes from downtown Erwin. 
  * **The central gathering area was absolutely made for parties,** with a spacious deck for ceremonies, a sprawling lawn, and an ultra-cool half-cylindrical pavilion, open on both ends and lit by strings of bistro lights. 
  * **When they say “glamping”, they mean it—** your posh overnight options include safari-style canvas platform tents, adorably decked-out Airstream trailers, and an utterly charming elevated “tree house” overlooking Spivey Creek.
