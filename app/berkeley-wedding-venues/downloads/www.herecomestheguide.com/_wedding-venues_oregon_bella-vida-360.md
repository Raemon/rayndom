## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **From this blufftop aerie, you’ll find vineyard vistas, mountain peaks, and sunset skies all in one panoramic frame.** Perched on a dramatic ridge in the Willamette Valley, this aptly named venue boasts 360-degree views that feel truly cinematic—especially when golden hour lights up the astonishing surroundings.
  * **There’s a dreamy half-acre lawn for ceremonies, where you’ll say “I do” framed by the Cascade Mountains,** including the iconic peaks of Mount Adams, Mount Jefferson, and Mount Hood. Continue with a tented reception here, or dine and dance on the covered patio beneath the sparkling stars. 
  * **Intimate elopements are lovely in the modern, light-filled tasting room,** where oversized doors open wide to let the breeze (and the views) spill in, blending indoors and out with ease. Be sure to steal away to the lush forest of Douglas firs, where you can snap truly romantic photos amid the mature trees.
