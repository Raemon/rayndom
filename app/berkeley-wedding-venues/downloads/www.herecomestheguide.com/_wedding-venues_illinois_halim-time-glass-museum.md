## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The Rooftop Garden of this unique, privately owned museum offers striking views** of downtown and Lake Michigan—it’s an incredible spot for a ceremony or cocktail hour. For intimate celebrations, opt for the Tiffany Gallery, whose walls are adorned with dazzling backlit stained glass pieces.
  * **The ceiling of the breathtaking Wisteria Room is hung with tiered Art Nouveau chandeliers** of frosted glass, and crowned with an exquisite stained glass dome depicting a blooming wisteria vine suspended in an arbor.
  * **Guests can be treated to self-guided tours of the fascinating collection,** which includes significant paintings, artifacts, works by some of the country’s most renowned glass artists, and an international representation of watches and clocks dating from the 1600s.
