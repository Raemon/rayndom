## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It’s an 1847 Georgian mansion** that’s home to the area’s favorite Spanish restaurant. Surrounded by four acres of lush grounds, this spot is a peaceful retreat from life’s daily bustle. 
  * **Host an intimate celebration on the home's second floor,** whose rooms boast ornate period details, or opt for a larger soiree in the adjacent Pavilion, where you’ll find three walls of windows and a fabric-draped ceiling hung with multiple chandeliers. 
  * **Guests are sure to love the menu,** which focuses on Spanish classics like tapas and paella. Don’t forget to toast with a glass (or three) of their luscious sangria!
