## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This peaceful, family-run spot is completely surrounded by towering cedars.** Though it feels like a hidden fairytale forest, it's an easy drive to both Salem and Portland. 
  * **Exchange vows beneath a rustic arbor, then celebrate on the lawn** with cocktails served from a custom bar of corrugated metal and rough-hewn wood. 
  * **Dine and dance under the stars—the grounds are beautiful at night** , and guests will love wandering the romantically lit woodland paths.
