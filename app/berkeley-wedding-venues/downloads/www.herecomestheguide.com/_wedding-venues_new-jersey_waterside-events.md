## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perfectly placed on the Hudson River just five minutes from New York City,** this exquisite venue is a treat for anyone who loves the Big Apple. With customizable event spaces, state-of-the-art lighting and sound systems, and award-winning, chef-driven cuisine, the only limit to your celebration is your imagination.
  * **The glimmering water parallels the your walk to the shoreline ceremony site,** meaning you'll have a jaw-dropping backdrop for your vows: sweeping panoramas of the Manhattan skyline. Two lavish, glass-walled ballrooms ensure you'll never lose sight of that iconic vista: as the sun sets, you'll be treated to the sparkling lights of the city and stars above.
  * **Wedding packages are made for pampering.** White glove service, personal attendants, elegant place cards, and other perks are included to make your day completely stress-free. You'll be in good hands with their expert team, which include fabulous event planners and Executive Chefs from the Cooking Institute of America.
