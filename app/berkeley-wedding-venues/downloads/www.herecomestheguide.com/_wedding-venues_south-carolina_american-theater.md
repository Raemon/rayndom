## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This iconic, Art Deco landmark adds jazzy glamour** to downtown Charleston. Built in 1942—heyday of the swanky movie palaces—it gives your wedding the excitement of a red carpet arrival with your names up in lights on the big marquee.
  * **The vintage lobby and concession stand is a fun place** to welcome guests. There's an intimate lounge for cocktails and a luxurious ballroom with hand-made glass chandeliers, state-of-the-art AV, and a stage for your ceremony, band, or DJ.
  * **Their Culinary Institute-trained executive chef** has a stellar reputation earned from numerous high-profile events and festivals. With innovative displays, boutique wine pairings, and cake creations from their own pastry chef, you'll have Instagram-worthy food photos.
