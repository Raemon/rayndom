## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **A family-run winery in Oregon’s world-renowned Willamette Vally region,** this beautiful estate is just 30 minutes south of Portland, and boasts stunning grounds with a pond, gardens, a rustic-chic tasting room, and rolling acres of vines. 
  * **The outdoor amphitheater provides sweeping views across the vineyards** **and mountains,** creating a dramatic and romantic ceremony setting. In the event center, you’ll find an elegant, modern-farmhouse inspired design, with attached covered and uncovered patios to extend your celebration options. 
  * **Two spacious, light-filled dressing suites are yours for the morning,** and affordable catering is provided in-house, with fun choices like pasta, taco, and fajita bars—all of which can be paired with the Aurora’s award-winning wines.
