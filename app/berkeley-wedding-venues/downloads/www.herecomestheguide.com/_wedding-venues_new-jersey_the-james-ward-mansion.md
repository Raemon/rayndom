## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With a cheerful orange façade embellished by ornate ironwork,** this striking mansion calls to mind the colorful homes of the French Quarter. Welcoming to couples of all faiths and orientations, this gracious manor feels positively made for celebrations. 
  * **Inside, you’ll find sumptuously appointed rooms** dripping with dreamy period details, like soaring 24-foot ceilings, gilded woodwork, brocade wall coverings, and polished wood flooring. Delicate spiral staircases lead from the lower floors to the upper mezzanines, which boast wraparound balconies overlooking the festivities. 
  * **For an indoor affair with an outdoor flair,** consider the Garden Atrium, with its massive glass-domed roof, exposed brick accent walls, and marble tile floor. An opulent, three-tiered fountain, beautifully lit at night, mingles French and Spanish vibes in a uniquely New Orleans style.
