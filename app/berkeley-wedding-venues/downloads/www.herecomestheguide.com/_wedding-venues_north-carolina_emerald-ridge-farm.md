## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With acres of pastoral meadows, oaks, and rolling hills,** this historic farm feels ages away from modern life—though it's only a short twelve-minute drive from Asheville. There's a great hotel just five minutes away, plus cozy on-site lodgings for 11+ in the modern farmhouse (you can even encourage your nature-loving friends to pitch their tents and sleep over on-site!)
  * **Say "I do" with the distant mountains as your romantic backdrop,** celebrate in the classic red barn, or dance beneath the spacious covered pavilion, where the fresh air will invigorate you. Flexible packages can accommodate all wedding visions, from an intimate microwedding to a weekend-long retreat with lodging included.
  * **It's kid-friendly, dog-friendly, and the welcoming vibe will make you feel like family...** which makes sense, since it's family-owned and -managed! They are dedicated to making your wedding truly magical, and it shows: limiting the number of events and ensuring total exclusivity means you'll never feel like you're anything less than their full focus.
