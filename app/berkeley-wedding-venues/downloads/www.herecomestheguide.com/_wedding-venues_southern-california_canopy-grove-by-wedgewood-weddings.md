## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This new wedding venue is set amidst the scenic rolling hills and citrus groves of Inland North County,** and is purpose-built for an exquisite wedding experience. The ceremony garden is a serene and lovely enclave for exchanging vows, enhanced by bistro lights, greenery and seasonal blooms.
  * **The modern barn has vaulted ceilings, polished concrete dance floor and a snazzy built-in bar.** A huge window wall frame the picturesque panoramas--and it can be opened to create ideal flow with the outdoors. You can also host an open-air cocktail hour or reception, and guests can bask in the breathtaking views, uplit olive trees and meticulously landscaped grounds. 
  * **Savvy Wedgewood Wedding experts will help you build your own customized celebration package** to match your budget + vision.
