## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This historic golf course, nestled in the quiet El Dorado Park neighborhood** of Long Beach, has long been a favorite for locals, visitors, and golf pros. Couples looking for a wedding venue will be particularly pleased to find a talented, experienced staff on hand to guide them through the process... as well as affordable packages that welcome DIY-lovers and all-inclusive seekers alike.
  * **Towering trees shade the velvety Garden Ceremony Lawn,** which overlooks the 18th green. The lovely public park that surrounds the landscaped course frames it with even more trees, pretty paths, a quaint duck pond, and picturesque waterways—all ideal for beautiful day-of portraits.
  * **Keep the celebration al fresco with a reception in the airy Garden Pavilion,** a dramatic tented venue. Set apart from the clubhouse, it features a private Garden Patio entrance and a high, peaked ceiling with elegant draping; at night, chandeliers and twinkle lights contribute to a magical, fairy-tale atmosphere.
