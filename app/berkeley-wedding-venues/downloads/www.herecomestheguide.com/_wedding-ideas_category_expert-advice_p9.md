**Dear Here Comes The Guide: We are planning a fairly upscale and costly wedding for our daughter.** It is a destination wedding for our guests, but more local for the groom side. Therefore, our guests are not as likely to attend as the groom side. Do we have to split the guest list fifty-fifty? What is the norm?

###  [ Your Out-of-Town Wedding Guests ](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/your-out-of-town-wedding-guests-make-them-feel-welcome)

**One of the most endearing aspects of your wedding is how loved ones come together from the four corners of the world to celebrate.** By adding a few thoughtful details to your wedding festivities, you can return the favor and make your out-of-towners feel like VIPs.

**Dear Here Comes The Guide: Neither my fiancé nor I are at all religious despite our upbringings, though we do share a broad-based spirituality.** Our families are much more traditional, and might be offended if our wedding ceremony is entirely secular.

###  [ Champagne, Fashion, Hors d'oeuvres, and Gift Bags... ](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/why-attend-a-bridal-fair)

**Bridal fairs offer an efficient way to review what’s in the marketplace** —you can check out florists and photographers, sample the wares of cake makers, and listen to the music of a variety of DJs.

**With the holiday season fast approaching, I like to imagine where our company would have the most rocking holiday party ever.** Interestingly, I noticed that my shortlist of holiday event venues wasn’t that different from my fantasy wedding one: Classy art galleries, hip restaurants, sun-kissed vineyards… A dynamic setting can make any celebration pop.
