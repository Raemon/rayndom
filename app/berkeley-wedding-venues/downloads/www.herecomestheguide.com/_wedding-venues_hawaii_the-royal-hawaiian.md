## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

**5 Reasons why weddings at The Royal Hawaiian are so memorable:**

  1. **Location, location, location.** This landmark oceanfront venue, with its Moorish architecture and pink turrets, occupies a premier spot on the Ocean Lawn directly beside famed Waikiki Beach.
  2. **Ceremonies on the Ocean Lawn are picture-perfect:** Tie the knot just steps from the beach, with a view of iconic Diamond Head and the Waikiki shoreline. Garden wedding options are available, too.
  3. **Receptions with a view:** The Monarch Room’s glass doors open onto the resort’s lawns and a view of Diamond Head and the ocean.
  4. **“Royal Treatment” at the award-winning Abhasa Spa:** Voted one of the top spas in the U.S. by _Spas of America_ and _Wine and Food Travel,_ this is the only spa in Waikiki with outdoor treatment areas. A massage in their tropical garden is not to be missed!
  5. **Your Royal Hawaiian Honeymoon can be partially (or completely!) covered** using points you accrue when you book one of the resort’s wedding packages and when your guests reserve a room here.
