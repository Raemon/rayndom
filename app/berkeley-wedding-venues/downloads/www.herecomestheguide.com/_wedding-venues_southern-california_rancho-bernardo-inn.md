## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked among the rolling hills of San Diego’s North County,** this 265-acre Forbes-recommended resort**** is made for dreamy destination weddings. Whether your guests are coming from across the country or just a few minutes away, they'll feel whisked away to another world: one with a championship golf course, award-winning spa, plush guest rooms, and unmatched culinary experiences.
  * **Say "I do" in the lush gardens,****** surrounded by seasonal white roses,**** Italian cypress and olive trees, and charming European fountains... and graced by truly spectacular sunsets. Continue the celebration al fresco on the Bernardo Patio, then transition into the elegant Bernardo Ballroom, where floor-to-ceiling windows frame views of the manicured grounds..
  * **With the feel of a secluded Mediterranean estate,** you can't beat golden hour dinners in the Santiago Courtyard, followed by dancing in the Santiago Ballroom. For larger events, ceremonies & cocktails on the Aragon Lawn and Terrace West are lovely paired with a reception in the stately Aragon Ballroom, which boasts honey-toned walls, a high ceiling, and gorgeous pendant chandeliers.
