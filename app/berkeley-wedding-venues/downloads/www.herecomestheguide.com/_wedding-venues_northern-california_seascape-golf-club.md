## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Carved into a hillside of vast fairways, towering Monterey Cypress trees, and Pacific vistas,** this pretty club offers an enchanting backdrop for your wedding or landmark celebration. The surrounding scenery is truly photogenic, and couples love to pose among the picturesque golf greens and forested grounds, which are especially romantic at twilight when the setting sun kisses the blue surf in the distance.
  * **Ceremonies on the 10th Tee are followed by cocktails on a garden-style green** , surrounded by an open-air naturescape that’s often cooled by a gentle Pacific breeze. Receptions follow in the elegant, modern Monarch Reception Room, where high ceilings and large windows bring in natural light to lend an expansive ambiance, and guests can also step outside and enjoy the views from the adjoining deck.
  * **This full-service venue seamlessly brings together the essentials** to ensure every couple enjoys a custom, beautifully executed event. The generous packages always include their on-site coordinator, delicious in-house catering, and a staff fully dedicated to making your vision a reality.
