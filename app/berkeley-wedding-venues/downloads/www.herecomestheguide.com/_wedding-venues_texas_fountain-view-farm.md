## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This North Houston private events space has it all—** multiple indoor and outdoor celebration spots, a caring, experienced staff, a flexible vendor policy, and an ultra-convenient location within an easy drive to several accommodation options. 
  * **There’s a fantastic dedicated ceremony area** **overlooking the pond,** complete with a cupola-topped pergola. For your reception, there’s a two-story, light-filled reception hall, with a grand split staircase, stone fireplace, and soaring vaulted ceiling with exposed wood beams. 
  * **They offer plenty of great extra perks,** like a custom dressing suite with individual makeup stations and lighting, a spacious outdoor pavilion perfect for wedding parties to chill and fish in the pond, and the Something Borrowed Closet, which is chock-full of fabulous décor items for couples to use free of charge.
