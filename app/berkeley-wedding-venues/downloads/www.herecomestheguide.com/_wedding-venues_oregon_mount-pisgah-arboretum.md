## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You can get married in the midst of a 209-acre living tree museum!** Riverside trails, evergreen forests, a peaceful water garden, wildflower meadows and open views across oak savannahs make this arboretum the perfect wedding environment for a nature-loving couple. 
  * **The Tall Tree ceremony site is shaded by a stunning 150 year old white oak** and surrounded by the Great Meadow,**** allowing beautiful filtered sunlight to illuminate your vows. The Courtyard, hung with glowing twinkle lights, is the perfect intimate retreat for cocktails. 
  * **The rustic White Oak Pavilion makes an airy and spacious reception setting.** Large sliding glass barn doors open on all sides, creating a refreshing indoor-outdoor flow, and the large terraced courtyard and surrounding lawns are ideal for dancing and mingling.
