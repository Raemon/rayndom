## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Rustic countryside and a gracious mansion create a winning combo near DFW.** Open pasture, large oaks and a running creek offer photo ops, while their helpful staff and all-inclusive packages help you pick just the right setting for your event.
  * **The elegant estate presents a backdrop of Southern charm.** Indoors, there’s a fireplace lounge and winding staircase for cozy ceremonies, as well as a ballroom replete with rich woods, a crystal chandelier, and even French doors leading to a terrace. Outdoors, you’ll find a gorgeous gazebo and dock overlooking a stream.
  * **Packages include a long list of amenities** , like a ceremony in the location of your choice, private use of the luxurious Bridal Suite and Groom’s Lounge, a wedding coordinator for rehearsal and day-of ceremony, in-house centerpiece options and upgraded linen, and more.
