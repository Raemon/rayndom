## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A 35-acre****wonderland** **of gardens, whimsical sculptures, topiary figures, and fanciful structures,** this property is a remarkable labor of love by its current owners. So many things here delight and amaze: redwoods standing gray under morning clouds; flowers splashed along every path; and unexpected stairways that lead the curious to bentwood benches at the edge of a sweeping meadow.
  * **Descend a broad staircaseto the flagstone ampitheater, nestled at the edge of a forest-fringed lake.** We can't imagine a more romantic ceremony site than this remarkable natural cathedral—here, sheltered by soaring redwoods and lush ferns, you'll exchange vows beneath a hand-built pergola draped with wisteria.
  * **Receptions are held in the jaw-dropping glass-and-fir Barn,** where slender timber columns support a dramatic steep-pitched ceiling. Its adjoining terrace is embraced by a sweeping meadow fragrant and gardens that are bursting with fanciful life: A topiary serpent undulates through a sea of long fescue, and a willow-lined koi pond is embellished by a brass stork.
