## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This charming colonial-style site offers the ideal backdrop** for an outdoor ceremony. Or, if you prefer, you can exchange vows indoors.
  * **You’ll find the perfect space for each phase of your event.** The dazzling Prince William Ballroom is just one of 13 elegant banquet and reception rooms that range in size from small and cozy for an intimate gathering to large enough for a hundred or more friends and relatives.
  * **Five wedding reception packages cater to your needs** , with vegetarian and kosher options, a children’s menu and a variety of enhancements. And in case you’d like to host a rehearsal dinner and brunch the day after the festivities, their Wedding Weekend Package has that covered!
