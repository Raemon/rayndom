## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set along the Hudson River and boasting breathtaking Manhattan skyline views,** this handsomely designed restaurant features flexible, open event spaces and a contemporary Italian menu highlighting fresh, local seafood. 
  * **In the stellar Main Dining Room, you’ll find a warm, open look,** with elements of wood and brick, exposed rafters, and vintage industrial-style lighting. Floor-to-ceiling windows wrap the room, and open to a wraparound deck that allows for dockside dining and mingling. 
  * **The Wine Cellar or Lounge are perfect for smaller celebrations—** both have the same chic styling you’ll find throughout Battello, with a cozier, more intimate vibe just right for a private dinner or cocktail reception.
