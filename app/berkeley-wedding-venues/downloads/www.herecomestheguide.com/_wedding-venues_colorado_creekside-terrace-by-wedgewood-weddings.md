## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked away on 8 picturesque acres of countryside, this charming farmhouse-inspired venue offers captivating woodland views and tons of flexibility:** Arrange your celebration throughout the variety of indoor and outdoor spaces, each with their own version of Colorado rustic-elegance.
  * **The ceremony garden is just lovely, with a quaint wooden pergola** **sheltered by the branches of mature oaks.** Cocktail hours unfold on either the Fireside Courtyard (the names says it all!) or the handsome Foyer. Al fresco receptions are so romantic in the beautifully lit Pavilion, an open-walled tent surrounded by natural landscaping accented with rocks and earthy foliage. 
  * **The Grand Hall, with its soaring ceiling** **and light hardwood flooring, has a sliding barn-style door that can be left open to frame the scenery.** Upstairs, the Loft's open rafters and white walls lend a modern-rustic flair to indoor ceremonies. With Creekside Terrace's many customizable venue and wedding package options, you'll be grateful for the experienced guidance of the Wedgewood Weddings team--they'll work with you to craft the special day you envision.
