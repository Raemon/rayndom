## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Pristine rolling hills studded with palm trees** define the two world-class, four-star courses at this legendary golf club. Inside, the elegantly styled Crisp Room provides an effortlessly romantic backdrop for your reception.
  * **The wooden pergola beside a sparkling lake** makes a gorgeous outdoor ceremony site. For your cocktail hour, guests can mingle in the lounge or on the veranda overlooking the 18th fairway and water feature.
  * **Private dressing suites** allow the wedding parties to prep and relax in between events. And with the exclusive on-site catering as well as inclusions such as tables, chairs, and linens, planning and coordination is seamless.
