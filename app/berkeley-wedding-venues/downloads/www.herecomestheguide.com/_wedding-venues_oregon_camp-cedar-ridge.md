## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on 32 acres of deeply wooded coastal range forest,** this historic camp offers a secluded, naturally beautiful spot for your full weekend celebration…and it’s just a quick 45 minutes from the heart of Portland.
  * **Exchange vows in a lovely amphitheater,** set in a clearing surrounded by towering pines. The camp is stocked with plenty of yard games to make your cocktail hour extra festive, and receptions are a dream in the rustic-chic, peak-roofed barn. 
  * **Because its a fully equipped overnight camp,** there’s lots of room for guests to stay the weekend, and tons of opportunities for memory-making, including a pool, horseshoe pits, and even a 300-foot slip-and-slide!
