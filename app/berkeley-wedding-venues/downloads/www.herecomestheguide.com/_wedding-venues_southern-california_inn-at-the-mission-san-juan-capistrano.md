## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **History meets luxury at this gorgeous resort** set beside the iconic Mission San Juan Capistrano, with views of its dramatic arches and the ruins of the Great Stone Church. Hacienda-style guest rooms, suites, and luxury villas provide a welcoming retreat, each beautifully crafted with high ceilings, thick corbel beams, grand armoires, and beautiful chandeliers. 
  * **The stunning Mission-inspired Landmark Courtyard is the Inn's dynamic centerpiece.** Lined on two sides by airy, stone-columned arcades, a stucco wall on one end is accented by a sculptural olive tree and clinging vines to create a stunning backdrop for "I do"s. The spacious Los Olivos Room is another lovely option, with beautiful French doors that open onto an adjacent courtyard with twinkle light-wrapped fruit trees to make an especially romantic scene.
  * **The all-inclusive packages offer a feast for the senses,** pairing expert Marriott-certified planners with curated menus featuring fresh, creative SoCal cuisine infused with Spanish flavors. While the chefs are well-versed in preparing a wide variety of dishes to meet religious and cultural needs, you also have the option to work with an outside caterer—in other words, you'll get exactly what you need.
