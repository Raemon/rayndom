## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **An iconic Los Angeles landmark, this 1924 filming location and event venue** is a true masterpiece of style and craftsmanship. It's also an incredibly flexible space—you'll have the freedom to choose all your own vendors, including catering (though their in-house caterer is exceptional), and even the crystals in the chandeliers can be removed if that better fits your vision.
  * **The grand Majestic Hall is a stunner, with 30-foot Italian ceilings** , arched windows, sculpted marble columns and original marble floors that lend a sense of history to any event. Its three distinct spaces can be divided for smaller gatherings or combined into one dramatic space, offering nearly 20,000 square feet to play with.
  * **Two additional event spaces each deliver their own unique vibe.** The Catwalk exudes a modern-industrial style, with its centerpiece catwalk linking various platforms to create a multi-level experience. The Reserve, a nightlife-inspired space, is fully equipped for a party, with three full bars, two DJ booths, dance floor lighting, custom LED packages, and more!
