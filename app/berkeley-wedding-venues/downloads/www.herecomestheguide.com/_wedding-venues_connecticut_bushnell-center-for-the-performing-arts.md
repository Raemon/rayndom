## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's dramatic.** The Autorino Great Hall is completely enclosed in glass, and features a gable-vaulted ceiling soaring 35 feet above the floor. A one-of-a-kind glass chandelier designed by famed artist Dale Chihuly is the space's most arresting element.
  * **You have a choice of beautiful event spaces.** Hand-carved woodwork, lovely chandeliers and a chamber stage distinguish the Seaversn Room, which also comes with a baby grand piano and outdoor terrace. The refined, third-floor Harace Bushnell Suite overlooks the Great Hall, while the intimate Belding Stage features a stunning "Music of the Spheres" mural overhead. In Mortensen Hall you'll find a striking Art Deco interior.
  * **It's conveniently located in downtown Hartford** , and the innovative event staff will help you plan your celebration. They offer audiovisual support plus in-house event cuisine provided by _Max's Catering_ —and if you're a subscriber you'll save 10% on all reception space rentals!
