## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Let the towering white event barn serve as the backdrop** for a dramatic outdoor ceremony, or gather a small group of your nearest and dearest to witness your vows in a peaceful forest clearing. 
  * **That barn? It's really incredible** , with an open-rafter ceiling that soars to a dizzying height, loads of oversized windows filling the space with light, and rows of glass double-doors that open onto a spacious lawn and terrace. 
  * **You'll spend your day-of prep time in the charming Bridal Suite** , which boasts a lounge area, hair and makeup stations, and a private dressing room. Meanwhile, the guys will set up shop in a super-cool vintage Airstream trailer. (Nobody said you couldn't trade places, though!)
