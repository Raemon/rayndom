## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set at the center of Sunriver,** a nature-friendly residential and-resort community just outside Bend, this rustic-modern event center features indoor and outdoor spaces that highlight the resort’s richly forested surroundings. 
  * **Benham Hall boasts a contemporary, Pacific Northwest-inspired design,** with a soaring, vaulted ceiling, cheerful white-toned walls, and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking lush Paulina Park. It can be easily divided into two smaller rooms for intimate affairs. 
  * **Nearby accommodations are a snap to find,** with ample vacation rentals available throughout the resort. We recommend booking a day pass with your loved ones to enjoy hours of fun at SHARC's sprawling aquatics center, which offers pools, splash pads, water slides, and (our favorite!) a lazy river.
