## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Best known as the state’s #1 ski resort,** this Northwoods destination is also a fabulous spot for all-season weddings. Nestled in the Superior National Forest, al fresco gatherings are graced by soaring pines, verdant fairways, and two sparkling lakes, with over 5,000 square feet of flexible indoor gathering space providing even more stunning options.
  * **Exchange vows at the Quarry Overlook,** perched at the edge of the pristine lake**** with sweeping, unobstructed vistas of the lush forests and dramatic rock faces of the Embarrass Mine Pit. Or, opt for a ceremony among the trees, on a sun-kissed hillside, or in a lovely landscaped courtyard. Receptions follow in the stylish main Chalet, where walls of windows bring the scenic surroundings in.
  * **Approachable, affordable pricing and lots of included amenities****—** like on-site lodging and customizable menus—make this a smart pick for couples seeking a smooth, stress-free process that won’t break the bank. Best of all is the wonderful event staff, who receive rave reviews for their warmth, flexibility, and responsiveness.
