## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This historic, multi-use estate sits on ten acres of verdant meadows and forests** along the Little Quilcene River on the Olympic Peninsula. Serving as a park, community space, vacation getaway, and museum, it’s a truly special destination with a convenient, Seattle-adjacent location. 
  * **The open meadow welcomes ceremonies, cocktails, and receptions** to take place in one beautiful area, and its “Linger Longer Stage” provides shelter for vows and live music. Old growth cedar and Douglas fir trees dot the property, and photo opportunities abound along the hiking trails, river, pond, bridges, and vintage buildings. 
  * **A graceful 1890s Victorian mansion** is available for day-of preparations, overnight accommodations (it boasts four bedrooms), and also serves as a wonderful spot for elopements and micro-weddings…we especially love the idea of intimate vows in front of the fireplace or in the cozy library.
