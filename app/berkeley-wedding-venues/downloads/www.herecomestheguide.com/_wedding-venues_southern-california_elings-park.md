## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Blessed with exquisite city, mountain, and ocean views, this gorgeous nonprofit park** is a true hidden gem in vibrant Santa Barbara. With three romantic event spaces set among its 230 acres, this spectacular, unspoiled setting can be styled as elegantly as you please, but you really don’t need to add a single flower, plant or ribbon because Nature has provided all the decoration.
  * **Ceremonies may unfold in the Grove’s secluded stone amphitheater,** gently terraced into the hillside overlooking a forest of oaks and blissfully quiet, save for the soft rustling of leaves and the occasional trill of birdsong. Celebrations easily flow on the adjacent reception deck, a freeform redwood expanse tucked among gnarled oaks at the edge of a plateau.
  * **The centerpiece of the expansive Singleton Pavilion is a gracious sweep of lawn,** from which you can enjoy serene city and mountain vistas. At one end, a copse of trees on a slight rise makes a leafy milieu for exchanging vows; or say “I do” in front of a handsome gazebo at the opposite end. A circling path leads to a stone terrace, where a petite grove of saplings creates a magical atmosphere for intimate dining and novel cocktail hours.
