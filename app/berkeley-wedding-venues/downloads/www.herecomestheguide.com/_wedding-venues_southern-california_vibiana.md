## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This exquisite 1876 cathedral-turned-event space is a treasure** in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, and one of its few remaining 19th-century landmarks. Now operated by the dynamic Amy Knoll Fraser and Chef Neal Fraser, you can expect a chef-driven, guest-first experience that will take your breath away.
  * **The Main Hall retains it original grandeur,** with soaring marble columns, ornately coffered 45-foot ceilings, and walls of Palladian windows. Or, celebrate al fresco in the Italian-inspired courtyard, with an olive tree-lined perimeter, fragrant beds of herbs, and glowing market lights that mingle with the stars and sparkling city as the sun sets.
  * **The award-winning food & beverage programs showcase modern American cuisine** influenced by the flavors of the city’s diverse legacy. Chef Fraser’s culinary expertise is truly boundless, and menus are custom-crafted to your taste— anything from upscale wood-fired pizzas to multi-course cultural feasts… or both! Extensive craft libations, well-rounded wine lists, and a seasoned and talented in-house event staff round out the exceptional packages.
