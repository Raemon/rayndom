## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Wide open natural spaces and gorgeous Rocky Mountain views are everywhere** at this rustic, romantic events venue, which is nestled on the grounds of a real working dude ranch...it doesn't get any more "Colorado" than that!
  * **The raised Gazebo is perched at the edge of a reflecting pond** , and features decorative doors and arches reminiscent of a quaint front porch. After your vows, move to the two-story Carriage House, whose sides can be opened to reveal views of the gardens. 
  * **Intimate elopements and "micro-weddings" in the Labyrinth Garden** are deeply meaningful—you and your partner enter from opposite sides, winding your way through the double spiral to exchange vows at the maze's center.
