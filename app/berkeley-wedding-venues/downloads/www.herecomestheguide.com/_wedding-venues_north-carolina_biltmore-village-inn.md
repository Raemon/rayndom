## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This beautiful hilltop Queen Anne B &B** features a unique turret and inviting wraparound porch, as well as sweeping views of the Blue Ridge Mountains and Swannanoa River Valley.
  * **Say "I do" in the shade of the romantic pergola,** with the distant mountains as your backdrop. Then (depending on the size of your guest list), follow with a simple, elegant tea sandwich and canapé reception, or seated dinner beneath stars. 
  * **Intimate weddings and elopements are their specialty.** They offer unique packages just for your private or micro-wedding, with optional useful add-ons like in-room hair and makeup services.
