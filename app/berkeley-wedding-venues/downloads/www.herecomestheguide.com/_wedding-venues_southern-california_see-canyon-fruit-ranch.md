## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Hidden away in a beautiful canyon just five minutes from the beach,** you'll find this lush family-owned oasis, bursting with mature oaks and gentle ferns, heavenly gardens, vintage barn buildings, and vibrant apple orchards. 
  * **At the heart of the property is an expansive lawn,** nestled among shady evergreens, diverse greenery, and soaring oaks for a true "secret garden" feel. Exchange vows here, then join your guests for a cocktail beneath the shade sails on the Upper Bar and a round of cornhole on the adjacent green before returning to the lawn for dinner & dancing.
  * **With a 20-year legacy of hosting beautiful weddings,** the family behind this Central Coast gem will immediately make you feel right at home. Their generous open vendor policy provides you plenty of flexibility to customize your day, but they're also happy to share their recommendations and expertise.
