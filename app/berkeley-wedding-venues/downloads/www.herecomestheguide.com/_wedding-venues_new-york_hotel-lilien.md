## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Making the most of its stunning Catskills location,** this historic estate’s design ensures views of its lushly forested surroundings all throughout its grounds. The meticulously restored interior beckons guests to settle in for a cozy afternoon in the library or an evening snuggled beside the wood stove. 
  * **Inside, you’ll find intimate, inviting spaces for all phases of small gatherings,** with outdoor options on the deck and pool terrace. An expansive side lawn nestled in the woods invites grand tented or open-air affairs.
  * **There are eighteen beautifully curated rooms for you and your guests,** including a bunk room and large suite for family groups. The in-house lounge is open year-round for cocktails and nibbles, and the homey private dining room makes a fun option for your rehearsal dinner.
