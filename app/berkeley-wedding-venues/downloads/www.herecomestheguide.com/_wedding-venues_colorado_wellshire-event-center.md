## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Charming, historic inn:** Located on the Wellshire Golf Course, only 10 minutes from downtown Denver, this stately event center with spectacular views of the Rocky Mountains has been hosting weddings since 1926.
  * **Beautifully preserved rooms:** The Onyx Lounge features a barrel-vaulted high-beamed ceiling, an original belt-driven elephant-ear fan, ornate social tables, and a gas fireplace…and it adjoins the capacious Cambridge Room. The glass-walled Mountain View Pavilion offers stunning vistas and has a private patio overlooking the 18th fairway. 
  * **On-site, full-time wedding event managers** see to the hundreds of little details that go into making your day perfect. The staff will provide a tailored experience and can coordinate anything from special lighting to kosher meals and horse-drawn carriages.
