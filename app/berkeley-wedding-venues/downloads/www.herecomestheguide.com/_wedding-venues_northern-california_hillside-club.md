## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Housed in an immaculate 1920s-era hall,** this community-focused club has worked towards its mission of supporting community, culture, and the arts since the late 19th century. Today, the space plays host to events of all kinds, from concerts to wine tastings to truly lovely weddings.
  * **Taking its design inspiration from the Arts & Crafts movement,** the building is a true historic gem nestled in a quiet residential neighborhood. The main event space exemplifies the simple elegance of the style, with rich wood wainscoting, glowing Old World-style chandeliers, and soaring multi-paned windows that flood the room with natural light. 
  * **Exchange vows on the raised stage, framed by a gracious wood proscenium** and opulent draped curtain, or say "I do" before a lovely built-in fireplace, accented by two custom stained glass panels. Both are also excellent spots for your sweetheart table or cake—but you'll want to make sure you've got some space: the wood floor is perfect for dancing.
