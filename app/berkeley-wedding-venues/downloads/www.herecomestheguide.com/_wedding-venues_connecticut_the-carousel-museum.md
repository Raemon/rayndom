## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Housed in a**lovingly****restored****1901 post-and-beam** factory,** this fascinating museum allows guests to step back in time as they marvel at over 100 years of carousel art and history—intricately carved animals and chariots, art pieces, and memorabilia from the days when the carousel was the "pinnacle of amusement park joy".
  * **Say "I do" in The Main Gallery** surrounded by a collection of hundreds of antique treasures. Once you're wed, you can continue the party here, or move upstairs to the charming ballroom, with its ample dance floor and sparkling Venetian crystal chandeliers. 
  * **Your reasonably-priced rental fee** allows you to select the caterer and vendors of your choice, and includes rides on the wonderful antique Venetian carousel. Best yet, all fees help support the Museum's mission to preserve and restore these unique works of art for future generations.
