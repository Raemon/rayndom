## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This romantic Vermont inn** **in the Mad River Valley** specializes in elopements and petite weddings, each thoughtfully curated by expert in-house planners. You might exchange vows in the colorful garden, illuminated by glowing bistro lights, in front of a roaring fire as the snow falls, or in a classic New England chapel located just steps away.
  * **Your custom farm-to-table dinner menu is served in the elegant dining room,** which can be styled to match your vision, whether that’s elevated sophistication or casual warmth. The welcoming Tracks tavern is another option, along with an intimate wine cellar perfect for toasting your nuptials.
  * **The inn’s whimsical guest rooms are each uniquely themed,** ranging from rustic woodlands to refined elegance, so you and your nearest and dearest can linger in style. You’ll be perfectly placed to explore the region’s extensive year-round activities, from cold-weather skiing to autumnal cider tastings to sun-kissed hot-air balloon rides.
