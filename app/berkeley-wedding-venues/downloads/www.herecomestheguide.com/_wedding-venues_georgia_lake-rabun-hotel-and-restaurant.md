## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This welcoming, rustic retreat is truly special,** nestled in the heart of the North Georgia mountains on lushly wooded grounds overlooking Lake Rabun.
  * **The Forest Lodge is a beautiful, nature-inspired venue** for dreamy mountain nuptials. Exchange vows beside in the airy, timber-frame pavilion, surrounded by the grandeur of the lush woods and gardens. Intimate celebrations are lovely in the restaurant, with its rustic wood construction and two spacious decks nestled among the trees.
  * **Guests can stay the weekend in the delightful hotel** or just down the road at Fish Camp's cute cottages. Your event staff is happy to help you arrange adventures: boating, horseback riding, golf, hiking, zip-lining...how to choose? Better extend your departure date by a few days!
