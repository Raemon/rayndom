## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Boasting not one, but three impressive waterfalls, this gracious venue** provides multiple stunning backdrops for your nuptials. Generous all-inclusive packages make the planning process easy, with delicious catering and bar services customized to match your preferences. Plus, there are no room rental fees!
  * **Two exquisite al fresco ceremony sites beckon:** choose from the amphitheater-style pergola overlooking the lake, or the oak-shaded ceremony lawn, backed by cascading waterfalls. After the "I do"s, gather on the airy breezeway, balcony, or the plush lawn for a champagne toast and passed nibbles.
  * **Join your guests for dinner and dancing in the gorgeous Ivy Ballroom,** which boasts floor-to-ceiling windows framing spectacular views of the Temescal Valley and the 9th hole. Its open concept layout encourages an indoor-outdoor flow—with the added benefit of year-round climate control.
