_If you had to postpone or cancel your wedding, but still want to commemorate your original date, we've got you! Here are 8 ideas to honor the OG wedding day._

* * *

## Break out the Old Photos

If there were ever a time to reminisce about your relationship, today's the day! Use your would-have-been wedding date to remember how it all began. Go through old photos, read those old love notes or emails you saved, and laugh about the stories of how the two of you met or began your courtship. And of course, take the time to remind your partner what it is you love about them. Use your original date to fall in love all over again.

## Plan a Stay-at-home Soirée

Temporarily ditch all your stress and anxiety in favor of a romantic at-home date night. Pull out all the stops: Get dressed to the nines, make a fancy dinner, pop a bottle of champagne, turn on the music, and dance under the stars. It's a fabulous way to reconnect with your partner and, even amidst all this craziness and uncertainty, to remember that love ALWAYS wins.

## Have a Self-Care Staycation

Take a bubble bath (together or separately!), do a luxurious face or hair mask, make yummy spa water, and give each other pedicures or massages! You two deserve to be pampered after this whirlwind wedding journey—so throw on those fuzzy bathrobes and slippers, put some cucumber slices on your eyes, lay back, and act like you're honeymooning at the Ritz.

## Have Your Cake (and eat it, too)

Order a small cutting cake from your wedding cake maker (or whip one up yourself if you love to bake!) and cut the cake with your fiancé. Feed each other a bite, smash it in each others' faces if that's your thing, and indulge in a sweet treat to commemorate your original date. You deserve it.

## Embrace Plan B

If you've been in a state of shock or denial this whole time, perhaps take your "original" wedding date as a fresh start. Accept that your Plan A isn't going to happen, start shifting your mindset to a more positive outlook, and embrace a new Plan B. Take the day to start from scratch and figure out how a reimagined wedding day could look. Find the silver linings, use your imagination, and spend the day planning the 2.0 version of your big day with that fine fiancé.

## Support Your Vendors

Even if you've rescheduled your wedding, you may still be unable to work with some or all of your vendors on a future date. Why not take your original wedding date to show them some love? Order a colorful centerpiece from your floral designer, cupcakes from your bakery, and a pick-up dinner from your caterer. We're willing to bet most of your vendor team is comprised of small local businesses, so they would absolutely appreciate the love and support.

## Give Yourself Permission

To laugh, to cry, to take action, or do nothing at all. If you want to sit on the couch with your fiancé and binge watch Netflix all day, do it! If you want to put together some sort of celebration to pay tribute to the day, do it! But don't feel like you have to. This pandemic was a serious blow to your wedding vision, and it's okay to feel the feels. How you spend the "original" date is up to you and no one else.

## Open Presents

If you registered, chances are you have a pile of wedding gifts at your house by now. Open those babies up! It IS your wedding date, after all.
