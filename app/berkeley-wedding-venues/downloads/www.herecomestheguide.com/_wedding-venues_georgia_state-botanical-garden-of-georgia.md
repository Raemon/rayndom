## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With acres of bountiful gardens dotted with artfully designed buildings,** this unique botanical garden—operated by the University of Georgia—celebrates the natural horticultural heritage of the South. An added perk: your rental fees help support its mission of education and ecological stewardship. 
  * **Designed to blend with its surrounding of hardwood trees,** the Cecil B. Day Chapel is a striking architectural gem, with an impressive cathedral ceiling, intricate detailing of carved wood and glass, and huge windows that let in the light and views of the forest. 
  * **Host an unforgettable celebration in the dazzling Great Room.** Housing the Garden’s collection of lush tropical plants, trees, and flowers, this all-glass structure boasts a soaring ceiling and exquisite light…especially after sunset.
