## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Showcasing 360-degree views of Sedona's famous Red Rocks** , this sky-high restaurant treats guests to absolutely killer sunsets. So enjoy the quiet grandeur then let the party begin, because it's the only local venue with no noise restrictions.
  * **If nature's beauty isn't picturesque enough as a backdrop** for your outdoor ceremony or reception, feel free to incorporate some antique planes into your portraits. Prefer dining indoors? Savor the gorgeous vistas through Mesa Grill's huge windows.
  * **Chef Mercer Mohr's San Francisco-style cuisine can be customized** to accommodate your budget and dietary requests, like vegetarian, gluten-free, and vegan. Plus, their friendly staff prides itself on exceptional service.
