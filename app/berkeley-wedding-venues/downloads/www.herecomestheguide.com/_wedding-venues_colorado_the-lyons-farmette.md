## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Sweet and perfectly picturesque,** this boutique flower farm is nestled near the St. Vrain river and boasts four acres of colorful flower fields and vegetable gardens that are used to provide the bounty and décor for wedding celebrations at the Farm. 
  * **Graceful cottonwood trees provide shade for vows on the lawn,** which can also accommodate lawn games and al fresco dining. A gorgeous modern wood barn can host receptions in any season, with ample room for dinner and dancing. 
  * **They offer so many fun extras, like a quaint farmhouse** and a vintage Airstream trailer to serve as individual dressing areas for the wedding parties, a cute 1954 Chevy truck for photos, a bonfire spot, and some very friendly (and photogenic) chickens and goats.
