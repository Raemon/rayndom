## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This stately 1856 mansion, an icon in the town of Jefferson for nearly two centuries,** sits proudly on a verdant hilltop. A private home for most of its history, now its doors have been opened for the first time, welcoming couples who are seeking a one-of-a-kind setting to bring their love story to life.
  * **Exquisitely preserved historic interiors are augmented with moody, maximalist details** to create a vibe that’s unique, bold, and truly unforgettable. Each room is designed for drama, with large scale wallpaper and black-and-white murals, crystal chandeliers around every corner, original wood fireplace mantles, and vintage furnishings throughout.
  * **Every celebration enjoys exclusive access to the mansion** and surrounding property, ensuring you never feel rushed. Weekend-long Friday through Sunday rentals are especially popular, with the option for the couple and up to seven loved ones to stay overnight in the plush accommodations.
