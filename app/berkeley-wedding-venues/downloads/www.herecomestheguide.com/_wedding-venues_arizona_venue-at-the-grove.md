## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A leafy grove of pecan trees makes a lush backdrop for your ceremony** on a velvety lawn. Continue your celebration under the stars with a reception on their large brick patio.
  * **When the sun sets and darkness falls, jaws will drop** as acres of surrounding trees are lit up with the glow of 40,000 twinkle lights. Now that even gives a shooting star a run for its money!
  * **Their rustic-chic indoor reception hall features lovely views** and French doors that open to the evening breeze. It's hard to believe this refined ranch is just minutes from downtown Phoenix.
