## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You'll find endless photo opportunities** in this 60-acre botanic garden, such as the Lotus Pond, the Log Cabin, the Dogwood Meadow, and the Peirce Celebration Garden, which features a stone wall adorned with flowers and greenery.
  * **The gracious, climate-controlled Davidson Event Center** is an 1870s-era barn with rustic chandeliers and a wall of windows offering views of the surrounding woodlands. The adjacent plaza provides a spacious area for dining, dancing, and mingling.
  * **Two changing rooms** make on-site wedding party prep seamless. Other amenities that come with the site rental include a day-of event manager, who can coordinate both the rehearsal and the ceremony, and a stone fireplace with complimentary wood.
