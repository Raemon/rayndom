## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This classically romantic Jeffersonian manor** , set on a 23-acre estate in the rolling hills of northern Virginia's wine country, features a stunning brick façade with impressive columns and a picturesque second-floor balcony overlooking the front lawn.
  * **Historically authentic and unimpeachably elegant** , the Grand Ballroom will transport you to another time. Sparkling chandeliers hang from the 24-foot ceiling, and delicate glass wall sconces create a welcoming glow.
  * **The red Brick Patio offers plenty of room to mingle outside** , with the manor as a lovely backdrop. At the other end, a white pergola with gorgeous views of the manicured grounds provides an excellent al fresco ceremony location.
