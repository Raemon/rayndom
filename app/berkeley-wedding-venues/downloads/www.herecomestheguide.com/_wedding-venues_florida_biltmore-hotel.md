## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **They offer a variety of lovely indoor and outdoor spaces.** Lofty arches…rich wood paneling…lighting to fit your mood…delicately draped gauze…lush greenery…romantic gardens. From its 150 acres of beautiful landscaping to its elegant ballrooms, the peach-and-white Biltmore exudes a Mediterranean feel and historic charm.
  * **You can create your own custom-designed wedding package with help from their wedding specialists.** Add enhancements like a poolside welcome reception with Miami Mojitos and local cuisine, or a spa day for the girls and a golf outing for the guys. They also have a selection of Intimate Wedding packages.
  * **It’s the perfect place to plan a wedding weekend.** Each opulently appointed guest room and suite has oversized picture windows with views of the golf course, pool, or city of Coral Gables. And, there’s something for everyone to do: Get energized with a group Zumba class or personal training session, take some quiet time in the yoga studio, enjoy afternoon tea in the lobby, or savor a drink in the Cellar Club or Biltmore Bar.
