## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's the perfect Hill Country setting with a natural, homey feel** , nestled in a lovely valley near Upper Cibolo Creek. Though it's just a 40-minute drive from San Antonio, deer and other local wildlife are often seen around the property's gently rolling hills and meadows.
  * **Follow a path across a stone footbridge to your ceremony site** —a peaked, wooden pergola at the edge of an expansive lawn with unobstructed views of the surrounding woodlands.
  * **Celebrate in the classic, country-style reception hall** , with rich oak hardwood floors, a built-in stage, open-trussed ceiling, and wraparound porch.
