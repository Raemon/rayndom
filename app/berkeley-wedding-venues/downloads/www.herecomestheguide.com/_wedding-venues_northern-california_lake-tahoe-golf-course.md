## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Experience why Lake Tahoe is widely considered one of the most romantic places on earth** at this sought-after golf course, set in a picturesque mountain meadow in South Lake Tahoe. Breathtaking alpine views, impeccable service, and beautiful landscaped grounds combine for a truly spectacular celebration.
  * **Exchange your vows on the scenic 10th tee,** overlooking the winding Upper Truckee River. Perfectly set with wrought-iron or wood wedding arbor and elegant mahogany chairs, it's a stunning backdrop for your vows—and for memorable photos you'll treasure for years to come.
  * **Large windows in the modern clubhouse showcase panoramic views of Mt. Tallac,** the pine-studded Sierra Nevada mountains, and the surrounding course. Here, you'll enjoy delicious menus carefully tailored to your tastes by the in-house chef and dancing into the night beneath sparkling chandeliers.
