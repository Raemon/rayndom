  * **Family owned and operated since the 1930s, this picturesque club** is the ultimate setting for an elegant celebration. The grounds are meticulously maintained and showcase the area’s natural beauty with lush greenery and colorful flowers.
  * **Tie the knot beside a sparkling lake with a fountain cascading behind you** , or beneath a charming white pergola in a courtyard framed by exquisite blooms and a greenery-draped trellised altar.
  * **The airy reception rooms boast floor-to-ceiling windows** that frame lovely views of the surrounding golf greens, flower beds, and lush landscaping. Adjacent patios, warmly lit with bistro lights, offer a fabulous option for an al fresco cocktail hour.
