## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on nearly 200 acres of Montrose’s Western Slope,** this ranch features breathtaking views of the windswept plains, and a stunning panorama that includes Mount Sneffels, Buckhorn, and the San Juan Range.
  * **Let the dramatic mountain ridges and peaks** **provide the backdrop for your meadow ceremony.** Then, shift the celebration to the beautiful rustic-modern barn, with its vaulted cathedral ceiling, romantic chandelier and string lighting, and wood sourced from historic barns.
  * **You can host your wedding at any time of year,** thanks to the barn’s state-of-the-art climate controls. Their open vendor policy ensures you’ll have exactly the party you’ve been dreaming of, and the all-day, on-site assistance of their awesome staff allows you hand over the reins and focus on the fun.
