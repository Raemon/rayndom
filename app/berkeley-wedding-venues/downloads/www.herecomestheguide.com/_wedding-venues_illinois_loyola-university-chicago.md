## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **An abundance of venues across two campuses (Lake Shore and**[**Water Tower**](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/illinois/loyola-university-chicago-water-tower-campus)**) showcase different styles,** meaning it won't be hard to find the right fit. At the Lake Shore campus, you'll be treated to the sparkling waters of Lake Michigan as your breathtaking backdrop. Receptions are gorgeous in the Crown Center Lobby; its gracious open-plan space includes a wall of floor-to-ceiling windows for those fabulous views, and an adjacent patio creates a lovely indoor/outdoor flow. 
  * **The beautifully restored Mundelein Center boasts two venues with historic touches** and plenty of windows to highlight the stunning views; the sky-high ceilings and soaring stained glass panes of Jo Ann Rooney Hall exude Art Deco glam, while the Palm Court, a stunning 4th-floor atrium with a wraparound terrace, is perfect for intimate celebrations.
  * **Delicious gourmet cuisine is provided by Loyola’s exclusive caterer.** A tasting for four is included in every package, ensuring you'll find the right options for your event; add-ons like late night bites (we're partial to the mini Chicago dogs) are a fun way to personalize your menu.
