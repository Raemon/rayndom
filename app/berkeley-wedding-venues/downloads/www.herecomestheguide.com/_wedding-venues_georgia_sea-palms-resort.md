## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled at the heart of desirable St. Simons Island** , this peaceful retreat boasts everything you could want in a wedding weekend destination—outstanding service, tons of activities, a gorgeous setting, and experienced event staff who will make the planning process a piece of (wedding) cake. Plus, it's easily accessible from both Savannah and Jacksonville regional airports.
  * **Say "I do" under the branches of Spanish moss-laden oaks** or on the steps of a peak-roofed lakeside gazebo, followed by cocktails on the putting green or the Pool Yard. Al fresco receptions are lovely at the chic, marshside Square 67 space, or, move the party inside to one of the beautifully appointed ballrooms. Either way, you and your guests will enjoy delectable menus from the experienced on-site catering team.
  * **They have plentiful luxe on-site accommodations** on the secluded, marshy north side of St. Simon's Island, and all guests have access to their on-site restaurant & bar, Sago at Sea Palms, fitness center, pool and tiki bar, and 18-hole championship golf course. It's also the only wedding venue on the island that includes two dedicated getting ready spaces: the Dogwood and Magnolia Suites.
