  * **Designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry** , with 199 windows in an undulating stainless-steel canopy, this breathtaking and unique space is the ideal location for a chic, modern wedding.
  * **An outdoor celebration in the serene Reflections Garden** provides a view of both the building’s iconic roof and the peaceful natural scenery.
  * **When you host your celebration here, you help preserve the memory of others.** Event proceeds benefit the nonprofit organization Keep Memory Alive and go to the research, treatment, and clinical studies of neurological disorders at the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health.
