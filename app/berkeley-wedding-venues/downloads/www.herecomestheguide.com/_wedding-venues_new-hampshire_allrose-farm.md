## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its quintessential New Hampshire countryside surroundings** and picturesque antique buildings, this lovely spot offers relaxed, romantic spaces to gather with your dearest ones, and is owned and operated by a husband and wife team who put thought and care into ensuring celebrations here are both meaningful and affordable. 
  * **Wed in the gardens, with their bountiful foliage and quaint stone walls,** then move to the historic barn, whose cozy, vintage vibe is accented by delicate chandeliers, original wood beams and flooring, and a working, two-story fireplace. 
  * **Let sister company Woodland Honey Catering Company** provide an unforgettable, farmhouse-inspired menu to match the rustic-elegant feel of the property, while Moments to Remember, the estate’s event planning partner, helps take care of details large and small.
