## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Overlooking the entire Prescott Valley from its mountaintop perch,** this locally owned, full-service resort (the only one of its kind in the area) features stunning vistas, fine dining, a spa, and inspiring design influenced by the traditional art of the Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe.
  * **Your venue choices include a sweeping terrace that offers views across the valley toward the mountains,** a grand, contemporary ballroom, and two distinct, light-filled spaces for intimate celebrations. 
  * **Boasting chic, Southwestern-inspired furnishings and private balconies in each hotel suite,** your guests will feel both comforted and pampered in the resort's on-site lodging. And with 160 rooms on site, everyone in your group can be accommodated.
