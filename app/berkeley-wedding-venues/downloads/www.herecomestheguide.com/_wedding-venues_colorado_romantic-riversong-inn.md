## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled along a rushing creek at the base of Rocky Mountains National Park,** this lovely inn began life in 1922 as a family summer retreat. It’s expanded over the years to include additional lodging, but retains 100% of its historic alpine charm.
  * **Walk the “wedding path” to your private, riverside ceremony area** for utterly idyllic vows. The inn’s intimate, all-season reception space is ideal for micro-weddings and elopements.
  * **Book the entire property for the weekend** so that you can fully enjoy this special estate (including the private Seven Benches Trail, with its handcrafted stone benches that each offer a different vantage point of the surrounding mountains and valley.)
