## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Sleek, chic and quite unique, this loft-style gem** offers a modern, sophisticated atmosphere while nestled on the 5th-floor of a historic, turn-of-the-century Classical Revival building.
  * **This bright and airy space is bathed in natural light** from floor-to-ceiling windows, offering amazing downtown views and a private outdoor balcony. Hardwood floors reflect the space's natural warmth, while a butler's pantry lets you prep a stylish celebration without ever having to leave the suite.
  * **This flexible venue is ideal for smaller weddings** as well as showers or rehearsals. 30 guests fit comfortably for a seated dinner, while 45 guests can mingle easily in a gracious standing reception.
