## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This lush three-acre property is just inside Marietta** so it's convenient for travelers and locals alike, while its secluded location offers total privacy and a timeless "secret garden" feel that's a rare treat. 
  * **Exchange vows beneath the beautiful wrought-iron gazebo** , as guests look on from an engraved patio surrounded by lit greenery and seasonal flowers. Afterward, they'll sip cocktails and mingle on the nearby stacked-stone terrace, then dance 'till the wee hours in the Grand Ballroom.
  * **À la carte pricing lets you design your own package,** and gives you the freedom to use your favorite vendors. Or, go with their all-inclusive option and leave every little detail to the pros so you can relax and enjoy the day.
