## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Vintage industrial charm abounds****at this newly re-envisioned spot** in the heart of Coatesville. Less than an hour from downtown Philadelphia, the town boasts plentiful lodging options and a great restaurant scene.
  * **Natural and whitewashed exposed brick adorn the walls** of the light-filled space. Accented by unique rustic light fixtures and a smooth concrete floor, it’s lovely as-is, but also serves as an ideal blank canvas for just about any décor style. 
  * **Packages range from fully catered affairs to simple ceremonies** and building-only rentals. There are no minimum guest or food requirements, and you’re welcome to use your chosen vendors, or opt for one of Casablanca’s trusted favorites.
