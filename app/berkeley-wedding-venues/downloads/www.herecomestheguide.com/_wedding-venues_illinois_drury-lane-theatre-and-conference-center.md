## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Blending timeless sophistication with modern luxury** , Drury Lane is the ultimate all-in-one venue. With over 35,000 square feet of event space and expert in-house coordinators to guide you every step of the way, you'll have no trouble bringing your dream wedding to life.
  * **The Grand and Crystal Ballrooms are opulent and refined** , each with lavish lighting, Swarovski crystal chandeliers, and plush drapery. For more intimate events, opt for the cozy English Room, which is centered around a stately fireplace, or the romantic, City of Love-inspired French Room.
  * **Packages are custom-curated to fit your taste and vision,** though each offering includes plenty of upscale details, like courtesy valet parking, white glove dinner service, and a complimentary wedding night suite for the newlyweds.
