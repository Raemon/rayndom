## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **There’s an utterly charming covered bridge leading to the gardens of this verdant mountaintop venue.** Only an hour from Litchfield County, Crystal Peak is surrounded by towering trees and offers a waterfall ceremony site and numerous photo op backdrops.
  * **You’ll find a winning combination of understated elegance and whimsy.** For example, the large Ballroom features crystal chandeliers hanging from a _trompe l’oeil_ ceiling of angels and the Lounge has hand-painted murals of clouds drifting by.
  * **Just reading the mouth-watering menu, you can tell the owner is a chef.** The choices are extensive and imaginative, with fresh ingredients that honor favorites and give them a twist. Plus, since each package offers multiple options, your guests can eat what they like.
