## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **Housed in a turn-of-the-century factory building bursting with character,** this ultra-cool Madison venue**** blends authentic industrial grit with modern luxury and topnotch amenities. All-inclusive packages keep the planning process smooth and simple, with experienced staff to guide you every step of the way.
  * **In the Atrium, double-height brick walls studded with original windows** create an airy, open vibe that invites creativity, with plenty of flexibility to play with configurations and customize your layout. You’ll also have access to the adjacent Private Lounge, with its lavish, illuminated built-in bar, and the expansive Public Lounge for cocktail hour.
  * **Custom menus crafted with fresh, local, and seasonal ingredients** are paired with generous, playful bar packages (ask about custom cocktails or housemade sodas!). There are plenty of in-house options for rentals and décor, too, giving you the freedom to bring your unique vision to life.
