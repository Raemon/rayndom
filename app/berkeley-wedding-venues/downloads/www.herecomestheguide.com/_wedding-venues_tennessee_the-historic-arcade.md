## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set on Lebanon’s quaint town square,** this turn-of-the-century gem is a lovely time capsule of early 1900s charm. An extensive restoration revealed and preserved its historic character, while adding all the amenities required for modern event success. 
  * **A stylish limestone arch adorns the Arcade’s façade,** which is crowned by three rows of oversized windows. Inside, you’ll find an open, light-filled central atrium whose soaring ceiling boasts skylights that run the entire length of the room, and a wonderful reception hall with exposed brick and original wood ceiling beams and flooring. 
  * **There’s a stylish, spacious dressing area****on site** **for your day-of prep,** outfitted with individual makeup stations and plenty of mirrors. You’ll also have access to a catering kitchen, ample on-site parking, and—most essentially—the help of the Arcade’s fantastic, experienced staff.
