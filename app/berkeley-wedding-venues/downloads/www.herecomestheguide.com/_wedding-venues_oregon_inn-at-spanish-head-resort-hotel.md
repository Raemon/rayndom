## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **As Oregon’s only resort hotel built right on the beach,** there’s nowhere else in the state that can offer an oceanfront wedding quite like this. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the El Toro Room frame stunning, panoramic views of the Pacific, and the Balboa Room, set at beach level, is perfect for intimate receptions.
  * **Exchange vows right on the sand,** with the crashing waves and endless horizon as your backdrop. Stay for a spell after the "I do"s to capture stunning golden hour photos as the sun dips towards the sea. 
  * **Entice your guests to stay all weekend long,** with spectacular oceanfront views from each and every guest room and plenty of nearby amenities to enjoy, including museums, galleries, scenic hiking trails, whale watching, and more.
