##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **This historic, red brick Georgian-style mansion** boasts beautiful crystal chandeliers, multiple fireplaces, and gorgeous antique furnishings and décor.
  * **Garden weddings are lovely amid the manicured grounds** , with blooming cherry trees, a lovely pond, and scenic trails. Set up a tent on the North Lawn and enjoy a panoramic view of the sprawling landscape.
  * **You can host your cocktail hour on the terrace** and then make use of the entire first floor of the house for an intimate reception. A private changing room on the second floor gives you a quiet place to relax and prepare.
