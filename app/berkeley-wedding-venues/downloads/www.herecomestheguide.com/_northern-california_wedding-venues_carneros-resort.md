## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Blending rustic charm and unpretentious luxury,****this one-of-a-kind resort** is nestled on 28 bucolic acres of rolling hills, grapevines, and unspoiled farmland. It's ideal for a relaxing wedding retreat: a trio of tempting on-site restaurants, a stylish pool and deck, and a tranquil Spa are just a few of the in-house amenities you and your guests can enjoy.
  * **A beautifully landscaped path leads through fragrant gardens to The Arbor,** the resort's premier ceremony site. Here, you'll say "I do" against a dramatic backdrop of Napa Valley vineyards and distant mountains, surrounded by plenty of photo-worthy enhancements like lush plantings, a water feature, and a charming trellis.
  * **The Carneros Courtyard is custom-made for outdoor gatherings.** Along with its spacious lawn and stone fireplace, it's wired for sound and has festival lighting. Inside, the Napa and Sonoma Ballrooms boast the clean, modern aesthetic that sets this place apart: both are outfitted soaring peaked roofs, handcrafted barn-board walls, and multiple sets of French doors.
