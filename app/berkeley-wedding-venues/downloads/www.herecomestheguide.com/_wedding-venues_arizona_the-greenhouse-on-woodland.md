## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **In the middle of the world’s largest Ponderosa Pine forest,** you’ll find this hidden White Mountains treasure boasting lush, artfully manicured gardens, inviting gathering spaces, and countless pretty photo spots, all nestled beneath a canopy of trees bedecked with twinkle lights. 
  * **Wed in the Secret Garden,** followed by games and mingling in the dedicated outdoor play area. Dinner and dancing take place in the newly renovated Reception Hall, which features a dance floor and wraparound porches. 
  * **You’ll find so many sweet and thoughtful touches** throughout the family-run venue, including a darling dressing suite, cozy fire pits, romantic lighting, and even a personalized engraved lock for you and your sweetheart to add to their custom “Locks of Love” arbor.
