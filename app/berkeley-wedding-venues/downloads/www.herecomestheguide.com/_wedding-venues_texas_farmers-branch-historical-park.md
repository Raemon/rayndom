## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled at the center of charming Farmers Branch Historical Park,** just fifteen minutes north of downtown Dallas, this wonderful living museum features beautifully preserved historic buildings in a lush, park setting. 
  * **Say your vows in the lovely little 1890s chapel,** followed by cocktails beneath the gazebo and on its surrounding patio. Then, move to the 1930s cottage-style Dodson House for your cozy, intimate reception.
  * **The grounds are just lovely,** with mature landscaping and lots of sweet details to make your photos extra-memorable, like an antique Texaco gas pump, vintage train caboose, and quaint log cabin.
