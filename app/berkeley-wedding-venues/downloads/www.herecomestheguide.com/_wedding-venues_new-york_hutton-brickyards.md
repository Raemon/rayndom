## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This luxurious escape on the Hudson River is made for destination wedding getaways.** Housed on the former site of an 1865 brickyard, you’ll find plenty of industrial-chic architecture along with diverse event spaces and striking, light-filled riverfront cabins —all surrounded by fragrant fields of wildflowers, tree-studded lawns, and the iconic river itself for a unique blend of natural beauty and authentic grit.
  * **Serene riverfront lawns and spacious covered pavilions are made for al fresco gatherings,** while the historic Hutton Hall is a magnificent indoor option, boasting massive wraparound windows, soaring ceilings, and cathedral-like acoustics. Or, opt to celebrate at Edgewood Mansion, a stunningly restored 1873 Second Empire-style manor set on a manicured hilltop**** that artfully blends original architectural details with exquisite modern accents.
  * **Bespoke, custom-curated celebrations are the specialty of the phenomenal events team,** who will work with you to bring your vision to life: from selecting your delicious, locally sourced menus, to planning spa & wellness experiences for the wedding party, to organizing unforgettable activities—everything from kayaking and archery to mixology classes and whiskey tastings.
