## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its clean-lined Spanish Mediterranean style and desert landscaping,** this chic clubhouse could be a villa in Palm Springs or along Spain’s Costa del Sol. Instead, it’s in upscale Anaheim Hills, a city of rolling knolls, pastoral vistas and cool valleys in the heart of central Orange County.
  * **Exchange vows on the breezy Terrace,** which overlooks the course’s rolling fairways, punctuated with stands of oaks and sycamores. A pair of columns provides a focal point, while a multitiered fountain adds Mediterranean flair. 
  * **The Grand Ballroom is truly impressive,** with a high, coffered ceiling, ironwork chandeliers, tied-back draperies, and a Byzantine-motif carpet that a sophisticated tone. Light flows in through three walls of floor-to-ceiling arched windows that also afford panoramic views of the golf course.
