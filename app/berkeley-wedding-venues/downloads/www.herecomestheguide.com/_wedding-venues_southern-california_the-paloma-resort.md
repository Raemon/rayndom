## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Blending Mission-inspired design with chic mid-century modern touches,** this boutique resort embodies the playful, fresh spirit of the Coachella Valley, with an ideal location just south of Downtown Palm Springs. Your guests will love the unique, vibrantly designed rooms, a sparkling pool, and Sol y Sombra, the renowned on-site restaurant, where Spanish-inspired menus create a true sense of place.
  * **Stunning mountain views encircle the spacious Wedding Meadow,** a manicured green studded with palms and tucked amid verdant hedges. It's a beautifully flexible space—add colorful floral sprays for a playful pop, rattan furnishings and glowing lanterns for a bohemian feel, or keep things simple and let the natural gorgeousness take center stage.
  * **Your celebration can stretch all weekend,** with options to host all your other events on-site too; think: a casual welcome party by the pool, a rehearsal dinner in Sol y Sombra's authentic adobe building, or a day-after brunch on the Fireplace Patio. Their private poolside Citrus Suite is also ideal for bach parties, with special inclusive packages to make planning easy.
