## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Combining timeless New England charm with a boutique finesse,** this historic homestead in downtown Wolfeboro has been transformed from a 19th-century estate into an award-winning inn and event venue nestled just blocks from iconic Lake Winnepesaukee.
  * **The soaring post-and-beam reception barn is bursting with authentic character: T** hink vintage brick, floor-to-ceiling windows, and a twinkle-lit loft. Outside, a vine-draped pergola and glowing bistro lights offer a lovely backdrop for al fresco ceremonies or toasts under the stars.
  * **Take over the Pickering House’s 10 curated guest rooms** for the whole weekend,**** whether your guest count leans more “micro” or “macro.” All overnight stays also include use of the lovely common areas, porches, and patios, as well as a gourmet breakfast served each morning for those lucky enough to join you for the duration.
