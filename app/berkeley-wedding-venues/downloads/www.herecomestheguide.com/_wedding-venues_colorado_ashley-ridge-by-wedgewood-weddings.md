##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **Ceremonies on the venue's sunlit courtyard are complemented by tranquil waterfalls** and breathtaking views of the Rocky Mountain foothills.

  * **The spacious ballroom blends classic and modern elements for an effortless chic:** Wood flooring, a high ceiling, and double-tall windows along with a cool taupe-and-gray color scheme create an elegant setting for your celebration.
  * **The team of talented Wedgewood Weddings consultants is dedicated** to creating a stress-free planning experience—and a one-of-a-kind event. They'll guide you through all the options of their all-inclusive packages, including introductions to their exclusive vendor partners.
