## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This romantic, 1919 Italian Renaissance mansion** epitomizes the elegant lifestyle of an early 20th century textile mogul. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, its extensive renovation carefully preserved its original grandeur, making it one of the most popular wedding venues in the Charlotte area.
  * **The formal garden offers multiple ceremony sites** , like an arbor of century-old oaks or a raised, chandeliered pergola. The magnificent ballroom, replete with fluted columns, a high ceiling, and crystal chandeliers, is a perfect indoor option for exchanging vows, followed by cocktails on the limestone and tile veranda.
  * **Their staff can help you plan a large gala or an intimate affair** , utilizing the mansion's unique layout and myriad spaces. Choose an all-inclusive package, partnering with a preferred list of local vendors, or take an à la carte approach if that's more your style.
