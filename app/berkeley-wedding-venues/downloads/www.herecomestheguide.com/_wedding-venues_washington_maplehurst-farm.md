## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its vibrant green grounds and stunning views of Mount Baker,** this family run farm along the Skagit River offers loads of photographic potential—a historic mansion, landscaped gardens, old growth trees, vine-draped arbors, and more. 
  * **Hold your ceremony in a wide, open field overlooking nearby farmland,** followed by cocktails, lawn games, and a tented reception on the grass. Or, move the party to the fun, rustic barn: one whole side opens up to an adjacent patio, giving the space a great indoor-outdoor feel. 
  * **There's a lovely on-site guest house that sleeps twelve.** It boasts a spacious living room, kitchen, full bathroom, laundry room, and two decks that offer views of surrounding Skagit Valley.
