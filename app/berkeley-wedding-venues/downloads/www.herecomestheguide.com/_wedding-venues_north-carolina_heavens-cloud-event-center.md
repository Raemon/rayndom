## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This pastoral venue, nestled on 4 acres of rolling hills and grassy lawns,** offers a beautiful blank canvas on which to paint your perfect day. Affordable package options provide plenty of flexibility, too: elopements and micro-weddings are welcome, and you're able to reserve just the indoor or outdoor venues, or the whole property.
  * **Exchange vows beneath a handmade wooden pergola in the expansive meadow,** backed by lush woodlands and tree-studded hills that glow in the evening light.**** Keep things entirely al fresco with a reception in the large, open-sided pavilion, which allows the party to flow onto an ample lawn perfect for yard games.
  * **They welcome all vendors, vibes, and visions.** The gracious event spaces allow you to dream big: whether you envision an intimate elopement on the grounds, a retro shindig in the cute 1950s-style ballroom, or a grand strolling reception with food trucks and dancing under the stars... the only limit is your imagination!
