## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

Spread out along the bluffs overlooking Monterey Bay, this resort definitely lives up to its name. From almost any vantage point, inside or out, you have sweeping ocean vistas, and if you're one of those people who comes alive in the sea air (and who isn't?), you'll find the surroundings here quite rejuvenating.

Take the ceremony spot, for example: It's an expanse of lawn on top of a bluff, set against a postcard-beautiful backdrop of cypress trees and shimmering sea. The miniforest at the edge of the property is a favorite place for the couple to have their pictures taken, and a short path leads down to the beach for a walk along the sand.

Receptions are held indoors in a variety of banquet rooms. The largest, the Seascape Room, has a light, airy feel and fabulous ocean views. Smaller weddings take place in the Riviera Room, which has one wall of windows that face the bay and another that overlooks the treetops. A skylight adds to the natural light in the space. Probably the most popular room for intimate gatherings is the Bayview Room. It not only faces the ocean, but has its own terrace. For a very small party or rehearsal dinner, reserve the Peninsula Room. It, too, benefits from an abundance of windows as well as views of the bay and tree-studded bluff.

All of these spaces, along with additional rooms, are also available for meetings. Each one has state-of-the-art audio, video, computer, high-speed internet and modem connections. Another huge benefit are the in-house professional meeting, wedding and special event planners who will assist you with the planning and execution of your event.

Whether you're getting married or hosting a meeting, conference or retreat here, Seascape is a great place to bring your guests for an extended stay. All of the accommodations (from suites to two-bedroom beach villas) have decks or patios, kitchenettes and fireplaces, and many have direct ocean views. You can go for a dip in one of three heated pools and hot spas, or take advantage of the tennis courts, gym and Olympic-size pool at the Seascape Sports Club. Sanderlings, the on-site restaurant, offers dining with sweeping ocean vistas. Nearby there are award-winning golf courses, and, of course, the Santa Cruz/Monterey/Carmel coastline is one of the most spectacular stretches of coast in the country. So, if you're tempted to turn your event into a vacation, go ahead—Seascape makes it easy.
