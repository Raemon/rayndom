## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This historic 1920s stone manor** will have guests feeling as if they’ve been whisked back to Hollywood’s Regency Era, and you’ll find dozens of fantastic photo spots throughout the pristine vintage interiors and surrounding manicured gardens.
  * **Wed on the hedge-rimmed lawn****with one of the estate's towering tiered fountains as your backdrop,** then move to the charming, rose bush-lined slate courtyard for a romantic reception. Here, you’ll find a graceful water feature, mature shade trees, and, as night falls, dramatic uplighting on the mansion’s walls.
  * **It’s owned and operated by the stellar team at Venues & Estates, **who provide experienced, caring guidance throughout your process. Plus, their all-inclusive packages make planning a snap, and ensure no detail is overlooked.
