##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **A family-run garden and arboretum** **outside the charming town of Princeton,** this lovely spot is a photographer’s dream, with botanical garden displays that draw enthusiasts from around the nation. 
  * **Exchange vows in the gardens,** overlooking a peaceful pond, then meander toward your reception in the impressive, climate-controlled barn, which boasts cedar siding, exposed posts and beams, and plentiful windows. 
  * **As night begins to fall,** your guests can step onto the adjacent covered patio to admire the sunset, or play games on the lush lawns.
