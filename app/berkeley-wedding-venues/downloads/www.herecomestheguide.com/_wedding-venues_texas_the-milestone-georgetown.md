## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled on 40 lush acres above the San Gabriel river** , this private, full-service event center offers both indoor and outdoor venues. It feels peaceful and secluded, but is just a short drive from tons of accommodations in Pflugerville and Round Rock.
  * **Exchange vows outside beneath a peak-roofed pergola.** Afterward, you'll capture gorgeous photos around the manicured grounds, while your guests enjoy a cocktail hour on the reception hall's wraparound porch.
  * **You'll love the hall's airy "modern farmhouse" design** —it's both gracious and refined, with open-beam trusses and tons of light streaming through oversized windows onto the blonde hardwood floors.
