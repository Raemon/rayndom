  * **Originally a private residence, this stunning palatial hotel** still retains the glamour of the 1920s and the intimate ambiance of a home.
  * **A wall of arched conservatory windows runs the length of the Promenade Room** , providing lots of natural light as well as beautiful views of the grounds.
  * **You can tailor your reception to fit your style** , with menu additions like a street taco station or a custom wedding cake.
