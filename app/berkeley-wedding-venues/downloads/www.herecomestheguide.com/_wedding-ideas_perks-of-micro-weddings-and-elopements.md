# 12 Perks of Micro Weddings and Elopements

## 

**Our favorite thing about micro weddings and elopements is that they open up endless possibilities.** When it's just you and your boo, or a cozy VIP guest list, you're able to craft a thoughtfully-curated event full of authenticity, meaning, and connection— _without_ the stress of having to "please" everyone.

**We also love that every mini wedding is majorly unique!** And while we could go on and on about the upsides of teeny weddings, we've listed 12 perks of having a supremely intimate event.
