## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located in the historic stone Beaux Arts building** known as West Bath House, this stunning venue sits right on Long Island's iconic Jones Beach, offering high style and fantastic Atlantic Ocean views.
  * **Exchange vows at the water's edge,** followed by a tented reception on the large lawn, or in the wonderful ballroom. Here, you'll find a soaring beamed ceiling, vintage light fixtures, and oversized windows on three sides creating a gorgeous ocean panorama.
  * **They have tons of packages from which to choose,** and are happy to customize things, too. There are lots of great options for local lodging—both traditional hotels and vacation rentals—a great perk if you have guests traveling from out of town.
