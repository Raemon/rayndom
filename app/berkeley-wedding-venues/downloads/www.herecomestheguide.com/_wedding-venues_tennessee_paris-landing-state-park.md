## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its sleek, modern design, this spacious lodge** is a jewel in the crown of the Tennessee State Parks system, where forest-lined trails lead to peaceful lakefront views and a breeze comes off Kentucky Lake. Floor-to-ceiling windows throughout beautifully bring the outside in, ensuring you’re never far from the stunning natural surroundings.
  * **Perched above the water and boasting truly expansive views,** the Lakeside Terrace is a stunning setting for al fresco gatherings. Inside, the grand Tennessee Ballroom and intimate Lakeview Room provide options for any guest count, or opt for an all-outdoor affair beneath a tent on the lawn or in the amphitheater. 
  * **Plenty of on-site lodging means no one has to hurry home**. 91 lakeside guest rooms and 10 adorable cabins can host all your loved ones, who will also enjoy access to the lodge’s ample amenities, including an on-site restaurant, outdoor pool, marina, and paddling rentals.
