  * **Outdoor ceremonies nestled in the scenic Ponderosa Pines Forest** are beautiful no matter what the season, whether green and bright or snowy and white!
  * **A cozy stone fireplace, hardwood furnishings, and plenty of natural light** make their conference center a congenial spot for hosting an indoor event. 
  * **With 44 luxurious guest rooms and cabins** —some with their own private patios and all with 49” plasma televisions and sumptuous pillow-top mattresses—your guests will never want to leave!
