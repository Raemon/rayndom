## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This elegant, full-service private event venue** **has a convenient Queens location** and an ultra-glamorous vibe, with fun, party-enhancing surprises around every corner. Our favorite feature? The built-in secret elevator that lets you make a surprise grand entrance right onto the dance floor. 
  * **There’s a lovely waterfront garden** available for your outdoor ceremony, or you can opt to wed in one of the dazzling ballrooms, letting the staff handle the seamless transformation into a breathtaking reception space. Plus, the secret staircase sets the stage for a magnificent, one-of-a-kind entrance that will wow your guests.
  * **Consider booking the swanky Rose Lounge for your afterparty.** With its brightly colored, luxe furnishings, cool sculptural light fixtures, and vibrant, supper club feel, it’s the perfect spot to gather when you’re not ready for the festivities to end.
