## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This elegant, waterfront venue** located in the Goat Island Marina offers amazing views of the classic luxury yachts in Newport Harbor, as well as the glittering waters of the Atlantic beyond.
  * **Receptions are held inside a sophisticated cream-and-white striped tent** , complete with chandeliers and billowing draperies. Your celebration can flow out onto the adjoining dockside patio, accompanied by ocean breezes.
  * **They offer the perfect ending to your celebration:** the opportunity for up to 68 passengers to sail away aboard the classic Schooner Aurora, conveniently docked nearby in the harbor. For something one-of-a-kind, you can even host your intimate ceremony on the water!
