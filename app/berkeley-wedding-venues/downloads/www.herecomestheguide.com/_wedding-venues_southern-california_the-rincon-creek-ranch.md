## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled in a paradise of oaks in the hills of Carpinteria, this peaceful ranch** has a rich history of hospitality: from its 1894 origins as a stagecoach stop to a reputation as a magical getaway for the stars. Today, it's a family-owned working avocado ranch... and a truly idyllic, utterly private oasis for al fresco celebrations.
  * **Dappled light plays on the verdant grass of the Meadow,** as the burbling of the adjacent Rincon Creek creates a tranquil soundtrack for your exchange of vows. Follow with a laid-back cocktail hour or intimate reception at the Park and Pavilion, which boasts an outdoor kitchen, large fireplace, and a covered courtyard, all illuminated by twinkle lights.
  * **Set against the sun-kissed hillside, the remarkable Creekside Piazza provides endless possibilities** for large events. Rough-hewn logs and boulders frame the raised event pad, accessed by brick ramps or a dramatic stone staircase. Ceremonies are often held at the stairs' apex, ensuring your all loved ones have a perfect view, followed by mingling or playing bocce ball on the surrounding landscaped grounds.
