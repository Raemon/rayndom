## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **With a gorgeous Mad River Valley location** and full-service resort offerings, this is the quintessential Vermont getaway—the perfect blend of alpine charm and simple elegance.
  * **Take a chair lift to Mountaintop Meadow,** where you’ll wed with sweeping views of the Green Mountains and surrounding valley. Return to the stunning, light-filled Gate House Lodge for your reception—it boasts a soaring vaulted ceiling and dramatic wall of windows.
  * **There’s room for everyone to stay the weekend (or longer!),** with accommodation options that include one-bedroom luxury hotel rooms, cozy rooms at the main inn, and four-bedroom resort condos for groups and families.
