## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its prime location in the heart of Covington, KY, just blocks from Cincinnati,** this stylish spot offers the best of all possible worlds—a vibrant urban setting that will thrill both locals and out-of-towners, thoughtful event planning, beautifully designed spaces with ample amenities, and a price tag that’s surprisingly affordable.
  * **Find your perfect fit among their three ceremony sites and six unique ballrooms**. Say “I do” in the light-filled Terrace framed by floor-to-ceiling windows, the industrial-chic Loft, or the intimate Chapel before choosing your perfect reception space: Options range from the expansive Grande with its sweeping staircase to the elevated, chandelier-draped Crystal to the contemporary Royale, which is warmed by a sleek built-in fireplace.
  * **Their all-inclusive packages are designed to ensure planning is just as joyful as the celebration,** with a completely customizable menu, unlimited beverages with plenty of room for innovation (think whiskey tasting stations or sangria bars), plenty of in-house décor, and most importantly, a fabulous team of planners and coordinators to guide you through it all.
