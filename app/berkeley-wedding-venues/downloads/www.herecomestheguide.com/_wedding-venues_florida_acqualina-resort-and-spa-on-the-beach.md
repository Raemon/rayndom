## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This grand, luxury resort showers you with individualized service.** With 4.5 acres of stunning beachfront property on which to create your ideal wedding, you’ll appreciate the expertise of a personal planner to help you realize your vision.
  * **Enjoy the sand, the ocean and a lawn in one fabulous location.** No need for compromise when you can get it all, including swaying palms and killer views in an ideal setting…and that doesn’t include the indoor options—four European-styled banquet rooms.
  * **The resort’s “extras” turn your wedding into a destination.** Indulge in some serious pampering at the spa, a round of golf, nearby fishing, or just frolicking in the waves, because once you’re here you won’t want to leave.
