## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Old World elegance meets modern-industrial vibes** at this cool spot in downtown San Jose. Encompassing three stories of a historic brick building, it's now a stylish blank canvas for all kinds of celebrations.
  * **The expansive Rooftop, perched atop Historic San Pedro Square,** is beautifully appointed with a rustic fireplace, olive trees, and bistro lighting. An adjacent Mezzanine allows for an easy overflow space, or a lovely setting for an intimate cocktail hour—exposed brick and an imported antique clock from France offer a European touch.
  * **Chic starburst-inspired chandeliers grace the 30-foot ceilings of the Great Room,** a fabulous unobstructed indoor space that allows for multiple creative configuration options. All rentals include full access to the entire venue—all three spaces—which means you'll enjoy tons of flexibility in planning the flow of your day.
