## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This enchanting 1893 hotel brings a sense of European romance to the Rockies,** with turreted towers, arched stone entryways, and Juliet balconies peeking over a courtyard strung with bistro lights. Tucked in the heart of charming Glenwood Springs and surrounded by the glorious mountains, it’s a destination-style getaway wrapped in vintage charm.
  * **Exchange vows before the courtyard’s elegant tiered fountain,** surrounded by mature trees and colorful seasonal blooms, then join your guests for cocktails in the adjacent Garden Room. You’re spoiled for choice with the indoor spaces too, which include the grand Devereaux Ballroom, intimate Taft Room, and the Colorado Ballroom, with its wall of windows.
  * **You’ll be treated to refined, chef-curated cuisine that will delight every palate,** along with the expert assistance of their award-winning events team. Extend the celebration with lodging in the beautifully renovated guest rooms and suites, and spend your days lounging by the lobby fireplace, exploring the nearby hot springs and adventure park, or inquiring about the hotel’s lively paranormal past (this place has stories!).
