## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Built in 1930 when golf was still an elite sport, this refined club** and its surrounding 11-acre greens are now a welcoming setting for celebrations of all kinds, from grand galas to relaxed, intimate gatherings. 
  * **A historic, Spanish-style clubhouse adjoins a sprawling garden lawn** encircled by lush foliage. Outdoor ceremonies are lovely on this manicured expanse, with flowering borders and trees providing natural adornment. If you prefer a lake view, the first-tee box offers a more intimate space in a gorgeous setting.
  * **Three unique event spaces ensure a perfect fit for your reception.** Host an impressive soiree in the Avalon Ballroom, with its ornate brass chandeliers, tall windows, and spectacular views of the emeral fairways. More intimate affairs are held in the Hacienda Room, a wonderfully airy and light-filled space, and the marvelous Fireside Room exudes a cozy, vintage-inspired elegance.
