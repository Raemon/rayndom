## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This oasis-inspired spot sits on over 100 wooded acres** of Lake County countryside. Though it feels completely private and secluded, it’s less than 40 miles from Orlando, and an easy drive from the airport and Disney resorts.
  * **Exchange vows at The Lake Pointe, backed by the brilliant colors of a sunset** over the sparkling water. Additional ceremony sites are equally lovely, each offering their own lakefront vistas: the sun-dappled Pines site is nestled amid lush woodland greenery, the Oak Hammock sits beneath the soaring arms of ancient pines and oaks, and the Great Lawn is set atop a gentle hill with easy access to the reception Garden Pavilion.
  * **There are two gracious, standalone dressing suites,** each thoughtfully appointed with plenty of vanities, a wet bar, and lounging areas, so you’ll have plenty of space for day-of prep. Additional helpful amenities include yard games, a fire pit, and a large selection of in-house décor.
