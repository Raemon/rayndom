## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With acres of manicured grounds overlooking endless, gently rolling hills and farmland,** this special spot was purpose-built for celebrations by the family that has historically called it home. Ten years later, the Farm has hosted over 600 weddings, and the owners pride themselves on ensuring the venue is both beautiful and affordable. 
  * **There are so many lovely, stylish spaces to choose from,** and they’ve all been designed with ideal party flow in mind. From the amphitheater overlooking the fields to the stunning, open-sided, French-industrial Pavilion, and everything in between. (We’re big fans of the rustic-chic bar area!) 
  * **They’re an eco-friendly venue committed to sustainability—** in addition to efforts like on-site recycling, composting, and environmentally friendly product usage, they donate ten trees to be planted for every wedding hosted by partnering with One Tree Planted.
