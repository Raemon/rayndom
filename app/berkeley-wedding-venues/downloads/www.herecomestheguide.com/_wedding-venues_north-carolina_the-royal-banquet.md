## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **Tucked into the historic Royal Bakery building,** this welcoming spot boasts an "Old World meets Southern charm" aesthetic, and a great location at the edge of Raleigh's vibrant downtown. 
  * **The interior boasts exposed brick,** an open-rafter ceiling, and hardwood dance floor. A color palette of neutral tones means the space will work with virtually any color theme. 
  * **You're welcome to use any vendors you wish,** but they'll also provide you with a list of recommended pros—area favorites who are familiar with the venue and have a solid, respected reputation in the community.
