## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Though tucked in the heart of L.A., this golf club boasts the kind of amenities** you'd expect from a much less urban setting:**** a beautiful outdoor ceremony site, a ballroom with verdant views and plenty of natural light, great rates, and ample free parking.
  * **Ceremonies take place at the gazebo, against a backdrop of rolling green hills and mature trees.** Afterward, cocktails and hors d'oeuvres are served on the clubhouse patio, which flows easily into the congenial bar. Steps away, you'll find the elegant ballroom, which boasts a soft, neutral palette, a built-in parquet dance floor, and floor-to-ceiling windows and doors that form a long curved wall overlooking the surrounding greenery.
  * **Tented receptions are a wonderful option for an all-al fresco affair.** Enhancements like draping, chandeliers, string lights, uplighting, and lanterns let you create the style and mood you desire, and when the tent is connected to the ballroom via ceiling draping and sliding glass doors, it feels like one expansive space.
