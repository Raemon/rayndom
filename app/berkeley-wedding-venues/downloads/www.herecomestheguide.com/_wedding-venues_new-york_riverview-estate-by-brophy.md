##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The quintessential Catskills retreat,** this lovely estate consists of over 1,200 mountainside acres with hiking paths, open gathering spaces, welcoming rustic-chic lodging, and flexible event spaces. 
  * **Your dreamy ceremony site sits on a hillside overlooking the Upper Delaware River,** and features quaint log and trestle guest seating and a beautiful handmade wooden arch. 
  * **You can continue your celebration outdoors—** there is beautiful evening lighting throughout the grounds—or in the barn-style banquet hall, with its cozy rustic vibe, whimsical birch log detailing, and warmly glowing crystal chandeliers.
