## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It combines rustic charm with modern amenities.** Family-owned and operated, the winery itself offers a cozy, intimate feel. However, the event center provides the grand, elegant atmosphere couples envision for their special day.
  * **Great photo opportunities are everywhere!** Capture stunning pix on the elaborate mezzanine and staircase, down in the wine cellar amongst the barrels, and outdoors in the beautiful garden.
  * **You're allowed to bring in your own alcohol** , but you'll probably wish to serve some of Balistreri's handcrafted, award-winning wines, as well. Their winemaking process is totally natural, using only hand-harvested grapes and indigenous yeasts for fermentation, and they never add sulfites or other chemicals!
