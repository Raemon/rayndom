## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Looking like it’s been lifted from the pages of a storybook** , this beautiful, 1920s Tudor-style cottage features charming traditional details—diamond-pane windows, lofty, heavy-beamed ceilings, and a steeply pitched tiled roof—and is surrounded by lush, English-inspired landscaping.
  * **There’s a lovely garden ceremony site,** sheltered by shade trees and accented by a paver-stone path that leads to an elegant white pergola. Follow your vows with games on the lawn and a reception in the gorgeous covered pavilion, with its weathered checkered floor and walls of ornately designed glass doors and windows.
  * **Casa Blanca, the venue’s private vacation home,** can accommodate up to ten guests in its four-bedroom, three-bath layout. Boasting a large kitchen and gracious communal spaces, it makes a lovely spot for your day-of preparations, as well.
