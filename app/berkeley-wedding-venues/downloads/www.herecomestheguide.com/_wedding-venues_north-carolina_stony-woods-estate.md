## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched on a hilltop in the western North Carolina mountains** and within an easy drive of Asheville and all its attractions, this lovely home serves as a welcoming “home base” for your wedding weekend, and its grounds offer plenty of room to host all phases of your celebration.
  * **There are unobstructed mountain views from virtually every spot** on the property, so no matter where you place your ceremony, the panorama will be breathtaking. The bistro patio and garden are a lovely setting for cocktails al fresco, and tented receptions are held on the upper patio. You can wind down the evening gathered around the cozy fire pit.
  * **Spend the weekend exploring this popular area,** or simply hanging out around the estate—playing lawn games, hiking, gathering in the pretty courtyard or spacious living room, picnicking by the creek, or soaking in the hot tub under the stars. Guests can also find lodging in the Treesort, the estate's collection of treehouse cabins!
