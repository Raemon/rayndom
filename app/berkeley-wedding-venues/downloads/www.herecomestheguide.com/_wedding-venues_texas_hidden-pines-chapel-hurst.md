## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **When illuminated at night, this place makes you feel like you’ve come upon a fairytale cottage.** Lush gardens with a profusion of flowers and a graceful fountain surround the chapel, which boasts an impressive wooden door crowned with a leaded-glass window.
  * **Inside, wrought-iron chandeliers and candelabras adorn the ceiling and raised altar.** Tall cathedral windows, an elegant staircase, and live music for your entry all add dramatic impact to your ceremony.
  * **A carved mahogany fireplace makes the perfect backdrop to showcase the cake cutting.** Afterwards, kick up your heels on the large, polished wood dance floor beneath glowing chandeliers.
