## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **History and charm come together in one of South Carolina’s most scenic cities.** Horse-drawn carriages, graceful architecture, and the waterfront are just outside this downtown gem, which boasts both grand and intimate venues.
  * **The Rooftop Deck offers sunset views over moss-draped streets** , and the adjacent Old Bay Marketplace Loft presents sweeping panoramas. But for lush romance, start in the Tabby Garden and Courtyard, followed by an extravagant gala in Tabby Place with its impressive iron gates.
  * **Southern flair reigns from the inn’s unique décor to its delectable cuisine.** Under the direction of their head chef, a graduate of the prestigious Culinary Institute, the catering team can help you create a memorable menu.
