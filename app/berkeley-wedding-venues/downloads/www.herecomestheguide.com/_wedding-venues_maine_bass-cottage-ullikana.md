## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Tucked in the peaceful Bar Harbor neighborhood known as “The Field”,** these neighboring manors are—despite their quaint “cottage” monikers—grand examples of glamorous Gilded Age summer homes. 
  * **Cozy, bespoke gathering spaces, like a graceful, light-filled dining room and romantic gardens overlooking the iconic harbor,** lend themselves beautifully to micro-weddings and romantic elopements.
  * **Enjoy a perfect New England seaside escape when you rent both houses for the weekend.** You’re just steps from the waterfront and shore path, as well as bustling Main Street, which offers endless dining, shopping, and entertainment.
