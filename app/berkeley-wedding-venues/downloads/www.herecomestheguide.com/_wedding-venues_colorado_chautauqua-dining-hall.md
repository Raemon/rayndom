## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's a treasured example of the Chautauqua Movement of the early 20th Century,** which encouraged communities to develop gathering spaces that introduced rural citizens to new ideas, education, and issues of public concern. Now a National Historic Landmark, this Boulder outpost features original buildings and beautiful grounds that offer breathtaking sights of the Flatiron Mountains. 
  * **The Enchanted Mesa Garden hosts warm-weather ceremonies with a view** of the Bluebell and McClintock Trails. For your reception, opt for the historic Community House, with its rustic-elegant vibes (we especially love the downstairs “Rocky Mountain Climbers Club” cocktail lounge!), or the Chautauqua Dining Hall. Operated separately, the Dining Hall provides fantastic catering for all on-site venues, and its capacity can be extended in May-October with the addition of a tent. 
  * **There’s room for a crowd,** with sixty charming cottages (choose from studio, one, two, and three-bedroom layouts) and two vintage lodges. The Galey Cottage and Missions House Lodge sleep 10 and 16 guests respectively, and are also fit to host intimate weddings and rehearsal dinners.
