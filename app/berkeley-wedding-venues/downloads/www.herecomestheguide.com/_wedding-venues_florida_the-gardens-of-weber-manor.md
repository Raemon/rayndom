## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This enchanting venue has the timeless, vintage feel** of a secluded fairytale garden, with bountiful unique photo opportunities and gorgeous event spaces…and it’s just a stone’s throw from the heart of Miami.
  * **Choose between several lovely outdoor ceremony areas,** each enhanced by mature trees and lush, flowering foliage. Follow with a meadow reception under the stars, or opt for an elegant, air-conditioned tent.
  * **It’s family-owned, and available for so much more than weddings.** They’re happy to host your shower, rehearsal dinner, or farewell brunch, and packages are tailored specifically to each couple. Best yet: it’s refreshingly affordable!
