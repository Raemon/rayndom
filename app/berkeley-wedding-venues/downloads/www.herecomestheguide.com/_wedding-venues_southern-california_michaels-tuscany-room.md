## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Wrought-iron gates and slender trees adorn the outside of this romantic venue,** where three sets of French doors are topped with magnificent stained-glass windows. Though it's perfectly situated on the waterfront in dynamic San Pedro, you'll feel like you've been transported to a welcoming, elegant country home in Tuscany.
  * **The soaring, 30-feet ceiling draws the eye upward,** where you'll find pyramid-shaped skylights and ornate Old World chandeliers. There's a decorative balcony that runs the length of both sides of the room lined with a window box- and vine-draped railing, creating the illusion of being in an outdoor courtyard. 
  * **The truly mouthwatering cuisine boasts a refined Italian influence,** but the talented chefs are also happy to customize the menu to suit your tastes and style. In-house coordination is also available, allowing you to truly enjoy feel the _amore_ on your day without worrying about a thing.
