## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched on the edge of brilliant Lake Tahoe, this North Shore mecca** is not only the area's premiere fine dining destination, but also the site of what are arguably the area's most spectacular and unobstructed vistas. An exterior clad in river rock leads to the clean, modern interior, where high ceilings flows into three levels and soaring glass walls showcase irresistible views of the lake.
  * **On the spacious outdoor deck, you can exchange vows framed by majestic pines** as the sparkling water is tinted by the sunset. Afterwards, your guests can easily move inside to the bar and lounge for butler-passed hors d'ouevres and customized specialty cocktails. The centerpiece of this welcoming space is a massive stone fireplace that's not only warm and cozy, but also makes a perfect photo backdrop for your ceremony during the winter months.
  * **The two-level Dining Room's exquisite views are matched by the mouth-watering cuisine.** Thoughtfully**** prepared by the acclaimed chefs and elegantly served by a talented staff, these California-inspired menus are sure to impress your guests. End the evening with a cozy gathering in the lounge or take a spin under the stars— since this is Nevada, where there are no restrictions on when to end your music or have last call, you're welcome to party the night away.
