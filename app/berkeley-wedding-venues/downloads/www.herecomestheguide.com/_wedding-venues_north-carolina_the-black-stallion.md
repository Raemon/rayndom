## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set at the heart of the private Currituck Golf Club community** on North Carolina’s coveted Outer Banks, this unique, 20,000 square-foot “event home” is an ideal destination wedding choice, with easy accessibility to the beach, golfing, and host of other fun activities.
  * **Your event space is built right into the home.** Inside, you’ll find a gathering space with floor-to-ceiling windows, whitewashed walls, a top-notch A/V system, and a catering kitchen. Outside, There's a gorgeous pool with a spacious deck and a custom cover that converts one side of the pool into a dance floor. 
  * **With 24 bedrooms, you can house nearly everyone on site** (and at a surprisingly reasonable cost!) Though you’ll be close to all the Outer Banks action, we’re guessing you’ll be just as happy sticking around, thanks to the home’s multiple bars, well-stocked game room, spa, sauna, and spacious community areas.
