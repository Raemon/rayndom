## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its park-like setting and beautifully preserved vintage buildings** (both are on the National Register of Historic Places), this sweet spot sits just southeast of Washington, D.C., and is surrounded by ample lodging and entertainment options in charming Great Falls. 
  * **The Craftsman-style meeting hall** features a barrel-vaulted ceiling, lots of natural light, a full stage, hardwood flooring, and a downstairs banquet room that adds additional seating. Intimate gatherings can be held in the charming white Victorian schoolhouse, and a wooded grove with a covered pavilion provides a beautiful outdoor area. 
  * **Your rental allows for use of all three spaces,** so you have ultimate flexibility in structuring your event, and also includes super-helpful amenities like a dressing suite, state-of-the-art sound system, market lights, a large kitchen, and a wooden ceremony arch.
