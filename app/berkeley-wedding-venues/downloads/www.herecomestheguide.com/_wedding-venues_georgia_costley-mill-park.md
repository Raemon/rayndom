## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This peaceful county park is nestled along the banks of Big Haynes Creek** , and offers 77 acres of lush, nature-inspired event settings. Ponds, mature trees, pretty vintage buildings, and rock walls ensure you'll find plenty of places for beautiful photos.
  * **Exchange vows on the beach, where a waterfall rushing over large rocks** provides a dreamy backdrop. Or, hold your intimate ceremony in the quaint country chapel, followed by a reception in the covered waterfront Pavilion.
  * **Even more venue options are on the way** , including a rotunda for ceremonies, and an ample banquet hall complete with an attached terrace, dressing rooms, and a warming kitchen.
