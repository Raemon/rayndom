## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Fifty gently rolling acres of rural beauty surround this historic barn venue** just northeast of Oklahoma City. A flexible indoor/outdoor layout and climate-controlled barn let you comfortably celebrate in any season, and we especially appreciate their transparent, competitive pricing. 
  * **Wed beside the pond with the sound of its cascading waterfall in the background**(it’s lit up at night for extra glamour!) After your post-vow cocktails on the string-lit patio, move the party to the 1800s hand-hewn wood barn, with its towering ceiling and festive wagon wheel chandeliers. 
  * **There are luxe dressing accommodations for both sides of your wedding party,** and thoughtfully planned amenities like A/V, a catering kitchen, custom lighting, security, and WiFi ensure smooth sailing throughout the big day.
