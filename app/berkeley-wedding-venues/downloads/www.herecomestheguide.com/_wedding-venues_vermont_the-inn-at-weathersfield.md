## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled amid twenty wooded acres,** this historic bed and breakfast was built in the 1790s as a stately colonial manor home. With its secluded location and proximity to charming Woodstock, it’s a fabulous choice for a wedding weekend escape. 
  * **We’re so in love with the Chapel in the Woods,** where you can wed in a lush fern grotto beneath a canopy of sheltering trees. The spacious lawns offer plenty of room for tent—choose a clear-topped option to make the most of your ultra-green surroundings. 
  * **Twelve unique guest rooms, each with a private bath,** offer accommodation for most of your overnight guests. Additional lodging, including hotels and vacation rentals, are available in nearby Woodstock.
