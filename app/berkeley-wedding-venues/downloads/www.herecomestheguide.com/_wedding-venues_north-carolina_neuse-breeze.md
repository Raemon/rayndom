## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched on the banks of the Neuse River** and offering incredible views of Pamlico Sound, this exclusive waterfront estate boasts an elegant, timeless style and venues that were designed from the ground up with weddings in mind.
  * **Exchange vows with a sweeping, unobstructed view of the water** from the estate’s grand lawn. Follow with al fresco cocktails and games, then adjourn to the Pavilion—it’s fully climate-controlled and can be enclosed if desired, but when its sides are left open, you’re treated to a lovely panorama of the river and grounds. 
  * **Their all-inclusive package makes planning a snap—** it incorporates everything from basics, like catering, florals and DJ services, to fantastic extras, like overnight accommodations for the weekend and the help of an awesome day-of coordinator.
