## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The natural woodland setting of this elegant golf club offers lovely photo settings** —throughout the landscaped grounds you'll find gently rolling hills, romantic walking paths, and rock-rimmed ponds.
  * **Floor-to-ceiling arched windows fill the ballroom with natural light,** and offer sweeping views of the property. An attached covered patio increases your flexibility; it's a popular spot for an outdoor bar, an hors d'oeuvres station, or a lounge area. 
  * **Entirely al fresco affairs are held in the graceful, airy pavilion.** It's fully sheltered (so you won't need to worry about uncooperative weather) and all four sides are open (so you won't miss out on any of those gorgeous views).
