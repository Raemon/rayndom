## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located in Denver’s Art District****, this gallery/event space** features clean, modern lines and stunning architectural elements, with a 21-foot ceiling, gleaming concrete floor, orb lighting, and contemporary artwork displayed throughout.
  * **With a focus on versatility and flexibility** , the venue can be configured for a variety of events, from a sleek cocktail reception to a seated dinner with room for dancing. You can bring in your choice of catering and beverage vendors, too.
  * **An outdoor sculpture garden works well as an intimate ceremony site** or a place for guests to mingle between events. Strung with bistro lights, it’s especially magical at night.
