## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located in a beautifully restored 1881 building** —a former cigar factory—this airy event space brings together the best of old and new, with historic wood columns, original brick walls, and oversized windows to create a spacious, open feel.
  * **Natural light fills the main room** , which overlooks the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge as it spans the Cooper River. The venue rental also includes a dressing suite, a built-in bar, a warming kitchen, and an open-air courtyard that makes a lovely ceremony setting.
  * **Exclusive in-house caterer** _**Mercantile and Mash**_ provides elevated menus filled with seasonal, high-quality dishes, all carefully crafted by the in-house executive chef and pastry team. You'll find a delightful array of options, from passed hors d'oeuvres to carving stations and late-night bites.
