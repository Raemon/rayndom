## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **You’ll find four distinct garden settings at this lush venue** just south of Salem in Oregon’s desirable wine country. Each space offers uniquely gorgeous photo backdrops, and the recent renovation of the rustic-elegant Oak Room allows celebrations to take place year-round.
  * **In the Japanese Garden, there’s a quaint traditional tea house overlooking tranquil water features,** and in the Gazebo Garden, a pretty white gazebo is perched over a pond. Both make charming spots for intimate outdoor weddings. 
  * **Larger events can be set in the Cherry Blossom Garden,** whose towering ornamental trees are spectacular in the spring, when their bright pink flowers are in full bloom, or in the English Garden, which features a romantic arbor covered in fragrant honeysuckle. 



### PRICES: _What's this going to cost?_
