## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Nestled amid colorful shops and cafés dotting the shoreline of Carpinteria,** a seaside community just south of Santa Barbara, this elegant club exudes warmth and charm. Just a five-minute stroll to the beach, it's ideal for ceremonies on the sand, where Rincon’s experienced style squad will personalize your setting: an aisle lined with seashells and driftwood, a bamboo arch draped with tropical garlands, or even a circle of grass sod right on the sand!
  * **The Club boasts two main event areas:** The Dining Room, which exudes a quiet elegance; and the Wedding Garden, a leafy courtyard enclosed by 10-foot-high walls of flowering vines and lined with shimmering fairy light curtains. In this charming outdoor oasis, reception tables are arranged on a spacious flagstone patio beneath an ingenious wooden framework embellished with wooden chandeliers and Tuscan string lights (a rose garden at one end is also a pretty spot for ceremonies).
  * **Expert planning, event production, and palate-pleasing cuisine are also part of the package**. This full-service approach is not only a time- and money-saver, it also results in a more cohesive expression of your vision. This is especially evident when it comes to your menu, which they’ll customize from aperitif to dessert. From global-inspired delicacies to the latest food trends, absolutely nothing intimidates these culinary artists!
