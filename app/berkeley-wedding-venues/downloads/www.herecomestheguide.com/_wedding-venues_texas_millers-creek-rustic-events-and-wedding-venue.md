## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This pretty, family-run wedding venue** sits on eight lovely acres dotted with ancient shade trees. Vintage outbuildings, sweet authentic farm touches, and an antique 1955 Ford truck ensure memorable photos.
  * **Free-standing barn doors and a cute wooden walkway** lead to your ceremony spot, where you'll be encircled by five ancient post oak trees, each estimated to be up to 300 years old. Follow with a celebration in the cheerful red barn, whose doors open to let in breezes and views of the lovely grounds.
  * **They offer three packages to fit a variety of needs** and bring to the table a commitment to personalized service, a focus on affordability, and the experience of hosting over 276 weddings. Their convenient payment plans help take the stress out of budgeting.
