## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Made to host the ultimate wedding weekend,** this unique, casual-chic College Station/Bryan venue has everything you need: gorgeous outdoor spaces, a modern, artfully appointed reception hall, and luxe on-site group lodging. 
  * **Your dear ones will look on from custom pew-style benches** as you exchange vows waterside by the gazebo. Stonehem Hall is your impressive celebration destination, and it’s a beauty, with a soaring vaulted ceiling, towering stone pillars, and dramatic rustic-modern lighting. 
  * **The Inn itself can sleep 25 guests** throughout its sprawling 7,000 square feet of living space, and includes a pool, hot tub, baby grand piano, fire pits, and fabulous covered porches with a nearby fire pit.
