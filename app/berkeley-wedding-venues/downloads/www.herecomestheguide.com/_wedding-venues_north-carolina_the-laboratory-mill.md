## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Steeped in rich local history, this former cotton mill** and Civil War–era medical laboratory has been meticulously renovated. The owners painstakingly worked to restore the original design, and even crafted an authentic red wash to recolor the bricks.
  * **It's nestled beside the South Fork Catawba River** , which used to power the mill's water wheel. Now, the sandy banks and meandering curves of the waterfront offer a picturesque and natural backdrop for photos.
  * **The interior seamlessly blends the old and the new** , with gorgeous hardwood flooring, exposed ductwork, and warmly glowing light fixtures. Walls of windows allow a flood of natural light and provide views of the lush surrounding forest.
