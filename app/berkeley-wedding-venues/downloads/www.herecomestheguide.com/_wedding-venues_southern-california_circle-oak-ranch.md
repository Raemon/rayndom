## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Immerse yourself in the sun-kissed hilltops and lush foliage** of this lovely, family-owned venue tucked in the De Luz Valley, just west of Temecula. Their all-inclusive packages provide incredible convenience and and flexibility, and include a wonderful wedding coordination team who will guide you start-to-finish.
  * **The canopy of a centuries-old oak creates a shady circle where you'll exchange vows,** backed by a white fence and ample greenery beyond. While your guests savor hors d'oeuvres and wine on the Cocktail Hour Patio, you can steal away with your photographer to the hilltop, which offers spectacular golden hour panoramas of the verdant valleys and mountains.
  * **Make your grand entrance down the greenery-lined stairs onto the reception patio** for dinner and dancing under the stars. The vibe is convivial and welcoming: market-light draped trees add a warm glow, the stacked stone borders of the space invite mingling, and the ivy-draped berm offers a pretty evergreen backdrop for photos.
