## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Built in 1917,** this opulent club was inspired by the design of the Spanish missions, and exhibits many of the features that make the style so beloved and iconic, like terracotta roof tiles, intricate embellishments over its windows and doors, and a charming bell tower. 
  * **The dreamy courtyard is an utterly romantic spot to exchange vows,** with its ivy-covered walls lined by graceful arched windows and mature trees. A charming Juliet balcony overlooks the entire space, and makes a fun spot for your bouquet toss.
  * **Lofty vaulted ceilings, ornate wrought-iron chandeliers and sconces, and rows of archways** lend a timeless, Old World feel to the ballroom. French doors connect the room to the courtyard, maximizing flow and enticing guests to step out and enjoy the sunset.
