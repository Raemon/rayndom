## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located in the heart of Sonoma Wine Country, this beautiful club offers some of the very best views** the area has to offer: the panoramas here encompass an award-winning golf course, the Mayacama Mountains and the entire Sonoma Valley. If that's not enough to entice you, it's also beloved for its customizable wedding packages that not only cover all the essentials, but also offer plenty of upgrades... all at an affordable price.
  * **Ceremonies are held beside an idyllic pond fringed by trees and softly swaying grasses,** where guests are treated to picturesque views of Hood Mountain. Alternatively, you can wed on an expansive terrace that overlooks the 18th green. While guests toast the newlyweds, they also enjoy the gorgeous landscape which features groves of mature firs, sycamores, maple and redwoods with the Mayacamas in the distance.
  * **When it's time to dine, three sets of double doors open into the spacious ballroom,** which can be divided into smaller sections if desired. During the day, natural light flows in thanks to floor-to-ceiling windows that frame the enchanting vistas. In the evening, the party can flow out onto the terrace, where family and friends might gather around fire pits beneath strings of festive bistro lights.
