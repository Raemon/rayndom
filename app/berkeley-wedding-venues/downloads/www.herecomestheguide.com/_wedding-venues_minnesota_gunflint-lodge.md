## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **For over 100 years, people have gathered at this classic lakeside resort,** nestled into the boreal forest on the south shore of Gunflint Lake at the edge of the iconic Boundary Waters. Today, it's just as beloved for its natural beauty as for its exceptional hospitality and topnotch cuisine, making it a picture-perfect setting for your Northwoods nuptials.
  * **The crisp scent of pines and the call of the loons accompany your "I do"s on the shore,** with a woodsy Canadian backdrop at the lake's far edge. Indoor options are just as inviting, ranging from the cozy Gunflint Lodge to the sleek Northern Lights Lodge, where massive, double-story windows frame sweeping views of the lake... and, if you're lucky, the auroras!
  * **Between celebrations, there's an endless array of possibilities for you and your guests**. Stay active with canoe day trips, guided fishing outings, or ziplining through the forest canopy; enjoy naturalist presentations and boating on the lake; or simply relax with a glass of wine by the fireplace in the main lodge or one of the charming cabins with your loved ones all around you.
