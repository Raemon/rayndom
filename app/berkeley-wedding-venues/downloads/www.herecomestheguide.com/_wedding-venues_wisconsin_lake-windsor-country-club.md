## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The grounds of this Madison-convenient club offer especially pretty scenery** for photos (that dramatic footbridge has us swooning!), and the capable, caring staff genuinely goes above and beyond for each celebration. 
  * **A charming white gazebo overlooking the golf course** presents a pretty option for outdoor ceremonies, and you can follow with an indoor reception in one of the Club’s sleek ballrooms, which each boast floor-to-ceiling windows along their gracefully curved walls. 
  * **The Ruby offers a truly special space for warm weather affairs.** A grand, peaked tent surrounded by lush lawns, it’s beautifully lit by vintage-modern sconces and strings bistro lights for an utterly romantic experience.
