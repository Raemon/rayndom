## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Fountains, reflecting ponds, and gardens** surround this impressive Italianate manor. The private, Tuscan-inspired estate is a short drive from central Miami, but feels a world away.
  * **Your rental includes use of the entire property and home** , so you can structure your event however you please. Hold a ceremony beneath the cupola in the "Gardens of Love", followed by cocktails on the patio and dinner on the lawn. Or, wed on the lawn and then dine and dance in the grand mansion—so many great options!
