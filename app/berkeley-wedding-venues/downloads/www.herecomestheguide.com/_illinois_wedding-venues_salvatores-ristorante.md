## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Salvatore’s is a popular choice for all types of celebrations:** It’s located on a beautiful treelined street in Lincoln Park; the restaurant’s layout is ideally suited for events; and their event coordinators are experts at creating a soirée designed exclusively for you.
  * **Events flow between several charming spaces** , starting in the Grand Lobby with its black & white marble floor. Dining takes place in the combined mahogany-walled Classico Room and the airy Pasta Vino Dining Room and Bar. The West Room, outfitted with French windows and an antique baby grand piano, is perfect for cocktails and dancing. 
  * **You can have an indoor/outdoor experience!** French doors in the Classico Room and Pasta Vino Dining Room open to a lovely patio, which faces a European-style courtyard full of trees, fountains and a white pergola—a pretty backdrop for events and photos!
  * **Salvatore’s Private Events Staff can provide a list of recommended Chicago-based vendors** , such as florists, photographers, musicians and entertainers, and will assist in matching you up with whatever services you need.
  * **A variety of menu packages are offered** , ranging from an elegant sit-down dinner to a family-style meal or stations menu, and Salvatore’s is always happy to customize menu items. All wedding packages include a wedding cake, which can also be added to any of their other packages.
