## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Remarkable event spaces:** Enjoy cocktails amongst the futuristic architecture of the Clark Family Welcome Gallery. Later, dance the night away in the Grainger Sky Theater on a floor lit up by LED lights. Both spaces become even more visually stunning when you project your choice of colorful lighting on the walls and ceiling.
  * **Spectacular views and fun:** Receptions in the Solarium treat diners to Chicago's glittering skyline through a wall of glass, while the Skyline and Sundial Terraces offer an al fresco setting with the same panoramic vistas. You can also add one-of-a-kind activities to your celebration, such as taking your guests on a journey through the cosmos, or inviting them to view the Moon, planets, and stars through a telescope set up just for your event (subject to weather and staff availability).
  * **Great food and good karma:** _Food For Thought,_ the Planetarium's exclusive caterer, creates customized menus based on local and organic ingredients whenever possible. Even cooler, _Food for Thought_ is a women- and minority-run business that promotes diversity and inclusion, so you can feel good knowing your delicious dining and drinks is also doing good in the community.
