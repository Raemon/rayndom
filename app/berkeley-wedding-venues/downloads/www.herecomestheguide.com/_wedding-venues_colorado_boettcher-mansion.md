## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This historic 1917 Arts & Crafts mansion sits atop Lookout Mountain**, and is completely surrounded by a nature preserve. It has the feel of a secluded alpine retreat, but is only a half-hour drive from Denver.
  * **Host your ceremony outside on the Patio** , followed by cocktails in the lush, native-plant gardens. Receptions are ultra-romantic in the Fireside Room, with its stacked rock walls and wooden cathedral ceiling that were constructed using materials found right on site. 
  * **The experienced staff will be there to help with all aspects of planning** —they can even provide you with a "sunset schedule" so you'll know just how to time things for maximum gorgeousness.
