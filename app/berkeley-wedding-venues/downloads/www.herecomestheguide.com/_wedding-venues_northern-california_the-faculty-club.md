## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located in the heart of Berkeley's campus but with a tucked-away feel, this lovely venue** sits quietly ensconced in a grove of redwoods, oaks and maples next to meandering Strawberry Creek, this lovely . Built in 1902 by the renowned architect Bernard Maybeck in traditional Arts and Crafts style, it's designed to create a cozy, intimate feeling.
  * **The crowning glory of the club is the three-story Great Hall.** With its vaulted ceiling, massive stone fireplace, and stained-glass windows, it's reminiscent of many a European cathedral. An adjacent lawn, shaded by mature trees, is a lovely spot for exchanging vows before moving inside for your wedding feast, where light from the floor-to-ceiling windows warms the redwood paneling and suffuses the Hall in a golden glow.
  * **Two charming smaller spaces are equally lovely, each with an al fresco terrace** perfect for ceremonies. The Seaborg Room is especially striking, with its open-beamed A-frame ceiling and wisteria-framed windows overlooking a peaceful green. Wherever you choose to celebrate, you'll be treated to delectable culinary delights and the thoughtful, warm service of the events staff—with over 100 years of events under their belt, you know you're in good hands.
