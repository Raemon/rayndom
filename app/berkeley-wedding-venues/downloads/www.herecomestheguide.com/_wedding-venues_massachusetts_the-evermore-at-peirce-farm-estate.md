## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **It's an elegant 19th-century estate in historic Topsfield.** The Colonial Revival mansion has been artfully restored and features countless antiques and period furnishings, and an ornate fireplace that'a favorite backdrop for indoor ceremonies.
  * **A quaint white-and-green barn hides a wonderful secret:** a dramatic interior that's certain to impress. Light streams in through high-set windows, filling the entire space with a romantic glow, and the soaring, three-story ceiling is hung with a breathtaking modern candelabra chandelier.
  * **Outdoor weddings can be held on the expansive lawn and grounds** , where you'll find plenty of pretty options for your ceremony, and ample space for a tent. And, of course, you're still invited to use the luxe suite inside the manor house for your day-of prep.
