## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Perched right on Port Townsend Bay’s sterling waterfront,** this stately turn-of-the-century gem began life as an alcohol manufacturing center, and has had many incarnations in its 100-plus year life span. Now home to a gracious inn, gardens, and event space, it continues to hold a special place in its home of charming Port Hadlock. 
  * **At your ceremony site on the lush lawn,** a pretty white wooden pergola frames the azure bay waters, and the Olympic Mountain Range can be seen in the distance. There’s a classically elegant ballroom for your reception, and dinner menus feature ingredients harvested from the Inn’s own edible gardens. 
  * **On-site boutique guest suites boast luxe amenities** like fireplaces and private balconies overlooking the bay, but here's the best part: Your stay here, (and your wedding rental fees) help support Bayside Housing & Services, whose mission is to provide transitional housing, meals, and supportive services to community members in need.
