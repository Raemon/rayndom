## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Built in 1927 as the St. Augustine's central bank,** this stately historic downtown treasure has been artfully renovated. The event spaces offer an intriguing mix of vintage and modern, and were designed with epic celebrations in mind.
  * **Architectural marvels like soaring Romanesque columns and dramatic inset arches** are the hallmark of the stunning Grande Ballroom, whose understated palette allows for a range of wedding themes and color schemes. State-of-the-art lighting and sound systems allow the space to be turned into the town's hottest nightclub with the touch of a button. 
  * **Guests will love ducking into The Vault Bar.** Housed behind the impressive steel doors of the building's original vault, it boasts a beautiful marble-and-granite bar and a cool, speakeasy-inspired vibe.
