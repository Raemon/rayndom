Personal wedding vows are such a sweet backdrop for ring shots.

This gorgeous bride chose a wedding dress with short sleeves and we are _loving it!_

White bouquets with an abundance of greenery are both trendy and gorgeous.

These powder blue bridesmaids' dresses are so pretty in this garden setting.

A greenery-covered cross is the sweetest backdrop for this couple's vows.

The most precious flower girls!

This sweet groom looks on as his bride walks down the aisle.

Baby blues, oh yes!

Flower crowns for the flower girls!

How adorable is this couple's shot?!

The "naked" table look is so hot right now, and we 100% approve!

Bistro lighting keeps the party going all night!
