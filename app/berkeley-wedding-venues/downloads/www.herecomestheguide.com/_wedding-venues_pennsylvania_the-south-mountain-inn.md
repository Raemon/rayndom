## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This mountaintop retreat wraps your wedding in woodland calm,** with leafy vistas, open skies, and that just-right feeling of being tucked away...but just minutes from Reading. You’ll have plenty of flexibility to craft your celebration, whether you envision an intimate micro-wedding or a grand, weekend-long getaway in the country.
  * **Say “I do” atop a woodsy patio, backed by a dramatic, miles-long vista** of the surrounding mountains and valleys. Larger celebrations continue al fresco, with possibilities as endless as the views: think a casual food truck reception, elegant tented fete, or dancing the night away under the stars. Inside, there are three lovely event spaces that offer a perfect fit for smaller gatherings.
  * **The bed & breakfast lodgings are plush and welcoming, **with ten lovely guest suites and a delectable home-cooked breakfast served each morning (and friendly mini-donkeys who love posing for the camera!). The atmosphere leans cozy-luxe, with a stone fireplace, wood floors, and twinkle lights setting the mood.
