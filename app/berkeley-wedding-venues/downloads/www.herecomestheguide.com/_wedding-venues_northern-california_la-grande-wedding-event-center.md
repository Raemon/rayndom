## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This exquisite 10-acre estate feels like it was plucked out of Tuscany** and placed in this pretty spot in the heart of the Bay Area. Owned and run by three generations of event planners, celebrations here are thoughtfully curated, impeccably executed, and supremely stress-free.
  * **The tranquil sounds of a gentle waterfall accompany your vows** in the gardens or lakeside gazebo, backed by the dramatic silhouette of Mt. Diablo. Cocktails in the shady Piazza Courtyard are followed by receptions beneath the romantic Pavilion Tent, which is draped in gauzy fabrics, string lights, and gleaming chandeliers.
  * **Affordable, inclusive pricing takes the anxiety out of the planning process,** with in-house catering that can accommodate various cultural and dietary needs, as well as the option to work with outside caterers of your choice. You'll also enjoy the dedicated service of their coordinators, planners, and staff, who are committed to bringing your unique vision to life.
