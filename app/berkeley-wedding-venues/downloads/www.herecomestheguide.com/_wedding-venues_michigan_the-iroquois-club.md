## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Custom-designed from the ground up,** this Detroit-convenient venue features a party-friendly layout, year-round hosting capabilities, and an inviting interior whose warm, neutral tones mesh with nearly all palettes and themes. 
  * **The Great Room definitely wows,** with its cathedral ceiling supported by handsome exposed wood beams and Appalachian cast iron trusses. A floor-to-ceiling fireplace crafted from Wisconsin ledge rock anchors the space, and creates a beautiful backdrop for ceremonies. 
  * **Comprehensive planning services are provided by the Club’s expert staff,** but you’re also welcome to DIY any aspects of your celebration you’d like—whichever option you choose, they’ll be there to support your vision and ensure everything goes swimmingly on the big day.
