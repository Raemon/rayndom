## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **The charm of a welcoming family ranch** **awaits** at this award-winning 10-acre horse ranch tucked away in the hills of Temecula, where sprawling pastures, lush green lawns, and towering cottonwood trees are set against a magical backdrop of magnificent granite boulders. 
  * **Say “I do” beneath the sprawling canopy of a 300-year-old oak,** draped in hundreds of glowing lights. Cocktails follow on the covered lanai, where an outdoor fireplace and large bar area encourage mingling, and receptions unfold in the rustic barn. 
  * **Your complete weekend experience includes cozy accommodations** inspired by classic Western design, each featuring hand-built wood-burning fireplaces, kitchens, a stylish dressing suite, and two bedrooms for the wedding party. Plus, a flexible vendor policy offers the freedom to craft your day exactly as you imagine, creating the feel of your own private countryside retreat.
