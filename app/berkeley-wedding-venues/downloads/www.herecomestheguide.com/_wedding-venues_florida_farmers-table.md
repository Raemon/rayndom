## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This wonderful restaurant has a warm, neighborhood feel** that flows throughout its many event spaces, and because it's directly adjacent to the Wyndham Hotel it's ultra-convenient for your overnight guests. 
  * **The Oak Room is gorgeous, paneled with reclaimed wood** and lit by romantic pillar candle chandeliers. There's also a light-filled, contemporary ballroom, and a tropical "terrace-in-the-round" overlooking the pool.
  * **Every ingredient on your menu will be cleanly and responsibly sourced** in keeping with the restaurant's commitment to creating beautiful, simple dishes free of hormones, pesticides, and antibiotics.
