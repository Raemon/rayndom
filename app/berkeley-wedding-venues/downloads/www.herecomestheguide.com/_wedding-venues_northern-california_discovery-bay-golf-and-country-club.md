## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set like an emerald at the heart of the tawny East Bay hills, this lovely country club** offers a perfect slice of paradise at a highly affordable price. Serene and sophisticated, surrounded by shade trees and tickled by breezes and birdsong, the rolling lawns, breezy patio, and Mediterranean-style clubhouse are brilliant environments for any affair.
  * **The beautiful dining room invites you in with its classic furnishings,** softly colored carpets and walls, and breathtaking views of the rolling fairways and lakes. Multiple levels of indoor lighting, including chandeliers, spots, and recessed illumination in the handsomely coved ceiling will spotlight your event to perfection. The adjacent veranda provides guests a chance to enjoy the fresh air between rounds on the dance floor.
  * **Framed by the country club's verdant, meticulously-groomed gardens and greens, the outdoor veranda** is a beautiful, sun-splashed setting for a wedding ceremony or _plein air_ gathering or reception. The north- and west-facing panorama takes in Mt. Diablo and rarely fades to black without an extravagant sunset and its finale of twinkling stars. The exquisitely manicured front lawn is another popular option, framed by clouds of colorful flowers and grand old pepper, willow, poplar, and ash trees.
