## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This lovely 1890 sandstone mansion, set in a sheltered canyon** tucked between two tree-covered ridges, was once the homestead of gold rush pioneer Henry Ellis. Today, it's a dreamy setting for celebrations, with a central location close to several East Bay freeways but a quiet country atmosphere that will give you the delicious feeling of being a million miles away.
  * **Garden-style ceremonies are held on an expansive, flower-lined lawn,** where a pretty wood-and-brick gazebo is backed by vibrant displays of azaleas and camellias. Fairy-tale photo ops abound on the sprawling property: capture romantic images before the century-old stone house, burbling fountains, and acres of working vineyards.
  * **Receptions unfold in the secluded Terrace Room, tucked away into the hillside** and sheltered by oak, eucalyptus and olive trees. Its vaulted ceiling and glass walls add to the feeling of spaciousness, while the surrounding deck gives guests a chance to dine al fresco at umbrella-shaded tables.
