## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A charming whitewashed adobe home sits at the heart of this historic ranch,** once part of an expansive orange and avocado farm from the 1900s. Today, it's a full-service wedding venue, offering generous all-inclusive packages along with the assistance of an experienced events team to help craft your perfect celebration.
  * **The flagstone Inner Courtyard exudes Old World warmth,** beautifully ensconced amid**** ivy-draped balconies, an abundance of potted flowers, and a sparkling three-tiered fountain. Off to one side is a wooden arbor, hung with stained-glass panels and entwined with vines, and chandeliers hanging above provide welcome sparkle to the scene.
  * **A pair of 200-year-old Mexican mesquite wood doors** open onto the Southwest-infused Taos Room, a gracious ballroom in the building adjacent to the main hacienda. Light floods the space through the skylit ceilings and row of French doors, illuminating the space's oversized fireplace, original artwork, and tiled stairs (which are perfect for a truly grand entrance).
