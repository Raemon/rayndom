## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Sweeping views of their pristine golf course offer a panoramic backdrop for your Front Lawn ceremony.** Worried about rain in Portland? No problem, just move the ceremony inside to the Ballroom where walls of windows showcase the views.
  * **The spacious Ballroom boasts a dramatic staircase of stone and polished wood,** as well as a rock fireplace, graceful arched windows, modern chandeliers and an attached patio. Plus, there’s plenty of room to create a lounge for cocktails and conversation.
  * **Only one wedding at a time means you get their full attention.** Whatever comes up, it’s nice to know that the staff is focused on your needs, and that the in-house catering team will work with you to create the perfect menu.
