## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **With its iconic, picture-postcard views of the Bay, this lush, hillside property** has been a beloved setting for grand celebrations since its creating in the 1920s. The dazzling panoramas encompass a remarkable range of sights—from the San Francisco skyline to the Golden Gate Bridge, Sausalito, Marin Headlands, Mount Tamalpais, and the San Rafael Bridge.
  * **Exchange vows on the Vista Deck, set on a knoll against a tableau of sparkling water,** boats, and distant hills, or say "I do" inside the Vista Room, where a crested bay window creates a stunning altar and a gas fireplace provides a warm, cozy feel. Then, pose for photos amid the picturesque grounds, an intriguing mix of groomed fairways and natural woodsy paths with old-growth trees and rustic ponds.
  * **You'll have your choice of two ballrooms inside the uniquely charming Clubhouse,** designed in the English Tudor style. Each maintains its original historic details, like vaulted ceilings, exposed beams, dramatic chandeliers, and dark wood floors, but both have also been updated with modern amenities... and you'll enjoy the world-class cuisine provided by their talented culinary team, who will help you choose from an array of hors d’oeuvres, elaborate buffets, beautifully prepared plated selections, and customized wedding cakes.
