## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set right along the Delaware River,** this special maritime museum presents a host of cool photo opportunities, including the bustling waterfront and two National Historic Landmark vessels: the imposing steel warship Olympia, and WWII submarine Becuna. 
  * **Outdoor ceremonies and receptions can be held on a terrace above the water,** and there’s plenty of space for a large tent if weather or sun is a concern. Indoor celebrations may be hosted in the Museum’s ballroom, its exhibit halls, or even aboard the Olympia herself.
  * **The Museum relies on public support,** and proceeds from events are an essential part of that support. When you get married here, you’ll know that you’ve contributed to a 60-year legacy of educating visitors about Philadelphia’s fascinating “river of history”.
