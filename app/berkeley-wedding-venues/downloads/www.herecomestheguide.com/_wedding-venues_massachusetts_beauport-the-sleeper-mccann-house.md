## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This breathtaking, utterly unique mansion set on a rocky ledge** overlooking Gloucester Harbor was once home to America's first professionally-recognized interior designer, Henry Davis Sleeper. Each of its 40 rooms is completely different in design, taking inspiration from a person, place, shape, color, or object.
  * **Your intimate wedding ceremony will be held on the home's stunning terrace,** surrounded by gardens that have been refurbished to reflect what they would have looked like at their most lovely, in the 1920s and 30s. 
  * **Rental fees help support Historic New England's stewardship** and preservation of Beauport and other important properties throughout the area. Your rental comes with a "thank you" membership to the organization, which includes free tours of this home and dozens of others.
