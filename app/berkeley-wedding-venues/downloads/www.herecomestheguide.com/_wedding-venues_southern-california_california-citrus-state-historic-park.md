## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set amid a fragrant citrus grove in Riverside,** this living museum**** is a remarkable testament to California’s rich history in the citrus industry. Blessed with over 250 acres of gracious groves of trees, historic outbuildings, and spacious, palm-studded lawns, it’s also a truly special place to say “I do.”
  * **The historic Craftsman-style Sunkist Center is the park’s crown jewel,** beautifully crafted with natural stone, warm wooden beams, and gracious windows that flood the space with light. An adjoining patio, illuminated with market lights and surrounded by citrus trees, creates a lovely indoor/outdoor flow.
  * **Nestled in the curve of a sun-kissed hillside you’ll find a pretty gazebo** and adjacent covered pavilion. Flowered trellises frame both sides, with the nearby rose garden creating a sweetly scented setting for ceremonies, intimate gatherings, and al fresco cocktail receptions. A built-in stage invites you to dance the night away.
