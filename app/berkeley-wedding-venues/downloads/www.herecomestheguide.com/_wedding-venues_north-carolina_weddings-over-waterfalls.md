## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A whimsical, custom-built home perched over a convergence of tranquil waterfalls high in the Blue Ridge Mountains,** this dreamy venue offers a secluded, natural escape for elopements and micro-weddings. 
  * **Wed on a little island at the fork of two creeks,** or on an elevated platform patio set between the waterfalls and forest. The reception area is covered by a white peaked tent, and can also serve as a beautiful space for dining and dancing. 
  * **Spend your wedding night in the wonderful creekside masterpiece,** whose 38 windows and skylights ensure you won’t miss a second of the view. Settle yourself on the deck’s swinging daybed, and be lulled into a nap by the gentle sounds of the falls.
