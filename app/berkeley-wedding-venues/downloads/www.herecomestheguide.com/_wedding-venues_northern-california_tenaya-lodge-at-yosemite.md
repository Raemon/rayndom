## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Set amid the awe-inspiring natural wonders of Yosemite National Park, this four-diamond lodge** is a masterful blend of the earthy and the contemporary, featuring natural materials like wood, stone, and leather that create a rich, warm ambiance. It's also Double Silver LEED-certified, and the cuisine is local and sustainable.
  * **Exchange vows on the Terrace, a second-story deck fringed with feathery pine trees,** then descend a flight of stairs to the open-sided Pavilion for dinner beneath its exquisite wood ceilings. For an indoor affair, opt for the modern Grand Ballroom or the intimate Forest Room, each offering exquisite mountain vistas.
  * **The park's rugged grandeur provides stunning backdrops for your wedding photos,** as well a wide range of activities to entertain your guests, ranging from scenic horseback riding tours to a plush in-house spa. Everyone will love the Yosemite 360 tours, which will whisk you to the park's most spectacular sights along with an expert guide (and a trail lunch!).
