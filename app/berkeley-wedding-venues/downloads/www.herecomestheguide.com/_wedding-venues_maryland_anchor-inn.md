  * **Set literally over Chesapeake Bay** , this waterfront wedding venue provides views of both the bay and Pleasure Cove Marina.
  * **Exchange vows on a covered deck** , with the marina and lush treelined coast behind you. Then dine and dance in the reception room, with its white wood-slat ceiling, hardwood floor, and wraparound windows affording water vistas.
  * **They offer comprehensive wedding planning assistance** from your first meeting through the day-of, and their dedicated planning website lets you review and confirm all your event details whenever you like.
