## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Originally built as a Catholic church in 1903,** this historic brick beauty has been lovingly renovated, maintaining its vintage character while adding essential party amenities. Parking is plentiful, and it’s within an easy drive of Pittsburgh.
  * **Soaring arched windows with leaded and stained glass fill the space with color and light,** and whimsical details like hand-painted murals and exposed brick and ductwork add a bit of eclectic glam. Additional spaces include an attached covered patio, and a quaint balcony overlooking the sanctuary. 
  * **You've got some super fun perks!** We love the “wow” factor created by a hundreds of balloons suspended overhead, and you have the option of ringing the 120 year-old church bells to celebrate the day. They’re dog-friendly, too!
