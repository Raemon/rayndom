## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **The raw majesty of Tonto National Forest** encircles this private venue perched above the azure waters of Bartlett Lake. It’s only 45 minutes from the heart of Phoenix, but feels utterly secluded, natural, and tranquil.
