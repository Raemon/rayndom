## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A working flower farm** spread across eleven dreamy acres just 60 miles west of Washington D.C., this wonderful spot boasts perennials, annuals, trees, and shrubs that bloom with year-round color. And with an on-site custom floral design team, your bouquets and décor will be spectacular. 
  * **There are so many beautiful places** around the grounds for your ceremony, and the Pavilion—a one-of-a-kind treasure build from fallen timber sourced from the surrounding woods—is perfect for rustic-elegant receptions. 
  * **An 18th Century farmhouse** can be used for your day-of preparations, and as weekend/wedding night accommodations for up to eight guests. Additional overnighters can make use of five dedicated camping spots, as well.

###### Additional Info

  * _Wollam Gardens_ offers the option to include a wedding coordinator in their wedding package while allowing the flexibility to bring in outside vendors. It is highly recommended that a full-service or day-of coordinator or a full-service caterer is hired to manage logistics. While family and friends can assist beautifully, the responsibilities often become more demanding than expected. Hiring a professional lets the couple and their guests fully relax and enjoy their special day.
