## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **“Breathtaking” doesn’t really begin to describe the views from this stunning Estes Park venue,** whose desirable spot between a dramatic granite crest and MacGregor Ranch boasts a sweeping panorama of the Continental Divide, Long’s Peak, and Lumpy Ridge. 
  * **The log Homestead was built in 1929 and once served as the ranch’s main residence;** it brings cozy, vintage vibes to intimate and mid-sized weddings. Larger celebrations are ideal in The Boulders, which features “mountain modern” design and a huge picture window framing a vista of striking rock formations. 
  * **On-site lodging is available within easy walking distance of the wedding venues,** and include both traditional suites and one, two, and three-bedroom vacation rentals. Throughout their stay, guests will enjoy incredible wildlife watching and convenient access to trails, fishing, rafting, and Rocky Mountain National Park.
