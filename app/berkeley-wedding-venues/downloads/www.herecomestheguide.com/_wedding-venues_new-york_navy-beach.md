## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **Set on a 200-foot private beach** , this laid back, family-friendly restaurant offers diners fabulous water views, along with some of the best sunsets in the Hamptons.
  * **You can celebrate indoors or out.** The bar/dining room overlooks the sand and sea through walls of glass, while the beach itself is ideal for an al fresco ceremony or tented event.
  * **Navy Beach specializes in fresh seafood** and locally-sourced produce, as well as a large variety of internationally-influenced seasonal menu items. The restaurant is also noted for having one of the largest selections of rosé wines in the area.
