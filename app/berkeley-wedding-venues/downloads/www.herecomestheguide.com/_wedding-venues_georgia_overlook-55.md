## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Blue Ridge Mountain views stretch for miles and miles from this secluded hilltop farm,** whose pastoral 55 acres boast dreamy, photo-friendly locales, including historic buildings, rolling pastures, a vineyard, flower gardens, a waterfall, and ponds. 
  * **You have so many beautiful places to celebrate,** among them, The Overlook, with its endless misty mountain vistas, The Willow Tree, whose namesake tree shelters romantic vows, and the Terrace Lawn, where you’ll find a graceful, vine-covered arbor and cozy stone wood-burning fireplace. 
  * **The dressing suites are so awesome—** we’re particularly in love with the den-style space set in Ledford Works, the farm’s working blacksmith shop. You can even arrange a group workshop with “Forged in Fire” finalist Caleb Ledford, where you’ll craft your own keepsake knife from a railroad spike!
