## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A stunning wraparound porch greets guests** at this charming Hill Country inn, which sits on 25 acres along the Guadalupe River. Family-run and ultra-welcoming, it's an awesome choice for a relaxing wedding weekend.
  * **Say "I do" in the lovely 1920s gazebo,** which was sculpted by artisan Dionicio Rodriguez from reinforced concrete to resemble real wood. Then, celebrate with an al fresco reception on the pretty grounds or on the spacious porch.
  * **Your package includes lodging for up to 50 guests** in the main house, cottages, and guest house. Settle in for the weekend and enjoy the pool, walking trails, river, and the historic nearby town of Comfort.
