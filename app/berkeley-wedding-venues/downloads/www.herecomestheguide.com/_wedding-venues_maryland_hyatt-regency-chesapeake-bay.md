## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located on over 342 waterfront acres,** this idyllic resort couldn't be more perfect for a wedding weekend escape. In addition to fantastic event venues and accommodations, it houses a spa, golf course, and private marina. 
  * **Your celebration space options, both indoors and out,** are all wonderful, and range from "waterside casual" to "ballroom formal." One of our favorite combos? An al fresco ceremony in front of the Grand Fireplace overlooking the Choptank River, followed by cocktails and dancing on the Crescent Pool patio. 
  * **They offer a nice selection of additions** (draped walls, outdoor trellises, etc.), awesome tech capabilities, and a top-notch events team that will help pull it all together…including pre- and post-wedding activities!
