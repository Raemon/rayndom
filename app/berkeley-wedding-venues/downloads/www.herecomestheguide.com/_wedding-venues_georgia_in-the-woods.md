## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Located on 250 private, woodsy acres, this venue boasts pretty views in every direction.** Nestled among the farm-inspired buildings, it features footbridges, a fire pit, a stone pool grotto, and whimsical touches like an antique gas pump.
  * **Ceremonies take place in the charming outdoor chapel** , an open-sided, wood-framed structure set with vintage church pews that faces a peaceful lake. After your vows, swing open the giant barn doors of the reception hall, and celebrate in modern-rustic style.
  * **Newlyweds can spend the night in the adorable honeymoon cabin** , complete with a spa overlooking the lake. You can also book the cabin for the night before the wedding—an extra bedroom makes it the perfect place for a wedding party sleepover.
