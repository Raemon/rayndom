## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **Boasting breathtaking mountain and valley vistas,** this historic ranch has been operated by the same family for generations. Its beautiful location near Marble is within minutes of campgrounds, hotels, and vacation rentals.
  * **Wed in a meadow with the sweeping Elk Range as your backdrop,** or on a bluff overlooking the river. Host cocktails surrounded by the majestic mountains and aspen & spruce trees, then dine and dance with the Colorado stars overhead (there’s ample space for a tent, if you wish.) 
  * **The rustic, cozy lodge has seven bedrooms,** each with an en suite bathroom, and also features a commercial kitchen, a hot tub, a spacious great room with a river rock fireplace, and decks overlooking the river.
