## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Combining a welcoming, carefree feel and high-end polish, this public golf course** is a true hidden gem. With graceful palm-lined entrance, cascading waterfalls, lakes, and lush year-round greenery, the natural setting is spectacular—and the imaginative and engaging event staff will help you take advantage of every element while carefully matching your vision and budget.
  * **Ceremonies on the palm-fringed Lakeview Patio are backed by a sparkling lake and fountain,** creating a truly picture-perfect scene. After the vows, guests can pause for a round on the handsome putting green and sip cocktails on the adjacent, multi-tiered patio. Meanwhile, you'll be whisked around the property in a special golf cart, snapping romantic photos amid the spectacular scenery.
  * **There's a beautiful reception room for every style and guest count,** ranging from the intimate Cypress and Doral Rooms to the Main Clubhouse, where a soaring beamed ceiling, soft, neutral tones, and floor-to-ceiling windows create a light, airy ambiance. The lovely Augusta and Broadmoor Rooms can be used separately or together, and for those who just want to slip away for some fresh air, the Pine Tree Patio provides outdoor seating with bistro lighting and views of the 18th hole.
