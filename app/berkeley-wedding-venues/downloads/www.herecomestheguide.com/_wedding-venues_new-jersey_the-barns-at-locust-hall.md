## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A 17th-century farmhouse mansion, historic barns, and original outbuildings** on a sprawling 315-acre property create a one-of-a-kind wedding venue. Rolling pastures, a working farm, and wide-open views offer an array of celebration sites.
  * **Relax and get ready in the fieldstone-and-clapboard mansion** , with fully equipped dressing areas including a private patio. Then exchange vows under a handmade arch on the Ceremony Lawn, which provides unobstructed vistas.
  * **The Stone Barn, perfect for cocktails or intimate receptions, boasts rustic beams** , a vaulted ceiling, wagon wheel chandeliers, and an incredibly photogenic exterior. Or, opt for the Breezeway Barn, where the sliding doors give you a true indoor/outdoor reception—and an adjacent patio invites dining beneath the stars.
