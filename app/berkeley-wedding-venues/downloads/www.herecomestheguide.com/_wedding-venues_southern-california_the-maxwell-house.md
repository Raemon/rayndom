## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Built in the****Mediterranean Italianate style****, this stately 1929 mansion** is now the home of the non-profit Western Justice Center... and an exquisite setting for weddings. The home itself is truly magnificent, with a grand Palladian entry, hand-painted panels that adorn the coffered ceilings, and a pretty, bistro-lit courtyard perfect for outdoor ceremonies.
  * **You'll have all-day exclusive access to the space,** including the living & dining rooms, foyer, mezzanine, kitchen, and dressing suites, along with beautiful wood and Chiavari chairs, a handcrafted arch, a vintage bar, and ample AV equipment. It's anything but a wedding factory: only 18 weddings are hosted here each year, ensuring each one is truly special.
  * **Every cent of your affordable rental fee goes directly towards the****Western Justice Center,** which supports programs that work with youth and educators to promote conflict resolution and social justice, confront bias and oppression, and break the school-to-prison pipeline.
