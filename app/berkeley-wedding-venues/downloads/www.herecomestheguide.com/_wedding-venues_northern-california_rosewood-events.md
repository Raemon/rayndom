## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Surrounded on all sides by 600 acres of sun-kissed meadows,** redwood groves, and fragrant gardens, this enchanting estate feels worlds away from the hustle and bustle... all while sitting pretty just 15 minutes from downtown Petaluma. 
  * C**apture a magical first look beneath a pergola draped with vining wisteria,** or wait for the "I do"s at one of the beautiful al fresco ceremony sites. Photo ops are endless here: snap romantic pics amid the colorful flower gardens, in the daisy and lavender fields, on a picture-perfect wooden footbridge, and—our favorite—on the ridge-top as golden hour gleams.
  * **There's plenty of room to mingle, dine, dance, and enjoy the stunning views:** serve cocktails from the adorable willow-shaded bar, gather around cozy fire pits or under an open-air pavilion, and twirl the night away in the pretty reception tent, adorned with chandeliers, drapery, and sparkling lights.
