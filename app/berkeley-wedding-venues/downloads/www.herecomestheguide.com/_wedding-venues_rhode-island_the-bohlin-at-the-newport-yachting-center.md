## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Newport is the quintessential New England town.** With a quaint downtown dotted with shops and restaurants, cobblestone streets, charming coastal cottages, and a harbor fit for a postcard, Newport embodies everything an Atlantic seaside town should be…and The Bohlin is right at the heart of it.
  * **Ceremonies and receptions are held directly on the waterfront.** The Sunset Terrace looks out over the bustling, picturesque harbor and iconic Newport Bridge. There’s an elegant climate-controlled tent, and the expansive patio also features coastal-chic teak furniture on which to lounge and enjoy the sights.
  * **There are great opportunities to add character to your celebration.** The staff at The Bohlin is able to arrange a number of fun additions, like arriving at your ceremony by boat, a rehearsal dinner clambake, or a wedding party sailing excursion.
