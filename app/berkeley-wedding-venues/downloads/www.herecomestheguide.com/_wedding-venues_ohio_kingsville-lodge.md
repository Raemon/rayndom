## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This 14-acre private retreat sits just 45 minutes from Erie, PA** and only an hour from Cleveland, OH and feels more like your own personal resort than a wedding venue. Forest views, a recreational pond, and space for up to 50 guests create the perfect intimate setting.
  * **Your ceremony can happen pondside, before a gorgeous waterfall feature,** or anywhere around the scenic property, with flexible indoor and outdoor reception options and tons of in-house services available to make the process a breeze. Officiant? You got one. Photography? Affordable packages incoming. Tables & chairs? Of course—and they're pretty ones, too!
  * **Weekend packages include two nights of lodging for up to 16 guests** plus access to hot tub, game rooms, boats, and fire pit. You're getting a whole weekend destination where everyone bonds over arcade games and pond activities!
