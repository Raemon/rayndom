## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Taking its name from the Hebrew word for “night”,** this collection of special event venues is operated by the team at CookNSolo, who boast decades of restaurant experience…including an impressive six James Beard awards. 
  * **At Lilah, you’ll find cool, urban-chic vibes** with impressive details, like a dramatic sliding wall of vintage industrial windows that separates the welcome lobby from the main hall. A private suite is available for your prep, and a stylish loft adds additional room for mingling.
  * **The contemporary Weitzman National Museum of American History** offers flexible, light-filled spaces in the heart of downtown Philadelphia. Spread across five stories, your options include the immersive “Only in America” Gallery, and 5th on 5th Ballroom, where an attached terrace serves up an iconic view of Independence Hall.
