## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Purpose-built with flawless celebrations in mind,** this elegant venue has a convenient central New Jersey location, top-notch, modern amenities, and truly lovely event spaces both indoors and out. 
  * **Welcome guests with a flute of champagne** in the ivory-toned Cocktail Room or light-filled Winter Room. The stunning Grand Ballroom features a dramatic coffered ceiling hung with crystal chandeliers, and can be easily divided for intimate affairs. 
  * **In the Villa Garden you’ll find bountiful seasonal flowers,** a tranquil water feature, and a Greek Revival-inspired gazebo. It's the perfect spot to sneak away for a quiet photo session, but can also host pre-function events and ceremonies.
