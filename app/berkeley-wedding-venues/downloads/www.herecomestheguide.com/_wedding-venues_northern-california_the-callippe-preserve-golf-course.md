## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **Just 15 minutes from downtown Pleasanton, you'll find this emerald gem amid the East Bay Hills.** At the heart of the property, a dignified California ranch-style clubhouse sits on a promontory overlooking the entire Tri-Valley area, and is designed to complement the natural landscape.
  * **The airy Vista Veranda affords a spectacular 270-degree valley panorama,** presiding over the verdant golf course and surrounding landscape. Glass walls on two adjoining sides open to allow summer breezes to pass through, while an open fourth wall can be draped to create a more traditional banquet feel.
  * **Your options here are as limitless as the vistas, so let your imagination soar.** The property’s on-site event coordinator is passionate and adept at customization, and the California-style cuisine, thoughtfully prepared and beautifully presented by the experienced food & beverage manager and staff, is as fresh and exhilarating as the surroundings.
