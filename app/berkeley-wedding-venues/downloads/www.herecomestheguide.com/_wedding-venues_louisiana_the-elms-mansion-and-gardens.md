## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This historical Garden District mansion on St. Charles Avenue** dates back to the 1800s. It exemplifies the grandeur of New Orleans Italianate architecture, including an imported hand-carved marble mantel, ornamental cornices, and gold sconces.
  * **The grand, wood-accented interiors are beautifully appointed with period furnishings** and elegant architectural details, as in the spectacular 48-foot grand ballroom lined with jeweled windows.
  * **A gorgeously landscaped garden offers a romantic ceremony location.** The white gazebo provides a lovely focal point and is especially beautiful draped with the flowers of your choice. In the evening, festoon lights strung over the stone terrace create an intimate glow.
