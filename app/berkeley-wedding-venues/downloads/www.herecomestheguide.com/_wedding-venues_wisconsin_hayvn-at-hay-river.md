## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

  * **Rustic charm meets modern elegance in this lovely property,** tucked**** into the rolling hills of Western Wisconsin just an hour from the Twin Cities. Affordable pricing and a flexible vendor policy provide endless possibilities, with a welcoming event staff to help you craft your perfect day, stress-free.
  * **A quaint glass greenhouse provides a lovely backdrop** for ceremonies, with sweeping vistas visible on either side and through the walls of windows. Or, opt for an exchange of vows elsewhere on the property, where you’ll find lovely views of lush forest and pastoral countryside around every corner.
  * **The rustic gambrel-style barn is a lovely spot for dinner,** with soaring, curved walls and exposed timber beams adorned with chandeliers. The adjacent lawn, fire pit, and stone parlor lounge provide additional gathering space, with the option to host the whole celebration al fresco when the weather permits.
