## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

**• It has a relaxed, “out West” atmosphere:** Located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, this 4,200-acre working cattle ranch hosts events that range from down-home barbecues to black-tie affairs. 

**• The event spaces are unique:** The Pavilion is perfect for a candlelit reception or a large corporate picnic, while the James Marshall Manor House B&B lends itself to more intimate gatherings. For a fun setting, check out the Marriott Forks Western Town (a replica of an Old West Main Street), where you can arrive by hay wagon or on horseback.

**• Horse lovers will rejoice:** Horseback riding is a major pastime here—take one of their trail rides and you’ll cross over creeks, go through pastures and woods, and pass by grazing cattle.
