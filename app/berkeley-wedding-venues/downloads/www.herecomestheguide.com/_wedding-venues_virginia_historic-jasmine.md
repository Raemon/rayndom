## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A hidden gem tucked on 40 landscaped acres,** this exquisite riverside estate**** exudes a sense of timeless charm…and it’s all yours to explore. During the day, you can capture romantic photos among the towering magnolias, blooming cherry trees, and burbling fountains. At night, the entire property is illuminated in thousands of glowing lights, where you’ll find a sense of magic and wonder around every corner.
  * **There’s a dreamy setting to match any vision, from fairy-tale forests to gracious gardens.** Exchange vows among the trees at the Chapel in the Woods, backed by a sleek white chapel façade, or opt to say “I do” on a verdant lawn beneath an eight-pillared Garden Pergola. Receptions unfold across a series of lovely, interconnected spaces—from a bistro-lit cocktail hour in the Walnut Tree Lounge to dancing the night away in the permanent Reception Tent.
  * **The lovingly restored 1910 Manor House is your home base for the day** —**or the weekend,** if you choose to take advantage of the seven plush guest suites. There are dedicated dressing spaces for the wedding parties, each furnished with gilded mirrors and photogenic antique furnishings, a playful vintage Tavern Room, and easy access to the outdoor event spaces just steps away.
