## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **A rare gem in the heart of Brunswick,** this 150 year-old building’s historic architecture has undergone an artful restoration, preserving its vintage charm while adding essential modern amenities.
  * **The space is filled with light streaming in through towering arched windows,** and shines with photo-friendly original features like a pressed tin ceiling, converted oil-lamp lighting fixtures, and a 1909 grand piano.
  * **All-inclusive packages make planning a snap,** and you have the option to add on use of their beautifully appointed one-bedroom dressing suite for your day-of mingling and preparations.
