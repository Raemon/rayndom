## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This Tuscan-inspired estate tucked among vineyards and oak groves** feels truly secluded despite its fabulous location in San Luis Obispo, midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco and just minutes from Pismo Beach, Edna Valley, and downtown Paso Robles. The region's temperate climate enhances the venue's airy Mediterranean feel, with indoor and outdoor spaces that easily flow together.
  * **Blending Old World elegance with modern luxury, the two-story Villa** is a custom-designed marvel adorned with grand staircases, sparkling crystal chandeliers, reclaimed wood beams, and easy access outside. Here, you can exchange vows before a dramatic 40-foot waterfall, play bocce on the soft lawns, and snap romantic photos amid the mature oaks, tranquil ponds, and gorgeous stone walkways and bridges.
  * **The Villa's three plush multi-room suites and a charming detached cottage** sleep up to 18 of your loved ones, making it perfect for a destination Italian-inspired wedding... no passport required. And, because the property is family-owned and -operated, every detail holds a personal touch, with warm hospitality and thoughtful curation every step of the way.
