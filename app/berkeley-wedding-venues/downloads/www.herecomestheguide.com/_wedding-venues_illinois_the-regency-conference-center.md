## Why You'll Love This Place

##### A Here Comes The Guide Wedding Venue Review

Read More Show Less

  * **This stately event center offers stunning lake views** from their Piazza Garden, a manicured ceremony site complete with pergola. After snapping photos on the grounds, head inside for a group shot on their curvy staircase.
  * **The dazzling Venetian Lobby is spectacular for cocktails.** Its soaring two-story space makes a perfect segue to the Tuscany Grand Ballroom, where a soft color palette creates an elegant backdrop for up to 850 guests.
  * **Seamless planning and adjacent lodging at the Hampton Inn** are just two of the perks you'll find here. Complimentary parking, a room for getting ready, a honeymoon suite with breakfast, special guest room rates, and earned points sweeten the deal.
