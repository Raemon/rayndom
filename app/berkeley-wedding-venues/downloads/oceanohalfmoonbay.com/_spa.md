## ADD-ON’S

__

## FAQ's

____ Do I need to arrive earlier than my appointment time?

Yes, please arrive at least 15 minutes prior to your appointment to allow time for check-in and to complete a brief intake form. Late arrivals may shorten your treatment time, as sessions must end on schedule to accommodate the next guest. The full value of your service will still apply.

____ Do we need to bring anything with us to the spa?

No need to bring anything—robes, slippers, towels, hairdryers, and all essentials are provided for your convenience.

____ What do we wear during body treatments?

Your level of undress is entirely your personal preference. Many guests choose to fully undress for body treatments; however, we always use professional draping and prioritize your comfort and modesty.

____ Is there an age limit to use the spa?

All guests must be 18 years of age or older to access the spa. Individuals under the age of 18 are not permitted in the spa facilities or treatment rooms.

____ What is your cancelation policy?

We kindly ask that any cancellations or modifications to your appointment be made at least 48 hours in advance to avoid any charges. Cancellations made within 48 hours of the scheduled appointment or no-shows will be subject to a charge of 50% of the total service cost. If you have any questions, please contact us directly! [(650)263-2008](tel:\(650\)263-2008).

____ What amenities do you offer?

We offer a private steam room, available for 30-minute sessions, either prior to another service or as a standalone experience. Reservations are required due to its exclusive nature. While we do not have a hot tub or whirlpool, we are pleased to provide our Soothing Soaks for your relaxation.

____ Are there shower rooms/ an area to get ready after services?

We offer private shower rooms equipped with vanities that include all essential amenities such as hairdryers, curling irons, hairspray, mouthwash, combs, and more. Reservations are required upon booking due to the exclusive nature of these facilities. Towels, robes, slippers, and shower products all stocked in shower room.

____ Are there day passes available?

We are an appointment-based spa, and all services and amenities must be reserved individually in advance. We do not offer package deals, and all services are provided in a private setting to ensure a personalized experience.

____ Is there an area to hang out in before/ after my appointment?

Our spa features a comfortable lounge where you can relax, complete your intake forms, and settle in before your appointment. After your service, you’re welcome to unwind in the lounge and enjoy our complimentary spa water and tea. Please note that the lounge is a shared space where other guests may be checking in or out, so it is not a private area.

____ How are spa services scheduled, and who provides them?

All services are provided by our certified massage therapists and can be booked directly with our spa front desk. We’re happy to assist you by phone at (650) 263-2008, in person Thursday through Monday from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm, or online by clicking the link below. Scheduling in advance helps ensure a seamless experience and allows us to pair you with the ideal provider and treatment for your stay.
