# Hike & Sip: Easy & Moderate September 13th

September 13, 2025 @ 5:00 pm \- 8:30 pm

[Tickets – Easy Hike 5 PM](http://14884.blackbaudhosting.com/14884/tickets?tab=2&txobjid=ad56113b-06c9-44d7-bdd6-9be959a5d6ef) [Tickets – Moderate Hike 6:30 PM](http://14884.blackbaudhosting.com/14884/tickets?tab=2&txobjid=2ae2de55-7e8f-48cb-8389-e4522979824a)

Experience an unforgettable evening of nature, history, and stargazing with Hike & Sip, a program designed for adults 21 and over. Explore the majestic Redwood forest, guided by Chabot’s knowledgeable outdoor educators, and learn about the ecosystem, the cultural heritage of the Ohlone peoples, and Oakland’s rich history.

Enjoy a beautiful sunset hike with two options to suit your pace:

**Easy Hike:** 5:00 PM, approximately 1.5 miles, ±150 ft gain, 60-75 minutes. Please plan to arrive at 4:40 PM for check in.

**Moderate Hike:** 6:30 PM, approximately 2-3 miles, ±230-410 ft gain, 90-120 minutes. Please plan to arrive at 6:10 PM for check in.

Join us for a special edition of 6:30PM Moderate Hike & Sip with special guest, Naturalist Michael Charnofsky.

Michael worked for 12 years as a Naturalist for the Los Angeles County Outdoor Science School, which included leading many night hikes. For the past 19 years he has worked as a Naturalist for the East Bay Regional Park District, and he loves collaborating with Chabot Space & Science Center.

After your hike, unwind on Chabot’s Observation Deck with drinks and charcuterie. End the night with stargazing through telescopes (weather permitting) and star stories brought to life under the night skies.

**Tickets are $40 per person and include two drink tickets (beer, wine, or non-alcoholic beverages) and refreshments. This program is for adults 21+.**

For a comfortable experience, we recommend wearing layers, sturdy shoes, and bringing a water bottle, mosquito repellent, and a flashlight for evening hikes.

**Additional Information**

Hikes may be canceled due to severe weather or low enrollment. In such cases, tickets will be refunded or rescheduled. Tickets may also be rescheduled with at least 48 hours’ notice, subject to availability. Animals are not permitted on hikes.

To participate, complete our [Hiking Waiver & Consent Form](https://chabotspace.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Chabot-2025-Hiking-Waiver.pdf) prior to arrival, and bring your ticket(s) for easy check-in.

**Group Hikes**

Private group hikes can be arranged by contacting [groupsales@chabotspace.org](mailto:groupsales@chabotspace.org).

Join us for a unique adventure combining scenic trails, fascinating stories, and a starry evening you won’t forget!
