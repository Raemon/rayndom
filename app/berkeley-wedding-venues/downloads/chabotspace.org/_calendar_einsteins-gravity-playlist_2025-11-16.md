Event Series:  [ Einstein’s Gravity Playlist  ](https://chabotspace.org/series/einsteins-gravity-playlist/)

# Einstein’s Gravity Playlist

November 16, 2025 @ 2:00 pm \- 3:00 pm

**23 minutes  
Ages 8 and up**

Einstein’s Gravity Playlist is an original planetarium show that explores the ripples in space-time known as gravitational waves. Albert Einstein first predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916, and a century later, scientists detected these waves using incredibly precise laser technology here on Earth. In this show, viewers follow Lucia, a PhD student in physics, on an exploration of how gravitational waves are formed, how they move through the universe, and how scientists like her work to hear them.
