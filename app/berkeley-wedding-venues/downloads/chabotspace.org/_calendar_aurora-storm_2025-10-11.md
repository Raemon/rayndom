Aurora Storm explores the captivating northern lights and how different cultures and explorers have experienced them. Produced by the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute and the University of Alaska Museum of the North. The show teaches about the causes of the aurorae and how humans who live beneath their shimmering light are inspired by what they see. Quotes from the written journals of past Arctic explorers and indigenous people share stories of how they regarded the aurorae.
