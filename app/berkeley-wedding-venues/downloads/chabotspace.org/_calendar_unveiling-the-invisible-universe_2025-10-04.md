# Unveiling the Invisible Universe

October 4, 2025 @ 11:00 am \- 12:00 pm

### Unveiling the Invisible Universe

**28 minutes  
Ages 8 and up **

For thousands of years humans observed the light coming from the night sky with their eyes. In the beginning of the 17th century, the invention of the telescope revolutionized our knowledge of the Universe. Finally, in the 20th century with the advent of rockets, it became possible to go above the Earth’s atmosphere and observe X-ray and gamma ray radiation which are the marks of the hot and violent Universe. But it is not only light that can give us information about the cosmos. Neutrinos and cosmic rays also provide vital information. Finally, the detection by the LIGO experiment of gravitational waves from two merging black holes opened a new window in astrophysics. This fulldome show presents images of the cosmos as revealed by all these different messengers.
