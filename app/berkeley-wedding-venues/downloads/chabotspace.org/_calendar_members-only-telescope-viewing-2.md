# Members Only Telescope Viewing

September 28, 2025 @ 8:00 pm \- 10:00 pm

## 

## **Get a Closer Look at the Stars!**

### **2025********First Glance Series******

**Members Only Telescope Viewing on the Observation Deck**

_**Free admission – Members only**_

Unlock the mysteries of the universe at these **quarterly Members Only stargazing events**. Don’t miss this cozy cosmic experience with telescopes and hot chocolate. Members of all ages will observe the wonders of the cosmos through our historical telescopes, offering a rare chance to see celestial sights with expert guidance from members of the Eastbay Astronomical Society.

### Featured Talk

**Exploding Stars, Dark Energy, and the Runaway Universe by Jeffrey Silverman**

Some of the most energetic and fascinating objects in the Universe are exploding stars known as supernova. These huge outbursts come from the violent deaths of stars and can become brighter than the entire galaxy in which they’re found. Observations of distant supernova were the first evidence that the expansion of the Universe is speeding up with time, instead of slowing down. This totally unexpected behavior is likely due to “dark energy”, which is one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in modern science.
