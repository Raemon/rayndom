### 

## **$10 adults, $5 kids and seniors, and FREE for Members**

### **All-ages, family-friendly**

Are we alone in the universe? Or could there be other forms of life out there, waiting far away in the vast expanse of space? Hear from researchers, astrobiologists and astronomers on the possibility of extraterrestrial life and distant exoplanets that could sustain it. Show off your best out-of-this-world attire by wearing your best alien-themed costume, engage in hands-on alien crafts then take a trip across the universe in our Planetarium – who knows what could be lurking among the stars?

### Timed Activities

6:00 – 9:00PM | Lab 1  
**Decoding Images from Space  
**Become a space detective and uncover the hidden stories in real astronomical images.

6:00 – 9:00PM | Lab 1**  
Secret Signals  
**Try your hand at cracking mysterious codes, just like scientists searching the skies for messages from beyond.

6:00 – 9:00PM | Lab 1 **  
Disappearing Messages  
**Write and reveal secret notes using light and science—perfect for a would-be alien. 

6:30PM | [Planetarium](https://chabotspace.org/visit/planetarium/)**  
****Worlds Beyond Earth  
**(25m) What have 50 years of space exploration taught us about the planets and moons closest to us? With each probe and spacecraft launched into the unknown, scientists discover more about the surprisingly dynamic, active, and varied nature of the worlds that share our solar system, and gain a deeper understanding of the unique conditions that make life on our home planet possible. 

6:30pm | Meet at Classroom 2  
**LifeQuest: Searching for Life in Chabot’s Backyard  
**What makes life…alive? Join Chabot educators on a short, guided walk as we scavenge for living (and non-living) things under the shade of Chabot’s majestic telescopes. Together, we will create a shared definition for life on Earth and dive into the search for extraterrestrial life in the cosmos.

6:30 – 8:30PM | Studio 3  
**Career Access Youth Showcase: Exploring the Sun with[MUSE](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/muse/)  
**Discover how science communicators are opening windows into the mysteries of our star! Join the Galaxy Explorers as they share hands-on demonstrations inspired by NASA’s upcoming MUSE (Multi-slit Solar Explorer) mission. Explore how astronomers use spectroscopy to decode sunlight, investigate the Sun’s magnetism and energy, and uncover the cutting-edge technologies that make solar research possible. Through interactive activities, these youth leaders will connect visitors to the real science behind space weather, solar flares, and the future of solar exploration.

6:30 – 9:30PM | Observation Deck**  
[SIPREME Hot Chocolate](https://www.sipremechocolate.com/)  
**Stop by SIPREME Chocolate of Alameda for a steaming cup of out-of-this-world hot chocolate, right outside of Chabot’s historic telescopes!

**Interstellar Intruders with[Astro Everywhere](https://www.astroeverywhere.com/) _  
_** Our Solar System is currently host to some interstellar visitors – not aliens, but comets from another star! Learn about our own cometary population and what makes these visitors different and scientifically fascinating in a 20-minute live planetarium show.  
**Astro Everywhere** brings the astronomy to YOU! From breaking astronomy headlines to telescopes or a planetarium at events, Astro Everywhere tries to connect Bay Area audiences with the night sky and the universe beyond it.

7:30PM | [Planetarium](https://chabotspace.org/visit/planetarium/)

**ARE WE ALONE? with Dr. Pascal Lee**  
Are we alone in the universe? In recent years, scientists have made amazing discoveries about distant planets, the origins of life on Earth, and the possibility of interstellar travel. These breakthroughs are helping researchers to reevaluate just how likely it is that humans will ever make contact with intelligent extraterrestrial lifeforms. Join Dr. Pascal Lee of the SETI Institute as he takes us on a journey through the cosmos to understand the likelihood of finding life out there, and why advanced civilizations like our own may be exceedingly rare. 

8:30PM | Observation Deck  
**Star Stories*** **  
**In addition to the Greek and Roman Classical Myths, you’ll hear Native American stories, as well as lore from India, Ancient Egypt, Viking Scandinavia, Ghana, Pacific Islands such as Hawaii, Kenya, and who knows where else?
