## 21+ General Admission: $25

### **[Members](https://chabotspace.org/join-and-give/membership/) receive $10 off** – make sure you log in!

Doors open at 7PM | Show starts at 7:30PM

Prepare to celebrate science with **outrageous humor, space-inspired drag fashions, drinks and snacks, an out-of-this world floor show** and a galaxy of high-heeled fun hosted by local drag superstar VERA! and featuring performances by Helixir, Kai Kai Bee Michaels, Cy Berspace, and Sally Limón! And there’s a bar with themed cocktails and snacks!

### 

**Cy Berspace**

Cy Berspace is a trans conceptual artist and Drag performer based in the Bay Area. Through sculpture, installation, and performance he gives form to semiotic and social boundaries meant to govern our identity, sense of worth, and communal relations. Their performance work lives in a contemporary and almost ready-made aesthetic, uniting the artist’s hand with the robot’s manufactured one. His practice is an amalgamation of influences ancient and new, from Greek ruins to TikTok dance trends. They make work that holds space to witness and experience both dissonant and harmonious meetings of materials, concepts, and forms.

****

**Helixir**

Born and raised in Oakland, Helixir did drag as a hobby until August 2022. That’s when they quit their job, won the [SF Drag King of the Year](http://www.sfdragkingcontest.com/bios.php) competition, and became a professional king, all in the span of a week. Since then, they’ve joined the [Rebel Kings of Oakland](https://rebelkingsoakland.squarespace.com/), a performance troupe based at the White Horse Bar. They’ve also participated in several well-attended performances in New York and in the Bay Area, most recently at the Castro Street Fair. Helixir’s performances are always fun, always flamboyant, and more often than not, very emo.

### 

**KaiKai Bee Michaels**

KaiKai is a Bay area drag performer and cosplay artist with a passion for social justice and community care. They specialize in performances that are often fun yet thought provoking or deeply emotional as a reflection of culture and their own personal feelings. KaiKai is a co-host/producer of several shows in SF and the East Bay. They delight in always bringing something new and refreshing to queer art and are not afraid of sharing their stories with others.

### 

### 

### 

### 

**Sally Lim****ón**

Sally Limón is the East Bay’s Saltiest, Sourest, and Shortest Chicana Diva! She brings the audience to the stunning intersection of camp, glamour and more camp! She is an up and coming hostess, actress, singer, and wig stylist but she does drag because of her love of the LGBTQIA+ community. Remember to always Live, Laugh, and Limón!

### 

### 

### 

### 

**VERA!**

VERA! is an Armenian-American nonbinary drag king. They are the co-host of the Rebel Kings of Oakland, oldest drag king troupe on the West Coast; co-host of Save Her! environmental drag show with Pattie Gonia; Creative Director of Drag Story Hour SF; and board member of Oaklash Bay Area Drag Festival. VERA! is Mx. Starsearch, Saint Rebellious sainted by Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, and proud drag father of the House of Pack with 38 children and a dozen grandchildren and great grandchildren.
