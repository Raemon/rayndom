Kids tickets come with a free pumpkin!

[Buy Tickets](https://14884.blackbaudhosting.com/14884/tickets?tab=2&txobjid=e614e844-e802-4e2c-a26e-3027e369d1c3)

Get in the Halloween spirit with a night of cosmic chills and family thrills. Join us for a frightfully fun event featuring ooey gooey science demos, creepy crafting, pumpkin decorating, and not-so-scary storytime! As the sun sets, explore the night’s sky in our historic telescope domes and learn about spooky astronomical phenomena. This is a rain or shine event – we’ll see you soon!

### On the Observation Deck

**SIPREME Hot Chocolate**  
Stop by SIPREME Chocolate of Alameda for a steaming cup of out-of-this-world hot chocolate, right outside of Chabot’s historic telescopes! The perfect stargazing companion! This is no ordinary hot chocolate — it’s made with shaved chocolate bar, giving it added richness and depth. Four fabulous flavors will be available in either 2% or oat milk. For more information about SIPREME, visit [www.sipremechocolate.com](http://www.sipremechocolate.com/).

**Pumpkin Patch**  
Kids get a free pumpkin with admission to this event! Stop by the patch on the Observation Deck to pick your perfect pumpkin to take home. Then check out our decoration station to bring it to life with paint pens & fun stickers!

**6:30pm – Spooky Star Stories**  
Star mythology isn’t always nice. Join storyteller Doug Olsen at sunset for some spooky scary star stories from around the world!

**Telescopes Open**  
Get a glimpse into the stars through our historic telescopes! Weather permitting, this is your chance to see planets, stars and more. Our observatory domes house the Center’s 8-inch (Leah, 1883), and 20-inch (Rachel, 1916) refracting telescopes, along with a 36-inch reflecting telescope (Nellie, 2003).

**Boo Bubbles**  
What do you get when you combine dry ice and soap? Ghostly, smoke-filled bubbles, that’s what!

**Decorate a Trick-or-Treat Bag**  
Start your adventure by decorating your very own trick-or-treat bag, then take it along as you explore! Collect goodies at each activity station and fill it up with sweet surprises from the haunted spaceship.

**Dark Matter: Searching for Invisible Particles**

Join volunteers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for an introduction to the spooky & wonderful world of Dark Matter! Guests will have a chance to use special detectors to visualize the unseen, ghostly particles that surround us here on Earth and conduct an experiment to learn how to search for Dark Matter out in space!

### In Studio 3

**Haunted Spaceship**  
A mysterious starship has crash-landed at Chabot! Rumor has it, it’s abandoned, but no one knows what happened to the crew. Some say it’s harboring some kind of strange alien life inside its shadowy corridors. Are you brave enough to step inside & see for yourself? Bring your family to journey through creaky control rooms, glowing surprises, and strange cosmic sounds in this kid-friendly haunted house adventure.
