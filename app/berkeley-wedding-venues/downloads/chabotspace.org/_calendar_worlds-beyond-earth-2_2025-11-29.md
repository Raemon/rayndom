# World’s Beyond Earth

November 29, 2025 @ 2:00 pm \- 3:00 pm

**25 minutes  
****Ages 6 and up**

What have 50 years of space exploration taught us about the planets and moons closest to us? With each probe and spacecraft launched into the unknown, scientists discover more about the surprisingly dynamic, active, and varied nature of the worlds that share our solar system, and gain a deeper understanding of the unique conditions that make life on our home planet possible. 

Based on authentic scientific data from groundbreaking space missions, Worlds Beyond Earth takes viewers on an exhilarating adventure through our cosmic neighborhood. Immersive visualizations showcase the solar system with unprecedented accuracy, including a landing on the cratered surface of our own Moon, a dramatic flight through the swirling rings of Saturn, and soaring encounters with distant worlds of active volcanoes and buried oceans. This film is narrated by Lupita Nyong’o.
