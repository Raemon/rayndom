In just under an hour you can go from standing in the shadows of the Golden Gate Bridge to sipping on a glass of Rosé while staring out at the picturesque vineyards of the Napa or Sonoma Valley.

## Alcatraz Island

The infamous island reveals complex histories of American justice, incarceration, and the struggle for Native American civil rights. And on a clear day, it’s worth a visit simply for the ferry ride and panoramic bay views. Please note: There is no admission fee for Alcatraz itself, but you must purchase ferry-service tickets, which often sell out in advance.
