# The Art of K9 Obedience with Jennifer Sharpe

### Package Starts at $799

Cavallo Point has teamed up with elite dog trainer Jennifer Sharpe of HighPerformanceK9.com to offer a one-night stay and training package designed for dog owners who are serious about results. This is your chance to experience Jennifer’s exclusive PRF© (Pressure Release Forward) method, an intensive, hands-on small group dog training session that delivers real, lasting behavioral changes.

From aggressive behavior to real world obedience, Jennifer brings you, your dog, and your training protocol together to form a deeper, working relationship. This in-depth 2.5 hour small group training session is designed to impact behavioral modification, while developing skills beyond “sit” and “stay”, giving your dog the needed self control, confidence and engagement to work off leash in every scenario and environment.

With more than 8,000 dogs trained and a sterling reputation built on results, Jennifer brings unmatched experience, discipline, and instinct to every session. Her method blends the best of global training techniques with a deep, intuitive understanding of canine behavior, helping owners build stronger, more responsive relationships with their dogs. This small, semi-private introductory session is designed to show you exactly what’s possible, so you can decide if you’re ready to advance to further training.

The Art of K9 Obedience Package includes:

  * One night’s accommodations in your choice of dog-friendly Historic or Contemporary rooms for one to two people and one (1) dog maximum per package

  * Building a reliable recall that works even with distractions
