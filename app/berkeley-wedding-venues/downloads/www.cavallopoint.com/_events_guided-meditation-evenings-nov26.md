# Guided Meditation Evenings with Tarika Lovegarden: Thankful Heart: Opening to Joy and Fulfillment

**Location** : Healing Arts Center & Spa  
**Time** : 6:30 – 7:30pm

Gratitude is one of the most powerful state-shifts we have. It turns the mind from scarcity to sufficiency, from “what’s missing” to “what’s here.”

In this guided meditation, you’ll practice:

  * Savoring the small, often overlooked blessings in your life.
  * Remembering moments of support, love, and inner strength.
  * Opening your heart to receive and appreciate more fully.



Tarika will share simple, science-informed gratitude practices you can weave into daily life. These practices can ease feelings of inadequacy, lift mood, and deepen your sense of connection with others.

As you strengthen a thankful heart, you’re more likely to feel fulfilled now—not only when circumstances change. This evening is a beautiful way to enter the holiday season grounded in joy, presence, and appreciation.
