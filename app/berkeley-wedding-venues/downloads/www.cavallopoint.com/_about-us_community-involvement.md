# Community Involvement

A Commitment to Our Land & Local Culture

Cavallo Point shares the commitment to the community and the environment demonstrated by Passports Resorts and its sister properties. The San Francisco Bay Area hotel management company is internationally known for developing and operating award-winning resorts that promote environmental and social responsibility, support sustainable development, and offer a luxurious and soulful guest experience

## Our Philosophy

Since its inception in 1998, Passport Resorts has embraced the philosophy that “what is good for our earth is also good for business.” Our commitment is to take as little from the environment as possible and to give back as much as we can. All Passport Resort properties share a reverence for the land, community, and local culture.  
To manifest this philosophy, we lead by example and pursue these strategies:

  * Create a responsible partnership with the local community
  * Inspire, educate and communicate with staff, community, guests, and others
  * Preserve and protect the environment
  * Respect others with whom we share the land, and preserve and impart their culture
  * Develop staff and the local economy, recognizing the impact of local employment
  * Provide opportunities for philanthropy (both guests and corporate donors)
  * Support other nonprofits with similar priorities



At Passport Resorts, we pursue what we call “holistic hospitality.” This means we engage with guests, staff, the community, and nature with intention, integrity, and respect. Today, as we see our long-held values regarding environmental stewardship and community support gain momentum around the world, Passport believes that luxury and sustainability are not mutually exclusive, but work ideally together.

## Organizations We Support

Since opening in July 2008, we have supported many community partnerships in the San Francisco Bay Area. Donations have included gift certificates, complimentary guest rooms or suites, restaurant meals and spa treatments, use of meeting facilities, event sponsorship, in-kind contributions, and other items of value. Among our Bay Area recipients are schools, environment programs, arts and cultural groups, local non-profit and civic organizations, museums, and others.

## The Cavallo Point Fund

The Cavallo Point Fund is a nonprofit entity that provides a simple mechanism for our hotel guests to give back to our community by making contributions that are distributed to local charitable organizations.

**How does the Cavallo Point Fund work?****  
** To implement this program, a discretionary charge of $3.00 per room night is added to the guest’s invoice. However, those who do not wish to participate may opt out without question at check-in or check-out.

**How are contributions to the Cavallo Point Fund used?****  
** 100% of all funds collected for the Cavallo Point Fund are used for charitable purposes and transmitted to tax-exempt charitable organizations that qualify under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue Code. Fund recipients are selected and amounts distributed at least quarterly.

As examples of the types of organizations supported by the Cavallo Point Fund, here are several organizations that have received Cavallo Point contributions previously:

  * **The Conscious Kitchen****  
** Administered through Teens Turning Green, this transformational school dining program at the Bayside Martin Luther King, Jr. Academy in Marin City nourishes children while educating students and families about healthy food choices, culinary basics, nutrition fundamentals, gardening practices, and overall health and wellness.

  * **The Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy****

  * **Bay Area Discovery Museum****  
** Located in Sausalito, the Bay Area Discovery Museum is designed to ignite creative thinking in children. The museum is a space for imaginations to run wild. Every curated detail of the exhibits brings creative thinking to life for all stages of childhood.

  * **The Marine Mammal Center****  
** The mission is to expand knowledge about marine mammals—their health and ocean environment—and to inspire their global conservation. Located in Sausalito, the Marine Mammal Center rescues and rehabilitates sick and injured marine mammals, supported by state-of-the-art animal care and research facilities, dedicated volunteers, and an engaged community.

**Are a guest’s contributions to the Cavallo Point Fund tax-deductible?****  
** Although all funds contributed to the Cavallo Point Fund will be distributed to charitable organizations that qualify under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, funds contributed to the Cavallo Point Fund are not eligible for a charitable tax-deduction. This is because the Cavallo Point Fund itself does not have a charitable tax exemption under either federal or state law.  
  
If you desire to make tax-deductible contributions, please consider discussing this further with your tax advisor or making contributions directly to any of the local charitable organizations that the Cavallo Point Fund supports.
