# K9 Training with Jennifer Sharpe

**Stay & Recall: Building Trust and Focus**

Two commands. Endless benefits. Join K9 Trainer Jennifer Sharpe for a practical, semi-private training session to strengthen communication and deepen the bond between you and your dog.

This hands-on class focuses on mastering two of the most essential obedience skills: the stay command and recall (come when called). Both skills are critical for your dog’s safety and confidence in everyday life.

What You’ll Learn:

  * How to introduce and reinforce the stay command with clarity and consistency
  * Building a reliable recall that works even with distractions
  * Starting in calm settings to build understanding before adding challenges
  * Applying these skills to real-world situations your dog will encounter



Each session with Jennifer Sharpe is designed to build upon your relationship, helping your dog develop the life skills and confidence needed to thrive in today’s busy world.

**Please note that the training session is available to guests participating in the The Art of K9 Obedience Package and all other hotel guests only.**
