# Guided Meditation Evenings with Tarika Lovegarden: Self-Compassion Meditation

**Location** : Healing Arts Center & Spa  
**Time** : 6:30 – 7:30pm

Most of us know how to be kind to others—and much harder on ourselves. This guided meditation helps you transform self-criticism, shame, and feelings of “not enough” into inner warmth, strength, and acceptance.

Tarika will guide you into the forgiving nature of your own heart, inviting you to meet your imperfections, mistakes, and tender spots with compassion rather than judgment. You’ll learn simple phrases and inner gestures you can use in real time when your inner critic flares.

As you practice self-compassion, you begin to see yourself more clearly and kindly. Confidence grows not from perfection, but from accepting all of who you are—quirks, edges, and gifts included. This shift supports nervous-system regulation, easing the grip of stress and making it easier to bounce back from challenges.

Over time, self-compassion becomes a new default: a kinder, more grounded way of being with yourself and with life.

Think of this evening as a mini-retreat: a time-out that helps you return to your life with more ease, clarity, and inner strength.
