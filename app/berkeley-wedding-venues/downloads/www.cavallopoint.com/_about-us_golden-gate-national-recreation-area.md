# Golden Gate National Recreation Area

A Wealth of Historic & Natural Treasures

Cavallo Point is stunningly situated in one of the largest and most popular urban national parks in the world: the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The parks’ 75,000+ acres contain 19 unique ecosystems in seven distinct watersheds, as well as many historical and cultural sites — including Alcatraz, Muir Woods National Monument, and the Presidio of San Francisco.

At the center sits Fort Baker, gateway to miles of coastal and inland trails and diverse recreational and cultural opportunities. Visitors to Fort Baker and Cavallo Point have access to neighboring organizations housed in the parks, including the National Park Service.

## National Park Service

The National Park Service cares for national parks — a network of nearly 400 natural, cultural, and recreational sites across the nation. The treasures in this system have been set aside by the American people to preserve, protect, and share the legacies of this land.

The Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the world.
