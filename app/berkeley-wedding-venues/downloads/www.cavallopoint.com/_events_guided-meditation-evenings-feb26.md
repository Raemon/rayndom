# Guided Meditation Evenings with Tarika Lovegarden: Loving-Kindness Meditation

**Location** : Healing Arts Center & Spa  
**Time** : 6:30 – 7:30pm

Experience the transformative power of loving-kindness, a heart-based meditation known as Metta. This timeless practice nurtures warmth, connection, and goodwill toward yourself, loved ones, those you find difficult, and all beings.

Guided by Tarika, you’ll be led through simple phrases and visualizations that help you soften self-judgment, dissolve lingering resentments, and open to a deeper sense of connection. As you learn to access the natural kindness of your heart, you may find that relationships feel more spacious, communication softens, and your inner world becomes more peaceful.

Loving-kindness supports nervous-system regulation by shifting you out of defensive states and into tenderness, safety, and care. With regular practice, it becomes easier to respond with compassion—both to yourself and others—even in challenging situations.

This evening is ideal for anyone longing for more warmth, forgiveness, and open-hearted connection in daily life.
