## Ceremony Rehearsal

Our catering team is happy to arrange a ceremony rehearsal for you and your wedding party at no additional fee. Rehearsal times are confirmed up to three weeks before your wedding, at a time that avoids other booked events. Ceremony rehearsals are normally one hour long.

## Rehearsal Dinner or Farewell Brunch

Cavallo Point is pleased to host your rehearsal dinner or farewell brunch. For pricing, venue, and menu options, please inquire at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2057454444494e475360434156414c4c4f504f494e540e434f4d).

## Wedding Menu Tasting

We offer sample menu tastings for weddings with a Food & Beverage minimum of $15,000. Tastings are by appointment Monday to Friday, 11:00 am – 3:00 pm. They should be held 4 to 8 weeks before the event, and are based on the seasonal availability of selected menus and your wedding date.

Tasting selections include two canapés, two starters, and two entrées, and are limited to four people (including the Wedding Coordinator).

For more information about our catering services and menus, please contact us directly.
