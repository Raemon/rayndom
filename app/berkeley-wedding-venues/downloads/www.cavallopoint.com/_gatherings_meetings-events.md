Gatherings Close To Everything, But Away From It All

Set at the foot of the majestic Golden Gate Bridge in historic Fort Baker, Cavallo Point is a natural gathering place for groups large and small. Each of our San Francisco meeting spaces offers a fresh approach to conferences, board retreats, and special events.

A place to break with convention, Cavallo Point is close to everything but away from it all. The destination is an inspired backdrop for your next memorable meeting or event.
