Chapel Steps to Bay Trail Hike

More of a stroll than a hike, you will be led under a grove of eucalyptus trees and to the retired Battery Yates along the coastline. This simple yet serene trek leads you up into the hills behind Ft. Baker and down into Horseshoe Cove, providing picturesque views of the military post, Golden Gate Bridge, and the Bay. Experience a piece of Marin’s natural beauty without the workout.  
  
**Distance** : 2 miles roundtrip  
**Difficulty** : Easy  
**Time** : Approximately 1 hour (roundtrip)  
**Price** : $200 for up to 6 people; above 6 people is $20 per person  





Battery Spencer Hike

Hike under the Golden Gate Bridge up to Battery Spencer overlooking the oceanside of the San Francisco Bay. Built in 1897 as part of the Harbor Defense of San Francisco, Battery Spencer was a concrete coastal gun battery for the U.S. Coastal Artillery. Now retired, this battery serves as a lookout point with some of the best views you can get of the Bridge and San Francisco.   
  
**Distance** : 3 miles  
**Difficulty** : Low moderate  
**Time** : Roughly 1.5 – 2 hours (roundtrip)  
**Price** : $300 for up to 6 people; above 6 people is $20 per person  





Kirby Cove

Kirby Cove nestles at the foot of the Marin Headlands just west of the Golden Gate Bridge. From Ft. Baker, the hike up Conzelman Road and down through a grove of cypress, eucalyptus, and pine to the beach takes a little over an hour. At the cove, find a pristine wedge of coarse-sand beach with a fabulous view of the Bridge and northern San Francisco.   
  
**Distance** : 4.5 miles roundtrip  
**Difficulty** : Low moderate  
**Time** : Approximately 2 – 2.5 hours (roundtrip)  
**Price** : $400 for up to 6 people; above 6 people is $20 per person
