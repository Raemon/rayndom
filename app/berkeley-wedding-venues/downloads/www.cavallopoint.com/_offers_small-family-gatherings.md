# Small Family Gatherings

### Create Lasting Family Memories 

Gather your loved ones for a memorable retreat at Cavallo Point. A natural haven for small family gatherings, Cavallo Point’s location at the foot of the majestic Golden Gate offers the ideal setting for graduations, reunions, multigenerational travel, and all other types of family events. Bring everyone closer together as your family solely occupies one of our charming Historic buildings. Each family group occupies its own spacious guestroom, allowing your entire family to share precious moments on the porch area, creating cherished memories amidst the stunning backdrop of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
