##### About Our Artist – Tracey Kessler

Tracey began her career path in art, architecture, and interior design in New York City and spent 25 years working on commercial, residential, and retail projects on both coasts. Despite being influenced by the tumultuous times of our modern era, her art has a calming, organic feel that echoes her California lifestyle. Drawing inspiration from renowned artists such as Sillman, Tapies, Frankenthaler, Mitchell, and Burri, Tracey’s artistry uses a diverse range of media, including oils, acrylics, watercolors, inks, charcoal, gesso, and natural pigments, giving her artworks a unique voice. She participates in group shows and has shown around the country in various galleries. Tracey enjoys teaching students of all ages, and her sidekick, “Oliver”, the Parson Poodle, is her friendly painting assistant.
