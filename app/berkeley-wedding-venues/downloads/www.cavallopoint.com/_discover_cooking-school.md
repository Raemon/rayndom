## About the Chef

Tim Grable is the Cooking School Director and Chef of the Cooking School at Cavallo Point. A California native, Chef Tim has cooked alongside some of the biggest names in San Francisco restaurants, in addition to teaching and being campus director at one of America’s most prestigious culinary academies

After graduating from the California Culinary Academy, Chef Tim went to work for award-winning chef/baker Fran Gage at her famous bakery Patisserie Francaise. Next, it was on to the iconic Blue Fox Restaurant, followed by a very successful three years at Stars Restaurant with Legendary Chef Jeremiah Tower, who is considered the father of California Cuisine.

Then, Chef Tim moved on to the Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group, where he worked at Kuleto’s Restaurant on Union Square and helped to hire and train chefs for the new properties around the country. During his time with Kimpton, Chef Tim also worked to open the Fifth Floor Restaurant with Chef George Morrone before moving on to the Lark Creek Restaurant group with Chef Bradley Ogden at One Market Restaurant.

After years in the kitchen, it was time to move into education, training a new generation of future chefs. Chef Tim went to work teaching at the California Culinary Academy/Le Cordon Bleu in San Francisco, where he spent 15 years moving from chef/instructor to executive chef, director of education and ultimately, campus director.

These days, Chef Tim is leading the Cooking School team through a vast array of cooking classes and amazing hands-on experiences in our unique and very special space.
