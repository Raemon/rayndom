# Cavallo Point Privacy Policy

 _Last Updated December 20, 2019_

At Cavallo Point Lodge (“Lodge”), the privacy and confidentiality of user information is important. We are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of your user information. We may update this policy from time to time, so please check here frequently.

Lodge is committed to safeguarding your privacy while visiting the Lodge website, namely, www.cavallopoint.com, (hereinafter all identified URLs are collectively referred to as the “Site”). Our goal is to provide you with an internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant to you. To achieve this goal, part of the operation of the Site includes the gathering of certain types of information about Site users. Because we understand that your privacy is important, we wish to explain the types of information we gather and the way in which we use it. This Privacy Policy applies to the Site. California residents will find additional information under our “California Privacy Notice.”

This Privacy Policy covers two types of information gathered at the Site, personal and aggregated. The term “personal information” refers to data you voluntarily provide in connection with use of the Site that identifies you and/or the company on whose behalf you are accessing and using the Site. Personal information includes, e.g., data submitted in connection with our services, such as your name, e-mail address, phone number, company affiliation, physical address, and/or certain other personal information. The term “aggregated data” refers to general information regarding visitors and users of the Site that relates to use of the Site, e.g., traffic patterns, number of visits to certain pages, visits from other websites or to third-party websites linked to the Site, use of particular services and interest in services, information or features of the Site or other parties made available through or found at the Site.

**What information is collected about you? How do we use it?**

We take the utmost care to ensure that the personal information we obtain from you is not used in a way that you may be unaware of or not agreeable to. You may wish to submit an information request about our Lodge, participate in one of our promotions or subscribe to our e-mail or postal mail lists. In response, we may ask for information such as your name and postal address. In the event you opt to provide us with this information, we will only use it for the purpose specified by you at the bottom of the information gathering form.

**Information collected on the Site may be used to:**

– Register you as a Lodge member  
– Plan and purchase Lodge accommodations  
– Enter your email in our promotions or sweepstakes  
– Send marketing communications or surveys to you  
– Respond to your questions or suggestions  
– Improve the quality of your visit to our site  
– All forms will provide an opt-out button to allow you to choose not to participate in Lodge lists and future online marketing. In deciding whether or not to join such lists, please note that they are only used for Lodge purposes or in joint promotions with a Lodge partner. You may request to be removed from our lists at any time. All emails distributed to our lists will contain easy, online access to unsubscribe.

**Permission for Use**  
Lodge may collect and use personal information that you submit at the Site in any manner that is consistent with uses stated in this Privacy Policy or disclosed elsewhere at the Site at the point you submit such personal information. By submitting personal information at the Site, you are giving your consent and permission for any use that is consistent with uses stated in this Privacy Policy or disclosed elsewhere at the Site at the point you submit such personal information, and such consent will be presumed by Lodge, unless you state otherwise at the time you submit the personal information. Please do not request any such communications on behalf of an individual or company if you are not authorized to make the request.

**Site Security**  
We want our website www.cavallopoint.com (hereinafter identified as the “Site”) visitors to feel confident about using our Site to plan and purchase their accommodations, so we are committed to protecting the information we collect. All personal information you provide is encrypted and secure.

**Secure Reservations**  
If you decide to make an online reservation at the Site, you will be linked to a reservation interface and a third-party booking engine (“Booking Engine”) provided by Sabre. While it appears to be part of our site, the Booking Engine is in fact provided by a third party and is governed by its privacy practices. We understand that security remains the primary concern of online consumers and have chosen the Booking Engine Vendor carefully.

*All information sent to this site, if in an SSL session, is encrypted, protecting against disclosure to third parties.

**Protecting Your Information**  
We would like our Site visitors to feel confident about using the Site to plan and purchase their accommodations, so Lodge is committed to protecting the information we collect. Lodge has implemented a security program to keep information that is stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access.

Our Site is hosted in a secure environment. The Site servers/systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling, technologies, and industry-standard firewalls. When you enter personal information during the reservation process, or during a customer email sign-up, your data is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure safe transmission.

**Withdrawing Consent to Use**  
If, after permitting use of your personal information, you later decide that you no longer want Lodge to include you on its mailing list or otherwise contact you or use your personal information in the manner disclosed in this Privacy Policy or at the Site, simply tell us by sending an e-mail, or by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” button at the bottom of our email communication to you.

**Use of Aggregated Data**  
Lodge is interested in improving the Site and may develop and offer new features and services. We monitor aggregated data regarding use of the Site for marketing purposes and to study, improve, and promote use of the Site. In connection with such purposes, Lodge may share aggregated data with third parties collectively and in an anonymous way. Disclosure of aggregated data does not reveal personal information about individual Site users in any way that identifies who they are or how to contact them.

**Exceptions to the Privacy Policy**  
Lodge has two exceptions to these limits on use of personal information:

Lodge may monitor and, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is required, disclose information to protect the security, property, assets, and/or rights of Lodge from unauthorized use, or misuse, of the Site or anything found at the Site.  
Lodge may disclose information when required by law; however, only to the extent necessary and in a manner that seeks to maintain the privacy of the individual.

**Use of Cookies**  
To enable features at the Site, Lodge may assign one or more “cookies” to your internet browser. Cookies, among other things, speed navigation through our Site, keep track of information so that you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site, and may provide you with customized content. A cookie is an internet mechanism composed of a small text file containing a unique identification number that permits a web server to send small pieces of information or text by means of your browser and place them on your computer’s hard drive for storage. This text lets the web server know if you have previously visited the web page. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user.

We use cookies to collect and maintain aggregated data (such as the number of visitors) to help us see which areas are most popular with our users and improve and update the content on our site. While in the process of browsing our site, you also provide us with information that doesn’t reveal your personal identity—what type of destination you’re exploring, for example. We use this aggregated data only as explained in this Privacy Policy. We do not connect aggregated data to any name, address, or other identifying information.

You may occasionally receive cookies from unaffiliated companies or organizations, to the extent they place advertising on our Site or are linked to the Site. These third-party cookies may collect information about you when you “click” on their advertising or content or link. This practice is standard in the internet industry. Because of the way in which the internet operates, we cannot control collection of this information by these third parties, and these cookies are not subject to this Privacy Policy.

**Children’s Privacy & Parental Consent**  
Please be aware that Lodge has not designed this Site for, and does not intend for it to be used by, anyone under age 18. Accordingly, this Site should not be used by anyone under age 18. Our privacy policy prohibits us from accepting users who are under the age of 18. Lodge specifically requests that persons under the age of 18 not use this Site or submit or post information to the Site. Should Lodge inadvertently acquire personal information or other data from users under the age of 18, Lodge will not knowingly provide this data to any third party for any purpose whatsoever, and any subsequent disclosure would be due to the fact the user under age 18 used the Site and submitted personal information without solicitation by or permission from Lodge.

**Links Provided to Other Sites**  
Lodge may provide links to a number of other websites that we believe might offer you useful information and services. However, those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as Lodge. Therefore, we are not responsible for the privacy policies or the actions of any third parties, including without limitation, any website owners whose sites may be reached through this Site, nor can we control the activities of those websites. We urge you to contact the relevant parties controlling these sites or accessing their on-line policies for the relevant information about their data collection practices before submitting any personal information or other sensitive data.

**Your Rights**  
Please be aware that your general rights under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are:

Right of access  
Right to rectification  
Right to erasure  
Right to restriction of processing  
Right to data portability  
Right to object  
You may exercise these rights by contacting [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). If you believe we are not complying with applicable data protection laws, it is your right to file a complaint with the applicable supervisory authority.

**Your Choices**  
You have the option to manage your personal information in the following ways:

**Information You Provide**

It is up to you to determine what personal information (if any) you wish to provide to us. Please note that should you choose not to provide us with certain details, some of your transactions may be impacted.

**Promotional Emails**

You may opt-out of receiving marketing emails from us by using the “unsubscribe” link included in all promotional emails that you receive from us. Alternatively, you may send an email to us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) stating your request to be removed. Please note that opting out of marketing and promotional emails may impact our ability to allow you access to certain offers, benefits and features. Please also note that opting-out of receiving marketing emails, may not apply to other communications that you may continue to receive from us. Examples include transactional emails such as reservation confirmation or customer service emails, notices of changes to our terms and conditions or this Privacy Policy, and email responses to your communications with us or requests for information that we receive from you. Requests to opt-out of receiving future marketing emails from us can take up to fifteen (15) business days to take effect.

**Updating Your Information**

You are welcome to correct or update certain pieces of personal information by contacting us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

The purposes for which the personal information was provided,  
An identifiable and ongoing business need, including record keeping,  
A specific legal or regulatory requirement, and/or  
A requirement to retain records that may be relevant to any notified regulatory investigations or active legal proceedings  
Your Consent to This Privacy Policy

Continued access and use of the Site without acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy relieves Lodge from responsibility to the user.

**Policy Modifications & Contacting Lodge**  
Lodge reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time; notice of changes will be published on this page. Changes will always be prospective, not retroactive. If you have questions about our policies, please contact us via email or by writing to us at the address below.
