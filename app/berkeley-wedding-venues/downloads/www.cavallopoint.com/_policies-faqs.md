Can you please clarify the Food and Beverage minimum?

The Food & Beverage minimum is the least amount of money that you are required to spend—combining food and beverage, excluding taxable service charge, facility fees, labor fees, and tax. The Food & Beverage minimum is dependent on the venue and date you select.

Please keep in mind that you may spend more than the Food & Beverage minimum for wedding celebrations. The minimum is reached by selecting a combination of menu packages to equal or exceed the required dollar figure depending on your anticipated guest attendance. The following are examples of items that would apply towards the food and beverage minimum:

  * Butler-passed and/or displayed hors d’oeuvres, plated or buffet meals, children’s meals, dessert stations, beverage service, dinner wine, champagne toast, and non-alcoholic beverage offerings.



Specialty lighting and décor, labor fees, bartender and/or chef fees, parking, guestroom accommodations, and in-room dining do not count towards the food and beverage minimum.
