# Guided Meditation Evenings with Tarika Lovegarden: Clear Mind Meditation: Find Clarity and Calm

**Location** : Healing Arts Center & Spa  
**Time** : 6:30 – 7:30pm

In a world of constant noise, a clear mind is a superpower. This guided meditation helps you release looping thoughts, mental clutter, and decision fatigue so you can think—and feel—more clearly.

With Tarika’s guidance, you’ll:

  * Gently untangle from overthinking and mental “what-ifs”
  * Learn simple ways to direct your attention where it truly matters
  * Cultivate a steadier inner space for wise choices and creative insight



By supporting a calmer nervous system, Clear Mind meditation makes it easier to respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively. Over time, this practice can improve sleep, sharpen focus, and brighten your overall outlook.

Give yourself an hour to step out of the noise and reconnect with your own clarity and inner calm.
