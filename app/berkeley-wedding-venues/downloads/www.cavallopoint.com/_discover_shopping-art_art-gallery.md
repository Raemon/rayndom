##### The Photography of Jerry Dodrill

Jerry Dodrill is an adventurer, naturalist and award-winning photographer who has traveled to remote corners of the Earth in a lifelong quest for wild experiences. His immense talent and creative eye have been well recognized through international awards and exhibition in fine galleries, such as the Ansel Adams in Yosemite, Mountain Light, Mumm Napa Valley, and the Banff Center for Mountain Culture. As a teacher, workshop facilitator and expedition leader for Visionary Wild, Ansel Adams Gallery, and the former Mountain Light Gallery, he has proven himself as a highly engaging and effective photographic educator. Regular expeditions include sailing in Northeast Greenland, overlanding in Kyrgyzstan, and rafting the Grand Canyon.

An expert mountain climber with degrees in Fine Art and Photography, Jerry is passionate about preservation and was a protégé of legendary Galen Rowell in the late 1990’s. Today he resides in the Sonoma Coast village of Bodega, California, where in addition to focusing on assignment photography, writing, exhibitions, and sharing his vision and expertise with others, he operates Dodrill Gallery which exclusively features his fine art prints.

Jerry’s work has been featured in many ad campaigns, books, and publications. He is a regular contributor to Sonoma Magazine, a writer and senior contributor to California Climber Magazine, has performed assignments for and/or been published by The North Face, Sierra Magazine, Orion, Vanity Fair, World of Fine Wine, Wine Spectator, Men’s Journal, National Geographic Adventure, Smithsonian, Outside, Alpinist, Rock & Ice, Climbing, Mountain and many, many others. He was fundamental in product development and creation of the exciting backpack company MindShift Gear, serves as Vice President of the Rock Ice & Mountain Club and sits on the board of directors of the B-Rad Foundation. He is dedicated to helping protect our planet and works with conservation organizations including The Nature Conservancy, Sonoma Land Trust, the Laguna de Santa Rosa Foundation, and the Access Fund.
