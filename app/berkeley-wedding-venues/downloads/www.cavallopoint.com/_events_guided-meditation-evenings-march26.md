# Guided Meditation Evenings with Tarika Lovegarden: From Busy Mind to Restful Sleep Meditation

**Location** : Healing Arts Center & Spa  
**Time** : 6:30 – 7:30pm

If your mind races at night or you struggle to “switch off” after a full day, this evening is for you. In this guided meditation, you’ll learn how to move from mental overdrive into a calm, sleep-supportive state.

Tarika will guide you through practices that quiet mental chatter, soften emotional tension, and invite your body into deep rest. You’ll explore gentle breathing, body mindfulness, and soothing imagery to help your nervous system shift from high alert to relaxation.

Research shows that meditation can support better sleep, reduce stress, and improve emotional resilience. This session focuses on practical tools you can use before bed—or anytime you need to downshift from a busy mind into ease.

Come unwind, reset, and experience how meditation can become a powerful ally for more peaceful nights and more refreshed days.

This evening is ideal for anyone longing for more warmth, forgiveness, and open-hearted connection in daily life.
