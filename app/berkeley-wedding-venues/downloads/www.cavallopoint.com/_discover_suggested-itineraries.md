Plan for Perfect Days at Cavallo Point

With so many things to do, sometimes it’s hard to know where to start. To assist in planning your visit, we’ve put together some itineraries for both adults and families. Cavallo Point’s back yard is 80,000 acres of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, with built-in fun like hiking and beachcombing. On-site activities include watercolor classes and yoga, while San Francisco and Wine Country attractions are just a short drive away.   
  
Tickets and information for activities and excursions are available online through the links in each itinerary. Our Les Clefs d’Or Concierge Maryanne Wong is also pleased to help you plan or book dining, tours, outdoor activities, and more.
