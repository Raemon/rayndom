### Stress-less Meditation

Reduce Anxiety, Become Centered

Life can be stressful at times and affects us in multiple ways. Mental stress can make you feel anxious, frazzled, and overwhelmed. When manifested physically, stress can cause tension, chronic pain, and disrupt sleep. This guided meditation teaches you how to take “time out” from the chaos of your busy mind, ease feelings of anxiety, and become centered so that you can focus on what you need to accomplish.

### Generosity Meditation

Expand Every Aspect of Your Life

Don’t lose a precious opportunity to show gratitude! Discover the power of generosity and how it can bring you into the moment and expand every aspect of your life. It feels good to be generous, help others, and creatively contribute to your work, family, and the world around you. You become more receptive to the main blessings being showered on you, day in and day out. Generosity meditation opens your heart and gives you a direct experience of your deeper nature and the many beautiful qualities within you.

Create Lasting Changes for Your Well-Being

### The Body Code

The Body Code is an energy healing experience that identifies imbalances of all types; emotional, physical, pathogens, toxins, nutritional, thought patterns and more. Our practitioner uses muscle testing to identify and confirm releases of these energies. After releasing these energies, one may experience ease in the body systems, flow, clarity and overall restoration of energy and health. She also incorporates a unique blend of intuitive energy healing, sacred geometry and sound healing into her sessions, making for a unique experience for each individual.

This is a clothes on experience (comfy clothing or robes are perfect).

60 minutes$260
