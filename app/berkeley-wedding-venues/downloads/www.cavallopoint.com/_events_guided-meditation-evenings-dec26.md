# Guided Meditation Evenings with Tarika Lovegarden: Past Behind, Peace Ahead: Letting Go and Moving On Meditation

**Location** : Healing Arts Center & Spa  
**Time** : 6:30 – 7:30pm

As the year comes to a close, this meditation offers a gentle yet powerful invitation: loosen your grip on the past so you can step into the future with more peace.

Guided by Tarika, you’ll:

  * Bring awareness to old stories, resentments, or disappointments that still weigh on you.
  * Practice ancient mindfulness techniques for softening attachment and letting go.
  * Connect with the calm, wise presence beneath the drama of the past.



Letting go doesn’t mean forgetting or approving of what happened. It means releasing the chronic tension and mental replay that keep you bound to it. This supports your nervous system in moving from guardedness to openness, from contraction to spaciousness.

Join us to put the past in its rightful place, reclaim your energy, and end 2026 feeling lighter, clearer, and more available to what’s next.
