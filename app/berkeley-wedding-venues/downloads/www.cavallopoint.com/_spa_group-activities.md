### Yoga

Private Group Class rates start at $300/hour for a group of 6; for larger groups, add $25 per person

Yoga is a physical and mental discipline that helps achieve balance by connecting the body, breath and mind. A typical yoga routine combines physical postures, called asanas, with breathing techniques and meditative practices. Goals often include stress reduction and physical fitness. Classes are led by experienced and accredited yoga instructors. Each class is one hour long; mats and props (as needed) are provided. Classes are suited to all students unless otherwise noted.

*Subject to rental and labor fees, based on location and group size

### Play

Adults are grown-up kids, so recess is essential. Cavallo Point, the ideal playground for groups, offers acres of open space for lawn bowling (bocce ball), cornhole, croquet and more.

Hikes

## Hikes

We offer private hikes for our guests and we can customize routes for a group. The following are six recommended hikes that begin and end here at Cavallo Point.

* * *

### Chapel Steps to Bay Trail Hike

More of a stroll than a hike, you will be led under a grove of eucalyptus trees and to the retired Battery Yates along the coastline. This simple yet serene trek leads you up into the hills behind Ft. Baker and down into Horseshoe Cove, providing picturesque views of the military post, Golden Gate Bridge, and the Bay. Experience a piece of Marin’s natural beauty without the workout

**Distance** : 2 miles roundtrip  
**Difficulty** : Easy  
**Time** : Approximately 1 hour (roundtrip)  
**Price** : $200 for up to 6 people; above 6 people is $20 per person

### Battery Spencer Hike

Hike under the Golden Gate Bridge up to Battery Spencer overlooking the ocean side of the San Francisco Bay. Built in 1897 as part of the Harbor Defense of San Francisco, Battery Spencer was a concrete coastal gun battery for the U.S. Coastal Artillery. Now retired, this battery serves as a lookout point with some of the best views you can get of the Bridge and San Francisco.

**Distance** : 3 miles  
**Difficulty** : Low moderate  
**Time** : Roughly 1.5 – 2 hours (roundtrip)  
**Price** : $300 for up to 6 people; above 6 people is $20 per person

### Kirby Cove Hike

Kirby Cove nestles at the foot of the Marin Headlands just west of the Golden Gate Bridge. From Ft. Baker, the hike up Conzelman Road and down through a grove of cypress, eucalyptus, and pine to the beach takes a little over an hour. At the cove, find a pristine wedge of coarse-sand beach with a fabulous view of the Bridge and northern San Francisco.

**Distance** : 4.5 miles roundtrip  
**Difficulty** : Low moderate  
**Time** : Approximately 2 – 2.5 hours (roundtrip)  
**Price** : $400 for up to 6 people; above 6 people is $20 per person

## Featured Hikes

History Walks

Cavallo Point is located at Fort Baker, which is registered as a National Historic District. Learn the history of Fort Baker and follow the site’s evolution — from its first inhabitants, the Miwoks, and the role as a key U.S. army base (established in 1897), to the transition to the National Park Service (2002) and creation of today’s Cavallo Point Lodge (opened in 2008).

Wellness Hikes

A hike with Dr. Brad Jacobs, Cavallo Point’s resident integrative medicine doctor, is part wellness consultation, part mindfulness training, and part adventure. Choose from a range of hikes and get your group on the right foot towards stress reduction, improved health, and the joy of exercise at home and work.

Boot Camps

## Boot Camps

Build strength and camaraderie among your team with a group outdoor fitness boot camp session. Workouts can be scaled to suit all fitness levels, from fresh-faced beginner to ultra-fit.  
  
Engage in high-intensity interval training, incorporating fundamental and functional movements including lunges, squats, obstacle courses, battle and jump ropes, kettlebells, medicine balls, TRX, and other activities. The workout is designed to challenge all of your muscle groups, as well as your cardiovascular fitness.  
  
Your trainer will assess the health and fitness levels of your team in terms of flexibility, cardiovascular endurance and muscular strength, with the goal of identifying personalized, achievable, and sustainable milestones to optimize your health and fitness. Groups of 24 or more require multiple classes at separate days/times.

  
**Group of up to 12** : $600  
**Group of 13-24** : $1,100

### Interactive Health Lectures & Workshops

Doctor Brad Jacobs

Cavallo Point’s resident physician, Brad Jacobs MD, MPH, is a doctor of internal medicine who graduated from Stanford University. He is also trained in acupuncture, functional medicine, herbal medicine, nutrition, yoga, and martial arts.

### Hypnotherapy Workshop

Shirley Davalos, Hypnotherapist/Media Consultant

Hypnotherapy can play a major role in supporting optimum health. A reliable method to quiet the mind and reduce constant “brain chatter”, it creates a tranquil space where new perspectives can be recognized and developed. Group members learn how to use the tremendous power of imagination to be the architect of their lives and uncover answers that have long been buried in the subconscious.

### Group Destiny Retrieval

Molly Maguire, Shaman

Achieve the deepest levels of group synergy, visioning, and momentum with the powerful techniques of modern shamanism. Resident Shaman Molly Maguire facilitates a collaborative process unlike anything found in traditional group experiences. Participants journey into the realm of possibilities and bring back tools to expand and broaden creative potential, both personal and professional. Groups leave connected in an inspired way, with resilience and tools to step into a future of possibility.
