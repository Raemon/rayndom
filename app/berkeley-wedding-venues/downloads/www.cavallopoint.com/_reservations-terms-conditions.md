## Reservation Terms & Conditions; Taxes & Fees

### 

### Reservations and Deposits

A credit card is required at the time of confirmation to guarantee your Hotel reservation.

One night’s deposit is required at the time of reservation to guarantee a hotel room. Hotel check-in is after 4:00 pm and check-out is 12:00 pm.

Room rates are based on Double Occupancy. Additional adult occupants (up to 4 occupants total per room) are charged at $25 per person/per night. Children 17 years and under are complimentary. We are a pet-friendly hotel with availability for specific rooms, and dogs of all sizes are welcome. Please note that there is a $150 one-time pet fee per pet/per room for canine companions.

### Cancellations

One night’s deposit is required to guarantee a hotel room. Please cancel 72 hours prior to arrival date to avoid a one night’s room charge. Reservations made at least 72 hours before the check-in date will not incur cancellation charges if cancellation is done within 24 hours after the initial booking. Changes to reservations made through a third-party channel such as a Travel Advisor, Expedia or Booking.com, must be made directly through that advisor/channel. Excludes any Group Reservations and Advanced Purchase and/or pre-paid reservations.

**National Park Service Fee & Property/Safety Services Fee**  
Since Cavallo Point Lodge is located on federal land within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, it is exempt from the imposition of local hotel occupancy tax. The local occupancy tax typically would be 14% of the room rate. Instead of collecting a local hotel occupancy tax, Cavallo Point Lodge collects **two separate fees totaling 14% of the room rate** in the aggregate.

**National Park Service Fee**  
The first fee that Cavallo Point Lodge collects is a **National Park Service Fee equal to 10%** **of the room rate,** which assists the NPS in its costs associated with providing utilities, transportation services, park services support, and program support costs related to the property’s location in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.

**Property/Safety Services Fee**  
Cavallo Point Lodge collects a **Property/Safety Services Fee equal to 4% of the room rate** , which is used by Cavallo Point Lodge to pay a Service District Charge to the National Park Service. This Service District Charge is related to the National Park Service providing emergency and long-term public services to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area such as fire, police, ambulance, and other property and safety services.

**California Tourism Assessment**  
The California Tourism Assessment is **equal to .03% of the room rate** and is paid directly to State of California for management and administrative services related to statewide tourism for all California accommodations.

**Cavallo Point Fund (_optional_)**  
The Cavallo Point Fund is a simple mechanism for our hotel guests to give back to our community by making contributions that are distributed to local charitable organizations. A **discretionary charge of $3.00 per night** is added to the guest’s invoice. However, those who do not wish to participate may opt-out without questions at check-in or check-out.

Note: 100% of all funds collected for the Cavallo Point Fund are used for charitable purposes and transmitted to tax-exempt charitable organizations that qualify under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Fund recipients are selected and amounts are distributed at least quarterly.
