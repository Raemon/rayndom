## Tea Time

The storied tradition of afternoon tea is said to have begun in 1840 in England when the seventh Duchess of Bedford found herself peckish around 4pm. Dinner was served fashionably late at 8pm, so she began to order tea with bread, butter and cake to her room. Soon enough, she began to invite her friends to enjoy it with her. Please join us for a beautifully curated experience as a delightful afternoon treat between meetings or a memorable addition to a getaway with friends or wedding party.
