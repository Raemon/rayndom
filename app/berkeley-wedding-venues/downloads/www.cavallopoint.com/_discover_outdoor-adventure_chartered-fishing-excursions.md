# Chartered Fishing Excursions

## Set Sail for an Awesome Adventure

Enjoy a day of fishing, both inside and outside the Golden Gate, with our weekly chartered fishing excursions. The captain and crew are here to ensure a safe, fun, and memorable adventure — using their expert knowledge of the water and fishing guidance to help ensure an exceptionally high catch rate. 

Private excursions are also available. Please inquire for pricing.

## Outer Limits

This 55-foot catamaran provides a fast and stable fishing experience, with a hull providing maximum stability and a smooth, easy ride. The ample deck space and heated cabin create an excellent platform on which to spend the day on the water. Fishing excursions launch from the Clipper/Charter Boat Pier in Sausalito, only a 10-15 minute drive from Cavallo Point. Rods and weights are included in the cost.

  * Halibut/Bass (April to September): $295/person
  * Tuna (early October): $690/person
  * Rockfish Lingcod (October): $320/person
  * Crab & Rockfish Combo (November to December): $325/person



## Chasin’ Crustacean

The Chasin’ Crustacean spans 36’ in length and 14’ in width, making it one of the largest six-person charter boats in the Bay Area. The vessel is extremely fast and stable with ample deck space, and the spacious cabin and wheelhouse feature state-of-the-art fishing technology and a comfortable bathroom. Fishing excursions launch at the Fort Baker Boat Harbor located right next door to Cavallo Point. Rods and weights are included in the cost.

  * Halibut/Bass (April to September): $330/person
