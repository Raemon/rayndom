# Six Quirky Marin ThingsTo Do

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Friday, July 19, 2024 by MCVB Staff

Have you ever visited a new country, or even a new city, and just felt instantly connected? Like you were a part of something bigger than yourself? We don’t know what it is, but some places just simply feel different.

Marin County is such a place. Special—not because you can go hang gliding or kayaking among the kelp; not because you can find fresh, sustainable agriculture; not because you can experience the pinnacle of luxury and the world's finest wines; or even because you can do all of these things in one location. What makes Marin special is the sense of purpose that courses through the land, the people, and the everyday practices that define this unique corner of California.

## Be _just a little out there..._

Geographically, philosophically, and by almost any measure imaginable, Marin County is “just a little out there…” With that in mind, let’s talk about the unique and quirky things you can do the next time you visit Marin:

### 

###   
**Take a Power Yoga SUP Class in San Rafael**

What’s a SUP, you might ask? Well, it’s a stand-up paddleboard. That’s right, we’re talking yoga on the water in San Rafael.

Imagine striking a perfect Warrior pose, your body and mind harmoniously engaged, while gently bobbing on the serene waters of Marin. Hosted by [101 Surf Sports](https://www.visitmarin.org/outdoor-activities/kayaking/101-surf-sports-1-1/), this unique blend of yoga and paddleboarding takes your workout to a whole new level. The gentle sway of water adds an extra challenge to your balance, engaging your core and aligning your joints in a way you couldn’t achieve on land.

For just $35, you can join a 90-minute session every Saturday at noon. Whether you’re a seasoned yogi or a beginner, the experienced instructors will guide you through this unique experience—and don’t forget to come with an open mind and a sense of playfulness.

### 

### **Satiate Your Hunger for Technical Bike Trails**

Back in the 1960s, Marin became the birthplace of mountain biking when a group of teenagers known as the Larkspur Canyon Gang took old balloon tire bicycles and refurbished them to go off riding. To learn more about the history of cycling in Marin, don’t forget to check out the [mountain biking museum](https://www.visitmarin.org/outdoor-activities/mountain-biking-and-road-cycling/marin-museum-of-bicycling-mountain-bike-hall-of-fame-1/) in Fairfax.

Once you’re done at the museum, you can start your next adventure by checking out the Marin Council and Boy Scouts of America-operated [Camp Tamarancho’s trails](https://www.visitmarin.org/outdoor-activities/mountain-biking-and-road-cycling/camp-tamarancho/). With 480 acres of pristine forest and technical single-track trails, this place is a mountain biker's dream. Whether you're a newbie or an expert, you'll find trails that challenge and thrill, offering stunning views of the surrounding hills. And with a constantly expanding trail system, there's always a new path to discover. [VisitMari](https://www.visitmarin.org/blog/biking-in-marin-collection/)n has a whole collection of bike riding information visitors can follow up with.

### **Indulge Your Imagination at Imagination Park**

Marin is the home of holistic arts, goat cheese artisans, and the natural habitat of those grateful for nature and the Grateful Dead. It’s also the birthplace of mountain biking and Obi-Wan Kenobi—not on planet Stewjon, but in San Anselmo, California, where George Lucas has lived since the early 1970s.

[Imagination Park](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/landmarks/imagination-park/) in downtown San Anselmo, financed by Lucas, features life-sized statues of Yoda and Indiana Jones. This small park, a hub for local events like the annual Christmas Tree lighting, is always buzzing with children's games and is a popular Pokémon Go spot. It’s a charming reminder of the town's influence on Lucas' creative legacy.

### 

### **Try a Fire and Ice Treatment at 9 Corners**

Ready to feel like a rock star? Try [9 Corners' Fire and Ice treatment](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/9-corners-med-cryo-spa-at-vintage-oaks-novato/)! Start with 3 minutes in their cryogenically cooled vapor chamber, more effective than cold plunging, to boost your mood and energy while burning 500–800 calories. Finish with a 30-minute full-spectrum infrared sauna, where deep-penetrating light alleviates pain, detoxifies at the cellular level, and improves circulation. Together, these two**[spa treatments](https://www.9corners.com/fire-ice)** will unleash a total transformation. Also, don't miss the Cryo Happy Hour each Thursday from 3:00 to 6:00 pm!

### **Buzz by to Sip Sweet Honey Mead**

Ever wondered what it’s like to be a Viking? Whether or not you answered "yes," we recommend visiting [Heidrun Meadery](https://www.visitmarin.org/green-travel-marin/agri-tourism-farm-to-fork-experiences/heidrun-meadery/), where honey’s journey from flowers to glass is an art form. Each mead captures the botanical essence of its source, with flavors as diverse as the flowers they come from.

Founded by geologist-turned-brewer [Gordon Hull](https://www.visitmarin.org/culinary/the-farmer-the-market/meadmakers-at-heidrun-meadery/), Heidrun produces sparkling meads from both monofloral and wildflower honey, many from their own hives in Northern California. Now located in Point Reyes Station, they also maintain a commercial beekeeping operation and cultivate bee-friendly crops. Raise a glass and savor the unique flavors of Heidrun Mead.

### **Walk the Earthquake Trail**

Are you ready for some history? Step onto the [Earthquake Trail at Point Reyes](https://www.visitmarin.org/outdoor-activities/national-parks-in-marin-county/bear-valley-visitors-center/), where you’ll literally walk between two infamous tectonic plates. This trail is more than a path—it’s a seismic runway showcasing the sheer power of the Earth’s forces when a cow barn split in two, and the Point Reyes land mass was shoved 16 feet northwest during the 1906 earthquake!

As you stroll, interpretive signs narrate the tales of geology and time. Look out for the 16-foot fence displacement—a monument to nature’s brute strength. And don’t forget to stop by the “cow caught in…” story panel for a chuckle-worthy bit of local lore. With its paved, accessible trail, the Earthquake Trail offers both a science lesson and a whimsical journey through meadows and woodlands.

Marin isn't as far away as it feels. It's just a little out there. To wanderers and seekers amidst a bustling world, Marin County stands as a sanctuary of natural beauty, cultural richness, and unconventional adventures.
