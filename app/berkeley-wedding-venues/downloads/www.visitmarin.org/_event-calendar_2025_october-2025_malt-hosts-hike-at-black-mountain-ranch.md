# MALT Hosts Hike at Black Mountain Ranch

**Date** : Friday, October 17, 2025

**Time** : 10:00am - 2:00pm

[**Website**](https://malt.org/malt_events/oct-17-2025-hike-at-black-mountain-ranch/?utm_source=Marin+Agricultural+Land+Trust&utm_campaign=e230f000a3-EVENT_2025_FALL_HIKES&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_-d6716a3bc0-3960)

Join us for a hike at Black Mountain Ranch. Black Mountain is one of the most recognizable landmarks in West Marin, rising above the town of Point Reyes Station. MALT-protected since 1993, Black Mountain Ranch is a model for agricultural diversification with a variety of operations including a vegetable farmer, cattle ranchers, and fiber producers who are dedicated to protecting the natural resources that allow their operations to thrive. 

This challenging six-mile round trip hike, to the top of Black Mountain and back, is not for the faint of heart. It can be steep, windy, hot, or raining, but beauty is around every turn. Hike to the top, hike partway and settle in for a picnic and stunning views, or join us simply to learn more about Point Reyes Lavender Co.’s operations. You’ll get to take home an amazing lavender sachet while the product is available. Space is limited, we hope to see you there!

This is a free event, although a $25.00 donation is recommended. Registration is required in the above website link.
