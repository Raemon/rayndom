# The Best Wedding Venues in Marin

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Thursday, February 15, 2024 by MCVB Staff

By Megan Eileen McDonough

Did your special someone pop the very important question this Valentine's Day? Whether you’re newly engaged or considering a destination [wedding](https://www.visitmarin.org/meetings-events/weddings/) someplace warm, here are five of Marin County’s best indoor and outdoor venues.

**Acqua Hotel, Mill Valley**

If you want a wedding fit for a princess, look no further than the [Acqua Hotel ](https://www.visitmarin.org/hotels/boutique/acqua-hotel/)in Mill Valley. Outdoor weddings here are idyllic year-round, with views of Mount Tamalpais and Richardson Bay serving as a backdrop worthy of any fairy tale. The property accommodates both small and midsize weddings, anywhere from 40 to 120 guests.

On the big day, the bride is the star of the show, making her grand entrance by gliding down an outdoor spiral staircase that leads to the bayside terrace. Then guests move into the elegant Richardson Room for the reception. Featuring floor-to-ceiling windows that open to a bayside terrace, there’s no better view for a Champagne toast.

**The Haven at Tomales**

Escape to a very private location surrounded by nature where your guests will refresh their outlook on this beautiful thing called life. As a family-owned and operated private ranch, home to Purebred Angus cattle and a flock of sheep, this private farm is exclusively yours for your special day. A self-guided farm tour is made available to all guests during your wedding throughout the Terraced Garden, Covered Patio, and Historic Barn. [The Haven at Tomales](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/agriculture-aquaculture-and-protected-farmland/the-haven-at-tomales-1/) encourages all visitors to enjoy learning about local agriculture and its local production.

Choose from several outdoor ceremony locations for your wedding or elopement ceremony and find the scenic location that speaks best to you. Whether it is intimate and woodsy, or adventurous overlooking rolling hills, The Haven as a historic location is truly the Bay Area's hidden treasure event venue. 

**Panama Hotel**

Couples come from far and wide to host their rehearsal dinners and wedding receptions at the [Panama Hotel](https://www.visitmarin.org/hotels/bed-breakfast/the-panama-hotel-and-restaurant/)’s historic dining room, complete with tropical garden patios that make you feel like you’re in a world all your own. As for the atmosphere, the Panama is as sophisticated as a small European inn yet decidedly Northern Californian, too.

The Panama events team works with each couple to make sure every detail is in order, from seating and floral arrangements to musical entertainment. Located in the Gerstle Park neighborhood of [San Rafael](https://www.visitmarin.org/places/san-rafael/), it’s easy to turn this mini-getaway into a cultural retreat.

**Falkirk Cultural Center**

For a somewhat less traditional wedding venue, consider the [Falkirk Cultural Center](https://www.livelifelocally.org/falkirk-rentals/) in San Rafael. The estate spans 11 acres, including wooded hillsides, a ceremonial rose garden, a private wedding lawn, and a verandah for outdoor dining and wedding receptions. The estate accommodates weddings parties of up to 125 guests.

Wedding parties also have full use of the entire first floor, including the foyer and a secluded wooden porch on the verandah. The main attraction is definitely the 1888 Queen Anne Victorian. With large, sun-filled rooms, coffered ceilings, wood paneling, decorative fireplaces and floor-to-ceiling stained-glass windows, no detail will go unnoticed on your special day.
