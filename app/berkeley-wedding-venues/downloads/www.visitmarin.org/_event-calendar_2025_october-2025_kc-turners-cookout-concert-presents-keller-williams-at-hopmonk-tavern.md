# KC Turner's Cookout Concert Presents Keller Williams at HopMonk Tavern

**Date** : Sunday, October 12, 2025

**Time** : Doors Open at 4:00pm and Show Starts at 6:00pm

[**Website**](https://wl.eventim.us/event/keller-williams/645467?afflky=HopMonkNovato)

Virginian, Keller Williams, released his first album in 1994, FREEK, and has since given each of his albums a single syllable title: BUZZ, SPUN, BREATHE, LOOP, LAUGH, HOME, DANCE, STAGE, GRASS, DREAM, TWELVE, LIVE, ODD, THIEF, KIDS, BASS, PICK, FUNK, VAPE, SYNC, RAW, SANS, ADD, SPEED, CELL, GRIT, DROLL and DEER. Each title serves as a concise summation of the concept guiding each project.  
  
Keller's albums reflect his pursuit to create music that sounds like nothing else. Un-beholden to conventionalism, he seamlessly crosses genre boundaries. The end product is music that encompasses rock, jazz, funk and bluegrass, and always keeps the audience on their feet. Keller built his reputation initially on his engaging live performances, no two of which are ever alike. For most of his career he has performed solo. His stage shows are rooted around Keller singing his compositions and choice cover songs, while accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, bass, guitar synthesizer and drum samples; a technique called live phrase sampling or "looping." The end result often leans toward a hybrid of alternative folk and groovy electronica, a genre Keller jokingly calls "acoustic dance music" or ADM."  
  
Keller's constant evolution has led to numerous band projects as well; Keller & The Keels, Grateful Grass, KWahtro, Keller and the Travelin' McCourys, Grateful Gospel and More Than A Little to name a few. Keller can be found playing clubs and festivals around the U.S. with these projects throughout the year.

General Admission Tickets are $40.93 per person. General Admission plus Cookout Meal is $65.80 per person. All tickets can be purchased in the above website link.
