## Experience Frank Lloyd Wright's Marin Center

When we do open again, join us for a private docent-led behind-the-scenes tour of the Marin County Civic Center designed by renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The Marin County Civic Center (1957) is one of the last major works of Wright’s career and his only realized project for a government entity.

During this 90-minute walking tour, you’ll get access to the Marin County Board of Supervisors Chambers and their private balcony, you’ll be eye level with the building’s iconic blue roof, you’ll see custom furniture designed Frank Lloyd Wright and built by inmates from San Quentin’s woodshop, and you’ll learn the complicated and scandalous history of the creation of the building from specially trained docents.

Widely considered to be the greatest American architect of the 20th century, Wright’s innovative design of the Marin County Civic Center dramatically illustrates the kinship of architecture to the surrounding landscape with long horizontal buildings that gracefully link the crowns of three separate hills.

Docent-led tours are offered every Wednesday (starting June 1, 2025) at 1pm and every Friday at 10:30 a.m. You need to [buy tickets](https://www.marincounty.gov/departments/cultural-services/frank-lloyd-wright/frank-lloyd-wright-tours/buy-tickets-frank-lloyd-wright-tour) in advance. Meet in the Civic Center Cafeteria (Room 233). [Pre-purchased tickets](https://www.marincounty.org/depts/cu/tours) are highly recommended.

Guests should be prepared to walk/stand for 90 minutes. The tour covers approximately one mile in total distance.
