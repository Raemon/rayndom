# Outdoor Events to Enjoy This Summer in Marin County

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Thursday, May 22, 2025 by MCVB Staff

By Whitney Butler

Summer in Marin County is the best time to enjoy the outdoors. Savor farm-fresh produce at [local farmers’ markets](http://www.visitmarin.org/blog/farmers-markets-in-marin/), hike a sunny trail atop Mount Tamalpais, or stroll along the coast on one of [Marin’s beautiful beaches](http://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/beaches-in-marin-county/).

In Marin, it’s easy to combine long summer days and balmy evenings with entertainment and culture. Here are a few inspired ideas to add to your summer activity checklist.

**Concert Series at Town Center Corte Madera**

In addition to a weekly farmers’ market, [Town Center Corte Madera](https://www.shoptowncenter.com/events-news/) hosts an annual music series from June to August showcasing all kind of styles surrounded by a beautiful village-style shopping mall. Every Sunday from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., live music fills the Town Center as you shop popular brands like Ethan Allen and Urban Outfitters, and lesser-known, local favorites, too.

Enjoy food from several vendors inside the mall, and don’t forget a folding chair and blanket to enjoy live jams from local artists.

**Live on the Avenue in San Anselmo**

We will see you in 2024! The Town of San Anselmo and the [San Anselmo Chamber of Commerce](https://www.visitsananselmo.com/chamber-calendar/#!event-list) are pleased to announce that [San Anselmo Live On The](https://www.liveontheavenue.org/) [Avenue](https://www.liveontheavenue.org/) will be back this summer June through September. This series is where live entertainment coincides with a pedestrian thoroughfare straight through the heart of town. Come stroll, shop, dine, and dance on San Anselmo Avenue! Concerts will be at Creek Park and the Town Hall Plaza between 5:30pm to 8:30pm on Fridays and Saturdays.

**Music Events at the Marin Country Mart**

Larkspur follows its own beat at several musical events taking place in the courtyard of the artisan paradise known as [Marin Country Mart](http://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/shopping-centers/marin-country-mart/), where you’ll find everything from local brands specializing in handmade crafts, eco-friendly products and more.

The Farmers' Market at the Mart delivers outdoor live music by revolving artists each Saturday from 11:00 am to 2:00 pm while you shop for fresh organic produce. Each shopping day features different musical styles. Check the Marin Country Mart [website](https://www.marincountrymart.com/events) for up-to-date activities happening all summer long in Larkspur. 

**Concerts on the Plaza in Mill Valley**

**In** Friends Field near downtown [Mill Valley](https://www.millvalleymusicfest.com/), the annual Music Fest kicks off with local favorites. The Mill Valley Arts Commission will again host the concerts, featuring new artists and local favorites across a range of musical genres. This year, the concert dates are May 10 and May 11, 2025

Continuing in June is Mill Valley's [Comedy on the Plaza](https://enjoymillvalley.com/special-events/). Bring a chair and pick up a picnic dinner from one of the local shops or restaurants 

The Depot at Mill Valley is the center of this bustling town. Once a train depot, the spot now includes a large, open space for kids to play and a sweet café with patio tables so you can enjoy the ambiance in the shade. The Depot Plaza is a great place to people-watch—even more exciting during the summer concert series.

Bring your dancing shoes, as these beats tend to bring out the boogie in most who attend this outdoor event.

**Marin County Fair**

The Civic Center Fairgrounds in [San Rafael](https://www.visitmarin.org/places/san-rafael/) is home to Marin’s most beloved summer tradition: the [Marin County Fair](https://marinfair.org/). If there’s one place to pig out on all your favorite foods, it’s here, July 2nd through July 6th - _Bug-Tastic!_. 

The 2025 fair will focus on outdoor headline entertainment, performers roaming the grounds such as jugglers, unicyclists, and stilt walkers, and interactive art experiences for fans of all ages. Returning fair favorites will include traditional carnival rides, the Global Marketplace, food and drinks, and fireworks over the Civic Center’s Lagoon Park. The always-popular competitive exhibits program will take place online as it has in the past.

While fairgoers enjoy live music, carnival rides and games, dozens of outdoor grills will be cooking crowd favorites like grilled corn on the cob, turkey legs, fried artichokes, churros and other goodies it’s best to only eat once a year.

Celebrated as the Healthiest and Greenest County Fair on Earth since 2008, the Marin County Fair proudly features a solar-powered carousel, a solar-powered stage, and a 92% waste diversion rate. The Fair offers fresh and healthy food choices, alcohol-free sponsorships, and a smoke-free environment for the enjoyment of all.

**Novato Art, Wine, and Music Festival**

[Novato](https://www.visitmarin.org/places/novato) is a charming city east of Point Reyes and just north of the San Francisco Bay. The city is known for promoting a healthy and athletic lifestyle, showcased in the city’s 2,600 acres of open space.

On June 7 and 8, Novato hosts the 42nd Annual [Novato Festival of Art, Wine & Music](https://www.novato.org/government/parks-recreation-community-services/events)[:](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2022/june-2022/novato-festival-of-art-wine-and-music-1/) a family-friendly street fair celebrating the area’s unique art, wine and popular music. Join the Chamber of Commerce for this free event in downtown Novato along Grant Avenue. 

Kids will enjoy carnival-style games and attractions, craft stations, and a chance to greet members of the Novato police and fire departments. The event also features two stages for live music, beer and wine tastings, and some of Novato’s best bites. Don’t miss the microbrews from [Hopmonk Tavern](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/nightlife/bars/hopmonk-tavern-novato/) or a vintage from [Trek Winery](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/food-and-wine/trek-winery-1-1/); they’re both popular local spots in Novato.

**Terrapin Roadshow**

Join the [Terrapin Roadshow](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2025/july-2025/terrapin-roadshow-at-forest-meadows-amphitheatre-july-18-20-2025/) in San Rafael, July 18-20, at the Forest Meadows Amphitheatre!  
With a rotating cast of all-star musicians, each day features a different mix of these artists—ensuring that no two performances are the same. Groove to Grateful Dead-inspired jams with Stu Allen, Grahame Lesh, and friends. Expect unforgettable collaborations, deep musical connections, and the signature magic that made Terrapin Crossroads a beloved live music hub. Tickets on sale now—grab yours for an unforgettable musical adventure.

**Sound Summit**

The historic Mountain Theater at [Mount Tamalpais State Park](http://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/camping/mount-tamalpais-state-park/) is where you’ll find another exciting summer event in Marin: [Sound Summit](https://www.facebook.com/tamsoundsummit/), a daylong festival in September sponsored by the Roots & Branches Conservancy, a nature and culture conservation organization headquartered in Marin.

Bring a blanket and plenty of sunscreen, and enjoy live music from popular bands like Wilco and The Stone Foxes _,_ with unbelievable views of the Bay Area in the background.

There will be festival food and drinks available for purchase, as well as silent auction items to help raise money for Mount Tamalpais State Park.

Last year’s 2024 event sold out quickly! Get your tickets in advance, and enjoy rockin’ out on a mountaintop with friends and family for a worthy cause.
