# Start the Year Off With New Experiences in Marin

Posted Wednesday, February 19, 2025 by MCVB Staff

By Joe Kukura

Sunshine and warm weather are the antidote to the post-holiday hangover, and the famed wine country destination of Marin County has plenty of both all winter long. The mild, Mediterranean-style weather of the “sunny side of the Golden Gate Bridge” makes it an ideal destination for a winter getaway. You have a brand-new calendar ready to pack with plans and activities, and Marin County is waiting with outdoor fun and farm-to-table food experiences, all with the iconic backdrop of the area’s unbelievable scenery.

**Golf at Peacock Gap**

Much like your new year, San Rafael’s [Peacock Gap Golf Club](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/sports/peacock-gap-golf-club-1/) is refreshed, renovated, and restored. While the 18-hole golf course is a Marin County legacy dating back nearly 60 years, the club has recently upgraded with multimillion-dollar improvements to add stunning modern architecture, ballrooms, a magnificent outdoor deck and a five-star restaurant featuring San Rafael’s renowned Head Chef John Evans.

But it’s Peacock Gap’s golf course—designed by Torrey Pines designer William F. Bell—that is indeed the main course and a great place to improve your game. Recently renovated with a real grass driving range, this course offers beautifully laid-out chipping areas and practice greens to build your skills. Or better yet, schedule a personal lesson with one of the Peacock Gap Golf Club instructors, many of whom are current and former PGA Tour competitors. Junior classes are also available, so bring the kids!

**Farm Cheese Tastings**

Cheese tasting in Marin County is always a scrumptious endeavor, and the [Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Company](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/food-and-wine/the-fork-at-point-reyes-farmstead-cheese-company-1/) has several cheese events that will really get your goat. The Giacomini family’s pastoral 720-acre ranch has a centerpiece culinary and educational center called [The Fork](https://pointreyescheese.com/pages/about-the-fork), and cheeseheads will love it there. 

Try the _Cheese Lovers Tasting with Farm Tour_ and enjoy the view from your private table overlooking the farm on Tomales Bay. Your group will enjoy an abundant cheeseboard with award-winning cheeses and a seasonal chef's lunch. Menu items are specially created to showcase and pair with cheeses to round out your cheese-tasting experience perfectly. This option is ideal for groups looking to stretch their tasting into a full meal. Your host for the day (aka your personal cheese concierge) will give an informational farm talk that includes the history of the Giacomini dairy, their many sustainability measures, and the inside scoop on the day-to-day operations.

**Wildlife Tracking**

While much of the country slogs through a dreary winter, Marin’s lush, warm winters make for great [winter wildlife watching](https://www.visitmarin.org/blog/the-best-winter-wildlife-watching-in-marin/). Whales, egrets, elephant seals and other wonderful migratory animals make Marin County their warm winter home.

The [Point Reyes National Seashore](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/beaches-in-marin-county/point-reyes-national-seashore/) hosts many classes and [events](https://www.ptreyes.org/events) including monthly Full Moon Hikes and an Annual Christmas Bird Count! [The Annual Christmas Bird Count](https://ptreyes.org/programs-events/) happens every January and is for families with children ages 3-18. The event brings together all the basic elements of birding to introduce the next generation of stewards to the importance of birds in the ecosystem and the annual tradition of bird counts. Point Reyes National Seashore is an ideal location for birding with 54% of all North American birds having been recorded here. Local experts will lead groups on different trails for a fun day of counting and identifying.

**Winter Paddle Racing**

The placid and pretty waters of San Rafael Creek make for great paddleboarding and kayaking, whether you’re brand new or a pro.

San Rafael’s [101 Surf Sports](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/guided-tours/101-surf-sports-1/) hosts paddlers of all skill levels for great morning paddle parties with fun family races for all skill levels. At 101 Surf Sports’ winter paddle racing events, raceboards and race paddle rentals are available on site, and kids get to race for free.

**Exploring the Arts**

Marin County and wine country are well-known havens for artisans and their art, and San Rafael’s [Art Works ](https://visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/art-studios-and-galleries/art-works-downtown-inc/)[Downtown](https://visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/art-studios-and-galleries/art-works-downtown-inc/) draws the finest in artists and instructors. There are always terrific art events scheduled at Art Works Downtown, so plan your Marin County getaway around its gallery exhibits, events and art classes for adults and kids.

Or for a fun Friday night, the 2nd Friday Art Walk comes to downtown San Rafael’s Fourth Street with warm treats, hot cider and, of course, plenty of great art to enjoy.

There are no winter blues in Marin County, just lush green landscapes and good times in the great outdoors. With a fresh new calendar and a fresh new year, make a resolution for a Marin County escape that will really lift your spirits.
