# Tribute to Spike Lee at The Mill Valley Film Festival

**Date** : Saturday, October 11, 2025

**Time** : 7:15 pm in various theaters

**Phone** : 877-874.-6833

The Mill Valley Film Festival is thrilled to present clips and conversation with the inimitable Spike Lee. For over 45 years, Spike Lee has been carving out an indelible place in cinema with a tireless and endlessly curious work aesthetic that includes documentaries, narratives, episodics, music videos, short films, and more. His debut feature  _She’s Gotta Have It_(1986) brought a shot of adrenaline into the American indie scene while his latest  _Highest and Lowest_****(2025) cements his place as a poet of New York City and a storyteller of immense range and style. His production company, 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks, nurtures and mentors aspiring actors and craftspeople in all realms of filmmaking. His work transcends genres and tidy categories, it is bold and funny and challenging and unclassifiable. Be prepared for an unforgettable event with a true master of cinema.

Celebrating 48 years of film in Marin County from October 2nd through October 12th! The internationally renowned Mill Valley Film Festival offers a high-profile, prestigious, non-competitive environment ideal for celebrating the best in independent and world cinema. MVFF (the oldest fall film festival in California) remains committed to celebrating film and filmmakers and offering the highest resources and production elements possible, whatever challenges the world throws our way. We are approaching 2025 with the same commitment to quality and openness as we plan to showcase new cinema at MVFF48.
