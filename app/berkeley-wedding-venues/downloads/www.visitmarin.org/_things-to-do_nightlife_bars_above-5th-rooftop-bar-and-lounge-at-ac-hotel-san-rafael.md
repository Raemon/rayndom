Tamalpais and the surrounding Marin County, Above Fifth is a destination for curated cocktails, local beer and wine alongside a seasonal and locally sourced menu of small plates. Its loungey atmosphere and casual vibe coupled with its stunning natural backdrop make it an ideal destination to meet friends for happy hour or a nightcap by a firepit after dinner downtown.

Above Fifth offers a seasonal [menu](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-DmqhaNwp7_I4Ix7qXtriD9OxJF1o1a0/view?usp=sharing) of shareable small plates emphasizing local products and ingredients.
