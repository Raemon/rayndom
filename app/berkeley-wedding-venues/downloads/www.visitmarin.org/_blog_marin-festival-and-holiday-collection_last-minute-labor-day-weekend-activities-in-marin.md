# Last-Minute Labor Day Weekend Activities in Marin

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Tuesday, August 5, 2025 by MCVB Staff

By Megan Eileen McDonough

Summer’s not over just yet! Soak up the sun, sand and surf this year (and maybe even stop to shop) in Marin County, where you’ll have your pick of activities. From horseback riding to gazing at the stars, you’re in for a real treat. Here are a few of our favorite ways to enjoy a long weekend in Marin...even if you’re planning last minute!

**Try a New Sport**

Just because it’s a holiday weekend doesn’t mean local attractions are closed. In fact, any long weekend is the perfect time of the year to try something new, especially a hobby or sport. [Five Brooks Ranch](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/horseback-riding/five-brooks-ranch/), a full-service riding stable, offers a fun activity for the whole family and a scenic way to find the best views from [Point Reyes National Seashore](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/beaches-in-marin-county/point-reyes-national-seashore/).

Alternatively, take a golf lesson at San Rafael’s [Peacock Gap Golf Club](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/sports/peacock-gap-golf-club-1/), which has renovated greens and updated practice facilities that help create an exceptional golf experience. All skill levels are welcome. Afterward, reward yourself with a classic cocktail or ice-cold beer at the relaxed RangeCafe.

Never been kayaking before and looking for adventure? Let Blue Waters Kayaking take you on a learning tour of Drake's Estero. It is one of the most stunning places to paddle on the California Coast. First-time kayakers are welcome.

**Indulge in Honey and Mead**

What better excuse to indulge in honey and mead than a weekend holiday. Once a month, [Heidrun Meadery](https://www.visitmarin.org/green-marin/agri-tourism-farm-to-fork-experiences/heidrun-meadery/) hosts a special Flower to Flute beekeeping experience through October. Don a beekeeping suit and head out to the apiary on September 11th for a hands-on inspection of working hives. Learn how honey is made into mead and then relax while tasting the best mead ever! If that is not your thing, bring friends and family for a picnic or drop in to wet your whistle after a refreshing hike in the national park next door. Enjoy a guided tasting of superlative sparkling meads or simply order a bottle on ice for an intimate sitting on the patio. Essential Tasting flights are available 7 days a week from 11:00 to 5:00.

**Shop ’Til You Drop**

Calling all souvenir seekers! Marin’s towns and cities are a colorful representation of the local culture, with each [neighborhood shopping district](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/) more distinctive than the last. On any given day, you’ll find a little bit of everything: antiques, fine arts, one-of-a-kind crafts, handmade gifts and home furnishings. ArtWorks Downtown in San Rafael is a good starting point as it features four galleries, 28 studios, a jewelers’ guild and more. You’ll even be able to see several artists working on their latest creations.

[Strawberry Village](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/shopping-centers/strawberry-village/) in Mill Valley is a go-to spot for savvy shoppers, and for good reason. There are home and decor stores, specialty shops, boutiques for well-being, spas and salons, and eateries with al fresco dining options. Shop for souvenirs and local products in the morning, and then recharge over an organic lunch.

**Outdoor Music Concerts, Movies, and Dining**

Marin loves keeping people busy in the outdoors with a variety of concerts, movies, and dining options under the stars. At the [Marin County Mart](https://marincountrymart.com/events), outdoor movies for children are offered every Friday night through November _._ The [Corte Madera Town Center](https://www.shoptowncenter.com/) continues its Summer Concert Series every Sunday afternoon through September. Don't miss [HopMonk's Cookout Series](https://wl.seetickets.us/HopMonkNovato) in Novato.  
We hope you enjoy some of these last-minute ideas for a great long holiday weekend!
