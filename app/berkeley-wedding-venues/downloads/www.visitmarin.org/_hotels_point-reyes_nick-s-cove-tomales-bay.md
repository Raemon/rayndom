# Nick’s Cove Tomales Bay




**Nick’s Cove Tomales Bay**  
23240 Highway One  
Marshall, CA 94940

Nestled on Tomales Bay, Nick’s Cove is a destination that warmly embraces locals and travelers alike whether you have a few hours to visit or a few days to explore. The seaside sanctuary boasts newly remodeled restaurant, bar and cottages to serve as a favorite post-beach stop or an overnight getaway. Make Nick’s Cove your local retreat to slow down and unwind (with craft cocktail in hand) or a launch point to discover the bounty of West Marin. 

Our unique cottages are a retreat from the noise of everyday life. Snuggled in a serene, sheltered cove of Tomales Bay, our accommodations are the perfect combination of rustic charm and luxurious comfort. Each distinctly designed cottage is an elegant hideaway, beautifully appointed with plush down comforters, wood burning stoves, and bathrooms equipped with heated tile floors and soaking tubs. The picturesque waterside setting creates a majestic backdrop to slow down, refresh, and reconnect. 

We have paddleboards & kayaks, gardens, bocce ball, live music onsite, as well as epic hiking and beach-combing nearby.
