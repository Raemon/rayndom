# Farmers’ Markets in Marin

Posted in [Best Marin Attractions](/tools/blog-categories/best-marin-attractions/) on Wednesday, May 21, 2025 by MCVB Staff

Looking for farm-fresh kale or fresh artisan cheeses? Organic raspberries or stone fruit? Fresh chard or fresh-pressed olive oil? 

[Marin's Agricultural Institute](https://www.agriculturalinstitute.org/): It’s all presented in delightful seasonal variety, direct from the producers, at the third largest farmers' market in California on [Thursdays](https://www.agriculturalinstitute.org/thursday-marin) and [Sundays](https://www.agriculturalinstitute.org/sunday-marin) at the San Rafael Civic Center.

The market celebrates over 40 years with more than 190 farms participating throughout the year and more than 300 varieties of farm-fresh fruits and vegetables. The market also features 60 gourmet food purveyors and 100 artisans throughout the year selling many other gourmet food items, from specialty smoked salmon, artisan baked bread, honey, jam and hot sauces.

The market is not only fun for shopping, on Sundays, there are activities for kids, like pony rides and inflatable jumpies. So grab a market basket and a big floppy hat (it can be hot in summer), and bring your taste buds (free samples are abundant) to the San Rafael Civic Center for an awesome day at Marin's best farmers' market.
