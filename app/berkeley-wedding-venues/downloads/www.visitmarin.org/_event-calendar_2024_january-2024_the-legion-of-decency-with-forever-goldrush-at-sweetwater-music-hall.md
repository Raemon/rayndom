The Legion of Decency is an Americana band out of California. The debut album, Deep Lines Among the Shallows, features Rami Jaffee from The Foo Fighters, Doug Pettibone from Lucinda Williams, Gabe Nelson of Cake, Dusty Watson of the Supersuckers and Nashville Pussy, Tay Strathairn from Dawes, harp player Jason Ricci and many more. Singer-songwriter, Michael Tamony, produced and recorded the record and has played The Troubador, The Mint, Old Ironsides, The Press Club, and numerous other venues. The Legion of Decency has also been featured on NPR’s American Parlor Songbook, KVCR, and CapRadio.

Forever Goldrush is a Californian alternative pop/rock four-piece band formed in 1997 when a group of childhood friends decided to seriously mix their passion for country, folk, and blues. Singer/songwriter Damon Wyckoff, bassist Mason Demusey, guitarist Josh Lacey, and drummer Nate Gonzalez sharpened their rowdy roots rock for a melodic torch and twang. Soon, Forever Goldrush (hence the name, for the historical event of 1849) started playing gigs, landing opening spots with Train, the Damnations TX , Marshall Crenshaw, Deathray, and others. In 1999, the band released their debut Unknown Territory, which won Forever Goldrush local praise and a SAMMIE (Sacramento Area Music Award) for Best New Band and Local CD of the Year. The following year, Forever Goldrush inked a deal with Headhunter Records/Cargo Music and issued Halo in My Backpack in fall 2000.

General Admission Tickets are $20.00, plus service fees and can be purchased in the above website link. Day of Show tickets are $25.00 each, plus service fees.
