China Camp State Park is located on the southwest shore of San Pablo Bay, three miles northeast of downtown San Rafael. The park protects roughly 1,500 acres of oak woodlands and meadows, and 100 acres of fresh and saltwater wetlands, including some of the most pristine tidal wetlands in the San Francisco Bay Area. A sandy beach fronts historic China Camp Village, a Chinese shrimp-fishing village that dates back to the 1860s. Vintage structures and a small museum trace the story of this significant chapter in Chinese-American history. The original cafe offers drinks and light fare; typically open Friday - Sunday. The state park also features roughly 15 miles of multi-use trails looping through oak woodlands and climbing 1,000 feet to the top of San Pablo Ridge, offering sweeping views of the Bay Area. 

There are 15 miles of multi-use trails for hiking, trail-running, mountain biking, and horseback riding. 

As for pets, no pets on trails. Dogs are allowed only on a maximum 6-foot fixed leash in Back Ranch Meadows Campground, on paved roads, and at China Camp Village Beach. 

Tent-Only campsites are available within Back Ranch Meadows Campground, including 33 walk-in tent only and 3 hike in / bike-in sites, each with an outdoor grill and fire ring. Potable water, hot showers, and flush toilets are on site. [Nightly campsite rates and reservation details here](https://friendsofchinacamp.org/visit-the-park/camping/).

ADA Accessibility on Trails: Turtle Back Nature Trail and a 1.5-mile length of Shoreline Trail are ADA compliant. Two campsites are ADA compliant. 

Since 2012, the state park has been managed by Friends of China Camp, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Since the park receives no direct funding or tax dollars from the state, FOCC charges a small fee for trail use and parking at select locations. Annual memberships are also available.

**Hours:** Open Daily 8:00 a.m. to sunset, year round
