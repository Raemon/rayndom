# Best Fall Events in Fabulous Marin County

Posted in [Best Marin Attractions](/tools/blog-categories/best-marin-attractions/) on Tuesday, October 21, 2025 by MCVB Staff

By John Egan

Although Marin County is perfect year-round for outdoor activities, such as [hiking](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/hiking/), [cycling](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/mountain-biking-and-road-cycling/) and [kayaking](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/kayaking-water-sports/), sometimes a little eating, drinking, and culture is on the agenda and mind.

Marin County hosts a cornucopia of events this fall that fit the bill, and like the colors of fall leaves, [these events](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/) offer quite a variety. We’ve picked several of the many fantastic fall events in Marin County to put on your calendar now.

**Mill Valley Film Festival**

_October 2 through 12, 2025_

The internationally renowned [Mill Valley Film Festival](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2025/october-2025/the-mill-valley-film-festival-46/) offers a high-profile, prestigious, non-competitive environment perfect for celebrating the best in independent and world cinema. The MVFF (the oldest fall film festival in California) remains committed to celebrating film and filmmakers and offering the highest resources and production elements possible, whatever challenges the world throws our way. We are approaching 2025 with the same commitment to quality and openness to opportunity as we plan for our showcase of new cinema at MVFF48. Watch this year's festival trailer on the [MVFF's](https://www.mvff.com/) website of movies to be shown!

**Marin Symphony (2025-2026 Season)**

_The Season begins on October 4, 2025_

[Marin Symphony](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/arts-entertainment-cultural/marin-symphony/) opens its 2025 - 2026 season with Chamber Music 1: Schubert's Trout Quintet

Grażyna Bacewicz’s astonishing quartet for four violins starts our season, and the concert concludes with Franz Schubert’s masterful Trout quintet, all performed by Marin Symphony all-stars. Stay after the concert for a Q & A with the panel of musicians!

A reception with refreshments is open to all ticket holders after the concert and discussion.

The season-opening concert will take place on Saturday, October 4, at 7:30 p.m. with a new temporary location at the Marin Country Club in Novato, and on Sunday, October 5, at 3 p.m. at the Mt. Tam Methodist Church in Mill Valley.

**Sound Summit 2025**

This year's [Sound Summit](https://www.soundsummit.net/) returns to benefit Mt. Tam this September 13th and will boast a lineup led by "Lord Huron". Held in an intimate venue set amidst an expansive landscape, Sound Summit is a musical gathering like no other in the Bay Area. The festival is staged at the historic Mountain Theater, a 4000-seat natural stone amphitheater with stunning views of San Francisco Bay and beyond. Add a sun-filled day, a resonant cause, and a healthy dose of joy, spice generously with stellar music, and you have a recipe for a magical mountain brew.

**Get Dressed and Prepare for a Halloween in Marin**

_October 25 - 30th_

Corte Madera, [Mill Valley](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2025/october-2025/halloween-at-mill-valley-community-center/), San Rafael, and [Novato](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2025/october-2025/trick-or-treat-in-downtown-novato/) will be serving up some safe, family-friendly Halloween fun on the weekend before the big day.

From 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 25, you and your costumed kids can take part in the [Annual Downtown San Rafael Trick-or-Treat](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2025/october-2025/trick-or-treat-on-fourth-street-in-downtwon-san-rafael/) event along the Fourth Street corridor. Admission is free. Festivities will include trick-or-treating at participating downtown shops, handouts of free candy bags at City Plaza and performances of live music.

The following day, Sunday, Oct. 26, in [Corte Madera](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2025/october-2025/trick-or-treat-at-town-center-corte-madera/), kids and adults get another chance to unmask more Halloween activities during a trick-or-treat event at Town Center Corte Madera from noon to 4 p.m. Kids will receive free candy from local merchants and free balloons from Balloon Delights.

At the Hopmonk in Novato on October 31st, GET READY FOR A FUNKTASTIC HALLOWEEN BASH PARTY with [Pride and Joy](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2025/october-2025/pride-joy-halloween-bash-at-hopmonk-tavern/)! During its many years of phenomenal success, Pride & Joy has remained the most popular party band on the Bay Area music scene. This group is the Pride of the Bay Area and a Joy to anyone who loves to dance. 

At the [Sweetwater Music Hall](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2025/october-2025/soul-ska-halloween-party-at-sweetwater-music-hall/), don't miss another great Halloween night of music with Soul Ska, a Bay Area collective with a fresh take on the classic ska/rocksteady idiom. The 10 piece band is comprised of veteran members of Bay Area bands such as Vinyl, Stymie & the Pimp Jones Love Orchestra, The Right Time, Albino!, El Radio Fantastique, Jethro Jeremiah Band and more.
