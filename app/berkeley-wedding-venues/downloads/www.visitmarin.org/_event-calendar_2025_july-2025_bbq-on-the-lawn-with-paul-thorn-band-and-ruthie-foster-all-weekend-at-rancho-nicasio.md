# BBQ on the Lawn with Paul Thorn Band and Ruthie Foster all Weekend at Rancho Nicasio

**Date** : Saturday, July 26, 2025

**Time** : Gates Open at 3:00pm and Music Starts at 4:00pm

[**Website**](https://ci.ovationtix.com/35892/performance/11605046?performanceId=11605046)

Paul Thorn has created an innovative and impressive career, pleasing crowds with his muscular brand of roots music – bluesy, rocking and thoroughly Southern American, yet also speaking universal truths. Among those who value originality, inspiration, eccentricity and character – as well as talent that hovers somewhere on the outskirts of genius, the story of Paul Thorn is already familiar. Born in Tupelo, Mississippi, raised among the same spirits (and some of the actual people) who nurtured the young Elvis generations before, Paul Thorn has rambled down back roads and jumped out of airplanes, worked for years in a furniture factory, battled four-time world champion boxer Roberto Duran on national television, performed on stages with Bonnie Raitt, Mark Knopfler, Sting, and John Prine among many others, and made some of the most emotionally restless yet fully accessible music of our time.

As the milestone tenth studio album from folk-blues luminary Ruthie Foster, Mileage finds the singer-songwriter reflecting on a life full of professional triumphs, personal loss, and a musical journey that took a self-described “little Black girl with a guitar” from singing at churches in rural Texas to chalking up multiple Grammy nominations and collaborating with fellow greats such as Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks.  
  
Tickets are $61.00 per person and can be purchased in the above website link. Please note, ticket price is for admission only. All food/BBQ and beverages are available for purchase.
