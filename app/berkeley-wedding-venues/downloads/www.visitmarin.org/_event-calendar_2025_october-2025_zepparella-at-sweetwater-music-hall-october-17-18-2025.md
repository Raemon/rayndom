# Zepparella at Sweetwater Music Hall, October 17-18, 2025

**Date** : Friday, October 17, 2025

**Time** : Doors Open at 7:00pm and Show Starts at 8:00pm

[**Website**](https://sweetwatermusichall.org/event/an-evening-with-zepparella/sweetwater-music-hall/mill-valley-california/)

An all-female American Led Zeppelin tribute band founded and formed in 2005 in San Francisco, California, by the band's drummer, Clementine. The current band consists of lead vocalist Anna Kristina, guitarist Gretchen Menn, bassist Holly West, and drummer Clementine.

Drummer Clementine is the founding member of ZEPPARELLA. From the beginning of her musical career, her goal has been to be onstage every night. The pursuit of that goal has led Clementine to constantly tour the US and Europe in projects as diverse as Bottom, AC/DShe, The House Of More, The Solid, Francis Bakin, Stars Turn Me On and Beaux Cheveux. She tackles the best rock drumming ever written with her own emotionally powerful style, bringing the Motown influence of the Bonham groove to the forefront. The profound musical connection established with Gretchen Menn (guitar), Holly West (bass), and Anna Kristina (vocals) creates the bond required to do this great music justice.

Now more than ever, Zepparella explores their own improvised magic within the framework of Zeppelin’s mighty songs!

General Admission Tickets are $40.69 per person in advance and $46.87 on day of show. All tickets can be purchased in the above website link.
