# Live on the Avenue Concerts in San Anselmo

**Date** : Saturday, June 28, 2025

**Time** : 6:00pm - 8:30pm

[**Website**](https://www.liveontheavenue.org/band-schedule)

San Anselmo’s Live On The Avenue transforms our downtown into a vibrant community hub, offering free live entertainment and relaxed, cozy evenings. We've cultivated a true 'Third Place'—a vital space for connection and unwinding, beyond the home and workplace. Picture strolling down a pedestrian-friendly avenue, where the atmosphere is warm and welcoming.

Our events feature two distinct stages: Creek Park Amphitheater, nestled in a serene redwood grove, provides a lush lawn perfect for picnics and enjoying the best of Bay Area music. Meanwhile, Town Hall Plaza, with its iconic backdrop, extends its musical embrace onto the closed avenue and into nearby restaurants.

We've created a place where you can stroll, shop, dine, and connect with neighbors and visitors alike. It's a unique blend of small-town charm and Bay Area vibrancy, where musicians eagerly take the stage, and the community comes together. 

**Friday, June 20:** Walking Mirrors at Creek Park and Black Cat Zydeco at Town Hall Plaza  
**Saturday, June 21:** Rojai and The Pocket at Creek Park and Pickled Fish Trio at Town Hall Plaza  
  
**Friday, June 27:** Essence and Gold Country at Creek Park and Matt Jaffe Band at Town Hall Plaza  
**Saturday, June 28:** Big Blue Soul Revue at Creek Park and The Dorian Mode at Town Hall Plaza
