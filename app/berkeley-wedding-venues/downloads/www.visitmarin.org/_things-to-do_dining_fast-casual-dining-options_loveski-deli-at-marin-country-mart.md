Loveski is a “jew-ish” deli born out of Northern California by Christopher and Martina Kostow. At Loveski, the traditional elements of the deli and appetizing stores are imbued with the sensibilities and flavors of California, Napa Valley, and the tastes of Martina and Christopher’s lives- including elements of Martina’s Thai heritage, and a focus on their farm and local artisans. Featuring handmade sourdough bagels, house-made pickles and other ferments, vegetables from our farm, and the best cured and smoked meats. 

The menu at Loveski Marin remains reflective of Chef Kostow’s culinary philosophy and closely held traditions, while continuing to include influences from Martina’s Thai American upbringing. With Napa Valley favorites joining the Marin menu, there will be new and expanded offerings for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Guests will also be able to enjoy a robust grocery experience with grab n’ go salads and sandwiches, sweet pastries, and freshly made bagels and spreads. The beverage program includes both alcoholic and non-alcoholic selections as well as an extensive coffee program, providing specialty drinks and brewed favorites. Menu Here
