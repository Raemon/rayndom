Il Davide is considered one of the best Italian restaurants in Marin. Owner / Chef David Haydon is the master behind Il Davide and is often found in the restaurant or providing catering to the many events, galas and charity fundraisers that Marin has to offer.

House Specialties are ravioli, tortellini, agnolotti and gnocchi and they are all made in-house. Il Davide’s extensive wine list, primarily Californian and Italian, has received and maintains a Wine Spectator Award of Excellence. Bottles range from $30 to $250, with a wide range of choices in between. Flights are offered, as well as 29 wines by the glass (and the pour is not stingy).
