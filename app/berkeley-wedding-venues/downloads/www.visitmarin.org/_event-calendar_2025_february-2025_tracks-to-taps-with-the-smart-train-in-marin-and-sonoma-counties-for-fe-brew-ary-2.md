# Tracks to Taps with the SMART Train in Marin and Sonoma Counties for Fe-BREW-ary

**Date** : Thursday, February 13, 2025

[**Website**](https://www.sonomamarintrain.org/TracksToTaps)

SMART is your ticket to celebrating [FeBREWary](https://www.sonomamarintrain.org/Trackstotaps) – a month-long craft brewery event featuring beer tastings, tours, tap takeovers, and special limited-edition releases of craft beers that you won’t want to miss!

Dozens of craft breweries are within walking distance of a SMART station and others can be reached with the [SMART Connect](https://www.sonomamarintrain.org/connect) shuttle, the free LumaGo shuttle, and the free [Santa Rosa Craft Beer Shuttle](https://www.sonomamarintrain.org/sites/default/files/Documents/2025CraftBeerShuttleSchedule.pdf).

The [Santa Rosa Beer Passport](https://www.visitsantarosa.com/beerpassport/) is a great way to experience the best of Santa Rosa's craft beer scene. And, FeBREWary in [Downtown San Rafael](https://downtownsanrafael.org/events/) is the perfect opportunity to expand your beer IQ and hoist a pint with friends.

_**Thank you for drinking responsibly and leaving the driving to us!**_
