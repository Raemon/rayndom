# Petals & Ice Exhibit: The Adventures of Louise A. Boyd at Boyd Gate House Thru September 2024

**Date** : Wednesday, June 26, 2024

**Time** : Open 10:00am - 2:00pm Wednesday - Friday and 11:00am - 3:00pm on Saturday

[**Website**](https://www.marinhistory.org/Petals&Ice)

The Marin History Museum recently opened the Petals & Ice: The Adventures of Louise A. Boyd exhibit celebrating the remarkable life of Louise A. Boyd—a polar explorer, adventurer, and photographer —a polar explorer, adventurer, and photographer extraordinaire. In addition, for a six-month period, neverbefore seen photographs of the interior of Maple Lawn taken by Ansel Adams are also on display. While this exhibit chronicles many aspects of Louise Boyd’s life…it most importantly answers why her achievements and contributions are still relevant many decades later. Some of those include:

(1) Louise Boyd was the second woman ever to receive the Cullum Medal of the American Geographical Society.

(2) Became the first woman to ever fly over the North Pole at 67 years old… a 16-hour non-stop flight.

(3) During WWII, she used these skills in Washington DC as a special consultant to the Military Intelligence Division.

And…who would have guessed that this artic explorer, photographer, scientist and author would also be considered the Most Interesting Dinner Guest” in San Francisco in her later life?
