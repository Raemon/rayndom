Located in the Marin Country Mart, Farmshop Marin is a culinary beacon on the bay sitting a stone's throw from the Larkspur Landing ferry dock offering up a full-flavored experience with style, finesse and comfort. Utilizing all our locale has to offer partake of Northern California in every glass, on every plate, in every bite. We collaborate closely with farmers and producers, fostering connections that extend beyond mere business dealings and into personal territory. By visiting the farms and immersing ourselves in their world, we gain a deep appreciation for the journey each ingredient makes from the earth to our kitchen, and finally to your plate.
