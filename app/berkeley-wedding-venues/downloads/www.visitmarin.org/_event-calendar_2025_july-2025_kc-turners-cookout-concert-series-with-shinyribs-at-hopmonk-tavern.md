# KC Turner's Cookout Concert Series with Shinyribs at HopMonk Tavern

**Date** : Sunday, July 20, 2025

**Time** : Doors Open at 4:30pm and Show Starts at 6:00pm

[**Website**](https://wl.seetickets.us/event/shinyribs/642055?afflky=HopMonkNovato)

SHINYRIBS defies genres as a sonic melting pot of Texas blues, New Orleans R&B funk, horn-driven Memphis soul, country twang, border music, big band swing, and roots-rock. The Austin-based nine-piece (sometimes 10-piece) supergroup is led by Kevin Russell, the charismatic frontman with colorful suits and extravagant shoes who continuously swaps out an electric guitar for a ukulele and never falls short of creating a cinematic experience with on-stage antics that often include him donning a light-up cloak or leading a conga line through the crowd.

Shinyribs was named Best Austin Band at the Austin Chronicle’s Austin Music Awards (2017, 2018), awarded Album of the Year for I Got Your Medicine (2017), and Best 2020-Themed Song for "Stay Home" (2020). Russell’s Shinyribs have recorded six albums: 2010’s Well After Awhile; Gulf Coast Museum (2013); Okra Candy (2015); 2017’s award-winning I Got Your Medicine; a compilation of holiday standards and new compositions The Kringle Tingle (2018); and the group’s latest soulful release, Fog & Bling (2019). Shinyribs latest project, Late Night TV Gold, released in August 2021.

General Admission Tickets are $38.86 per person. General Admission, plus a cookout meal is $63.73 per person. All tickets can be purchased in the above website link.
