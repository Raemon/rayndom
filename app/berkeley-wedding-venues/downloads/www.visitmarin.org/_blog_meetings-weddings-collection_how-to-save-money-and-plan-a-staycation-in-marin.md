Californians seeking extraordinary encounters close to home will want to plan their next staycation in idyllic Marin County with its picturesque forests, vibrant cities, towns and majestic coastlines.

But it’s the [things to do in Marin County](/things-to-do/) that make it an enticing staycation destination.

There are plenty of attractions for a [Marin County romantic getaway](https://www.visitmarin.org/hotels/), and the [shopping in Marin County](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/) will suit everyone’s style.
