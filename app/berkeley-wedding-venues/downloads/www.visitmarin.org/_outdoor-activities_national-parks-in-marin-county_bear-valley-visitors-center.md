Before exploring the Point Reyes National Seashore, a visit to the Bear Valley Visitors Center is in order. The Center provides an orientation to the park’s roads, trails and general history. It also offers ecological and historical exhibits including a seismograph, weather station and auditorium for films and educational programs. The Bear Valley Visitor Center was designed to blend in with the historically significant ranching culture of this area and is located in the heart of the Olema Valley. 

Reservations and permits for back-country camping can be obtained here. The Visitor Center is open year around and closed on Christmas.  
  
**Hours of Operation:** Open Daily from 9:30am – 5:00pm and closed on Christmas Day
