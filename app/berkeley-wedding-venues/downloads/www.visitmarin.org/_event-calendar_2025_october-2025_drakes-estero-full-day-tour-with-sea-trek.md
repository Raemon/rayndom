# Drakes Estero Full Day Tour with Sea Trek

**Date** : Sunday, October 12, 2025

**Time** : 9:30am

[**Website**](https://www.seatrek.com/trips/drakes-estero-full-day/)

Drakes Estero is pound-for-pound one of the most beautiful places to kayak in terms of its pristine nature offering great wildlife sightings, expansive views, and the sense of going back in time. From our put-in site at the start of the estero, we’ll paddle out to the mouth and stop on a beach for lunch and a short hike.

Drakes Estero is a watery complex made up of five conjoining bays covering approximately 2,500 acres. During our paddle, you’re likely to see dozens of harbor seals; leopard shark and bat ray sightings are also typical. Birdlife includes cormorants, white pelicans, shorebirds, blue herons, egrets and more.

You don’t need to be an experienced kayaker for this trip, but you should be physically active. If you have passed our Advanced Sea Kayaking Class, you can choose to paddle in a single kayak. Everyone else must use a two-person kayak. Only a few dates are offered for this unique trip as Drakes is closed for the harbor seal pupping season March 1 – June 30 each year. Bring your own lunch. 

No Experience Necessary, but you should be physically active.  
Duration: 6 hours  
Cost: $195 for adults and $145 for kids (minimum age is 16 years old). Please visit the above website link for more details and to make reservations.
