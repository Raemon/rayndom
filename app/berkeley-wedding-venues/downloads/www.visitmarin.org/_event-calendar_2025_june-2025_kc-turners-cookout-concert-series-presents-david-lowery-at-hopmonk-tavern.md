# KC Turners Cookout Concert Series Presents David Lowery at HopMonk Tavern

**Date** : Friday, June 27, 2025

**Time** : Doors Open at 4:30pm and Show Starts at 6:00pm

[**Website**](https://wl.seetickets.us/event/david-lowery-of-camper-van-beethoven-and-cracker/644201?afflky=HopMonkNovato)

David Lowery is best known as the singer-songwriter and frontman for the two acclaimed bands Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven over the last four decades. He's been revered in leading the charge of the indie-rock movement with the formation of CVB in the early '80s, spawning such absurdist, left-field pop-rock gems as "Take The Skinheads Bowling," "The Day That Lassie Went To The Moon" and "(I Was Born In A) Laundromat," among countless others over the course of their nine studio albums together. 

After the initial break-up of CVB in 1990 (or as one New York media outlet phrased it "Camper Van Beethoven didn’t explode like Fleetwood Mac when they broke up, they dissolved like a urinal cake"), Lowery hooked up with guitarist and friend Johnny Hickman and formed Cracker - a band that successfully melded rock with country - and proved to be one of the small handful of acts in the early '90s to help spearhead the then burgeoning alt-county scene (grunge rock be damned). Cracker quickly blew up, scoring three Top 10 alternative/rock radio hits, as well as garnering two platinum and two gold albums. They've gone onto release nine studio albums, along with several live and compilation LPs,

In addition, Lowery has also produced a number of albums for acclaimed acts such as The Counting Crows and Sparklehorse. He also founded Sound of Music Studios in Richmond, VA with John Morand. This long running endeavor has produced tracks from artists as wide ranging as D’Angelo and Gwar. 

General Admission Tickets are $30.00 per person in advance and $35.00 on day of show; General Admission + a Cookout Meal is $54.00 per person. All tickets can be purchased in the above website link.
