# KC Turner Presents Gitkin at HopMonk Tavern

**Date** : Thursday, October 2, 2025

**Time** : Doors Open at 7:00pm and Show Starts at 8:00pm

[**Website**](https://wl.eventim.us/event/gitkin/656624?afflky=HopMonkNovato)

A lush, intoxicating gumbo of global soul, surf noir, and psychedelic funk, all filtered through a vintage, analog haze. Listening to Gitkin feels like stumbling across a forgotten reel-to-reel in a dusty Havana pawn shop or a smoky Marseilles speakeasy. There’s a deep sense of wanderlust baked into every groove — part spaghetti western, part Peruvian psych, with twangy guitars that slither like snakes through a desert bazaar.

New Orleans-based Gitkin, also known as Brian J Gitkin, a Grammy-nominated artist and producer renowned for his production skills (working with Cedric Burnside, Bernard Purdie, Cyril Neville) and as the mastermind behind the funk ensemble Pimps Of Joytime, is experiencing surprising success with this passion project.

Gitkin has self produced and recorded 4 full length albums in his home studio. "I go for a a sound that makes me happy. I love a sense of mystery in the tone, that's why I use a lot of analog gear, tape, spring reverb, analog delay. The analog approach tends to warm and friendly to the ear"

The latest album, Golden Age, is a natural progression of Gitkin’s sound, weaving together deep grooves, hypnotic guitar work, and a rich palette of global influences. The record is a cinematic journey that feels both timeless and forward-thinking, with each track telling its own story through melody and atmosphere. Golden Age has garnered critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its seamless fusion of styles, masterful instrumentation, and evocative song crafting.

General Admission Tickets are $26.94 per person, including fees. All tickets can be purchased in the above website link.
