# The Best Winter Activities in Marin County

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Wednesday, October 16, 2024 by MCVB Staff

By Megan Eileen McDonough

Marin County may be home to the famous [Mount Tamalpais](http://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/camping/mount-tamalpais-state-park/) and a picture-perfect [national seashore](http://www.visitmarin.org/places/experience-point-reyes) of over 80 miles, but don’t limit your trip to the spring and summer. Due to Marin’s microclimate, temperatures never drop too low, so all you need is a warm sweater and coat. Plus, many of Marin’s top attractions aren’t as crowded in the winter, so you’ll likely have a more personalized and intimate experience. Here are five activities to keep you warm and full of wonder this winter.

**Warm Up With a Wildlife Walk**

Just because it’s winter doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the great outdoors. Marin doesn’t get all that cold, but there’s definitely a cool chill in the air. Warm your body up with a walking tour. [Coastal Walkers](http://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/tours/walking-tours/coastal-walkers-1/) offers a few different routes that take participants to some of Marin County’s best viewpoints—the Muir Woods, Mount Tamalpais, Sausalito and Baker Beach, to name a few. Remember to wear comfortable walking shoes, as you’ll be walking on different terrain throughout, and layer up to keep warm.

**Make Time for Pastries, Espresso and Wine**

Marin County has no shortage of cute and cozy cafes to pop into throughout the day. That said, the [Petite Left Bank](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/dining/breakfast-and-brunch/petite-left-bank-1/), located in historic downtown Tiburon, is a quaint caffè, wine bar & pasticceria featuring a menu that includes high-quality pastries, cakes, coffees, sandwiches, soups, and teas. Come enjoy the waterfront view by the ferry and the new interior and expanded outdoor seating. Pull up a seat and order a puff pastry and a coffee bar drink; your body will be warmed up in no time. It’s a Caffe for everyone!

**Wine and Dine Your Way to Warm**

Sometimes the only thing you need to warm up is a hearty meal and a glass of wine. Marin’s proximity to wine country coupled with many farm-to-table restaurants means you’re in for a real treat…literally. Since 2012, [Food & Farm Tours](https://www.visitmarin.org/culinary/food-and-wine/food-farm-tours-1-1/) has been a beloved experience for Bay Area locals and out-of-towners looking to experience the bounty of Marin and Sonoma Counties through intimate culinary adventures at some of the area’s best farms and restaurants. From artisan cheese tastings complete with baby goat and sheep cuddles, to behind-the-scenes coastal oyster tours to expert-led pairing classes at breweries, wineries and distilleries, [Food & Farm Tours](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/tours/guided-tours/food-farm-tours-1/) treat guests to unique and intimate experiences.

**Get Cultured at Marin MOCA**

Even though Marin never gets too cold, winter is the perfect excuse to check out some of the county’s indoor attractions. There are a handful of museums in Marin, the Museum of Contemporary Art being among the most frequented. MOCA has both permanent and temporary exhibits, so there’s always the opportunity to get schooled in a new art form. For something a bit more interactive, sign up for an immersive art class, like the Tuesday Life Painting Group.
