# Best Bars for Football Watching in Marin

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Tuesday, September 2, 2025 by MCVB Staff

By Megan Eileen McDonough

[Football season is in full swing](https://www.visitmarin.org/blog/superbowl-in-marin/), so grab a barstool and order that extra pint. Football is one of the most American sports, so of course you’ll want to cheer on your favorite team. Several of Marin’s top bars cater to football fans through special promotions, featured brews and, best of all, a surplus of snacks. Here are four of Marin’s best bars for grabbing a pint.

**The Best Bar Game Watching**

Newly opened this year, [Perry’s Novato](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/dining/american-restaurants/perrys-novato/) serves up a classic American menu with a casual, and lively dining atmosphere. A bustling bar and the warmth and personality for which the restaurant has always been known have resulted in a warm, enthusiastic welcome from the local community. Perry's features options for both indoor and outdoor dining with a cozy fireplace in both areas. For game-viewing purposes, check out the large bar with three big screen TVs for watching your favorite sport while noshing on appetizers and pints of your favorite beer.

**The Best Beer Garden**

Novato’s [Hopmonk Tavern](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/nightlife/bars/hopmonk-tavern-novato/) is a popular spot for _Sunday Night Football_ , but that’s not the only thing drawing patrons through the doors. Hopmonk has a spacious beer garden decked out with a fire pit, fountains, string lights and more. By day it gives off a picnic feel, but come nightfall the space transforms into a romantic date spot or even an outdoor concert hall. In addition to its extensive menu of fresh beer on draft, Hopmonk also serves bottled beer—Guinness, Alaskan Amber Ale and Green Flash Imperial IPA, to name a few.

**The Best Food, Music, and Beer Pairings**

Choosing the best bar for beer and food pairings can be a tough call. But [Sweetwater Music Hall](https://sweetwatermusichall.org/events/?view=list), in Mill Valley will have you covered. Watch the SuperBowl on a high-def movie screen with friends and neighbors. Yummy farm-to-table food and drink specials all day long. Free admission, all ages welcome.

**The Best Bar for Craft Beer**

[Creekside Pizza & Taproom](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/nightlife/bars/creekside-pizza-taproom-1/) is San Anselmo's true hometown local family-owned neighborhood restaurant and gathering destination featuring award-winning artisan hand-crafted pizza, salads, sandwiches, and pasta for lunch, and dinner. 

The taproom features 40 tap handles with over 30 craft beers from more than 25 unique craft breweries, plus hard cider, kombucha, draft root beer and Creekside's own Cold Brew coffee; a thoughtful selection of craft beers with character and depth to awe even the most hardened beer enthusiast, plus outstanding local, organic and estate wines from Napa, Sonoma and Monterey wines.
