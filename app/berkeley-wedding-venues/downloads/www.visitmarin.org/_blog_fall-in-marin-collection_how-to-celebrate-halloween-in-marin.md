# How to Celebrate Halloween in Marin

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Tuesday, October 1, 2024 by MCVB Staff

We hope you’ve bought your Halloween costume because it’s almost time to trick-or-treat! Marin County has many fun happenings around Halloween time, from live entertainment and colorful parades to themed farm and pumpkin patches. Whether you’re in town for Halloween or all of October, here are six ways to celebrate the [spooky season](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2024/october-2024/)[.](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2024/october-2024/)

**Novato's Not-So-Scary Halloween Magic Show**[](/site/assets/files/8574/novatohalloween.png)

This year, join [Novato Parks and Recreation](https://www.downtownnovato.com/) for The Not-So-Scary Halloween Magic Show featuring Mike Della Penna. It's a magic show full of Halloween fun appropriate for all ages. This is a FREE event and no registration is required.   
Saturday, October 26th: To accommodate everyone, we're now offering TWO time slots—10 AM or 11:30 AM. No reservations are required, so simply pick the time that suits you best and witness the magic right before your eyes!  
The location is at the [Novato City Hall](https://www.novato.org/government/parks-recreation-community-services/events), 901 Sherman Ave.

**Fairfax Halloween Parade**

Halloween is all about costumes, so why not show yours off at this year’s [Fairfax parade](https://www.townoffairfax.org/halloween-parade/)?

Fairfax kids and parents - come one and all! -- to the annual downtown parade sponsored by the Fairfax Chamber of Commerce on October 31. Meet at the Fairfax Theatre on Broadway at 4:30 pm. The parade starts at 5 pm and goes down Broadway to Bolinas and over to the Haunted Grove in Bolinas Park. Shop owners will pass out treats and the chamber will hand out neon glow necklaces. Prizes for Best costumes will be announced at approximately 6 pm in the park for best Family costume, Best Boy's costume, Best Girl's costume, and Most Creative costume.

**Tick or Treat on Fourth Street**[](/site/assets/files/8574/trick-or-treat_downtown_sr_1280x0.png)

Enjoy a family-friendly way to celebrate Halloween in [San Rafael](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2024/october-2024/trick-or-treat-on-fourth-street/) with an extra surprise this year of a Pet Costume Contest!  
Fourth Street merchants will be welcoming kids and families on Saturday, October 26th from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm. Dress up, bring a bag and get ready for some treats! (or tricks). Look for the "Participating Businesses" sign in the window for some treats! Enjoy spooky live music performed by the Marin Girls Chorus in the plaza from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm! Details about the Pet Costume Contest are coming soon! 

**Halloween Bash at Rancho Nicasio**

El Radio Fantastique is a band that hails from Point Reyes Station and is led by its founder, Giovanni Di Morente. Channeling disparate past experiences as a grave digger, dumpster diver, and pop star (of the 80s band Times Two), DiMorente fancies the broken and the crooked, and he celebrates them with sublime melody and passion. El Radio Fantastique is the band that would be playing at Salvadore Dali's birthday party! Di Morente and the other members have bonds that go back to childhood. This deep connection manifests itself in their sound and in the familiar spell they cast onstage. Saturday, October 26th, for dinner from 6:00pm to 8:00 with music beginning at 7:30 at [Rancho Nicasio](https://www.ranchonicasio.com/music.htm).
