# An Autumn Day on The Bay

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Wednesday, September 3, 2025 by MCVB Staff

What would you do if you had just a single day to explore Marin County? From sailing excursions and breathtaking hikes to charming stays in waterfront hotels and delectable farm-to-table dining, Marin offers an unparalleled experience for any visitor.

### 

### 

### Morning: Start the Day by Setting Sail

Imagine starting your day by gliding across the sparkling waters of San Francisco Bay, with the majestic Golden Gate Bridge and rugged Marin Headlands as your backdrop. Whether you choose a private charter or join a group tour, sailing offers a unique perspective of the bay’s natural beauty. Consider booking a trip with [SF Bay Adventures](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/tours/water-sport-tours/sf-bay-adventures-schooner-freda-b/) onboard The Schooner Freda B for a classic sailing experience that captures the essence of Marin’s maritime allure. Freda B is an 80’ coastal schooner available for private rental and public sails and can carry up to 49 guests.   
If you’re up for more adventure, head on a [wildlife tour on The Tamalpais](https://tamalpaischarters.com/events-2/). This 90-minute cruise requires reservations, so book early to see marine mammals like whales, seals, porpoises, jellyfish, and birds!

### Midday: Photo-Op of You and The Bay

After breakfast (or your sail—whichever you do first), venture into the Marin Headlands for a hike amid awe-inspiring landscapes—you would’ve caught a glimpse of the area from your morning sail adventure. The Headlands boast numerous trails that offer panoramic views of the bay and Pacific Ocean. Popular trails include the Coastal Trail and the Rodeo Valley Trail, each providing a unique perspective of the region’s natural beauty. Don’t forget to bring a camera to capture the breathtaking vistas!

If you’re not much of a hiker but still want to check out the area, you can walk or drive up to the Battery Spencer overlook for a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge from above. At almost 500 feet above the bay, this high clifftop vantage point makes for great views or a fantastic place to propose.

####

#### Angel Island Adventure

After you’re finished at the Headlands, you can take the [Angel Island Tiburon Ferry](https://www.visitmarin.org/outdoor-activities/the-bay-and-protected-open-space/angel-island-tiburon-ferry-1-1/) from downtown Tiburon directly to [Angel Island](https://angelisland.org/to-do/). This paradise island has so much to offer; from [hiking Mount Livermore](https://www.visitmarin.org/outdoor-activities/hiking/angel-island-state-park/) to biking around the Perimeter Road, you can see everything from wildflowers to whales.

#### Bayview Lunch Options in Tiburon

Once you’re done exploring the island, you have a few options for lunch. If you brought your lunch, have a picnic at Ayala Cove. It’s just a short walk from the ferry dock and has BBQs and picnic tables available on a first-come, first-served basis.

Not much of a picnicker? Get back on the ferry and head into Tiburon. Once you get off the ferry, you’re nice and close to a multitude of options. [The Petite Left Bank](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/dining/breakfast-and-brunch/petite-left-bank-1/) is perfect for a weekend after-sail brunch offering traditional French fare. Another recommendation is [Sam’s Anchor Cafe](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/dining/california-coastal/sams-anchor-cafe/), which reviews say is one of the best spots for lunch in Tiburon; get a few of their share plates for the table or indulge in some tasty local seafood.

### The Seasonal Star on The Bay: Fleet Week (October 10–12th, 2025)

Fleet Week, held annually from October 10th to 12th, offers a unique opportunity to blend your Marin adventures with exciting festivities that honor the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. This weeklong event features a variety of activities and displays you can check out on their website, making it a perfect complement to your day on the bay. The highlight is the [Blue Angels’](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2025/october-2025/fleet-week-air-show-in-san-francisco-october-10-12-2025/) breathtaking aerial performance, which includes the only airshow featuring a commercial airliner. For the best views, head to the waterfront, where you can watch the show unfold against the stunning backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge.

From sailing the bay and hiking scenic trails to exploring charming towns and savoring local cuisine, Marin County offers an array of experiences that make for a perfect day out. For the best places to stay in Marin, visit the Marin CVB at [visitmarin.org/hotels](http://visitmarin.org/hotels).
