# Freda Payne: Valetines is for Lovers

**Date** : Saturday, February 14, 2026

**Time** : 7:30pm

[**Website**](https://www.marinjazz.com/upcoming-events/freda-payne;-valetines-)

**Co-Presented by Marin Jazz and the Lark Theater!**

**Freda Payne** is best known for her 1970 hit from Invictus Records, "Band of Gold," written by the founders of Invictus, the famed Motown hit team, Holland-Dozier-Holland (Lamont Dozier and brothers Brian and Eddie Holland). 

But she began her career as a jazz singer in the early to mid-1960s. One of her biggest influences during that time was one of jazz's greatest vocalists, Ella Fitzgerald. Payne references other inspirations, but claims "Ella was the one I felt most attached to." So it's fitting that some 60 years later, 

**Payne pays tribute to the greats, Ella Fitzgerald, Nina Simone, Carmen McRae and many more.**

Payne is a delightful storyteller, cluing us in on Ella's early forays on the stage–including her appearance at the Apollo Theater's amateur night, where she had intended to dance, but ended up singing and winning that night–and being discovered by big band leader Chick Webb, the night was mostly about the songs Ella sang. With an uber-tight trio of musicians (Larry Dunlap; bassist Gary Brown; and drummer Leon Joyce, Jr.) are on board to keep the mood swinging from start to finish. Quote by Patrick Thomas 

Payne's love for the Queens of Jazz is evident in every moment of her performance. 

**Larry Dunlap**

Pianist, composer and arranger Larry Dunlap has a multifaceted career that includes extensive work in the fields of jazz, classical and popular music. Since the early 1980s Larry has been pianist in North America with the British singer Dame Cleo Laine and her musician husband Sir John Dankworth. His past work has seen him appearing and/or recording with jazz vocalists Mark Murphy, Sheila Jordan, Ernestine Anderson and Joe Williams as well as instrumentalists Gerry Mulligan, Art Farmer, Ralph Towner, Ernie Watts, Bud Shank and Larry Coryell, to name a few.

In the pop music field Larry has toured with The Pointer Sisters, Country Joe McDonald, and others. 

**Ticket Price: $70 General Admission and $85 VIP. Please visit the website posted above for more information.**
