# Celebrate Pride Month in Downtown San Rafael

**Date** : Tuesday, June 10, 2025

**Time** : June 1 - 30, 2025

Celebrating LGBTQ Pride Month in Downtown San Rafael! 

Get ready for a month-long celebration of Pride, art, and discovery this June! Join the Downtown Business Improvement District for the inaugural Pride Art Walk in Downtown San Rafael, where a colorful array of decorated businesses awaits.

Throughout the entire month, stroll through Downtown San Rafael and enjoy the imaginative windows, each a tribute to LGBTQ Pride Month. But here's the twist: hidden in each display is a special colored #PRIDE to discover!

Match the #PRIDE's color to the corresponding business on your map as you go. As you embark on this quest, you can learn what each color in the Pride flag means. Once you've completed your Downtown Rainbow journey, turn in your map for a chance to win fabulous prizes, including tickets to the CA Film Institute (see below for show times and discounts for the Pride Series) and California Cowboy Limited Edition Pride Shirts.

Whether you're an art enthusiast, a lover of community events, or simply looking for a new adventure, the Pride Art Walk promises a colorful experience for all.

Please visit the above website link to view participating businesses, a map and other special offers.
