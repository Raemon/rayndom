# Last-Minute Memorial Day Weekend Guide to Marin County

Posted Tuesday, April 1, 2025 by MCVB Staff

By Joe Kukura

The unofficial start of summer is almost here, and Marin County, the “sunny side of the Golden Gate Bridge,” shines as a great getaway for your Memorial Day weekend enjoyment. Perfectly placed right between San Francisco and California wine country, Marin County offers a long list of holiday weekend attractions, with outstanding [outdoor activities](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/), eclectic [shopping options](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/), and an unbeatable [nightlife scene](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/nightlife/) that gave birth to legends like the Grateful Dead and Metallica.

Memorial Day weekend is a terrific time to take in the stunning sights and community charm of Marin County. You’ll love the famous range of [restaurants](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/restaurants/). And the [places to stay](https://www.visitmarin.org/hotels/) feature distinctive [boutique hotels](https://www.visitmarin.org/hotels/boutique/), [bed-and-breakfasts](https://www.visitmarin.org/hotels/bed-breakfast/), and [coastal lodging](https://www.visitmarin.org/hotels/point-reyes/) along the Pacific Ocean or Marin’s famed bays. There are also a few special activities and attractions lined up for the holiday weekend to make this Memorial Day one you’ll never forget.

**Outdoor Adventures**

[Kayaking in Marin County](https://www.visitmarin.org/outdoor-activities/kayaking/) is a fantastic option for any weekend of the year. But on Saturday and Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, the folks at [Blue Waters Kayaking](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/kayaking/blue-waters-kayaking/) have a special [Tomales Point Exploration](https://www.bluewaterskayaking.com/calendar/)[ ](https://www.bluewaterskayaking.com/calendar/)planned on the wilderness and water wonderland of the [Point Reyes National Seashore](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/beaches-in-marin-county/point-reyes-national-seashore/).

Blue Waters Kayaking guides will plan the itinerary for your Tomales Point four-hour tour. Launching from Miller Park Boat Ramp (next to the restaurant at Nick’s Cove) closed-deck double kayaks are provided for your paddle through the tide channels to the remote beaches of the Peninsula. Exploring the Point Reyes National Seashore, you will discover the diverse animals that inhabit the Bay and its shores. In addition to the Tule Elk, it is common to see harbor seals, bat rays, leopard sharks, osprey, river otters, and sea lions! The area around Hog Island is rich in wildlife and scenic beauty. Over 400 Tule Elk inhabit the northern part of the peninsula and can be seen from the kayaks.

If you prefer your outdoor adventures on land, [hiking in Marin County](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/hiking/) reaches new heights this time of year, with the [spring wildflowers in full bloom](https://www.visitmarin.org/blog/the-best-spring-wildflower-walks-in-marin-county/) and [guided hikes](https://www.visitmarin.org/blog/marin-countys-best-hiking-tours-await/) that let you see the season’s visiting whales and seals.

What kind of hike do you like? If you flock to bird watching or wildlife, the [Hamilton Wetlands](https://natureinnovato.com/2018/01/23/hamilton-wetlands/) is home to countless species of waterbirds, land birds, reptiles and more.

Fantastic photo opportunities await at the [Point Bonita Lighthouse](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/hiking/point-bonita-lighthouse/), a secret gem of the San Francisco Bay Area.

World-famous views of the Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge await at the [Marin Headlands](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/hiking/marin-headlands/). And for a panoramic mountain view that you just can’t beat, [Mount Tamalpais State Park](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/hiking/mount-tamalpais-state-park/) majestically stands tall over Marin County. 

**Family Fun**

[Stafford Lake Bike Park](https://www.parks.marincounty.org/parkspreserves/parks/stafford-lake-bike-park) is a scenic, fun, and challenging course for bikers at all levels. The 17-acre terrain features the only dual slalom course west of Truckee as well as beautiful views of Stafford Lake and is North Bay’s first public bike park. The park also includes a kid's learn-to-ride zone pump track, beginner zone pump track, skills perimeter trail, dual slalom gravity zone, and progression jumping course.

Horseback riding for youngsters six years old and under who haven’t reached the minimum age to go on an adult trail ride can opt in for a fun 20-minute pony ride at [Five Brooks Ranch](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/horseback-riding/). The gentlest horses and ponies will take your young Buckaroos and Buckarettes on a hand-led ride around the Mill Pond where they may see a variety of wildlife, such as the Black Tail deer or the Great Blue Heron.

Kick off your summer with an unforgettable weekend in Marin County, where the sun, style, and scenery really stand out.
