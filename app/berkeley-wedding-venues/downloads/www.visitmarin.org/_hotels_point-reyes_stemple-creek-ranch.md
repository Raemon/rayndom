**Stemple Creek Ranch**  
900 Burbank Lane  
Tomales, CA 94971

[www.stemplecreek.com](https://stemplecreek.com/pages/ranch-stays?srsltid=AfmBOor9bErlxLoCRL4cE2Pn1lIiNfPJE9iJU_iJri89TgJPiCLt2pSn)

Stemple Creek Ranch in Tomales has two cottages and two farmhouses available for a quite getaway or group gathering, sleeping up to 22 guests onsite. Our accommodations blend rustic elegance into a backdrop of country charm. We have a cute, studio cottage with an outdoor shower (the Writer's Cottage), a cabin with a private deck and cozy sleeping loft (the Cabin aka The Love Shack), a two bedroom house with a private garden and covered patio (the Schoolhouse), and a newly restored 150-year old farmhouse with 4 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, and a huge chef's kitchen, dining room, and great outdoor entertaining space (Zia's Farmhouse). The Schoolhouse and Zia's Farmhouse have full kitchens and the Writer's Cottage and The Cabin have kitchenettes, making each the perfect location for a family getaway. 

Stemple Creek Ranch is just a few miles from the ocean and less than one mile from Shoreline Highway (Highway 1), making it a great home base for both Marin and Sonoma County-based activities.

Perfect for weekend getaways, retreats, events and large private gatherings.
