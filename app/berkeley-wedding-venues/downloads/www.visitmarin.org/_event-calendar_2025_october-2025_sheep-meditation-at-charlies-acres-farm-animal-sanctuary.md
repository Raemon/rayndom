# Sheep Meditation at Charlie's Acres Farm Animal Sanctuary

**Date** : Sunday, October 19, 2025

**Time** : 10:00am

[**Website**](https://www.charliesacres.org/visit/)

You may have heard of goat yoga, but we're slowing it down a bit and relaxing with sheep meditation. Enjoy the sounds of nature and crystal singing bowls as you sit with the rescued sheep residents of Charlie's Acres Farm Animal Sanctuary. Tickets are $63.60 per person and must be booked in the above website link. 

### About the Instructors:

Bob and Amelia have been on the spiritual path for 14 years together, searching for tools to help ease and harmonize the awakening of others. These Sonoma locals offer a variety of wellness services through their company Paradigm Shift.

### Sheep Residents:

Many of the animals who now call Charlie's Acres home were rescued from situations of abuse or neglect and are in the process of healing. Meditation with rescued animals can be beneficial not only to the humans participating but is also a great opportunity for animals who are wary of humans to experience a safe, calm, positive, and healing interaction. As a non-profit farm animal sanctuary, our priority is the physical and emotional well-being of the rescued animals who call Charlie's Acres home. Our animal residents always have a choice as to whether or not they want to interact with visitors. Every class will be different and dependent on how our sheep decide to participate.

### Details:

  * We'll provide yoga mats. Please bring comfortable clothes and a water bottle. Ages 14+
  * Please arrive 10-15 min early to check-in, set up, and get acquainted with our rescued animal residents.
  * In the event of inclement weather, Sheep Meditation will be rescheduled.
