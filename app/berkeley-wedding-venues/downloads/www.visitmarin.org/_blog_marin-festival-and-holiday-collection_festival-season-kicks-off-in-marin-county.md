# Festival Season Kicks Off in Marin County

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Tuesday, August 5, 2025 by MCVB Staff

By Megan Eileen McDonough

Festival season is on the horizon, and we’ve rounded up seven of our favorites. From beer and wine to crafts and film, there’s something for every interest in Marin. While there are certainly festivals taking place year-round, the most highly anticipated events kick off in early June and wind down in late October.

**1\. Mill Valley Music Fest -**_May_

The inaugural [Mill Valley Music Festival ](https://www.millvalleymusicfest.com/)is a one-day outdoor arts and culture event presented by the Mill Valley Chamber of Commerce. It features a heady, multi-genre mix of diverse national acts and local lights, coupled with world-class food, drink and art for your best friends and ones you’re yet to meet. This all-ages gathering, happening from Noon to 7pm, embraces the Bay Area’s rich diversity with eyes, ears and arms wide open. Arts and culture have been long-lived deep in the bones of our community. Let’s all celebrate it!

**2\. Novato Festival of Art, Wine, and Music -**_June_

Join us for two days of music on five stages with wine tastings and art on Grant Avenue between Redwood and Seventh. [Events](https://www.novatochamber.com/2022-art-wine-music/) take place beginning at 11:00am and continue until 6:00pm on both days.

**3\. Marin County Fair -**_June/July_

Plans are underway for the [Marin County Fair](https://marinfair.org/), an outdoor-only event with a different theme each year! Pre-Sale tickets are currently $20 each and will be $25 at the gate when the fair starts. All Fair Tickets include general admission to the headline concerts (seating is first-come, first served), which will be announced in May! See you at the Fair!

**4\. Corte Madera Fourth of July Festival -**_July_

Looking to spice up your July 4 weekend? Head to Corte Madera’s Fourth of July Parade & Festival. The parade kicks off at 10:30 a.m. at Redwood High School in Larkspur and winds down at the [Corte Madera Town Center](http://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/shopping-centers/town-center-corte-madera/). Come ready to dance, as the Famous Corte Madera Town Band, the Freedom Band and the Macintosh Pipe Band will be playing tunes throughout. Choose among a variety of entertainment, from arts and crafts and delicious local eats to musical performances and children's activities.

**5\. San Anselmo Art & Wine Festival - ** _July_

This year marks the 33rd annual [San Anselmo Art & Wine Festival.](https://www.facebook.com/San-Anselmo-Art-Wine-Festival-133811209983079/) Taking place Saturday and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., the free festival is a one-stop shop for all things art. While the festival itself is free of charge, a pack of wine sampling tickets is an additional cost. Early-bird prices give you 10 sampling tickets for $15 ($20 cash, day of). Surrounded by hills, great views and a flowing creek, [San Anselmo](http://www.visitmarin.org/places/san-anselmo/) is the perfect spot for a cool glass of wine.

**6\. Mill Valley Fall Arts Festival -**_September_

Only a few more months until the [Mill Valley Fall Arts Festival](http://www.mvfaf.org/) comes to town and they will be celebrating 60 years. This September, festival goers will get to experience the region's best artwork in quite the magical setting—the redwoods at the foot of [Mount Tamalpais](http://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/hiking/mount-tamalpais-state-park/). General admission is $10 for adults, $5 for students and senior citizens, and free for kids 12 and under. The exhibitor list is not yet finalized, but expect to see a variety of mediums, from photography and printmaking to woodwork and glass.

**7\. Mill Valley Film Festival -**_October_

Calling all movie buffs! The [Mill Valley Film Festival](https://www.mvff.com/) (MVFF) is in town and, in true tradition, will showcase a buzzworthy collection of internationally acclaimed films. Depending on your interest and budget, there are a few advanced ticket options: the Opening Night Package for $225, the Closing Night Package for $150 or the Movie 12-Pack for $169 (all non-member prices).

**8\. Oktoberfest Corte Madera -**_October_

If you can't celebrate Oktoberfest in Germany, [Corte Madera](https://www.facebook.com/OktoberfestCM/?locale=es_LA) might just be the next best place. For more than 20 years running, the town has been hosting its very own Oktoberfest, with an impressive collection of local craft beer to boot! Based on previous years, tasting tickets will cost $25 and include a commemorative glass mug. Not a beer drinker? Stick to wines instead. Since Corte Madera is home to some of the region's best wineries and vineyards, there will be plenty to choose from.
