# The Best Easter Celebrations in Marin County

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Wednesday, March 12, 2025 by MCVB Staff

By Megan Eileen McDonough

Easter’s almost here and it's time to start rounding up our favorite brunches, hunts and special events. Springtime in Marin is always a beautiful time to connect with nature, and come Easter, that’s especially true. Whether you're hoping to snap a selfie with the Easter Bunny or hunt for eco-friendly eggs, here are some of Marin's most highly anticipated Easter events. Get your baskets ready!

**Sunday Easter Brunches**

_Instead of snacking all day on chocolate eggs, book a table at one of Marin County's best restaurants and indulge in a hearty but healthy brunch._

[The Range Cafe](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/dining/american-restaurants/range-cafe-bar-and-grill-at-peacock-gap-golf-club/) at Peacock Gap in San Rafael on Sunday will once again host an Easter brunch with seatings at 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon for families and friends. The buffet menu this year looks delicious: seasonal fresh fruit and freshly baked scones and muffins with whipped butter and housemade preserves are just one of the many dishes. Best of all, there's a special visit from the Easter Bunny himself from 9:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. with an egg hunt on the lawn - please bring your own baskets! 

Rancho Nicasio's Annual Easter Sunday Buffet will be complete with its own [Ranch Style BBQ](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2025/april-2025/celebrate-easter-sunday-bbq-brunch-at-rancho-nicasio/) menu to delight all ages from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.! Reservations are recommended~

The [Left Bank Brasserie](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/dining/farm-to-table/left-bank-brasserie-2/) in downtown Larkspur, the [Farmshop](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/dining/farm-to-table/farmshop-in-larkspur/) at Larkspur's Country Mart, and [Il Davide](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/dining/farm-to-table/il-davide-1/) in San Rafael all serve up delicious weekend brunches to satisfy the most discerning palate.

The options don't end there. The [RH Rooftop Restaurant](https://rh.com/us/en/marin/restaurant) at the Village Corte Madera will please the eye with crystal chandeliers, a romantic setting, and fantastic views with indoor/outdoor seatings. Brunch features an ingredient-driven menu and a selection of artisanal wines and craft beer. Enjoy Easter here with a special someone! 

**Easter Egg Hunts and Springtime Selfies**

_There’s no shortage of Easter egg hunts in Marin County, so take your pick!_

Pre-Easter, the action is just getting started on March 29th with the Mill Valley Community Center hosting its [2025 Spring Faire](https://www.millvalleyrecreation.org/830/Spring-Faire)[.](https://www.millvalleyrecreation.org/830/Spring-Eggstravaganza) Join the Easter Bunny at Friends Field for the annual egg hunt along with games, activities, crafts, a toddler zone, bounce houses, food vendors, and more.

In the Corte Madera/Larkspur area, stop by [Marin Country Mart](https://marincountrymart.com/events) Farmers Market on Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. for an Easter celebration and egg hunt. . The egg hunt starts at 10:30 a.m. for ages 3 and under and at 10:45 a.m. for ages 4 and up. There will be a visiting Easter Bunny for those photo opts. Children should arrive with their own baskets to participate in the eco-friendly egg hunt. Come early for a peek at the baby chicks and bunnies. Grownups, toast to a day well played at the mimosa bar.

Hop over to the [Corte Madera Town Park](https://www.cortemadera.gov/DocumentCenter/View/10040/spring25-web-Full-Guide) for an Easter celebration on Saturday, April 19th at 10:00am and meet the Easter Bunny after the egg hunt. Put on floppy Bunny ears and pose for a memorable photo. 

**Flashlight Egg Hunts**

_Bring a flashlight! You’ll need it._

On Friday, April 18th, [San Anselmo](https://www.townofsananselmo.org/398/Egg-Hunt) and the [Twin Cities](https://www.cortemadera.gov/DocumentCenter/View/10040/spring25-web-Full-Guide) of Corte Madera and Larkspur again host the yearly Flashlight Egg Hunt in Memorial and Piper Parks. Bring a basket and a flashlight because this nighttime hunt will be unlike any other! The hunts begin at 8:00 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. sharp respectively, and only last for about ten minutes, so this is not the event to roll up late to! Ideal for kids 8 years and up.

Bunny will be busy all day in April, so don't miss him as he hops all around Marin County!
