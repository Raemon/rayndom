# Romance in Marin County: Find Your Perfect Valentine’s Day Getaway

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Friday, January 24, 2025 by MCVB Staff

By Whitney Butler

The holidays can be taxing, and sometimes New Year’s resolutions incite more anxiety than change. This year, why not focus on what really matters? Valentine’s Day is just around the corner, so ignite some romance with a couple’s retreat to Marin County.

Here are a few tips to help get your Valentine’s Day romantic getaway underway:

**Where to Stay**

Tucked away in a beautiful redwood forest, the perfect retreat is waiting for you and yours at the [Mill Valley Inn](http://www.visitmarin.org/hotels/boutique/mill-valley-inn/). Located a short walk away from downtown Mill Valley, this intimate hotel rests at the foot of Mount Tamalpais, where visitors can enjoy hiking, biking and other outdoor recreational activities.

[The Lodge at Marconi](https://www.visitmarin.org/hotels/point-reyes/lodge-at-marconi/) offers a peaceful retreat, inviting guests to relax and disconnect from the outside world. Staying true to its mission of creating a calm and rejuvenating environment, the lodge has intentionally excluded televisions from its rooms. Here, guests can truly unwind and embrace a break from digital distractions. Your stay promises a chance to immerse yourself in tranquility, surrounded by the serene ambiance of West Marin. Let the soothing sounds of nature enhance your romantic getaway and leave you feeling refreshed.

[The Mountain Hom](https://www.visitmarin.org/hoteloffersandpackages/?view=1&offerid=15796)e Inn is another rustic and romantic choice for couples interested in intimate accommodations. Perched high above the San Francisco Bay on Mt. Tamalpais, the inn offers breathtaking views of the bay's clear, blue waters and the soft mist of fog covering the hills and homes below. From here, you can savor the cool, tranquil mountain air as you rest. This is more than just a getaway—it's a retreat where you can set aside the cares of the world. A place where nature’s beauty is paired with homemade lemonade, cozy log fires. The inn features ten charming rustic guestrooms, a sunlit terrace, a full-service restaurant, a cozy gathering room, and a bar offering carefully selected regional wines and beers.

For a very different experience, the [AC Hotel](https://www.visitmarin.org/hotels/hotels-listings/ac-hotel-san-rafael/) in San Rafael is one of Marin's newest hotels. Plan to experience [Above Fifth](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/sfoar-ac-hotel-san-rafael/dining/) on the rooftop for seasonal food and beverages (weather pending) to take in a bird's eye view of downtown San Rafael. Enjoy the day shopping along Fourth Street or visit any number of the sidewalk cafes and restaurants that are open. Be sure to plan your stay with the [Romantic Getaway Package](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/sfoar-ac-hotel-san-rafael-downtown/overview/) being offered from February 1st through the 29th. 

**What to Eat and Drink**

When it comes to romance, one thing is for certain — it should always include good food and drink. The farm-to-table scene is strong in Marin County, celebrating a mindful and intimate approach to food that reflects local products and global lifestyles. 

At the [Heidrun Meadery](https://www.visitmarin.org/culinary/food-and-wine/heidrun-meadery-1-1/), also located in Point Reyes Station, couples can explore the picturesque farmlands where naturally sparkling meads are produced using a traditional French technique called méthode champenoise. Enjoy a tasting or pack a picnic and enjoy a bottle al fresco.

If meads don’t get you excited, other native varietals at [Trek Winery](http://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/food-and-wine/trek-winery-1-1/) in downtown Novato certainly will. Enjoy the casual tasting room while sampling award-winning wines like the 2010 Dry Creek Valley Syrah. This family-owned winery is a great place to warm up with local wines and live entertainment scheduled almost every night of the week. Check the schedule for details about live music and comedy performances.

**What to Do**

While in Marin County, be sure to stop by [Art Works Downtown](http://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/arts-entertainment-cultural/art-works-downtown/) in San Rafael for an inspired (and romantic) look at local works in mediums of all kinds. In addition to several storefronts, enjoy collections inside one of several galleries open to the public Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Sometimes igniting romance is as simple as a change of perspective. [Angel Island Tiburon Ferry](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/tours/chartered-tours/angel-island-tiburon-ferry/) offers Marin County visitors a chance to get out on the water for bay cruises. Bring your own picnic lunch or dinner and plan a day enjoying [Angel Island State Park](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/landmarks/angel-island-state-park/), or enjoy a different view of Marin County on one of their seasonal and event bay cruises.

Couples interested in learning more about locally produced wine, cheese, meats or produce should definitely consider booking a [West Marin Food & Farm Tour](http://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/tours/farm-tours/west-marin-food-farm-tours/). This customizable food experience offers a behind-the-scenes look at some of the best of West Marin’s food purveyors while providing tidbits on local culture and history.

Before you leave Marin County, make sure to enjoy the breathtaking natural beauty at one of many nearby national parks. Hike to the romantic views overlooking [Point Reyes Lighthouse](http://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/historical-and-museums/point-reyes-lighthouse/), or bike a mountain trail at [Mount Tamalpais State Park](http://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/hiking/mount-tamalpais-state-park/). Getting your heart pumping while enjoying Marin’s natural wonders is a great way to gear up for a new year of romance.
