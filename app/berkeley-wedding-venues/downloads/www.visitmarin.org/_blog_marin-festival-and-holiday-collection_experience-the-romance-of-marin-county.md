# Experience the Romance of Marin County

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Wednesday, January 1, 2025 by MCVB Staff

By Megan Eileen McDonough

While the holidays are a great time to reconnect with friends and family, don’t forget to pay extra attention to your special someone. With Valentine’s Day around the corner, now is the best time to start planning that [romantic Marin getaway](https://visitmarin.org/blog/valentines-day-in-marin/). Here are a few tips for making the most of your stay. 

**Romantic Hotels**

For a bit of rest and relaxation mixed with outdoor adventure, book a stay at [Mill Valley Inn](https://visitmarin.org/hotels/boutique/mill-valley-inn/). The hotel is a short walk from downtown Mill Valley, with boutiques, restaurants and art galleries mere minutes away. That said, the hotel has a quiet, almost remote feel to it, with European sophistication mixed with the charm of a historic mill town. Best of all, it’s located at the foot of Mount Tamalpais and a gateway to soft adventures.

If you’re seeking a private, bed-and-breakfast experience, book a few nights at [AppleGarden Cottage](https://visitmarin.org/hotels/point-reyes/applegarden-cottage/). Located just outside the historic town of Tomales, the cottage has all the modern conveniences we’re used to and is fairly spacious, with a private kitchen included. Best of all, the cottage rests on a farm known for its best-selling ciders. Guests are even greeted with a bottle and a cheese plate.

A [Deluxe Romance Package](https://www.mtnhomeinn.com/stay/#) awaits you at the Mountain Home Inn. If you are searching for a romantic getaway, look no further than an inn on top of Marin’s Mt. Tamalpais. Make one call and all the arrangements will be made to ensure a memorable night of peace, serenity and romance. Stay any night at the Inn and there will be a dozen roses and card for your sweetheart along with more delightful surprises..

**Feasts for Two**

Marin’s culinary scene is very focused on farm-to-table fare, with restaurants like [Piazza D'Angelo](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/dining/italian/piazza-d-angelo-ristorante/) perfecting that craft every season. The Mill Valley hotspot has created a special San Valentino Dinner Menu to celebrate the Love Holiday. Splurge on fresh house-made pasta, wood-fired pizzas, antipasti, as well as fresh fish, prime meats, and their abundant choice of desserts.

You’re in for a wild ride at [Il Davide](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/dining/farm-to-table/il-davide-1/), so strap on your seatbelt. Il Davide is considered one of the best Italian restaurants in Marin. Owner / Chef David Haydon is the master behind the creations and is often found in the restaurant on a busy Friday or Saturday night, talking to customers, pouring port, helping seat or even bussing a table. On any romantic evening, you are ensured to be taken care of well.

Located on the town square in Nicasio, [Rancho Nicasio](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/dining/california-cuisine-restaurants/rancho-nicasio-restaurant-bar/) offers rustic ambiance, California cuisine, and LIVE music! Get ready for a romantic [Valentine's Day Night](https://www.ranchonicasio.com/music.htm) filled with stirring French Gypsy Jazz, and Romantic American Standards by Le Jazz Hot Quartet. Bandjango plays with global rhythms that famously inspire dancing, and the dance floor will be open! Reserve your table and purchase [tickets](https://ci.ovationtix.com/35892) for this magical gypsy jazz Valentine's treat!

**Couples’ Activities**

Get inspired by a night of gallery hopping as part of San Rafael’s [Art Works Downtown](https://visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/art-studios-and-galleries/art-works-downtown-inc/). The galleries are open to the public Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., but on every second Friday of the month (5 p.m. to 8 p.m.) the spaces stay open after hours for an evening of art admiration, wine and live music. Mix and mingle with fellow art lovers and maybe even meet one of the featured artists! Afterward, wander over to one of the many local restaurants.

I left my heart in San Francisco and boarded a Schooner in Sausalito! For a romantic outing on the water with some of the most iconic and breathtaking views in California, The [Freda B](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/tours/guided-tours/sf-bay-adventures-schooner-freda-b-1/) offers a unique Sunset and Bay Lights sail to all lovers and friends on February 14th. Step aboard this classic schooner and enjoy a magical trip back in time. Snuggle up or spend time with your BFF as we sail into the sunset. [Angel Island Tiburon Ferry](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/tours/chartered-tours/angel-island-tiburon-ferry/), Marin's only family-owned and operated ferry service, invites you and your loved one onboard The Tamalpais while the sun sets over San Francisco Bay for their [Valentine's Day Sunset Cruise](https://angelislandferry.com/bay-cruises/#b1)! Enjoy the breath-taking views of the bay while enjoying complimentary light appetizers and a glass of bubbly (age 21+). 

Up for a road trip? Take a scenic drive along the [Sonoma Marin Cheese Trail](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/culinary/foodie-resourcees/sonoma-marin-cheese-trail-map/). Either follow the suggested route or carve out your own itinerary. Remember to plan ahead, as several of the cheese farms are appointment-only. That said, there are plenty of farms open to the public, no reservation needed. Swing by Bohemian Creamery to meet some of Lisa Gottreich’s Alpine dairy goats or stop at Bravo Farms for some fresh cheddar.

**Bonus Idea**

When you’re all wined out, head to [Heidrun Meadery](https://www.visitmarin.org/culinary/food-and-wine/heidrun-meadery-1-1/), a facility that creates naturally sparkling varietal meads using the traditional French méthode champenoise. The tasting room is open every day from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. (5 p.m. on weekends). The meadery also offers hour-long tours for small groups and couples, booked in advance. Before leaving, enjoy a glass of mead on the outdoor patio or pack a picnic.
