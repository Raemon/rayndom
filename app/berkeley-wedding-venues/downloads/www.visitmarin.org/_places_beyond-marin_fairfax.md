# Fairfax

Nestled in forested hills just sixteen miles north of San Francisco, a visit to Fairfax is like a breath of fresh air. You’ll find miles of unspoiled open space, thriving independent shops, restaurants and music venues, and a community that prides itself on retaining its quirky, small-town atmosphere.

The genial, sunny climate makes outdoor activities here a natural choice, and you can explore the area on foot, horse, or bicycle. It’s no coincidence that Fairfax is home to the Marin Museum of Bicycling, a friendly bike culture–center right downtown. Here you can check out the [Mountain Bike Hall of Fame](https://mmbhof.org/), smack dab in the area where the sport was invented back in the ’60s.

At night, live music is everywhere. Many world-renowned musicians call Fairfax home, and on any given night, you’ll find local and national touring acts jamming in a relaxed, at-home environment. There’s something for every visitor to enjoy in crunchy, laid-back Fairfax.
