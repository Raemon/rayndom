 _**A Favorite Destination for Visitors and Cheese Lovers from Around the World**_

Each year visitors from all over the world come to Marin French Cheese to learn how artisan cheese is made and sample the award-winning cheeses handmade in “the Cheese Factory” since 1865. Sample our many styles of cheese and browse in our retail shop for cheese to take home. Visitors love our lush grounds for weddings, team meetings, barbecues, parties and relaxing picnics by the pond. Located at the gateway to West Marin as well as the Sonoma & Napa Valley wine regions, Marin French is a perfect gathering spot for cyclists and plein-air painters. Rain or shine, we have covered picnic tables, cold beverages (wine & beer), hot chocolate, coffee, soup and assorted sandwiches available in the deli.

**Store hours: Open 9:00 am to 5:00 pm seven days per week.  
Closed on these Holidays: New Years day, Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas day.**
