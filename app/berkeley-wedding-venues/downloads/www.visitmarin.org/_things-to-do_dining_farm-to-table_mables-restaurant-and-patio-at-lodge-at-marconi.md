Mable’s, the vibrant new dining concept in Northern California’s captivating Lodge at Marconi has opened along Highway Route 1 within Marconi State Historic Park has recently opened. Managed by Oliver Hospitality and helmed by Executive Chef Les Goodman, Mable’s offers a distinctive Mediterranean-inspired menu, featuring ingredients sourced from the lush bounty of the region, a striking full bar with a robust beverage program, and a 1,300-square-foot wrap-around outdoor patio overlooking the surrounding nature and shimmering waters of Tomales Bay.

Dining at Mable’s is a sensory adventure, rooted in the concept and style of fresh, Mediterranean cuisine. The experience begins with a selection of snacks, such as Sourdough Focaccia with house cultured butter with buttermilk and Hog Island sea salt or a Smoked and Tinned Fish platter served with fried saltine crackers and giardiniera. Small, shared plates include several dips and spreads such as Sprouted Hummus with Za’atar and Harissa plus items like Shuba “Under a fur coat” Salad, Grilled Kofta Meatballs, and Tahini Goddess Salad. Entrees feature Local Pasture Raised Half Chicken with aioli, spicy rocolla, pickled pearls and salsa verde, as well as seafood-forward dish, the Spanish Fish Stew (for two) with local catch, Tomales Bay mussels, manila clams, potato, tomato picada broth, and grilled focaccia, among many additional delectable dishes.

The beverage program at Mable’s features a range of California-centric wine and cocktail offerings. With four ever-changing taps of both wine and batched cocktails, guests can indulge in a range of beverage offerings all inspired by seasonality and utilizing local Northern California produce. Offering an exciting take on traditional classics, such as a Fog Negroni with Elk Fence gin, Lillet Blanc, and Suze with lemon twist, and an Amber Manhattan featuring rye, Warren pear and sweet vermouth with bitters, guests and locals alike can feel immersed in the destination while sipping at Mable’s.

**Hours of Operation:** Tuesday – Saturday 4:00pm – 9:00pm with additional meal periods coming in the New Year.
