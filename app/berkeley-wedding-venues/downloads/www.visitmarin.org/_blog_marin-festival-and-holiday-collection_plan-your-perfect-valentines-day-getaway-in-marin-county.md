# Plan Your Perfect Valentine’s Day Getaway in Marin County

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Tuesday, January 21, 2025 by MCVB Staff

**Plan Your Perfect Valentine’s Day Getaway in Marin County**

By John Egan

A box of candy and a bouquet of flowers is one way to show love for your sweetheart on Valentine’s Day. But why not break away from the every day and treat your sweetie to a romantic getaway in Marin County—the sunny side of the Golden Gate? Here are just a few extraordinary Valentine’s Day options in Marin County for activities, dining and lodging.

**_What to Do_**

**Point Reyes Lighthouse**

A dramatic oceanside setting certainly sets the mood for romance. One of the best locales to enjoy that oceanside ambiance is [Point Reyes Lighthouse](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/historical-and-museums/point-reyes-lighthouse/). The lighthouse and visitors center are open 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Friday through Monday, but they’re closed Tuesday through Thursday. So if you want to light up your Valentine’s Day, your best bet is a weekend visit.

**Muir Woods**

This national forest is populated with 295 acres of old, giant—and impressive—redwood trees. A hand-in-hand stroll through the peaceful [Muir Woods](https://visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/environmental/muir-woods-national-monument/) forest can help create the right mood for a romantic Valentine’s Day stay in Marin County. The park is open 8 a.m. to sunset every day, including holidays.

**Valentine’s Day Sail**

Nothing says romance more than a sunset cruise on San Francisco Bay. From 4:15 p.m. to 6;30 p.m. Friday, February 14th, passengers on the [Schooner Freda B](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2025/february-2025/valentines-day-sunset-cruise-on-the-san-francisco-bay-on-schooner-freda-b/) will soak up the sights, including the iconic Golden Gate Bridge and the glittering San Francisco skyline, during the annual Valentine’s Day Sail on the bay. The excursion, costing $107 a person, launches from the boat’s slip at Marin County’s Sausalito Yacht Harbor.

**The Power of Love Expressed Through Art**

Take your loved one by the hand and grab some art and culture in downtown San Rafael. The [2nd Friday Art Walk](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2025/february-2025/2nd-friday-art-walk-in-downtown-san-rafael-1/) falls on Valentine's Day this year! Explore some of the galleries, watch artists at their work, stay for a romantic dinner

**_Where to Eat_**

**The Left Bank Brasserie**

French is the language of love, and [Left Bank Brasserie](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2025/february-2025/celebrate-valentines-day-at-left-bank-brasserie-3/) in Larkspur speaks it fluently! Celebrate amour with unforgettable menus designed to awaken your inner romantic. There is a Valentine's Day-inspired 3 Course Prix Fixe dinner for $79 per person. Wine pairings, expertly hand-selected by the Wine Director and Sommelier, will also be available with each course, as well as the option to add Tsar Nikolai Caviar to any course. Comme c'est romantique!

**Rancho Nicasio**

Located on the town square in Nicasio, [Rancho Nicasio](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2025/february-2025/valentines-dinner-and-a-show-with-le-jazz-hot-quartet-at-rancho-nicasio/) offers rustic ambiance, California cuisine, and LIVE music! Get ready for a romantic [Valentine's Day Night](https://www.ranchonicasio.com/music.htm) filled with stirring French Gypsy Jazz, and Romantic American Standards by Le Jazz Hot Quartet. Bandjango plays with global rhythms that famously inspire dancing, and the dance floor will be open! Reserve your table and purchase [tickets](https://ci.ovationtix.com/35892/performance/11540946?performanceId=11540946) for this magical gypsy jazz Valentine's treat!

**Sweetheart Sushi Making Class**

Head up to [McEvoy Ranch](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2025/february-2025/sweetheart-sushi-making-class-at-mcevoy-ranch/) and indulge in a unique and romantic evening with this hands-on sushi making class led by the renowned Chef Ed Metcalfe of [Sushimotos](https://www.sushimotos.com/).

Begin your culinary adventure in our charming Upper Ranch Victorian, where you'll learn the art of crafting a beautiful and delicious sushi platter under expert guidance. Afterward, savor the fruits of your labor alongside your partner, friends, or a special someone during a delightful dinner and drinks reception in our elegant Pavilion.

**_Where to Stay_**

**Inn at Roundstone Farm**

Want to relax and unwind with your loved one? The [Inn at Roundstone Farm](https://visitmarin.org/hotels/point-reyes/inn-at-roundstone-farm/) might be the right spot for you. Located on 10 acres in the town of Olema, this bed-and-breakfast—featuring just five guestrooms—sits within the Point Reyes National Seashore. Aside from providing views of Mount Wittenberg, Olema Valley, Inverness Ridge and Tomales Bay, the property is home to horses, bullfrogs and more than 360 species of birds.

**Acqua Hotel**

Looking for a larger property for your Valentine’s Day getaway in Marin County? The [Acqua Hotel](https://visitmarin.org/hotels/boutique/acqua-hotel/) in Mill Valley might be ideal for you. According to its website, this boutique hotel “melds stylish city sophistication with the natural beauty which surrounds it.” Perched on the edge of Richardson Bay, the hotel delivers splendid views of the water and Mount Tamalpais. That soothing atmosphere extends to the sleek, Zen-like guestrooms.
