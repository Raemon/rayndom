New Monsoon (NM) is a staple of the SF Bay Area Jam scene and are veterans of the national touring circuit. The music is a unique blend of both electrric and acoustic sounds, sophisticated songcraft, and infectious grooves. The band was formed in the late 1990’s in Marin county California by co-founding members and friends from Penn State University Bo Carper (acoustic guitar and banjo, voc), and Jeff Miller (electric guitar, voc). Joined by long time friend keyboardist Phil Ferlino in 2001 the band soon began touring. Now well into its third decade, and celebrating over 25 years of making music, the band also now features the muscular rhythm section of Mark ‘Murph’ Murphy (Bass) and Dale Fanning (Drums).

The band has released several studio and live recordings including Live at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, The Sound (Produced by Michael Shrieve/Santana and Paul Kimble/Grant Lee Buffalo) and Diamonds and Clay (recorded at Bob Weir’s TRI Studios)

NM has performed at music festivals and high profile venues throughout the country including Red Rocks, Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits, The Fillmore West, and High Sierra Music Festival. They were also part of the Big Summer Classic tour sharing the stage with String Cheese Incident, Umphrey’s McGee, Michael Franti and Spearhead and Yonder Mountain String Band. Guests have included Mike Stern, Steve Kimock, Martin Fierro (Legions of Mary) and Tim Carbone (Railroad Earth).

F.A.T. Betty is a teen rock band based in Marin County, California that plays originals and high-energy covers. Their sound is a unique mixture of sophisticated rock, funk, and jazz, performing excellent renditions of songs by bands including Rush, Led Zeppelin, and Steely Dan. Winner of 2025 Teen Battle of the Bands in both Marin and San Francisco, the band has played at Haight-Ashbury Music Fest and have headlined San Anselmo’s Live on the Avenue.
