# Art in Marin

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Wednesday, March 13, 2024 by MCVB Staff

By Whitney Butler

The job of an artist is to lead by inspiration—to see the invisible, to imagine the impossible. As part of its history, culture and community, Marin County nurtures this sentiment on several fronts.

Throughout the year, visitors to Marin County can experience the inspiring inertia that continues to push the local arts scene forward to exciting and unfamiliar places. From outdoor performances and poetry to hands-on learning from the pros, however you get inspired, you can find it in Marin County.

**Marin Art History 101**

Marin is steeped in art history beginning in the early part of the 20th century when the county emerged as a popular place for landscape painters. Many artists came from San Francisco on weekends, some camping overnight, others staying on “Arks” in Corte Madera and Larkspur. At the time there were no art galleries in Marin, and so the Marin Art Association was formed, settling in various locations throughout the county. In the 1950's, the name changed to The Marin Society of Artists and has now found its home in the heart of Marin within the designated [Downtown San Rafael Cultural District](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/arts-entertainment-cultural/downtown-san-rafael-arts-district/). The Marin Society of Artists is truly a cultural asset as being both the first and oldest art organization in Marin County.

Programs and activities are varied to appeal to groups of all ages with participation in the 2nd Friday Art Walks, Marin Open Studios, and an Artist Showcase. Feel free to join a painting group, art class, or rent space for your own “pop-up” art show.

**Arts & Culture Guide to Marin**

Plan a full day or weekend packed with artistic points of interest with the assistance of MarinArts' online [Art&Culture Guide](https://www.marinarts.org/). Try starting the day with a look at the world-famous Civic Center, built by renowned architect [Frank Lloyd Wright](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/tours/walking-tours/frank-lloyd-wright-civic-center/). Other venues include the O'Hanlon Center for the Arts, [Falkirk Cultural Center](http://www.falkirkculturalcenter.org/), and [Smith Rafael Film Center](https://www.cafilm.org/). MarinArts makes it easy to discover and participate in creative and cultural events throughout our community, including arts events and educational opportunities for all ages.

**Kinky Boots!**

Marin's [Mountain Play](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/arts-entertainment-cultural/mountain-play/) returns in 2024 with a production of Kinky Boots!, based on a 2004 British film with music and lyrics by Cyndi Lauper and book by Harvey Fierstein.

This one-of-a-kind mountaintop event takes Bay Area theatre-goers of all ages to the pinnacle of musical theatre experience. The Mountain Theatre, is a 3750-stone seat, open-air venue in Mount Tamalpais State Park. It has redwood groves and oak woodlands with a spectacular view from its 2,571-foot peak.

Performances are scheduled for Sunday, May 21, May 28, June 4, June 10, June 11 and June 18. 

**See live demonstrations and discover original work**

On any weekend, [Point Reyes Open Studios Group](http://pointreyesart.com/) hosts a local exhibit of collections from West Marin’s finest sculptors, photographers, potters, painters, printmakers, and woodworkers.

Visitors can meet artists, discover original work, explore unique studio spaces and see live demonstrations of complex, craft techniques. This free event is self-guided so you can meander at your leisure while surrounded by gardens and sweeping views of Tomales Bay.

Marin County has a bit of inspiration for everyone. Feed your creative spirit in Marin County.
