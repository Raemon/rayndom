# Exploring Marin's Cultural Resources

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Tuesday, June 4, 2024 by MCVB Staff

Most people don’t know this—unless you’re a local—but Marin is a hidden gem when it comes to culture. Because of Marin’s close proximity to the cultural and counter-cultural mecca of San Francisco, it has long been home to its own unique artistic endeavors, such as stunning outdoor performances set against the backdrop of the majestic Marin hills and an eclectic mix of indie films and thought-provoking documentaries.

If you’re looking for a more cultural experience to try in 2023, come explore the cultural landscape of Marin—we’ve got something for everyone.

## The Mountain Play

[The Mountain Play](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/arts-entertainment-cultural/mountain-play/) is a must-visit for those seeking a unique cultural experience in Marin. The open-air amphitheater hosts a new production each summer, featuring local actors and musicians. Attendees can enjoy classics like The Sound of Music and The Wizard of Oz or lesser-known gems like Hairspray and South Pacific while surrounded by stunning natural beauty. Don't miss the 2024 production of Kinky Boots currently live through June 18th.

Located just a short distance from San Francisco, the Mountain Play is easily accessible and provides a breathtaking setting for a memorable event. Besides the performance, visitors can pack a picnic and spend the day lounging on the grassy hillside, enjoying the many food vendors and other attractions on-site.

## Marin Cinema

Marin has a fantastic cinema scene with multiple theaters showcasing a variety of films, including independent and foreign films, documentaries, and blockbusters. A few things we suggest you check out are:

### Italian Film Fest at Dominican University

The [Italian Film Festival](https://www.italianfilm.com/), once an informal college presentation, is now a beloved annual event in the San Francisco Bay Area thanks to its devoted director, Lido Cantarutti. Enjoy an authentic Italian atmosphere, special appearances, and Italian films with English subtitles at the Dominican University festival. It's the perfect dinner-and-a-movie date destination for Italian film enthusiasts.

### Mill Valley Film Festival

Founded by Mark Fishkin in 1977, the non-competitive [Mill Valley Film Festival](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/arts-entertainment-cultural/california-film-institute/) draws new and established filmmakers to its 11-day event every October. With over 200 filmmakers from 50+ countries, the festival features submissions in six categories, from narrative to experimental, animation, children's films, and youth-produced films.

The festival's relaxed atmosphere encourages collaboration and conversation, making it a hotspot for the community. In fact, it’s so popular that it's the only prominent film festival in the San Francisco Bay Area in the fall, drawing large crowds and celebrity appearances, including Helen Mirren, Tim Robbins, and Billy Bob Thornton—it's no wonder the MVFF is called the "filmmakers' festival."

### DocLands

Presented by the [California Film Institute](http://www.cafilm.org/), the DocLands Documentary Film Festival brings compelling stories and the insights behind them to Marin County for four days each spring.

As a non-competitive, non-juried, inclusive festival that presents an overall Audience Choice award, it’s dedicated to building connections and partnerships that will invigorate the business and art of nonfiction filmmaking. Through public screenings and engaged conversations, DocLands aims to build an active, involved and fully supportive community around documentary film.

Marin Symphony

For decades, the [Marin Symphony Association](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/arts-entertainment-cultural/marin-symphony/) has been a prominent cultural organization in the Bay Area, bringing local classical music to Marin County. The symphony's goal is to create a shared experience of live music that connects with existing and new audiences by showcasing high-caliber symphonic concerts that express the beauty and excitement of classical music. The orchestra aims to engage and expand its community by exploring new possibilities and ways of listening, all while delivering innovative programs and performances.

## Mission San Rafael

Established in 1817, Mission San Rafael serves as an important reminder of California's rich history. Originally built as an assistencia or “helper” to care for the sick at Mission Dolores in San Francisco, it is now a replica of the original Spanish mission and is part of the Saint Raphael parish in downtown San Rafael.

In recognition of its cultural significance, San Rafael was honored as a [California Cultural District](https://www.marinij.com/2017/07/14/san-rafael-honored-as-a-california-cultural-district/) in 2017. The Mission Chapel is open to visitors daily, offering self-guided tours and an opportunity to connect with the state's past. Donations are welcome to support the preservation of this [important historical landmark](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/landmarks/mission-san-rafael-arcangel/).
