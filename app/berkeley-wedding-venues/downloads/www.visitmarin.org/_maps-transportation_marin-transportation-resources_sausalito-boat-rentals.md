Our 16-passenger cycle boat is a party on the water. With 10 pedal stations (plus lounge seating), this is the ultimate group experience for birthdays, team outings, bachelor and bachelorette parties, or just soaking in the Sausalito sun. Seats are just $50 per person for a two-hour cruise with a licensed captain on board.

Prefer to explore at your own pace? Our self-operated electric Duffy boats are quiet, easy to drive, and require no boating license. Cruise around Richardson Bay in comfort and style. Boats range from cozy 8-passenger models to 12-passenger options with premium amenities like retractable windows, built-in refrigerators, and on board speaker. Rental times range from 2 to 6 hours.

All of our boats stay within the calm and scenic waters of Richardson Bay between Sausalito and Belvedere, making it the perfect environment for a smooth and relaxing ride.
