# Sunset to Moonlight Kayak Tour

**Date** : Friday, January 2, 2026

**Time** : 4:00pm

**Phone** : (415) 669-2600

[**Website**](https://bluewaterskayaking.com/calendar/)

We will meet at Miller Park Boat Launch (next to Nick’s Cove Restaurant and Cottages). After organizing gear, reviewing basic kayaking instructions and safety procedures, we'll launch our boats and paddle across the bay to the Point Reyes National Seashore. As we kayak across the bay and along the shoreline we will discover the myriad and diverse animals which inhabit the Bay and its shores. We often see harbor seals, bat rays, leopard sharks, osprey, river otters, and sea lions. The area around Hog Island is also rich in wildlife and scenic beauty. After the sun sets, and the sky goes dark, we'll look to the sky for the moon and perhaps some stargazing. We'll paddle in the moonlight for a bit before making our way back to the boat launch.  
  
All guided tours are in tandem closed deck sea kayaks. Our double kayaks track well, are difficult to capsize, and are easy to maneuver. All the necessary gear such as life jackets, paddles, and spray skirts is provided.

Please visit the website listed above for more information.
