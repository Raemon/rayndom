# Experience the Magic of the Holidays—Marin Style

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Wednesday, November 5, 2025 by MCVB Staff

By Whitney Butler

In 1899, the San Francisco Call, a newspaper that served the Bay Area between 1890 and 1913, reported some unusual winter news in Marin:

“Snow fell for over two hours yesterday throughout a large part of Marin County and in some spots the fall was an inch in depth.”

Though snow isn’t likely on the forecast, Marin County has some exciting offerings slated for the upcoming holiday season. In true Marin fashion, family-friendly events showcase this region’s dedication to the arts—highlighting performance, dance and musical talent that rivals any large city.

So ditch the holiday crush and head to Marin County for great holiday-themed entertainment. Check out some of our favorite events below.

**Photos With Santa at Town Center Corte Madera**

From now till Christmas Eve, kids can visit Old St. Nick at Town Center in Corte Madera. Children of all ages will enjoy free photos with Santa. Sure, Santa’s not wearing tap shoes or playing the harp, but he’s performing an important role in the hearts of young children, and for that, we thank him.

Plus, who doesn’t love holiday shopping at this gorgeous outdoor mall? You can check your list twice here and support Hospice by the Bay volunteers who are generously providing free gift-wrapping for mall patrons.

Now, back to the arts!

**Marin Ballet Presents ‘The Nutcracker’**

If you’ve never seen _The Nutcracker_ during the holidays, stop what you’re doing and buy tickets to this enchanting event.

Rich in old-fashioned holiday grandeur, Clara’s whimsical Christmas Eve dreams come to life through the art of classical ballet enriched with clever storytelling, mischievous humor, heroic characters, and plenty of fanciful surprises. Lavish, Victorian costumes and sets frame choreography by Julia Adam and a cast of 100 local dancers as they bring adventure to life in this full-length ballet production. From Clara’s festive parlor…. complete with embattled mice and soldiers…. to the Enchanted Forest of the Snow Queen and across the sea to the Land of the Sweets, one never knows what the mysterious Herr Drosselmayer has in store! Marin Ballet’s Nutcracker is a lovely holiday experience to share with those you love. Welcome back to the theater!

Don’t wait to [scoop up tickets](https://marinballet.org/events/). The Marin Ballet performs in December for one weekend only at the Marin School of the Arts in Novato.

**Marin Symphony Holiday Choral Concerts by Candlelight**

This annual holiday celebration is located at the Church of St. Raphael in downtown San Rafael. Light a candle and sing along on December 2 and 3 to usher in the season.

Speaking of the Marin Symphony, don’t miss their Chamber Orchestra performances in January at the Mosher Marin JCC San Rafael or the Chamber Ensembles in February. Locations for the Symphony will vary. 

Don’t fret if you don’t experience snow this holiday season; after all, that’s what living in California is all about! But do take time to enjoy special seasonal performances featuring the talented people who make Marin County a steadfast hub for the arts.
