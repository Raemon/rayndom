# REAL ID 2025 Information

### What [California](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/real-id/) Travelers Need to Know About REAL ID 

**Are you ready for REAL ID?**

December 5, 2023:

Residents of California have an additional 24 months to [obtain their REAL IDs](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/12/05/dhs-announces-extension-real-id-full-enforcement-deadline), a document that will be necessary to board domestic flights and enter certain federal buildings, after the Department of Homeland Security on Monday extended the enforcement deadline to **May 7, 2025**.

Officials said the extension is needed, in part, because of lingering problems from COVID-19 that caused backlogs in state agencies charged with issuing driver’s licenses.

The State of California Department of Motor Vehicles requirements: Beginning **May 7, 2025** , you will need to show federally-compliant identification in order to board a domestic flight within the U.S. and enter secure federal facilities, such as military bases, federal courthouses, and other secure federal locations.  
Follow the [prompts here](https://www.dhs.gov/real-id/real-id-faqs) to find out if you need a REAL ID.

**The Marin Convention & Visitors Bureau** is working with the larger travel industry and our government partners to educate [California](https://realid.dmv.ca.gov/) travelers on REAL ID enforcement. Policy changes that allow alternative forms of authentication in place of a REAL ID at airport security checkpoints—including biometric screening and existing enrollment in Trusted Traveler Programs—can help mitigate the effects of REAL ID enforcement, while also ensuring a secure and efficient screening process.

It is our desire that all air travelers flying within the U.S. secure a REAL ID compliant form of identification well ahead of next year’s deadline in order to keep the air travel process moving without disruption.
