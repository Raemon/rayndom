# Dinner and a Show with Danny Click & the Hell Yeahs at Rancho Nicasio

**Date** : Saturday, December 7, 2024

**Time** : Music at 7:30pm

[**Website**](https://ci.ovationtix.com/35892/performance/11520379?performanceId=11520379)

Until a few years ago, Danny Click was one of Austin’s best-kept secrets, a musician’s musician who’d won the respect of some of alt-country’s biggest names but hadn’t yet found widespread recognition. That changed when Click's latest CD, Life Is A Good Place, was released in April, 2011 and spent more than 12 consecutive months on the Country, pop, and Americana radio charts.  
  
The first single, "Wait My Turn", reached #1 on Nashville’s Indie World Country Chart, and the second single, “I Feel Good Today”, topped out at #14 on the NMW national Country chart along side Keith Urban, Miranda Lambert and Taylor Swift.  
  
In the San Francisco Bay Area, where Click now resides, he's built a large and passionate fan base that includes musical greats Carlos Santana and Elvin Bishop, both of whom have joined him on stage multiple times for impromptu jams.  
  
What's causing all the buzz? First, there's Click's sound - a refreshing return to smart, sassy blues-inflected country rock. Then there are Click's live shows; an anything-can-happen mix of stellar songwriting alternating with blistering blues-rock. When Click brings it down with the strings-inflected "Blue Skies", you can hear every breath in the room; when he launches into the infectious "Wait My Turn," there's not one person who can stay seated.

General Admission Tickets are $26.00 per person and is for admission and music only. Dinner reservations are recommended between 4:00pm - 8:00pm. All tickets can be purchased in the above website link.
