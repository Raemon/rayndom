Founded in the same year as Earth Day, Slide Ranch was an early leader in the food sustainability movement. Since 1970, more than 200,000 visitors have experienced this inspiring place. 

Slide Ranch teaches visitors the impact our choices have on food, health, and the environment, through hands-on activities and independent exploration of our farm and coastal wild lands. 

As a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that relies on the generosity of partners and donors to support our life-changing environmental educational programs for all, Slide Ranch has been planting kids in nature since 1970. Our mission is to connect children and people of all ages to the outdoors and partner with community groups, families and educators to provide transformative learning experiences on our organic farm and national park land along the California coast. 

As part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area lands, our outdoor grounds are open to the public for hiking, fishing and picnicking. [More details here](https://www.slideranch.org/enjoy-slide).

Slide Ranch also offers a memorable and magical venue for your corporate retreat, event or wedding.
