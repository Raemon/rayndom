We have a ton of events dedicated to summer, with several seasonal festivals, fairs, parades, and markets that will take over your calendar. If you need a little help, we’ve got you covered with this perfect summer itinerary—we’re going to break down where you can go, what you can do, where to stay, and where to eat depending on your vacation goal.

## 

# Marin County Beaches

If you are the beach bum type, then embrace the summer vibes in Marin County by visiting one of these picturesque beaches. Marin has a coastline perfect for enjoying water sports, family outings, pet-friendly adventures, and quiet romantic strolls. Make sure to check our [Beach Travel Tips](https://www.visitmarin.org/beach-travel-tips/) before heading out.

# 

# Beach Itinerary #1: Discover Your Heart’s Desire 

Tucked away on the eastern side of Point Reyes National Seashore, this hidden sandy cove at Heart's Desire offers a serene setting with calm waters of Tomales Bay and scenic views of Marin County hills.

#### What to Do 

Start by taking the Tomales Point Trail to the Elk Refuge, where in addition to the Tule Elk, you may see coyotes and even the occasional mountain lion. For a thrilling kayaking experience, we recommend booking a trip with [Blue Waters Kayaking](https://www.visitmarin.org/outdoor-activities/kayaking/blue-waters-kayaking/).   
Choose from a variety of single and double sea kayaks, and opt for guided half or full-day paddles or even overnight camping expeditions. For a truly enchanting experience, consider joining one of their evening [Bioluminescence Tours](https://www.bluewaterskayaking.com/bioluminescence-evening-tours/).

#### Where to Stay

Stay at [Bear Valley Cottage](https://www.visitmarin.org/hotels/point-reyes/bear-valley-cottage/)! This home away from home comes complete with a convenient self-catering unit featuring a small kitchenette stocked with essentials to kickstart your stay. Just a short half-mile drive from the Bear Valley Visitor Center, this charming retreat provides effortless access to the entire Point Reyes area.

#### Where to Eat

Savor the flavors of the coast at [The Marshall Store](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/dining/california/the-marshall-store-oyster-bar-and-smokehouse-1-1/), where you can feast on freshly harvested oysters, homemade clam chowder, and other classic dishes crafted from seasonal, local ingredients. Complete your meal with a selection of beer and wine while soaking in picturesque views of Tomales Bay.

Nighttime: Enjoy dinner and music at [Rancho Nicasio](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/nightlife/live-music/rancho-nicasio-restaurant-bar-1/)—a historic roadhouse established in 1941 located on the town square in Nicasio, California. They have a full bar with an All Day Menu and [music](https://www.ranchonicasio.com/music.htm) on the weekend. Beginning Memorial Day weekend there is a Sunday BBQ on the lawn through the summer with great daytime music under the sun!

## 

# Itinerary #2: Avoid the Crowds at Dillon Beach

Dillon Beach is nestled along Marin County’s coast and offers a tranquil escape with panoramic views of the Pacific. It’s seldom crowded and is perfect for a stroll or adventurous activities like surfing and kite flying.

#### What to Do 

Situated at the entry point to West Marin and the Sonoma and Napa Valley wine regions, the [Marin French Cheese Company](https://www.visitmarin.org/culinary/food-and-wine/marin-french-cheese-company/) is a short drive from Dillon Beach. Enjoy some of their award-winning cheeses on their covered picnic tables, where you can also take in cold beverages, hot chocolate, coffee, soup, and sandwiches.

For a serene retreat, venture to [McEvoy Ranch](https://www.visitmarin.org/culinary/food-and-wine/mcevoy-ranch-1/), a sprawling 550-acre organic ranch nestled in the rolling hills of Marin County. Learn about their sustainable farming practices amidst scenic vineyards, olive groves, and hiking trails. Whether sampling Tuscan olive oils or admiring native wildlife, McEvoy Ranch is an idyllic escape for nature enthusiasts and food lovers alike.

#### Where to Eat

Daytime: Walk across the street from your hotel to partake in delicious, locally sourced food at [Route One Bakery & Kitchen](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/dining/bakery/route-one-bakery-kitchen/) in Tomales. From fresh bread and baked goods to beer, wine and cider made by the best of Marin, you’ll be sure to find something you like on their [menu](https://www.routeonekitchen.com/menu).

Improve your beach getaway by adding a summer outdoor concert to your itinerary and extending your stay. Rancho Nicasio hosts live music events throughout the year, while various parks, farmers markets, and shopping malls feature outdoor day concerts during the summer season.
