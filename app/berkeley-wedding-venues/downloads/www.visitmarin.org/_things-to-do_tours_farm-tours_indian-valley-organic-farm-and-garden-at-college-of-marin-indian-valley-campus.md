The Indian Valley Organic Farm and Garden (IVOFG) was created to support and sustain local food systems and organic agriculture, to help educate and develop the local agricultural workforce, and to provide fresh and healthy food for local residents. Located on College of Marin’s Indian Valley Campus, the College manages this certified organic farm with the support of its operational partners: The Cultural Conservancy and UCCE Marin Master Gardeners. 

Visitors are welcome to stop by the farm Tuesday through Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and meet the staff, take a self-guided tour, sign up to volunteer, or join the CSA Program. You can also buy produce from the farm stand Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. from July through October. 

Contact farm staff in advance for a guided visit or a custom farming/gardening class designed with the needs of your organization in mind.
