# Winter Water and Wildlife Guide to Marin County

Posted Wednesday, November 6, 2024 by MCVB Staff

By Joe Kukura

Winter is the time to cozy up and stay indoors — unless you’re in Marin County. The northern California getaway known as the “sunny side of the Golden Gate Bridge” is that rare place that’s even better to visit in the wintertime because the great outdoors gets even greater. [Winter in Marin County](https://www.visitmarin.org/blog/winter-outdoor-guide-to-marin-county/) features a Mediterranean climate that rarely dips below a comfy 50 degrees, and the winter months mean less traffic, fewer tourists and special seasonal wonders on both the land and the waters.

Rare and magnificent animals come out to play in the Marin County winter months, whether they’re coming through on migratory treks or just enjoying the weather. The water beckons in rivers and lakes for kayaking, canoeing, kiteboarding, and more varieties of water adventures. The days may get shorter, but here’s why the days also get better in Marin County winter.

**Winter Wildlife Watching**

The animals know that Marin County is the place to visit in the winter months, and there’s nothing like watching these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat. [Winter wildlife in Marin County](https://www.visitmarin.org/blog/the-best-winter-wildlife-watching-in-marin/) gives wildlife watchers a chance to see birds, beasts, and marine majesties.

[Marin County whale watching](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/wildlife/whale-watching/) makes these mammals maybe the most famous animals that pass through Marin’s Pacific shores in the wintertime. Whale season peaks in Marin County in December through April, when the California gray whales migrate to Mexico. Some of the best places to watch whales in Marin County are at the [Muir Beach Overlook](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/beaches-in-marin-county/muir-beach-muir-beach-overlook/) and [Point Reyes National Seashore](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/hiking/point-reyes-national-seashore/). Binoculars, of course, are highly recommended.

Right along Marin County’s coastal shores, [elephant seals, harbor seals and sea lions](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/wildlife/elephant-seals-harbor-seals-sea-lions/) can be seen doing what they do best: relaxing. One of the best places to watch seals in Marin County is from [Point Reyes’ Chimney Rock](https://www.visitmarin.org/places/experience-point-reyes/) — just keep those weekend road restrictions in mind.

Migratory birds love to fly through Marin County too, creating great [Marin County bird-watching](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/wildlife/bird-watching/) opportunities throughout the winter. Bald eagles are making a big comeback in Marin County, providing a rare opportunity to see these incredible birds in the winter months. Mountain bluebirds, warblers, and long-tailed ducks also breeze through during wintertime. You can catch sights of these amazing birds at [Muir Woods](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/protected-open-space-and-farmland/muir-woods-national-monument/) and [Mount Tamalpais](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/camping/mount-tamalpais-state-park/), and naturally, the [Audubon Canyon Ranch](https://www.egret.org/).

**Winter Kayaking and Water Sports**

The water’s great in Marin County, even in the winter. Kayaking, stand up paddleboarding and canoeing opportunities await and the experts are ready to help.

At the Point Reyes National Seashore,****[Blue Waters Kayaking](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/tours/water-sport-tours/blue-waters-kayaking-1/) lets you get the most out of those Pacific Ocean waters with canoe and kayak rentals, classes and guided tours or classes for all skill levels.

On the other side of Marin County, San Rafael Bay’s [101 Surf Sports](https://www.visitmarin.org/outdoor-activities/kayaking/101-surf-sports-1-1/) has been voted one of the top water sports shops in the United States. They offer the full array of paddleboard, kayak, canoe and windsurfing rentals, along with lessons and guided tours.

There’s more winter wonder in Marin County, including the only Marin indoor Holiday Lights[ at Northgate Mall](https://www.shopatnorthgate.com/events/) in San Rafael and heaping helpings of the famed Dungeness crab at [Marin County seafood restaurants](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/restaurants/seafood-restaurants/). Make it a long weekend with overnighters at the best [places to stay in Marin County](https://www.visitmarin.org/hotels/), and you’ll find yourself quickly warming up to winter in Marin County.
