# MALT Hosts Hike at Marindale Ranch

**Date** : Friday, October 3, 2025

**Time** : 10:00am - 2:00pm

[**Website**](https://malt.org/malt_events/oct-3-2025-hike-at-marindale-ranch/?utm_source=Marin+Agricultural+Land+Trust&utm_campaign=e230f000a3-EVENT_2025_FALL_HIKES&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_-d6716a3bc0-3960)

Be among the first to hike a newly opened to the public MALT-protected ranch!

Come and hike Marindale Ranch, also known as the Grossi Family Home Ranch. This dynamic 870-acre property located in Novato has been MALT-protected since 2003. Overlooking scenic Stafford Lake and with views of the San Francisco Bay, the ranch supports grass-fed cattle, is home to Sola Bee honey bees, and showcases remarkable biodiversity—from pinot noir vineyards and open pasture to a creek corridor and redwood forests.

Check-in begins at 10:00 am, followed by a short welcome and remarks from rancher Ralph Grossi at 10:15 am.

Choose from two scenic trails, opened to the public for the very first time, as part of this special MALT outing:

  * A 2.25-mile self-guided moderate loop with approximately 625 feet of elevation gain.
  * A 5-mile guided hike considered challenging, with approximately 900 feet of elevation gain, departing promptly at 10:30 am. Hiking poles, water bottles, and hats (as most of the hike is exposed) are strongly recommended. Minimum 30 minute/mile pace is required for this hike.



This is a free event, although a $25 donation is recommended. Registration is required in the above website link.
