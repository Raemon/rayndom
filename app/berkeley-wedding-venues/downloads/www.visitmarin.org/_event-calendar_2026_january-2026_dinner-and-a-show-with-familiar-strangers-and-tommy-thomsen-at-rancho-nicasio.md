[**Website**](https://ci.ovationtix.com/35892/production/1256703?performanceId=11719053)

The Familiar Strangers Trio/Quartet play an Americana grab bag of music from western swing to country, bluegrass, folk, blues and even a little bit of gypsy jazz! This band generates a big response from audiences with their friendly banter and responsiveness to requests from audience members. This is a band with a sense of humor that can easily move between material designed to get you up on your feet dancing or tugging at your heart to buy another beer and lose your sorrows. Their musical palette runs from Bob Wills to Doc Watson to Django Reinhardt and more.

Mae McCoy & her Neon Stars are Northern California's go-to-band for real- deal country, western swing, and California honky tonk.

Online dinner reservations are recommended from 6:00pm-8:00pm; Music starts at 7:30pm. Tickets are $25.00 per person and includes admission to show only; dinner is not included in the ticket price. All tickets can be purchased in the above webiste link.
