# Jessica Malone at Sweetwater Music Hall

**Date** : Thursday, June 27, 2024

**Time** : Doors Open at 7:00pm and Show Starts at 8:00pm

[**Website**](https://sweetwatermusichall.com/event/jessica-malone/sweetwater-music-hall/mill-valley-california/)

Invoking the soulfulness of Joni Mitchell, the raw power of Brandi Carlile, and the enchantment of First Aid Kit, Jessica Malone is not a mere blend of her influences but an acknowledgement of them—mixed with something purely singular and unique.

Malone combines a sultry voice, introspective lyrics, and an earthy folk-roots backing band to create both a healing balm for troubled times and a soundtrack for happier days, mastering the art of the solo acoustic songbird confession while also celebrating a rambunctious and rollicking full sound. 

The winner of several SAMMIES (Sacramento Music Awards) as Artist of the Year, Singer-songwriter of the Year, and Folk/Bluegrass Artist of the Year, Malone, who holds a BA in Vocal Performance, currently resides in Northern California, where she performs regularly with her band. 

General Admission Tickets are $20.00 in advance and $25.00 on Day of Show. All tickets can be purchased in the above website link.
