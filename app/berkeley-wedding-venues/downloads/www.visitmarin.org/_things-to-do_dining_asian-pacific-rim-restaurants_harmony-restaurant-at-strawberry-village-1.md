Following a rich tradition of quality dining in Marin, Harmony has created a warm and inviting place to enjoy classical and innovative Cantonese fare with its specialty – freshly hand crafted dim sum.

From our open kitchen, guests can enjoy an exhibition of dishes being prepared and soak in the splendid aromas of our signature specialties – from wok seared 100% certified Angus reserve beef, pan fried wild caught prawns, oven roasted local duck or 100% all natural chicken, to freshly hand crafted dim sum. Harmony's specialty, dim sum, is made fresh daily and is served for lunch and dinner. Seasonal selections with local ingredients; premium sakes, imported Asian beers, and organic wines.

**Hours of Operation:** Open daily from 11:00am - 2:30pm and 4:30pm - 8:00pm for take-out only.
