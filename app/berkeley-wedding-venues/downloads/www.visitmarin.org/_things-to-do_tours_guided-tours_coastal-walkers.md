Coastal Walkers introduces visitors and locals alike to the dramatic wild north coast of San Francisco and the Golden Gate. Our expertly guided, half-day walking tours are infused with California history and led by local guides along the beautiful unspoiled coast on the City's edge. Meandering along coastal foot paths and trails, you are rewarded with views so naturally stunning you will forget that a major city is directly behind you. Dip your feet in the Pacific (brrr!) and enjoy the fresh salt-air, brisk ocean breezes and panoramic views of the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco Bay and the Marin Headlands. With three world-class itineraries to choose from, our walking tours will be the best miles you'll ever enjoy on foot!

Experience the Natural Side of the Golden Gate Coastline - See marine mammals like sea lions, harbor seals, pods of dolphins, and, if you're lucky, migrating gray whales. Bird lovers will appreciate the over 250 species of coastal birds, including hawks, comorants, pelicans, and hummingbirds. In spring and summer, a wide variety of hardy coastal plants are in bloom along our paths.
