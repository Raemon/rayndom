# Guide to Point Reyes/Coastal Marin

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Wednesday, January 18, 2023 by MCVB Staff

By Megan Eileen McDonough

Point Reyes is easily one of Marin County’s most scenic highlights, and you won’t want to skip town without spending ample time exploring the park grounds. One of the perks of winter travel is that you’ll avoid the crowds. Plus, we can’t think of a better way to kick off the new year than with a jaunt in nature. Whether in town for a day, a week or a month, here are five ways to experience the best of coastal Marin.

**1\. Visit Point Reyes Lighthouse.**

There's nothing like a bird's eye view on a clear, crisp day to get your heart racing. [Point Reyes Lighthouse](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/landmarks/point-reyes-lighthouse/) itself is a sight to behold and the view gets better once you climb to the top. Winter is a great time to visit the lighthouse because if you're lucky, you'll spot the 30,000 gray whales that migrate to the Marin coast each winter. They travel all the way from the cold waters of Alaska. Also, keep an eye out for birds. The odds are definitely in your favor, especially since more than half the bird species in the United States have been spotted right here in Point Reyes.

**2\. Join a Point Reyes safari.**

Just because it's winter doesn't mean you can't get a little safari action! That said, it doesn't get terribly cold in Marin as it does in other coastal areas. [Point Reyes Safaris](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/tours/guided-tours/point-reyes-safaris-1/)’ tours host a maximum of three people, making it an ideal activity for a couple or group of friends. Because tours are so small, the guide caters to participants’ interests. So, whether you’re hoping to spot a rare bird or see a bobcat, your guide will do his best to make it happen. Choose between a half-day safari or a full, 10-hour-day excursion. You'll enter the park at sunrise and leave at sunset.

**3\. Go sea kayaking.**

Instead of staying within your comfort zone, test your limits with [Blue Waters Kayaking](http://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/guided-tours/blue-waters-kayaking-1/), which offers tours for all skill levels, including morning and evening paddles. For a true one-of-a-kind experience, paddle in the dark on a bioluminescence tour, where you’ll witness the eerie magic of glowing dinoflagellates. For a tour that combines your love for outdoor adventure and your fascination with wildlife, opt for the Drakes Estero option. You'll kayak through one of the last estuaries along the California coast as you paddle by eelgrass and kelp beds below and white pelicans, osprey, and geese above.

**4\. Tour West Marin by bike.**

West Marin is home to some pretty fantastic bike trails, and they’re arguably the best way to [tour the area](https://www.visitmarin.org/outdoor-activities/mountain-biking-and-road-cycling/). If you're having trouble picking a spot, narrow down your options based on interest. Beach bums should take the trail that ends at Marshall Beach on Tomales Bay. The journey begins uphill but it soon levels out to a flat road. Experienced riders seeking a challenge can opt for the Inverness Ridge trail, which is steep and narrow but boasts stunning views of Drakes Estero. Families or travelers new to biking can cycle along the Samuel P. Taylor trail. The path is paved for easy riding.

**5\. Learn a new recipe.**

West Marin’s culinary scene is anything but ordinary. In fact, you can actually take a cooking class at [Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Company](https://www.visitmarin.org/culinary/food-and-wine/the-fork-at-point-reyes-farmstead-cheese-company-1/). Farmstead also regularly hosts ticketed dinners, but those tend to sell out fast! If you’re not able to snag a space at Farmstead, splurge on a farm-to-table meal instead. There are plenty of top-tier restaurants nearby. Dishes are made using local ingredients, and as such, menus rotate seasonally. It's the perfect reward after an afternoon hiking through the grounds.
