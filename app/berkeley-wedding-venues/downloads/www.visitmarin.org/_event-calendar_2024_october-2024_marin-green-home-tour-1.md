# Marin Green Home Tour - Virtual

**Date** : Thursday, October 24, 2024

**Time** : 6:00pm - 8:00pm

[**Website**](https://www.maringreenhometour.org/)

The Marin Green Home Tour is a free, 2 evening virtual tour of 10 homes in Marin County. The event showcases what Marin residents are doing to combat climate change, improve air quality, generate clean energy, save energy, and water, and move toward a safer, healthier, greener, and more resilient future. The tour will feature new homes, major remodels, gradual retrofits, and low-cost, low-tech, do-it-yourself solutions for both homeowners and landlords/renters. The tour will also include short presentations by experts, links to relevant businesses, and useful resources, rebates, and incentives so attendees can benefit from the experience of our local sustainable living trend-setters.

Each 10-minute video tour of a home is followed by a live Q&A with the homeowner or landlord or renter. A panel of local experts will also be on hand to answer questions. The Marin Green Home Tour will be recorded and available on YouTube following the live event. The link to the recorded version will be emailed to all registrants and distributed to our sponsors and promotional partners.

Reservations are required and can be made in the above website link.
