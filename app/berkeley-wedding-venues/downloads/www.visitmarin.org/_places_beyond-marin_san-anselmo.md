[Destination San Anselmo](/places/beyond-marin/san-anselmo/destination-san-anselmo/)

Sunny San Anselmo’s climate, rich history, creek-side location, and strong sense of community make it a memorable place to visit. The railroad played a vital role in San Anselmo’s history. The town was mostly pastoral until 1875, when the North Pacific Railroad completed a line from Sausalito to Tomales, via San Anselmo. The town quickly became the “Hub” of much activity. With numerous annual events, hiking and biking trails, and fine dining opportunities, San Anselmo is still known as the “Hub” today.

One sight you don’t want to miss is the majestic castle-like grounds of the [University of Redlands Marin Campus](https://www.redlands.edu/meet-redlands/regional-campus-locations/marin-campus/), home of San Francisco Theological Seminary. Perched among scenic walkways on the knoll above Ross Valley, with extraordinary views of Mt. Tamalpais and Bald Hill. And Star Wars fans of all ages will want to visit [Imagination Park](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/landmarks/imagination-park/), the brainchild of George Lucas, with its much-beloved (and much-photographed) statues of Yoda and Indiana Jones.

While you’re here, be sure to stop by [Creekside Pizza and Taproom](http://www.creeksidesa.com/), just voted as Marin's Best Pizza and some of San Anselmo’s other attractions, including the Robson-Harrington House and Park and the Carnegie Library; [shopping](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/san-anselmo-shopping/) and more!
