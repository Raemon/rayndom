Welcome to our 1,700 acres of open space in the heart of West Marin. Located 30 minutes from the towns of Petaluma, Novato, and Point Reyes and one hour north of San Francisco, Walker Creek Ranch is a private haven to be one with nature, wildlife and the beautiful outdoors we call home. Walker Creek Ranch is a private property and advanced reservations are required.

Walker Creek Ranch is home to Marin County Office of Education’s outdoor school for 5th and 6th graders with an expansive campus that includes a ball field, a four-acre pond, two amphitheaters, as well as a large dining hall and grounds for weddings and other special events. 

With over 20 miles of walking trails and featuring access to Walker Creek and a panoramic view of Tomales Bay and the Sonoma Mountains from the top of Walker Peak. Keep an eye out for banana slugs, deer, foxes, river otters, turkey vultures and newts! [More information on trails and recommended hikes here](https://www.walkercreekranch.org/open-space).

We have a variety of locations for your group to gather. Whether it’s a group of 25 people who need a meeting space, or a large event with up to 300 people, we have many offerings to choose from. In addition, we have a variety of activities available to make your time here special, from swimming or boating in our four-acre pond, hiking or team building sessions with our naturalists, even activities for the evening that could include firepit socials to dancing in our rustic barn.
