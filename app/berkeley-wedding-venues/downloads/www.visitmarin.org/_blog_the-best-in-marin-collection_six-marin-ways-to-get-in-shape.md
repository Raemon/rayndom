# Six "Marin" Ways to Get in Shape

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Wednesday, August 20, 2025 by MCVB Staff

By Megan Eileen McDonough

Ready to up your [fitness](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/) game? You’re in luck because Marin County offers both indoor and outdoor activities, and there’s something for every skill set. Whether you’re looking for the long, lean physique achieved by barre class or eager to explore the great outdoors with a leisurely hike, these five workouts are sure to get you in tip-top shape for the holidays. 

**Interval Training: Orangetheory Fitness**

Interval training is definitely one of the tougher workouts out there, but it’s also one of the most rewarding, not to mention one of the highest calorie burners. At the Mill Valley [Strawberry Village](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/shopping-centers/strawberry-village/)'s [Orangetheory Fitness](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/orangetheory-fitness-at-bon-air-greenbrae/), each 60-minute class is split into intervals of cardiovascular and strength training. There are heart rate monitors to track intensity and metabolic burn. During class, you’ll visit three main stations: a weight floor, a water rower, and a treadmill. Come prepared, as you’ll be putting your endurance and strength to the test! 

**Indoor Cycling: SoulCycle**

If you’ve ever wondered what all the [SoulCycle](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/soulcycle-at-marin-country-mart/) hype is about, here’s your chance to find out. Located at the [Marin Country Mart](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/shopping-centers/marin-country-mart/) in Larkspur, this high-energy workout will get your heart pumping and your feet pedaling. Each class is structured similarly—with an inspirational instructor shouting encouragements via a microphone, (almost) total darkness and beat-heavy music to keep you going. Technically, you might be staying still on a stationary bike, but you’ll feel like you’ve just biked your heart out.

**Overall Wellness: YogaWorks**

Just because yoga takes a slower approach doesn’t mean it’s not a full-body workout. In fact, yoga has been proven to aid the body tremendously—from improving muscle strength and circulatory health to increasing flexibility and maintaining a balanced metabolism. Plus, it’s a go-to way to de-stress before the holidays. Take a class at [Love Story Yoga](https://marincountrymart.com/love-story-yoga), also at the [Marin Country Mart](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/shopping-centers/marin-country-mart/). Classes are suitable for all skill sets and experience levels. Choose among several styles: vinyasa flow, candle flow, hatha yoga and more. 

**Low-Impact Results: Pure Barre**

Looking for a workout that’s less strenuous than cycling but burns more calories than yoga? Sign up for a class at [Pure Barre](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/pure-barre-at-strawberry-village/) at [Strawberry Village](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/shopping-centers/strawberry-village/) in Mill Valley. In short, this total-body workout utilizes the ballet barre to work all the major muscle groups, with extra emphasis on the glutes, inner thighs and abs. It might sound easy, but expect a challenge as you burn fat, sculpt muscles and create a long, lean physique. The studio is located on Redwood Highway and is very accessible by car.

**Outdoor Hiking: Coastal Walkers**

Not into indoor workouts? We’ve got you covered. Marin County has several tour operators that lead walking and hiking tours to various viewpoints. One such company, [Coastal Walkers](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/walking-tours-1/coastal-walkers-1/), specializes in guided, half-day walking tours led by Bay Area locals. There are five itineraries to choose from, depending on what sort of landscape and wildlife you’re eager to see (and there’s lots to see!). Opt for the redwoods-themed tour for a quiet, shaded stroll or explore the wild coast of Lands End. 

**Horseback Riding: Five Brooks Ranch**

One of the best ways to explore Point Reyes is by horseback. [Five Brooks Stables](https://www.visitmarin.org/outdoor-activities/horseback-riding/five-brooks-ranch/), located just off Highway 1 near Olema, is the only in-park concession to offer guided trail rides, private rides, pony rides, and lessons. With over 120 miles of trails, from forested ridges to grassy meadows and miles of quiet wilderness beaches, Point Reyes is a perfect place to ride a horse and to get those muscles working!
