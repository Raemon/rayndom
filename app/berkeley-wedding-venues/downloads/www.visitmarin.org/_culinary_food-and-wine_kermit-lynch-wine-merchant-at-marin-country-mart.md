Kermit Lynch Wine Merchant is a renowned importer, retailer, wholesaler, and distributor of fine French and Italian wines, headquartered in Berkeley, California. Since opening his eponymous shop in 1972, Kermit Lynch has championed small, independent winegrowers whose wines reflect the true character of their regions. By sourcing directly from domaines across France and Italy, he introduced wine lovers to expressive, terroir-driven bottles long before it became the norm.

This Bay Area institution’s arrival in Marin marks their second retail location, bringing the same high-touch, friendly environment from their Berkeley shop, along with a dedication to authenticity, provenance, and taste to a new community of wine enthusiasts. 

**Hours of Operation:** Sunday - Friday: 10:00am - 6:00pm
