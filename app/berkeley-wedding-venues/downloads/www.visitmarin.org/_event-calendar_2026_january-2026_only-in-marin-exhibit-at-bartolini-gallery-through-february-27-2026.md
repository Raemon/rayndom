# Only in Marin Exhibit at Bartolini Gallery Through February 27, 2026

**Date** : Friday, January 2, 2026

**Time** : 10:00am - 4:00pm Monday - Friday

[**Website**](https://www.marincounty.gov/departments/cultural-services/art-exhibits/bartolini-gallery-0)

Presented in honor of Marin County’s 175th anniversary, the exhibit pays tribute to one of California’s original 27 counties, formally established by the first State Legislature on September 16, 1850, just months before California joined the Union. At its founding, Marin was organized into four townships—Sausalito, Bolinas, San Rafael, and Novato—and was home to just 323 residents.

Only in Marin features more than 75 photographs by members of the Marin Photography Club, each image a celebration of the county’s remarkable beauty, boundless creativity, and vibrant diversity. From sweeping landscapes and graceful birds in flight to striking architecture and expressive portraits, the exhibition captures the essence of life in Marin—its natural splendor and its human spirit.

Over the past 175 years, Marin has blossomed into a hub of artistic energy and innovation. Its hills, valleys, and shores have inspired generations of artists, authors, musicians, filmmakers, dancers, actors, and visionaries whose creative contributions continue to enrich the cultural landscape. Only in Marin honors this enduring spirit—one that makes Marin not just a place, but a living work of art.
