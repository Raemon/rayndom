Closing Night is especially a night you don't want to miss with the premiere of Rental Family.   
Brendan Fraser’s (_The Whale_ , MVFF45) enormous talent for playing empathetic characters is put to brilliant use in this crowd-pleasing comedy drama. An actor who has lived in Tokyo for seven years where parts for Americans are few, Philip (Fraser) is grateful when he gets a gig to play a mourner at an actual funeral. The job is his introduction to a unique Japanese industry where people lacking family or friends or colleagues can hire surrogates to fill those roles. Philip signs on full-time, but his compassion for his clients coupled with his own deep loneliness creates chaos at their homes and his hiring agency when he begins crossing boundaries. With her second feature, writer-director Hikari (_37 Seconds_ , MVFF42) strikes a delicate balance between laughs and poignancy in a film that celebrates the power of human connection. And Fraser is simply phenomenal as a man who rediscovers his own need for kinship through this unusual work opportunity. —Pam Grady

Celebrating 48 years of film in Marin County from October 2nd through October 12th! The internationally renowned Mill Valley Film Festival offers a high-profile, prestigious, non-competitive environment ideal for celebrating the best in independent and world cinema. MVFF (the oldest fall film festival in California) remains committed to celebrating film and filmmakers and offering the highest resources and production elements possible, whatever challenges the world throws our way. We are approaching 2025 with the same commitment to quality and openness as we plan to showcase new cinema at MVFF48.
