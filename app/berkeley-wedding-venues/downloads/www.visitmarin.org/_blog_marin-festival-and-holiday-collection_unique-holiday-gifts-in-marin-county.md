# Unique Holiday Gifts in Marin County

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Wednesday, September 18, 2024 by MCVB Staff

By Megan Eileen McDonough

With the [holidays](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/) just around the corner, it’s time to start shopping for that special gift for your special someone. From delicious pastries and personalized fragrances to one-of-a-kind antiques, your friends and family are in for a real treat. Here are a few of our top gift-giving ideas. 

**Madge & Me Hats**

The hat you choose, whether selected from the shop's ready-to-wear collection or “bespoke,” will be made to your measurements and especially just for you! The staff will look forward to making you or your loved one a hat that will be a treasured fashion accessory for now and many years to come.   
[Madge & Me Hats ](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/boutiques-gift-shops/madge-me-hats-1/)proudly features an ever-changing array of art, jewelry and other handmade wares and ephemera, all created by local artists and craftspeople. From time to time we host pop-up events and offer occasional hat-making classes and hat repair “clinics.” 

**Belinda Wickwire Jewerly**

Connecting the power of history with the wearer of today. Breathing new life into antique remnants so that they may become your heirloom is what [Belinda Wickwire Jewelry](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/boutiques-gift-shops/belinda-wickwire-jewelry-1/) is all about. Featured in this year's Marin Living magazine Style&Swagger, Belinda wants to help you celebrate the beauty in life with her jewelry. Visit her retail store on San Anselmo Avenue for unique gift-giving ideas. 

**Indoor Antique Market**

In search of a one-of-a-kind gift? Head to the Marin [Outdoor French Antique Market](https://www.thefrenchmarketmarin.com/) in San Rafael. With more than 140 booths to peruse, you’ll find a little bit of everything, from fine art and vintage jewelry to watches and books. Whether shopping for decorative items for your holiday table or looking for unique stocking stuffers, there’s something for every taste and temperament at the market. Come ready to bargain hunt, as you search for buried treasure. 

**Rustic Bakery at Marin Country Mart**

If you’re shopping for a foodie, we’ve got you covered. [Rustic Bakery](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/restaurants/farm-to-table/rustic-bakery/) is not only a great place to pop in for a healthy lunch, but it’s also great for shopping for friends and family. There are several locations throughout Marin, including Marin Country Mart in Larkspur. Owner Carol LeValley is best known for her fresh and flavorful flatbreads, but pick up other snacks here as well, like granola, cookies, muffins, and croissants. For the freshest selections, buy a gift card so your friends can shop at their convenience.

**One-of-a-Kind Experiences**

The holidays are a time of giving, but don’t limit your gifts to material items. Some of the best presents are those you can’t hold in your hands. Here are a few of our favorites.

Treat you and your family to the Marin Art and Garden Center's new [Autumn Showcase.](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2024/november-2024/autumn-showcase-at-the-studio-at-marin-art-garden-center-october-11-november-10-2024-1/) Visit The Studio to experience the collaboration between the Marin Open Studio and the Marin Art and Garden Center, two leading Marin arts organizations. The showcase includes original works of art from painters, photographers, textile makers, printmakers, and sculptors. This continues on weekends through November 10th. December 6th through the 15th will feature another holiday experience - a [Winter Wonderland](https://www.visitmarin.org/event-calendar/2024/december-2024/winter-wonderland-at-marin-art-garden-center-december-6-15/), which includes an outdoor skating rink in the garden.

Plan a drive to the local [Marin Coast Ranch](https://marincoastranch.com/collections/pasture-raised-lamb) and greet the rancher, who hands over a neatly packaged order of grass-fed lamb, perfect for the holiday feast. With a sense of gratitude for the farm-to-table experience, envision the meal that will soon bring friends and family together.

Or simply pamper your bestie with a visit to [9 Corners Med-Cryo](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/9-corners-med-cryo-spa-at-vintage-oaks-novato/) in the Vintage Oaks Shopping Center. Choose from a variety of treatments, including Infra Red Saunas, facials, and massages. Go in person or splurge on a gift card.
