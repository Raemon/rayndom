# Marin County’s Best Cocktail Bars

Posted Wednesday, January 10, 2024 by MCVB Staff

By Joe Kukura

Some of the finest mixed drinks of the emerging [California craft cocktail movement](https://www.visitmarin.org/blog/best-craft-cocktails-in-marin-county/) are found on the rocks of the Pacific Coast in Marin County. Located straight up the Golden Gate Bridge across from San Francisco and just a dash south of wine country, Marin County is home to a premium list of swanky cocktail establishments and a top-shelf blend of [bars](https://www.visitmarin.org/businesses/nightlife), [lounges and restaurants](https://www.visitmarin.org/businesses/dining).

Whether you’re thirsty for an old-fashioned mixed drink or an innovative beverage concept with a twist, here’s proof that Marin County cocktail bars are always high in spirits. Pull up a Collins glass and let’s take a look the [fresh seafood restaurants](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/dining/seafood-restaurants/), [farm-to-table dining destinations](https://www.visitmarin.org/businesses/dining/farm-to-table) and [trendy nightlife hotspots](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/nightlife/) serving the best cocktails in Marin County.

**HopMonk Tavern Novato**

Novato’s****[HopMonk Tavern](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/nightlife/bars/hopmonk-tavern-novato/) is renowned for its live music every weekend (and plenty of weeknights too), but you’ll really want to get down with their ingenious and original HopMonk bartenders' creations. Pick from the Stoli-infused Blueberry Mint Lemonade, the apple-packed Moonshine Shandy or Barrel Aged Manhattan to wash down some satisfying house-smoked barbecue or seasonal fish.

**Nick's Cove Restaurant and Oyster Bar**

Nick’s Cove is a breathtaking collection of overnight cottages right along Tomales Bay, and****[Nick's Cove Restaurant and Oyster Bar](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/nightlife/bars/nick-s-cove-restaurant-oyster-bar-and-cottages/) features the award-winning cuisine of executive chef Joshua Seibert. The locally grown food is paired with Marin County-inspired cocktails like the Tomales Tonic, the Hog Island Iced Tea and the Highway1Trip.

**Rancho Nicasio Restaurant & Bar**

The crown jewel of the town square of Nicasio is the****[Rancho Nicasio Restaurant & Bar](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/nightlife/bars/rancho-nicasio-restaurant-bar/), a restored historic roadhouse whose bar is a step back to Old West yesteryear. A rural treasure on five acres of Marin County scenery, the Rancho Nicasio Bar features a wide variety of popular liquors to go along with live music every weekend.

R**ock N' Rye**

Just across the Golden Gate Bridge, The Rock & Rye at [Sweetwater's Music Hall](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/nightlife/live-music/sweetwater-music-hall/) welcomes diners and beverage enthusiasts to a premier destination in the picturesque town of Mill Valley. The menu features everything from a classic Caesar salad and burger to vegan dishes such as fava bean stew. The grand bar in the hall offers an extensive collection of spirits and hand-crafted cocktails such as their signature Rock & Rye.

Shake up your craft cocktail explorations in Marin County, an emerging “spiritual” destination with outstanding [shopping](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/shopping/) and [places to stay](https://www.visitmarin.org/hotels/). Pour one out for your next weekend getaway in Marin County, an unforgettable place where the only bitters are in your perfect Manhattan.
