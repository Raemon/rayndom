Inspired by her love of Tuscan olive oil, Nan founded McEvoy Ranch in 1990. Today, we are in our 30th year making the highest quality, award-winning, estate Extra Virgin olive oils, small-lot wines, and culinary products.

Located 30 miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge in the rolling hills of Marin County, McEvoy Ranch is a 550-acre working, organic ranch, committed to sustainable farming practices. Tuscan olive trees and vineyards are nestled amongst natural ponds, hiking trails, and native wildlife, creating relaxing and spectacular views.

To maintain a healthy balance with our natural surroundings, only 15% of our ranch is planted. This purposeful strategy aligns with our strong commitment to ensuring we provide good land stewardship for our olive orchards, grape vineyards, and other fruits, vegetables, and flora grown on the estate.

Certified by the Leaping Bunny organization, our ODE Natural Beauty Collection is infused with 100% organic olive oil and botanicals. The products, inspired by the scents and aromas on the Ranch, can be found in exclusive spas and in premium retailers throughout the globe.

Tours, tastings, and workshops are available by appointment only. Please call 707-769-4138, email [Visit@McEvoyRanch.com](mailto:Visit@McEvoyRanch.com), or visit [our website](https://www.mcevoyranch.com/visit-the-ranch/experience-the-ranch/) to make a reservation.
