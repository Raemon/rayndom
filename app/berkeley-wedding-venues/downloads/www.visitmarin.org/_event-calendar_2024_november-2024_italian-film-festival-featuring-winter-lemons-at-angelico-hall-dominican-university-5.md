# Italian Film Festival Featuring "Winter Lemons" at Angelico Hall, Dominican University

**Date** : Saturday, November 2, 2024

**Time** : 5:30pm and 8:00pm

[**Website**](https://www.italianfilm.com/index.html)

Presented by Lido Cantarutti, the Italian Film Festival started out as an informal one-time only presentation of Italian movies in a college lecture hall. Now celebrating 46 years, the Italian Film Festival of Marin County is on Saturdays from September 28 - November 2, 2024. Mr. Cantarutti has presnted appearances from Italian film directors and composers, dignitaries of the Italian and Italian-American communities, and an authentically Italian atmosphere at every presentation.   
  
All films are in Italian or original language with subtitles in English. All films are suggested for mature audiences. 

"Winter Lemons ("I LIMONI D'INVERNO") is a 2023 drama in color and lasts 110 minutes.  
Directed by Caterina Carone, with Christian De Sica, Teresa Saponangelo, and Francesco Bruni

Pietro is a refined 70-year-old retired literature professor who leads a solitary life. The plants on his terrace are his sole concern, especially the lemon tree, even though it has not been bearing fruit since his wife's death. Eleonora, 40, has recently moved with her husband Luca into the apartment facing Antonio's. On a hot summer night, when Luca is away, Eleonora and Pietro meet while they water their plants. It is a magical, seductive encounter that, night after night, will turn into a silent appointment and bring them ever closer.
