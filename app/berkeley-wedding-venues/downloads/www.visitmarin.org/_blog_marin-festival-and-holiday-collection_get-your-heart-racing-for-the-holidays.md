# Get Your Heart Racing for the Holidays

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Tuesday, October 15, 2024 by MCVB Staff

As the holidays approach, there’s no better time to get active and shed those extra pounds you may have gained after indulging in some of your favorite Halloween treats. In Marin County, staying fit means working up a sweat while enjoying the breathtaking landscapes and fun local activities.

Whether you prefer hiking through rugged trails, biking, or wing foiling on the water, there are multiple ways to keep your heart racing and your body in shape. Here are a few ways to combine fitness with fun heart-racing activities to slim down before enjoying those hearty November and December meals!

### **Learn to Wing Foil with 101 Surf Sports**

If you're looking for a heart-pumping water sport that challenges both your body and mind, wing foiling is an exciting option to try! Combining elements of windsurfing, kitesurfing, and stand-up paddleboarding, wing foiling offers a full-body workout that’s as thrilling as it is rewarding. Balancing on the board while maneuvering the wing in the wind engages your core, improves balance, and gives you a fantastic cardiovascular workout!

[101 Surf Sports](https://101surfsports.com/) is your go-to for all things water sports in Marin County. As a full-service water sports shop, they specialize not only in wing foiling but also offer a range of activities like stand-up paddleboarding (SUP), windsurfing, kiteboarding, and kayaking. They provide both [lessons](https://101surfsports.com/pages/learn-wingfoiling-its-as-easy-as-1-2-3) and [equipment rentals](https://101surfsports.com/pages/sup-rentals) to help you get out on the water.

But don’t stop at wing foiling—Marin County's coastal beauty makes it an ideal location for other [water sports](https://www.visitmarin.org/outdoor-activities/outdoor-adventures-in-san-rafael/). From sailboarding and surfing to boating and fishing, the opportunities are endless.

### **Winter Hikes and Wildlife at Point Reyes**

With scenic views, challenging trails, and the chance to see some of California’s most iconic wildlife, Point Reyes is a perfect destination for those looking to get their heart racing this winter! The rugged terrain of [Point Reyes](https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/hiking_guide.htm) provides hikers with various trails that range from short, one-hour hikes to more intense, three-hour adventures. Whether navigating coastal paths or forested trails, you'll find something to suit your schedule and fitness level.

One of the highlights of winter hiking in Point Reyes is the chance to spot some of Marin's most majestic wildlife. The area is home to [tule elk](https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/nature/tule_elk.htm), which can be seen grazing on the open grasslands. These incredible creatures are best viewed at the Tule Elk Reserve at Tomales Point, a must-see stop along your hike.

Also, though a Marin winter looks different than the mountains, it’s good to know that winter is prime time for viewing [elephant seals](https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/wildlife_viewing_elephantseals.htm#CP_JUMP_5649712), particularly at Point Reyes’ beaches, where they come ashore to breed. Viewing these seals will definitely get your heart racing!

### **Spend a Day at a Bike Park**

Ready to get pedaling? Cycling is a fantastic full-body workout that strengthens your legs, core, and arms while boosting endurance. If you’re someone who loves a good adrenaline rush, spending a day at [Stafford Lake Bike Park](https://www.visitmarin.org/outdoor-activities/mountain-biking-and-road-cycling/stafford-lake-bike-park/) can be both fun and rewarding. As the North Bay's first public bike park, Stafford Lake offers 17 acres of exciting trails, jumps, and obstacles for cycling enthusiasts of all skill levels.

And if the outdoors isn’t quite your scene, we’ve got something for you too! [SoulCycle at Marin Country Mart](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/soulcycle-at-marin-country-mart/) provides a high-energy, full-body workout. With upbeat music and motivational coaching, SoulCycle combines strength and cardio in a community-driven atmosphere, making fitness both entertaining and effective.

### **Make a Splash and Go Swimming**

Swimming is a low-impact, full-body workout that strengthens muscles and improves cardiovascular health. Whether you're gliding through open water or doing laps in a pool, it’s a quick calorie burner and a great way to build endurance.

For an open-water experience, [McNears Beach](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/kid-friendly-activities/mcnears-beach/) offers a refreshing swim in San Pablo Bay, perfect for boosting stamina in a scenic, natural setting.

However, if you prefer the pool, we've got the [Miwok Aquatic & Fitness Center at the College of Marin](https://www.visitmarin.org/outdoor-activities/sports/miwok-acquatic-fitness-center-at-college-of-marin-indian-valley-campus/). The center has an Olympic-size pool, a six-lane warming pool, and a dive pool—all surrounded by scenic landscapes. You can swim laps, take classes, or enjoy recreational swims in state-of-the-art surroundings.

### **Power Up with HIIT Workouts**

Fitness studios in Marin County offer dynamic environments to upgrade your workout routine. Workouts incorporating High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) can help maximize calorie burn in minimal time with exercises like burpees, jump squats, and sprint drills.

[Orangetheory Fitness at Strawberry Village](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/orangetheory-fitness-at-strawberry-village/) specializes in HIIT-based classes with heart rate monitors to help you track intensity and achieve the best results. For a broader fitness experience, [Bay Club Marin at Town Center Corte Madera](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/bay-club-marin/) is the ultimate lifestyle escape. From squash courts and group classes such as MyRide+ cycling and Pilates to luxurious facilities like a 25-yard indoor pool, members can access the best fitness and wellness!

**Find Peace in Mindful Movements**

Looking for a way to tone your body while calming your mind? Yoga and Pilates provide a harmonious mix of strength, flexibility, and mindfulness.

At [Mighty Pilates in Marin Country Mart](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/mighty-pilates/), you’ll enjoy dynamic classes that mix core strength, cardio, and stretching in a fun and inspiring space. For a modern take on Pilates, [Club Pilates at Vintage Oaks Novato](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/club-pilates-at-vintage-oaks-novato/) offers Reformer-based classes suitable for all ages and fitness levels.

And if you're more of a yogi with a strong craving for spiritual growth, make sure to drop by [Love Story Yoga at Marin Country Mart](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/love-story-yoga-at-marin-country-mart/). With curated playlists and chanting, their classes help detox and de-stress—an energizing practice for both body and soul.

### **Barre Workouts for a Stronger You**

The barre workout is a popular fitness practice incorporating elements from ballet, Pilates, and yoga. It's known for its focus on alignment, strength, and flexibility. Barre workouts often involve using a ballet barre for support, but they can also be done without one. The exercises typically target specific muscle groups, including the core, legs, and arms.

Pure Barre is the largest, most established barre franchise in North America, with more than 400 studios. Pure Barre offers these total body workouts at two convenient locations in Marin County—[Vintage Oaks Novato](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/pure-barre-at-vintage-oaks-novato/) and [Strawberry Village](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/pure-barre-at-strawberry-village/). Along with barre lessons, they also offer DVDs, equipment, and chic athletic apparel.

### **Relax, Rejuvenate, and Recover**

For a luxurious wellness experience, head to [International Orange at Marin Country Mart](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/fitness-and-wellness/international-orange-at-marin-country-mart/). This serene spa offers a wide range of treatments, including facials, massages, acupuncture, and more, all in a peaceful setting. With amenities like steam rooms and an indoor-outdoor lounge, it’s an ideal spot to unwind.

Whether you're looking for targeted treatments or holistic health solutions, their personalized care helps you achieve balance and well-being.
