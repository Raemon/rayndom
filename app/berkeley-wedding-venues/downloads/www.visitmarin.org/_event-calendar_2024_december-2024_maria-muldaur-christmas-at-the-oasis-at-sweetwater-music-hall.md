# Maria Muldaur Christmas at the Oasis at Sweetwater Music Hall

**Date** : Friday, December 20, 2024

**Time** : Doors Open at 7:00pm and Show Starts at 8:00pm

[**Website**](https://sweetwatermusichall.org/event/maria-muldaur-christmas-at-the-oasis-2/sweetwater-music-hall/mill-valley-california/)

Maria Muldaur is best known world-wide for her 1974 mega-hit “Midnight at the Oasis,” which received several Grammy nominations, and enshrined her forever in the hearts of Baby Boomers everywhere; but despite her considerable pop music success, her 56-plus year career could best be described as a long and adventurous odyssey through the various forms of American Roots Music. During the Folk Revival of the early ’60s, she began exploring and singing early Blues, Bluegrass and Appalachian “Old Timey” Music, beginning her recording career in 1963 with the Even Dozen Jug Band and shortly thereafter, joining the very popular Jim Kweskin Jug Band, touring and recording with them throughout the ’60s.

In the 47 years since “Midnight at the Oasis,” Maria has toured extensively worldwide and has recorded 43 solo albums covering all kinds of American Roots Music, including Gospel, R&B, Jazz and Big Band (not to mention several award-winning children’s albums). She has now settled comfortably into her favorite idioms, Blues and what she calls “Bluesiana”- a gumbo of New Orleans flavored Blues, R&B, and “Swamp Funk”. Often joining forces with some of the top names in the business, Maria has recorded and produced on-average an album per year, several of which have been nominated for Grammys and other awards.

Over the years, as an antidote to all the sappy and sentimental Christmas tunes we are all inundated with every holiday season, Maria Muldaur has collected some wonderfully hip, swinging, humorous and irreverent Christmas songs by her favorite Jazz and Blues artists. She and her “A Team” of some of the Bay Area’s finest jazz players will be presenting her special “Christmas at The Oasis” show, for a fun evening of what Maria calls “Christmas tunes for Hipsters.” There will be no corny, overdone, pedestrian Christmas tunes here, only her special collection of rare gems! Don’t miss this Holiday event!

General Admission Tickets are $34.51 per person in advance and $39.66 on day of show. All tickets include service fees and can be purchased in the above website link.
