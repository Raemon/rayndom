1,000 acres on the California Coast nearly untouched by humans since gold rush settlers in the 1800s laid claim to the land ... Marin Coast Ranch is a family owned and operated private ranch, home to Purebred Angus cattle and a flock of hardy crossbred sheep. With natural farming for beef and lamb, we believe we are working in a partnership with the land to produce wholesome nutrients for a local community population.

We want to help our local community to truly return to the way people used to live with ethically raised and harvested beef and lamb is our goal. We want to produce food from the land with a conscious effort to care for the land which, in turn, gives us back nutrients. Natural farming is a choice our family made. Not only are we protecting the animals from being influenced by unnatural sources, we are also protecting the land. If we do not care for the land, we do not have a future.

We are proud to offer humanely and sustainably raised beef and lamb in Marin and Sonoma County communities for local pick up. Raised in fresh air and on lush pastures of West Marin grass. 

The ranch is about an hour and a half north of San Francisco and about two miles from Tomales Bay, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean. Farm management has a focus on regenerative agriculture practices, such as carbon farming.
