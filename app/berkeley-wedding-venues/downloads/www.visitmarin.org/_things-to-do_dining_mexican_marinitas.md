Marinitas features a menu inspired by dishes found throughout Mexico and Latin America using local and seasonal products, as well as delivering Latin focused lusciousness that is an exciting blend of the new and the familiar. Cocktails focus on the silver and gold liquors of Central and South America. The bar is dedicated to classic cocktail preparations including citrus juice squeezed to order, house made sweet and sour made from unrefined cane sugars, along with the highest quality mixers.

Marinitas offers an authentic taste of Mexican food in Marin County, where traditional flavors meet modern culinary artistry. Signature dishes include our classic tacos, enchiladas and cerviche. [Menu Here](https://marinitas.com/menu/)
