# Picnic Like a Local in Marin

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Thursday, August 7, 2025 by MCVB Staff

## Lesser-Known Spots Worth the Blanket Spread

Marin is full of scenic spots to spread out a blanket and take in the view, but some of the best places to picnic aren’t in the guidebooks. These are the places locals return to—quiet, beautiful, and just far enough off the beaten path to feel like a discovery. We’re spotlighting five of those lesser-known gems here, perfect for a peaceful afternoon in the fresh air.  
From hidden meaderies to shaded garden groves, these are the quiet corners locals love and visitors rarely find.

## Sip, Savor, and Picnic at McEvoy Ranch

Tucked into the rolling hills just outside Petaluma, [McEvoy Ranch](https://www.visitmarin.org/culinary/food-and-wine/mcevoy-ranch-1/) feels like a slice of Tuscany in Marin. This 550-acre organic ranch is known for its award-winning extra virgin olive oil, small-lot wines, and scenic charm. With only a small portion of the land under cultivation, the ranch remains beautifully preserved, making it a peaceful setting for a picnic and tasting experience.

Visitors can explore [olive oil and wine tastings](https://www.mcevoyranch.com/pages/tastings), seasonal culinary pairings, and curated events—all available by appointment. Enjoy a quiet lunch surrounded by vineyards, native gardens, and olive orchards, or take part in a guided tour or workshop when available.

If you're planning a picnic, consider pre-ordering from their seasonal menu to enjoy a locally inspired meal with a glass of their estate wine. The ranch’s commitment to sustainability and thoughtful land stewardship makes every visit feel grounded and intentional.

Reservations are required for all experiences, so be sure to plan ahead.

## Where Nature and History Meet: China Camp State Park

Looking for a scenic, uncrowded picnic spot with a rich cultural backdrop? [China Camp State Park](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/landmarks/china-camp-state-park/), just outside San Rafael, offers a perfect blend of natural beauty and local history. Spanning over 1,600 acres of oak woodlands, grassy meadows, and preserved wetlands, it’s one of the Bay Area’s most peaceful places to enjoy an outdoor meal.

Picnic areas are scattered throughout the park, with views overlooking San Pablo Bay and access to shaded lawns, marshland edges, and sandy shores. The historic China Camp Village is especially charming, with century-old buildings and a small museum. Bring your blanket, your snacks, and your sense of discovery!

In addition to its picnic-perfect day-use areas, the park features 15 miles of multi-use trails for hiking, biking, and horseback riding. For those looking to make a day of it, Buckeye Point, Weber Point, and Bullhead Flat all offer picnic tables, grills, drinking water, and restrooms. Most areas are first-come, first-served, though reservations are available for group sites.

Managed by the nonprofit [Friends of China Camp](https://friendsofchinacamp.org/visit-the-park/day-use-areas/), the park charges a small fee for access. Plan ahead, arrive early on weekends, and enjoy one of Marin’s best-kept outdoor secrets.

## Relax Among Roses at Marin Art and Garden Center

With its serene paths and vibrant blooms, the [Marin Art and Garden Center](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/attractions/landmarks/marin-art-garden-center/) feels like a well-kept secret made for relaxing picnics and quiet exploration. Tucked away on historic land once known as Rancho Punta de Quentin, this lush, 11-acre site has been a cultural landmark for over 75 years—and is now proudly listed on both the National and California Registers of Historic Places.

Wander through beautifully landscaped gardens, stroll shaded pathways, and enjoy quiet picnic moments surrounded by nature and history. The [Picnic Grove](https://maringarden.org/visit-us/) is an exceptionally welcoming spot, offering a tranquil space to relax under the trees. It’s also an ideal setting for slow afternoons, photography, and low-key family time.

Open daily from sunrise to sunset, the grounds are free to visit, and public restrooms are available from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. While the space feels casual and inviting, please keep in mind a few respectful rules: blankets, bikes, and pets aren't allowed on the lawns, and the grounds must be kept clean and peaceful for everyone's enjoyment.

## Sparkling Sips and Sunny Picnics at Heidrun Meadery

Set against a peaceful backdrop in the town of Point Reyes Station, [Heidrun Meadery](https://www.visitmarin.org/culinary/food-and-wine/heidrun-meadery-1-1/) offers a picnic experience that’s as refined as it is relaxed. Known for producing Champagne-style meads using the traditional French méthode champenoise, this charming destination turns honey into a light, crisp, and refreshing drink that pairs perfectly with a slow afternoon outdoors.

Guests are invited to enjoy tastings in the serene garden patio, where tables are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Reservations are recommended, especially for groups or weekend visits, and each visit includes up to 90 minutes to savor the setting.

While the [Essential Tasting flight ($25)](https://www.heidrunmeadery.com/Visit) is a must-try, you can also order mead by the glass or the bottle and enjoy it with a picnic of your own—just no outside alcohol, please. For added convenience, Heidrun offers picnic supplies and curated cheese boxes from nearby Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese. You can also grab something from local favorites on your way.

Bring the kids, leash the pup, and let the day unfold at your own pace—with a bottle of sparkling mead and a view of the hills.

## Bear Valley: A Perfect Pause Before the Trails

Before heading out on the scenic trails of Point Reyes National Seashore, [Bear Valley Picnic Area](https://www.visitmarin.org/outdoor-activities/national-parks-in-marin-county/bear-valley-visitors-center/) offers the perfect place to pause and fuel up. Situated just across from the Bear Valley Visitor Center, this is the park’s largest designated picnic area, offering 25 tables, five family-sized charcoal grills, and ample shade from tall Douglas fir and California bay laurel trees.

You’ll find plenty of practical amenities here too: flush toilets, potable water, and convenient trash and recycling stations. It’s an easy place to gather, whether you're a couple looking for a quiet lunch or a group planning a bigger outdoor event. Just a friendly reminder: groups larger than 25 people will need a permit, and there’s a reservable area available for up to 100 guests..

While you’re here, stop by the [Visitor Center](https://www.nps.gov/places/point-reyes-picnic-area-bear-valley.htm) to grab a trail map, learn about the area’s natural and cultural history, or explore hands-on exhibits like the seismograph and weather station. It's open daily from 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM (closed on Christmas).

Bring your own charcoal or small gas stove if you plan to grill, and be sure to leave the area as you found it—clean, safe, and ready for the next set of visitors.
