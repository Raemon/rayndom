# Italian Film Festival Featuring "Zamora" at Angelico Hall, Dominican University

**Date** : Saturday, October 26, 2024

**Time** : 5:30pm and 8:00pm

[**Website**](https://www.italianfilm.com/index.html)

Presented by Lido Cantarutti, the Italian Film Festival started out as an informal one-time only presentation of Italian movies in a college lecture hall. Now celebrating 46 years, the Italian Film Festival of Marin County is on Saturdays from September 28 - November 2, 2024. Mr. Cantarutti has presnted appearances from Italian film directors and composers, dignitaries of the Italian and Italian-American communities, and an authentically Italian atmosphere at every presentation.   
  
All films are in Italian or original language with subtitles in English. All films are suggested for mature audiences. 

"Zamora" is a 202 comedy in color and lasts 100 minutes.  
Directed by Neri Marcorè, with Alberto Paradossi, Marta Gastini, Neri Marcorè, Giovanni Storti, and Giacomo Poretti

Walter, an accountant at heart and on the job, is forced to transfer from his small town and take a position in a Milan company. The owner, who is passionate about soccer, makes his employees engage in weekly soccer games -- singles against married couples. Walter, who doesn't like soccer, offers to be the goalie. But he allows too many goals, and his colleagues rename him "Zamora", sarcastically comparing him to the great Spanish goalkeeper of the 1930s. Feeling betrayed and embarrassed in front of a love interest, Walter devises an original plan to take revenge! Can he succeed?  
  
Based on the book by Roberto Perrone.  [More details on film festival here](https://www.italianfilm.com/film05.html)
