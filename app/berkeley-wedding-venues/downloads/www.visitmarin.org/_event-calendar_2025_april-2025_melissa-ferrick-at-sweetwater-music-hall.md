# Melissa Ferrick at Sweetwater Music Hall

**Date** : Thursday, April 24, 2025

**Time** : Doors Open at 7:00pm and Show Starts at 8:00pm

[**Website**](https://sweetwatermusichall.org/event/melissa-ferrick/sweetwater-music-hall/mill-valley-california/)

30 years into a prolific career as a genre and gender-defying songwriter, Melissa Ferrick continues to disrupt normative categorization. Indie, Alternative, Folk, Punk….Melissa Ferrick won’t be labeled. With disarming wit and raw vulnerability, every lyric in Ferrick’s immense catalog is an invitation to confession or catharsis. 

In 2023, Ferrick signed with Kill Rock Stars, a label that has long been emblematic of authentic storytelling and home to indie acts including Sleater-Kinney, Bikini Kill, The Decemberists and Elliott Smith.  
  
To commemorate its 25th anniversary, Ferrick has re-recorded her critically acclaimed album Everything I Need. “Just me and the guitar using live takes and no overdubs,” Ferrick captures the emotional intensity that has become a signature of her live performances. “The power songs have on marking time dumbfounds me. I remember writing each of them, I remember recording them, I remember the first time I heard Everything I Need on the radio, and I remember the first time an audience sang along. This album marked a time in my life when I was freed of so many boundaries – some imparted and some I hadn’t been willing to let go.” 

Ferrick’s impact reaches far beyond her music. As one of the few openly queer artists in the 1990s, she navigated and challenged the sexism, homophobia, and rigid gender expectations of the music industry. Her trailblazing journey not only paved the way for future generations of artists but also created a space where they could express their identities and be celebrated on their own terms. Most recently, Melissa launched Drive Music Agency (DMA), a booking agency and consulting company designed to help launch new acts in the indie scene. She is also a Professor of Practice at Northeastern University, teaching courses in music business, songwriting, creative entrepreneurship, demo recording and production, and the psychology of creativity. Melissa was an Associate Professor at Berklee College of Music from 2013 to 2019 and holds an Ed.M. from Harvard University.   
  
Growing up in Ipswich Massachusetts, Ferrick’s passion for music began at an early age. Classically trained in violin and piano, Ferrick’s education is also rooted in jazz, playing both trumpet and bass. As a self-taught guitarist, Ferrick began her career playing local venues in Cambridge like The Middle East and T.T. The Bear’s.. Ferrick’s major breakthrough came in 1991 when she stepped in for Morrissey’s opening act just an hour before showtime. Her impressive performance earned her an invitation to tour with Morrissey in the U.S. and UK, leading to a major label deal with Atlantic Records. Ferrick has shared the stage with countless acts, some of which include Bob Dylan, Joan Armatrading, Weezer, Tegan and Sara, Mark Cohen, Paul Westerberg, John Hiatt, Ani DiFranco, k.d. Lang, Suzanne Vega, and Shawn Colvin. 

General Admission Tickets are $37.60 per person in advance and $42.80 on day of show. All tickets can be purchased in the above website link.
