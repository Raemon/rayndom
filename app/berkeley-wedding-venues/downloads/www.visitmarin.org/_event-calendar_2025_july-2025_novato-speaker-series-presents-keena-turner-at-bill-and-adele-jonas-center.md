# Novato Speaker Series Presents Keena Turner at Bill and Adele Jonas Center

**Date** : Thursday, July 24, 2025

**Time** : 7:00pm - 8:30pm

[**Website**](https://www.novatospeakerseries.com/)

In 1980, Keena was drafted in the second round by the San Francisco 49ers and played outside linebacker with the “Team of the Decade” until his retirement in 1990. His eleven-year contribution to the team resulted in four Super Bowl wins and a trip to the Pro Bowl. He championed the 49ers to victory as Captain of the 1984 team and was subsequently chosen by his teammates as the “Len Eshmont Award” recipient for his courageous and inspirational play.

Keena Turner, legendary #58 and 4-Time SUPER BOWL CHAMPION for the San Francisco 49ers, will join us to discuss sportsmanship, teamwork, the championship mindset and what it took to win and sustain dominance during his eleven-year professional football career. Now, Vice President and Senior Advisor to the General Manager, Keena will field questions about his “Team of the Decade” and the future of today’s Niners squad.

In-Person Tickets are $15.00 for students and $30.00 for adults. All tickets can be purchased in the above website link.
