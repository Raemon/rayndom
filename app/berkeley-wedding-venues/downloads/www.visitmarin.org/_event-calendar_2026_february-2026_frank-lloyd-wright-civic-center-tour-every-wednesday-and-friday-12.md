# Frank Lloyd Wright Civic Center Tour (Every Wednesday and Friday)

**Date** : Wednesday, February 18, 2026

**Time** : Wednesday at 1:00pm and Friday at 10:30am

[**Website**](https://tickets.marincenter.org/eventperformances.asp?evt=182)

Join us for a docent-led behind-the-scenes tour of the Marin County Civic Center designed by renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The Marin County Civic Center (1957) is one of the last major works of Wright’s career and his only realized project for a government entity.   
  
During this 90-minute walking tour, you’ll get access to the Marin County Board of Supervisors Chambers and their private balcony, you’ll be eye level with the building’s iconic blue roof, you’ll see custom furniture designed Frank Lloyd Wright and built by inmates from San Quentin’s wood shop, and you’ll learn the complicated and scandalous history of the creation of the building from specially trained docents.   
  
Widely considered to be the greatest American architect of the 20th century, Wright’s innovative design of the Marin County Civic Center dramatically illustrates the kinship of architecture to the surrounding landscape with long horizontal buildings that gracefully link the crowns of three separate hills.   
  
Docent-led tours are offered every Wednesday at 1:00pm and Friday at 10:30am starting in the Civic Center Cafeteria (Room 233). Pre-purchased tickets are required. Guests should be prepared to walk/stand for 90 minutes. The tour covers approximately one mile in total distance.  
  
Ticket prices are featured below and can be purchased in the above website link.

Adult - $12.00; Senior (65+) - $7.00; Full Time Student / Youth (5-17) - $7.00; all tickets include fees.
