[**Website**](https://ci.ovationtix.com/35892/performance/11502270?performanceId=11502270)

Prepare to be transported to the era of Go-go boots and British rock legends! The Minks are a dynamic all-female tribute band dedicated to capturing the spirit of one of the most influential and beloved British bands – The Kinks.  
  
“The Kinks, but less ladylike." Based in San Francisco and Los Angeles, this talented group of ladies infuse their energy and style into The Kinks' timeless hits spanning the 60s to the 80s. Get ready to dance to classics such as Lola, You Really Got Me, Destroyer, and Sunny Afternoon.  
  
Since their formation in 2009, The Minks have become a fixture on the Bay Area music scene and beyond, playing clubs, festivals, corporate events, and even wowing crowds at the Musikfest festival in Bethlehem, PA. The Minks lineup features original members Jenny Edwards on lead vocals, Allison Bennett on guitar, and Linda Palermo on keys alongside a new ferocious rhythm section with Christina Michelle on bass (Chick Jagger, The Fog City Swampers) and Geri Vahey on drums (The Seagulls, Skint).  
  
Don't miss your chance to experience The Minks, the ultimate tribute to The Kinks. Whether you're a die-hard Kinks fan or just looking for a night of infectious rock and roll, we've got you covered. Join us for a journey through rock history you won't soon forget!

Tickets are $29.00 per person and is for admission and music only. Dinner reservations are recommended between 6:00pm - 8:00pm. All tickets can be purchased in the above website link.
