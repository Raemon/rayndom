# Visit the Wild-est Side of Marin County

Posted in [Blogging Marin](/tools/blog-categories/blogging-marin/) on Friday, February 17, 2023 by MCVB Staff

**TOTAL IMMERSION IN MARIN COUNTY’S WILD-EST SIDE**

A trip to Marin County can be a wildlife safari adventure and being just a short drive from San Francisco, it has remained a hub of natural beauty and rich wildlife. With its diverse landscapes, including rolling hills, forests, pristine coastlines, and offshore islands, Marin presents a special chance for nature lovers to see the wonder of wildlife in its natural setting.

The rolling hills and forests of Marin are also home to a diverse range of terrestrial wildlife, including the black-tailed deer, the gray fox, and several species of birds. A great time to visit [Marin is in the spring](https://www.visitmarin.org/blog/spring-in-marin-collection/marin-in-full-bloom-the-best-floral-photo-and-instagram-ops/), when the hills burst with colorful wildflowers, luring a variety of birds like the Western Bluebird, Black-chinned Hummingbird, and American Goldfinch.

One of the best ways to experience the beauty of Marin's wildlife is to take a guided [wildflower walk](https://www.visitmarin.org/blog/spring-in-marin-collection/). Visitors can join a [group hike](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/tours/walking-tours/) or opt for a self-guided walk along one of the many trails in Marin. The trails offer stunning views of the hills and coastline, as well as an opportunity to see a variety of wildflowers, including the California poppy, the golden lupine, and the Farewell to Spring.

If you are in the mood for a wildlife **Safari Tour** in Marin, you’ve come to the right place. [Point Reyes National Seashore](https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/nature/animals.htm) is famous for its abundant wildlife. Visit the Tule Elk Reserve, watch whales from Chimney Rock on their annual migration, or find yourself at Elephant Seal Overlook during mating season. Speaking of “[Wildlife”](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/wildlife/) a visit here from December through March is the best time to sneak a peek at these Elephant seals and their pups on Drake’s Beach. Elephant seals are aquatic mammals and have been coming to Marin since the 1970s. Watch quietly, whisper, and move slowly. Elephant seals can be shy, and yet sometimes aggressive.

Grab your binoculars or camera and book a tour with [Point Reyes Safaris](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/tours/guided-tours/point-reyes-safaris-1/) where “Wild is Waiting” to be photographed by you. Naturalist photographer, Daniel Dietrich, and his team will help you locate the best of the best to bring home those memorable pictures of elk, fox, coyote, Bobcat, raptors, owls, and the list goes on...

For guided tours of**Marin’s natural wildlife** and landscape, take a kayak tour with [Tomales Bay Expeditions](https://www.tomalesbayexpeditions.com/tours/). A very unique way to experience nature is on the open water in a kayak, especially on a three-hour night tour with their experienced guides! Tomales Bay has become well known recently as a great place to see planktonic bioluminescence at night, and aside from some fabulous star gazing, perhaps you’ll see some nocturnal predators such as owls. Explore other adventures on your own with a kayak rented from [Blue Waters Kayaking](https://www.visitmarin.org/things-to-do/tours/water-sport-tours/blue-waters-kayaking-1/) located in Point Reyes.

**JUST A LITTLE OUT THERE IN MARIN...**

The [Marin Islands National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/marin-islands), which was established in 1909, is a crucial habitat for a variety of seabirds, marine mammals, and other wildlife species. Over 300,000 seabirds, including several threatened and endangered species like the [Western Gull](https://farallones.org/sanctuary-wildlife/birds/) and the Ashy Storm-Petrel, find refuge on the islands. During the months of December through May, you can see thousands of whales pass by the islands on their way to and from their breeding grounds in Mexico. The refuge also provides a chance to observe the gray whale migration.

The Gulf of the [Farallones National Marine Sanctuary](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/farallon-islands), located just off the coast of Marin, is a rich marine ecosystem that supports a wide variety of wildlife. The sanctuary is a critical habitat for several species of whales, dolphins, and seals, as well as several species of seabirds, including the tufted puffin and the pelagic cormorant. For a chance to see these magnificent animals in their natural environment, tourists can go on a whale-watching tour.

Whether you’re visiting for the flowers or the animals, Marin County always has something for everyone. For more information, you can always contact us [here](https://www.visitmarin.org/contact-us/).
