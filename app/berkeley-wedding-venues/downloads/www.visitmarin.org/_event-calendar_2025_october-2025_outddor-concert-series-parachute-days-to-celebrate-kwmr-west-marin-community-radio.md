# Outdoor Community Concert Series "Parachute Days" to Celebrate KWMR West Marin Community Radio

**Date** : Sunday, October 12, 2025

**Time** : 2:00pm - 7:00pm

A a celebrated outdoor community concert series will return to downtown Point Reyes Station for a special cause: local radio. Parachute Days x KWMR: A Fundraiser for West Marin Community Radio is an all-ages, family-friendly concert in the parking lot of Toby’s Feed Barn, featuring indie rock, honky-tonk, and a high school mariachi band, plus oysters, tacos, and refreshments, from 2 p.m. until 7 p.m.. Sliding scale tickets start at $20 and will be sold at the door.  
  
Founded in spring 2016 by local artist Gabe Korty, Parachute Days was envisioned as an outdoor collaborative arts space beneath a billowing parachute tent with music, visual and performance arts, libations, dancing, and communal joy. After a six year hiatus during the pandemic, the series returns with a grant from the Pirkle Jones Fund with performances by three local acts that reflect the cultural spectrum of West Marin: George-ish Jones-like, Mariachi Lobos De Elsie Allen High School, and Good Friends. A post-concert after party will be held at the Old Western Saloon across the street, with funky retro beats spun by DJ Barbarella, former host of KWMR’s wildly popular, “Barbarian Beach Party.” 

Sliding scale tickets for adults start at $20 and will be sold at the gate only. Youth 12 - 18 are $10, and under 11 and under are free. The event is happening right in the parking lot downtown.

Bring a low folding chair, an appetite, your hat, sun screen, and a refillable water container and don’t forget your dancing shoes!
