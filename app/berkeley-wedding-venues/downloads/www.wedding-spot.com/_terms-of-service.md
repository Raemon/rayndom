Last updated Jan 12, 2021

  
  


Cvent, Inc., doing business as Wedding Spot ("Wedding Spot", "we", "us", "our") provides its services (described below) to you through its website located at [www.wedding-spot.com](https://www.wedding-spot.com/) (the "Site") and through its mobile applications and related services (collectively, such services, including any new features and applications, and the Site, the "Service(s)"), subject to the following Terms of Service (as amended from time to time, the "Terms of Service"). Your use of the Service(s) constitutes acceptance of these Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms of Service are made a part of and are incorporated into any Wedding Spot insertion order (“Order”) signed by Vendors (as defined below) unless otherwise expressly stated on such Order. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms of Service at any time. If we do this, we will post the changes on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. We will also notify you, either through the Services user interface, in an email notification or through other reasonable means. Any such changes will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) days after they are posted, except that changes addressing new functions of the Services or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. Your continued use of the Service after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. 

In addition, when using certain services, you will be subject to any additional terms applicable to such services that may be posted on the Service from time to time, including, without limitation, the Privacy Policy located at www.weddingspot.com/privacy/. All such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. 

1\. Access and Use of the Service

1.1 Services Description: The Service is a platform connecting people seeking wedding services ("Clients") to our community of vendors who provide wedding venues and related services ("Vendors") (Clients and Vendors are "Users", "you" and "your"). Please be advised: Although Wedding Spot administers the Service (including price estimates and comparison features) and allows Clients to search for Vendors on our Site, Wedding Spot is not otherwise a party to the Vendor services or any other transactions that may take place between Clients and Vendors and is not involved in or responsible for the performance of any services provided by Vendors. Wedding Spot has no control over the performance of any service by Vendors or any claims made by Vendors about the venue or services they may offer, nor does Wedding Spot guarantee or endorse the truth or accuracy of any representations made by Vendors, the ability of Vendors to provide the venue or services as claimed by Vendors (even if through the Service) or the ability of Clients to pay for any venue or services offered by Vendors. Clients and Vendors (and not Wedding Spot) bear all risks and liabilities associated with any vendor services, venues or other transactions between them. Different sections of the Site and Terms of Service may affect Clients and Vendors differently, so please be sure to read all terms carefully. 

1.2 Relationship of Users: All Users acknowledge and understand that Wedding Spot is not an employer, broker, agent or insurer for any Users of the Service. Wedding Spot's acceptance of a Vendor to the Service should not be construed as or otherwise deemed an endorsement or promotion of such Vendor, and such acceptance is in reliance on the Vendor's representation and warranty to Wedding Spot of the accuracy of information submitted by such Vendor. As the Service solely provides a platform and tools for Users to communicate with potential transaction partners, any such transactions are made by all Users at each User's own risk. 

1.3 Your Registration Obligations: You may be required to register with Wedding Spot in order to access and use certain features of the Service. If you choose to register for the Service, you agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form. Registration data and certain other information about you are governed by our Privacy Policy. If you are under 13 years of age, you are not authorized to use the Service, with or without registering. In addition, if you are under 18 years old, you may use the Service, with or without registering, only with the approval of your parent or guardian. 

1.4 Member Account, Password and Security: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, if any, and are fully responsible for any and all activities, with or without your knowledge, that occur under your password or account. You will take reasonable precautions to protect against theft, loss or fraudulent use of such password and account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Wedding Spot of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session when accessing the Service. Wedding Spot will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section. 

1.5 Modifications to Service: Access is limited to the version of the Service in Wedding Spot’s production environment. Wedding Spot reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, add and/or substitute functionally equivalent features in the event of end-of-life or changes to software requirements, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that Wedding Spot will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service. 

1.6 General Practices Regarding Use and Storage: You acknowledge that Wedding Spot may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Service, including without limitation the maximum period of time that data or other content will be retained by the Service and the maximum storage space that will be allotted on Wedding Spot's servers on your behalf.

To the extent you access the Service through a mobile device, your wireless service carrier's standard charges, data rates and other fees may apply. In addition, downloading, installing, or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your carrier, and not all Mobile Services may work with all carriers or devices. By using the Mobile Services, you agree that we may communicate with you regarding Wedding Spot and other entities by SMS, MMS, text message or other electronic means to your mobile device and that certain information about your usage of the Mobile Services may be communicated to us.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.

Wedding Spot reserves the right to suspend or terminate a Vendor's and any Vendor affiliates' access to and/or use of the Site for any accounts (i) for which any payment is due but unpaid.

Payment shall be by check unless otherwise specified on your Order Form or Invoice. Except where prohibited by applicable laws, if Vendor pays any fees due hereunder via credit or debit card, then Wedding Spot reserves the right to charge Vendor a surcharge of three percent (3%) of the total amount due hereunder, and Vendor hereby consents to such charge being made against the credit or debit card provided by Vendor. If you dispute any charges you must let Wedding Spot know within thirty (30) days after receipt of invoice, provided that you will promptly pay the undisputed portion of the invoice and will only withhold payment of the disputed portion until the dispute is resolved.

h. Renewal Eligibility. If any payment is past due or in arrears, Vendor will not be eligible for renewal until all payments are made current. 

i. Change in existing Vendor profile. To the extent an existing Vendor profile listed on Wedding Spot Site undergoes any change in ownership (whether in the case of a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all assets), Vendor re-branding, brand transitions or conversions, and/or a Vendor changes their location address(es) listed on our Site, the Vendor will be required to upgrade their venue listing by paying the amount specified in the payment plan in order for Wedding Spot to facilitate the changes to the Vendor’s profile.
