Wedding Spot: An idea so obvious it should already have been invented

“ In Silicon Valley, if you've got a good idea chances are someone has already tried to build it. 

If they haven't, it's probably because it's a tricky problem to tackle. But every once in awhile, there's a diamond in the rough - an idea so obvious that it's not totally clear why no one has built it yet. That's the case with newly launched Wedding Spot.”

Startup aims to be ‘kayak.com for the wedding industry’

“ It's the beginning of peak wedding planning season and one San Francisco-based startup is taking the cake for solving prospective brides' most troubling issue - finding a wedding venue. 

Aiming to be the Kayak.com for the wedding industry, Wedding Spot is a new online tool that helps fiancés and fiancées search, compare & book wedding venues by category. So for a bride who has always dreamed of having a whimsical wedding on a ranch, the site allows her to search for that specific venue, gather all the information on pricing and available dates and \- if it's a fit - sets her up with an appointment.”

Entrepreneur Uses Technology to Make Wedding Planning More Transparent

“ For most people, planning a wedding is incredibly stressful, and it all starts with finding that perfect venue. 

Prior to Wedding Spot, there were many sites with a ton of information about wedding venues, but none of them answered the most important question - what would it cost to have a wedding there? Couples would have to email, call or even visit venues just to get a basic wedding information packet with rental fees. Imagine having to do this for six to seven hundred venues in your area of interest. Sounds terrifying, right? Wedding Spot was created to solve this precise problem that's been frustrating brides for decades.”
