# Bringing Transparency to the Wedding Industry.

Launched in late August of 2013, Wedding Spot is the first online site that allows you to search, price, and compare wedding venues. Working directly with venues, Wedding Spot gathers all the information required to enable you to easily search for venues based on budget, location, style, and guest count. Then "build out" your ideal wedding day by selecting specific services and options to see a price estimate. And lastly, book an appointment with one click of a button to view the venue if it fits your budget. We take the stress out of wedding planning by allowing soon-to-be brides and grooms to get the information that they need without having to pick up the phone once or track down a single wedding information packet. 

We currently list over 13,000 venues across the US. We have helped over 7 million couples with their wedding planning needs, and we want to help millions more. 

Wedding Spot is based in the SOMA District of San Francisco, CA.
