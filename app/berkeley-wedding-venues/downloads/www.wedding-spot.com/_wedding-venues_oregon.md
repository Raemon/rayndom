  * Marriage Officiant: In Oregon, a couple can be married by a judge, justice of the peace, or authorized religious official. Couples can also be married by a friend or family member who has been granted a one-time authorization by the state to perform the ceremony. The officiant must sign and return the marriage license to the county clerk's office within five days of the ceremony.
