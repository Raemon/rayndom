# Wedding Spot, Inc. FAQ

Last updated January 8, 2020

#### What is Wedding Spot?

Wedding Spot is the first website to allow users to search, price, and compare wedding venues side-by-side. We work closely with venues and their vendors to gather their pricing options which allows you to know the estimated cost of having your event at a particular venue before contacting their venue coordinator for additional details. 

#### I’m looking for a venue, how can I sign up for Wedding Spot?

To get started, simply create an account by clicking “Sign In” in the top right corner of your screen. After creating an account, you can save venues and Spot Estimates to your favorites so you’re able to access them at a later time. 

#### Does Wedding Spot have venues for rehearsal dinners and bridal showers?

Yes, we currently have directories in Atlanta, Chicago, and Manhattan that showcase venues for rehearsal dinners and bridal showers. We will be adding more directories soon so stay tuned! If you are a venue coordinator and are interested in listing your venue as a rehearsal dinner/bridal shower event space, please inquire with [sales@wedding-spot.com](mailto:sales@wedding-spot.com). 

#### What is the budget range that is provided on the search results page?

We provide a budget range for each venue based on your filtered guest count on the search results page. The low end of the range represents a more budget friendly wedding with bare minimum options and Sunday rental fees. The high end of the range represents a higher-end wedding with upgraded options and Saturday rental fees. This is also applicable for “BYO” (bring your own) venues which do not provide catering and/or alcohol. For BYO venues, our system takes the average cost of catering in your area and includes it in the estimate range shown on the search results page. If you select the guest filter of “up to 100”, you will see that the budget range provided is for 100 guests. If you select “up to 200” in the guest filter, you will see that the budget ranges have increased because it is now for 200 guests.

#### What is a Spot Estimate?

A Spot Estimate is an estimate of the bare minimum budget that is required based on your selected options and requirements. You may change certain amenities, equipment rentals, guest count and/or menu and beverage selections to change the estimated price to better target your price-point. While the Spot Estimate includes estimates for venue rental fees, amenities, equipment rentals and food and beverage costs, it is not an all-inclusive price estimate for your entire wedding. The Spot Estimate does not include the cost of outside vendors such as photographers, videographers, DJ’s, florists, and other non-venue related vendors.

#### Can I book my wedding with the prices provided by Wedding Spot in the Spot Estimate?

While we work closely with venues and their vendors to provide pricing estimates, they may not be 100% accurate and prices are always subject to change based on availability and time of booking. In addition, the estimates we provide are starting prices and there are many add-on options, so please be sure to confirm pricing with the venue.

#### How can I compare budgets and prices for my favorite venues?

To compare your favorite venues, you need to first complete a Spot Estimate for each venue you’re interested in. Once you have done this, access your Spot Estimates by clicking “My Account” in the top corner of your screen or by using this [link](https://www.wedding-spot.com/myaccount/spot-estimates). You can select up to 3 venues to compare and we will provide a side-by-side comparison view!
