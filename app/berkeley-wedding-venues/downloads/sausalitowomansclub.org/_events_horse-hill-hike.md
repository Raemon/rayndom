# HORSE HILL HIKE

June 9 @ 9:00 am \- 2:00 pm

Tuesday, June 9, 2026 | 9:00am – Meet at SWC to carpool 

We’ll close out the hiking season with a local favorite—a 4.5-mile loop through Mill Valley’s Escalon Fire Road and Camino Alto Bowl. The trail climbs gradually up the ridge, rewarding us with views of Horse Hill to (hopefully) meet its grazing equine residents. This scenic and gentle hike is perfect for ending the season on a high note. Lunch to follow at The Cantina, a lively spot nearby. RSVP by 6/6 to Co-leaders Kathy Atkins-Page and Helen Bennett.
