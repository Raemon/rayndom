# LANDS END HIKE

September 18, 2025 @ 9:00 am \- 1:00 pm

![](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/landend-1.jpg)

Thursday, September 18, 2025 | 9:00 am – Meet at SWC to carpool

Back by popular demand! This famous but not well known SF city trail goes from the fancy Seacliff residential area to the old Cliff House. It follows through secluded beaches with coastal views overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. We will explore the old Sutro Baths, Mile Rock Beach, and Eagle Point. There will be an option for a slower 3 mile walk or a faster 5 plus mile hike. Lunch to follow at the Beach Chalet nearby. 

RSVP by 9/15 to Co-leaders Helen Bennett and Kathy Atkins-Page.
