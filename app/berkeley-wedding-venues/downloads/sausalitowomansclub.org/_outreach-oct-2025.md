# OUTREACH OCT 2025

by [saus94965](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/author/saus94965/ "Posts by saus94965") | Sep 29, 2025 | [Committee Reports](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/category/committee-reports/)

Can you believe it’s October already?

This year is flying by, and fall is filling up with events, fundraisers, and festivities.Amidst it allare our members who sometimes need rides, check-in phone calls, or an occasional home-cooked meal. It’s gratifying to know that we have a network within the SWC to provide these services.

I want to take a moment to acknowledge the longtime efforts of former Outreach Chair MaryKae Krause, who recently moved from Sausalito to The Redwoods in Mill Valley. MaryKae remains an active committee member, and we are grateful for her healthcare experience, computer savvy, and extensive local network of resources.

As always, if you or any SWC member you know needs assistance, please contact Outreach Committee Chair Debbie Ford-Scriba at [dfordscriba@gmail.com](mailto:dfordscriba@gmail.com) or 408.666.9090. All inquiries are confidential unless otherwise noted.Happy Fall!
