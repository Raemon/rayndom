# GROUNDS OCT 2025

by [saus94965](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/author/saus94965/ "Posts by saus94965") | Sep 29, 2025 | [Committee Reports](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/category/committee-reports/)

**Grounds Committee Update**

The pots and urns were refreshed with seasonal plantings to celebrate both the fall holidays and our recent Welcome Back Party. A big thank you to Sherrie Faber (a.k.a. “Pot Lady”) for keeping our pots and urns filled with beautiful seasonal flowers that brighten the club’s entryway.

Looking ahead, the committee is considering replacing the bark chips on the left side of the building with smooth gray rocks. This improvement would enhance fire safety while also complementing our beautiful Craftsman-style clubhouse.

Wishing everyone a wonderful fall season!
