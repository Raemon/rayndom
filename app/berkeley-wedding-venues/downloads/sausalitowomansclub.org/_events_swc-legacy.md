# SWC LEGACY

March 26, 2025 @ 5:00 pm \- 7:00 pm

![](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SWC-Legacy-Logo-2025.png)

**What will be YOUR Legacy for the Sausalito Woman’s Club?**

Please join us for an enriching evening featuring a panel discussion with a financial advisor and estate/trust attorney. The evening will commence with a signature legacy “Kir Royale Cocktail” and light hors d’oeuvres. This will be followed by a panel discussion focused on estate giving. We will explore the most effective ways to contribute to all three branches of the club: The SWC Preservation Society, the SWC Scholarship Recognition Fund and the SWC CLUB itself.

The evening promises to be an informative and enlightening experience that will guide you in shaping a meaningful legacy.

Free Event.

Please RSVP by 3/19 by email to Holly Stewart: [holly@hollystewart.com](mailto:holly@hollystewart.com)

Thank you and we look forward to seeing you on March 26th!
