# Walk & Hiking: Coit Tower / North Beach Urban Hike

February 24, 2025 @ 8:00 am \- 5:00 pm

![Coit Tower / North Beach Urban Hike](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/a8e16cb2-c34c-49f2-bbac-98dad1de9c97_san-francisco-urban-hike-coit-tower-lombard-street-and-north-beach-large.webp)

**Coit Tower / North Beach Urban Hike**  
8:15am Meet at Sausalito Ferry  
Starting at the Ferry Building, we’ll stroll down the Embarcadero to the famous Filbert Street stairs, taking our time to enjoy the flora and fauna while keeping an eye out for the parrots of Telegraph Hill. After the steep ascent, we’ll be rewarded with a spectacular view at the top. From there, we’ll descend Greenwich Street to Grant Avenue, enjoying some shopping along the way, before having lunch at the renowned Sotto Mare restaurant. Afterward, we’ll continue down Grant Street through North Beach and return to the Ferry Building. We’ll catch the 2:40pm ferry back to Sausalito, with an optional 4:20 pm ferry for those who wish to stay longer.

RSVP by February 20th to co-leaders Nancy Curran or Sandy Strawbridge
