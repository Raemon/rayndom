# Zero Waste

## Zero Waste – Supplemental Information

**1\. Zero Waste Guidelines – what to do with compost/recycling/waste**

Guidelines (rev 10 2016) are posted

  * In the SWC Kitchen
  * On the SWC web under the ‘Community’ tab



**2\. Single use Compostable tableware – stocked in the basement**

  * The most sustainable practice – use existing tableware
  * When you want disposable tableware Simplify your cleanup – make it all compostable
  * These compostable items are in the basement: wood utensils, paper plates and paper cups We are not stocking paper napkins
  * Please call Sustainability Co-Chairs, if supplies are low, or you have questions



**3\. Fascinating Facts About Paper Products**

  * Paper products may be composted or recycled – use your judgment If paper has a little oil or food residue (example: a pizza box or napkin) Recycle – if mostly dry / Compost – if wet or food filled
  * Paper plates and cups lined with a Coating On 1 Side Only are compostable In Sausalito only (nowhere else Marin) If mostly clean, recycle / if food soiled, compost. For big events – do the easy thing and put all paper in compost
  * Chinet Paper Plates – are made of 100% recycled paper 100% recycled paper supports the recycling process Chinet is easily available at Safeway Use two plates, when you need a thicker/sturdier plate



**4\. Sustainability Starts At The Store**

  * What you buy, determines what the manufacture makes: Your $ is your vote.
  * We encourage you to only buy milk and juice in plastic or glass containers All cartons with plastic tops (screw tops, flip tops, straws) are trash Cartons with ‘pinch’ tops may be recycled with paper (let the recycler evaluate)
  * Caution: Many items labeled ‘100% compostable’ or ‘biodegradable’ – DON’T COMPOST Buy these if you want to avoid petroleum plastics, but for now – most go in landfill.
  * Call us if you want us to research a product for you. What composts? This depends upon where your hauler* takes your compost – facilities have different capabilities. Plus, the composition of products change, and facilities upgrade, so efforts on all sides are improving all the time; and this means change.



**What recycles?**

Glass, Metal and Aluminum recycle endlessly.

Both Paper & Plastic have fibers that shorten and degrade with each recycling:

Paper recycles between 4 – 6 times. Composting ends the recycling loop.  
Plastic 7-9 times.

**When In Doubt, Recycle** – per Greg Christie, **B** ay **C** ities **R** efuse **S** ervice, Sausalito’s hauler*
