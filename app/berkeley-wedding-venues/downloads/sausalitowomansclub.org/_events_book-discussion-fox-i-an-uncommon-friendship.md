Fox & I: An Uncommon Friendship by Catherine Raven is a beautifully written, wise, and intimate memoir, by a biologist about what she learned from a wild fox. Nature writing at its best! “I learned as much about the meaning of friendship from this book as I have from any work of nonfiction I’ve ever read.” NYT review. Discussant Julie Carlson.
