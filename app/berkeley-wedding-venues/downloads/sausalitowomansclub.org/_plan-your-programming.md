# PROGRAMS 

If you would like to announce your event at the upcoming Business Meeting, please let SWC Program Co-Chairs Renee Maher & Tia Hensler know beforehand. Otherwise, the program chairs will announce your event.

If you are hosting an event on-site, pay close attention to clean-up procedures. We suggest that you assemble a set-up and a clean-up committee.

Thank you for hosting a program to enrich the lives of our community of women!
