![](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Untitled-2.jpg)

Sunday, October 12 – 1:00 – 4:00 pm

Ever wondered why the Scandinavian countries always make it to the list of Top 10 Happiest Countries?! The smörgåsbord is definitely one of those reasons! It’s the camaraderie of friends, traditional foods, singing and drinking aquavit. If pickled herring, gravlaks and mackerel are things that make you drool, join us as we teach you the ways of eating and drinking at a real smörgåsbord. Culinary Committee Event.

Limit 25. $30. Purchase tickets by 9/20  
Chairs Shari Hansen, Annette Brinton.
