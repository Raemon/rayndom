# PRESIDIO LOOP HIKE

April 20 @ 8:30 am \- 2:00 pm

Monday, April 20, 2026 | 8:45am – Meet at SWC to carpool 

Explore our local National Park gem – the Presidio – on this beautiful 5.5 mile loop starting at Tunnel Tops Park. We’ll walk to Inspiration Point, continue past the Golf Course, Mountain Lake, and the former Public Health Service Hospital to the coastal bluff above Baker Beach. Our route will then take us to the southern end of the Golden Gate Bridge down to Crissy Field and back to the starting point. This hike blends coastal views, natural beauty, and rich military history. We’ll enjoy a picnic lunch from Il Parco at the scenic Tunnel Tops park overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge and Sausalito. 

RSVP by 4/17 to Co-leaders Jennifer Gridley and Karen Wilcox.
