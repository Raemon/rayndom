# BOOK DISCUSSION: James

January 15 @ 4:00 pm \- 6:00 pm

![](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/James.jpg)

January 15, 2026, at 4pm

Re imagining The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the novel James by Percival Everett gives voice to Jim, exploring race, freedom, and humanity through his eyes. Witty, sharp, and deeply moving, this novel invites us to reconsider a classic American tale from a radically new and necessary perspective. Join us to unpack layers of satire, sorrow, and strength. Discussant Fran Nelson.
