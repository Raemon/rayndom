# READING ROOM SUNDAY

October 26, 2025 @ 2:00 pm \- 4:00 pm

![](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/readingroomsunday.png)

Sunday, October 26, 2:00 – 4:00 pm

Join Rose Waldman (voice) and Robby Stafford (voice and piano) as they journey through the 1910s, ’20s, ’30s, and ’40s by way of the popular standards of those decades. These years saw the world from the end of the belle epoque and late industrial revolution through World War I, the Roaring ’20s, the Great Depression, and World War II. The chaos and excitement of this era are reflected in the rapidly-changing landscape of its popular music. This music evolved out of classical and folk traditions into something that had broad mass appeal for its jazzy rhythms and hummable tunes. Featuring classics from Cole Porter, George Gershwin, and more, these songs are as fun to sing as they are to listen to for audiences of all ages. Come for the history, stay for the melody, and leave tapping your feet.
