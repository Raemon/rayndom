# FULL MOON HIKE TO KIRBY COVE

October 6, 2025 @ 5:30 pm \- 9:00 pm

![](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/kirby-cove-hike-1.jpg)

Monday, October 6, 2025 | 5:30pm – Meet at the Kirby Cove trailhead 

SWC members, family, and friends are invited to our annual evening hike to Kirby Cove. It’s an easy 1.8 mile descent down to the shore through a forested cove, with stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge and SF skyline. We’ll all enjoy a picnic at communal tables while the moon rises over the Golden Gate and then we’ll hike back in the moonlight. Please bring your own picnic and beverages. Ample parking is available on Conzelman Road. Disabled access to the site is available with advanced notice. RSVP by 10/3 to Co-leaders Dana Whitson and Margo Merle.
