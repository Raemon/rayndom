# GROUNDS

by [saus94965](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/author/saus94965/ "Posts by saus94965") | Aug 31, 2025 | [Committee Reports](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/category/committee-reports/), [Newsletter](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/category/newsletter/)

Greetings from the Garden Committee!

This summer has focused on maintaining our garden and thoughtfully adding plantings that reflect Julia Morgan’s aesthetic. Many years ago, Carol Raisbeck—a dedicated member and landscape architect—researched and designed our gardens to embody Julia Morgan’s distinctive style and era. In the 1980s, Carol’s late husband Cliff constructed the craftsman-style bench in the back garden, complementing our building’s architecture.

Carol advocated for incorporating numerous evergreens and exclusively white flowering plants in our gardens. Honoring her vision and recent recommendations, we have introduced additional white-flowering varieties, such as “Dwarf Snowball Agapanthus” and two types of white English Lavender, “Arctic Snow” and “Elegance Ice,” I discovered at the lavender farm in Half Moon Bay. These additions will enhance the sensory experience around the front patio with their fragrance.

Earlier this summer, I replanted the containers with striking whites and evergreens, as well as trailing succulents, taking into consideration the weddings scheduled throughout the season.

We gratefully acknowledge Sloat Garden Center for consistently supporting SWC, contributing approximately $700 annually toward perennial plants for our planters. The Fall-to-Winter plantings for our containers will once again be provided thanks to Sloat’s generosity. We encourage members to share their appreciation for these donations when visiting any of their locations.
