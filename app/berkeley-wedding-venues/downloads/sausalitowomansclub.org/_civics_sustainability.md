![](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sustainable-Sat.png)

Learn about the health benefits of reusables and the toxic chemicals in single-use foodware from Eva Holman, the co-founder of Goods Holding Company, a San Francisco based small business that invented a [bulk buying system](http://www.goodsholdingcompany.com/), which includes jars with the tare weight (in ounces, pounds, and grams) printed right on the side of the jar.

Eva works with bay area cities on reusable foodware policies for restaurants and in schools. She worked with the city of San Francisco to pass policies banning PFAS, straws, styrofoam, plastic water bottles, and disposable plastic foodware. She is writing a vegan and low climate impact cookbook of family friendly and plastic free recipes.

RSVP by 10/1 to: Co-Chair J[ulie Carlson](http://carlson.juli@gmail.com) & Laurie Tandy, Sustainability Committee.

## **We were asked recently  
What is Sustainability?**

SWC’s Sustainability Committee was formed in an effort to help us

  * understand how to reach Marin Counties Joint Powers Agreement (JPA) Zero Waste Goals by 2025
  * what to compost and why composting is so important
  * what to recycle



This is still our main focus, because while many people have responded to these basic community goals, it can still be confusing and elusive.

**Trash – Zero Waste by 2025**  
Every day 1,000 tons of garbage is deposited at the Redwood Landfill in north Novato. According to Redwood Landfill’s District Manager, the landfill will be filled to its current capacity (26 million cubic yards) by 2025. In 2012, it was filled to 17 million cubic yards and the rate of disposal has skyrocketed. Marin County generates the most garbage per capita of any county in the country.

**Compost – Why you should**  
Trashed food waste goes to landfill where it generates, methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Methane emissions are significantly reduced by composting food waste. Composting yard and food wastes creates a product that can be used to help improve soils, help sink carbon, grow the next generation of crops, and improve water quality.

**Recycle – SWC and Bay Cities Refuse Guidelines**  
See the Club guidelines posted on SWC’s site under the Community tab.  
Refer to BCRS guidelines [**VIEW VIDEO**](http://www.baycitiesrefuse.com/bcr/recycling-organics-collection/)

**Sustainability Defined – to supply current needs without compromising future generations.**  
In Environmental Science, Sustainability is the quality of not being harmful to the environment or depleting natural resources, and thereby supporting long-term ecological balance necessary for continued human civilization and existence – capacity for the biosphere and human civilization to coexist. [**VIEW VIDEO**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmQby7adocM)

**Why we all need to participate**  
**If we have learned anything from the Pandemic, it is that we are all in this together.**  
_“The answers to the biggest challenges of our time come not from government and business, but from you and me, from_ _communities working together. If we wait for governments, it will be too late. If we act as individuals, it will be too little._  
_But if we act as communities, it might just be enough, and it might just be in time.”_  
**From What Is To What If** , by Bob Hopkins

In tough times we remember, that we each have the capacity to amplify what is useful, good, and beautiful in our world.

From your Sustainability Committee:  
Julie Carlson, Sue Currier, Shari Hansen, Jann Johnson, Laurie Tandy, Dana Whitson

Motivate our Leaders — Take Personal Actions — Encourage Others

Climate change is an immediate existential threat of unprecedented magnitude. Support statewide mobilization for a climate-safe future  
<https://theclimatecenter.org/dec-4-2019>

“We can all do one thing.”  
Niklas, a College of Marin student  
San Rafael student’s Strike for the Climate, November 2019

He said: So just pick one thing — whether it’s eating less meat, converting to LED’s, riding your bike, buying sustainable clothing or supporting legislation — and actually do it. Maybe then you’ll think change is possible, or you’ll think, “That wasn’t so hard,” and then maybe you could do another thing.  
Maybe it will reduce your carbon footprint or cause less pollution.

He said: Any first action will guide you to your next steps. Possibly the best first step is simply talking to people. You will be surprised how much easier making impactful change becomes.
