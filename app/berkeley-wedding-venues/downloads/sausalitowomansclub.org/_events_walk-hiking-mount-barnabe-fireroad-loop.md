# Walk & Hiking: Mount Barnabe Fireroad Loop

June 3, 2025 @ 9:00 am \- 2:00 pm

![Mount Barnabe Fireroad Loop](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screen-Shot-2024-07-14-at-3.15.45-PM.png)

**Mount Barnabe Fireroad Loop**  
9:00am Carpool from SWC  
Discover the stunning, uncrowded beauty of this Bay Area gem near Point Reyes with a moderate 5.6-mile loop hike. Starting amidst the majestic redwoods of Samuel P. Taylor Park, our route gradually ascends 1400 feet to the summit of Barnabe Peak. From this vantage point, you’ll be treated to unforgettable panoramic views in every direction. Remarkably, this summit is home to one of only two working lookout stations remaining in Marin County. After completing our hike, we’ll gather for a delicious lunch at Giaco’s in San Geronimo. Remember to bring a hat and sunscreen, with hiking sticks being optional for added support.

RSVP by May 29th to co-leaders Sandy Strawbridge or Nancy Curran
