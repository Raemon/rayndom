# Walk & Hike: Corte Madera Marshland Walk – CANCELLED

April 28, 2025 @ 9:00 am \- 2:00 pm

![Corte Madera Marshland Walk](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screen-Shot-2024-07-14-at-3.09.32-PM.png)

**THIS WALK HAS BEEN CANCELLED!**

**Corte Madera Marshland Walk**  
9:00am Carpool from SWC  
Join us for an easy 3.3-mile loop around the newly restored Corte Madera Marshland Ecological Reserve. This tidal marsh provides critical habitat for endangered species, including the California Ridgway’s rail and the salt marsh harvest mouse. The walk is relatively flat and accessible, offering opportunities to spot wildlife and birds along the way. We’ll conclude with lunch at Amy’s.

RSVP by April 25th to co-leaders Jennifer Gridley or Karen Wilcox
