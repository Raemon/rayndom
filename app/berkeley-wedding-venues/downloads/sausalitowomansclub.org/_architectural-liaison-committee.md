**Summer Recap from the SWC AL Committee  
**This summer the SWC AL Committee has been hard at work completing projects that improve the safety, accessibility, and beauty of our historic clubhouse grounds.

**Pathway Safety & Lighting Project**  
The major project of the season has been the Pathway Safety and Lighting Project, funded entirely by the Sausalito Woman’s Club Preservation Society. The focus of this work has been to create a safe, even, and well-lit pathway for members and visitors, while removing long-standing tripping hazards.

Loose gravel, uneven flagstone, and deteriorated concrete have been replaced with durable, sand-finished concrete walkways designed with proper drainage. These improvements provide a stable, uniform surface that enhances accessibility and safety for all who visit, including those with mobility challenges.

Lighting has been a key feature of this project, with 24 low-voltage lights planned for installation along the entire pathway. Ten were placed earlier this month, immediately transforming the evening atmosphere and making the pathway safer for night use. Due to a temporary shortage of fixtures, installation was delayed, but the remaining lights have now been secured and will be installed by Friday, August 22. At that time, the project will be complete.

**Stage Deck Repairs**  
In addition to the planned pathway work, unexpected deterioration beneath the stage deck was discovered. Out of necessity, this area was repaired promptly to ensure the structure’s integrity and safety. As part of the emergency repair, a new screened irrigation panel was also installed, creating a clean and discreet solution to conceal utilities while maintaining the garden’s beauty.

**Care for the Grounds**  
Great care was taken during construction to protect the surrounding plants and lawn. Only a small portion of the lawn will need reseeding, ensuring the garden will look beautiful for our September wedding rental. The AL Committee and Grounds have worked closely together this summer to replenish the garden with new plantings and to install beautiful stones beneath the deck. These stones not only add to the garden’s appeal but also reduce fire hazards near our beloved historic building.

**Additional Updates**  
Other improvements included repainting and sealing foundation gaps near the Dressing Room windows, upgrading drainage lines, and cleaning exterior walls exposed after hedge and bamboo removal. These smaller projects contribute to a safer, better-maintained property overall.

**Looking Ahead**  
With the Pathway Safety and Lighting Project nearing completion and the stage deck secured, the Club grounds are brighter, safer, and more welcoming than ever. We are grateful to the SWC Preservation Society for funding this critical work and to the Grounds Committee for their partnership in keeping our gardens vibrant and our historic building protected. We also look forward to participating in the upcoming SWCPS fundraiser, Preserving the Magic, in October, which will help replenish the costs spent on preserving our beautiful clubhouse.
