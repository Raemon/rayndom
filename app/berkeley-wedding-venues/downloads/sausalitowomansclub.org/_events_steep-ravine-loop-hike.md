# STEEP RAVINE LOOP HIKE

April 6 @ 9:00 am \- 2:00 pm

Monday, April 6, 2026 | 9:00am – Meet at SWC to carpool 

This 7.5-mile loop combines ocean vistas and redwood ravines in one of Marin’s most iconic hikes. We’ll start at Pantoll and descend the Matt Davis Trail toward Stinson Beach, a mostly downhill 4.5 mile stretch with open coastal views. After lunch at Parkside Café, we’ll hike back up via the lush and shady Steep Ravine Trail, ascending through fern-filled canyons and alongside wooden ladders and waterfalls. This is a strenuous but rewarding hike – ideal for strong walkers. Bring water, a hat, hiking shoes, and money for lunch. Poles encouraged. RSVP by 4/3 to Co-leaders Susan Watson and Dana Whitson.
