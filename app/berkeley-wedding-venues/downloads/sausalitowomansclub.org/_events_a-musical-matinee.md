# A MUSICAL MATINEE

March 30, 2025 @ 3:00 pm \- 5:00 pm

![](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Logo25June20.png)

Jim Stopher, classical pianist, composer and conductor, returns to SWC on Sunday, March 30, 3 PM. He brought down the house last year with his incredibly moving solo performance. This year’s program promises to be equally stunning with pieces by Haydn, J. S. Bach, Brahms, and Rachmaninoff on SWC’s beautiful grand piano.

His vibrant career as a conductor, pianist, composer, and educator, includes heading the Music Department at College of Marin where he leads the College of Marin Symphony Orchestra and teaches music theory, repertoire, history and ear training. He has soloed with several city orchestras including the Mill Valley Philharmonic and is Music Director of others.

Mr. Stopher graduated from the renowned Peabody Conservatory of Music, where he studied with conductors Gustav Meier, Markand Thakar, and Marin Alsop. He is enthusiastic about bringing music to residents of Marin County, both through his work at the college and with programs in the community.

Light refreshments will be served at Intermission and there will be a cash wine bar. Charge is $25. Event Co-chairs are Paula Monsef and Susie Visher. RSVP online https://sausalitowomansclub.org/events/a-musical-matinee/

A few volunteers are needed. Please contact Paula Monsef if you would like to be one of them!
