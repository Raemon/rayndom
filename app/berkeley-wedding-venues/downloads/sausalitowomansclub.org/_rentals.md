# RENTALS

by [saus94965](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/author/saus94965/ "Posts by saus94965") | Aug 31, 2025 | [Committee Reports](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/category/committee-reports/), [Newsletter](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/category/newsletter/)

The Sausalito Woman’s Club has long stood as a beacon of community, creativity, and camaraderie. Our historic clubhouse is more than just a gathering place—it is the heart of countless celebrations, thoughtful meetings, and meaningful moments that have shaped our organization and the wider Sausalito community for over a century. As stewards of this beloved historical landmark, we strive to uphold our mission of fostering social, educational, and philanthropic activities, while welcoming new faces to experience the charm and warmth of our space.  
As we move forward into another season, we are pleased to share an update on rentals, highlighting recent successes, outlining upcoming opportunities, and revisiting our policies.

**Rental Program Overview**  
Our clubhouse continues to attract those seeking a unique and memorable setting for their event. From weddings and milestone celebrations to intimate gatherings and professional retreats, we offer an elegant and versatile venue imbued with history and heart.  
Our rental calendar reflects a vibrant mix of weddings, nonprofit and private bookings. Each event—whether an afternoon garden wedding, an evening gala, or a corporate seminar—contributes to the maintenance and preservation of our historic property**.**

Highlights & Recent Successes  
The past year we have seen a steady interest in our venue.  
A few highlights from the past twelve months:  
• Hosted four weddings.  
• Welcomed two local nonprofit organizations for community-based events at reduced cost, in keeping with our mission of service.  
• Accommodated a national television program to film in a quiet, private location.  
Current Policies & Procedures  
Over the past few years, our Board of Directors and Rentals Committee have worked diligently to ensure our policies reflect both the heritage of our Club and the needs of modern event hosts. When someone rents our clubhouse, they can expect a process that is transparent, welcoming, and supportive at every step.  
Key aspects of our rental program include:  
• Availability: The clubhouse is available for private rentals on select weekends and weekdays, with priority given to Club members.  
• Spaces: We offer several distinct spaces, including our iconic Main Hall, sunlit sitting area with dramatic views of the San Francisco skyline, and a cozy Fireplace room, each suited for events of various sizes and formats.  
• Capacity: Depending on configuration, we can accommodate gatherings up to 100 guests while maintaining comfort and safety.  
• Accessibility: Our recent upgrades ensure all guests can access and enjoy the clubhouse, including those with mobility challenges.  
• Vendor Flexibility: Renters are welcome to select their preferred caterers, florists, and entertainers, subject to our rental agreement rules.  
• Sustainability: We encourage eco-conscious practices, including composting, recycling, and minimizing single-use items for all events.  
• Support: Our Rentals Committee and dedicated event hosts are available throughout the planning process to help coordinate logistics, answer questions, and ensure every detail is attended to.

**Booking Process**  
We strive to make booking our venue as straightforward and accommodating as possible:  
• Prospective renters begin by submitting an online inquiry form or contacting our Rentals Committee directly.  
• An initial consultation—either onsite or virtual—allows us to discuss the event vision, review availability, and tour the spaces best suited to the renter’s needs.  
• Once a date is tentatively reserved, we provide a comprehensive rental agreement outlining policies, fees, and timelines.  
• A deposit secures a booking, with the balance due prior to the event date. Our cancellation and refund policies are designed to offer flexibility should plans need to change.  
• On the day of the event, members of the Rental team will be present to provide assistance and ensure everything runs smoothly.

**Looking Ahead: 2026 and Beyond**  
As we look toward the future, we remain committed to making the SWC a welcoming space for both members and the public. We are actively exploring new ways to enhance the rental experience, including:  
• Investing in further upgrades to our kitchen and technology infrastructure to better accommodate a range of event styles and requirements.  
• Developing new partnerships with local vendors and service providers to offer renters a variety of choices.  
• Expanding our outreach to corporate and nonprofits in the local area, ensuring our clubhouse continues to serve as a hub for community engagement.

The SWC is a treasure not only for its members but for the entire Sausalito community. Our rental program helps sustain the Club’s mission, fund important initiatives, and open the doors of our iconic clubhouse to those who wish to celebrate life’s special moments in a truly unforgettable setting.
