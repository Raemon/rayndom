**The 2024-25 Year-End report[CLICK HERE](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2024-25-year-end-donations-report.pdf)**

The Donations Committee focuses the Club’s donations in our three traditional areas of giving: local, families/women and children and the environment.

**Memorial Donations**  
SWC honors the lives of our members with a memorial donation to Save the Redwoods League a San Francisco based, nonprofit established in 1918, inspired by the California Federation of Women’s Clubs who are committed to restoring and protecting California’s redwood forests and connecting people to the peace and beauty of redwood forests.

_Giving is not just about making a donation._  
_It is about making a difference._

Donation Committee Co-Chairs: Susan Daniloff & Julie Carlson
