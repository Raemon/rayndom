# HISTORY OCT 2025

**Did You Know?**

The SWC has a History Committee, described in our by-laws in Article XII, Section 10:“The History Committee shall be responsible for ensuring that historical materials are collected and are suitably archived and stored.”

To fulfill this responsibility, we have collected documents and photos over the years and stored them in binders in the library cabinet in the Board Room. This has created a wonderful collection of historical materials.

A few years ago, we created a Gmail account and began storing documents and photos in our Google Drive. Recognizing that we are now in the digital age, this year we are embarking on a project to scan the documents and photos from our archival binders and add them to Google Drive. We will keep the binders, but searching online will make research and information retrieval much easier.

Going forward, we ask program chairs to submit digital copies of their program announcements, programs, and other materials to us for storage on our Google Drive, rather than submitting hard copies. Please send them to Sharon Seymour, Chair of the History Committee, at [sharon126@aol.com](mailto:sharon126@aol.com)
