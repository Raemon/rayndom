# Amenities

by [saus94965](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/author/saus94965/ "Posts by saus94965") | Aug 26, 2025 | [Committee Reports](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/category/committee-reports/), [Newsletter](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/category/newsletter/)

Since the publication of the last Monthly Newsletter in June, before summer 2025 unfolded, a lot of important information has come to the attention of the Amenities Committee. Some of this information may be known already to members, by weekly announcements.

  * We learned that Jean Spaulding was scheduled for shoulder replacement surgery in mid-May.
  * Cynnie Anderson’s eldest sister, Lainey, died in late May.
  * Arliss Willis had an emergency appendectomy in early May.
  * Sandy Strawbridge had surgery in early May.
  * Hospitalizations of members included those of Jan Wahl, Rosalie Wallace and Karen Soloman (who had hip surgery).
  * New Member, Blair Odom, broke her leg in early July.
  * Dedicated member of Outreach, MaryKae Krause, has recently has a serious fall and would enjoy a card of good wishes mailed to her Nevada Street address, but not, for now at least, any visitors.
  * MaryJo Westwater, a former member, died mid-May.
  * Barbara Kavanagh, also a former member, died earlier this summer.



We would enjoy having an email or otherwise written message from you sharing your good news and celebrations, especially if we may share your joys and celebrations generally among our SWC sisters. If you are experiencing an illness or are facing a health facility stay, or just need a cheerful greeting or special touch of kindness, please contact Denise or Diane in writing so we may note and respond to your concerns and, with your permission, share your concerns and needs with the membership generally. If appropriate for us to send a card to a member and she is staying elsewhere than at her “yearbook address,” please be sure to give us current information of the address to which we may write.
