## **FOUNDERS’ DAY LUNCHEON – Thursday**

Founders’ Week is right around the corner! Everyone is eagerly anticipating seeing our cast of new members and classics perform another wonderful show for our members. This years show was written by Karen Betzner and is being directed by Candace Curtis On Thursday, March 19th.

As everyone is aware, Founders’ Day Luncheon is sold out. We currently have a wait list of 18 people for Founders’ Day. If you are unable to attend, please be kind enough to let Yvonne know so that a seat can open up for someone else on the list.

Second Vice-President Fay Rudio has been working tirelessly to create a wonderful afternoon honoring our President Susan Daniloff. If you are interested in helping please contact her at [fayrudio@comcast.net](mailto:fayrudio@comcast.net). Chefs Lucy Alderman and Jenny Tomerlin are preparing a one of a kind meal, which will include shellfish. If you have a dietary restriction please let Jenifer Tomerlin [jenifertomerlin@gmail.com](mailto:jenifertomerlin@gmail.com) know as soon as possible.

Parking of course is always at a premium on these special days at the Club. At the February Compulsory Meeting we took a count of people who use the shuttle, only a few hands were raised so we are not organizing an ongoing shuttle since most make other arrangements. We ask that you consider walking, get dropped off, carpooling or using a ride-sharing service (taxi, lyft or uber, CARRS) instead. If you will need assistance please contact Kim Huff [kim@kimber.net](mailto:kim@kimber.net)

## **LOW JINKS – Saturday**

If you are on the wait list we encourage you to make a reservation for the Low Jinks on Saturday, March 21. Please rsvp to Yvonne Spencer. Chair Heather Jones is preparing a wonderful evening with hearty appetizers and desserts and a celebratory No-Host bar. If you have questions about the event, or would like to volunteer, please contact Heather jones [jonzy1@me.com ](mailto:jonzy1@me.com)Overflow parking will be available at Christ Church/Campbell Hall.

## **DRESS REHEARSAL – Tuesday**

If you’re unable to attend either Low Jinks of Founders’ Day Luncheon, consider attending the Dress Rehearsal on Tuesday, March 17th. Of course we ask that you keep your lips sealed about the show until after Founders’ Day to keep it a surprise for our President, Susan Daniloff. Chair Mimi Reich is planning light snacks and a No-Host Bar. Dinner for Cast & Crew (only) will follow the conclusion. If you would like to help, we can use it! Please contact Mimi Reich [creich07@comcast.net](mailto:creich07@comcast.net) or 415-887-9433. Overflow parking will be available at Star of the Sea Church.

### **Please rsvp to Yvonne Spencer[yvonners13@gmail.com](mailto:yvonners13@gmail.com) or 415-332-0214.**

### **Please consider our neighbors and Walk, Carpool or use a Ride-Share Service to the club events.**
