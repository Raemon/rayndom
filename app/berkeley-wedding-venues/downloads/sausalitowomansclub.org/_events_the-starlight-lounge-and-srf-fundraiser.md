# The Starlight Lounge an SRF Fundraiser

April 5, 2025 @ 6:00 pm \- 9:00 pm

![](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image002.png)

Our spring fundraiser, “The Starlight Lounge” is right around the corner! Please mark your calendars for a fun-filled evening on April 5th at 6pm. We’ll start at twilight with an open bar featuring our signature cocktail, wine, bubbles, and other libations. Hors d’oeuvres will be passed as you make your way around the Starlight Lounge visiting new and old friends. Bring your dancing shoes, because later in the evening the music will get your toes tapping. Heavier bites will be served until 9pm.
