#### "OH, MARY!"

#### ** September 10 @ 7:00 pm – 9:00 pm**

Join us for opening night of Sausalito Players  
  


The Sausalito Players kick off the season on Wednesday, September 10 with a staged reading of “Oh, Mary!”, directed by Van Dyke Roth, at the Sausalito Woman’s Club (120 Central Ave.). Doors open at 6:30 pm; show begins at 7:00pm.

About the Show:

Oh, Mary! hilariously reimagines Mary Todd Lincoln as a boozy, cabaret-obsessed First Lady teetering on the edge of disaster. Part drag, part chaos, all comedy—this wildly entertaining reading promises big laughs and zero history lessons. Don’t miss the madness with cult-favorite energy waiting to be seen! Mature themes. 2025 Tony Winner and Pulitzer Prize Finalist.

Founded in 1977 by Ann and Peter Arnott, The Sausalito Players present four shows a year plus a Holiday Variety Show—always free and open to the public (donations welcome). Each August, the next season’s readings are chosen at our annual spaghetti dinner.

Parking is limited, please walk, carpool or ride share to our residential neighborhood.
