# BALTIMORE CANYON, DAWN FALLS, KING MOUNTAIN LOOP HIKE

February 10 @ 9:00 am \- 2:00 pm

Tuesday, February 10, 2026 | 9:00am – Meet at SWC to carpool 

One of Marin’s lesser-known but most picturesque and serene hikes, this nearly 7 mile loop in nearby Larkspur offers a rich variety of terrain and scenery. We’ll begin in the historic redwoods of Baltimore Canyon and wind through lush groves of ferns to reach Dawn Falls – our group photo op spot. From there, we’ll climb up to Crown Road and cross into the King Mountain Open Space Preserve before descending back to the canyon floor via the charming and shaded Ladybug Trail. This is a moderately challenging hike. Trekking poles are recommended. Lunch to follow at Farm House Local. 

RSVP by 2/7 to Co-leaders Kathy Atkins-Page and Lynnie Spiller.
