# FOUR HILLS OF SF HIKE

January 15 @ 9:30 am \- 2:00 pm

Thursday, January 15, 2026 | 9:30am – Meet at SWC to carpool 

Explore the hidden gems of San Francisco’s Cole Valley and Haight-Ashbury districts. We’ll hike Mount Sutro, Tank Hill, Mount Olympus, and Buena Vista Park – all wonderfully unique spots off the beaten path. Three moderate climbs and a long staircase with an option to go at a slower pace. It can become a strenuous hike with fast paced walking/climbing. Both options are available. Lunch to follow at a French bistro in Cole Valley. 

RSVP by 1/12 to Co-leaders Helen Bennett and Nancy Curran.
