# ANGEL ISLAND HIKE

March 30 @ 10:00 am \- 2:00 pm

Monday, March 30, 2026 | 10:00am – Depart via Tiburon Ferry 10:00am / Return via Tiburon Ferry 3:20om. 

Step back in time and take in breathtaking views on this memorable day trip to Angel Island State Park. We’ll catch the 10:00am ferry from Tiburon and explore the island on foot, enjoying 360° panoramic views of San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge, Mt. Tam, and beyond. This hike offers two options: a moderate loop around the island or a shorter walk combined with a shuttle ride to the island’s historic immigration station. There, we’ll visit several small museums that chronicle the fascinating history of Angel Island from 1910–1940. Bring your lunch, water, layers, and a hat. Trekking poles are optional.  
RSVP by 3/28 to Co-leaders Margo Merle and Nancy Curran.
