**Slide Ranch Hike from Muir Beach**  
9:00am Carpool from SWC  
Join us for a scenic 4.5-5 mile hike starting at Muir Beach. We’ll traverse the Redwood Creek Trail, cross Santos Meadow, and follow the Heather Cutoff Trail down to Slide Ranch, a non-profit educational farm. On the return trip, we’ll take the Owl Trail, which offers stunning vistas of the ocean and the Marin Headlands. After the hike, we’ll enjoy a picnic lunch together.

RSVP by September 24th to Co-Leaders Karen Wilcox or Jennifer Gridley
