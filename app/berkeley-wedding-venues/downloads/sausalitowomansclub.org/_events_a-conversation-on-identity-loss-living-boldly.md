# A CONVERSATION ON IDENTITY, LOSS, & LIVING BOLDLY

October 9, 2025 @ 4:00 pm \- 6:30 pm

![](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/b154c440-50f7-53e6-40a1-9c868ff1567a.png)

Thursday, October 9, 4:00 – 6:30 pm

Join us for an inspiring evening at the Sausalito Woma n’s Club led by member Ingrid Hu Dahl, as she traces the intersections of being queer, mixed–race, and navigating profound loss. In conversation with a panel of local female creatives, Ingrid will guide a dialogue on claiming identity, making meaning from grief, and choosing to live boldly. Together, we’ll explore what it means to lead with authenticity and connect across differences in our community and beyond.

Limit 100. $10. [PURCHASE HERE](https://square.link/u/2qCgpgPo)  
Questions to Ingrid Hu Dahl.
