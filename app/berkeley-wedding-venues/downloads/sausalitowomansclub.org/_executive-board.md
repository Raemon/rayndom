# **THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE**

Dear Exquisite Members,

It is with great joy & anticipation that I welcome you to a new season of connection, celebration, and community within our beloved Sausalito Woman’s Club. I am so privileged & honored to be following in the footsteps of such legendary women & leaders, that have volunteered hours of their time, talents, & energy, to improve & maintain this unique organization for over the 100 years! As President, I am honored to lead alongside an inspiring team and to carry forward our shared mission with intention and heart.

With great appreciation and renewed energy, the 2025– 2026 Executive Board and I thank you for the privilege of leading this extraordinary Club into a vibrant new year. We are thrilled to welcome five new board members that have each been in the Club for less than 5 years, bringing fresh perspectives; joining 9 other Classic members, who will instill the importance of The Club’s INSTITIONAL TRADITIONS. This blend of new and seasoned voices introduces a dynamic momentum that will inspire and energize us all.

Our mission is to infuse our gatherings and communications with fun, enthusiasm, and heartfelt positivity, continuing the legacy of connection that makes SWC so special.

**MEMBERSHIP GROWTH** is a top priority, guided by Four Core Pillars:

  * **Energetic Enthusiasm** – fuels our creativity and encourages us to bring our best selves forward.
  * **Engaged Positivity** – reminds us of the joy that comes from lifting one another up and celebrating each other’s successes.
  * **Empowerment** – calls us to support and inspire each member to grow, lead, and thrive—both within the club and beyond.
  * **Elegant Simplicity** – guides us to find sustainable beauty in clarity, purpose, and authentic connection.



These values will shape a warm, inclusive, and empowering environment—one we can all take pride in. Together, we will welcome and mentor new members, fostering the next generation of leadership.

It is the bond we share as members, that sustains our community—keeping The Sausalito Woman’s Club – vibrant, relevant, and alive.

With gratitude and excitement,  
Reneé Lee
