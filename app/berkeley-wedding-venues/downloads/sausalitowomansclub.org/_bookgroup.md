_**Fox & I: An Uncommon Friendship by Catherine Raven**_ is a beautifully written, wise, and intimate memoir, by a biologist about what she learned from a wild fox.

### **Quick Tips for Non-Readers**

No time to read the book but want to join us? Here are some quick ways to prepare prior to the discussion:

**Start with a Summary:** Wikipedia summaries offer a quick overview of the book’s storyline, characters, and themes. You’ll also find helpful links to learn more about the author and related topics.

**Explore Thoughtful Reviews:** Search “[book title] + book review” to find critiques from respected sources. Reviews help you understand the book’s strengths, weaknesses, and context—and may  
introduce you to related works.

**Hear Directly from the Author:** Authors often appear on podcasts and interviews to discuss their books. Listening can give you insight into their motivations, background, and behind-the-scenes stories.

**Follow the Author Online:** Check the author’s social platforms for interviews, book updates, and personal perspectives. These pages often link to additional resources worth exploring.

**During the Session, Listen First:** Let those who read the book guide the discussion and share their  
takeaways first. This gives you richer context and helps you respond thoughtfully.
