# Sausalito Players

April 16, 2025 @ 7:30 pm \- 9:00 pm

![](https://sausalitowomansclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/logo.jpg)

The Sausalito Players presents the play, 2 Across, written by Jerry Mayer. Two strangers, a psychologist and an unemployed ad man find themselves alone on a San Francisco commuter train at 4 a.m., each doing their New York Times crossword puzzles. Before their crosswords are solved, they find that they may have solved the puzzles of their own lives. Directed by Carol Sheldon and starring Julie Nagorski and Dr. Michael MacDonald. Wednesday, April 16, 2025, at 7:30 PM at the Sausalito Woman’s Club, 120 Central Ave. Sausalito, CA. Free admission and light refreshments.
