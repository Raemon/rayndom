# MT TAM – WEST POINT INN HIKE

May 18 @ 8:30 am \- 2:00 pm

Monday, May 18, 2026 | 8:45am – Meet at SWC to carpool

Experience the best of Mt. Tamalpais on this scenic 5-mile loop. Starting at Rock Springs, we’ll descend to Boot Jack and make our way across the Matt Davis Trail, taking in the coastal views and traveling on some rugged terrain, crossing wooden bridges, and traversing over creeks. Our climb brings us to the historic West Point Inn—an old stagecoach stop nestled in the hills—followed by lunch at the Mountain Theatre, a beautiful stone amphitheater with panoramic vistas. Bring layers for changing weather, hiking poles for uneven terrain, and your own picnic lunch.

RSVP by 5/15 to Co-leaders Karen Wilcox and Jennifer Gridley.
