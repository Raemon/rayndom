**Coastal Loop on Mt. Tam**  
9:00am Carpool from SWC  
Join us for a moderately challenging yet wonderfully scenic 6-mile hike starting at Pantoll. Our route will follow the Matt Davis Trail to Bolinas Ridge Trail, then onto Cataract Trail, and finally the Old Mine Trail, looping back to Pantoll. We’ll stop at Laurel Dell for a picnic lunch. Boots and hiking poles are recommended. Please bring your own lunch for picnicking!

RSVP by March 21st to co-leaders Susan Watson or Dana Whitson
