# Amenities & Activities

## Golf Course

Berkeley Country Club is home to a championship 18-hole golf course originally designed by renowned architects Robert Hunter and Willie Watson. In 2012, a major restoration by Forrest Richardson & Associates returned all 18 greens and 44 bunkers to their classic Golden Age design—reviving the strategic brilliance and natural beauty that define our course. With sweeping views of the Bay Area and a layout that challenges and rewards, this is golf as it was meant to be played.

## Clubhouse

Our English Tudor-style Clubhouse, designed by prominent Bay Area architect Walter Ratcliff Jr., has been a landmark since 1921. Thoughtful renovations have modernized its offerings while preserving the character and craftsmanship of the original design. It stands today as the heart of the Club—a welcoming space for members to gather, dine, and celebrate.

## Dining

The Hunter Grill delivers casual elegance with panoramic views and exceptional cuisine. Named in honor of Robert Hunter—Berkeley Country Club member, Green Committee visionary, and course co-designer—this space is where tradition meets taste. The adjacent Lakeside Dining Room provides a relaxed setting to relive your round, catch the game, and connect over a well-earned drink.

## Fitness Center

Located on the second floor of the Clubhouse, our 1,000-square-foot fitness center is equipped with modern cardio, strength training, and flexibility equipment. Whether you're preparing for your next round or prioritizing wellness, our facility supports a healthy, active lifestyle.

## Locker Rooms

Our fully appointed Men's and Women's Locker Rooms offer comfort, convenience, and full-service amenities—including a dedicated shoe attendant for shoe shine and spike services. It's the perfect place to reset and refresh before or after your time on the course.

## Social Events

Berkeley Country Club hosts a vibrant calendar of social events year-round. From holiday celebrations and wine dinners to themed member gatherings, our events are designed to foster connection and community, all while celebrating our shared love of golf, great food, and unforgettable experiences.

## Private Events & Meeting Spaces

Our Clubhouse offers a range of event venues—including the Bay Ballroom, Vista Room, Vista Deck, and Boardroom—all with sweeping vistas from the Bay Bridge to the Golden Gate and beyond. Whether you're planning a wedding, private dinner, or corporate meeting, these spaces deliver a one-of-a-kind setting for your most important moments.
