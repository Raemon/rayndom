# Guest Information

We are pleased to welcome you to Berkeley Country Club. To maximize your enjoyment of our facilities review these rules and policies and applicable dress code standards before your visit.

### Golf

All golfers must check in to the golf shop before beginning play. All play will begin on the 1st tee unless otherwise directed by the golf professional staff.

### Dress Code

Members are responsible for informing their guests of our dress code and ensuring their attire conforms to our written rules and policies found on the member website and updated from time to time.

#### Appropriate Attire for the Driving Range & Golf Course

##### Gentlemen

Collared shirts with mid-thigh shorts (or trousers) and golf shoes with non metal spikes. If we sell an apparel item in the golf shop and it is intended to be worn while playing the game of golf it is deemed appropriate attire for wear on the golf course. Denim, cotton sweats, tank tops, and clothing with logos in poor taste are not acceptable. Billed caps and hats are to be worn in the intended manner (not backwards). Collarless mock necks golf specific shirts are allowed.

##### Women

Blouses (with or without sleeves) or collared shirts with slacks, mid-thigh length shorts, skirts, or culottes and golf shoes. If we sell an apparel item in the golf shop and it is intended to be worn while playing the game of golf it is deemed appropriate attire for wear on the golf course. Denim, cotton sweats, tank tops, and clothing with logos in poor taste are not acceptable. Billed caps and hats are to be worn in the intended manner (not backwards). Non-metal spikes are required for golf shoes. 

#### Appropriate Attire for the Hunter Grill

Appropriate attire for the Hunter Grill includes golf attire, jeans without rips/holes, t-shirts without obscene or offensive appliques, and all women's attire that is not deemed too suggestive - i.e. low cut top/blouse, spaghetti straps with deep cuts revealing too much skin or shorts that could not be worn as appropriate attire for use on the golf course. Men should remove headwear in the grill. Members are responsible for their guests and compliance with dress code standards. As a general rule attire should match the decorum of the country club setting and not detract from other members' experience of the club and the grill. If you have questions about the dress code please inquire with the General Manager.

### Cell Phone Policy

Mobile devices are to be placed on silent while on club property and a general rule for social courtesy exists throughout club property which is, no member or guest should have their club experience negatively impacted by the use of a call phone from another.

### Locker Rooms

Our locker room attendant would be glad to assist you in selecting a day use locker for your guests usage. Additionally, our attendant can provide shoe or spike services upon request.

### Restaurant

Please check in at the host station to be seated.

### Snack Bar

Charges at the snack bar can be paid for by member charge, reciprocal member account or by credit card payment.

### On Course Restrooms

We have one restroom on course at hole #5 adjacent to the green on the right hand side. Additionally there are more modern restroom facilities inside the Turn Cafe at the 9th green, and behind the 15th green in the corporation yard facility.

### Tipping

Berkeley Country Club does allow tipping for our members and guests but it’s optional and your way of acknowledging service that goes above and beyond. We do charge a 18% service charge for all F&B purchases.

### Cash

The Club is a cash free facility and you should not expect to be able to pay for any transaction by cash at any time.

### Banquet Event

Our service charge for banquet events is 24%. El Cerrito noise ordinance requires that indoor live music is discontinued by midnight and outdoor live music discontinues by 10 pm.

### Directions

The Club is located at 7901 Cutting Boulevard and older map software may list the Club as Mira Vista Golf & Country Club as we rebranded in 2017 back to Berkeley Country Club.

### Hours of Operation

The club is open Tuesday - Sunday from 7 am - 6:00 pm with seasonal hours in the golf shop and restaurant. The club is closed on Monday unless we open for a National Holiday that falls on a Monday and in that case the club will be closed on Tuesday following a Monday holiday opening.
