# Club History

The origins of Berkeley Country Club reflect the same spirit that imbues the Club today: a group of friends and golf aficionados seeking a great place to play, relax and enjoy a good meal in an incomparable setting.

Founded in 1920 by prominent professors and alumni of UC Berkeley and other civic and business leaders, the Club purchased a site high in the Berkeley Hills with 360 degree views of the surrounding Bay Area. Noted architect Walter Ratcliff Jr, was hired to design the Club’s magnificent English Tudor style clubhouse (1920) and ballroom addition (1924). For the golf course, the Club turned to founding member, Robert Hunter (co-designer of Cypress Point) and William “Willie” Watson (Olympic Club architect). The result was a true classic “Golden Age” course, superbly routed over the existing natural terrain and incorporating breathtaking vistas of San Francisco, the Golden Gate, Mt. Tamalpais and Wildcat Canyon.

Steeped in tradition, the Club was the site of the 1929 Berkeley Open won by Horton Smith (Masters Champion 1934 and 1936) as well as an exhibition match featuring a pair of then reigning champions, Johnny Farrell (US Open) and Walter Hagen (British Open). A comprehensive course restoration, in keeping with the original Hunter and Watson design, was completed in 2011 by Forrest Richardson & Associates. The project received national recognition including the inaugural “Award for Excellence” from the prestigious The American Society of Golf Course Architects (ASGCA).

Challenging, yet playable, for all skill levels, with social and dining amenities for the entire family, Berkeley Country Club is truly a special place. This year marks our 100th anniversary.
