With expert coaching and a tailored approach, members can take their performance to the next level in a convenient and familiar setting. 

**Meet Your Coach – Alex Greiner**

Hi, I'm Alex Greiner, Golf Performance Coach at Perform for Golf. I hold a Master's in Applied Physiology & Kinesiology (Strength & Conditioning emphasis) from the University of Florida. I am currently intern at Saint Mary's College as a strength and conditioning coach across multiple sports teams. Though I recently returned from ten years in Japan, I grew up just five minutes away in Richmond. I'm passionate about helping athletes improve performance while staying injury-free—and I'm excited to work with the BCC community! 

1 on 1 Coaching \- Have specific fitness or golf goals in mind? Schedule a personalized training session with Coach Alex! Enhance strength, improve speed, and optimize your performance on and off the course. Receive the specialized golf training you deserve. Be the best golfer in your dream tee time pairing and elevate your game — schedule your session today. 

TPI Assessment \- A TPI Assessment takes a close look at how your body moves and how that movement affects your golf swing. It helps identify any physical limitations that might be impacting your performance or increasing your risk of injury. With those insights, you get a customized plan to improve your mobility, strength, and overall movement—so you can swing more efficiently and play your best golf.
