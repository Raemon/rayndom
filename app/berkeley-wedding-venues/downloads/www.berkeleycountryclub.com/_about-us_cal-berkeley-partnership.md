# Cal Berkeley Partnership

## A Storied Partnership: Berkeley Country Club and the University of California, Berkeley

Berkeley Country Club (BCC) has a long and rich history deeply intertwined with the University of California, Berkeley. Originally founded in 1920 with the vision of creating a private club for Cal faculty, alumni, and the broader university community, BCC quickly became a central hub for both athletic and social activities tied to the university. For its first 60 years, BCC was home to the Cal golf teams, offering a premier location for practice and competition. Many notable Cal golfers honed their skills on its championship-level course, further strengthening the club's relationship with the university.

At the heart of this connection was Robert Hunter, a renowned golf course architect and Cal professor. As the principal designer of BCC’s course and Chair of the Green Committee, Hunter played a pivotal role in shaping both the physical landscape of the club and its strong ties to the university. His vision extended beyond golf; he saw BCC as a place where the natural beauty of the East Bay could be preserved and where Cal Athletics could flourish.

Over the years, BCC has hosted prestigious events that attracted Cal alumni, faculty, and students, making the club a vital part of the university’s extended community. Many influential Cal graduates have been prominent members, further intertwining the legacies of both institutions. In recognition of its history and heritage, the club reverted to its original name, Berkeley Country Club, in 2018, reaffirming its commitment to the region and the university.

In 2023, BCC and Cal Athletics formalized this long-standing relationship with a strategic partnership, fulfilling the vision of the club's founding members. As an official Cal Golf Partner and the Home of Cal Athletics, BCC continues to host the men’s and women’s golf teams in an unofficial capacity, providing them access to a world-class course as they prepare for competition. Members can also celebrate this historic partnership by picking up exclusive co-branded BCC and Cal Berkeley merchandise.
