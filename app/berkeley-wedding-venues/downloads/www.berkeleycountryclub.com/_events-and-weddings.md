# Weddings & Events

* * *

Whether you are planning a large wedding, a small business gathering, or a medium-sized celebration, Berkeley Country Club has the perfect place to host your event. Located only 20-minutes from downtown San Francisco, Berkeley Country Club makes you feel like you are a world apart from the big city.

Our three banquet rooms boast some of the most magnificent views in the entire Bay Area. From the San Francisco skyline and Golden Gate Bridge to the Marin Headlands and Mount Tamalpais, the views are vast and breathtaking. And once the sun sets over the Bay, our warmly lit banquet rooms create an equally glorious ambiance for all our country club events and weddings in California.

Designed in the 1920's by the notable Bay Area architect W. H. Ratcliff, the clubhouse is a supreme example of the English Tudor Revival. Berkeley Country Club also provides world-class cuisine and is happy to make special arrangements for groups with dietary needs and preferences.

Bay Ballroom  When you walk into the Bay Ballroom, you can't help but feel exhilarated. The extensive wall of windows provides a panoramic view that stretches all the way from the Bay Bridge to the Richmond Bridge, and on a clear day, to Mount Tamalpais. The room itself is equally magnificent with vaulted ceilings, three chandeliers, up-lit beams, and a massive gas fireplace. When it's time to kick back, there's a spacious 900 foot square dance floor. 

Vista Deck  The beautiful Vista Deck offers views unlike any other event space. With a vast panorama that stretches from the Bay Bridge to the South, encompassing the San Francisco skyline and Golden Gate Bridge, then all the way north to the San Rafael Bridge, this venue truly offers a one-of-a-kind experience for that perfect day. 

Vista Room  The Vista Room fully lives up to its name. A crested bay window provides a glorious vista onto the bay, a perfect place for a ceremony. Chapel-style seating can accommodate 144 people. The vaulted ceiling, beautiful wood paneling, and large gas fireplace create a warm, welcoming, elegant ambiance. 

Board Room  The Boardroom can either serve as a dining area for an intimate party or a meeting room with the traditional long table. Either way, your event will be graced by the glorious views of the Bay, the elegance of the Tudor-style architecture, and, if you like, the warmth of the large, gas fireplace.

## Testimonials

> "My fiancé and I began planning our wedding for May of 2020 back in January 2019. We mainly chose the venue for its proximity to our ceremony location and the beautiful Bay view. When we initially booked with BCC they had another event director who was not very hands on. We were a little nervous of the fact that she wouldn't be present during our reception and communication was lacking through our time working with her.  
>   
> Come February 2020 for our food tasting, we found that BCC had made some changes to staff including their Director of Events. This is when we met Michelle Sand, and all our worries about our reception were gone.  
>   
> Michelle was incredibly professional, hands-on, and reassured us of her extensive experience. Her confidence and passion to ensure a great event put us at ease. Shortly after meeting Michelle and finalizing our menu, the shelter-in-place was initiated and our wedding was put on hold.  
>   
> Again, Michelle was so accommodating and let us postpone to August 2020 without any additional fees. As covid took over all our lives, it became apparent we would not be able to have our 150 person indoor banquet room reception. We returned again to Michelle with the idea of a microwedding reception on the Vista Deck.  
>   
> While BCC had never had a reception on the vista deck, Michelle made sure it was seamless. Our event coordinator had backed out due to covid concerns and Michelle willingly took on the role to ensure a smooth reception.  
>   
> We were a little anxious to host a microwedding during covid times, but Michelle and her team at BCC took every single safety measure and precaution to ensure guest and staff safety, alike. We provided masks for all guests, there was plenty of hand sanitizer, social distancing was maintained (including 2 bars to prevent crowding), and Michelle herself did symptom and temperature screening of all guests and vendors.  
>   
> Everything about our wedding was perfect and we could not have done it without Michelle. Despite everything, BCC created a safe, welcoming environment for all our guests. The food was outstanding, especially the steak. The house margaritas were delicious and everyone raved about the professionalism of all venue staff.  
>   
> All in all we are so pleased with how everything turned out. A very special thank you to Michelle, Ryan, and all staff at BCC for making our day so memorable. If you are looking to go the microwedding route we highly recommend BCC."

> "We just hosted our daughter's wedding at BCC. One word: Fabulous  
>   
> As you might already know, it's a beyond-beautiful setting, with a simply stunning view, a wonderful room for dinner and dancing, and another one for cocktails.  
>   
> The food, which we had tasted ahead of time to choose the entrees and appetizers we wanted, was perhaps even better than the tasting. How one cooks a hundred filets, and have them all come out perfectly cooked and tender and delicious, I don't know. But they do!  
>   
> The real "above and beyond" for the day was how well they handled the weather. We had chosen this venue to a large degree because they had a drop-dead-beautiful site for an outdoor ceremony, which was strongly desired by my daughter, and they could also accommodate an indoor wedding in the event of rain. It being March, we knew we had to have a back-up plan. On the day of the wedding, we had several rounds of sprinkles leading up the ceremony time. Each time, they wiped down the chairs, and right up until the ceremony time, we were unsure where it would take place. Fortunately, the clouds blew over, and we had a stunning outdoor ceremony in the wind-protected deck, just as we had hoped."

> "My husband & I were looking for our perfect reception venue for our September 2015 wedding. We looked all over the Bay Area and after a family recommendation we checked out Berkeley Country Club. Our first contact was wonderful from the interaction we had with Ann Groux, Director of Event Sales. She was warm, knowledgeable, and all about actualizing our special day. During out first site visit we were utterly amazed by the jaw dropping view that we saw of the Bay Area. There aren't many venues in the Bay Area where you get a clear, unobstructed view of the glistening bay and 3 bridges: Bay, Golden Gate, and Richmond.  
>   
> We continued to be impressed when we viewed the beautiful rooms inside of Berkeley Country Club. The main room had gorgeous arched ceilings and big windows that allow you to continue to see the breathtaking view of the Bay.  
>   
> Ann Groux was very helpful & accommodating of both us and in working with our Wedding Planner. We felt that her main objective was to make sure we had the wedding of our dreams. Guess what?? She helped it to be the wedding of our dreams!  
>   
> Both ourselves & our guests loved cocktail hour on the deck that sat above the golf course overlooking the amazing view on a perfectly warm , clear, and sunny day. Many selfies were taken with that breathtaking view as the backdrop. Our guest raved about the appetizers, especially the coconut shrimp!! Those flew off the platter!!  
>   
> "We were very happy with the buffet style meal we selected. Our wedding guests were also impressed with the yummy meal! I loved the crusted salmon & the Asian noodle salad. The bartenders & staff were sweet & professional.  
>   
> A major highlight & memory we and our guests continue to talk about is the sunset photo we were able to capture with all of our wedding guests and the Bay Area view behind us.  
>   
> Long story short, Berkeley Country Club was the perfect venue for us and we are so happy that it will forever be apart of our special day."

> "I couldn't be happier that we chose Berkeley Country Club as our venue for our wedding in April. Ann was great (although sometimes a little difficult to get a hold of) and the setting, scenery and view were awesome. Watching the fog roll in was a sight to be seen for our out of town guests (and the pictures in the fog are amazing!)  
>   
> We had the ceremony in the Vista Room, cocktail hour on the deck and the reception in the Ballroom. Every location had an amazing view and guests continue to comment on the food which was delicious! Ann was so accommodating and helpful with every detail from our menu to the vendors and great with suggestions.  
>   
> I was nervous about having a "Country Club" wedding, but the Berkeley Country Club is such warm and inviting venue as my family said, we "scored." :)"
