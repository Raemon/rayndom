## Testimonials

> "Berkeley Country Club is the East Bay's best kept secret. From the challenging golf and breathtaking views to the welcoming member community, BCC is truly one-of-a-kind." 

#####  Dan Hutson 

######  Member Since 2020 

> "Berkeley Country Club represents the best of the Bay Area. Everyone from the management team, club and golf staff, superintendent and maintenance team, members, board and committee chairs all take that extra step to maintain and continually improve upon the culture and community of BCC. A welcoming environment to share with family, friends and neighbors.   
>   
> In only a short few months, my family has thoroughly enjoyed time on the course, at the clubhouse, and we often leverage the partnership with Lakeridge Athletic Club (LAC). I greatly appreciate the number of members that have quickly welcomed our family and how easy it's been to create a golf community for myself. My wife and children have enjoyed a few hot afternoons at the LAC pool, some of the holiday events at the clubhouse, and my oldest son is already benefiting from golf lessons.   
>   
> I couldn't be happier with our initial experience at BCC. It has been a pleasure."

With its undulating course and intricate green complexes, each round promises a unique and engaging challenge, making it an ideal choice for frequent play. The meticulously maintained conditions, complemented by breathtaking bay views, add to the allure of this esteemed club. However, what truly distinguishes Berkeley Country Club is its vibrant sense of community, fostered among its diverse membership. Furthermore, our outstanding pro shop staff, along with our dedicated head pro, curate exciting tournaments, provide top-notch instruction, and continuously enhance our junior program. If you and your family crave a sophisticated yet relaxed atmosphere for your golfing endeavors, Berkeley Country Club is the perfect destination." 

#####  Kyle Itani 

######  Member Since 2018 

> "Berkeley Country Club has grown to become an integral part of my life over the past 2 years. The golf course is a fair and fun test of your game  requiring every shot in the bag to score well. However, the most impactful part of the club, for me, has been the community. We are an eclectic bunch and I have made friends that I consider family because of this club. I couldn't imagine being a member anywhere else." 

#####  Ryan Irish 

######  Member Since 2021 

> "The Berkeley Country Club has been my golf community for 37 years. The richly diverse membership, the incredible vistas from a challenging golf course are what motivated me to join. The current management is the best I've experienced in all those years. From the general manager to the course superintendent the pro shop and the service staff are as good as any that I experienced anywhere." 

#####  Patrick Leaper 

######  Member Since 1983 

> "As a Lady golfing member, the benefits offered to women is limitless. Our female golfers have ability to play 104 private clubs extending from Redding to the Monterey Peninsula through our Open Days and NCGA sponsored tournaments. At our home club we have a unrivaled ability to enjoy both as much social and competitive golf as you desire, with a diverse membership, while enjoying a three bridge view in the El Cerrito hills on an historic course with an amazing club house." 

#####  Jan Bridges 

######  Member Since 2008 

> "My wife Cheryl and I count ourselves fortunate to be members since 2010. Joining BCC enhanced our golfing and social lives in a big way. The facility includes an impressive pedigree, a scenic, intriguing golf course layout with killer views of San Francisco Bay and a graceful Tudor-style clubhouse. But what sets it apart in my mind goes beyond the fairways and greens and the bricks and mortar. It is the truly unique camaraderie among the membership and the friendly professionalism of the staff."
