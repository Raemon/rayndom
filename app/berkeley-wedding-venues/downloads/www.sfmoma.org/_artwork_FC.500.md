_SFX: creaking wood, water slapping gently against a pier or harbor wall, seagulls_

NARRATOR: 

The artist who made this, Mark di Suvero, grew up in San Francisco. He came here by ship during World War II, when he was just a little kid.

SFX: _fade up Mark di Suvero in the background _―  _the narrator will come in over the top. Keep the ax running the whole time so it has an informal quality, like narrator is listening too, and just comes in once in awhile to clarify. _

_SFX: foghorn_

DI SUVERO: 

You have your first impressions and — coming in the Golden Gate — the Golden Gate Bridge is such a gorgeous bridge. I mean, as you can see from my work, I really respond to bridges and that kind of framed structures … a different sense of space. 

NARRATOR: 

When di Suvero was about eight years old, he met a San Francisco character named Ma Lowell.

DI SUVERO: 

She was a carver, a wood carver, and educated a whole group of children in San Francisco. She said to me, “You read too many books. I’m gonna show you how to work with your hands.” And then I became a boat builder. And I learned so much as a boat builder that it was amazing. 

_SFX: woodworking/water sounds_

DI SUVERO: 

All my early work was wood. When you’re working with the art and you accept that there is this flux and reflux from the work, and the suggestions that come from the work guide you, then at that moment, the piece seems to grow by itself. And it’s the real joy of doing art.

NARRATOR:

We are standing at Mark di Suvero’s _Che_ _farò_ _senza Eurydice_ from 1959. This sculpture, made of wood, ropes, nails, and metal bolts, is big — six-feet-eight-inches high, nine-feet wide, and a little more than seven-and-a-half-feet deep. Seventeen thick wooden planks of various lengths are nailed into a spacious, angular, asymmetrical composition. The wood is salvaged timber of an earthy brown color. There is no clear “front” or “back,” and the work can be viewed from anywhere around it. For the purposes of this description, we will stand looking at it, perpendicular to its widest point. The sculpture meets the floor in two places, approximately six feet apart: at the left side, a single plank angles up about forty-five degrees. It supports a smaller piece of wood with a rectangular hole cut from it at its highest upward end. The upward pointing plank is crossed at its midpoint by a horizontally oriented plank, which angles gently down to the right, meeting a juncture where a cluster of planks comes together. At the base of this juncture, a lengthwise plank meets the floor. Here, at the right side of the sculpture, pieces of wood rise up in a V-shape. One arm of the V has a two-foot-long nail anchored into it. At their highest points, each of these two arms has a thin rope attached to it. Each rope connects to the other highest peaks of the sculpture. There are three ropes in all, pulled taut, creating a sense of tension or strain between the wooden arms.
