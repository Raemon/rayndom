Opening reception:

5:30 p.m. – 7:30 p.m

These three artists share an interest in formalism, abstract patterns, and repetition. Martin’s sculptures are made of found objects, which she manipulates by tying, joining, binding, grouping, stacking, bundling, folding, bending, twisting, wrapping, or laminating. Del Mar’s work employs layers of oil on sheets of aluminum, drawing the eye deeper into the painting from the surface, and from the beveled edges toward the center. Canan Talon creates abstract canvases with complex repeating patterns reminiscent of a television screen with spotty reception.

**New World Order: Humanity  
**Ian MacLean, Kelly Ording, Flo Oy Wong, Robert Welsh   
June 4 – July 10, 2009  
Loft gallery

Opening reception:   
Thursday, June 4, 2009  
5:30 p.m. – 7:30 p.m

_New World Order_ is a series of five exhibitions held in the Loft Gallery. In each presentation, the artists explore the rapidly changing world through artworks with social, political, and ecological contexts.

For this segment, _Humanity_ , we feature four artists who deal with the common human experience. Some of the artworks address this theme in a personal context, such as Flo Oy Wong’s depictions of family relationships, whereas others address it in more social framework, such as Robert Welsh’s pieces, which capture evidence of human habitation in an urban landscape.
