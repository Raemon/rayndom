The Collections Center, SFMOMA’s collections research center in South San Francisco, is home to the museum’s archives and houses much of the museum’s collection when not on public view.

Collections Center Preparators are responsible for storing thousands of objects of all unique sizes and needs. This not only includes finding or creating the perfect space for an object in storage but can also involve building a new crate, travel frame, or other housing.
