SAN FRANCISCO, CA (January 15, 2026)–SFMOMA is thrilled to invite visitors and locals to enjoy a photo opportunity with the official Super Bowl LX Roman Numerals, on view for free in the museum’s Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Atrium from January 29 through February 8, 2026. To celebrate the Big Game and spotlight what makes the Bay Area a beacon in the fields of art, culture, technology, and sports, SFMOMA will also offer a range of programs, events, and products as part of its broader partnership with the Bay Area Host Committee (BAHC).

_PROGRAMS + EVENTS_

SFMOMA and the Museum of the African Diaspora (MoAD) invite you to spend an unforgettable evening in downtown San Francisco, moving between the neighboring museums and the artistic worlds they hold.

**Innovation Summit**

SFMOMA will be closed to the public on Friday, February 6, for the first BAHC SBLX Innovation Summit–a dynamic convergence of sport, technology, civic leadership and global storytelling. This invitation-only event will bring together 500 curated leaders from across tech, sports, venture capital, private equity and culture, uniquely convened by the Bay Area Host Committee. The Summit’s Main Stage Sessions will be shaped and moderated by Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal—the visionary hosts behind Acquired, the #1 technology podcast on Apple and Spotify—with afternoon breakout panels focused on how technology and innovation is shaping sports and major events.

**2–4 p.m.**

SFMOMA will present an immersive exploration of the history, styles, and culture of Bay Area graffiti and street art at this interactive workshop with rapper, graffiti artist, podcaster, and educator Dregs One.

As creator of the _History of the Bay_ podcast, Dregs One has collaborated extensively with artists across the region, tracing decades of the Bay Area’s graffiti and street art scene. In this workshop, he’ll provide a comprehensive overview of graffiti while spotlighting what makes the Bay Area’s scene distinctive. After introducing specific styles, Dregs will invite attendees to try their hand at the creative process.

During the second part of the workshop, Dregs will be joined by [Ruby Neri](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.davidkordanskygallery.com%2Fartist%2Fruby-neri&data=05%7C02%7Cchatcher%40SFMOMA.org%7C23bb86b9cd7b474385dc08de4d829b8e%7C038d95c6264f4455a11bb276013a6058%7C0%7C0%7C639033420522060294%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=kPTyYtciGOWeptOQeWwnBoXEl8NwpfNSfN3c%2Bf1bFtA%3D&reserved=0) to discuss their creative journey and examine how graffiti and street art have gained recognition in art history and institutional spaces like museums. More information [here](https://www.sfmoma.org/event/history-of-the-bay-street-art-and-graffiti/).

This program concludes a series of events presented by Dregs One celebrating a newly commissioned mural at 715 Harrison Street. The mural debuts Wednesday, February 4, with an on-site celebration, followed by a festival at Public Works on Friday, February 6.

**Sunday, February 8, 2026**

**10 a.m.–1 p.m.**

**Floor 2**

Calling all football fans!

Participation in this program is free and does not require museum admission. More information [here](https://www.sfmoma.org/event/family-studio-sports-pennants/).

_MUSEUM STORE_

During the month of February, and while supplies last, the SFMOMA Museum Store will carry two limited-edition hats designed in collaboration with the Bay Area Host Committee (BAHC) and LACES.

The first hat features the colors of the Big Game, reimagined through the Bay’s lens of culture, creativity and competition. With bold “BAY AREA” embroidery and the date of the Big Game—February 8, 2026—stitched on the back, the hat commemorates this iconic sporting event in the Bay.

The second hat celebrates the upcoming World Cup matches that the Bay Area will host at Levi’s Stadium, featuring “BAY AREA” embroidery in a signature black-and-gold palette. SFMOMA will be the first location to release this hat in honor of this year’s World Cup.

_SPECIAL EXHIBITIONS_

[**KAWS: FAMILY**](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/kaws-family/?gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=23096386034&gbraid=0AAAAACzvO2aKcDDYaYFdwyq3oCGV4GPMt&gclid=CjwKCAiAmp3LBhAkEiwAJM2JUB2hdHzcidrun38otGKyYEbLT-CFI_Q8nyNaKePw6Aie1A4f6H2QehoCySsQAvD_BwE)

**November 15, 2025–May 3, 2026**

Floor 4

_KAWS: FAMILY_ is a dazzling exploration of the multidimensional work of American artist KAWS. Marking the artist’s first major museum exhibition on the West Coast, it traces the artist’s output over the past three decades through its keen ability to connect to shared emotions and culture. From paintings, drawings and sculptures to advertising interventions, product collaborations and limited-edition collectible toys, visitors will encounter the many creative expressions of KAWS’s distinctive language using recurring characters and pop culture appropriations.

[**Alejandro Cartagena: Ground Rules**](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/alejandro-cartagena-ground-rules/)

**November 22, 2025–April 19, 2026**

Floor 3

_Alejandro Cartagena: Ground Rules_ is the first major retrospective of the acclaimed photographer, bringing together over two decades of his work through an expansive multi-series presentation. Born in the Dominican Republic and based in Monterrey, Mexico, Cartagena explores pressing social and environmental issues through a striking range of photographic practices that includes documentary images, collage, appropriated vernacular photographs and AI-generated video. His work captures the complexities of suburban sprawl, the US-Mexico border and increasing economic inequality. As visually dynamic as they are politically incisive, his photographs prompt viewers to question the systems that shape our world. Though rooted in Mexico, Cartagena’s photographic series speak to shared global conditions of migration, environmental crisis and unchecked development, offering a powerful reflection on the broader forces defining life in the 21st century.

[**Suzanne Jackson: What Is Love**](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/suzanne-jackson-what-is-love/)

**September 27, 2025–March 1, 2026**

Floor 7

For over six decades, Suzanne Jackson has created lyrical, awe-inspiring paintings influenced by her deep respect for the natural world and continual belief in the connection between all living things. Driven by a search for creative freedom and a bohemian spirit indebted to the San Francisco ethos of the 1950s and 1960s in which she was raised, Jackson has led an expansive artistic life, first and foremost as a painter, and as a dancer, poet, theater designer and an ardent supporter of other artists.
