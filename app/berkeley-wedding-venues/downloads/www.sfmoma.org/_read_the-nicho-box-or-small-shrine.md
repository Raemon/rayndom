# The Nicho Box or Small Shrine

by Amalia Mesa-Baines, November 2022 

### Activity

Two small shrines on the wall that are metal nicho boxes with pictures of nuns inside are part of the installation of _[Venus Envy, Chapter I: The First Holy Communion Moments Before the End](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/amalia-mesa-bains/)_ (1993/2022). The Vitrines offer a sense of the presentation of things precious to me including pictures of friends and family as well as special objects like my sister’s braids.

Many cultures have traditional forms of spirituality including home altars honoring the family and life events. The home altar often includes family photos as well as precious objects and religious or sacred objects, letters, and flowers and candles. Some special items are presented in small shrines or nicho boxes. The nicho box or niche highlights special objects by foregrounding them in the box like a small shrine.

This project invites you to make your own Nicho Box or Small Shrine. Will your Nicho Box pay tribute to or honor someone who is important in your life (family, friends, a deity, a teacher)? Will your Nicho Box honor a specific life event or moment in time? What images, objects, and materials will you use?

#### Materials

  * A basic box (a painted shoe box, boxes collected from a cigar store, discarded gift boxes, a small wooden crate, an old plastic container covered in paint or cloth)
  * Personal photos
  * Magazine images
  * Decorative papers
  * A favorite object
  * Natural objects like rocks, leaves, driftwood, or branches



#### Instructions

  1. The box serves as the base and the backdrop is created first with images from magazines, digital prints, or copies of family photos.
  2. Smaller boxes glued inside can be used as platforms inside the box to present smaller precious materials.
  3. The outside of the nicho box can also be decorated.



**Create an Exhibition of the Nicho Boxes:**  
The nicho boxes can be presented in class as an exhibition and students who are comfortable can share a little about their box and what is precious to them.
