Watch Me Wall Clock ($50) <https://museumstore.sfmoma.org/wamewacl.html>

Don’t settle for gift cards when you can find inspired presents for everyone on your list at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) MuseumStore. From fine art-inspired collectables to one-of-a-kind children’s toys, SFMOMA offers items you won’t find anywhere else, in all price ranges. The store carries unique jewelry pieces, exciting toys and gadgets, and an award-winning inventory of art books, gifts, and housewares. After a successful shopping trip, treat yourself to a Blue Bottle coffee on the rooftop, and celebrate the festive season with the bright colors of art in the many exhibitions on view at SFMOMA.

**For the Home**

Enjoy watching time go by with Denmark designer Rasmus Gottliebsen’s striking **Watch Me Wall Clock** ($50), modeled after a fan deck of paint chips. Artfully toast to the season with Frank Kerdil’s Mondrian-inspired **espresso cups** ($28) or the glass-and-stainless-steel **hot drink set**($55). The accolade-winning **Curve BT iDock** ($120) from French designer David Turpin charges your iPhone, syncs with iTunes, and connects two Bluetooth devices—all at the same time. The **Plus Salt and Pepper Grinder** ($75) is both fun and functional, making quick work of dispensing peppercorns or coarse salt.

**Jewelry and Watches**

Make your ensemble a little more artful with one of Owen McInerney’s **organic earring designs** (prices variable) or a unique **Zipper Flower Rin****g** ($20) designed by Doris Viñas. The **Layered Leaves Wood Necklace Mustard** ($72) is a lightweight but bold statement handmade from carved wooden leaves. Simple, handsome, and easy to read, Franklin Weisz’s **Big Index Watch**($190) features a platinum-toned face framed in black, a snazzy red second hand, and a date function.

**Personal Accessories**

Stay warm through the holidays with a cozy **Armi Loop Scarf** ($72) from indie New York company Verloop. Going green has never looked more chic with Wood Thumb’s whimsical **Wood Bowtie** ($35), made from reclaimed redwood. Ditch the plastic cover and swathe your wireless device in eco-friendly wood **iPhone Skins** ($25). The long-lasting skin adheres firmly, providing protection along with panache. Keep your wallet simple with the Argentina-designed **Planar Wallet** ($28), made of recycled leather sourced locally

**Kids**

Surprise the little ones with Jura Toy’s **slick Retro Scooter** ($95). The**Pantone Box of Color**($12.95), a boxed set from the color gurus at Pantone, devotes a board book to each color of the rainbow, exploring its many variations. Simple cutouts transform as kids turn the pages. The iconic gummy bear morphs into a **nightlight** ($30), giving new meaning to the phrase “eye candy.” Squeeze its soft plastic belly to turn its LED glow on and off—perfect for kids or kids at heart.

**Books**

In **Edible Selby** ($35), Selby focuses his lens on the kitchens, gardens, homes, and restaurants of more than 40 of the most creative and dynamic figures working in the culinary world today. Each profile is accompanied by a signature recipe. Jot notes in style with the **Christian Lacroix Voyage Travel Journal** ($39.95), an elegant hardbound journal with 96 ruled, gilt-edge pages for creative expression, plus pop-ups of six world-class cities. Have your cake and admire it too with **Wayne Thiebaud: A Retrospective**($45), a catalogue of Thiebaud’s work from the 1960s to the present day. **Apple Design** ($60) features over 200 examples of outstanding Apple designs by Jonathan Ive, the company’s senior vice president of industrial design, who since 1997 has been responsible for the design of all of Apple’s products.
