### Our Objective:

How do you publicly express your passion for a social issue you care about? Protest posters are a great way of creatively using text and images to demonstrate your stance on a problem, controversy, or debate. Historically, these types of posters have engaged the social and political themes of their time and place. A collective effort, this is your chance to find an ally, decide on an issue, and create your protest poster.

### How to make a protest poster:

**Part 1: Find a cause**  
What are you passionate about?  
Find an article on that issue.  
Within that article, find a sentence or a set of words that resonate with you.  
In six words or less, what would you tell someone about this issue?

**Part 2: Ask your community**  
Talk to people about this issue, and ask them the following questions:  
– Why is this important to you?  
– How much do you know about this?  
– What else do you think people need to know?

**Part 3: Write down eight words**  
Based on your interactions with others, decide what you want to say about this issue, and write it down in eight words or less.  
Hint: Your words should be immediate and easy to understand.

**Part 4: Make your poster**  
How can you best illustrate the words you have just written? Use paint or markers and write your words on your poster board. Choose a color that’s vibrant! Make sure that all the letters fill in the page. (The letters do not have to be the same size.) And _voilà,_ you’ve made your protest poster.

**Part 5:** **Distribute your poster**  
Find a place where you think people need to read this message and place the poster(s).
