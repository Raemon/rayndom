### Finding parallels between our expansion and our collection

From the moment we saw Snøhetta’s vision for our expanded building, we knew that the latest addition to our home would be more than a vessel for housing the masterpieces in our collection — it would be a work of art in its own right, just like the Botta building.

We also knew that we wanted to preserve the momentous process of building this new and very site-specific work. So we installed a camera overlooking the Howard Street end of the site for viewers to see each day’s progress and create their very own time-lapse movie. We also brought the architectural photographer Henrik Kam on board to roam the site, inside and out.

Kam’s photographs capture the initial destruction and ensuing construction of the site, and provide a preview of what’s to come in 2016 in some unexpected ways. From a bright tangle of wires that call to mind Julie Mehretu’s _Stadia I_ (2004)

to a dreamy reflection on the facade that evokes Richard Diebenkorn’s _Ocean Park #54_ (1972), many of Kam’s photographs conjure works from our collection, and we couldn’t resist the impulse to share a few of our favorite “work sites of art.”
