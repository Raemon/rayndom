At SFMOMA, we strive to foster an inclusive, rewarding, and inspiring place to work. Our people and the work we do reflect our four core, museum-wide values: 

  * **Inclusive:** We strive to be a museum of many voices in dialogue.
  * **Passionate:** We believe working with art is more than a job or a trusteeship—it is a way of life.
  * **Brave:** We are committed to approaching our work with courage and a sense of adventure.
  * **Empathic:** We aim to act like a person, not an institution.



Our working environment is meaningful and intentional—a place for our employees to embrace creativity, connection, diverse thinking, discussion, and education. We celebrate the differences and uniqueness that each person brings into our place of work, as we believe we all have something to learn from each other. 

From curatorial experts to museum store professionals, our employees are all driven by the same goal: to share the art of our time with passion and purpose. The theme of “caring” runs throughout our people-centered, empathetic community, where strong workplace relationships flourish and translate directly into our work.
