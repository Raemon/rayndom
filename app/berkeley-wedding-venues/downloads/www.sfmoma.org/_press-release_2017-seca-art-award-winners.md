### What:

Since 1967, SECA (Society for the Encouragement of Contemporary Art) has honored over 70 Bay Area artists with the SECA Art Award, which includes an exhibition at SFMOMA with an accompanying catalogue. 

The award honors Bay Area artists whose work has not, at the time of nomination, been accorded substantial recognition from a major institution. Recipients of the SECA Art Award are selected by SFMOMA curators after a 10-month process involving artists, SECA members and members of the Bay Area arts community. 230 nominations were received this year, from which 16 finalists were selected.
