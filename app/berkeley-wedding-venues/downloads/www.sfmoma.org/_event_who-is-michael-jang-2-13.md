Meet one of the coolest photographers you’ve maybe never heard of. _Who is Michael Jang?_ is a highly entertaining and captivating journey into the life and work of the enigmatic photographer Michael Jang, from relative obscurity to inclusion in the SFMOMA permanent collection. From capturing iconic moments in San Francisco’s history to exploring the complexities of identity and belonging, the film bears witness to Jang’s reacquaintance with his younger self through decades-old images that resonate with vital new meaning today. The screening will be followed by a special discussion offering insight into the film, Jang, and his mural currently on view as part of SFMOMA’s exhibition _Get in the Game_.
