### Who:

The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) announces the recipients of the 2019 SECA Art Award, selected from a list of 16 finalists:

  * **[Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle](https://www.kachstudio.com/)**
  * **[Sahar Khoury](https://www.sahar-khoury.com/)**
  * **[Marlon Mullen](http://niadart.org/marlon-mullen/)**



Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle’s interdisciplinary practice explores “the historical present,” her term for the persistent residue of history in contemporary life. Sahar Khoury transforms discarded materials into sculptures animated by freewheeling experimentation and personal narrative. Marlon Mullen takes magazine covers as his primary source imagery, translating them into vividly painted abstractions.

### What:

Since 1967, the SECA (Society for the Encouragement of Contemporary Art) Art Award has honored more than 70 Bay Area artists with an exhibition at SFMOMA and an accompanying publication.

The award distinguishes Bay Area artists whose work has not, at the time of nomination, been accorded substantial recognition from a major institution. Recipients of the SECA Art Award are chosen by SFMOMA curators after a series of studio visits attended by SECA members.
