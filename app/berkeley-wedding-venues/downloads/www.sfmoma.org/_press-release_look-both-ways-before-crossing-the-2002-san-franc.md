**What**  
The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art’s Architecture + Design Forum and the San Francisco Chapter of the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) present _Look Both Ways Before Crossing_ , this year’s installment of the annual San Francisco Design Lecture Series.

Now in its thirteenth year, the five-part Design Lecture Series features important designers from a broad range of disciplines including architecture, film, fashion, technology and graphic design. Martin Venezky of Appetite Engineers is chair of the series this year and designer of event collateral.

**Schedule**

Monday, April 22 – 7:30 p.m. – Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater  
General admission $20 per lecture or $80 for the series; students with current ID $15 per lecture or $60 for the series.**

As a designer for independent music labels, theaters and alternative publications, Art Chantry helped define the image and identity of Seattle’s late-twentieth century cultural renaissance with a community-conscious design vernacular.

**Ayse Birsel, Industrial Designer  
Monday, May 6 – 7:30 p.m. – Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater  
General admission $20 per lecture or $80 for the series; students with current ID $15 per lecture or $60 for the series.**

While working for industry leaders like Herman Miller, Knoll and Toto, Ayse Birsel has designed office systems and products that suggest a new way to live and work in the information age.

Monday, May 20 – 7:30 p.m. – Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater  
General admission $20 per lecture or $80 for the series; students with current ID $15 per lecture or $60 for the series.**

Since his days as creative director for the renowned advertising firms of Wieden & Kennedy and The Martin Agency, David “Jelly” Helm has been steering desire throughout the world with his innovative and award-winning campaigns. As a member of an advisory board to a United Nations environment program, he has turned his attention to the effect advertising has on sustainable consumption and usage of natural resources.

Monday, June 3 – 7:30 p.m. – Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater  
General admission $20 per lecture or $80 for the series; students with current ID $15 per lecture or $60 for the series.**

Photographer Camilo Vergara’s work reveals the history and explores the future of America’s hyperghettos, the forgotten spaces of the largest cities in the United States. His photographs form an important social commentary on the intrinsic cycle of urban construction and decay.

Monday, June 10 – 7:30 p.m. – Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater  
General admission $20 per lecture or $80 for the series; students with current ID $15 per lecture or $60 for the series.**
