### How did you get involved with SECA, and what do you enjoy most about it?

At the time, I was working with former SECA co-chair Rebecca Zeman. I expressed my sincere passion for, and involvement in, the Bay Area art scene. Rebecca kindly invited me to my first SECA event at the de Young museum— a Q&A with [curator-in-charge of contemporary art and programming] Claudia Schmuckli. I knew instantly that SECA was the art community I had been looking for in San Francisco.

### What is your favorite “art moment” with SECA?

All the events have provided that intimate moment with artists, curators, and art organizations bringing our art community together. The Djerassi Resident Artist program sculpture hike was remarkable.

### What about the local art scene gets you excited?

I’m continually amazed and appreciate having access to such talented artists and local exhibitions. Lower Nob Hill has a selection of must-see galleries, such as Hashimoto Contemporary, Modernism, Chandran Gallery, and Jessica Silverman Gallery.

### How would you describe the SECA community to a friend?

A welcoming Bay Area art community that provides the opportunity to expand your knowledge and exposure to existing and emerging contemporary artists.

### What’s something you might not have known about the local arts scene that SECA exposed you to?

Hunt Projects, The 500 Capp Street Foundation, and McEvoy Foundation for the Arts.

### Do you have a favorite space within the museum? One you like to spend most time in?

I always take a moment to see the Ellsworth Kelly paintings and sculptures. Other highlights are walking over the Oculus Bridge and spending time in the roof top sculpture garden.
