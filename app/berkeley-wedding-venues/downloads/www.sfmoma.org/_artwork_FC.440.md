_SFX: Scraping. Footsteps. Slide of a brush. The sounds of Richter making a painting are the main experience of the sound design – the voices come in and out, but the physical sounds of the process are the constant._

NARRATOR: 

Those are the sounds of artist Gerhard Richter making one of his large abstract paintings.

RACHEL JANS: 

It’s a highly physical process that takes place over an extended period of time. 

NARRATOR: 

And that’s curator Rachel Jans. 

_SFX: Sharp scrape, footsteps_

JANS: 

Richter’s abstract pictures are built of a single layer by a single layer sometimes scraping them and removing paint, sometimes allowing layers of paint to merge. 

_SFX: Long sound of squeegee_

JANS:

One of the tools is a squeegee- a large squeegee- that he can pull across the painting, or down the painting so it actually moves layers of paint. 

_SFX: Long sound of squeegee_

JANS: 

It can blend the layers-

_SFX: The wet drips of paint, the slide of a brush. Sounds of scraping and smearing continue through Storr’s comments._

JANS: 

Remove layers, add layers.

_SFX: Big scrape, footsteps, as if the artist continues to work. Then fades with the music._
