In celebration of our [_Joan Brown_](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/joan-brown/) retrospective, SFMOMA is partnering with the San Francisco SPCA to bring you **Pet Portraits Day** , an exciting live art extravaganza. Joan Brown was known for her enduring love of animals, and you can find many depictions of cats and dogs (many of them her own pets) throughout the exhibition on Floor 7. With this inspiration in mind, meet us at the museum on February 4 and share a digital photo of your pet with us for the chance to receive a complimentary, original pet portrait made by a local artist.

**No pet? No problem. Everyone can enjoy watching the art-making experience unfold.** Some fifty Bay Area artists — plus participating kids ages 4 and up, working with SFMOMA Family Programs — will be setting up shop at their workstations on Floors 2 and 4 to create their portraits in a variety of mediums, from acrylic, watercolor, and gouache to pen-and-ink, collage, and clay. As they complete their works throughout the day, a selection of finished portraits will be displayed in the Gina and Stuart Peterson White Box on Floor 4, staying on view through February 6. (And if your pet photo is selected for a portrait, you’ll receive your artwork in the mail in the weeks following the event!) 

As part of our partnership, we’ve commissioned artist Nora Aoyagi to be in residency with the San Francisco SPCA and create sample pet portraits in advance of our event. During this time, Aoyagi made watercolor portraits of four long-stay animals. All the animals featured in these works have since been adopted (great news!), but the SF SPCA has many more who are looking for loving homes. To see their available animals, please visit [www.sfspca.org/adopt](https://www.sfspca.org/adoptions/).

While you’re onsite, you can grab a free print of one of Aoyagi’s works from [The Mobile Art Share](https://mobileartsplatform.wordpress.com/about/) bicycle. And don’t forget to say “hi” to the [SF SPCA’s Animal Assisted Therapy Team](https://www.instagram.com/sanfranciscospca/) making a special Pet Portraits Day Appearance.
