#### Key Concepts

  * Materials and Process
  * Repetition
  * Choices artists make



#### Materials

  * Construction paper (light colors are best)
  * Styrofoam plate or container, or a sheet of craft foam
  * Scissors
  * Ruler
  * Pencil
  * Stamp pad or paint (tempera, finger paint, or print-making ink)



#### Introduction

  * What was the first thing you noticed about this work? Why do you think that caught your eye?
  * Look at the colors in this work. Why do you think these colors were used?
  * This work shows an image of the actress Elizabeth Taylor. How many times does her image appear?
  * Are all of the images of Taylor exactly alike? How are they the same or different?



#### Instructions

  1. Cut a 3″ x 3″ square out of a Styrofoam plate or container or sheet of craft foam.
  2. Using a dull pencil, draw an image—a person, animal, or everyday object—on the Styrofoam square. Press firmly enough to make an indented impression but be careful not to push the pencil through.
  3. Using an ink pad or paint, coat your Styrofoam drawing evenly.
  4. Choose a piece of 9″ x 12″ construction paper for your background.
  5. Starting at the top corner of the paper, place the wet side on the paper and press down.
  6. Gently lift the Styrofoam to reveal a print of your image on the paper.
  7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the piece of construction paper is covered with your repeated image.



#### Variation

If you don’t have a Styrofoam plate or container, a large potato cut in half will also work! Draw your image on the cut edge of the potato and cover that surface with ink or paint to make your print.

#### Relevant Information

Andy Warhol liked to make works of art about everyday products you could buy in stores (like soup and shoes) as well as images of celebrities—famous people. He liked to repeat the same image over and over. To him, making art wasn’t that different from a production line in a factory.

#### Discussion

  * What person or object did you choose for your artwork? Why?
  * What colors did you use for your artwork? Why did you choose those colors?
  * Do all the printed images look the same, or are there differences?
