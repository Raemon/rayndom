_After January 25, the Fisher Collection galleries will temporarily close as we reimagine how these works are experienced across the museum. The full suite of exhibitions will reopen mid-April._

Exploring abstract art since 1950, this presentation brings together artists who employ abstraction to express the intangible and ineffable, inviting a range of interpretations and responses. The works on view demonstrate a broad range of techniques, from gestural brushstrokes that record the act of making to sumptuous monochromatic explorations of shape and hue. The breadth of these approaches underscores the idea that abstraction is constantly being redefined.

This exhibition, along with presentations on Floors 5 and 6, is the result of an innovative partnership established in 2009 between the Fisher Art Foundation and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Bringing together works from the Fisher Collection and the museum’s permanent collection, these installations offer expansive ways of looking at the strengths of each.
