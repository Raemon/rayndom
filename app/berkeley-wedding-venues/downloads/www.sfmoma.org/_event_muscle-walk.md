Join journalist and author [**Bonnie Tsui**](https://www.bonnietsui.com/) for a special walk-through of _Get in the Game_ , focusing on what moves us — muscles. In her new book _[On Muscle](https://bookshop.org/p/books/on-muscle-the-stuff-that-moves-us-and-why-it-matters-bonnie-tsui/21716153?ean=9781643753089)_ , Tsui blends science, culture, investigative reporting, and personal narrative to explore not just what muscles are but what they mean to us. From how the body morphs depending on the playing field to the complexities of body image and the factors that shape it, Tsui will reflect on how artworks in _Get in the Game_ invite us to consider the muscles we metaphorically and literally flex. She’ll also delve into the physicality of crowds and the ecstatic joy of fandom. Designed for visitors of all ages, each session lasts approximately 30 minutes and is for an intimate audience.
