From April 5 to August 3, 2003 the San Francisco Museum of Art (SFMOMA) will present _Reel Sculpture: Film into Art_. Organized by Benjamin Weil, SFMOMA curator of media arts, this exhibition emphasizes the viewer’s physical relationship with the projected image and explores the possibilities for nonlinear and seamless narratives in film and video. The exhibition features installations by international filmmakers Eija-Liisa Ahtila, Atom Eyogan and Abbas Kiarostami.

Finnish director **Eija-Liisa Ahtila** describes her work _The Present_ as a “human drama”. The installation consists of five monitors running loops of stories that expose moments of psychological instability in the lives of five female protagonists. Ahtila’s stories shift between the past and the present without having to rely on the typical cinematic “flashback” technique, creating a nonlinear narrative. An underlying theme of forgiveness is revealed after each short story with the words: “Give Yourself a Present; Forgive Yourself”. _The Present_ was shown recently in 2002 at the Tate Modern and at the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki.

**Atom Egoyan** ‘s _Close,_ a collaborative work with visual artist Juliao Sarmento, premiered at the 2001 Biennale di Venezia. The viewer experiences the video in close physical proximity to the screen in a narrow corridor. The projected image amplifies feet, hands and freshly clipped crescent-shaped toenails as, one by one, they fall delicately onto a woman’s tongue. Atom Egoyan is an Egyptian-born Canadian filmmaker who began to explore the art and language of cinema while studying in Toronto. Egoyan’s films delve into issues of intimacy and displacement along with examining the impact of technology and media on society.

_Sleepers,_ by renowned Iranian filmmaker **Abbas Kiarostami** was also shown at the 2001 Biennale di Venezia. It portrays a life-sized sleeping couple projected on the floor. The projection relies on a soundtrack of street noises that causes certain occurrences to take place within the couple’s dreams. Abbas Kiarostami was the recipient of the San Francisco Film Society’s prestigious Akira Kurosawa Award in 2000. _Sleepers_ is a part of the SFMOMA Media Arts permanent collection.

_Reel Sculpture: Film into Art_ is made possible by the generous support of the James Family Foundation.

To complement the work in the exhibition, additional films by Ahtila, Egoyan and Kiarostami will be screened in the Phyllis Wattis Theater as part of _The Seventh Art: New Dimensions in Cinema_. More information on _The Seventh Art_ is available on the Museum’s Web site at www.sfmoma.org/press._The Seventh Art: New Dimensions in Cinema_ is generously supported by the Susan Wildberg Morgenstein Fund. Media sponsor: SFSTATION.COM. Hotel sponsor: Triton Hotel.

**Thursday, April 10, 7 p.m.  
_Family Viewing_  
By Atom Egoyan, 1987, 96 minutes  
Followed by a discussion with Atom Egoyan, director**

This story of mistaken and found identities is set in a nursing home, a condominium and a telephone-sex establishment. Using a collection of video images—television, pornography, home movies and surveillance—the film observes the breakdown and restoration of a dislocated family. Darkly humorous and unpredictable, _Family Viewing_ is a journey into a world of brutality and sentimentality.

**Thursday, May 8, 7 p.m.  
_Love Is a Treasure_  
By Eija-Liisa Ahtila, 2002, 55 minutes  
Followed by a discussion with director Eija-Liisa Ahtila of the relationship between this film and her installation _The Present_ (on view as part of _Reel Sculpture: Film into Art_). Both works share the same plot.**

_Love Is a Treasure_ features five vignettes about five women who have developed psychoses. Through special effects that seamlessly situate impossibilities and hallucinations, each episode encompasses a psyche.

**Thursday, June 12, 7 p.m.  
_Close Up_  
By Abbas Kiarostami, 1999, 90 minutes, in Farsi with English subtitles  
Remarks by Hamid Naficy, professor of art history and film and media studies, Rice University**

In present-day Tehran, Hossain Farazmand, a journalist, goes to cover the arrest of Hossain Sabzian, a young man accused of fraud. Earlier, Sabzian had persuaded the Ahankhah family that he was the well-known film director Mohsen Makhmalbaf, then borrowed money from them. Sabzian was arrested. Farazmand attempts to borrow a tape recorder. A documentary filmmaker (Kiarostami as himself) begins a documentary investigation of the case.
