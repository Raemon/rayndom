# Join Our SECA Membership

**Be a part of the Bay Area contemporary art scene.**

SECA celebrates the local art scene, building community among creatives and the art-curious through monthly educational and social programs. SECA members enjoy tours and talks at local arts organizations, artist-run spaces, and more.

**Local Artists. Nominated by you. Exhibited at SFMOMA.**

One of the perks of SECA is members’ involvement in the biennial SECA Art Award. Every other year, SECA members are called upon to nominate local artists for this prestigious award and exhibition at SFMOMA. Members are invited to studio visits with finalists accompanied by SFMOMA curators, to get a sneak peek and gain insights on their work and process. Then, celebrate with SECA at the Art Award Opening Preview!

Alicia McCarthy, Barry McGee, Tauba Auerbach, and Hung Liu are among the more than seventy lauded recipients of the SECA Art Award, which was first introduced in 1967.

Eager to take your first step into the Bay Area arts community? Looking to connect with a group of fellow art enthusiasts?  
Join SECA today and be a part of something more. Enjoy tours of local galleries and arts non-profits, studio visits with cutting-edge local artists, and other social events while getting an inside scoop on the Bay Area arts scene.
