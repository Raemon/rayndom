Join us for [Canyon Cinema](https://canyoncinema.com/)’s inaugural film commissioning project! Borrowing its title from J.J. Murphy’s astounding structural showpiece, _Print Generation_ (1974), and inspired by the centennial of 16mm film (1923–2023), Print Generations was conceived to support analog-based filmmaking in the Bay Area. For this first iteration, three filmmakers — **Tijana Petrović, Amy Reid,** and **TT Takemoto** — were selected through an open call to create new cinematic works. No restrictions were imposed on the proposed films’ subject matter, style, or length. The only requirement was a commitment to working with 16mm. The newly created films screen for the first time at SFMOMA, complemented by works from the Canyon Cinema collection and selected by the Print Generations cohort. 

Print Generations is supported by the Owsley Brown III Philanthropic Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Phyllis C. Wattis Foundation. Technical support was provided by Oakland’s Black Hole Collective Film Lab, a DIY community resource center and art studio based in West Oakland.

### About the Filmmakers

**Tijana Petrović** is a filmmaker, cinematographer, and educator born and raised in Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia). Her nonfiction films and moving image installations use landscape as a framework through which to observe and question our relationships to history, place, and the natural world. Her recent film _A Field Guide to Coastal Fortifications_ had its World Premiere at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2023 and won the Best Film Award in the National Competition at the 16th Beldocs IDFF. Petrović is a graduate of the Documentary Film and Video MFA program at Stanford University. She is currently a lecturer in the Film and Media Department at UC Berkeley. 

**Amy Reid** is an artist and filmmaker whose work examines the intersections between gender, national identity, and labor. By exploring observational approaches and expanding upon formal cinematic notions of time, structure, and narrative, Reid’s work questions how labor is constructed in the filmic form through feature length films, video installations, and texts. These multi-year projects, often working closely with a group — long haul female truckers, quilters, e-commerce sellers — premise upon collaboration, performance, and experimentation. Reid received her MFA from the University of California, San Diego. Currently she is a PhD Candidate in Film and Digital Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 

**TT Takemoto** is a queer Japanese American filmmaker exploring hidden dimensions of same-sex intimacy in Asian American history. Takemoto manipulates archival and found footage through labor-intensive processes of painting, scratching, and lifting 35mm/16mm emulsion. By engaging tactile dimensions of the archive, Takemoto conjures up immersive queer historical fantasies honoring Asian Americans who lived, loved, and labored together. Takemoto has exhibited widely and received grants from Art Matters, Fleishhacker Foundation, and San Francisco Arts Commission. Takemoto was awarded the Grand Jury Prize for Best Experimental Film at Slamdance and Best Experimental Film Jury Award at Austin Gay and Lesbian International Film Festival.
