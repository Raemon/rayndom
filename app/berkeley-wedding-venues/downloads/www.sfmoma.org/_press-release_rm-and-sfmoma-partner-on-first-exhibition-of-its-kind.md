**RM x SFMOMA**

**October 2026 – February 2027**

SAN FRANCISCO, CA (October 2, 2025)—The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) announces _**RM x SFMOMA,** _the first museum exhibition featuring artworks from the personal collection of RM, of 21st century pop icons BTS, and curated by RM with exhibition co-curators América Castillo and Hyoeun Kim of SFMOMA. In an exclusive U.S. presentation at SFMOMA from October 2026 to February 2027, this exhibition will bring together 200 works from the collections of RM and SFMOMA, offering a rare chance to see modern Korean artworks in conversation with contemporary artworks from around the world. Many of the artworks have never before been exhibited to the public.

“We live in an age defined by boundaries. This exhibition at SFMOMA reflects those boundaries: between East and West, Korea and America, the modern and the contemporary, the personal and the universal. I don’t want to prescribe how these works should be seen; whether out of curiosity or study, all perspectives are welcome. My only hope is that this exhibition can be a small but sturdy bridge for many,” said RM.

Drawn to the artist’s thoughtfully assembled collection of modern and contemporary art, SFMOMA invited RM to curate the first exhibition to showcase his collection in this collaborative presentation.

“Visitors will have an unprecedented opportunity to explore RM’s beautiful and contemplative collection of paintings and sculpture in dialogue with works from SFMOMA’s holdings, inviting us to make new discoveries and reflect on our own relationships with art,” said Janet Bishop, Thomas Weisel Family Chief Curator at SFMOMA.

Among the key figures of modern and contemporary Korean art represented in the collection of RM are **Yun Hyong-keun, Park Rehyun, Kwon Okyon,** **Kim Yun Shin, To Sangbong** and **Chang Ucchin,** in addition to works by numerous notable contemporary artists based around the world. _RM x SFMOMA_ will highlight resonances and themes shared among these works and complementary SFMOMA collection artworks by Korean artist **Kim** **Whanki** as well as American and European artists such as **Mark Rothko, Agnes Martin, Henri Matisse, Georgia O’Keeffe** and**Paul Klee.**
