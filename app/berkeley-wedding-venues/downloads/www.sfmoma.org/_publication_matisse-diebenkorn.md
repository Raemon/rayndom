Edited by Janet Bishop and Katherine Rothkopf

Foreword by Christopher Bedford and Neal Benezra; essays by Janet Bishop, John Elderfield, Jodi Roberts, and Katherine Rothkopf; bibliography of Matisse publications in Diebenkorn’s library 

184 pages, 9 ⅝ x 11 inches, hardcover

Published in 2016

Featuring stunning pairings of more than one hundred paintings and drawings, this sumptuously illustrated book brings together the work of Henri Matisse (1869–1954) and Richard Diebenkorn (1922–1993) as never before. Though they never met, Matisse was an enduring source of inspiration for the American artist, and their works share surprising similarities in subject, composition, palette, and technique. Essays by Janet Bishop and Katherine Rothkopf explore how this influence evolved over time, connecting the work of the two painters and highlighting the ways Diebenkorn drew from Matisse’s example to forge a style entirely his own. This extraordinary volume is rounded out by an introductory essay by John Elderfield, who knew Diebenkorn personally and has curated major exhibitions of both artists’ work; an essay by Jodi Roberts on parallels between the drawings of Diebenkorn and Matisse; and an annotated bibliography documenting Diebenkorn’s collection of books about the French artist. Like the exhibition it accompanies, this publication is the first in-depth examination of the relationship between the work of Diebenkorn and Matisse and offers new ways of understanding both artists.

Published in association with The Baltimore Museum of Art and DelMonico Books/Prestel on the occasion of the exhibition _Matisse/Diebenkorn,_ held at The Baltimore Museum of Art (October 23, 2016–January 29, 2017) and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (March 11–May 29, 2017)
