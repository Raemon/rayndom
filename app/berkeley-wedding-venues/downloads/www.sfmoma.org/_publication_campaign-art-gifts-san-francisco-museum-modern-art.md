Initiated in 2009, SFMOMA’s Campaign for Art brought together the insight of curators from every discipline and the commitment of collectors from all over the Bay Area and beyond, with the goal of filling gaps and building on existing strengths in the museum’s holdings. Their combined efforts resulted in gifts and promised gifts of more than three thousand works of art from more than two hundred donors to the SFMOMA collection. This book features more than three hundred of these works, highlighting the range and quality of art committed and acquired through the Campaign.

Published on the occasion of the museum’s 2016 opening following a major expansion
