# School Visits

Museum experiences are a great way to encourage students to draw connections between art and their own lives, apply concepts learned in the classroom in a new context, and help develop critical and creative thinking skills. Teachers and their students are invited to explore the museum either with a Museum Guide or on a Self-Guided Visit. All scheduled school visits are free of charge for students and up to eight chaperones (including the teacher) per class.

### Scheduling

**Guided tours at the museum are available for grades 3-12. Self-guided visits are available for grades K-12. There will be no guided tours of the _KAWS: FAMILY_ exhibition. Self-guided visits to those exhibitions are limited and scheduled on a first come, first served basis and limited to groups of 20 or less.** Higher education faculty can email [tours@sfmoma.org](mailto:tours@sfmoma.org) to request a self-guided visit.

Please note that the museum does not open to the public on Thursdays until noon.

The museum continues to adhere to all state, county, and city COVID-19 policies and endeavors to make any visit to the museum as safe as possible. The museum’s official health and safety guidelines can be found in our [visitor toolkit](https://www.sfmoma.org/visit/visitor-guidelines/) and will be updated in accordance with any changes that might impact you.

Be sure to check our [Teacher Resources](https://www.sfmoma.org/teacher-resources/) page for art projects, artist-designed activities, videos, animations, and discussion questions you can use with your students to explore artworks from SFMOMA’s collection.

Questions? Please contact the School Visits office at [schoolvisits@sfmoma.org](mailto:schoolvisits@sfmoma.org).
