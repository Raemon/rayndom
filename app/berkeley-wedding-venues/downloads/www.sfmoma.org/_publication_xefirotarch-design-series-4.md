Published in 2006

From his 2002 Landmark Tower/U2 Studio proposal for Dublin to his 2005 installation at P.S.1 in New York, the Argentinean-born, Los Angeles–based architect Hernán Díaz Alonso is known for evolving alien, organlike forms into habitable structures. His studio, Xefirotarch, is the focus of the fourth installment of SFMOMA’s Design Series, which highlights work by architects and designers at the forefront of their respective disciplines. In a dynamic, cinematic style that mirrors Díaz Alonso’s creative process, this catalogue — published on the occasion of his first solo museum exhibition — explores his diverse projects and influences, which range from contemporary painting and sculpture to science-fiction films.

Published on the occasion of the exhibition _Xefirotarch/design series 4,_ held at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (March 31–September 17, 2006), The Art Institute of Chicago (July 11–October 28, 2007), MAK—Austrian Museum of Applied Arts/Contemporary Art, Vienna (2007), and the Architectural Association, London (2007)
