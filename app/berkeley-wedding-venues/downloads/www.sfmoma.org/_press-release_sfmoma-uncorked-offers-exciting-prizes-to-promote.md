From now through March 15, 2011, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) is offering visitors a chance to win amazing wine-related experiences while saving our natural resources with the contest SFMOMA Uncorked!

In celebration of SFMOMA’s groundbreaking exhibition _How Wine Became Modern:_ _Design + Wine 1976 to Now_ , on view through April 17, SFMOMA Uncorked! entices visitors to drop off used natural wine corks in the museum’s Haas Atrium with the chance to win monthly prizes. Winners will receive a variety of gifts, all donated by the Sonoma County Tourism Bureau, such as tickets to the Artisan Cheese Festival, Passport to Dry Creek Valley and Savor Sonoma Valley. A Grand Prize drawing will be held in March for a **Northern California Luxury Wine Adventure** , a week-long vacation for two throughout San Francisco, Napa, and Sonoma.

This limited-time contest promotion is sponsored by 100% Cork and benefits Cork ReHarvest, organizations dedicated to promoting the use of natural corks to preserve and protect the Mediterranean cork forests rather than environmentally unfriendly plastic corks and metal screw tops. 100% Cork explains, “In addition to preserving wine and allowing it to age properly, natural cork is one of the world’s most sustainable products. It’s biodegradable, recyclable and promotes the stewardship of vast cork oak forests in the Mediterranean Basin. The trees are not harmed or cut down but merely harvested for a portion of their bark every nine years over a 250-year lifespan. In addition to preventing desertification and providing habitat, the cork oak forests offset the carbon from 21 million automobiles every year. By contrast, artificial plastic wine stoppers or screw caps use at least five times more energy per ton to produce before millions of them end up in our landfills and oceans. It may seem like a little thing, but demanding natural cork is something we can all do to help our planet while enjoying the romance and tradition of wine.” 

**The Grand Prize**

· A two-night stay at W San Francisco, where a twist on the familiar surprises and the surprisingly new delights; an evening of tasting at Press Club, an urban wine bar; and an SFMOMA membership

· A two-night stay at Meadowood Napa Valley, the valley’s first luxury resort; a day of wine tasting with their master sommelier Gilles de Chambure; and dinner for two with wine pairings at The Restaurant at Meadowood, prepared by Michelin-rated chef Christopher Kostow

· A two-night stay at the Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn and Spa, the ultimate wine country destination oasis; dinner for two at the award-winning restaurant Santé; and two spa treatments or rounds of golf.

· Plus, ever wonder where that little piece of cork in your wine bottle came from? Courtesy of our contest partner Cork ReHarvest, you’ll tour a cork facility in Sonoma where you’ll learn why natural cork is the most sustainable and environmentally friendly closure for wine.

**About 100% Cork**

Contest sponsor 100% Cork is a campaign to educate U.S. wine consumers about the benefits of choosing wine with natural cork stoppers because of cork’s environmental, technical and societal advantages. The campaign seeks to recruit and organize wine consumers to request that winemakers and retailers choose natural cork over artificial stoppers. Please go to 100percentcork.org to learn more about cork and to take the pledge asking retailers to increase their reliance on cork. The campaign is funded by the Portuguese Cork Association and the Cork Quality Council. 

**About Cork ReHarvest**

Founded in 2008, Cork ReHarvest is a leader in the cork recycling movement in the United States and Canada, helping to collect and recycle some of the billions of natural corks that are produced each year. Equally important is its work to educate the public about the vital importance of preserving and protecting the Mediterranean cork forests. Cork ReHarvest also partners with the food, beverage, and hospitality industries to collect cork at restaurants, hotels, wine bars, and convention and performing arts centers.

**About the Exhibition**

_How Wine Became Modern: Design + Wine 1976 to Now_ explores the visual and material culture of wine over the past three decades, offering a fresh way of understanding the contemporary culture of wine and the role that design has played in its transformation. Organized by Henry Urbach, SFMOMA’s Helen Hilton Raiser Curator of Architecture and Design, and developed in close collaboration with interdisciplinary artists/architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro, _How Wine Became Modern_ marks the first exhibition to consider modern, global wine culture as an integrated yet expansive and richly textured set of cultural phenomena.
