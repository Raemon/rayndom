# Ticket Donation Requests

Thank you for your interest in receiving donation tickets from SFMOMA. 

Please note, we grant two guest passes valued at $30 each for nonprofit fundraising events. The total value of this donation is $60. Each pass allows one individual entrance to the museum for a single visit at any time. 

Museum hours and other important information, including a list of current and upcoming exhibitions, can be found on our website at [sfmoma.org](https://www.sfmoma.org/). 

Requests must be submitted a minimum of 60 days, but no more than 120 days, before your event. 

Tickets issued as a donation may never be sold and may not be auctioned/traded/raffled via online/social media sites (i.e., Facebook, eBay, Craigslist). SFMOMA reserves the right to void any tickets used in this manner without notification, compensation, or replacement. 

To be considered for a donation ticket, please submit the above information using this form.
