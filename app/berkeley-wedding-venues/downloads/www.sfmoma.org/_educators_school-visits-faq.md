# School Visits FAQ

###  How do I schedule a tour? 

Expand details

We are scheduling guided and self-guided visits. To request a tour, complete and submit either the [Guided Tour Application](https://sfmoma.wufoo.com/forms/fall-2024-guided-school-tour-application/) or the [Self-Guided Visit Application](https://sfmoma.wufoo.com/forms/selfguided-school-visit-application-fall-2024/) by the deadline indicated on the application. Requests are not accepted by phone or fax. Due to the high volume of applications, we may be unable to accommodate all tour requests.

###  What should I do when I arrive at SFMOMA for my scheduled visit? 

Expand details

For self-guided visits, please go to Coat Check on Floor 1 in the atrium near the Third Street entrance to check in. For guided tours, an SFMOMA School Guide will meet you at the Minna Street entrance. Please arrive on time; we may not be able to accommodate late arrivals. Groups will not be able to enter the museum before their scheduled tour time.

###  What bus and bus parking options are available? 

Expand details

There are white zones for drop off and pick up on Third Street and Mission Street. SFMOMA does not have bus parking. Bus drivers should check with the bus company about parking options.

SFMOMA offers a limited number of bus scholarships for SFUSD schools. For more information, contact the School Visits Scheduling Office at [schoolvisits@sfmoma.org](mailto:schoolvisits@sfmoma.org).

###  Does SFMOMA have a place where my students can eat lunch? 

Expand details

The museum allows students and chaperones to eat lunch on the steps near Steps Coffee and in the Haas Atrium lobby. Food and drink are not permitted in other parts of the museum. We ask that all trash be disposed of properly.

###  What if I have to cancel or change my scheduled visit? 

Expand details

If you have to cancel or change your scheduled visit, please email the School Visits Office at [schoolvisits@sfmoma.org](mailto:schoolvisits@sfmoma.org) at least three weeks in advance of your visit date. Teachers who cancel their scheduled visit less than two weekdays in advance will not be eligible to schedule tours for one academic year. Please note that we cannot accommodate multiple schedule changes, so select your tour date carefully.

###  If I do not have a scheduled visit, are my students required to pay admission? 

Expand details

Admission is free for visitors 18 and younger. Adult chaperones are required to pay admission. The museum requires 1 chaperone for every ten students. All unscheduled groups must wait in the general admission line to obtain tickets.

###  How should I prepare my class for a visit to SFMOMA? 

Expand details

Check out our online [teacher resources](https://www.sfmoma.org/educators/teacher-resources/) for lesson plans, artist interviews, gallery activities, and more.

Please break the group into pods of 10 or less. Each pod must have designated a leader. Before coming to SFMOMA, please read the [Covid-19 Visitor Guidelines](https://www.sfmoma.org/visit/visitor-guidelines/) and review the following expectations and guidelines with your students. Museums are very special places, full of objects that are collected, conserved, and studied. These objects are fragile and could be damaged if not treated with respect or if visitors fail to follow the rules listed.

  * No food and drink are permitted to be brought inside the museum at all.
  * Please do not touch the art. Remain behind floor markers, or 18 inches away from the artwork.
  * No pens in the galleries; use only pencils.
  * Photography is allowed for personal, non-commercial use. No flash, tripods, or selfie-sticks are allowed.
  * Photography may be restricted in certain exhibitions.
  * Do not run in the galleries.
  * Speak quietly.
  * Refrain from talking on the cell phone.
  * Backpacks must be worn in front of the body or below the waist in the galleries. Some backpack storage is available.



###  How do I prepare my chaperones for a visit to SFMOMA? 

Expand details

Because you and your chaperones are responsible for the behavior and safety of your students while at SFMOMA, it is important to remind chaperones that they must stay with their specified groups for the entire visit and help students respect the guidelines outlined previously. Please remember that the Museum requires 1 chaperone for every 10 students.

###  May I remain in the museum with my students after the tour? 

Expand details

After the tour ends, you and your students are welcome to remain in the museum as long as you wish until the galleries close. **Please note that the museum does not open to the public on Thursdays until noon. If you have a guided tour on Thursday morning, your group will have to exit the museum after your tour and return when the museum opens at noon.** Backpack storage may be possible after your tour. Please check with coat check on Floor 1. (During the tour, we will store all belongings in the classroom.)

###  Is there imagery that may be inappropriate for my students? 

Expand details

As a museum of modern and contemporary art, SFMOMA often exhibits artwork with challenging content and imagery that you may deem inappropriate for young visitors. If this concerns you, we suggest you preview the artwork before visiting the museum with your students. Contact [schoolvisits@sfmoma.org](mailto:schoolvisits@sfmoma.org) to set up a free preview of the museum (teachers only).
