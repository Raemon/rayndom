#### _About_

Oakland-based artist Sadie Barnette uncovers and reanimates stories of resistance, resilience, and love through an ongoing retelling of her family’s history. _SPACE/TIME,_ a site-specific commission developed in dialogue with _[Afterimages: Echoes of the 1960s from the Fisher and SFMOMA Collections](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/afterimages-pop-art-and-beyond-from-the-fisher-and-sfmoma-collections/),_ celebrates life against the backdrop of political turmoil and everyday moments from the 1960s to today, highlighting intergenerational legacies and collective possibilities. 

Just as personal and political events collide and coexist in life, Barnette’s mural juxtaposes cellphone snapshots of birthday parties and weddings with large-scale images of her father in his army uniform in 1966, before he left for Vietnam, and in 1968, as a Black Panther after he returned. Barnette also revisits her own visual language, reusing images that recur in her work, such as pictures of a Martin Luther King Jr. Drive street sign, her aunt’s living room, and sparkly musical equipment. These references appear alongside self-portraits, items from her studio—including a jewel-encrusted calculator and a Hello Kitty Fizzy Pop—and her frequently used adornments: spray paint, glitter, and rhinestones. Drawings with the phrases “Right Here,” “Right Now,” “Everything,” and “Forever” consider the elasticity of time, while the tinted window featuring the words “Space” and “Time” envelops the surrounding architecture with Barnette’s signature pink. By bringing together cosmic imagery and a picture of her father in a swirling pink void, Barnette collapses the expansive arc of time that connects generations and dimensions.
