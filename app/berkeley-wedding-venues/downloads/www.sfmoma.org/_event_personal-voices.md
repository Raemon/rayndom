The San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI) Film Department was founded in the late 1960s by Robert Nelson and Lawrence Jordan and for over 50 years attracted young artists who were excited by film as a form of poetic expression. The exceptional faculty — George Kuchar, James Broughton, Gunvor Nelson, Ernie Gehr, Al Wong, Janis Crystal Lipzin, Steve Anker, and the department’s founders — encouraged students to find their voices and stretch artistic boundaries in ways that reflected San Francisco’s freedom of lifestyle and radical experimentation. This first of two programs, curated by Steve Anker and Mark Wilson, includes films that were made by alumni and others at SFAI while they were at the institute or in their later lives. Today’s selection can only begin to suggest the range and richness of the work made during the department’s existence.

Stay for part two of the program, [Orbiting Bodies](https://www.sfmoma.org/event/orbiting-bodies/), at 3 p.m.
