In celebration of the opening weekend of [_People Make This Place: SFAI Stories,_](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/people-make-this-place-sfai-stories/) join us for a special screening that lets you see the San Francisco Art Institute campus as the celebrity it has always been. **Becky Alexander** and **Jeff Gunderson** , the team behind the [San Francisco Art Institute Legacy Foundation + Archive](https://www.sfailegacyarchive.org/), maintain a living history of the school, and also find, share, and offer access to these stories. In this special interactive program, they have compiled a show of the many films and other media where the SFAI campus has made a guest appearance. Becky and Jeff will share insights and comments about the clips, the campus, and the archive, while also inviting you into the conversation.

### About SFAI Legacy Foundation + Archive

The SFAI Legacy Foundation + Archive (SFAI LF+A) was established in response to the 2022 closure of the San Francisco Art Institute, one of the country’s oldest and most influential art schools. The SFAI LF+A preserves and shares the school’s expansive archive — an extraordinary collection of institutional records, photographs, film and video recordings, posters, blueprints, objects, and other ephemera dating back to 1871. Through public programs, exhibitions, and research access, the Foundation keeps SFAI’s radical legacy of experimentation and creativity alive.
