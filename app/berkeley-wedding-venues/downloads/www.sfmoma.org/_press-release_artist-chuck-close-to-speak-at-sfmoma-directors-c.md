**Who**  
American artist Chuck Close will be the guest of honor and featured speaker at SFMOMA’s sixteenth annual Director’s Circle lecture and dinner.

Born in 1940, Chuck Close has been a leading figure in contemporary art since the early 1970s. Over the years, his works have evolved from black-and-white images to colorful and brightly patterned canvases; he is best known for the monumental heads he has painted in visibly gridded formats. His images are executed in a wide variety of media, including painting, etching, photography, printmaking and works on paper. Close chooses his subjects from among his family and friends, from unidentified individuals to well-known members of the art world.

**What**  
The Director Circle lecture and black-tie dinner are organized in recognition of major donors to the Museum. Annual donors of $10,000 or more are members of SFMOMA’s Director’s Circle. _Attendance is by invitation only_.

Co-chaired by SFMOMA Trustees Gretchen Leach and Norah Sharpe Stone, the event is generously sponsored by Bank Julius Baer & Co., Ltd.; Sotheby’s; and Sotheby’s International Realty.

The dinner will be catered by MeMe Pederson of Taste Catering. The Evelyn and Walter J. Haas Atrium will be transformed into an elegant dining room with original decorations by event architect Robert W. Fountain Design. Peter Michael Winery will donate the wine.

6:30 p.m. Lecture (promptly)  
  
7:00 p.m. Cocktails
