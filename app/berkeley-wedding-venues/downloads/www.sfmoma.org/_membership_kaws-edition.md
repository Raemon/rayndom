# Be Part of the KAWS: FAMILY Moment

Experience the West Coast debut of [_KAWS: FAMILY_](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/kaws-family/) with a membership unlike any we’ve offered before. The Supporter: KAWS Edition membership pairs all the benefits of SFMOMA membership with exclusive perks created in collaboration with KAWS — including a **complimentary KAWS figure** and limited-edition membership cards available only through this offer. You’ll also enjoy a year of free museum access for you and up to three guests, including repeat visits to _KAWS: FAMILY_ throughout the exhibition.

This membership doesn’t just get you into SFMOMA — it also gives you **free admission to more than 40 leading modern and contemporary art museums** across the U.S. and Canada, including the Guggenheim and Whitney in New York, MOCA in Los Angeles, and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. [Explore the full list of participating museums.](https://www.sfmoma.org/membership/reciprocal-benefits/)
