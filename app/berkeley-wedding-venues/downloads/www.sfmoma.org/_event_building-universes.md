**Building Universes: two exhibitions and two ways of imagining the world anew.**

[_Suzanne Jackson: What Is Love_](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/suzanne-jackson-what-is-love/) at SFMOMA illuminates the cosmos that one artist can create through a singular visionary practice, while [_UNBOUND: Art, Blackness & the Universe_](https://www.moadsf.org/exhibitions/unbound-art-blackness-the-universe) at the Museum of the African Diaspora (MoAD) reveals what becomes possible when artists from across the African Diaspora build cosmologies together where ideas spark ideas and worlds unfold in conversation.

MoAD and SFMOMA invite you to spend an unforgettable evening in downtown San Francisco, moving between our neighboring museums and the artistic worlds they hold. Inspired in part by the spirit of the 1972 Black Art Expo that Suzanne Jackson curated, **poets and dancers will offer original responses to both exhibitions within the galleries, animating these presentations with live performances.**

Travel between the two sites, follow the pathways of art and movement, and see how a new universe begins to take shape for you. Performances by poets and dancers will take place at MoAD and SFMOMA; each will repeat so attendees can see one performance at each institution.

**PERFORMANCE TIMES ARE THE SAME AT BOTH MUSEUMS:**  
First Performance: 5:15–6:15 p.m.  
Second Performance: 6:45‐7:45 p.m.
