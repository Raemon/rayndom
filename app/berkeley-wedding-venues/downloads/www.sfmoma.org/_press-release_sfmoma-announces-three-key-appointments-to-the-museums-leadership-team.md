SAN FRANCISCO, CA (March 1, 2019) — The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) today announced the appointment of three key leadership positions at the museum. Janet Bishop was named Thomas Weisel Family Chief Curator and Curator of Painting and Sculpture. In this role, she will be responsible for the development and implementation of the museum’s overall exhibition strategy, as well as governance and oversight of the curatorial division. Chad Coerver was appointed the Leanne and George Roberts Chief Education and Community Engagement Officer. He will be responsible for strategizing and developing education programs and interpretive programs that foster and deepen engagement for a diverse audience of adults, families and youth. Both positions will report to Neal Benezra, Helen and Charles Schwab Director of SFMOMA, and are effective immediately. Bishop and Coerver will also serve as members of the museum’s executive leadership team.

The museum also announced that Rebecca Malkin-Chocron will join SFMOMA as Director of Finance and will report to Janet Alberti, Deputy Museum Director of Administration and Finance, effective March 4, 2019.

“We are so fortunate to have Janet and Chad, two leaders with rich experience, strong relationships with the art community, expansive institutional knowledge and years of producing critically-acclaimed projects, ready to inspire and lead our teams to advance the goals of our new strategic plan,” said Benezra. “I am confident that through their creativity and leadership, we will continue to enhance our programs and collection, and deepen our bonds with artists and audiences.”

### About Janet Bishop

Janet Bishop has served as SFMOMA’s Curator of Painting and Sculpture since 2000. In her new role as Thomas Weisel Family Chief Curator and Curator of Painting and Sculpture, Bishop will lead the curatorial division’s 17 curators and associated staff, and have administrative responsibility for the museum’s five collecting departments — Painting and Sculpture, Photography, Architecture + Design, Media Arts and Contemporary Art — whose collections comprise nearly 47,500 works. In her new role, Bishop will oversee the implementation of SFMOMA’s new strategic plan as it relates to the museum’s exhibition and acquisition programs to bring greater diversity and dynamism. SFMOMA has presented more than 30 exhibitions each year since its expansion in 2016.

Over the course of her 30-year career at SFMOMA, Bishop has served as lead or co-curator for many of SFMOMA’s most important and critically acclaimed exhibitions. _Matisse/Diebenkorn_ (2016–17), was co-organized with the Baltimore Museum of Art, and _The Steins Collect: Matisse, Picasso and the Parisian Avant Garde_(2011–12), was a co-organized exhibition that premiered at SFMOMA and traveled to the Grand Palais, Paris and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. _The Steins Collect_ was awarded Outstanding Thematic Exhibition by the Association of Art Museum Curators (AAMC); Best Museum Show Nationally by the International Association of Art Critics (AICA); Outstanding New Catalogue by the Dedalus Foundation; and the Frick Book Prize.

Bishop was responsible for the current collection-based exhibitions _Wayne Thiebaud: Artist’s Choice_ and _Wayne Thiebaud: Paintings and Drawings_. Other exhibitions of note include _75 Years of Looking Forward: The Anniversary Show_ (2010–11), a major reinstallation of SFMOMA’s collection assembling some 400 works in all media; _Robert Bechtle: A Retrospective_ (2005–06), the first comprehensive exhibition of the California realist’s paintings and drawings; and _010101: Art in Technological Times_ (2001), which brought together the work of 20 international contemporary artists on the occasion of the millennium. Bishop has long been a champion of the art of the Bay Area community. As a co-curator of the SECA Art Awards from 1992 to 2006, she worked directly with dozens of Bay Area–based artists including Rosana Castrillo Díaz, Amy Franceschini, Chris Johanson, Hung Liu, Barry McGee and Josephine Taylor.

Overseeing SFMOMA’s On the Go program while the museum was closed for expansion from 2013–2016, Bishop led the museum’s innovative partnerships with multiple institutions to present more than 15 collection-based exhibitions, site-specific installations and educational initiatives in both traditional and non-traditional venues in the Bay Area and beyond. These projects allowed the museum to experiment with new ideas, engage in dialogue with a range of cultural partners and create innovative ways for new audiences to experience SFMOMA’s collection. Bishop is currently preparing a career retrospective of the artist David Park that will open at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth in June 2019, and will be presented at SFMOMA in the spring/summer of 2020.

Bishop, a Bay Area native, joined SFMOMA as a curatorial assistant in 1988, working in all the museum’s collecting departments before joining the department of Painting and Sculpture as an assistant curator in 1992. She assumed the role of Curator of Painting and Sculpture in 2000, and that position was endowed in 2015. Her interest in a museum career was sparked as an intern at the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University, and she currently serves on its Advisory Council. Bishop received her BA in art history and psychology from Cornell University and her MA in art history from Columbia University. She was named Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Ministry of Culture in 2018.

### SFMOMA’s Strategic Plan

SFMOMA’s new five-year strategic plan, developed and approved in 2018, commits the organization to a series of goals that will produce a more diverse, welcoming and relevant arts center with deep connections to the Bay Area while producing ambitious exhibitions and forward-thinking scholarship that has national and international impact.

The four goals are:

  * Assert our role in making the art of our time matter.
  * Become a human-centered, community-driven museum.
  * Transform our culture from the inside out.
  * Cultivate sustainability and growth with creativity and impact.



Each goal, developed by task forces made up of SFMOMA staff, trustees and external consultants, was broken down into objectives and tactics that are now being implemented across all departments. As those gain momentum, SFMOMA’s visitor base will grow and shift, attracting a new and more diverse population thanks to better communication with target audiences, an increased number of Free Days to allow access and stronger relationships with Bay Area cultural organizations and artists.

Works of art by women and artists of color displayed and collected by SFMOMA will increase; this initiative is already underway, with the proceeds from the _[sale of Mark Rothko’s _Untitled,_ 1960](https://www.sfmoma.org/press-release/rothko-deaccession-2019/)_ earmarked for broadening and diversifying the collection. The display of core collections, including the Fisher Collection, will be reconceptualized in ways that are more engaging and exciting, through the development of new digital interpretation, more educational, family and public programming and other audience engagement tactics. In addition, curators will pursue original scholarship that will both energize SFMOMA’s exhibition schedule and bolster its reputation as a research organization. As these strategies develop, SFMOMA will enhance its position as a thought leader among arts organizations.
