### 1935

On January 18, the San Francisco Museum of Art, under the leadership of founding director Grace McCann Morley, opens on the fourth floor of the War Memorial Veterans Building on Van Ness Avenue.

A gift of several hundred artworks from Albert M. Bender, including works by Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, establishes the nucleus of the permanent collection. In a remarkable display of generosity, Bender goes on to donate more than 1,100 objects to the museum, including photographs, and endows its first purchase fund before his death in 1941.

### 1936

The museum’s second year begins with an exhibition of works by [Henri Matisse](/artist/Henri_Matisse) — the first on the West Coast — primarily drawn from two local private collections. Many of the featured paintings and sculptures are later donated to the museum, forming the core of an exceptional collection of Fauvism.

The San Francisco Museum of Art becomes one of the first museums to recognize photography as a fine art by establishing, under the guidance of Curator John Humphrey, a collection of photographic works.

### 1940

The museum organizes its first architecture exhibition, _Telesis: Space for Living_ , a landmark effort that prompts the city of San Francisco to establish an office of planning.

### 1945

Fifty member countries convene in the War Memorial Veterans Building to establish the United Nations Charter. With its galleries commandeered for delegates and press, the museum relocates to a temporary facility on Post Street from March through July.

The museum presents Jackson Pollock’s first solo museum exhibition. Pollock’s early masterpiece [_Guardians of the Secret_](/artwork/45.1308) (1943) is added to the collection.

### 1946

The Women’s Board establishes the Rental Gallery (later known as the [Artists Gallery](https://www.sfmoma.org/artists-gallery/)). The first program of its kind in the country, it expands the collecting base in the Bay Area and creates a vibrant sales venue for local artists.

### 1951

The San Francisco Museum of Art initiates a biweekly television program entitled _Art in Your Life_ (later renamed _Discovery_). Embracing the new medium, Morley asserts, “We mean to try to make television serve for art and artists, for that seems the business of our kind of museum.” The series of half-hour shows runs for three years.

### 1952

Sixty-eight photographic works spanning the career of [Alfred Stieglitz](/artist/Alfred_Stieglitz) are acquired by purchase and through the gift of [Georgia O’Keeffe](/artist/Georgia_O%27Keeffe).
