Experience SFMOMA with an eye towards the familiar materials found in works on view. In celebration of the opening of Leah Rosenberg’s presentation _The Things We Use to Make the Things We Must_ in Koret Education Center, Rosenberg has invited a group of artists and makers to each select one work from the SFMOMA galleries and speak about the process and materials used by the artist, as well as reflect on their own practice. This program will move throughout several museum spaces and requires a general admission ticket. It will begin in Koret Education Center on Floor 2. 

### About the Artist

**Leah Rosenberg** works across artistic media to spark new experiences of color. Using painting, installation, printmaking, sculpture, performance, and video, she invites viewers to consider how color can be perceived both multi-sensorially and multi-dimensionally. By creating such enriched encounters, her work strives to deepen our understanding of the emotional and psychological impact of color in everyday life.
