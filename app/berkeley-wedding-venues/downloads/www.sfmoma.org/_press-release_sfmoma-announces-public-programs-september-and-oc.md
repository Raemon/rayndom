**LECTURES**

**Richard Tuttle: An Exposé**  
Tuesday, September 6, noon–1 p.m.  
Tara McDowell, curatorial associate, painting and sculpture, SFMOMA  
Phyllis Wattis Theater  
Tuttle’s work has generated polarized opinions, scathing reviews, and one curator’s dismissal. According to McDowell, these reactions reveal one of Tuttle’s most radical contributions to contemporary culture: a challenge to our notions of what art should be. This program examines our expectations of art and looks at how Tuttle nimbly breaks free of them.  
Free with Museum admission.

**Industrial Design Heavyweights**  
Thursday, September 15, 6:30 p.m.  
Bill Moggridge, cofounder, IDEO; special guests from IDEO  
Phyllis Wattis Theater  
Designer of the first laptop computer, Moggridge is a stalwart in the industrial design arena. He believes interdisciplinary teams are the current heavyweights of the field, their collaborative efforts driving innovation. Moggridge introduces team members from his firm IDEO and engages them in a discussion of how individual and collective work factor into their processes.  
$15 general; $10 SFMOMA and IDSA members, students, and seniors. Presented by Industrial Design Society of America, San Francisco Chapter (IDSA SF), and Architecture + Design Forum, an auxiliary of SFMOMA.

**Artist Talk: 2×4**  
Thursday, September 22, 6:30 p.m.  
Michael Rock, partner, 2×4, and professor of design, Yale University School of Art  
Phyllis Wattis Theater  
Founded in 1994 by Michael Rock, Susan Sellers, and Georgianna Stout, the design studio 2×4 has developed a reputation for innovative work that focuses on culture and spans print, motion graphics, the Web, and environmental design. Join Rock for a discussion of 2×4’s unique methodology and innovative approach to graphic design.  
Free with Museum admission.

**African American Conceptual Art and Its Legacies**  
Friday, September 30, noon–1 p.m.  
Jill Dawsey, curatorial associate, painting and sculpture, SFMOMA  
Koret Visitor Education Center  
Conceptual art, in which ideas take precedence over material forms, offered artists of the 1960s and 1970s a critical framework for exploring social issues. Alienated by the mainstream canon, African American artists such as Adrian Piper employed conceptual strategies to analyze race. Dawsey examines their legacy in the work of younger artists such as Edgar Arceneaux, for whom race is but one element in a broader constellation of conceptual concerns.  
Free with Museum admission.

**Responses to the Art of Richard Tuttle**  
Saturday, October 1, 2 p.m.  
Bill Berkson, poet and faculty member, San Francisco Art Institute; Okwui Enwezor, dean of academic affairs, San Francisco Art Institute; Pamela M. Lee, associate professor, art history, Stanford University; Lawrence Rinder, dean of graduate studies, California College of the Arts  
Phyllis Wattis Theater  
In this special afternoon program, faculty members from Bay Area institutions share their reactions to and thoughts about Richard Tuttle’s radical and innovative work.  
$14 general; $8 SFMOMA members and seniors; $4 students.

**Building a Collection: Past, Present, and Future**  
Tuesday, October 4, noon–1 p.m.  
Deborah Loft, professor of art history, College of Marin  
Phyllis Wattis Theater  
Since SFMOMA opened its doors in its current location on Third Street 10 years ago, the Museum’s permanent collection has grown significantly. The building allows for the enjoyment and preservation of the collection for many generations to come. Loft presents outstanding artworks from the collection and their histories.  
Museum and program admission are free.

**My Eyes Were Fresh: The Life and Photographs of John Gutmann**  
Thursday, October 20, 7 p.m.  
Nathaniel Dorksy, filmmaker and editor, My Eyes Were Fresh; Marvin Heiferman, curator, writer, and editor; Mark Johnson, gallery director and professor, San Francisco State University; Sandra S. Phillips, senior curator of photography, SFMOMA; Jane Reed, director and producer, My Eyes Were Fresh  
Phyllis Wattis Theater  
In 1933 Gutmann left his native Germany and set out for the United States. In 1938 he joined the faculty at San Francisco State, where he started the photography department and was an influential link to European modernist ideas for two generations of Bay Area artists and students. This program includes a screening of a new documentary celebrating Gutmann’s achievements, My Eyes Were Fresh by Jane Reed, and a panel discussion about his remarkable career. A hosted reception follows in The Schwab Room.  
$10 general; $8 SFMOMA members, students, and seniors. Includes reception.  
Copresented by Foto Forum, an auxiliary of SFMOMA.

**Artist Talk: Edgar Arceneaux**  
Thursday, October 27, 6:30 p.m.  
Edgar Arceneaux, artist  
Phyllis Wattis Theater  
Arceneaux’s work is fueled by his fascination with language and science and his interest in establishing unexpected connections between words, objects, places, and people. At once precise and offhand, his mixed-media installations link seemingly disparate subjects within a network of associations—often based on clever wordplay—that bridge ideas from different eras and cultures. Join the artist for a talk about his philosophical approach to art making. A Sessions party follows the talk.  
Free with Museum admission.

**Mending Memories: Conserving a Sculpture**  
Friday, October 28, noon–1 p.m.  
Michelle Barger, conservator of objects, SFMOMA  
Koret Visitor Education Center  
What happens when a complicated artwork made of unconventional materials is put on view? Such a work, Atrabiliarios by Colombian artist Doris Salcedo, was recently installed on the Museum’s second floor. Barger presents a case study of the work’s extensive preparation, which took two full weeks and involved a team of SFMOMA staff members as well as the artist and her assistants.  
Free with Museum admission.
