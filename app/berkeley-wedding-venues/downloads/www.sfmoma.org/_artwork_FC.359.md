NARRATOR:

This painting is called _60 Watts_. It’s part of Ed Ruscha’s silhouette series.

ED RUSCHA: 

I wanted something smoky and sort of, you know, difficult to see … I wanted there to be a little bit of a struggle there or something And I found myself using an airbrush, an air gun to make these things. 

_SFX: A film projector starts up …_

RUSCHA: 

Those silhouette shadowy paintings are filmic like. And reminded me of how movies are, with their scratches and their little blips and all that…

_SFX: the projector is running, countdown blips of a film leader…_

NARRATOR: 

How about this scene…

A house in the woods, a light in the window… it looks like someone is home.

SFX: _cheerful and comforting music. The sounds of muffled laughter, children inside the house, crackles and pops of a fireplace._

NARRATOR: 

But why is there just _one_ window lit up in that whole house?

_SFX: The music shifts to something creepy, footsteps, like someone is in the house with them. We hear the creak of a door opening._

NARRATOR: 

…and anything could be hiding in those woods…

_SFX: Super-creepy soundbed of evil lurking in the woods. We hear the howl of a wolf._

NARRATOR: 

The thing about all that shadow, there isn’t much visual information. This painting leaves a lot of space to fill in the blanks.

_SFX: sound of film projector slowly fades._
