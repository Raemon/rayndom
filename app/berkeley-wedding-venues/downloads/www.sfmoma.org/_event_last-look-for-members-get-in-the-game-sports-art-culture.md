Members get special access to _Get in the Game: Sports, Art, Culture_ before it closes! One of SFMOMA’s most ambitious exhibitions to date taps into the spirit of why we love sports through works by dozens of different artists. Enjoy one-of-a-kind interactive experiences like twenty-two-person foosball and four-sided table tennis, immerse yourself in longform videos, and admire works about and by athletes. 

In addition to the main exhibition space on Floor 7, don’t forget to visit multiple galleries related to _Get in the Game_ on Floor 2.

Members have access to this event as part of museum general admission. Not a member? Visit [sfmoma.org/membership](https://www.sfmoma.org/membership/) to join today.
