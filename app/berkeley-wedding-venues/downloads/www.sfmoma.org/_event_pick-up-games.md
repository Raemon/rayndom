### Program Schedule

#### Play With a Pro: Foosball

**Thursday, January 30, 2025  
Thursday, February 13, 2025**  
4–7 p.m.  
with Dana Marr

**Sunday, February 16, 2025**  
12–3 p.m.  
with Adrian Zamora 

While Maurizio Cattelan’s _Stadium_ (1991) is designed to be played, it may be intimidating to figure out where or how to start on a twenty-two-person foosball table. At these sessions, world champion foosball players will be on hand to offer some basics and pointers, plus play a few games. 

Dana Marr is a world champion foosball player with over forty years’ experience. A hall of fame member, he is the current coach to over thirty foosball students nationwide. 

Adrian Zamora has been a foosball champion many times over, winning national and international competitions, including the gold medal in the 2019 World Championship.
