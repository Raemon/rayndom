Team sports require not only athletic skills but the ability to apply them in a way that supports players working together. Join Bay Area Women Sports Initiative (BAWSI) and artists Michael Granville and Ashley Montulli for an afternoon that will test your personal agility and coordination before channeling them into a collaborative art-making project. Coaches from BAWSI will provide one-on-one support during a series of relays highlighting foundational skills from various sports that showcase the individualized training that hones athletic ability. Delaplane will then guide participants in small individual artworks that will be added to a larger collaborative project. This process transforms personal vision into a collective masterpiece, illustrating how a team made up of individual contributors can work together to create a unified whole.

### About the Bay Area Women Sports Initiative

Founded in 2005 by sports executive Marlene Bjornsrud and soccer stars Julie Foudy and Brandi Chastain, [BAWSI](https://bawsi.org/)‘s mission is to mobilize the women’s sports community to engage, inspire, and empower girls in under-resourced neighborhoods and children with disabilities. Their free programs level the playing field so that ALL children and youth have access to play. BAWSI has enrolled over 25,000 children in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties and has engaged over 9,500 volunteers. BAWSI programs are led by its Athlete Leadership Team, women athletes hired to serve as coaches and role models. In addition, they have strong relationships with local high schools and colleges to provide additional volunteer coaches.
