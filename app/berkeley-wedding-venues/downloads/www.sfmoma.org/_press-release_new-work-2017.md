SAN FRANCISCO, CA (February 23, 2017) — The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) will present two solo exhibitions this year through its _New Work_ series, an integral part of the museum’s commitment to debuting work by living artists. This spring, _New Work: Park McArthur_ will be Park McArthur’s first solo museum presentation. This fall, _New Work: Kerry Tribe_ will premiere an SFMOMA commission by Kerry Tribe in her first solo exhibition at a major U.S. museum.

_New Work: Park McArthur_ , the artist’s first solo museum presentation, will examine the materials and processes frequently associated with monuments, memorials and museums, and explore personal and social relationships with a building or place of congregation. The exhibition will feature new and existing work that draws from the granite and wood of SFMOMA’s building, and includes photographs of informal gathering sites such as picnic tables in a public park. The marks and signs used at these spaces question the connections — casual, recreational, ceremonial — that bind stone and wood to site, and people and locations to time. 

“McArthur works with and through the social conditions of dependency, often in relation to care and access. In this exhibition, she considers the relationships among sites of commemoration and the materials associated with them,” said Jenny Gheith, assistant curator of painting and sculpture at SFMOMA. “By exposing and subverting the frameworks of control and power in the built environment, McArthur questions a system that conflates signage with remembrance.” 

Major support for _New Work: Park McArthur_ is provided by SFMOMA’s Contemporaries. Generous support for the _New Work_ series is provided by Alka and Ravin Agrawal, Adriane Iann and Christian Stolz and Robin Wright and Ian Reeves.

### _New Work: Kerry Tribe_

##### On view October 7, 2017–February 25, 2018

_New Work: Kerry Tribe_ will premiere a new commission by the Los Angeles–based artist and filmmaker through SFMOMA’s art commissioning program, an essential part of the museum’s goal to share the art for our time with the Bay Area and beyond. Foregrounding questions of empathy, communication and performance, this solo presentation will center on a video installation offering insight into the world of Standardized Patients — professional actors trained to portray real patients in a simulated clinical environment as part of medical training. Working closely with professional clinicians, communication experts and Standardized Patients in California, Tribe’s project will build upon central themes of her artistic practice including language, consciousness and the willing suspension of disbelief. 

“Following her recent work engaging with individuals with the communication disorder aphasia, Tribe’s new project turns the focus on communication toward medical professionals and the vital role that empathy and interpersonal skills can play in patient outcomes,” said Tanya Zimbardo, assistant curator of media arts at SFMOMA. 

Generous support for the _New Work_ series is provided by Alka and Ravin Agrawal, Adriane Iann and Christian Stolz and Robin Wright and Ian Reeves. 

Major support for Commissioned Art at SFMOMA is provided by Roberta and Steve Denning. Generous support is provided by illy coffee and Diana Nelson and John Atwater. 

### About Kerry Tribe

Kerry Tribe was born in 1973 in Boston, Massachusetts. She was a fellow at the American Academy in Berlin, received her MFA from UCLA and BA from Brown University and attended the Independent Study Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Tribe has been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane; The Power Plant, Toronto; and Camden Arts Centre, London, among other venues. Her work has been included in numerous group exhibitions, film festivals and performance series at such institutions as the Hammer Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, among others. 

### About _New Work_

Since 1987, SFMOMA’s _New Work_ series has provided a platform for experimentation: a space for artists to develop or premiere a body of work or present existing work in a new context. Through _New Work_ , SFMOMA has organized early exhibitions with artists such as Matthew Barney, Marilyn Minter, Kara Walker and Christopher Wool, all of whom received their first solo museum shows through the series. The inaugural _New Work_ exhibition in the newly expanded SFMOMA — presented in a gallery dedicated to the series — featured Portuguese artist Leonor Antunes, followed by an exhibition of work by Japanese photographer Sohei Nishino. Each _New Work_ exhibition is accompanied by an illustrated brochure.
