The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) is proud to present Target Family Day on Sunday, June 1, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. This daylong celebration is an opportunity for families to have fun while creating, viewing, and learning about art. Everyone is admitted free to SFMOMA on Target Family Day. Families may partake in any or all of the day’s activities, including performances, film screenings, gallery treasure hunts, and hands-on art projects.

The Target Family Day on June 1, titled _A Sense of Place_ , will look at the work of Italian photographer Gabriele Basilico and artists in the SFMOMA collection, such as Yves Tanguy and Henri Matisse. Through hands-on activities, families will discover how these artists interpret the world around us and develop a sense of place through their artwork. From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., families will have an opportunity to make art together guided by artist teachers in the Koret Visitor Education Center. Activities will include the community installation of a three-dimensional garden mural, directed by artists Jennifer Ewing and Leo Germano. In addition, two screenings of the documentary film _Winged Migration_ will be presented at 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. in the Phyllis Wattis Theater. The film follows migrating flocks of birds around the world as they glide over familiar landmarks. Readings of the 1962 classic _This is San Francisco_ , by Miroslav Sasek, will take place in the Learning Lounge at 11 a.m., 12:30 p.m., and 1 p.m. There will be a musical performance by Supercussion in The Schwab Room at 2 p.m.

Family Days at SFMOMA began in 1995. According to Neal Benezra, director of SFMOMA, “Target has enabled families to begin a tradition of museum-going by providing not only our June 1 Target Family Day but also by sponsoring future Target Family Days on October 19 and February 1.”

Laysha Ward, Target’s vice president of community relations, adds, “Target believes that art brings communities together by creating experiences that cross cultures, inspiring ideas for the future, and enriching life today. We are proud to join with SFMOMA for Target Family Day as a way to make the arts accessible to youth and families in the Bay Area.”

Minneapolis-based Target gives more than $3 million each week to its local communities’ arts, education, and health organizations. Target employees donate more than 350,000 hours of time to more than 7,500 community-based projects. Family programs are held the first and third Sunday of every month at SFMOMA.
