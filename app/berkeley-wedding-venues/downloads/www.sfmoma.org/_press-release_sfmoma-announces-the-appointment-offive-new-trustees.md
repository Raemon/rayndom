SAN FRANCISCO, CA (April 5, 2022)—The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) announces the recent appointment of five new members to its Board of Trustees. David Huffman and Tucker Nichols were elected to the museum’s board at its September 2021 meeting; Bill Fisher was elected at its December 2021 meeting; and Katie Rodan and Carrie Mae Weems were elected at its March 2022 meeting. Huffman, Nichols and Weems will serve as the museum’s newest Artist Trustees. Serving critical roles on SFMOMA’s board, Artist Trustees represent the artist community and provide essential counsel to the museum and its leadership. 

The esteemed group of new trustees brings a wide breadth of skills and experience to the board and a deep dedication to the arts, education and community engagement. A complete list of SFMOMA’s Board of Trustees can be found at [sfmoma.org](https://www.sfmoma.org/).

### ABOUT THE TRUSTEES

**David Huffman**

Native Bay Area artist David Huffman was raised in Berkeley and Oakland with a family active in the Civil Rights Movement, including his mother who was an artist for the Black Panther Party. His paintings—which he calls “Social Abstraction” are an amalgamation of the history of abstract painting, Black culture and science fiction. 

SFMOMA holds two works by Huffman in its collection. _The Black Hole and a Traumanaut’s Uncertain Journey_ (2008) was acquired in 2014 as purchase through the Accessions Committee Fund and was featured in SFMOMA’s On the Go partnership with the Museum of the African Diaspora in 2015. In 2019, SFMOMA commissioned Huffman to create a major work, _Rise_ , for the Chase Center, now permanently on view in its east lobby. For this piece, Huffman used a previous work, _Double Jump_ (2014), as inspiration. In 2020, the museum acquired this source painting through a gift of Pat Wilson. 

Huffman holds both a BA and MFA from the California College of the Arts. He has exhibited widely locally and nationally, is included in many public collections, and is represented by Miles McEnery Gallery in New York.

  
**Tucker Nichols**

Marin County-based artist Tucker Nichols is best known for drawings and paintings featuring colorful, whimsical flowers. In addition to his two-dimensional works, he also creates sculptures, books and performance-based projects. 

SFMOMA has an extensive history of working with Nichols. The Media Arts department first commissioned him for the exhibition _Stage Presence_ in 2012, and he was subsequently commissioned to create a project for the restaurant In Situ at SFMOMA in 2016. Nichols was one of the seven artists featured as part of the 2021 exhibition _Close to Home: Creativity in Crisis_ responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, Nichols also collaborated with SFMOMA on a segment for Night of Ideas — an event presented in partnership with the San Francisco Public Library — which included 1,600 free silkscreen prints distributed to anyone with a library card. 

Nichols holds a BA in the History of Art from Brown University and an MFA in East Asian Studies from Yale University. He has exhibited widely locally and nationally and is included in many public collections as well as at the Benioff Children’s Hospital. He is represented by Gallery 16, San Francisco, and ZieherSmith, New York.

  
**Bill Fisher**

Bill Fisher is the Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Manzanita Capital Ltd., a London-based private equity firm founded in 2001. Currently he serves on the Board of Diptyque, Byredo and Space NK. Prior to this position, he spent 15 years at Gap Inc. where he founded and built Gap’s International Division.

Fisher sits on the corporate boards of Gap and Winmore. He is Trustee Emeritus at the Exploratorium and also serves on the UCSF Board of Overseers. He is a member of the Princeton Art Museum Advisory Council and serves on the Executive Committee with the Centre Pompidou. Fisher and his wife Sako are longtime art collectors and advocates. Together, they have been dedicated supporters of SFMOMA over the past decade.

  
**Katie Rodan**

Katie Rodan, MD, is the co-developer of the skincare management system Proactiv, launched in 1995, and the beauty and skincare company Rodan + Fields, founded in 2002. She is an adjunct clinical assistant professor of dermatology at Stanford University School of Medicine, and has a private practice in medical, surgical and cosmetic dermatology in Oakland.

Steadfast supporters of SFMOMA, Rodan and her husband Amnon have served on several committees and auxiliaries for the museum and are longtime collectors and enthusiasts of modern and contemporary art. 

Rodan earned her BA in History from the University of Virginia and her MD from the University of Southern California School of Medicine. She completed her residency in dermatology at Stanford University School of Medicine.

  
**Carrie Mae Weems**

Carrie Mae Weems has a long history with the Bay Area and SFMOMA. SFMOMA hosted her 1993 solo exhibition organized by the National Museum of Women in the Arts, and she has nine works and four promised gifts in the museum’s collection, the first of which was acquired in 1992. 

Weems employs photographs, text, fabric, audio, digital images, installation and video in her impactful artistic practice, which frequently explores family relationships, race, class, gender, political systems and structures of power. 

Weems received a BA from Cal Arts and an MFA from UC San Diego, where she met classmate and former SFMOMA Artist Trustee, the late and beloved Hung Liu, with whom she became lifelong friends. 

In 2013, Weems was named a MacArthur Fellow and received the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s Lifetime Achievement Award. She has received several additional awards, grants, and fellowships, including the Prix de Roma and The National Endowment for the Arts Award, among others. Weems was presented with one of the first U.S. Department of State’s Medals of Arts in recognition of her commitment to the State Department’s Art in Embassies program. She is currently Artist in Residence at Syracuse University and is represented by Jack Shainman Gallery in New York and Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco.
