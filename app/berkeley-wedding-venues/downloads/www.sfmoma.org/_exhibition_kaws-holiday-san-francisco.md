The thirty-six-foot-tall (11m) inflatable sculpture on SFMOMA’s rooftop is the fourteenth iteration of KAWS’s _HOLIDAY_ project. Launched in 2018, _HOLIDAY_ brings the artist’s popular characters at monumental scale to some of the World’s most iconic sites, from the foot of Mount Fuji, to ancient temples in Indonesia, to the skies of Melbourne.

As a young artist, KAWS (Brian Donnelly, born 1974, Jersey City, NJ) established himself as a graffiti writer, tagging the urban landscape. With _HOLIDAY_ , the artist again imagines the city as his canvas. Here, his COMPANION character sits atop the terraced rooftop of SFMOMA’s Mario Botta–designed building. Is he resting, enjoying the skyline, or just hanging out?

_HOLIDAY: SAN FRANCISCO_ is presented as part of _KAWS: FAMILY_ , the artist’s first major West Coast museum exhibition, on view at SFMOMA from November 15, 2025, through May 3, 2026. [Get your tickets today](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/kaws-family/).
