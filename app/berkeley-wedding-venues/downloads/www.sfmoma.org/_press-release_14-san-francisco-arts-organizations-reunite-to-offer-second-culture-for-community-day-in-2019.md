San Francisco, CA (August 13, 2019) _Culture for Community_ — a unique partnership of 14 arts and cultural organizations in the Yerba Buena neighborhood — presents the second **Culture for Community Free Day on September 19, 2019.**

Designed to highlight issues of importance to the community, the _Culture for Community_ collaboration showcases the Yerba Buena arts district as one of the city’s premiere destinations, and increases accessibility to the neighborhood’s rich cultural offerings. Each Free Day focuses on a theme that resonates with the unique perspectives of the Bay Area community. The second Free Day of 2019 (the first was March 21) focuses on the importance of intergenerational connections and storytelling _— Culture for Generations_. It offers a full day of museum and gallery hopping in the Yerba Buena neighborhood, with each _Culture for Community_ partner hosting special events and activities throughout the day.

A sampling of programs offered during _Culture for Community_ on September 19 includes:

  * **MoAD’s** open mic night celebrating the importance of intergenerational knowledge and storytelling will feature spoken word, playback theater and poets that span generations.
  * **The Yerba Buena Gardens Festival** will feature an outdoor salsa party at Jessie Square with Ricardo Lemvo who has honed an irresistibly grooving Afro-salsa sound, blending Congolese rumba and soukous with Cuban charanga and son.
  * **The Yerba Buena Center for the Arts** will offer an evening of _Artist to Artist_ conversations on themes of intergenerationality, and complimentary admission to the West Coast premiere of _The Body Electric_.
  * **Crown Point Press** will feature a presentation of new etchings by San Francisco sculptor, Gay Outlaw, accompanied by a companion exhibition featuring gallery artists from Crown Point’s long history.
  * **SFMOMA** will offer _Don’t! Photography and Art of Mistakes,_ an exhibition featuring generations of photographers who confronted the rules and constraints of photography. (Major support for SFMOMA Free Community Days are provided by Martha and Bruce Atwater and Concepcion S. and Irwin Federman. Generous support is provided by the Hao Family.)
  * **The Contemporary Jewish Museum’s** _Night at the Jewseum_ will showcase Bay Area-born artist Daria Martin’s intergenerational dreamscape, _Tonight the World_.
