**Enjoy special member viewing hours on closing weekend!** Developed in close collaboration with the artist, _Suzanne Jackson: What Is Love_ celebrates Jackson’s groundbreaking artistic vision through more than 80 lyrical paintings and drawings from the 1960s to the present, exploring her use of color, light, and structure to expand the parameters of painting and illuminate the persistence of peace, love, and beauty. Experience compositions on canvas with imagery from the artist’s dreams, as well as recent innovative three-dimensional paintings, which suspend acrylic paint in mid-air, and a new large-scale commission.
