### Mixtape: _The Beholder’s Share_

_Raw Material_ is back in the mixtape game with a collection of episodes by some of our favorite podcasts at the moment. Presented by Tamar Avishai of the Lonely Palette podcast, this mixtape explores not just how art contributes to our lives but also how we, as viewers or as listeners, contribute to art.

### Season 6: _Six Degrees_

Is it really possible to reach anyone in the world through only six degrees of separation? In season six of _Raw Material_ , audio producer Sayre Quevedo sets out to reach a stranger eight thousand miles away through a series of artists and friends, all of whom share their stories of love, trauma, distance, and togetherness along the way. Travel with Sayre as he uncovers some of the surprising ways people are connected across time, memory, and space. In “Six Degrees,” no connection is too trivial, no distance too far.

### Season 5: _San Francisco—Stories from the Model City_

From memories of the luminous Golden Gate International Exposition on Treasure Island to recollections of the freaky fun house at Playland, from North Beach to the Mission, _Stories from the Model City_ brings to life the fascinating and troubled evolution of San Francisco.

### Season 4: _Luvvers_

Art and sex: name a more iconic duo. Hosted by the artist and curator Chelsea Beck, this season of _Raw Material_ considers the ways artists use sex as a tool for self-exploration and creative sustenance.
