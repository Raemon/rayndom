# About the Archives

The purpose of the Archives is to collect, preserve, and share museum records, artifacts, and memorabilia. In this way, the history of SFMOMA — its place within the art canon — along with its collections and exhibitions, are cared for and available to future generations. We hold records from the Office of the Director(s), exhibition documentation and photographs, publications, sound and video recordings of events, and more.

Access to the Archives is by appointment only. Visitors must [request an appointment](https://www.sfmoma.org/library-archives/about-archives/archives-policies-procedures/archives-appointment-request/) at least five weeks in advance of their intended visit.

The SFMOMA Library collection includes books, serials, ephemera, and other print materials documenting modern and contemporary art. [Learn more about the SFMOMA Library](https://www.sfmoma.org/library-archives/about-library/)
