SAN FRANCISCO—The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) announces an innovative partnership with Michelin-three-starred Chef Corey Lee to create _In Situ_ , a new restaurant on the ground floor level of the museum that will debut in spring 2016.

Chef Lee will engage the global food community and reimagine the traditional restaurant experience by curating and executing a menu of dishes from recipes contributed by over 80 chefs from around the world. Participants include René Redzepi (_Noma_), Alice Waters (C _hez Panisse_), Thomas Keller (_The French Laundry_), Hajime Yoneda (_HAJIME_), Virgilio Martínez (_Central_), Martin Picard (_Au Pied de Cochon_), Olivier Roellinger (_Les Maisons de Bricourt_), Andoni Luis Aduriz (_Mugaritz_) and Dominique Ansel (_Dominique Ansel Kitchen_).

“Similar to how we identify and support original creative voices and celebrate great masters, Corey is looking to the innovators, the emerging chefs and the legends to create the menu for _In Situ_ ,” describes Neal Benezra, director of SFMOMA. “Corey will partner with the chefs who are pushing the boundaries of the culinary world and bring global collaboration, excitement and flavors to our restaurant. What a terrific coup for SFMOMA.”

_In Situ_ will feature a rotating a la carte menu that will change to balance seasonality, style and geography. Lee will work closely with each chef to faithfully represent the dish both in technique and spirit. While some chefs have chosen to share a dish from their existing repertoire, others are creating something specifically for _In Situ_. 

“I see this project as an extension of the museum’s larger mission—to present great works worldwide and make them accessible for greater public engagement,” says Lee. “ _In Situ_ will build appreciation for culinary traditions and hopefully encourage dialogue about our relationships to food, not unlike the way SFMOMA collects and cares for important works of art.”

_In Situ_ will be located adjacent to the museum’s Third Street entrance and will nearly double the square footage of the previous restaurant. Designed by Aidlin Darling Design of San Francisco (_Bar Agricole_ , the _Windhover Contemplative Center_ at Stanford University and _Scribe Vineyards)_ , this project represents a unique intersection of art, design, food and community. The design of the restaurant emphasizes visibility from the street and accessibility to visitors, within a simple, comfortable, open environment. Spaces are designed to engage all of the senses with an emphasis on acoustics and tactility. The interior shell of the building will be partially exposed and is inhabited by carefully considered “artifacts” in the form of lighting, art, furniture and a wood ceiling canopy, all with the intent of drawing contrast between the rough and the refined.

_In Situ_ will remain open beyond the museum’s hours, serving both lunch and dinner. With a total capacity of 150, the restaurant will be divided into two areas—a smaller section with tables available for reservations and a larger, open space that encourages walk-ins, activity, and use of the restaurant as public space.

**Additional Dining Options at the New SFMOMA – _Cafe 5_ and _Sightglass at SFMOMA_**

SFMOMA will present two other options to pair food with art when the museum opens in spring 2016. On the fifth floor, _Cafe 5_ will offer a menu of lighter fare with a California-fusion mindset. Included will be flatbreads, fresh organic salads and artisan open-faced sandwiches. Guests will be able to dine in the rooftop sculpture garden and be served tableside. The cafe will be operated by McCalls, who also operate cafes in the de Young, Legion of Honor and Asian Art museums in San Francisco.

On the third floor, _Sightglass at SFMOMA_ will provide handcrafted coffee beverages, espresso drinks and an assortment of pastries from outstanding San Francisco bakeries and pastry chefs. Located directly adjacent to the museum’s new Photography Interpretive Gallery, visitors will be allowed to bring their coffees into this interpretive gallery as they reflect on and connect with photography. Founded in 2009, Sightglass currently operates two coffee bars and roasteries in the Mission and SoMa neighborhoods of San Francisco, and a coffee booth on Tuesdays and Saturdays at the San Francisco Farmers Market at the historic Ferry Building.

His career has spanned nearly 20 years of working at some of the most acclaimed restaurants in the world, including a tenure as head chef at _The French Laundry_.
