# School Partnerships + Projects

We’re bringing resources, artists, and art professionals to high school students, and bringing students’ creativity and insights to SFMOMA. As part of our mission to support and engage with students and teachers, SFMOMA is partnering directly with selected San Francisco Unified School District high schools. These partnerships were created to deepen students’ understanding of modern and contemporary art and introduce them to careers in the arts.

We’re supporting each selected high school in a specific way. Our partnership with Balboa High School focuses on curating and integrating contemporary art into humanities learning. We’re working with Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts to create the school’s first department of architecture and design.

In addition, SFMOMA commissions artist projects with non-partner Bay Area high schools. These unique collaborations expose students to artistic practice and explore why art matters in the world today.

Past projects:

  * Downtown High School’s Acting for Critical Thought students printed their own poster with Sanctuary Print artists Sergio De La Torre and Chris Treggiari and rewrote, reconstructed, and reassembled a refugee’s narrative as part of the Spring 2018 semester’s theme, Refugees of War: Writing and Art as Resistance
  * Downtown High School’s Farming Organically to Revolutionize Kitchens students collaborated with artist Eliza Gregory, D’Maize restaurant, and Mission Chinese Food to talk about food, entrepreneurship, and belonging in a fast-changing city
  * Abraham Lincoln High School and Janet Delaney: exploration of Delaney’s _South of Market_ photography exhibition at the de Young Museum
  * Phillip and Sala Burton High School students worked with Lucky Dragons, a collaborative duo comprising artists Sarah Rara and Luke Fischbeck, to create “event scores” (a technique used historically by artists to make work in the form of instructions) to strategize and communicate about forms of protest
  * San Francisco International High School and Eduardo Pineda: creation of an internationally themed mural on the school’s exterior
  * Oakland School for the Arts and 2012 SECA Art Award winner Zarouhie Abdalian: collaboration on Abdalian’s sound installation _Occasional Music_ in the nearby downtown area
  * Galileo Academy of Science and Technology and Ben Kinmont: a multiples project that incorporated student work into Kinmont’s archive and his project _[On becoming something else](/read/artist-ben-kinmonts-open-studio-becoming-something-else/)_
