SAN FRANCISCO, CA (February 22, 2023; updated March 13, 2023)—The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) invites all art lovers to [**Art Bash**](https://www.sfmoma.org/event/series/art-bash/), a spectacular party across the museum, celebrating trailblazing art and artists. This year’s Art Bash on April 19, 2023, honors the artist **Marilyn Minter** and features incredible artist-designed installations by Minter, **Woody De Othello** and **Sadie Barnette**. Partygoers also will experience a one-of-a-kind lineup of live performances and an array of food and beverage experiences.

SFMOMA’s not-to-be-missed event is spearheaded by Art Bash 2023 Host Committee members **Kumasi Aaron, Azzurra Alliata, Sabrina Buell, Katie Colendich, Wes Mitchell, Brittany Pattner, Alexis Pence, Grace Salk** and **Neal Sarin**. Art Bash funds SFMOMA’s much-loved education and family programs and community engagement events that benefit over 150,000 people every year, such as the popular First Thursdays, offering free admission for all Bay Area residents.

_ART EXPERIENCES AND PERFORMANCES_

The 2023 Art Bash rolls out in multiple phases of celebration throughout the evening, beginning with the immersive dinner experience (6 p.m.), followed by the pre-party (7 p.m.), party (8 p.m.) and late-night party (10 p.m.). Dinner guests will hear from acclaimed artist **Marilyn Minter**. Marilyn Minter will also provide provocative and lushly textured art featured on wallpaper and projected on screens during the dinner. Minter’s thrilling and hyperrealist paintings and photographs explore the female body, glamour and notions of beauty from a feminist perspective.

Throughout the night, SFMOMA will burst to life with engaging encounters and surprising art experiences, including a performance by pop-R&B singer **Amber Mark** , a DJ set by **Toro y Moi** and immersive art installations by Bay Area artists **Woody De Othello** and**Sadie Barnette.** **Duserock** and **DJ Umami** will keep the music flowing and invite guests to dance late into the night.

For the Art Bash pre-party, starting at 7 p.m., Oakland-based artist **Woody De Othello** will create a surreal and experiential jazz lounge across four galleries, including multiple bars and a performance art piece. A vinyl reproduction of a painting by Othello will serve as a feature wall welcoming guests as they enter the galleries.

Art Bash also marks the unveiling of Oakland-based artist Sadie Barnette’s _**The** **New Eagle Creek Saloon** _at SFMOMA _,_ an installation that reimagines her father’s bar—the first Black-owned gay bar in San Francisco._The New Eagle Creek Saloon_ will feature a local DJ and performers from the Bay Area’s Black queer community as well as custom-designed coasters and a craft cocktail menu. While the original bar closed in 1993, Barnette’s installation acts as a site of celebration and resistance, embodying the slogan, “A friendly place, with a funky bass, for every race.” Public programs in Sadie Barnette’s _The New Eagle Creek Saloon_ at SFMOMA will continue through May 11. More information may be found below or visit [sfmoma.org](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/sadie-barnette-the-new-eagle-creek-saloon).

To generate more excitement leading up to Art Bash, SFMOMA has commissioned local artists **Rewina Beshue** , **Jeffrey Cheung** and **Simón Malvaez** to design eye-catching event posters that will be wheat-pasted around San Francisco. In addition, each of the artists will create a large-scale photo backdrop in their own style for the big event.
