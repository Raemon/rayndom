#### About MAKE! with SCRAP

At these drop-in workshops designed and led by educators from [SCRAP](https://www.scrap-sf.org/), ordinary materials transform into extraordinary make-and-take art projects. The workshops make use of supplies from SCRAP’s creative reuse center and are inspired by SFMOMA exhibitions including [_Alejandro Cartagena: Ground Rules,_](www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/alejandro-cartagena-ground-rules/) [_Suzanne Jackson: What Is Love,_](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/suzanne-jackson-what-is-love/) and [_KAWS: FAMILY_](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/kaws-family/).

Founded in 1976 by Anne Marie Theilen and based in San Francisco’s Bayview neighborhood, [SCRAP](https://www.scrap-sf.org/) works at the intersection of the arts, arts education, and the environment. SCRAP’s mission is to make the materials and methods of art making accessible to everyone, helping people transform everyday objects into creative projects that fuel the human spirit, support community vibrancy, and reinforce environmental awareness. At the time of its founding, Theilen oversaw a program that placed professional artists in schools. Unfortunately, there was no budget for materials, so the artists struggled to find supplies. Meanwhile, many local businesses were filling landfills with perfectly usable materials like paper with incorrect logos, fabric samples, industrial discards, and product overruns. Recognizing an opportunity to solve two problems with one solution, Theilen founded SCRAP in 1976. She teamed up with Ruth Asawa, who became the organization’s first board president. Each year, SCRAP’s programs serve over 33,000 people — all while diverting over 200 tons of waste from landfills.
