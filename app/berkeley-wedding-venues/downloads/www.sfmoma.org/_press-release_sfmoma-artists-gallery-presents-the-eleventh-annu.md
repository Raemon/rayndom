The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) Artists Gallery will hold its annual Artists Warehouse Sale from Wednesday, May 5 through Sunday, May 9, 2004, at San Francisco’s Fort Mason Center, Building A. This benefit sale is one of the Bay Area’s most anticipated annual art events and includes a variety of works—paintings, sculptures, photographs, and prints—created by more than four hundred invited West Coast artists such as Ray Beldner, Willard Dixon, Judith Foosaner, Michael Osborne, Gustavo Rivera, and M. Louise Stanley. All artworks are 50 percent off normal retail price, making for some extraordinary bargains. Sale proceeds benefit the programs of the SFMOMA Artists Gallery, which supports both the Museum and regional artists. This event is free and open to the public.

“This year’s sale inventory is perhaps the most remarkable we’ve seen,” says Artists Gallery Director Marian Parmenter. “Collectors will find a vast selection of desirable pieces from some of the region’s most prestigious artists, ranging stylistically from traditional still lifes to new-genre pieces done in experimental media.”

The sale begins with a grand opening reception on Wednesday, May 5, from 6 to 9 p.m., featuring complimentary wine and live music by the all-female Cajun band the Cajun Belles. The final day of the sale closes with live jazz in the afternoon by the Roger Tuan Ensemble. During the week of the sale, the gallery will offer special extended hours:

**Wednesday, May 5—6–9 p.m. (opening and reception)  
Thursday, May 6—noon–8 p.m.  
  
Friday, May 7—noon–8 p.m.  
  
Saturday, May 8—noon–5:30 p.m.  
Sunday, May 9—noon–4 p.m.**

Although the gallery restocks sale works daily, visitors are encouraged to attend early for the best selection.

Established in 1978, the SFMOMA Artists Gallery now represents more than thirteen hundred emerging and established West Coast artists and mounts eleven exhibitions each year, including solo exhibitions, group and theme shows, and occasional career retrospectives of mature artists. The gallery offers exposure and support to regional artists while providing seasoned collectors, corporate clients, and art-world newcomers alike an affordable way to enjoy original artwork.
