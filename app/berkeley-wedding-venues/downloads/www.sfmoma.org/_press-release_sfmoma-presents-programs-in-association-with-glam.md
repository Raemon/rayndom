The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) will present a series of public programs in conjunction with the exhibition _Glamour: Fashion, Industrial Design, Architecture_. The exhibition will be on view from October 9, 2004, through January 17, 2005.

As one of the most alluring yet elusive concepts in contemporary style, glamour is an ideal that permeates our visual culture. This exhibition radically revises our understanding of glamour in the fields of fashion, industrial design, and architecture. Tracing glamour’s trajectory from Hollywood’s golden age to its present–day connotations of affluence, _Glamour: Fashion, Industrial Design, Architecture_ presents a striking array of more than 100 objects including couture, jewelry, automobiles, furniture, and built and unbuilt architecture—all of which share an affinity for richly decorative patterning, complex layering, and sumptuous materials.

**Opening Day Panel Discussion**  
_Fabricating Affluence_  
Saturday, October 9 – 2 p.m.  
Phyllis Wattis Theater

Phil Patton, author, journalist, and contributing editor, _ID_ magazine  
Virginia Postrel, author, _The Substance of Style_  
Joseph Rosa, Helen Hilton Raiser Curator of Architecture and Design, SFMOMA  
Valerie Steele, director, The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology

_Glamour_ catalogue contributors Patton, Postrel, Rosa, and Steele examine the concept of glamour in three disciplines—fashion, industrial design, and architecture—from its historical origins to its present-day connotations of affluence and elegance. The program concludes with a roundtable discussion moderated by Rosa followed by a question–and–answer period with the audience.

$12 general; $8 SFMOMA members, students with ID, and seniors.

**Glamour: Fashion, Industrial Design, Architecture  
  
Lectures**

**Fashion: Zac Posen**  
Friday, October 22 – 3 p.m.  
Phyllis Wattis Theater  
After only three seasons, New York designer Zac Posen has established a completely new aesthetic that is both elegant and eccentric. In this program Posen talks about his technique: using unconventional materials and tailoring to transform the classic elements of glamour.

**Industrial Design: Ross Lovegrove**  
Saturday, November 20 – 2 p.m.  
Phyllis Wattis Theater  
Known for designs that marry beauty and logic, London-based Ross Lovegrove favors an organic, highly sculptural aesthetic. The Welsh designer, who describes himself as a futurist and humanist, discusses his “supernatural” approach to design—natural forms rendered in innovative, high-tech materials.

A book signing in the Haas Atrium follows the lecture.

**Architecture: Hernan Diaz Alonso**  
Thursday, January 13, 2005 – 7 p.m.  
Phyllis Wattis Theater  
Noted for designs that are sometimes animalistic and often darkly baroque, Hernán Díaz Alonso has infused his practice with the narrative and aesthetic strategies of contemporary art. The Argentina-born, Los Angeles–based architect articulates his vision of architecture as metaphor.

Tickets per lecture: $15 general; $12 students with ID and seniors; $8 SFMOMA members. Includes admission to _Glamour_ and _Roy Lichtenstein: All About Art_. Available at the Museum with no surcharge or through www.sfmoma.org/tickets. For more information, call 415.357.4000.

_Glamour: Fashion, Industrial Design, Architecture_ is organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Support for this exhibition has been generously provided by Elaine McKeon, the Estates of Emily and Lewis S. Callaghan, Carolyn and Preston Butcher, and an anonymous donor, with additional funding from AT&T.

Public programs in conjunction with this exhibition have been generously supported by the Architecture + Design Forum, an auxiliary of SFMOMA.
