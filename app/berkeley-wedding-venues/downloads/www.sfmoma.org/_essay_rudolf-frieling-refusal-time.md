A world turned loose awaits us upon entering a darkened space. Projected mechanical devices— bellows, a zoetrope, a Duchampian bicycle wheel, a row of metronomes—contract, rotate, or swing, marking time at different speeds. Time is concrete and discrete: there is Greenwich Mean Time, and there is African time. Images, in or out of sync, explode on screens all around us. Chairs placed here and there offer vantage points for viewing particular projections, or for hearing the audio feeds that play through steel megaphones, but nowhere within the installation is a viewer able to take it in in its entirety. A world revolving, spinning, breaking apart, but always profoundly alive.

William Kentridge’s art has always reworked artistic practices—drawing, filming, sculpting, performing, speaking, acting, directing. Here these multifaceted studio activities are realized in a truly collaborative manner. _The Refusal of_ _Time_ grew out of conversations with Harvard physicist and science historian Peter Galison and came into being with the collaboration of editor Catherine Meyburgh and composer Philip Miller, and a production team including Jonas Lundquist and set designer Sabine Theunissen. As in his complex theatrical and operatic collaborations, Kentridge casts a wide net of historical and contemporary allusions. Everything is connected, but only an artist’s mind is likely to conjure Charles Dickens’s _Hard Times_(1854) and Albert Einstein’s theory of special relativity (1905), the Marx Brothers’ movie _Duck Soup_ (1933), the French anarchist who tried to blow up the Greenwich Observatory in 1894, and the twentieth-century South African resistance against the imperialist regime of time, all in the spirit of African dance.

As if this maze of cross-references and exploding trajectories on the walls needed something tangible as an anchor in its center, a kinetic sculpture, the “breathing machine” that Kentridge also calls the “elephant,” grounds the visitor in a steady rhythm, a relentless force recalling the industrial age in the presence of something other: African time, embodied. Some will take respite in this heartbeat of the work; others will relish the unchained sounds and visions around them and may rediscover long-forgotten anarchic impulses. Either way, it’s time for us to reboot and find our own time again.

At the museum, he recently co-curated the collection presentation _What Matters_ (2023-2024), retrospectives _Nam June Paik_ (2021) and _Suzanne Lacy: We Are Here_ (2019) _Soundtracks_ (2017–18) and _Bruce Conner: It's All True_ (2016) and organized _Film as Place_ (2016), _Christian Marclay: The Clock_ (2013), _Lynn Hershman Leeson: The Agent Ruby Files_ (2013), _Stage Presence: Theatricality in Art and Media_ (2012), _Descriptive Acts_ (2012), _Sharon Lockhart: Lunch Break_ (2011), _David Claerbout: Architecture of Narrative_ (2011), _Long Play: Bruce Conner and the Singles Collection_ (2010), and the influential survey exhibition _The Art of Participation: 1950 to Now_ (2008). He also collaborated on the SFMOMA presentation of the traveling exhibition _Exposed: Voyeurism, Surveillance and the Camera_ (2010) and oversaw the exhibition _William Kentridge: Five Themes_ (2009). Spearheading the notion of the museum as a producer, Frieling has commissioned two works for SFMOMA’s public spaces: Jim Campbell’s _Exploded Views_(2011–12) and Bill Fontana’s _Sonic Shadows_ (2010). Frieling has also served as senior adjunct professor at California College of the Arts, the San Francisco Art Institute, and has lectured on media history and theory at institutions nationally and internationally. He studied English literature, social sciences, and philosophy at _Freie Universität_ Berlin and received a PhD from Universität Hildesheim.
