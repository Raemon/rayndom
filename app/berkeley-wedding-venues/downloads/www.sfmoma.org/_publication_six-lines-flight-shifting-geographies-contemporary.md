Contemporary art is no longer defined by the activity of a few traditional centers — such as New York, London, or Paris — but is instead shaped by a constellation of diverse communities, small and large. Published in conjunction with an exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, this groundbreaking book explores the hybrid and shifting nature of today’s international cultural landscape by introducing readers to the artist-initiated organizations and collectives that support the art scenes in six far-flung cities: Beirut, Lebanon; Cali, Colombia; Cluj-Napoca, Romania; Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; San Francisco, United States; and Tangier, Morocco. In presenting the artistic and organizational work of artists whose efforts have shaped these rising cultural centers, _Six Lines of Flight_ explores the pathways between them, illuminating the global, interconnected spirit of twenty-first-century art.

Essays by curators and writers active in each region are accompanied by color images of representative artworks and brief texts on the artists in the exhibition, including Yto Barrada, Tiffany Chung, Wilson Díaz, Futurefarmers, Adrian Ghenie, Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige, Helena Producciones, Lamia Joreige, Dinh Q. Lê, Victor Man, Carlos Mayolo and Luis Ospina, Oscar Muñoz, Ciprian Mureșan, The Propeller Group, Graziella and Jalal Toufic, and Akram Zaatari. These introductory texts are complemented by thematic essays by Tarek Elhaik and Dominic Willsdon, Hou Hanru, and Pamela M. Lee that further contextualize cultural production in the featured cities by addressing such issues as the construction of contested histories, center-periphery dynamics, and the effects of economic and cultural renaissance.

Published in association with University of California Press on the occasion of the exhibition _Six Lines of Flight: Shifting Geographies in Contemporary Art,_**** held at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (September 15–December 31, 2012)
