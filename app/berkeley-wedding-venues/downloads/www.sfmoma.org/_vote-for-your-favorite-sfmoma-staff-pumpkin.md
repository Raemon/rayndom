# Which Pumpkin Reigns Supreme? Vote in SFMOMA’s Annual Pumpkin Contest 

At SFMOMA, we like to get in the Halloween spirit by hosting an annual pumpkin decorating contest. Ask anyone and they’ll tell you the competition can get pretty ripe, thanks in large part to the creative energy and quick wit of our colleagues.

This year, we invited our broader SFMOMA community to participate in our festive shenanigans. After 20 pumpkins, four days of voting, and a nail-bitingly close race, SFMOMA has crowned the winners of this year’s competition.

Take a look at the picks of the patch below, and Happy Halloween from SFMOMA!

**Scare Crowds**  
"She's a modern day scarecrow, sans a mask, to keep the crowds away from my house and frighten the children who no longer remember what the bottom of people's faces look like. Homemade papier-mâché pumpkin on the chicest homemade scare crow in the Mission."

The rest is history."

"My sister picked out this pumpkin at the patch and – let's be honest – got some side eye for her selection. Because she loves this pumpkin so much and because I too believe that it is uniquely beautiful, I felt this pumpkin deserved a submission for its untouched (and un-retouched) beauty."
