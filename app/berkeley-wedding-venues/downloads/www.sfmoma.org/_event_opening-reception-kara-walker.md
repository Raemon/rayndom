Join us for this special community opening reception for _Fortuna and the Immortality Garden (Machine)*_ , a newly commissioned work by Kara Walker. The fascinating installation features a field of automatons trapped in a never-ending cycle of ritual and struggle. These robotic dolls, repositories of the human soul, recall mechanized medieval icons that evidenced divinity, vitality, and the promise of faith. This free public opening reception will include a cash bar. 

_Fortuna and the Immortality Garden (Machine)_ will open to the public starting at 10 a.m. on July 1, with the reception to follow from 4–6 p.m. that day.
