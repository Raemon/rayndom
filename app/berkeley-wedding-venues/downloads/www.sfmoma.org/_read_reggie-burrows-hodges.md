#### About

_Reggie Burrows Hodges: Incline_ features the debut of _Labor: Keepers Orchard_ , the Bay Area artist’s newest and largest painting to date. Made with paint and pastel on deep black grounds, Burrows Hodges’ softly beautiful narrative works feature people as they steer, serve, soar and shine. _Keepers Orchard_ is the most recent entry in Hodges’ series, _Labor_ , which highlights the people who tend the land, from the artist’s hometown of Compton to his current home in the Bay Area. In this monumental, 25-foot work, Hodges depicts a single worker in a sweeping California landscape with the majesty of Impressionist painting, shadowed by a contemporary awareness of the beauty, bitterness, and fragility of our world. The artist’s work suggests questions around our relationship to the environment at a crucial turning point: in which direction are we inclined to turn? 

_Reggie Burrows Hodges: Incline_ is part of SFMOMA’s _Bay Area Walls_ , a series of commissions and other site-responsive wall projects by local artists. Begun in 2020, the program is designed to support local artists who are keenly attuned to our community and current moment.
