Artwork status
    On view on Floor 4 as part of _Freeform: Experiencing Abstraction_

Cartoonish water drops appear to roll off the surface of _Things to Come,_ while its wooden supports reveal the artwork’s static structure. Murray further complicated the topography with thick swathes of paint from a palette knife and brushy strokes that were flicked, flung, and splattered. The artist drew from her surroundings for playful and edgy amalgamations such as this, choosing subjects as mundane as coffee cups or graffiti. The resulting organic forms resist simple identification while retaining a bold sense of vitality and exuberance.
