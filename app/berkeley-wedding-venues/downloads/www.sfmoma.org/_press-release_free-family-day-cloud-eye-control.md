### What:

The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) welcomes families and intergenerational audiences to the museum for its third [Free Family Day](https://www.sfmoma.org/event/free-family-day-april-2017/) on Sunday, April 23, 2017. While the museum is always free for visitors 18 and younger, on Free Family Day it is also free for up to two adults accompanying each visitor 18 and younger. Tickets are available _onsite only_ on April 23.

Free Family Day programming features a series of activations by the Los Angeles–based artist collective Cloud Eye Control with Chi-wang Yang, Anna “Oxygen” Huff and Miwa Matreyek. As Cloud Eye Control resituates their acclaimed performance piece, _Half Life_ , from the theater to the museum, visitors are invited to explore the many components that bring a performance to life — from immersive video, original music and digital animation to costumes and set design. 

Created in response to the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan, _Half Life_ examines cycles of destruction and rebirth, exploring the relationship between the body and the environment. Over two weekends, April 15–16 and 22–23, 2017, Cloud Eye Control presents short performances, as well as an array of artist-designed interactive technologies and “psychic armor” building workshops, culminating with Free Family Day on Sunday, April 23.

Free Family Days are generously supported by the John & Marcia Goldman Foundation and the Yerba Buena Community Benefit District.

[Cloud Eye Control: ](https://www.sfmoma.org/event/series/cloud-eye-control-half-life/)_[Half Life](https://www.sfmoma.org/event/series/cloud-eye-control-half-life/)_ is funded in part by the New England Foundation for the Arts’ National Theater Project, with funding from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

### Why:

_[Performance All Ages](/performance-all-ages) _brings newly commissioned, participatory artworks to intergenerational audiences and facilitates direct engagement with artists through workshops, gallery activations and live performances. Cloud Eye Control’s residency is the third and final in the series during the inaugural 2016–17 season, following [Chris Kallmyer: ](https://www.sfmoma.org/event/series/kallmyer-paradise-choir/)_[A Paradise Choir](https://www.sfmoma.org/event/series/kallmyer-paradise-choir/)_ and [Lucky Dragons: ](https://www.sfmoma.org/event/series/lucky-dragons-user-agreement/)_[User Agreement](https://www.sfmoma.org/event/series/lucky-dragons-user-agreement/)._
