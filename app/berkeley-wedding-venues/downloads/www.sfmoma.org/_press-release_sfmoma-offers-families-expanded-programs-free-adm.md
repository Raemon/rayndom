The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) is pleased to announce that its family programming will expand beginning in February 2008, with free admission extended to all program participants through June 2008. In addition to a twice-yearly Family Day, sponsored by Target, the museum will present The Family Studio twice each month, on the first and third Sundays. Recent grants from Target and The Wallace Foundation directly support the program expansion, as well as free admission to the museum for all families participating in the programs.

Target Family Days offer a full day of family-friendly programming that extends museum-wide. Activities include hands-on art projects, live performances, gallery tours, and more. The Family Studio features an afternoon of family-appropriate activities—a docent-led gallery tour, a hands-on art project, and a reading or video screening—organized around a theme that relates to works on view in the galleries.
