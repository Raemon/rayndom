How can we remember a bird call, a painting, or even a monument that does not exist yet? In Alexandra Pirici’s live performative artwork _Re-collection_ (2018–24), real and fictional references of lifeforms, artworks, songs, poetry, events, and sensations are remembered, combined, and recombined to be given new form and meaning by performers’ bodies. Bringing together elements of dance, sculpture, spoken word, and music, recollections —including ones specific to SFMOMA’s collection and the Bay Area’s history — become images in movement, actions, words, or sound.

For this presentation, the two performers’ bodies become moving sculptural forms alongside Alexander Calder’s kinetic sculptures. Visitors will be invited to consider these recollections in relation to fixed modes of artwork display and traditional notions of a museum collection.

**The live action will take place from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays from May 10 through 30** (except May 24) on Floor 3 within the [_Alexander Calder: Dissonant Harmony_](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/alexander-calder-dissonant-harmony/) exhibition and the adjacent Sculpture Terrace.  
  
**Cast of performers:** KJ Dahlaw, Emily Hansel, and Coral Martin.
