“This list is meant to be a point of departure — a compilation of resources that you can use to guide critical conversations in your home or broader community.”

Many of us at SFMOMA have turned to books and articles to keep us productive and mindful during this pivotal moment. Written by experts, academics, and parents, the following titles were recommended by museum staff and are meant to start a dialogue with young children around issues of race and equity. Like the texts featured in our reading list for adults and young adults, these works give needed perspective as we grapple with long-standing inequities in our institution, our city, and our country.

This list is meant to be a point of departure — a compilation of resources that you can use to guide critical conversations in your home or broader community. We’ve been inspired by other institutions’ reading lists, some of which you’ll find at the bottom of this page. We welcome your suggestions via social media [@sfmoma](https://www.instagram.com/sfmoma), or through email at [digital@sfmoma.org](mailto:digital@sfmoma.org). When submitting, please send over a brief sentence about why the book, article, or resource is important to include.
