###  Jenifer K Wofford's _VMD_

Expand details

Jenifer K Wofford’s painted mural pictures Victoria “Vicki” Manalo Draves, the first Asian American Olympic gold medalist, suspended in a pike in a vast gradient of color. Born and raised in San Francisco’s South of Market district, the Filipina American diver was also the first woman awarded gold medals for both the ten-meter platform and the three-meter springboard competitions at the London 1948 Olympic Games. For _VMD_ , Wofford was compelled by imagining a “soft inward focus combined with the mannered tension in her body’s position, both completely on display and totally inside herself.” Wofford’s mural is part of SFMOMA’s [_Bay Area Walls_](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/bay-area-walls/), a series of commissions and other site-responsive wall projects by local artists that actively engage with pressing issues of our time.
