**Lecture  
Full Bloom: The Art and Life of Georgia O’Keeffe**  
Hunter Drohojowska-Philp, art critic, journalist, and author, _Full Bloom: The Art and Life of Georgia O’Keeffe_  
Saturday, March 5, 2 p.m.  
Phyllis Wattis Theater

O’Keeffe was one of the most celebrated artists of the twentieth century, but behind her bold work was a woman misunderstood by even her most ardent admirers. O’Keeffe biographer Drohojowska-Philp discusses a little-known but difficult period in the artist’s life, the 1930s. A book signing follows in the Haas Atrium. In conjunction with the ongoing exhibition _Matisse and Beyond: The Painting and Sculpture Collection_.

$12 general; $8 SFMOMA members, students, and seniors.

**Opening Day Program  
Artist Talk: Gary Hill**  
Gary Hill, artist  
Thursday, March 24, 6:30 p.m.  
Phyllis Wattis Theater

Hill’s video works engage viewers on multiple levels, presenting alluring visuals and sounds while manipulating the audience’s sense of time and space. Hill discusses his interest in illusion and mitigated reality and reveals the techniques used to achieve his mesmerizing effects. In conjunction with the exhibition _Image, Body, Text: Selected Works by Gary Hill_ , on view March 24 through May 30.

$12 general; $8 SFMOMA members, students, and seniors.

**Art and Conversation  
Martha Rosler: Art and Urban Space**  
Jill Dawsey, curatorial associate, painting and sculpture, SFMOMA  
Friday, March 25, noon–1 p.m.  
Koret Visitor Education Center

Conceptual artist Rosler uses video, photography, text, installation, and performance to investigate urban environments. Dawsey examines Rosler’s interest in the city as a social space, with a focus on her video _Secrets from the Street: No Disclosure_ , 1980, featuring San Francisco’s Mission District. In conjunction with the ongoing exhibition _Between Art and Life: The Contemporary Painting and Sculpture Collection_.

Free with Museum admission.

**Film Series: Jeremy Blake**  
In conjunction with the exhibition _Jeremy Blake: Winchester_ , SFMOMA is pleased to present a special film series curated by artist Jeremy Blake with a screening each month from March through June.

**McCabe and Mrs. Miller**  
_By Robert Altman, 1971, 120 min._  
Thursday, March 10, 7 p.m.  
Phyllis Wattis Theater

In Altman’s masterful anti-Western, individuality is expunged by the irrepressible power of mythic American iconography, also a concern in Blake’s _Winchester_ trilogy. Warren Beatty stars as an enterprising businessman who succumbs to a world of brothels, gambling, and gunslinging in the Wild West.

$12 general; $8 SFMOMA members, students, and seniors.

**Hannie Caulder**  
_By Burt Kennedy, 1971, 85 min._  
Thursday, April 14, 7 p.m.  
Phyllis Wattis Theater

Blake notes a parallel between the plight of rifle heiress Sarah Winchester and that of Hannie Caulder, both of whom struggle to rectify wrongs caused by gun violence. Raquel Welch stars in this revenge tale with a lighter side.

$12 general; $8 SFMOMA members, students, and seniors.

**Art Sandwiched In  
The Critic**   
Kenneth Baker, art critic, _San Francisco Chronicle_ ; David Littlejohn, independent journalist; Tessa DeCarlo, independent journalist; moderator: Neal Benezra, director, SFMOMA  
Tuesday, April 19, noon–1:30 p.m.  
The Schwab Room

What is the role of the critic in the arts community? What should it be? This group of esteemed arts writers examines the degree to which critics influence what we see in galleries and museums.

$60 general; $55 SFMOMA members. Includes lunch. To purchase tickets, call the Modern Art Council at 415.357.4090.

Presented by the Modern Art Council, an auxiliary of SFMOMA.

**Lecture  
Artist Talk: Marilyn Minter**  
Marilyn Minter, artist; Joshua Shirkey, curatorial associate, painting and sculpture, SFMOMA  
Thursday, April 21, 6:30 p.m.  
Phyllis Wattis Theater

By exaggerating the conventions of fashion advertising, Minter’s paintings and photographs expose the seduction as well as the underside of glamour. Minter and Shirkey talk about the evolution of the artist’s work since 1969, discussing the way her recent images tap into deep-seated cultural anxieties about desire, beauty, and the body. In conjunction with the exhibition _New Work: Marilyn Minter_ , on view April 1 through July 24.

Free with Museum admission.

**Art and Conversation  
Van Deren Coke: Collecting 20th-Century Photography**  
Erin Garcia, curatorial associate, photography, SFMOMA  
Friday, April 29, noon–1 p.m.  
Koret Visitor Education Center

The current installation of _Picturing Modernity_ highlights photographs amassed during Van Deren Coke’s eight-year tenure as SFMOMA’s director of photography (1979–87). Garcia examines selected photographs illustrating Coke’s interests in Surrealism, photographic experimentation, and the emerging artists of his day.

Free with Museum admission.

**Phyllis Wattis Distinguished Lecture Series**  
Founded in 1995 through the generosity of Phyllis Wattis, this annual lecture series brings influential artists and thinkers to SFMOMA. This year’s distinguished lecturer is art critic and author Peter Schjeldahl, widely known for his writing in _The New Yorker_ as well as _The Village Voice_ , _The New York Times_ , and _ArtNews_.

**The Story of the Image**  
Peter Schjeldahl  
Thursday, April 7  
Reception: 6 p.m., The Schwab Room  
Lecture: 7 p.m., Phyllis Wattis Theater

In 1981, Schjeldahl wrote, “[Robert] Bechtle’s realism is symbolically vibrant. It makes a symbolic connection between the completely seen and the completely known.” In conjunction with the exhibition _Robert Bechtle: A Retrospective_ , on view through June 5, Schjeldahl uses Bechtle’s photorealist paintings as a starting point for exploring the narrative aspect of painting and its peculiar interplay with photography.

$15 general; $10 SFMOMA members, students, and seniors. Includes reception.

**A Conversation with Peter Schjeldahl**  
Peter Schjeldahl; Neal Benezra, director, SFMOMA; Janet Bishop,  
curator of painting and sculpture, SFMOMA  
Friday, April 8, 3 p.m.  
Phyllis Wattis Theater

Benezra and Bishop engage Schjeldahl in a wide-ranging discussion of photorealism and its role in the creation of contemporary art. A question-and-answer period with the audience follows the dialogue.

Free with Museum admission.
