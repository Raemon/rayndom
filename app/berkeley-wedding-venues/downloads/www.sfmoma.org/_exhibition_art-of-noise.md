Picture the last time music moved you. Imagine how the sound was amplified. Think about what initially drew you to that album cover or concert poster. How did design shape your experience? 

Explore this question with us in _Art of Noise_. This exhibition is a multi-sensory ode to how design has changed the way we’ve experienced music over the past 100 years. Don’t miss: 

**Floor-to-Ceiling Gallery of Music Graphics**

Pore over 400+ San Francisco psychedelic rock posters, featuring legendary bands like the Grateful Dead. See icons of graphic design by Milton Glaser and others. Mid-century modern album covers, as well as hip-hop, punk, and rave flyers complete this expansive display of incredible color and creativity.

**Music Technology and Innovative Product Design**

Chart over a century of sound in over 100 objects, from early phonographs to the Music: Not Impossible _Haptic Suit_ , which translates sound onto the skin through vibration. Discover experimental music devices with design choices that will surprise you. 

**teenage engineering’s Design Touch**

Settle into a seating landscape that invites you to connect with others through music. The Swedish music-tech company has applied their unconventional design mindset to the exhibition experience, from this plush, sound installation to the look and feel of the gallery spaces.
