### About

For William Scott, paintings are spaces of freedom to reinvent the past and imagine new futures. Guided by an optimism that something different is possible, the resulting compositions engage in grand acts of time travel that picture Scott and his community reborn. _Praise Frisco: Peace and Love in the City_ is William Scott’s largest painting to date. Commissioned in conjunction with [_Creative Growth: The House That Art Built_](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/creative-growth-the-house-that-art-built/), it merges two of his abiding interests: maplike renderings of San Francisco and portraits of the people who populate his life and dreams. He and his mother, for example, appear as youthful versions of themselves, smiling alongside members of their church and the musician Diana Ross. In the background is the Alice Griffith public housing development near the city’s Bayview–Hunters Point neighborhood, where Scott was raised. Scott’s realism expresses hopefulness and fantasy, culminating in a monumental celebration of “Praise Frisco,” his name for the new San Francisco he envisions for the future.

William Scott: _Praise Frisco: Peace and Love in the City_ is part of SFMOMA’s _Bay Area Walls_ , a series of commissions and other site-responsive wall projects by local artists. Begun in 2020, the program is designed to support local artists who are keenly attuned to our community and current moment.
