When does the impulse to see become an urge to spy, and the desire to capture an image become a compulsion to penetrate another’s private world? Through insightful essays and fearless images, _Exposed_ examines some of the most invasive and unsettling aspects of photography, including the use of the hidden camera, the production of erotic pictures, and the fascination with both celebrity and violence. Surveillance, a fact of life today, is explored as a tool of control and, in the hands of artists, a tool of resistance.

Since the rise of photography in the late nineteenth century, people have been fascinated by the camera’s ability to make private moments public. From Matthew Brady’s haunting images of Civil War dead to the present-day paparazzi’s brand of voyeurism-for-hire, photography has served to capture not only the posed portrait but also the personal, the intimate, the unexpected, and the taboo. This fascinating book examines the ways in which acts of voyeurism and surveillance have inspired, challenged, and expanded the medium of photography throughout its evolution.

Published in association with Yale University Press on the occasion of the exhibition _Exposed: Voyeurism, Surveillance, and the Camera Since 1870,_ held at Tate Modern, London (May 28–October 3, 2010), San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (October 30, 2010–April 17, 2011), and Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (May 21–September 11, 2011)
