# Connecting People to the Art of Our Time

At the heart of SFMOMA’s mission is a commitment to connecting people to the art of our time. Utilizing 2022–2023 data, this dashboard is meant to provide a transparent and interactive view into the museum’s progress to engage a broader audience; diversify our collections, visitors, board, and staff; and prioritize our strategic goals:

  * Assert our role in making the art of our time matter
  * Become a human-centered, community-driven museum
  * Transform our culture from the inside out
  * Cultivate sustainability and growth with creativity and impact

**2022-23 Notes**

  1. SFMOMA’s dashboard will continually evolve to reflect work in progress.
  2. Starting with our fiscal year 2020–2021 Dashboard, SFMOMA began taking a holistic, consistent approach on the methods and terminology used to capture data pertaining to identity factors. After soliciting input from staff and consultants, we implemented a new multi-factor, inclusive survey approach to data collection.
  3. Identity data collected for SFMOMA living artists, board, staff, and visitors for 2022–2023 is 100% self-reported, multi-factor, and reflects a more inclusive set of identity factor descriptors than the 2019–20 Dashboard.
  4. 2022–23 identity data for deceased artists was acquired through public record research and remains single-factor.
  5. SFMOMA’s dashboard is established in part as a tool for goal setting and establishing time-based milestones for diversity metrics. Learn more about our [DEI strategic goals](https://www.sfmoma.org/dei-actions/).
