Join **Alejandro Cartagena** for a look at his creative process to mark the opening of his SFMOMA exhibition, [_Alejandro Cartagena: Ground Rules_](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/alejandro-cartagena-ground-rules/). He will explore how his work is shaped by a deep investigation into the complex relationships between the natural environment, urban development, and civic life. Known for his research-driven approach, Cartagena begins each project by setting specific creative constraints that guide the development of his photographic series. In this talk, he’ll share how these decisions take shape — and how they ultimately lead to projects that reflect both the hyperlocal and the far-reaching impacts of urbanization on both climate and people. Through his images and archival research, Cartagena traces the lasting effects of development on communities and landscapes, revealing patterns and systems often hidden from view that offer a framework for understanding how we got here. 

The talk will be followed by a book signing.
