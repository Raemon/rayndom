SAN FRANCISCO, September 11, 2000—https://www.oracle.com/tellmemore/?304252) Launching what promises to be a signature San Francisco Bay Area event celebrating technology innovation and community involvement, Oracle Corporation, the largest provider of software for e-Business, and the Yerba Buena Alliance, a San Francisco Bay Area non-profit organization, today announced the first annual “Innovate At Yerba Buena Gardens”. This day-long community arts and music festival kicks off Oracle’s annual OpenWorld technology conference and will celebrate innovation and its impact within the community. The event will take place at San Francisco’s Yerba Buena Gardens on Sunday, October 1, 2000 from 11:00 a.m. through 6:00 p.m.

“Innovate At Yerba Buena Gardens” is open to the public and will feature interactive technology demonstrations, tours and exhibits of more than two dozen art galleries and museums, live musical performances featuring, among others, Sista Monica, Pride and Joy, Vinyl and Dave Wakeling from the English Beat. There will also be special presentations on how innovation has impacted technology, art, and the community from Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s chairman and chief executive officer, and Professor Gary Hamel, author of “Leading the Revolution.”

“Innovate At Yerba Buena Gardens” is a celebration of technology and its influence with the community. The festival will feature unique pieces of art, music, and the first annual Innovate Derby which showcases the best and brightest B2B and B2C technology innovators and the many ways in which technology has impacted individuals.  
“We are excited to have this opportunity to collaborate with Oracle and explore new realms of imagination in art and technology,” said Alliance executive director Anita Hill. “This event marks the beginning of a relationship that will continue to benefit the community for years to come.”

According to Hill, Innovate At Yerba Buena Gardens will transform the heart of San Francisco into a creative assembly of technology, art and education with activities that include free admission to the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the California Historical Society, the Cartoon Art Museum and the Ansel Adams Center/The Friends of Photography . Local schools will also participate in contests that highlight animation technology and video production. A special Innovation Trivia Contest will also be featured.
