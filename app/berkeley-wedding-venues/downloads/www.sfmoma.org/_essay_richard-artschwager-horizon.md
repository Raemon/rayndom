![](https://d1hhug17qm51in.cloudfront.net/www-media/2019/04/23134138/Horizon.jpg) Richard Artschwager, _[Horizon](https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/fc-408-3/),_ 1990; etching, aquatint, lift-ground etching, spit-bite etching, and drypoint, 36 x 46 1/2 in. (91.4 x 118.1 cm); The Doris and Donald Fisher Collection at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, © The Estate of Richard Artschwager / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York

[_Horizon_](https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/fc-408-3/) is part of a group of three rare etchings Artschwager made in 1990 and published with Marian Goodman Gallery’s Multiples Inc. Based on press photos and one of the artist’s own drawings, these works challenge perception by shifting between real and imagined spaces.

The etchings are at once intimately connected and markedly different in their imagery and inspiration. The two other prints in the group, [_Building Riddled with Listening Devices (Alpha)_](https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/fc-408-1/)and _[Building Riddled with Listening Devices (Beta)](https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/fc-408-2/),_ are drawn from a _New York Times_ photograph of the unfinished United States embassy in Moscow five years after the infamous revelation that Soviet contractors had bugged the structure. _Horizon_ departs from this source and subject to depict an eponymous charcoal drawing the artist made in 1989. Here, on either side of a gallery-like room, abstracted desert views with thick frames appear either as windows or as pictures that echo Artschwager’s experimental landscapes of his childhood home in New Mexico. Despite the jump from a real edifice to an imagined interior, visual cues connect _Horizon_ to the other prints. While the original charcoal drawing has areas of exposed creamy paper that brighten the composition, the coarse, grainy background and softened, hazy contrast of the etching mimic the grisaille tone of the rest of the series. The delicate shading of the molding accents the depth of the room and mirrors the sharp linear perspective of the other two works, while the grid of rings on the floor recalls their loopy, textured backgrounds. Together, the viewpoint and origins shift across the three etchings to create an amalgam of drawing, photography, and printmaking.
