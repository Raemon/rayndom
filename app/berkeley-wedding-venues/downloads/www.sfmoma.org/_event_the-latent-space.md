Interact with the work of Alejandro Cartagena through _The Latent Space_ , an AI-driven large-scale projection. Designed and developed by Hugues Bruyère in collaboration with Cartagena, _The Latent Space_ is an AI model trained on the artist’s photographs of homes and urban environments to explore representational bias in training datasets. By manipulating physical objects, viewers can shape and transform the projected image, revealing new outputs generated by the model.
