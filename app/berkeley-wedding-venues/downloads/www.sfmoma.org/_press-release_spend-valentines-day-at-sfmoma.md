Heart to Heart Bow Tie ($48)

This Valentine’s Day the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) invites couples, singles, and lovers of all kinds to avoid the cliché of flowers and candy by celebrating the occasion a bit more creatively. Romantic writers can celebrate the intimate correspondence between photographer Alfred Stieglitz and painter Georgia O’Keeffe with “The Love Letters of Stieglitz and O’Keeffe,” a Free Tuesday Program on February 7. Amorous art buffs can steal away at lunchtime for a special Valentine’s Day Love Tour, a docent-led walk through the painting and sculpture collection, focusing on the museum’s most “romantic” holdings. And all week long sweethearts will find ways to spoil each other in the MuseumStore with special Valentine’s Day gift offerings and a creme fraiche parfait and heart-topped lattes from the Blue Bottle Coffee Bar.

**The Love Letters of Stieglitz and O’Keeffe**

Sarah Greenough, author and curator of photography, National Gallery of Art

Phyllis Wattis Theater

Photographer Alfred Stieglitz and painter Georgia O’Keeffe traded more than 5,000 letters over the course of their relationship as acquaintances, lovers, and eventually husband and wife. Sarah Greenough’s recent publication _My Far Away One: Selected Letters of Georgia O’Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz_ tracks 650 of the famous couple’s exchanges, written between 1915 and 1933. Greenough will discuss her book followed by a book signing in the theater.

Museum and program admission are free.

**Docent-Led Love Tours**

Tuesday, February 14, 11:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m., and 2:30 p.m.

**Inspired Valentine’s Gifts**

From distinct, handcrafted jewelry to red-hot accessories, the MuseumStore’s award-winning inventory of art books, gifts, and housewares offer creative Valentine’s Day gift ideas. Say “I love you” with hand-sculpted love pendant necklaces by Tina Frey ($78). Spice up the day with a reproduction of Pop artist Robert Indiana’s iconic LOVE sculpture, made of brushed aluminum in a jolt of red that adds sizzle to any work surface ($75). For the littlest Valentine, _Hug Time_ by Patrick McDonnell tells the story of a kitten so filled with love he wanted to give the whole world a hug ($6.99). And suit up for a festive evening of love in heart to heart ties and bow ties designed by Jenny Rinzler.

**Sweet Indulgences**

SFMOMA’s Blue Bottle Coffee Bar in the picturesque rooftop garden will offer delicious temptations on Valentine’s Day with a special selection of desserts designed to satisfy even the most decadent appetite. Inspired by the Raymond Pettibon painting of two hearts, _No Title (Paint fills them)_ (2003), the art-savvy pastry team behind Blue Bottle will offer a special new creme fraiche parfait with maraschino cherries.
