Alicia McCarthy, Lindsey White, Liam Everett, K.r.m. Mooney, and Sean McFarland are the 2017 recipients of an award established in 1967 by the Society for the Encouragement of Contemporary Art (SECA), an SFMOMA art experience group that honors exceptional local artists who have not yet received significant recognition from major institutions. This vibrant catalogue, published in conjunction with an award exhibition, offers immersive encounters with their work, which ranges from video and photography to painting and sculpture; abstract to figurative; humorous to sublime. Introducing each artist to larger audiences with evocative essays and illuminating interviews by SECA Art Award co-curators Jenny Gheith and Erin O’Toole, as well as full-color reproductions, this publication celebrates five of the most innovative artists working in the Bay Area today.

Published on the occasion of the exhibition _2017 SECA Art Award: Alicia McCarthy, Lindsey White, Liam Everett, K.r.m. Mooney, Sean McFarland,_ held at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (July 15–September 17, 2017)
