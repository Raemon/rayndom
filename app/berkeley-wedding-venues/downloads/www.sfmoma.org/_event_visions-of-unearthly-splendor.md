Experience an evening of otherworldly, enchanting, and psychedelic California film and video works inspired by _Stephen Kaltenbach: Portrait of My Father_ , a new publication by San Francisco curator and writer **Jordan Stein**. This event, with a special appearance by artist **Stephen Kaltenbach** , celebrates an illustrated oral history of his making _Portrait of My Father_ (1972–79), a 20th-century masterpiece on permanent view at the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento. Blazing a bold new conceptual trail in the early 1970s, the artist traded his heady downtown New York art world for a rural Northern California barn, where he spent most of the decade painting this enormous — and enormously cosmic — portrait of his dying father. The eclectic program illuminates various subjects at play in the book, including resplendent visions, spiritual awakening, and the ineffable nature of human consciousness. 

Stein introduces each film with a short reading and joins Kaltenbach in conversation after the screenings. 

Visions of Unearthly Splendor is presented in collaboration with Canyon Cinema.

### About the Speakers

**Jordan Stein** is a curator and writer based in San Francisco. He is the author of _Miyoko Ito: Heart of Hearts_ (Pre-Echo Press, 2024), a _New York Times_ “Best Art Book of the Year,” _Rip Tales: Jay DeFeo’s Estocada & Other Pieces_ (Soberscove Press, 2021), and most recently, _Stephen Kaltenbach: Portrait of My Father_ (J&L Books, 2025). In 2017, he founded [Cushion Works](https://www.cushionworks.info/), an exhibition space in the Mission District that aims to link past and present through the varied presentation of critical — and often overlooked — artworks, histories, and ideas. He has independently organized exhibitions at the Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive, Artists Space, Yale Union, San Francisco City Hall, The Glass House, Matthew Marks Gallery, Fraenkel Gallery, and The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, where he formerly served as curator of special projects. 

Sculptor, painter, and conceptual artist **Stephen Kaltenbach** is best known for his enigmatic time capsules — sealed metal cases with inscriptions, sometimes hinting at their hidden contents, sometimes directing their use. Kaltenbach’s interest in the relationship between the visible and the concealed and the determination of when an artwork becomes itself questions basic assumptions about the way art operates. Kaltenbach’s work has been exhibited at the Walker Art Center; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and the Whitney Museum of American Art. He was a 1979–80 Guggenheim fellow and his work is found in public collections around the world, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Kröller-Müller Museum in the Netherlands.
