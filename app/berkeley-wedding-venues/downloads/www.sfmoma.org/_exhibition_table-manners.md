Imagine a dinner party with your six favorite artists.

_Table Manners_ brings together tableware, flatware, and drinkware from the SFMOMA Architecture + Design collection spanning nearly 100 years. The exhibition celebrates the ways design has shaped our relationship to food, our bodies, and communities, and how dining can be a profound communal and cultural experience. From self-filling wine glasses and teapots made of tea, to crisp modernist spoons and flatware made from discarded CDs, _Table Manners_ explores the performance of dining. The exhibition includes works by Virgil Abloh, Joe Colombo, Zaha Hadid, Roberto Lugo, and many more, accompanied by illustrations and textiles by Lucy Stark.
