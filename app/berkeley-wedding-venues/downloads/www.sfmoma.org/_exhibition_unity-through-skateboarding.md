Skateboarding has always been about more than tricks and competitions. It is a culture rooted in rebellion, creativity, style, and the pursuit of freedom. This exhibition, curated by Jeffrey Cheung and Gabriel Ramirez, founders of the skate collective Unity, celebrates the dreams and realities of queer, trans, BIPOC, and women skaters as well as the diverse communities that have shaped the sport, despite histories of hypermasculinity and exclusionary attitudes. Meet the pioneers who broke barriers, from the first women and queer skaters to go pro, to the underground movements that encouraged inclusivity and change in skateboarding. Through skateboards that represent queer and women skaters and artists, skate publications and zines, artworks, photographs, videos, and more, the works featured here explore how communities have fostered unity through a shared ethos of passion and determination. Just as skaters who, despite injuries and setbacks, persistently attempt a trick until they land it, _Unity through Skateboarding_ encourages us to keep pushing for a more inclusive world, both on and off the board.
