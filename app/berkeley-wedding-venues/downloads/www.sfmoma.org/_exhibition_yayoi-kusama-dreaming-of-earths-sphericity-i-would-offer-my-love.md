Experience the kaleidoscopic world of [Yayoi Kusama](https://www.sfmoma.org/artist/Yayoi_Kusama/), one of the most iconic and globally celebrated artists working today. Kusama’s _Dreaming of Earth’s Sphericity, I Would Offer My Love_ (2023), welcomes the viewer into a universe of multicolored light. At first, the exterior of this sculptural work blends into the gallery’s all-white surroundings, punctuated by an array of large transparent acrylic dots, including a quadrant—or quarter-dot—door at one corner for visitors to enter. In the interior, bright ambient light filters through the colored windows to create a luminous pattern of overlapping circles. As visitors turn around in the space, the mirrored surfaces create an environment that is constantly in flux.
