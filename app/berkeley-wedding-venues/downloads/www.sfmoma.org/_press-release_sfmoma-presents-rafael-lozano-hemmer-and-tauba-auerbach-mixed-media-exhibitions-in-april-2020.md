SAN FRANCISCO, CA (November 12, 2019) — The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) will present two major exhibitions celebrating the mixed media work of contemporary artists Rafael Lozano-Hemmer and Tauba Auerbach this spring. The artist’s first major survey exhibition in the U.S., _Rafael Lozano-Hemmer: Unstable Presence_ (April 25–November 1, 2020) will explore our presence in fundamentally turbulent environments through a focused selection of 16 engaging installations on the museum’s seventh floor. Simultaneously on the museum’s fourth floor, Auerbach’s first museum survey, _Tauba Auerbach_ — _S v Z_(April 25–September 7, 2020), will highlight her prolific and varied output over the last 16 years.

Also on view this spring will be select video projections from renowned interdisciplinary artists Cauleen Smith and Theaster Gates in _Future Histories_ (April 25–November 1, 2020).

### _Rafael Lozano-Hemmer: Unstable Presence_

April 25–November 1, 2020

Floor 7

Air and water, heartbeats and voices, text and light — these are the materials of media artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer. Over the past few decades, the Mexico City–born, Montreal-based artist has earned international recognition for large-scale participatory installations that frequently incorporate technology and the architecture of public spaces. On view in the U.S. exclusively at SFMOMA, _Rafael Lozano-Hemmer: Unstable Presence_ brings together recent sculptural installations and immersive environments realized on microscopic and macroscopic scales. These works engage visitors’ sense of play, and anxiety, as they experience the implications of technology and behaviors of participation in social and political contexts.

“ _Unstable Presence_ refers to the dynamic, poetic, but also disturbing turbulence that characterizes social and technical interrelations,” said Rudolf Frieling, curator of media arts at SFMOMA. “Materializing on various scales, from the personal to the geopolitical, the instability of these layers of presence is powerfully echoed in the atmospheric but also sculptural installations.”

_Rafael Lozano-Hemmer: Unstable Presence_ additionally examines the concept of “co-presence” by highlighting how our physical presence and the natural and technological spaces we inhabit form a continuous stream of interaction. Lozano-Hemmer noted, “Presence is often associated with existence, continuity in time or material reality. The ‘unstable’ in the exhibition’s title refers to interaction, improvisation and performance. The instability brought by participation allows constant reinterpretation of the work, where many outcomes are co-present.”

The exhibition focuses on three major themes in Lozano-Hemmer’s work: observation and surveillance; text-based poetic work; and the instability of systems. Highlights of the presentation include the following installations, the majority of which encourage visitor participation:

**_Airborne Newscast_** (2013) projects live news feeds from prominent international news outlets, such as Reuters, Agencia EFE, Notimex, AlterNet and AP. When visitors enter the space, their shadows disrupt the projections and dissolve the projected words into smoke-like patterns, creating an unstable atmospheric effect.

**_Call on Water_** (2016) is a fountain from which words emerge as plumes of vapor, produced by hundreds of computer-controlled ultrasonic atomizers. Fragment by fragment, poems by the celebrated Mexican writer Octavio Paz briefly materialize in the mist before dissipating in turbulence.

**_Pulse Spiral_** (2008) consists of hundreds of incandescent lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling in a three-dimensional spiral. This participatory installation records and responds to the heart rates of visitors holding sensors, transforming their heartbeats into mesmerizing flashes of light.

**_Sphere Packing: Bach_** (2018), the largest in Lozano-Hemmer’s _Sphere Packing_ series, is a three-meter spherical frame supporting 1,128 loudspeakers, each simultaneously playing a different composition by Johann Sebastian Bach. Visitors can enter the sphere and be surrounded by the cacophonous crescendo of Bach’s entire musical output.

**_Vicious Circular Breathing_** (2013) is a large sculptural installation featuring brown paper bags that inflate and deflate at human breathing rates; a set of motorized bellows and valves that control the bags; and a sealed glass room with a decompression chamber. Visitors are invited to enter the glass room to breathe the air that was previously breathed by earlier participants. The piece includes warnings about the risks of asphyxiation, contagion and panic, offering a statement on the limits of the planet’s resources as well as a commentary on participation, which in this case makes the air more toxic for future visitors.

**_Voz Alta_** _[Out Loud]_ (2008) commemorates the 40th anniversary of the massacre of hundreds of students in Tlatelolco, Mexico City, on October 2, 1968. The original site-specific “anti-monument” is presented in the gallery as a functional prototype: participants are invited to step up to a megaphone and speak freely, their speech translated into light flashes via a miniature searchlight. An FM radio transmitter relays the sounds to which the light corresponds, and an archival recording of the 2008 memorial plays after a participant has finished speaking. In this way, the memory of the tragedy in Tlatelolco is mixed with live participation.

**_Zoom Pavilion_** (2015) is an interactive installation created in collaboration with artist Krzysztof Wodiczko. Consisting of projections fed by computerized surveillance footage, the work uses face recognition and other tracking algorithms to detect the presence of participants and record their spatial relationships. Independent cameras zoom in to amplify images with up to 35x magnification. The zooming sequences become disorienting as they change the image landscape from easily recognizable wide shots of the crowd to abstract close-ups.

### _Tauba Auerbach — S v Z_

April 25–September 7, 2020

Floor 4

Tauba Auerbach studies the boundaries of perception through an art and design practice grounded in math, science and craft. Her multifaceted interests often focus on issues of duality, interconnectedness, rhythm and form, and intersect with questions about the structure of the universe. This exhibition, the San Francisco native’s first museum survey, spans 16 years of her career and highlights the relationships between the range of media and concepts she engages. Included are compositions that explore the properties of letters and symbols; drawings, books and large-scale installations that complicate binary relationships; trompe l’oeil paintings that experiment with depth and dimension; weavings and glass sculptures embedded with various waveforms; and videos that interpret theories in quantum physics.

“Auerbach moves fluidly across disciplines and interests,” said Joseph Becker, SFMOMA associate curator of architecture and design, “from developing tools and methodologies for her paintings and sculptures which play upon our perceptions of space and time, to probing semiotics and design with her work in typography and architectural ornament.”

“Auerbach is one of those rare artists who has the ability to open numerous worlds at once by connecting her exploration of the symbolic capacity of geometric form to concepts and fields that expand our understanding of nature, our anatomy and consciousness,” continued Jenny Gheith, SFMOMA assistant curator of painting and sculpture.

The immersive presentation will be designed by Auerbach, along with an in-depth catalogue that serves as both an artist book and an index of work, process and references, created in collaboration with graphic designer David Reinfurt. The subtitle _S v Z_ encapsulates Auerbach’s longstanding consideration of symmetry and texture, key aspects of her practice that are represented in both the exhibition and the catalogue’s design, including the typeface and layout.

A comprehensive survey of Auerbach’s practice, this exhibition will explore several fundamental themes including language, ornament, flow, logic, the helix and time. Major bodies of work featured in the presentation will include:

**_Auerglass Organ_**(2009)

The _Auerglass Organ_ is a two-person collaborative pump organ created by Tauba Auerbach and the musician Cameron Mesirow (also known as Glasser). The Auerglass will be performed throughout the run of the exhibition.

**_Folds_** (2009–13)

The _Fold_ paintings are an exploration of dimensionality and the technical process of painting, comprising trompe l’oeil compositions that give the appearance of being three-dimensional while existing on a flat canvas.

**_Weaves_** (2012–15)

In the _Weaves_ series, Auerbach explores the materiality and structure of canvas itself by creating interwoven surfaces that form complex patterns based on architecture and light.

**_Grain_** (2017–present)

The _Grain_ paintings are created with custom-made tools that Auerbach drags through layers of color, resulting in canvases that are embedded with ornamental and fractal forms read through the physicality of gesture.

**Diagonal Press** (2013 to present)

Diagonal Press is the artist’s imprint for open-editioned publications, including books, typographic specimens, jewelry and mathematical toys.

### _Future Histories: Theaster Gates and Cauleen Smith_

April 25–November 1, 2020

Floor 7

Bringing together the work of two interdisciplinary artists, this presentation will center on video projections that use archival journalistic photography as a point of departure. The U.S. premiere of Theaster Gates’s _Do you hear me calling? Mama Mamama or What Is Black Power?_(2018) will explore the idea of the Black Madonna by reworking three decades of images drawn from the Johnson Publishing Company archives, which includes _Ebony_ and _Jet_ magazines. In this two-channel video installation, Gates interweaves scenes of musicians and singers, including the artist and his ensemble, amplifying a performative approach to cultural legacies. This year a consortium of foundations acquired the archives for The Getty Research Institute and the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.

Cauleen Smith’s _Sojourner_ (2018) culminates with a feminist reimagining of an unpublished photograph from a 1966 _Life_ magazine assignment. Throughout this film, banners with phrases conveyed by American jazz musician Alice Coltrane Turiyasangitananda are used in performances by women at different sites associated with community organizing or artistic vision, such as the outdoor desert assemblages of Noah Purifoy in California. Smith’s film _Lessons in Semaphore_ (2015), where choreographer taisha paggett uses flags to activate a vacant lot in Chicago, will also be on view. Presented in conjunction with this exhibition will be film programs including the Bay Area debut of Smith’s audiovisual performance _Black Utopia LP_ (2012) on May 21, 2020 in SFMOMA’s Phyllis Wattis Theater.

### Support

Meaningful support for _Future Histories: Theaster Gates and Cauleen Smith_ is provided by Wayee Chu and Ethan Beard.
