Widely recognized for his singular approach towards sound and new technologies, Samson Young (born 1979, Hong Kong; based in Hong Kong) utilizes performance, video, and installation to rigorously examine the cultural, political, and historical contexts of sound. Samson Young’s first West Coast solo exhibition debuts _Intentness and songs_ , a multimedia installation that poetically traces the idiosyncratic rhythms of love, memory, and experiences of time. In this interconnected audiovisual landscape, Young draws on the duration and rhythm of human and generative AI memory recall processes as the basis for polychromatic sculptures, videos, and a mesmerizing soundscape. Visitors are invited to wander through pathways of wooden boards with markings created through a mix of techniques and 3D-printed boards etched and embedded with objects and memories excerpted from the lives of the artist and his husband.
