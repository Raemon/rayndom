As American expatriates in bohemian Paris when the 20th century was young, Gertrude Stein and her family were among the first to recognize the talents of avant-garde painters like Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. SFMOMA’s major summer exhibition _The Steins Collect: Matisse, Picasso, and the Parisian Avant-Garde_ tells the stories behind the famous canvases, offering a rare, in-depth encounter with the artworks and the extraordinary people who facilitated the birth of modern art. In conjunction with the exhibition (on view from May 21 through September 6, 2011), the museum will present the following public programs and events. Tickets are available at the museum (no surcharge) or through sfmoma.org/tickets (surcharge applies) unless otherwise noted.

**OPENING PROGRAM**

**Curator Panel Discussion**

Janet Bishop, curator of painting and sculpture, SFMOMA; Cécile Debray, curator of historical collections, Musée National d’Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris; Rebecca Rabinow, associate curator of 19th-century, modern, and contemporary art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art; Gary Tinterow, Engelhard Chairman, Department of 19th-Century, Modern, and Contemporary Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art

Thursday, May 19, 7 p.m. • Phyllis Wattis Theater, SFMOMA

Tickets: $10 general; $7 SFMOMA members, students, and seniors; does not include entry to _The Steins Collect_.

Reassembling long-dispersed historical collections that had tremendous impacts on the trajectory of modern art, _The Steins Collect_ presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience and understand a central moment in the history of art. This panel explores the exhibition’s intertwining stories with the four curators who collaborated for four years to produce it.

**PHYLLIS WATTIS DISTINGUISHED LECTURE**

Wayne Koestenbaum, cultural critic and distinguished professor of English, City University of New York

Thursday, June 2, 7 p.m. • Phyllis Wattis Theater, SFMOMA

Tickets: $10 general; $7 SFMOMA members, students, and seniors; does not include entry to _The Steins Collect_.

Essayist, cultural critic, and poet Koestenbaum is one of the most energetic and original writers working today. With books like _The Queen’s Throat: Opera, Homosexuality and the Mystery_ _of Desire_ and _Hotel Theory_ , he has made an unparalleled contribution to the writing of queer cultural history. Gertrude Stein was a key figure in that history as well as in the development of modern art in early 20th-century Paris. For this year’s Phyllis Wattis Distinguished Lecture, SFMOMA has commissioned Koestenbaum to write a new piece related to _The Steins Collect_ ; his topic: painting and writing.

**SPECIAL EVENT**

**Living Room**

Margaret Tedesco, artist, publisher, and curator; additional participants to be announced.

Saturday, June 4, 11:30 a.m.–6 p.m.• The Schwab Room, SFMOMA

Free and open to the public; does not include entry to _The Steins Collect_.

The Stein family’s Saturday salons in their Paris apartments were the crucible of the avant-garde art and writing of the period. In keeping with the spirit of those informal gatherings, this event transforms the museum’s free public spaces into a “living room,” complete with a conversation pit, hosted by a range of Bay Area visual and literary artists and organized by Tedesco. At the same time, poets from around the Bay will perform a daylong reading of selections from Gertrude Stein’s epic _The Making of Americans_ in the museum’s Haas Atrium.

**PANEL DISCUSSION**

**Queer Culture and Artists’ Circles**

Tammy Rae Carland, artist; Jonathan Katz, chair, Visual Studies Doctoral Program, SUNY, Buffalo; Wayne Koestenbaum, cultural critic and distinguished professor of English, City University of New York

Saturday, June 4, 4:30 p.m. • Phyllis Wattis Theater, SFMOMA

Free and open to the public; does not include entry to _The Steins Collect_.

Carland, Katz, and Koestenbaum discuss how artistic circles form and transform visual and literary artistic practices, and the place of such circles in queer histories of modern and contemporary culture. This panel coincides with our program _Living Room,_ which explores the function of the salon in supporting marginal or emerging ideas and practices. Koestenbaum is SFMOMA’s 2010 Phyllis Wattis distinguished lecturer. Katz curated _Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire_ _in American Portraiture_ and is the author of _The Homosexualization of American Art: Jasper Johns,_ _Robert Rauschenberg and the Collective Closet_.

Henry King, 1957, 130 min., 35mm

Thursday, June 9, 7 p.m.

King’s 1957 interpretation of Ernest Hemingway’s novel illuminates the condition and characteristics of post-World War I expatriates in Paris, dubbed “The Lost Generation” by Hemingway’s friend, mentor, and patron Gertrude Stein. The contingent of American writers and artists included F. Scott Fitzgerald, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and many others, with Stein at the creative helm. This film follows Hemingway’s narrator Jake Barnes through romantic dalliances, existential digressions, and moments of both inspiration and despair to emerge with a profound understanding of the recurrent themes of avant-garde life and literature.

**_The Moderns_**

Alan Rudolph, 1988, 126 min., 35mm

Thursday, June 16, 7 p.m.

_The Moderns_ follows Nick Hart, a struggling painter at the center of the expatriate culture of 1920s Paris, as he navigates the Left Bank milieu.

It looks especially at the work of Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Gertrude Stein, three of the most adventurous artists of the period. Lecturers include Janet Bishop, curator of painting and sculpture at SFMOMA; Dara Solomon, curator at the Contemporary Jewish Museum; and Renate Stendhal, editor of _Gertrude Stein in Words and Pictures._

**FILM SERIES**

**Opera on Film**

Thursdays, July 14 and 21; August 4 and 25; 7 p.m. • Phyllis Wattis Theater, SFMOMA

Each screening: $5 general; free for SFMOMA members or with museum admission (requires a free ticket, which can be picked up in the Haas Atrium); does not include entry to _The Steins Collect._

In conjunction with the new production of Virgil Thomson and Gertrude Stein’s opera [_Four Saints in Three Acts_](https://www.ybca.org/) _,_ SFMOMA presents films that take opera as an influence on either their form or subject matter, exploring the range of the opera/film encounter. Though they were originally disparate art forms, opera’s emotional rigor lends itself to cinematic storytelling, while film’s visual possibilities enrich the spectacle of opera.

**_The Magic Flute_**

William Kentridge, 2005, 180 min., video

Thursday, July 14, 7 p.m.

For South African artist William Kentridge, opera is a natural pairing with the video and charcoal work he is best known for. In this 2005 production of Mozart’s The Magic Flute, Kentridge reframes the opera’s original themes of Enlightenment philosophy through the bitter legacy of colonialism. In German with electronic libretto in Italian, English, and German (subtitles).

**_Diva_**

Jean-Jacques Beineix, 1981, 117 min., 35mm

Thursday, July 21, 7 p.m.

In this film, a young postman with a passion for opera makes a bootleg of his favorite opera diva, a

celebrated African American soprano who refuses to make recordings. Amidst a burgeoning relationship

with the singer, our hero is chased through Paris by Taiwanese music pirates and evil henchman seeking

an altogether different recording in his possession. This slick thriller ushered in the 1980s Cinéma du Look movement. In French with English subtitles.Print courtesy of Rialto Pictures.

**_Carmen Jones_**

Otto Preminger, 1954, 105 min.

Thursday, August 4, 7 p.m.

Preminger’s Carmen Jones sticks closely to the original score of Georges Bizet’s opera Carmen, though

the cast, lyrics, and story are modernized in surprising ways: the events are set in World War II America

and the entire cast is African American. Don Jose becomes an all-American GI Joe, played by Harry

Belafonte, and Carmen becomes parachute factory worker Carmen Jones, a role that won Dorothy

Dandridge a Best Actress Oscar nomination. Print courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox Archives.

**_Tommy_**

Ken Russell, 1974, 100 min., 35mm

Thursday, August 25, 7 p.m.

Its conceit is familiar by now: a deaf, dumb, and blind kid plays a mean pinball. Yet Russell’s phantasmagoric realization of The Who’s rock opera album is wholly unexpected. Ann-Margaret rolls around in baked beans (garnering an Academy Award nomination); Elton John, as the reigning Pinball Wizard, plays a piano built into a 10-foot tall pinball machine; and Tina Turner gives an electrifying performance as the Acid Queen who tries to heal Tommy with a double dose of sex and LSD. Print courtesy of SonyPictures Repertory.

**GOOGLE FREE FAMILY DAY**

Sundays, July 17, 11 a.m.–4 p.m. • SFMOMA
