On Wednesday, April 25, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA)’s highly anticipated 2012 Modern Ball—the Bay Area’s biggest art bash of the year and the institution’s premier fundraising gala—will transform the museum into a gigantic, ultrachic party.

With three decked-out venues to explore—the Gala Dinner, the Supper Club, and the Post-Modern Party—the Modern Ball promises a night of artful revelry, with sumptuous fare, cocktails, luxurious lounges, dancing, art, and a DJ set by acclaimed Montreal-based electrofunk duo Chromeo at the zenith of it all.

The event is chaired by SFMOMA Trustee Dolly Chammas, with honorary chairs Helen and Charles Schwab. Event designer Stanlee R. Gatti will bring his signature wit and creative flair to the décor. This year’s affair will have a Picasso-inspired theme, nodding to the artist’s defining impact on modernism. For instance, the Gala Dinner setting will conjure Picasso’s Blue Period, and the Supper Club lounge scene will channel the painter’s cubist style and fascination with African artifacts. With suggested attire as “dress up!” fashionistas and style-spotters should have plenty of inspiration.

The Modern Ball raises crucial funds for SFMOMA’s programs, enabling the museum to serve more than 50,000 students, teachers, and families each year with free access to innovative education programs. Proceeds also help provide free or reduced admission for over 180,000 families and community members.

Gala Dinner guests will enjoy a five-star feast featuring **McCalls** catering, **Ruinart** champagne, **Robert Mondavi** wines, and entertainment by **DJ Vin Sol** and **Hot Club**. The Gala venue also features a live auction led by **Christie’s George McNeely** , with premier items such as work by guest artist **Doug Aitken** and an America’s Cup Package offering a day at the races aboard the beautiful Far Niente Yacht. At the Supper Club**,** partygoers mingle in a stylish lounge with signature cocktails by **Patrόn Tequila** , gourmet culinary stations, and irresistible dance music by **DJ CAMS**. Guests at both venues will then converge with additional revelers at the Post-Modern Party, a museumwide fete with bubbly by **Chandon** ; late-night bites by **Aziza** , **Bix** , and **Tacolicious** , and others; a performance by**** pop-inflected disco band**Poolside;** and electrifying sets by **Chromeo** and celebrity chef **Hubert Keller**(_Fleur de Lys_), who will be wearing another hat as a DJ, spinning his world-beat and jazz-infused international club sounds. Patrόn will host its crowd-favorite photo booth all night long.

The Modern Ball is generously supported by the Mimi and Peter Haas Fund, Jan Shrem and Maria Manetti Shrem, and lead sponsors Wells Fargo and Giorgio Armani. SFMOMA would also like to thank the following for their crucial support: media sponsor _San Francisco_ magazine; wine sponsor Robert Mondavi Winery; champagne sponsors Ruinart and Chandon; Post-Modern Party media sponsor _SPIN_ ; production services provided by Got Light?; spirits sponsor Patrón Tequila; Gala Dinner Media Sponsor _Nob Hill Gazette_ ; and water sponsors Crystal Geyser Water Company and Crystal Geyser Spring Water by CG Roxane.

**About Chromeo**

The music of**** Montreal-based electrofunk duo Chromeo has been described as “a shameless return to the glistening, sex-saturated synth-pop which ruled the eighties.” The duo is composed of P-Thugg (Patrick Gemayel) on keyboards, synthesizers, and talk box; and Dave 1 (David Macklovitch) on guitar and lead vocals. Highlights of their 2004 debut album _She’s in Control_ include the club tracks “Needy Girl,” “Mercury Tears,” “Rage!,” and “Destination: Overdrive.” In 2005, Chromeo released a mix CD of dance tracks on Eskimo Belgium records entitled _Un Joli Mix Pour Toi_ (A Pretty Mix For You). During early 2007, Chromeo supported indie rock group Bloc Party on their British tour and released their second album, “Fancy Footwork.”

**About DJ Vin Sol**

Since Vin Sol first hit the clubs in 2000, he has performed solo and alongside acts such as M.I.A., Biz Markie, Too Short, Pete Rock, Diplo, The Rapture, A-Trak, and LCD Soundsystem. Whether playing intimate venues or festivals, his expansive vinyl collection and tight beat-matching keeps any crowd dancing. In 2011, he issued vinyl releases on labels Fool’s Gold Records and Scion A/V, and collaborated with Chromeo for BBC Radio 1.
