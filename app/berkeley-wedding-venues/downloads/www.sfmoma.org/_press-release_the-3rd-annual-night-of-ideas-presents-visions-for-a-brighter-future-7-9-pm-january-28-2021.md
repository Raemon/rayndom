SAN FRANCISCO, JANUARY 13, 2021 – Last February, more than 5,200 revelers from all corners of the Bay Area, and even as far as Portland, Oregon, flocked to the Main Library to enjoy a seven-hour marathon of speakers and performances at the second San Francisco edition of the **Night of Ideas**. An initiative of the Institut Français, Night of Ideas occurs on the same evening in more than 35 cities around the world. While gathering in person is out this year, the local event partners, Villa San Francisco, KQED, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), San Francisco Public Library and California Humanities, are reuniting to produce a free two-hour virtual showcase of some of the Bay Area’s leading performers and thinkers on January 28, 2021 from 7–9 p.m.

“I’m excited that we’re able to carry on this annual tradition of bringing together local thinkers and artists to share with us their visions for a brighter and more inclusive future,” said Mayor London N. Breed. “This Night of Ideas will remind us of everything that we love about our city and hopefully provide some fun and joy during an otherwise challenging time.”

From Finland to South Africa and from Sydney to San Francisco, more than 200 Night of Ideas will occur on the same evening. For San Francisco’s 2021 Night of Ideas livestream, keynote speakers and performers were asked to meditate on the theme of “closing the distance,” an adaptation of the international theme “proche” or “close.” The program will present a variety of perspectives on how we can collectively move closer to each other and to a better future by reimagining our civic spaces to be more inclusive and by advancing racial equity.

The program, which will be broadcasted globally from France by the Institut Français as part of a 24-hour program, is also designed to bring people closer to the Bay Area and to the individuals who make it special. Viewers can expect to see performances featuring some of the area’s iconic scenery and tributes to our artists and essential workers that have kept spirits up during these challenging times.

Hosted by Mina Kim, KQED journalist and host of _Forum_ , this year’s Night of Ideas will include:

  * A special conversation between Mina Kim and [San Francisco Mayor London N. Breed](https://sfmayor.org/about-mayor) on how the mayor plans to lead San Francisco through the recovery ahead.

“We are delighted to be reunited with our partners to present the third annual Night of Ideas,” says City Librarian Michael Lambert. “Pop some popcorn, pour your favorite beverage and prepare to discover something new about the beautiful Bay Area we call home.”

“Nothing could stop us from coming together online with our faithful partners for another very promising Night of Ideas!” says Frédéric Jung, Consul General of France in San Francisco. “For this global event, we are proud to gather the best of the amazing San Francisco Bay Area communities in order to offer a two-hour online live broadcast which will put San Francisco once again on the map of the worldwide Night of Ideas events”

“SFMOMA is excited to collaborate across public institutions through the third Night of Ideas. Now more than ever, it’s vital that we engage in meaningful dialogue about our future and art’s capacity not only to provoke questions and action but to spread joy and heal,” said Neal Benezra, Helen and Charles Schwab Director of SFMOMA. “In that vein, we will be distributing free artwork to the community through Tucker Nichols’s _Flowers for Sick People_. Nichols, a Night of Ideas presenter and artist featured in our upcoming exhibition _Close to Home: Creativity in Crisis_ , will have four limited edition prints available through San Francisco Public Library branches, so that you can send one of his flower prints to a loved one in need.”
