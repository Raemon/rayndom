# Archives Policies + Procedures

The Archives is located at the Collections Center (CC), SFMOMA’s collections storage and research facility. Access to the CC is granted by [appointment only](https://www.sfmoma.org/library-archives/about-archives/archives-policies-procedures/archives-appointment-request/).

  * Documents may not be removed from the reading room without permission.
  * Smoking, eating, and drinking are not permitted in the reading room.
  * Pens are prohibited; please use a pencil for note-taking. (Laptops are allowed, but laptop bags are not.)
  * Materials must lie flat on the tables; they may not be placed on laps, leaned on, written on, folded, traced from, or handled in any way likely to cause damage. Staff will provide book cradles if needed.
  * Researchers may remove only one folder at a time from the box.
  * Use the provided Out Card to mark the position of the folder in the box.
  * Researchers must preserve the existing arrangement of material within folders and boxes. If anything appears to be misfiled, call it to the attention of the staff, but do not rearrange it yourself.
  * SFMOMA reserves the right to set restrictions on access to and copying of archival materials.
  * Mark materials for copying by placing the provided paper flags vertically in the folder in front of the requested document. The end of the flag should stick out of the folder. The archivist will make copies for researchers.
  * Materials Request, Photocopy, Reproduction, and Permission to Publish forms are available from the archivist.
  * Researchers who notice damage to archival materials should bring it to the attention of the staff.
  * Everything brought into the reading room is subject to inspection upon arrival and departure.
