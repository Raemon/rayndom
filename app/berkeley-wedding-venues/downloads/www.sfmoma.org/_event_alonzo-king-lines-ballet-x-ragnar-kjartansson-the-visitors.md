For one day only, experience _Ragnar Kjartansson: The Visitors_ in a whole new way as **dancers from San Francisco’s world-renowned[Alonzo King LINES Ballet](https://linesballet.org/) perform live in conversation with the video installation**.

_The Visitors_ transports viewers to a distinct, immersive setting, where they become witnesses to the artistic process as both a singular and collective experience. In this special pop-up performance staged alongside the work, the artists of LINES Ballet complement, respond to, and expand upon the on-screen experience through choreography performed between the video projections that provides a living expression of the creative process.

Please note: There will be three to four dancers in _The Visitors_ at most times during this program. _The Visitors_ gallery may reach capacity at times during these performances. If you would prefer to experience _The Visitors_ without in-gallery dance on this day, please visit between 10:15 a.m.–noon or 4–4:45 p.m.

### About the Performers

Forty-three years of innovative, multidisciplinary collaborations place the **Alonzo King LINES Ballet** at the forefront of artistic innovation in dance. With each collaboration, LINES Ballet investigates deeply rooted affinities between Western and Eastern classical forms, elemental materials, the natural world, and the human spirit. At LINES Ballet, artistic investigation is infinite and essential for it leads to what unites us as human beings: empathy, joy, and the ability to transcend. Through LINES Ballet’s spring and fall home seasons at San Francisco’s Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, as well as global tours, the company shares Alonzo King’s singular vision of transformative, revelatory dance with 50,000+ audience members worldwide every year. LINES has been featured at venues such as the Venice Biennale, Monaco Dance Forum, Maison de la Dance de Lyon, the Edinburgh International Festival, Montpellier Danse, the Wolfsburg Festival, the Holland Dance Festival, and the Théâtre National de Chaillot in Paris.
