SAN FRANCISCO, CA (February 8, 2023)—The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) today announced the appointment of Sheila Shin as the museum’s Chief Experience Officer. A pivotal new role, the Chief Experience Officer will advance SFMOMA’s strategic priority to enhance its role as an inclusive, community-centered museum and will oversee the Brand Marketing, Communications, Digital Experience, Visitor Experience and Retail Operations teams, as well as the museum’s Food & Beverage program.

In this capacity, Shin will realize a leading-edge vision for audience engagement by driving new data-based approaches and insights via comprehensive marketing and digital engagement plans. This work will amplify explorations of SFMOMA’s collections, exhibitions and further participation and connection with the museum’s education and public engagement programs. An essential member of SFMOMA’s executive team, Shin will lead the museum in delivering meaningful experiences across every touchpoint along the visitor journey.

“During her tenure at SFMOMA, Sheila has been a strategic and innovative leader, bringing forward new ideas and approaches that advance our essential and ongoing work to make SFMOMA more welcoming and relevant to our growing and varied audiences. In recent months, she has guided the launch of SFMOMA’s new café, Steps Coffee, and our new ground floor restaurant, grace, and led artist- and illustrator-driven installations to reinvigorate our public spaces,” said Christopher Bedford, Helen and Charles Schwab Director of SFMOMA. “Through her collaborative work with SFMOMA’s exceptional team, she has driven critical growth, fostered a culture of trust and created memorable and exciting experiences for our community. I am confident that she will bring her singular vision to the newly established position of Chief Experience Officer, and I look forward to the many things we’ll accomplish together with the broader team for the benefit of our visitors.”
