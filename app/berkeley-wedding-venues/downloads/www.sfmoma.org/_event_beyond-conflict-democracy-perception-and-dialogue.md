Join us for an extraordinary conversation with**Sabina Cudic, Dr. Shady ElGhazaly Harb, Gabriela Ramos Patino, and David Koranyi** , four remarkable voices exploring the roots of conflict and the strategies we can use to bridge seemingly impossible divides, and introduced with a special performance by **Jeanette Andrews**.

Produced in collaboration with Beyond Conflict and California College of the Arts, this event brings together an artist who examines the power of shifting perception alongside leaders and diplomats whose work has navigated major conflicts and authoritarianism across the globe. Together, they will share examples and insights drawn from real experiences responding to democracy under pressure, navigating extreme polarization, and resisting the erosion of democratic systems. The conversation will also explore the vital role artists play in nurturing understanding and belonging.

At a moment when democracies worldwide face unprecedented challenges, these four practitioners offer understanding, grounded in hard-won experience, and practical insight to cultivate the skills the complexities of civic life require.

She invites audiences to co-create her illusory performances which function as live thought experiments. She has presented numerous commissioned works with the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, as well as for the Quebec City Biennial and Boca Raton Museum of Art, presented talks for Cooper Hewitt, Chicago Ideas Week, The British Society of Aesthetics, and universities, including Yale, Columbia, Princeton and Harvard.

### About Beyond Conflict

For 30 years, Beyond Conflict has created powerful and innovative frameworks to open pathways for progress in peace talks, transitions to democracy, and national reconciliation in the aftermath of division and violence in over 75 countries. Their powerful methodology of shared experience is grounded in two core principles: that people can learn from each other and that people can change. They have partnered with cognitive and behavioral scientists to bring forward a new framework at the intersection of behavioral sciences and real-world experience. Their goal is to apply brain science to design and promote new tools that reduce conflict, increase tolerance, and facilitate positive social change in the United States and abroad.
