What  
On Thursday, October 23, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) will present a video screening of _Eva Hesse: A Retrospective_. Filmed at SFMOMA during the Museum’s Eva Hesse retrospective in spring 2002, this 55-minute video takes viewers on a walking tour of the exhibition led by the Eva Hesse guest curator Elisabeth Sussman and UC Berkeley art history professor Anne Wagner. Commentary from Eva Hesse’s sister, Helen Charash, and observations by a range of scholars and conservators are also featured. A discussion with Sussman follows the screening. Thanks to the generosity of the film’s producer, SFMOMA will be distributing a number of copies of the Hesse DVD to university instructors, art history departments, and libraries at no cost.
