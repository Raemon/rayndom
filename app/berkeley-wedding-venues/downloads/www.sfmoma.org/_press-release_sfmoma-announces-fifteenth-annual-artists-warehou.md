The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) Artists Gallery will hold its annual Artists’ Warehouse Sale from Wednesday, May 7, through Sunday, May 11, 2008 at San Francisco’s Fort Mason Center, Building A. An annual tradition since 1993, the Artists’ Warehouse Sale is one of the Bay Area’s most anticipated art events. Popular with both new and seasoned collectors, the five-day sale features paintings, photographs, sculptures, prints, and works on paper at 50% off regular retail price. Sale proceeds benefit the programs of the SFMOMA Artists Gallery, which supports both the Museum and regional artists.

Held each spring, the sale includes **two special events that are free and open to the public.** On the first evening, the gallery hosts a reception featuring complimentary wine and live music. All works on view at the reception are available for purchase. On the final day, the gallery presents an afternoon of live jazz. Works are restocked daily, but visitors are encouraged to attend early for the best selection. Throughout the five-day sale, the gallery offers special extended hours: 

**OPENING NIGHT: Wednesday, May 7,** 6-9 p.m.

**SPECIAL SALE HOURS:**  
Thursday and Friday, 12–8 P.M.  
Saturday, 12–5:30 P.M.

Established in 1978, the SFMOMA Artists Gallery represents more than 700 emerging and established West Coast artists and mounts 8 exhibitions each year, including solo exhibitions, group and themed presentations, and occasional career retrospectives for mature artists. The gallery offers exposure and support to regional artists while providing seasoned collectors, corporate clients, and art-world newcomers alike an affordable way to enjoy original artwork.
