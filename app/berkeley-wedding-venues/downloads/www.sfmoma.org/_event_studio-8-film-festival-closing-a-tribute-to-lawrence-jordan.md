This event is presented in collaboration with the [Studio 8 Film Festival](https://www.sfartistsalumni.org/exhibitions-details/studio-8-film-festival-2025/r/recUiz16E3XMmL2rc). The filmmaker will be in attendance.

Join us for the closing event of the Studio 8 Film Festival — a tribute to legendary filmmaker **Lawrence Jordan**. This screening brings together a curated selection of Jordan’s visionary collage animations and surrealist shorts. The works, some rarely seen, span six decades and are rich with mythic resonance, surreal imagery, and a deeply poetic sense of motion and time.
