The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) will hold its biennial art auction on April 24, 2013, benefitting SFMOMA’s celebrated exhibitions and innovative education programs.

Organized by SFMOMA’s Modern Art Council, the museum’s premier fund-raising auxiliary, this signature event will feature more than 40 exceptional lots representing a range of work in all media by internationally distinguished artists, including **John Baldessari, Vija Celmins, Chuck Close, Rineke Dijkstra, Mark di Suvero, Andreas Gursky, Jasper Johns, Marilyn Minter, Martin Puryear, Gerhard Richter, Cindy Sherman, Katharina Sieverding, Kiki Smith, Andy Warhol, Garry Winogrand,** and **Christopher Wool.**

Led by auctioneer Patrick Meade from Bonhams Auctioneers & Appraisers, the evening will offer both live and silent auctions, as well as bountiful champagne, cocktails, gourmet food, and—new to the event this year—a live musical performance by Geographer, in addition to the opportunity for guests to utilize mobile bidding throughout the night. The event begins at 5 p.m. with a VIP preview reception; doors open for all ticket holders at 6 p.m.

“With many significant milestones ahead for SFMOMA—including a major [expansion project](/our_expansion) beginning this summer—this year’s auction promises to be an especially celebratory occasion,” says Event Chair and SFMOMA Trustee Alka Agrawal. “The museum has carefully assembled works by both established and emerging artists who have been featured in major exhibitions at the museum or who have produced works that are cornerstones of SFMOMA’s collection. This should be exciting bidding for collectors at all levels.”

Featured artworks will be on display at the museum prior to the auction on Saturday, April 20 and Sunday, April 21 from 11a.m. to 5 p.m in The Schwab Room. The auction preview is free and open to the public.

SFMOMA’s Art Auction 2013 is made possible through the generous support of presenting sponsor Northern California Porsche Dealers and supporting sponsors AT&T, Deloitte, and Webcor Builders. _San Francisco_ magazine is the media sponsor and Bonhams Auctioneers & Appraisers is the auction house sponsor. In-kind sponsorship is provided by Blueprint Studios, Champagne Ruinart, Hafner Vineyard, The Painters Place Picture Framers, and Ship Art International.

ART AUCTION 2013 HIGHLIGHTS

Among many highlights of the live auction will be **Andy Warhol’s _Still-Life (Hammer & Sickle) _**(1977), a stunning work on paper estimated at $60,000 to $90,000. Warhol revolutionized the art world with a slick, colorful, commodified interpretation, manifested in some of the most iconic works of the Pop art movement. This particular work was an apolitical exploration of diluted symbolism that used photographs of the titular tools as the starting point, executed against the backdrop of the Cold War.

Another anticipated highlight is **Gerhard Richter’s _Untitled (21.5.07)_**(2007), an oil-on-color-photograph estimated at $75,000 to $85,000. An undisputed modern master with an oeuvre uniquely his own, Richter moves among painting styles with astounding ease, creating stunning examples of photorealism as well as minimalistic abstractions.

**Jasper Johns’s** **_Periscope_**(1981), a color aquatint print estimated at $20,000 to $25,000, evokes familiar symbols, text, and iconography in a lush, abstract composition. A fixture in the pantheon of great American artists, Johns enjoys a rich and long-standing relationship with the Bay Area. SFMOMA’s major survey of his work last fall highlighted the symbiosis between his pioneering spirit and local audiences.

Certain to mesmerize viewers will be **Vija Celmins’s _Web Ladder, Divided Night Sky, Reverse Galaxy, Falling Stars,_** and** _Dark Galaxy_** (2010), a suite of four mezzotints and one etching with drypoint, estimated at $22,000 to $28,000. In these works she has laboriously crafted photorealistic portrayals of fleeting phenomena—the waves of an ocean, the delicate frames of spiderwebs, and the unreachable brilliance of the night sky. Currently SFMOMA has 17 works by Celmins in the collection.

Photography collectors will be thrilled with lots featuring artists included in the museum’s renowned photography collection, including German artist **Andreas Gursky’s _Gasherd (Gas Cooker)_**(1980), estimated at $35,000 to $45,000, which was the artist’s first published picture and still stands as a brilliant example of Gursky’s ability to elevate mundane subject matter with hypnotic ease.

**Cindy Sherman’s** _Untitled_(2010/12), a chromogenic color print photograph estimated at $50,000 to $70,000, is expected to be a crowd favorite. The subject of a retrospective at SFMOMA last year, Sherman has wowed viewers with inventive and alluring self-portraits for nearly four decades. Playing the role of photographer, model, costumer, and set decorator, she casts herself in a range of characters to highlight the mutable nature of identity.

Another highlight is **Garry Winogrand’s _Central Park Zoo, New_ York** (1967), estimated at $10,000 to $12,000. One of the most prolific photographers of the 20th century, Winogrand’s work is the subject of a comprehensive traveling retrospective currently on view at SFMOMA.

**Rineke Dijkstra’s** **_Sefton Park, Liverpool, June 10, 2006 B_** , (2006), estimated at $35,000 to $45,000, is an exceptional example of the artist’s _Park Portrait_ series, which links decidedly contemporary depictions to art historical compositions. The subject of a 2012 traveling retrospective co-organized by SFMOMA, the Dutch artist captivates viewers with large-scale portraits that simultaneously showcase vulnerability and power.

**Chuck Close’s _Self-Portrait (Yellow Raincoat_** _)_ (2013), a large-scale watercolor pigment print estimated at $75,000 to $95,000, beautifully captures the artist’s continuous exploration of both the portrait and self-portraiture. SFMOMA boasts a particularly rich concentration of Close’s works.
