Published in 2022

_Joan Brown_ charts the distinct and changing vision of a singular Bay Area artist. That vision, rooted firmly in research and impassioned curiosity, remains uniquely compelling today. Deeply embedded in the local art scene, Brown drew inspiration from many sources to create a charmingly offbeat body of work that merges autobiography, fantasy, and whimsy with weightier metaphysical and spiritual imagery and themes.

Featuring texts by curators Janet Bishop and Nancy Lim as well as essays by Solomon Adler, Marci Kwon, and Helen Molesworth, this lavishly illustrated book establishes Brown’s relationship to the self and family, to art history, and to her wider artistic community, while examining the unique materiality and personal imaging of her paintings. In addition, select Brown works are paired with commentaries by contemporary artists ranging from friends and peers, such as Ron Nagle, to younger artists inspired by her work, such as Woody De Othello.

Published in association with University of California Press on the occasion of the exhibition _Joan Brown,_ organized by Janet Bishop and Nancy Lim for the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (November 19, 2022–March 12, 2023)

ISBN 9780520391963 (hardcover)
