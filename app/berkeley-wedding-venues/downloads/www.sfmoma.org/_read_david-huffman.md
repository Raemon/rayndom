### About

Basketball was central to David Huffman’s youth. Year-round, he would play from morning until night fell and the court went dark. For him, the basketball court was a sanctuary, an experience the artist describes as shared by many Black Americans. _Portals_ does not represent Huffman’s childhood court literally. Instead, the enveloping background and three individual paintings (_Andromeda_ , _Moon_ , and _Bridge_) create a magical setting of wonder and peace. The backboards are portals leading to trees, green hills, and an unearthly light conveyed with saturated colors. The outdoor court becomes a gateway from urban space into the beauty of nature and beyond. _Portals_ draws together imagination and reality, the city and the natural world to capture basketball as it embodies the spirit of a place.
