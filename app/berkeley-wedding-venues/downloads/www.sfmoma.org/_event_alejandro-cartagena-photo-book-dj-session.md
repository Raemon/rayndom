Join us for a unique “photobook DJ” performance with artist **Alejandro Cartagena** to explore the books that have shaped how he thinks about photography and the book form.

Rooted in his practice as a photographer, archivist, and collector, Cartagena’s work often involves gathering and organizing images within specific conceptual frameworks. Meaning emerges through repetition, juxtaposition, and subtle variation. In this performance, he brings that same methodology to life, curating books in real time under an overhead camera, with the pages projected at large scale.

As Cartagena layers images and texts, and adds and removes books from view, connections and tensions begin to surface. The audience is invited to engage in this evolving process of interpretation and observe how systems of meaning form, shift, or unravel.

The performance is accompanied by recorded videos of books being flipped through, ambient music, and a reading from Susan Sontag to create a layered and contemplative atmosphere.

Pop in early for an interactive experience drawing from Cartagena’s work. Designed and developed by Hugues Bruyère in collaboration with Cartagena, this experience uses The Latent Space, an AI model trained on the artist’s photographs of homes and the city to explore representational bias in training datasets.
