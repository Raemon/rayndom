# Target Your Gift

### Exhibition Support

SFMOMA presents more than twenty special exhibitions every year, ranging from comprehensive retrospectives focused on a single artist to surveys of a movement or theme, as well as our cutting-edge _New Work_ series. These exhibitions can take years to develop, requiring extensive scholarship by museum curators, partnerships with other museums, and cooperation from artists and collectors.

Your gift in support of SFMOMA’s exhibitions provides funds for these groundbreaking, innovative projects.

### Education Support

SFMOMA’s team of educators is dedicated to creating meaningful cultural programming for the museum’s diverse audiences. SFMOMA School Initiatives support students and teachers in the Bay Area by encouraging students to look, discover, question, and explore like artists do. For adults, continuing education programs let you explore and develop your connection to contemporary and modern art. Free gallery talks, daily tours, and weekly curator discussions provide even more ways for the community to engage with the museum.

Your gift in support of SFMOMA’s education programs ensures that all visitors have an engaging, illuminating experience whenever they visit.

### Other Ways to Target Your Gift

From the many ways we connect with the community to the care of our collections, your support plays a vital role in the museum’s bright future. In addition to exhibitions and education programs, supporters can target their gifts to benefit conservation, digital engagement, community outreach, and many other programs.
