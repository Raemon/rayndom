Archival investigation and activation are often key ingredients in the practice of polymathic San Francisco artist **Lindsey White**. Across individual artworks and overall exhibition strategies, she has engaged literally and emotionally with various archives, including the American Museum of Magic, San Francisco Art Institute Legacy Foundation + Archive (SFAI LF+A), Rhoda Kellogg Children’s Art Collection, Manitoba Museum of Finds Art, and the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.

In this illustrated lecture, White discusses the importance of affording archival access to artists, upending traditional exhibition formats in fresh and uncanny ways, and the mining of under-known histories as a way to chart the future. She also focuses on a recent project, **_Last Art School_** , an exhibition and program series she organized at Hunter College that investigated the current crisis moment within higher arts education. The project included archival materials to reflect on how creative communities can collaborate, resist, and take action in unstable political and economic moments.

After the talk, and in the spirit of fellowship that animates much of her work, White presents **Big Sandwich, a thirty-foot sub to be enjoyed by the community**. As a professor at SFAI, and with the help of students, she hosted Big Sandwich for nine years in the grassy meadow outside the photography department. Vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free segments are available.
