**About the Artist**

William T. Wiley has challenged precepts of mainstream art for the last fifty years with works in media ranging from drawing, painting, and sculpture to film and performance. Difficult to classify as part of any movement or style, his is an art of engagement and confrontation, challenging our views on any number of universal topics, including art, love, war, and the natural environment. Wiley’s multivalent pieces use both familiar imagery and a personal vocabulary of symbols to communicate his ideas. Complex and elusive, Wiley’s remarkable works consistently encourage us to consider human nature and contemporary society in a new light.
