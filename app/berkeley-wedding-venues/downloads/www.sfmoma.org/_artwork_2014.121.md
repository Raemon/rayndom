_SFX: Fade in wind blowing, arid soundscape, distant coyote. Bells._

NARRATOR:

Take a look at that figure, standing with her back to us. She’s the artist: Dorothea Tanning. She created this painting in her studio in New York, after spending a year in Arizona. She painted it from memory, using no reference images on purpose. 

TANNING: 

Red rock country is what it’s called. All these fantastic red shapes. And it’s beautiful to see, but if you’re painting, you just can’t paint that red. It’s overwhelming.

A very nice thing happens when people see you in a remote place like that. We are not the same people as when we see each other in New York parties, when everything is very tense, and even a little superficial. When you see each other in a place like Sedona, Arizona, all those fronts and those veils are down, and you speak to each other in a very true and natural way.

_SFX: Fade out arid landscape_
