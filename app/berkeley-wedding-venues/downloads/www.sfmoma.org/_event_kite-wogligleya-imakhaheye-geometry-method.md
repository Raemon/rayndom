Experience _Wógligleya/Imákȟaheye_ (Geometry/Method), **a collaborative performance by multimedia artist and composer Kite with student musicians** based in the Bay Area. The ensemble will compose a graphic music score, translating their personal dreams and experiences into experimental notation derived from dream symbolism and Lakȟóta visual language, a geometric lexicon traditionally used in Lakȟóta women’s quillwork. Using a custom machine learning interface developed by Kite, the artist will perform alongside the group of student musicians playing a diverse range of instruments, together interpreting and improvising their collectively composed score. Drawing upon Indigenous knowledge systems and semiotics, this dynamic performance brings together sound, movement, and kindred collaborations between humans and machines, inviting audiences to consider new ways of listening and knowing the world around us.
