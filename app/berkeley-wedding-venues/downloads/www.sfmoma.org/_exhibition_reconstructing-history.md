_(Re)Constructing History_ embraces the possibility for photographs to both record an instant and capture the history embedded within the present. Borrowing its title from artist Carrie Mae Weems’s featured series, _Constructing History,_ this installation invites audiences to imagine the layers of history we encounter through a seemingly fixed image. 

Across three galleries, photographs explore complicated, painful, and familiar histories. The first gallery examines Wall Street as a symbol of American power through its historic and modern depictions, while the second features artists who rework visual traditions through reference and appropriation. The final gallery considers how photography is uniquely positioned to expose the hidden forces behind changing environments and landmark formation. 

In addition to Weems, this presentation celebrates contemporary Black artists Nona Faustine, Carla Williams, and Dawoud Bey as anchors in each respective gallery. These artists create works that move beyond static, silent documents, offering imaginative images that reveal stories of Black life previously unseen or unconsidered.
