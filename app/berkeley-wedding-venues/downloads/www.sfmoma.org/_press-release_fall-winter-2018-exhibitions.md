SAN FRANCISCO, CA (June 28, 2018) — The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) today announced its compelling schedule of exhibitions opening at the museum this fall and winter. SFMOMA will present the global debut of the retrospective **_[Vija Celmins: To Fix the Image in Memory](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/vija-celmins/)_** (December 15, 2018–March 31, 2019) — the artist’s first major retrospective in more than 25 years. The full range of her subtle, exquisitely detailed paintings, drawings and sculptures will be on display in the museum’s special exhibition galleries. The exclusive West Coast presentation of the contemporary survey **_[Art and China after 1989: Theater of the World](https://www.sfmoma.org/press/release/art-and-china-after-1989/)_** (November 10, 2018–February 24, 2019) will transform the museum’s entire seventh floor. This exhibition will present works that anticipated, chronicled and agitated for the sweeping social transformation that placed China at the center of the conversation on globalization. 

SFMOMA’s Pritzker Center for Photography, the largest space dedicated to photography in any art museum in the United States, will offer temporary exhibitions highlighting the careers of Brassaï and Louis Stettner, who became friends in Paris in the 1940s. Bringing together outstanding prints along with many never-before-seen photographs, **_[Brassaï](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/brassai/)_** (November 17, 2018–February 18, 2019) will focus on the French artist’s celebrated depictions of 1930s Paris. From thoughtful images of rush-hour commuters to tranquil observations of daily routines, the thematic retrospective **_[Louis Stettner: Traveling Light](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/louis-stettner/)_** (October 27, 2018–May 27, 2019) will showcase the remarkable breadth of the American photographer’s work. In the Pritzker Center’s _New to the Collection_ gallery, **_[Johannes Brus](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/johannes-brus/)_** (October 27, 2018–May 27, 2019) will introduce a recent acquisition of the German artist’s photographic experiments from the 1970s in his first U.S. solo presentation.

California—in particular Northern California—art and artists will also be highlighted throughout the museum this fall and winter. In the single-gallery presentation **_[New Work: Etel Adnan](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/new-work-etel-adnan/)_** (September 1, 2018–January 6, 2019), new paintings by writer and artist Etel Adnan, who lived in the Bay Area for over 50 years, will be juxtaposed with tapestries from the 1960s to today. **_[The Sea Ranch: Architecture, Environment, and Idealism](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/sea-ranch/) _**(December 22, 2018–April 28, 2019) will explore the Northern California coast’s Modernist beacon through original sketches, archival images, photographs of The Sea Ranch today and a full-scale architectural replica. In two side-by-side exhibitions, Northern California–based artist Wayne Thiebaud’s own work will be featured in **_[Wayne Thiebaud: Paintings and Drawings](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/wayne-thiebaud-artists-choice/)_** (September 29, 2018–April 28, 2019) alongside paintings by others that he personally selected from SFMOMA’s collection in **_[Wayne Thiebaud: Artist’s Choice](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/wayne-thiebaud-artists-choice/)_** (September 29, 2018–March 10, 2019). 

In addition to SFMOMA’s fall exhibition programming, the museum will honor **[Kara Walker](https://www.sfmoma.org/artist/Kara_Walker)** with the annual **[Contemporary Vision Award](https://www.sfmoma.org/event/2018-cva-kara-walker/)** on Wednesday, October 3, 2018. The event celebrating the artistic accomplishments of Walker—best known for her candid investigation of race, gender, sexuality and violence through silhouetted figures—supports the museum’s groundbreaking exhibitions and education programs.
