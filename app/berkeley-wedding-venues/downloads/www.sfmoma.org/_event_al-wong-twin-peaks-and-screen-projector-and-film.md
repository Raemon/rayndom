An SFAI alum and educator, Al Wong has explored the bounds of the moving image across his career — experimenting with form, technique, and process — and the nature of the viewing experience. This screening will present Wong’s rarely seen 16mm expanded cinema work _Screen, Projector and Film_ (1977), which foregrounds the nature of viewing and transitions the experience into the work’s primary concern. This piece is paired with a theatrical screening of Wong’s _[Twin Peaks](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/al-wong-twin-peaks/)_ (1977), currently on view in SFMOMA’s Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Atrium. _Twin Peaks_ traces a slow drive around the San Francisco landmark at different times of day over the course of a year. The screenings will be followed by a conversation between Wong and Brett Kashmere, executive director of Canyon Cinema.

**_Screen, Projector and Film_** (1977, 14 min., color, silent, 16mm)  
**_Twin Peaks_** (1977, 50 min., color, sound, digital)
