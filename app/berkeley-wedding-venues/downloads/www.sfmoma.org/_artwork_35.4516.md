_SFX: agricultural soundscape: soft wind in leaves and grass, the clipping of flowers_

RUPERT GARCIA: 

I mean, this is kind of an idealized rendition of something Mexican.

NARRATOR: 

Artist Rupert Garcia — 

GARCIA: It’s based upon life of Mexico, but it’s been romanticized by Diego Rivera…The light, how it resonates off of the flowers and straw hats and these earth tones. 

  
 _SFX: Strumming of guitar, sentimental_

NARRATOR: 

Diego Rivera was _defined_ by his love of Mexico. Even though he was a world-famous artist, he identified most with common workers and peasant farmers, like this bent-over _campesino._ Most days he could be found in a pair of overalls and a beaten-up hat.

AMALIA MESA-BAINS: 

So he would go out in the truck in the morning 

NARRATOR: 

Artist Amalia Mesa-Bains–

MESA-BAINS: 

and he would do tons of these sketches of the people in the fields working or the flower vendors, 

NARRATOR: 

You know how we can’t see the faces of these two characters very well? That was kind of the point. Rivera wasn’t painting a specific person, he was celebrating a way of life. 

GARCIA: 

I think it’s about the dignity of being a flower carrier, or a flower vendor.

_SFX: Guitar fades_
