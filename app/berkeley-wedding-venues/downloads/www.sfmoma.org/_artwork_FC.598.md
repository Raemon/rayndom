_Music:__Bach’s fugue in C-sharp minor (or similar)_

_SFX: Paul Celan reads first few lines of Todesfuge, in German._

NARRATOR: 

German artist Anselm Keifer makes work that openly grapples with the guilt and horror of his country’s history. He made this painting, “Sulamith” – and the one nearby, _Margarthe_ — in response to a poem about the Holocaust. The poem is called “Death Fugue,” by the Jewish poet Paul Celan. 

MALE VOICE:

Black milk of daybreak we drink you at night

we drink you at morning and midday we drink you at evening

we drink and we drink

A man lives in the house 

he plays with his vipers 

he writes

he writes when it grows dark to Deutschland your golden hair Margeurite

your ashen hair Shulamith 

we shovel a grave in the air there you won’t lie too cramped

He shouts jab this earth deeper you lot there you others sing up and play

he grabs for the rod in his belt he swings it his eyes are blue

jab your spades deeper you lot there 

you others 

play on for the dancing … . 

Black milk of daybreak we drink you at night

we drink you at midday and morning we drink you at evening

we drink and we drink

a man lives in the house your goldenes Haar Margeurite

your aschenes Haar Shulamith he plays with his vipers

He shouts play death more sweetly Death is a master from Deutschland

he shouts scrape your strings darker you’ll rise then in smoke to the sky

you’ll have a grave then in the clouds there you won’t lie too cramped

_Music: fades_
