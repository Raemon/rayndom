# Weddings at SFMOMA

Sweeping views over the city’s skyline towers. The verdant green of a 4,400-square-foot Living Wall. Galleries filled with masterpieces of modern and contemporary art. There’s no place more romantic and meaningful than SFMOMA to have a truly unforgettable day.

  * Start time for evening events is 6:30pm. This may vary depending on the set-up requirements. The maximum capacity for receptions is 150 guests.
  * SFMOMA has an Approved Caterers list that we require our clients to choose from. This list is comprised of caterers who have an established relationship with SFMOMA, are insured to work within our spaces, and certified with our required policies.
  * A wedding coordinator is required for the day of the wedding. List of preferred planners available upon request.
  * Rental fees include museum guards, engineers, some janitorial and a museum liaison. Gallery rental, furniture rentals and catering are not included.
  * Hosting private events at SFMOMA is an exclusive perk of [Curators’ Circle Members](https://www.sfmoma.org/membership/curators-circle/) at the “Enthusiast” level. This also doubles as an amazing gift to our newlywed clients who can enjoy the museum for their first year together.
