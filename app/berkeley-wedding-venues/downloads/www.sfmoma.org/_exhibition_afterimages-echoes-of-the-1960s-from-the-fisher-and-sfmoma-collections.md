_Afterimages: Echoes of the 1960s from the Fisher and SFMOMA Collections_ examines how the cultural currents and consciousness-shifting artistic movements of the 1960s continue to be relevant today. Marked equally by hope and loss, the decade ushered in a transformative period of rapid social, political, and technological change. Artists associated with Pop art dissolved the division between “high” and “low” culture by incorporating media imagery and new modes of commercial production into their work. In the same period, artists engaging with conceptual and minimal strategies transformed industrial materials and serially repeated forms to question social structures and methods of artistic production. This intergenerational exhibition reflects on how these pioneering artistic developments have remained active, driving forces in contemporary art and culture. Organized as a series of thematic galleries, the presentation features works by Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Kerry James Marshall, Jenny Holzer, and Andy Warhol and highlights new acquisitions by artists such as Virginia Jaramillo, William T. Williams, and Charlotte Posenenske.”
