_Of Whales_ (2022) is derived from Wu Tsang’s multidisciplinary research around Herman Melville’s novel _Moby Dick_ ; or, _The Whale_ (1851). Tracing the diving path of a sperm whale who plunges down to non-human depths for over an hour at a time only to resurface for a brief breath of air, _Of Whales_ is a mystical adventure in place and being. Created on the Unity gaming platform, the dynamically generated real-time video and sound installation envelops visitors in an oceanscape-cosmos for respite, contemplation, and provocation. _Of Whales_ forms part of a filmic trilogy that includes Tsang’s feature-length adaptation of _Moby Dick_ , which reinterprets the novel through a postcolonial lens, channeling the perspectives of the whale and crew to evoke latent spiritual musings and queer intimacies. First presented at the 59th Venice Biennale in 2022, the work features a musical score composed by Asma Maroof and Daniel Pineda, with Tapiwa Svosve, Jalalu-Kalvert Nelson, and Miao Zhao.
