# About the Library

Ever since SFMOMA opened in 1935, the Library has been dedicated to advancing scholarship in modern and contemporary art. In other words, we’re here to help you learn. Our holdings reflect art movements, organizations, historians, critics, and makers of modern and contemporary art, as well as SFMOMA’s collections, exhibitions, and programming.

We’re open to researchers interested in learning about modern and contemporary art, including students, artists, teachers, professors, authors, dealers, collectors, and museum colleagues.

The Library is open to the public by [appointment](http://www.sfmoma.org/library-archives/about-library/library-appointment-request-form/).
