Frida Kahlo was born in Mexico in 1907. She loved to draw when she was a child. When Kahlo was 18, she was in a bus accident and had to stay in bed for months to recover. While she was in bed healing, she made paintings about what she felt and saw, including many **self-portraits** —paintings of herself. When Kahlo was better, she showed her paintings to the famous Mexican artist Diego Rivera, who encouraged her to become an artist, and who later became her husband.
