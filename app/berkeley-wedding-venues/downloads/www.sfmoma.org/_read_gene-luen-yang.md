### About

Comics artist and writer Gene Luen Yang’s mural features the stories of three athletes from local basketball teams — Stephen Curry, Jeremy Lin, and Fran Belibi — and links them to three aspects of the game: the three-point shot, the pick and roll, and the slam dunk. Yang is the creator of _Dragon Hoops_ , the acclaimed nonfiction graphic novel centered on the varsity boys’ basketball team at Oakland’s Bishop O’Dowd High School and their triumphant 2014–15 season. Celebrated for his formal innovation and intricate storytelling, Yang believes that comics can illuminate everything from difficult histories to individual identities.
