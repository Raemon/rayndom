Accepted in the Olympic Games while prohibited in most public spaces, skateboarding’s role in sport and our society is nascent and evolving in comparison to organized sports. Yet the impact of skate culture transcends the act of skateboarding itself. Join author and skateboarder José Vadi for a multimedia presentation on how skateboarding — the act and its culture — creates a new lens that redefines our relationships with the built environment and contributes to new narratives. He’ll invite you to see recognizable Bay Area locations across time, observing both the ways they have changed and the innate understanding skaters have of civic landscapes. 

As part of the program series [Pick Up Games](https://www.sfmoma.org/event/pick-up-games/), a live reading by Vadi within the _Get in the Game_ exhibition will follow the presentation.

#### About the Speaker

José Vadi is an award-winning essayist, poet, playwright, and film producer. He is the author of _Inter State: Essays from California_ and _Chipped: Writing from a Skateboarder’s Lens_. His work has been featured by the _Paris Review, The Atlantic, PBS NewsHour_ , KQED, _Free Skate Magazine, Quartersnacks, Alta Journal_ , and the _Yale Review_.
