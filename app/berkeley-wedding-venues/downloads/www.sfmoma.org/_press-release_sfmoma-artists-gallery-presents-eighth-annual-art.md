The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) Artists Gallery, formerly known as the Rental Gallery, presents its eighth annual Artists Warehouse Sale from May 9 to 13, 2001, at Fort Mason Center, Building A. One of the year’s most anticipated art sales and annual fund-raisers, the benefit sale includes works by more than 300 West Coast artists, including Jamie Brunson, Willard Dixon, Mike Henderson and Kenji Nano. All artworks will be offered at 50 percent off the normal retail price.

Proceeds from the Artists Warehouse Sale support the SFMOMA Artists Gallery’s exhibition program, which promotes regional art, SFMOMA and the artists themselves. The sale begins with a grand opening reception on Wednesday, May 9 from 5 to 9 p.m. that features refreshments and live music by the Creole Bells. During the sale, the gallery will offer special extended hours:

> **Wednesday, May 9 5–9 p.m. (opening and reception)  
>  Thursday, May 10 12–8 p.m.  
>    
>  Friday, May 11 12–8 p.m.  
>    
>  Saturday, May 12 12–5:30 p.m.  
>  Sunday, May 13 2–4 p.m.**

Although the gallery restocks sale works daily, visitors are encouraged to attend early for the best selection.

Established in 1978, the SFMOMA Artists Gallery provides exposure and support to West Coast artists. Now representing over 1,200 artists, the gallery serves a broad range of corporate and individual patrons through its art rental and sales operations. The SFMOMA Artists Gallery mounts approximately 10 exhibitions per year showcasing Bay Area contemporary artists working in all media.
