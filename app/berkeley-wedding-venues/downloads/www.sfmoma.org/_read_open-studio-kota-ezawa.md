Auguste Rodin's _The Burghers of Calais_

#### Preparation

Your class will divide into groups of 8–10 students. Within each group, 6 of the students will be performers and the rest will be cameramen/women or directors.

  * With your group, study photos of Auguste Rodin’s _The Burghers of Calais_. These photos can easily be found on the Internet or in books about Rodin’s work.
  * Next, select a site for your group’s version of the Rodin sculpture, such as the courtyard of your school or another place suitable for public art.
  * With guidance from the directors, the six performers will reenact the poses of the figures in Rodin’s sculpture, while the camera operators situate the camera in a way that captures the scene created by the actors. (Costumes are not necessary.)



#### Recording

  * Recording begins once the performers and camera are in place, and continues for 5 minutes. The performers hold their pose for an additional 5 seconds after the director gives a signal to stop recording, and then conclude their performance.
  * Try transferring the recording to a looping DVD. This can be accomplished with DVD Studio Pro. 



#### Exhibition

  * The DVD or videotape is played back on a TV or video monitor.
  * Depending on the number of groups in the class, 2 to 3 Rodin video sculptures are shown simultaneously on 2 to 3 monitors/TVs.
  * The TVs and monitors should be set up in the school courtyard if weather permits, or moved to another public area of the school.
