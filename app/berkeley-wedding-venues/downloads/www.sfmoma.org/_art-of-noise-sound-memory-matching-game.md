# Art of Noise Sound Memory Matching Game

Are you ready to listen closely and match swiftly? Below is an auditory memory game featuring sound objects from the [_Art of Noise_](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/art-of-noise/) exhibition. This is a race against the clock to match all the pairs! There are three modes in the game: 

  1. **Audio Mode:** Rely solely on sound to find the pairs. Matching a sound reveals the corresponding object. But be careful—you only get ten incorrect matches before it’s game over!
  2. **Audio + Visual Mode:** As each sound plays, its object image is also revealed. While this mode provides more clues, you have less time and fewer attempts to match the pairs.
  3. **Exploration Mode:** Freely explore each object and listen to its sounds at your leisure.

Can you match all the pairs before time runs out? Let the art of noise guide you to victory!
