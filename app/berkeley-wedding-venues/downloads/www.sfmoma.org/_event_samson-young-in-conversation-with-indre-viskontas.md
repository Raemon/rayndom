Explore the intersection of memory, music, and artificial intelligence in this conversation between artist **Samson Young** and neuroscientist **Indre Viskontas**. Using Young’s current exhibition at SFMOMA as a point of departure, they will explore how memories are formed and recalled by the brain, and how AI can mimic or alter this process, particularly in the realm of music composition. They will examine the differences between human and AI-generated music, and how our understanding of memory influences how we experience and react to these creations. The conversation will also delve into the qualities of memory that are hard to articulate, such as love and personal connections, and how music can serve as a bridge through time.
