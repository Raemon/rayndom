For more than sixty years, Jasper Johns has found new ways to explore how art creates meaning in the mind’s eye. His most celebrated paintings from the 1950s and 1960s, with their bold colors, popular imagery, and sculptural elements, had an enormous impact on the development of Pop art, Minimalism, and Conceptual art. Johns is undoubtedly one of the most significant artists of the twentieth century, and his work has inspired some of the field’s most incisive critical thinking and writing. 

_Jasper Johns: Seeing with the Mind’s Eye_ brings together writings by established and younger scholars with the aim of exposing a new generation to the variety of approaches to this contemporary master. Contributions range from historical to critical and poetic. Unlike most large surveys, this eloquent, accessible volume takes a close, in-depth look at specific works of art and series, including paintings, drawings, graphics, sculptural pieces, and illustrated books from all periods of Johns’s career.

Published in association with Yale University Press on the occasion of the exhibition _Jasper Johns: Seeing with the Mind’s Eye,_ held at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (November 3, 2012–February 3, 2013)
