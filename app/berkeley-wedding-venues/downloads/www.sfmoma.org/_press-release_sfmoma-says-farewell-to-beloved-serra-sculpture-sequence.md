### What:

Visit the beloved Richard Serra sculpture _Sequence_ before its deinstallation begins December 26. Generously loaned by the Donald and Doris Fisher Family and installed as the first artwork in SFMOMA’s 2016 Snøhetta-designed expansion, Sequence will be reinstalled at the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford University. Beginning January 2, please enter SFMOMA at 151 Third Street, as our entrance at Howard Street will be closed.

### Why:

SFMOMA’s free Roberts Family Gallery is a space for rotating contemporary artworks. The time has come to say goodbye to Sequence and welcome something new. Next, the museum will install French artist JR’s massive video mural, [_The Chronicles of San Francisco_](https://www.sfmoma.org/press/release/jr-installation/), opening to the public May 23.

### When:

The last day to walk through _Sequence_ at SFMOMA is _**December 24**_.

Holiday hours: Open December 24 and December 31, 2018, 10 a.m.–4 p.m.; open Wednesday, December 26, 2018 and Wednesday, January 2, 2019, 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; closed December 25, 2018.

### Scheduling Note for Assignment Editors:

We can accommodate media interviews and onsite shoots of the work, given at least 24 hours advance notice, until December 20. After that point, we welcome self-guided media walk-throughs with handheld photography and videography only.

### Where:

SFMOMA’s ground-floor Roberts Family Gallery
