# Supporter: KAWS Edition Memberships — Frequently Asked Questions

###  What is the Supporter: KAWS Edition membership? 

Expand details

A special version of our $300 Supporter membership created in celebration of [_KAWS: FAMILY_](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/kaws-family/). It includes all standard Supporter benefits plus a complimentary KAWS figure and special-edition membership cards. This membership is available in limited quantities and offered while supplies last. 

###  How is it different from the standard Supporter membership? 

Expand details

Both options include the full set of Supporter benefits (free museum admission for you and up to three guests, Member Preview access, Museum Store discount, [free admission at over forty art museums](https://www.sfmoma.org/membership/reciprocal-benefits/) throughout North America, and more). The key difference is that KAWS Edition adds a complimentary KAWS figure and special card and, because of that figure, this version of the Supporter membership is not tax deductible. (The standard Supporter membership remains fully tax deductible.)

###  Who can purchase the Supporter: KAWS Edition membership? 

Expand details

The Supporter: KAWS Edition membership is a special, limited-availability membership connected to _KAWS: FAMILY_ , offering a unique way for new members to experience SFMOMA. This membership is open to individuals who haven’t held an active membership since April 1, 2025. While it isn’t available as a renewal or gift membership, current members can continue to enjoy all the benefits of their existing membership and other special experiences throughout the year.

###  What benefits are included? 

Expand details

You’ll receive the full Supporter benefits (unlimited admission for you + up to three guests, Member Preview access, and a 10% Museum Store discount with eligibility for member sale days, [free admission at over forty art museums](https://www.sfmoma.org/membership/reciprocal-benefits/) throughout North America), plus a complimentary KAWS figure and special-edition membership cards.

###  How long does my membership last? 

Expand details

Your membership begins as soon as you join and remains active for one full year. It will expire on the last day of the same month the following year. (For example, if you join on October 20, 2025, your membership will be valid through October 31, 2026.)

###  Is the Supporter: KAWS Edition membership tax deductible? 

Expand details

No. Because the membership includes a KAWS figure with fair-market value, it is not tax deductible. The standard Supporter membership is fully tax deductible.
