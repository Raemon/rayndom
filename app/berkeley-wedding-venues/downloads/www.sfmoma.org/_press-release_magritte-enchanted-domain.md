**_René Magritte: The Fifth Season_**

**May 19–October 28, 2018**

SAN FRANCISCO, CA (May 15, 2018) — _René Magritte: The Fifth Season_ — presented exclusively at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) from May 19 through October 28, 2018 — focuses on the latter half of Magritte’s career, from approximately 1943 to 1967, a period of remarkable transformation and revitalization for the artist. With loans from North and South America, Europe and Asia, it is the most complete presentation of Magritte’s late work mounted since the artist’s death in 1967. Including more than 20 artworks being shown for the first time in a U.S. museum, and the first concentrated examination of Magritte’s sunlit surrealism and gouaches in this country, _René Magritte: The Fifth Season_ marks a major milestone in the artist’s exhibition history.

### _Enchanted Domain_ and _Dominion of Light_ Presentations

A key highlight of the exclusive SFMOMA presentation is a collection of five rarely seen canvases from _The Enchanted Domain_ (1953), Magritte’s monumental 360-degree panorama and his largest work. The mural, 236 feet in circumference, was commissioned for a circular room in the Grand Casino in Knokke, Belgium. Magritte created eight oil paintings that established the design of the frieze on a 1:6 scale. With five paintings displayed continuously around a curved gallery wall, SFMOMA’s presentation is the first time in 40 years that this many of _The Enchanted Domain_ works have been seen together in a museum exhibition.

Adjacent to _The Enchanted Domain_ is an astounding selection of works entitled _The Dominion of Light_. Depicting nighttime landscapes with broad daylight skyscapes, the works in this series show day and night co-existing seamlessly in a scene that Magritte portrayed more than 20 times during his career. Until now, no more than three of these paintings have been exhibited together. This exhibition offers the first opportunity to experience the series simultaneously, in a fully immersive gallery with seven unique depictions, including two monumental canvases that have never previously left Europe.

### Magritte Interpretive Gallery  


A longtime leader in using digital content to engage audiences, SFMOMA embraces opportunities to experiment with creative approaches to museum education. Building on a legacy of unique interpretation that appeals to a wide range of learners and visitors, SFMOMA presents the Magritte Interpretive Gallery, in partnership with global design and strategy firm [frog](https://www.frogdesign.com/).

This gallery at the conclusion of _René Magritte: The Fifth Season_ invites audiences to enter and experience Magritte’s worlds and philosophies through six augmented reality interactions. Utilizing advanced depth-sensing cameras and motion-tracking technology to create an immersive environment, SFMOMA and frog enable visitors to investigate Magritte’s themes through a series of altered and augmented windows. In some, the windows function as digital mirrors in which the viewers’ reflections do not behave as expected. In others, the visitors’ presence in front of the window opens a portal into another reality. Looking past the two-dimensional plane, the Magritte Interpretive Gallery adds a third dimension in which human perception may be manipulated through motion, altered visuals and 3D software. The result is an experience that complements the exhibition, in which visitors can gain a deeper understanding of Magritte’s art, and explore visual perceptions of the world and each another.

### Magritte Audio Guide  


For _René Magritte: The Fifth Season_ , SFMOMA’s Interpretive Media team has created a new audio guide available for both iPhone and Android users. Unconventional and impressionistic, the tour features conversational musings and insights from Caitlin Haskell and Gary Garrels, Elise S. Haas Senior Curator of Painting and Sculpture at SFMOMA, as well as artists Vija Celmins and Jeff Koons, and writer and personal friend of Magritte, Suzi Gablik. Devices will be available for rental, or visitors can download the experience at [sfmoma.org/app](https://www.sfmoma.org/app). 

### Organization  


_René Magritte: The Fifth Season_ , which follows the 50th anniversary of Magritte’s death, builds on SFMOMA’s longstanding relationship with the Magritte Museum in Brussels, Belgium. Curated by Caitlin Haskell, associate curator of painting and sculpture at SFMOMA, it was developed in partnership with the Magritte Foundation.
