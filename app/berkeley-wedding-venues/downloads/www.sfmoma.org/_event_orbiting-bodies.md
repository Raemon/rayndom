_Orbiting Bodies_ examines affinities shared in the work of SFAI alumni artists spanning the decades. Bodies in orbit can be those of the SFAI community flowing together, the stationary orbit of one’s partner in front of the camera, or a child’s repetitive revolutions around a parent as they both age. Other times these bodies are planetary, keeping ancient celestial time. Threaded through the projector in inventive ways, film can even diverge from its usual path and orbit itself. The work and community of SFAI artists orbit one another across the years. These films investigate our perception of time, sometimes in collaboration with composers of music, another time-based medium. This program, the second screening in a two-part series curated by Steve Anker and Mark Wilson, includes films made between the 1970s and 2000s by alumni and allied institute figures at SFAI or later in their careers.

Part one of this program, [Personal Voices](https://www.sfmoma.org/event/personal-voices/), is at 1 p.m.
