Join us for an immersive exploration of the history, styles, and culture of Bay Area graffiti and street art at this interactive workshop with rapper, graffiti artist, podcaster, and educator **Dregs One**. 

As creator of the _History of the Bay_ podcast, Dregs One has collaborated extensively with artists across the region, tracing decades of the Bay Area’s graffiti and street art scene. In this workshop, he’ll provide a comprehensive overview of graffiti while spotlighting what makes the Bay Area’s scene distinctive. After introducing specific styles, he’ll invite attendees to try their hand at the creative process. 

In the second half, Dregs will be joined by [Ruby Neri](https://www.davidkordanskygallery.com/artist/ruby-neri) to discuss their creative journey and examine how graffiti and street art — often dismissed as illegitimate — have gained recognition in art history and institutional spaces like museums. 

This program concludes a series of events presented by Dregs One celebrating a newly commissioned mural at 715 Harrison Street. The mural debuts Wednesday, February 4, with an on-site celebration, followed by a festival at Public Works on Friday, February 6.
