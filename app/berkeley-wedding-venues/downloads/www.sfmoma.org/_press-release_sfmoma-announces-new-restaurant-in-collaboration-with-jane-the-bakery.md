SAN FRANCISCO, CA (July 23, 2025)—In a meeting of two local creative forces, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) and Jane the Bakery announce a new restaurant for the museum’s ground floor, Jane on Third, launching in August 2025. To celebrate the restaurant’s opening, the museum has commissioned local artist Chelsea Ryoko Wong to create a new site-specific mural for the space.

Jane is a San Francisco bakery and café brand, originally founded by Amanda Michael in February 2011. Driven by her deep passion for food and hospitality, Michael opened the first Jane location on Fillmore Street and has since established a popular presence throughout the Bay Area, including Jane on Larkin, Jane the Bakery on Geary Boulevard and Toy Boat by Jane. Jane also acquired the legendary Sweet Things bakery with locations in Tiburon and in San Francisco’s CalMart. Jane on Third will be the bakery’s seventh outpost.

“Like SFMOMA, Jane is a true San Francisco institution and a treasured gathering space for visitors. With its dedication to community welcome, fresh ingredients, and delightful baked creations, we could think of no better partner for our ground floor restaurant,” said Sheila Shin, SFMOMA’s Chief Operating Officer. “We look forward to introducing this exciting new partnership to enhance the Yerba Buena neighborhood and our visitors’ experience at SFMOMA.”

“With every new location, our goal is to create a welcoming spot where people feel comfortable dropping by any time, any day,” said Amanda Michael. “Whether it’s grabbing a pastry before work or catching up with friends after visiting the museum, we’re excited to bring a vibrant new space to the heart of downtown.”

**NEW MURAL BY CHELSEA RYOKO WONG**

SFMOMA has commissioned a site-specific mural by artist Chelsea Ryoko Wong to celebrate the launch of Jane on Third. A California muralist whose tableaux explore the choreography of friendship and the social harmony of diverse peoples, Wong’s dynamic new work will stretch the entirety of the new restaurant’s east wall.

Wong is known for her lively figure compositions inspired by the Bay Area. Using watercolor, gouache and acrylic techniques, Wong creates busy scenes of commingling people drawn from real-life events as well as her imagination. Her work celebrates racial and cultural diversity, promotes working class communities and evokes a sense of joy, curiosity and wonder.

Wong’s playful and inviting installation in SFMOMA’s Gina and Stuart Peterson White Box dazzled guests during the museum’s 2024 Art Bash gala. This year, SFMOMA acquired Wong’s _Slowing Down Time_(2024)—the first work by the artist to enter the permanent collection.

**BUSINESS HOURS AND OFFERINGS  
**Launching in August 2025, Jane on Third will be open seven days a week: Monday–Friday, 9 a.m.–5 p.m., and Saturday–Sunday, 10 a.m.–5 p.m. SFMOMA’s operating hours remain Friday–Tuesday, 10 a.m.–5 p.m., and Thursday, noon–8 p.m. The museum is closed on Wednesdays.
