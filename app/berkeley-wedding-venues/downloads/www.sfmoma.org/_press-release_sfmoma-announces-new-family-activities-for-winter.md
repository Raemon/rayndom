The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) is pleased to announce a new lineup of family programming for the winter 2012 season. Every Sunday in January (excluding January 1), February, and March, the museum galleries and family studio will be loaded with activities that encourage kids and families to engage with modern art and one another. The theme of the season is “Back to Basics,” focusing on lines, colors, and shapes. Led by SFMOMA educators and guest artists, Family Sunday programs are designed to spark experimentation and creativity, and to develop critical thinking skills.

On March 4, 2012, SFMOMA will host a Free Family Day, inviting families to take part in inventive art projects, hands-on gallery activities, and family fun—all free of admission.

**Family Sundays**

Every Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. (Note: SFMOMA will be closed to the public on Sunday, January 1)

Adult admission: $18; kids 12 and under are always free.

**Studio Activity**

**Texture Tangrams**

Families will experiment with shape and color while collaboratively creating abstract compositions. Two long walls of the studio will be covered in felt and serve as canvases. Families will have various shapes and colors of felt to use, and will be encouraged to create both representational and abstract images.

**Gallery Activities**

**Color Lapping**

_Mod_ erators will provide a variety of different materials for families to integrate in their color experimentations. Using the works in the landscape room on the second floor as inspiration, families can layer colored cellophane and torn paper inside colored “pockets” to work with the limitless varieties of color combinations. Emphasis will be placed on finding colors and shapes within the works on view that might work well in children and families’ compositions.

**Looming Lines**

Families will explore weaving with felt, pipe cleaners, and construction paper using a small personal felt loom/frame. _Mod_ erators will encourage families to look at the way 2010 SECA Award–winning artist Ruth Laskey transforms lines with colors and weaving techniques.

**Shape Folding**

In the sculpture garden, families will transform different lengths and shapes of paper into “large-scale” sculptures. By folding paper in different ways, families will explore basic concepts of scale and shape. If desired, _Mod_ erators will provide small-scale figurines for families to pose within their creations, as they were “placing” their work in the sculpture garden. Families may photograph with their mobile devices.

**Family Day**

Museum admission is FREE

Sunday, March 4, 11 a.m.–4 p.m.
