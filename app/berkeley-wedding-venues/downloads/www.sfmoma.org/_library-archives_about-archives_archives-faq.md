###  I own an artwork. Can you tell me how much it is worth? 

Expand details

SFMOMA staff cannot provide such evaluations. Please consult an appraiser to determine the value of your artwork. Appraisers are trained specialists who work for a fee. They will evaluate your piece and give you a written statement of its value. The following organizations do not provide appraisals themselves, but each publishes a directory of its members. Always seek an appraiser with an expertise in the type of artwork you own.

Some auction houses host “open house” days where visitors can bring in their artworks and staff members will share their expertise for free. Other houses allow owners to mail in their information with a photograph, and their experts will respond. To find an auction house in your area, search online for “fine art auction houses.”
