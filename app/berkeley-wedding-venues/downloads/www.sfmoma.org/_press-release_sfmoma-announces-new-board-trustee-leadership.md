SAN FRANCISCO, CA (June 10, 2025)—The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) today announced the election of Diana Nelson as chair and Alka Agrawal as president of its board of trustees, marking the first time in the museum’s history that both leadership roles will be held by women. Nelson has served as SFMOMA’s board president for the past seven years. Agrawal, a trustee since 2012 and a member of the Executive Committee since 2021, now steps into the role of board president. Robert (Bob) Fisher, who has served as board chair since 2018 and led the museum through a transformative period of expansion and reinvention, will transition to chair emeritus. These appointments reflect SFMOMA’s continued commitment to visionary governance and to strengthening its board through new voices, perspectives and expertise. The leadership transition will take effect on September 4, 2025.

“I am truly honored to serve as chair of SFMOMA’s board of trustees at a pivotal moment in the museum’s trajectory,” said Nelson. “SFMOMA is a vibrant jewel in the cultural life of San Francisco and our country. Alka and I are fortunate to collaborate with Chris Bedford, a dynamic leader, as well as the museum’s talented staff and dedicated fellow trustees—working in alignment to propel the vision for SFMOMA to be a vibrant, audience-centered destination. Bob Fisher has been a tremendous leader and partner. I am grateful for his commitment and ongoing support.”

“This institution means a tremendous amount to me and my entire family, and it has been an honor to steward SFMOMA’s board of trustees. In that time, the museum achieved many critical goals, overcame challenges and developed a strong vision forward. While the landscape in which SFMOMA, and our peer institutions, continues to shift, the museum is on the right path to succeed and continue its vital service to the community,” said Fisher. “With the museum establishing its next chapter, this is the right moment for new board leadership to help guide and advocate for our institution. I look forward to working with Diana and Alka, who both bring tremendous knowledge, insight and experience, and to seeing firsthand the strong impact I know their leadership will bring.”

**About Diana Nelson**

Diana Nelson has been a trustee of SFMOMA since 2006. She previously held the roles of vice chair and president of the board, and has long served on the Committee on Trustees, Executive Committee, Finance Committee, and Main Accessions Committee. She was vice chair of the museum’s $610 million capital campaign, which culminated in the opening of the transformed SFMOMA in 2016 and co-chaired the 2020 Director Search Committee, resulting in the appointment of Christopher Bedford as the museum’s current Helen and Charles Schwab Director. Nelson’s tenure has emphasized institutional growth, leadership and public access to the arts.

Nelson currently serves as co-chair of Carlson Holdings, Inc., a privately held enterprise that encompasses Carlson Investment Group, Carlson Private Capital and Carlson Real Estate. She brings decades of board governance and business leadership experience, having served as chair of Carlson, a global travel and hospitality company from 2013–2019 and the board of governors of Carlson Holdings.

Nelson is a member of the Harvard Corporation board and was formerly the vice-chair of the Harvard Board of Overseers. She is a trustee for Common Sense Media, a nonprofit dedicated to helping kids thrive in a world of media and technology. Nelson was also chair of the U.S. World Childhood Foundation, dedicated to protecting children at risk from trafficking, abuse and poverty.

Raised in Minnesota, Nelson earned a BA in Art History from Harvard College and an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. Her broad commitments reflect a deep belief in the power of institutions to serve the public good through education and cultural access.

**About Alka Agrawal**

Alka Agrawal and her husband Ravin joined the museum in 2004. Agrawal was elected to SFMOMA’s board of trustees in 2012 and elected chair of the Development Committee and member of the board’s Executive Committee in 2021. During her tenure, Agrawal has held multiple volunteer leadership roles at the museum, including co-chair of the 2010 SECA Art Awards in its 50th anniversary year, chair of the 2011 Bay Area Treasure Award, chair of the 2013 Art Auction, co-chair of the 2016 inaugural Art Bash, and chair of the Curators’ Circle. Agrawal also serves on SFMOMA’s Finance Committee, Governance Committee, Media Arts Accessions Committee and the Committee on Trustees.

A dedicated art collector and former Los Angeles gallery director, Agrawal is a passionate advocate for education and public access to modern and contemporary art. She also serves on the Director’s Advisory Council of the Harvard Art Museums, on the board of governors of the Addison Gallery of American Art and as a member of the International Council of the Museum of Modern Art.

“I have long been a supporter of SFMOMA, recognizing it as a singular institution deeply invested in both scholarship and audience experience. As a trustee, I have embraced any opportunity to support and advance SFMOMA’s goals and now look forward to serving our mission through this new role,” said Agrawal. “I am honored to be able to collaborate closely with Diana, Chris, and the board as we consider the future. There is terrific excitement and enthusiasm for the many possibilities ahead.”

**Robert (Bob) Fisher and SFMOMA**

Born and raised in San Francisco, Bob Fisher has been a lifelong art lover and devoted supporter of SFMOMA. Fisher has served as a member of SFMOMA’s board of trustees for more than 20 years—since 2003. He has led the museum as board chair since 2018, and prior to that as board president from 2010 to 2018. Over his tenure, Fisher has sponsored numerous exhibitions, including most recently _Ruth Asawa: Retrospective_ and the upcoming survey _Suzanne Jackson: What Is Love._ He has additionally loaned exceptional works of art. Fisher was a member of the Architect Selection Committee, the Collections Campaign Committee and Capital Campaign Committee for SFMOMA’s expansion, which included new education and performance spaces, expanded indoor and outdoor galleries and free admission for visitors 18 and under. He provided invaluable leadership as the museum navigated the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, and he co-chaired the 2020 Director Search Committee. He was also instrumental in forging the landmark partnership between the Fisher family and SFMOMA, which resulted in the 100-year loan of the renowned Doris and Donald Fisher Collection to the museum. Fisher is a longtime photography collector and has made strong investments in the museum’s photography holdings.

Fisher is the former chairman of Gap Inc. and has served on the company’s board since 1990. He spent his professional career at Gap, leading in different capacities, including as COO and president of Gap brand and Banana Republic, as well as interim CEO in 2007. Fisher was responsible for launching Gap’s online business in 1997 and has played an important role in the company’s sustainability work.

In 2009, Fisher and his wife Randi founded the Pisces Foundation, which focuses on environmental education, water resources and climate and energy. He also co-founded the Water Foundation for water management in the American West. Fisher was appointed by former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as the public member of the Strategic Growth Council (SGC) in 2009 and was appointed as vice chair of the organization in 2014 by former Governor Jerry Brown. The SGC brings together agencies and departments within the California state government to support sustainable communities, emphasizing strong economies, social equity and environmental stewardship. Fisher served for over two decades on the board of the Natural Resources Defense Council and sits on the board of trustees for Conservation International.

Fisher earned a BA in English Literature from Princeton University and an MBA from Stanford University Graduate School of Business.

“Bob Fisher has been an exemplary leader and his essential contributions to SFMOMA can be felt across the entirety of the museum. I am immensely grateful for his guidance, vision and profound commitment to SFMOMA, as well as the support that he has offered me personally,” said Christopher Bedford, Helen and Charles Schwab Director of SFMOMA. “Likewise, I have had the good fortune of closely collaborating with Diana Nelson and Alka Agrawal during my time at SFMOMA, and know them to be deeply astute, thoughtful and passionate. Their experience and expertise will be invaluable as we continue to forge SFMOMA’s future. As we navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead, our institution will benefit greatly from the leadership of these two incredibly capable women at our helm.”
