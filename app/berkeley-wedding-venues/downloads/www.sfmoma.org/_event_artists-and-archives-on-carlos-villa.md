A professor at the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI) for over 40 years, Carlos Villa left a remarkable legacy through his deeply intertwined roles as educator, artist, and activist.

In this special program, Villa’s collaborator and friend **Jenifer K Wofford** will be joined by archivist and public historian [**Moriah Ulinskas**](https://www.moriahulinskas.com/) as well as [SFAI Legacy Foundation + Archive Archivist](https://www.sfailegacyarchive.org/) and longtime SFAI librarian **Jeff Gunderson** to reflect on _Worlds in Collision_ , the artist’s iconic series of exhibitions, symposia, curricula, and publications. Spanning from 1976 until his passing in 2013, this body of work showcases Villa’s visionary, polycultural approach, deeply rooted in his Filipino American identity and marked by an expansiveness that reshaped conversations around multiculturalism, identity, and the arts.

Through primary documents, personal stories, and reflections on Villa’s profound impact on his students and the Bay Area arts community, the evening will offer an intimate look into his life and work and how his legacy continues to influence the lives and practices of those who knew him.

We’ll also share a celebratory birthday cake in honor of Carlos Villa on what would have been his 89th birthday.

This program is part of the Artists and Archives series, in which artists connected to SFAI share stories and projects from their own practices related to archives — or reflect on the histories and archival materials left behind by artists.
