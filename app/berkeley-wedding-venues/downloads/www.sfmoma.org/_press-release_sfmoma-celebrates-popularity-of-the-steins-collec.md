The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) will extend viewing hours of its popular summer exhibition _The Steins Collect: Matisse, Picasso, and the Parisian Avant-Garde_ in response to high demand. The show has received overwhelmingly favorable critical reviews and is expected to host some 350,000 visitors by the time it closes on September 6, at the end of what has unofficially been dubbed the “Summer of Stein” in San Francisco. During the exhibition’s final weeks, the public can enjoy expanded museum hours on Saturday evenings, while SFMOMA members will have exclusive morning access to the show between 9 and 10 a.m. on weekends and Monday, September 5.

_The Steins Collect_ reunites the unparalleled modern art collections of author Gertrude Stein, her brothers Leo and Michael Stein, and Michael’s wife, Sarah Stein. The story of the family’s adventurous patronage of visual arts and the presentation of iconic works they collected has been met with enthusiasm from local and visiting audiences alike; _The San Francisco Chronicle_ proclaimed the exhibition “Breathtaking,” and _The New York Times_ praised it as “Spectacular”. The show is one of the highest attended exhibitions in SFMOMA’s recent history. As the exhibition’s sole venue on the West Coast, SFMOMA is proud to offer expanded access to the show before it travels to Paris and New York. For more information about the exhibition, [see the full release](https://www.sfmoma.org/about/press/press_exhibitions/releases/862).
