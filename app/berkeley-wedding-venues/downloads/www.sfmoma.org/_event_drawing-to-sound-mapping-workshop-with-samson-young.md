In this two-day hands-on workshop, led by artist Samson Young and informed by his practice, participants will experiment with mapping a drawing to sound through software and computational processes. During these workshops, participants will build their own tools and explore different approaches to mapping their drawing, from linear to intuitive. The workshop will use ChucK music programming language in combination with the TouchDesigner environment, communicating via the OSC protocol. Participants will build skills in using these tools from the ground up, while also progressing quickly to creative work and exploration. Through this process, the workshop will examine how these techniques and tools can influence the artist’s voice and creative intent. 

This workshop is suitable for beginners and assumes no prior knowledge of these software programs or programming. **Participants are required to bring their own laptop (mac preferred, PC okay) with the following programs installed:**

  * **[ChucK](https://chuck.stanford.edu/release/)**
  * **[Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/downloads/)**
  * **[TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/community-post/2023-official-update/68688)** (participants can register for a non-commercial account, which is free)
