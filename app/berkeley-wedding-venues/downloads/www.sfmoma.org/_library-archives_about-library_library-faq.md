###  I own an artwork. Can you identify it or tell me how much it is worth? 

Expand details

SFMOMA staff cannot provide such evaluations. We are happy to recommend research resources, such as catalogues raisonnés and auction catalogs. Please consult an appraiser to determine the value of your artwork. Appraisers are trained specialists who work for a fee. They will evaluate your piece and give you a written statement of its value. The following organizations do not provide appraisals themselves, but each publishes a directory of its members. Always seek an appraiser with an expertise in the type of artwork you own.
