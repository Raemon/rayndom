SAN FRANCISCO, CA (May 1, 2019) — The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) announces the ninth season of _Modern Cinema_ featuring _Haunted! Gothic Tales by Women_ , a film series exploring the dynamic interactions between cinema’s past and present. This summer’s _Modern Cinema_ presentation will feature films inspired by gothic tales written by women and spans 80 years of filmmaking. From July 17 to August 31, moviegoers can indulge their dark side in SFMOMA’s Phyllis Wattis Theater while taking advantage of the museum’s extended summer hours every Thursday and Saturday evening until 9 p.m. SFMOMA will collaborate with the San Francisco Public Library on special features and speakers connecting the films and local authors.

“The gothic tale has been associated with women writers since the dawn of the genre as a creative way to explore and provide perspective and agency around social themes,” said Gina Basso, SFMOMA manager of film programs. “Since so many of these films begin with literary sources, what a perfect opportunity to partner with the San Francisco Public Library.”

While showcasing cinema’s most recognized and celebrated gothic tales, _Haunted!_ also highlights the extraordinary contributions made by women writers using the genre as a framework for storytelling across literature and screenwriting. Films in the series are adapted from the celebrated literary works of the **Brontë sisters** , **Shirley Jackson** , **Harper Lee** , **Daphne du Maurier** ,**Toni Morrison** , **Anne Rice,** **Mary Shelley** and more.

“A pervasive thread running through the narratives presented in this series reveal the sinister mechanisms with which the mind and the body can be used as sites for power and oppression. The gothic genre is all about the return of repressed traumas, memories and desires and plays upon fears of the unknown — an old house, a hidden attic, a dark forest or a stranger — and suggests deeper anxieties around race, gender, class and sexuality. The stories also demonstrate an array of other influences such as thrillers, fairy tales, romance, suspense and horror,” added Basso.

_Haunted!_ offers classic films such as **Alfred Hitchcock’s _Rebecca,_ Robert Wise’s _The Haunting_** and **Robert Mulligan’s _To Kill a Mockingbird_** , as well as newer selections to the film canon such as **Jennifer Kent’s _The Babadook,_ Ana Lily Amirpour’s _A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night_** and **Park Chan-wook’s _The Handmaiden_**. On a day devoted to cinematic interpretations of works by the **Brontë sisters** , visitors can compare and contrast the original **William Wyler** version of **_Wuthering Heights_ **with **Andrea Arnold’s** contemporary version and conclude with **Cary Fukunaga’s** recent **_Jane Eyre_**. International selections are also highly represented in the _Haunted!_ series with features including **Nobuhiko Obayashi’s** surreal**_Hausu,_ Peter Weir’s _Picnic at Hanging Rock,_ Jean Cocteau’s **darkly hued fairytale vision of**_Beauty and the Beast_** , **Nicolas Roeg’s _Don’t Look Now_** and a rare screening of **Tracey Moffatt’s** suite of ghost stories, **_beDevil_** , the first film written and directed by an Australian Aboriginal woman.

_Haunted!_ coincides with **_Suzanne Lacy: We are Here_** , the first full retrospective of the artist’s work presented in collaboration with Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (YBCA). Lacy, a pioneer of socially engaged art, creates work that brings attention to the societal challenges faced by women. Documentation of her performance piece _Construction of a Novel Frankenstein_(1975) is on view as part of the exhibition and examines the tale of Frankenstein in relation to the personal life of author **Mary Shelley**. Audiences will also find themes associated with Dracula and vampires in Lacy’s _Under My Skin: A True-Life Story_ (1975/1977) and _Autobiography of a Young Vampire_ (1974–75). The pairing of _Haunted!_ with _We are Here_ offers visitors additional context to each medium.

### About the Phyllis Wattis Theater at SFMOMA

As part of the opening of the expanded SFMOMA in May 2016, the Phyllis Wattis Theater also received a major renovation and system update creating one of the most enjoyable places to see film in the Bay Area. A state-of-the-art NEC digital projector offers _Modern Cinema_ the ability to present films on a 24 x 12-foot screen with the capacity to show aspect ratios of 1:37, 1:66, 1:85 and 2:39. The Wattis Theater can also screen films via Kinoton projectors in 16 and 35mm formats. Because sound is integral to the cinematic experience, a Meyer Sound Cinema Surround System enhances the nuance and precision intended by filmmakers. Comfortable seating with cup holders round out the Wattis Theater experience.
