# Our DEI Commitment

The foundation of SFMOMA is its belief that modern and contemporary art can influence the way we think, view the world, and embrace the many voices and perspectives around us. And yet, we acknowledge that institutional practices have perpetuated a system that caused some people to be neglected and silenced. We are committed to repairing and building trust, and being an inclusive, accessible museum for people of color, LGBTQ+ people, women, people with disabilities, and many other integral members of our internal and external communities.

We, the staff and board of trustees, aspire to foster an environment that elicits joy, nurtures a sense of belonging and purpose, and embodies our values—where difference is seen as a strength, and everyone is appreciated for their whole self.

This commitment requires dedication that must permeate all we do on individual and institutional levels. As we continue this journey to transform our culture from the inside out, we pledge to prioritize diversity, equity, inclusion, and access, across our museum and throughout our community—staff, board, artists, members, donors, visitors, volunteers, and the public.

We encourage open and ongoing dialogue with you about our progress. All forms of feedback are welcome and will be shared with our colleagues in the relevant departments. Please contact us at [DEI@sfmoma.org](mailto:DEI@sfmoma.org).

### DEI Strategic Plan 

Our DEI strategic plan aims to improve and reinforce diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts across the museum. The DEI Strategic Plan, which is interwoven into the organization-wide strategic priorities, outlines the museum’s high-level objectives and tactics to support four main DEI goals:

  * Build awareness of DEI issues
  * Enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion
  * Foster community and belonging
  * Improve organizational accountability and transparency in systems and structures

### FY23 Data Dashboard

At the heart of SFMOMA’s mission is a commitment to connecting people to the art of our time. Utilizing 2022–2023 data, this dashboard is meant to provide a transparent and interactive view into the museum’s progress in engaging a broader audience, diversifying our collections, visitors, board, and staff, and prioritizing our strategic goals.
