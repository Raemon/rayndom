Every two years, SFMOMA celebrates Bay Area artists and our creative community with the [SECA Art Award](https://www.sfmoma.org/membership/seca/seca-art-award/). Established in 1967, the award has honored nearly one hundred local recipients with an exhibition and platform for expanding their practices and sharing their work with new audiences. The _2024 SECA Art Award_ exhibition celebrates Rose D’Amato, Angela Hennessy, and Rupy C. Tut. Each artist has conceived a gallery with new works that bring distinct perspectives, processes, and materials into the museum.

**Rose D’Amato** (b. 1991, Whittier, California) lives and works in San Francisco. As a second-generation sign maker, she is drawn to decorative folk arts, hand lettering, and the iconic imagery tied to her upbringing and direct experience pinstriping and lettering on lowriders.

**Angela Hennessy** (b. 1971, Monterey, California) is an Oakland-based artist who constructs sculptures and installations through the gestures of domestic labor — washing, wrapping, stitching, knotting, brushing, and braiding. 

**Rupy C. Tut** (b. 1985, Chandigarh, India) preserves and reimagines the tradition of eighteenth-century Indian painting through her depictions of women, landscapes, and ancestral figures. Her process is grounded in the labor of making, from grinding and mixing mineral pigments to using fine-tip brushes.
