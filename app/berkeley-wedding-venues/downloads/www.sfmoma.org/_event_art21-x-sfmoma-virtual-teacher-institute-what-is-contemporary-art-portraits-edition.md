Why are portraits powerful? How do contemporary artists make portraits? From traditional paintings to more experimental renderings, artists like Amy Sherald and William Scott use the practice of portraiture to elevate figures in popular culture like celebrities and politicians, as well as everyday people. Considering the long tradition of portraiture painting, we’ll explore why it continues to be relevant for 21st-century artists and the diverse methods they use to represent a range of figures.

Co-presented by SFMOMA and Art21, this workshop is part of a series exploring two different aspects of the question, “What is contemporary art?” Each workshop encourages educators to think and work like artists, using thematic, inquiry-driven processes and strategies.
