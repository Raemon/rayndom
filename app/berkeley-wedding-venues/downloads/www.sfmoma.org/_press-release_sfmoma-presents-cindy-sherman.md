From July 14 to October 8, 2012, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) will host the sole West Coast presentation of _Cindy Sherman_ , a traveling retrospective of one of the most significant contemporary artists and arguably the most influential one working exclusively with photography. Known for photographing herself in a range of guises and personas that are by turns amusing and disturbing, distasteful and affecting, Sherman has built an international reputation for an extraordinary body of work. Tracing her career from the mid-1970s to present, the exhibition is the first major U.S. retrospective of the artist in nearly 15 years, introducing Sherman to a new generation of audiences.

Organized by Eva Respini of The Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA), _Cindy Sherman_ brings together more than 150 photographs from both public and private collections, including key works from SFMOMA’s own holdings. The presentation at SFMOMA is overseen by Erin O’Toole, assistant curator of photography, and is the first major exhibition of Sherman’s work ever mounted in San Francisco.

Throughout her career, Sherman has presented a sustained, eloquent, and provocative exploration of the construction of contemporary identity, the nature of representation, and the artifice of photography. Her works resonate deeply with our visual culture, drawing from the unlimited supply of images from movies, television, magazines, the Internet, and art history. Today Sherman’s work is the unchallenged cornerstone of postmodern photography.

Masquerading as myriad characters in front of her camera, Sherman has served as her own model for more than 30 years, constructing invented personas and tableaus. To create her photographs, she works unassisted in her studio, and assumes multiple roles as photographer, model, art director, makeup artist, hairdresser, and stylist. Through her skillful guises, she has created an astonishing and continually intriguing variety of culturally resonant characters, from sexy starlet to clown to aging socialite.

“Sherman’s work is particularly relevant to today’s image-saturated culture because she reminds us to be critical consumers of what we see,” says O’Toole. “She holds a mirror up to contemporary society, calling attention to the strangeness of things we tend to see as normal, like fashion, makeup, and plastic surgery.”

**Exhibition Overview**

Born in 1954 in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, Sherman received her BA from Buffalo State College and moved to New York City in 1977, where she has resided ever since. The exhibition showcases the remarkable range of Sherman’s photography, from her early experiments as a student in Buffalo to her recent large-scale photographic murals, which are customized to fit each installation site. The presentation examines some of the dominant themes prevalent throughout Sherman’s work, such as artifice and fiction, cinema and performance, horror and the grotesque, myth and fairy tale, and gender and class identity.

A selection of ambitious and celebrated works will be highlighted, including a complete set of the seminal _Untitled Film Stills_ (1977–80)—70 black-and-white photographs that feature the artist in stereotypical female roles inspired by 1950s and 1960s Hollywood, film noir, and European art-house films—and all twelve of her centerfolds (1981), in addition to selections from her significant series of works: fairy tale/mythology (1985); history portraits (1988–90); sex pictures (1992); headshots (2000); clowns (2002–04); fashion (1983–84, 1993–94, 2007–08); and society portraits (2008).

The exhibition also premieres, in the U.S., a recently created photographic mural (2010–11) that represents the artist’s first foray into transforming space through site-specific fictive environments. In the mural, Sherman transforms her face digitally, exaggerating her features through Photoshop by elongating her nose, narrowing her eyes, or creating smaller lips. The characters, who sport an odd mix of costumes and are taken from daily life, are elevated to larger-than-life status and tower over the viewer. Set against a decorative toile backdrop, her characters seem like protagonists from their own carnivalesque worlds, where fantasy and reality merge. The new work included in the retrospective offers an opportunity for reassessment in light of the latest developments in Sherman’s oeuvre.

**Catalogue and Exhibition Tour**

A fully illustrated publication accompanies the exhibition, with essays by exhibition curator Eva Respini and art historian Johann Burton, as well as a new interview with Sherman conducted by filmmaker and artist John Waters.

_Cindy Sherman_ premiered at MoMA in New York (February 26–June 11, 2012), and following SFMOMA’s presentation, it will travel to the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (November 10, 2012–February 17, 2013), and Dallas Museum of Art (March 17–June 9, 2013).

Cindy Sherman is organized by The Museum of Modern Art, New York. Major support for the San Francisco presentation is provided by the Fisher family, J.P. Morgan, and The Bernard Osher Foundation. Generous support is provided by Carla Emil and Rich Silverstein, Nion McEvoy, and the Bernard and Barbro Osher Exhibition Fund. The St. Regis San Francisco is the official hotel of this exhibition.

**Public Programs**

In conjunction with the exhibition, SFMOMA will present _Cindy Sherman Selects_ , a series of films—selected by Sherman—that have shaped her artistic vision. Reflecting a wide spectrum of genres and eras, the films highlight the extraordinary range of her interests and influences.__ Screenings will take place on Thursday evenings in July and August during the exhibition’s run. Tickets are $5 for general admission; free for SFMOMA members or with museum admission.

**The Host**  
Bong Joon-Ho, 2006, 119 min., 35mm  
Thursday, July 26, 7 p.m.

**Suture**  
Scott McGehee and David Siegel, 1993, 96 min., 35mm  
Thursday, August 2, 7 p.m.

Clay survives Vincent’s car bomb, but suffers severe amnesia. With the help of a plastic surgeon named Renee Descartes, Clay sets out to reconstruct his identity—but as Vincent, the prime suspect in their father’s murder. As Clay’s memory begins to return, he must decide which life he will embody.

Museum and program admission are free.  
As part of _Cindy Sherman Selects_ , SFMOMA screens two influential experimental films. Composed almost entirely of still photographs and considered one of the most beautiful films of all time, _La Jetée_ depicts an underground, post–World War III world, where drug-induced time travel is used to send a prisoner to the future for help. _Meshes of the Afternoon_ , Deren and Hammid’s best-known collaboration, exemplifies the filmmakers’ signature style of beauty and surrealism.

**Wanda**

Thursday, August 9, 7 p.m.  
Set in the coal mining region of Pennsylvania, this film follows Wanda, an alcoholic who abandons her husband and children for a life of drinking and sleeping with strange men.

Restored by UCLA Film & Television Archive with funding provided by Gucci and the Film Foundation. Print courtesy UCLA Film and Television Archive.

**The Texas Chainsaw Massacre**  
Tobe Hooper, 1974, 83 min., 35mm  
Thursday, August 16, 7 p.m.  
The horror film classic _The Texas Chainsaw Massacre_ follows a group of young travelers whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere to their misfortune. Known for originating many of the staples of the slasher genre—such as a faceless killer and power tools as weapons—it also functioned as a critique of the meat industry.

**Shadows**  
John Cassavetes, 1959, 81 min., 35mm  
Thursday, August 23, 7 p.m.  
Part documentary, part fiction, Shadows explores race relations during the Beat Generation years in New York City. A model of independent film, it was shot with a 16mm handheld camera on the streets of New York, much of the dialogue was improvised, and the cast and crew were made up almost entirely of volunteers. A jazz-infused soundtrack complements the subject matter and the era in which the film was born. Print courtesy of UCLA Film & Television Archive.

**Kick-Ass**  
Matthew Vaughan, 2010, 117 min., 35mm  
Thursday, August 30, 7 p.m.  
Based on a comic book, _Kick-Ass_ follows the adventures of an average teenager, who, without any real powers or training, dons an Internet-bought green and- yellow wetsuit and sets out to become a real-life superhero. Along the way, he encounters fellow DIY superheroes Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and his preteen daughter Hit Girl (Chloë Moretz). Together they must ward off the evil of a local mobster and his teenage son, Kick Ass’s arch-nemesis.
