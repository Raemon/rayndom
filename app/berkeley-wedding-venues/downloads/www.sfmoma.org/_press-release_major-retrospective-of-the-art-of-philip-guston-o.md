The most comprehensive survey to date of the work of Philip Guston will be on view at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) from June 28 through September 28, 2003. _Philip Guston Retrospective_ includes more than 100 paintings and drawings that range from the artist’s early figurative works of the 1930s to a group of rarely seen paintings completed in the years before his death in 1980. SFMOMA has a substantial history with this critical artist: the Museum organized his last in-depth retrospective in 1979 and owns several Guston works.

_Philip Guston Retrospective_ was organized by the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas. The curator of the exhibition is Michael Auping, chief curator of the Modern Art Museum; overseeing the San Francisco presentation is Madeleine Grynsztejn, Elise S. Haas Senior Curator of Painting and Sculpture at SFMOMA. An [online interactive feature](/view/page.display/interactive_feature/content.interactive_feature/2), produced by SFMOMA’s Education Department in conjunction with _Philip Guston Retrospective,_ offers an in-depth look into Guston’s personal history, the role of his iconography, and the artist’s risky and often controversial transitions between figuration and abstraction.

“Philip Guston was a leading figure of the avant-garde whose influence continues to be felt today,” said Grynsztejn. “He moved from figuration to abstraction, finally returning to figuration late in his life in a shift that was considered extremely risky at that time. Given SFMOMA’s long association with Guston, we are the ideal venue in which to present this important career overview.”

_Philip Guston Retrospective_ begins with figurative works dating from the 1930s and 1940s that reflect Guston’s early and wide-ranging pictorial interests, including the work of Giorgio De Chirico and Pablo Picasso. Such influences are evident in the two earliest works in the exhibition, _Mother and Child_ and _Drawing for Conspirators,_ both completed in 1930 when Guston was just 17, in which swollen, ominous hooded figures are located in eerie, vacant cityscapes. Guston’s interest in German Expressionism, particularly the work of Max Beckmann, is clear in paintings such as _Martial Memory,_ 1941, and _Porch No. 2,_ 1947, in which children are brought together in strange battle scenes in a compressed and layered space.

These early figurative works are followed by a pivotal group of transitional paintings that reflect the artist’s entry into abstraction and his involvement with Abstract Expressionism, including _The Tormentors,_ 1947–48; _Review,_ 1949–50; _Red Painting,_ 1950; and _White Painting I,_ 1951\. Beginning with _The Tormentors,_ Guston gradually unravels the figurative scaffolding that he used throughout the 1940s into subtle painterly abstraction. Anchoring the center of the exhibition is a major group of Guston’s lush abstractions from the 1950s and 1960s in which rich, delicately applied brushstrokes come together to suggest floating, abstract forms. These works include _To B.W.T.,_ 1952; _Painting,_ 1954; _Zone,_ 1953–54; _Beggar’s Joys,_ 1954–55; and _For M,_ 1955\. (_The Tormentors,_ _White Painting I_ and _For M_ are all part of SFMOMA’s permanent collection.)

Interspersed throughout _Philip Guston Retrospective_ is a revealing survey of drawings from different stages of the artist’s career. Guston began drawing at the age of 12 and consistently relied on that medium as a way to work out ideas and structure his compositions. During each decade of Guston’s life, drawing invariably announced changes in his imagery.

In the late 1960s Guston’s abstractions gradually evolved into stark, semifigurative forms that took on the shape of heads and later became simple, utilitarian objects such as books, light bulbs and shoes. This late figurative evolution was presented in the artist’s controversial yet highly acclaimed 1970 exhibition at the Marlborough Gallery in New York City. That exhibition, which included his symbolically loaded hooded figures, had a powerful impact on at least three generations of artists who have subsequently re-engaged figuration after decades in which abstraction dominated American painting. Among the works on view in the SFMOMA presentation that were included in that groundbreaking exhibition are _Blackboard,_ 1969; _Edge of Town,_ 1969; _The Studio,_ 1969; and _Flatlands,_ 1970 (collection SFMOMA). Also on view at SFMOMA is _By the Window,_ 1969, in which Guston creates poignant autobiographical statements. The finale of the exhibition includes the grand still lifes and landscapes that occupied Guston throughout the 1970s. This section includes major canvases such as _Pit,_ 1976; _Couple in Bed,_ 1977; and _The Street,_ 1977\. The exhibition ends with a group of rarely seen small paintings completed in the years before his death in 1980. Following its tenure at SFMOMA, the exhibition will travel to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the Royal Academy of Arts, London.

An extensive catalogue published by Thames and Hudson in conjunction with _Philip Guston Retrospective_ is available at the SFMOMA MuseumStore or on the Museum’s Web site at www.sfmoma.org. The hardcover sells for $50 ($45 for SFMOMA members) and the softcover for $40 ($36 for SFMOMA members). Essayists include exhibition curator Michael Auping; Dore Ashton, art historian and author; Bill Berkson, poet and longtime friend of the artist; Andrew Graham-Dixon, chief art critic for London’s _The Independent_ from 1986 to 1998; Joseph Rishel, curator of European painting at the Philadelphia Museum of Art; and Michael E. Shapiro, director of the High Museum of Art, Atlanta. An interactive multimedia program on Guston approaches the life and work of the artist through SFMOMA’s painting _Back View_. It features footage of the artist at work and an interview with exhibition curator Michael Auping. It can be viewed in the Museum’s fourth-floor galleries and Koret Visitor Education Center.

_Philip Guston Retrospective_ was organized by the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Fort Worth, Texas and made possible by The Burnett Foundation and special funding from Gerald L. Lennard. Support for SFMOMA’s presentation has been generously provided by Roselyne Chroman Swig.
