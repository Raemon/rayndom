From November 5 through December 23, 2003, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) Artists Gallery will celebrate its 25th anniversary with a commemorative exhibition at Fort Mason Center, Building A, in San Francisco. **The SFMOMA Artists Gallery 25th Anniversary Exhibition** surveys some one thousand artists who have been presented there throughout its history. Showcasing approximately 90 works of painting, sculpture and photography by established and emerging Bay Area artists including Robert Bechtle, Lynn Briscoe, Todd Hido, Mike Henderson, Amy Kaufman, M. Louise Stanley, Kelli Yon and many others, this event is a rare opportunity to review three eclectic decades of Northern California art. It is also an excellent way for collectors to make affordable purchases. The opening reception will be held on Wednesday, November 5, from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., with food, wine and live music by the jazz ensemble Cross Currents, lead by Roger Tuan. Proceeds support SFMOMA Artists Gallery programs, which promote regional art, SFMOMA and the exhibiting artists. **This exhibition is free and open to the public.**

In honor of this anniversary milestone, the Bay Area’s own Trillium Press has produced a suite of eight unique fine-art prints by Willard Dixon, Enrique Chagoya, Kara Maria, Tucker Nichols, Gustavo Rivera, Inez Storer, Heather Wilcoxon and William T. Wiley, offered exclusively through the Artists Gallery. Purchases or rentals beginning at $5,000 entitle the client to an archival quality, signed and editioned print of his or her choice; transactions of $10,000 or more qualify for two prints; transactions of $15,000 or more qualify for three prints; and transactions of $20,000 or higher entitle the client to the entire eight-print suite. A limited number of these prints will also be available for sale to the public.

The SFMOMA Artists Gallery was founded in 1978 as an innovative rental program that offers paintings, sculptures, photographs and prints to the public for rent, with the option to buy. Founders Marian Parmenter and Sally Lilienthal envisioned a place for art unlike any other in the Bay Area—a space that would support artists economically and offer them the opportunity to exhibit their work, while providing seasoned collectors, corporate clients and art-world newcomers an affordable way to enjoy original art.

Artist Robert Brokl comments: “Parmenter and Lilienthal visited my studio at UC Berkeley over 20 years ago. The Artists Gallery has been integral to my career ever since. The gallery gives shows to fresh MFAs and deserving ‘finds,’ but it also helps outfit and sustain artists for the long haul and lifetimes of art making. I’ve been in shows around the country and the world for over 25 years, but I’ve yet to find another gallery to match the Artists Gallery for support and sensitivity to my work.”  
The SFMOMA Artists Gallery mounts eleven exhibitions each year. Programs include solo exhibitions, group and theme shows, and occasional career retrospectives of mature artists. The Artists Gallery maintains a selection of work ranging stylistically from traditional still lifes to lyrical landscapes to cutting-edge works in experimental media.

**The Artists Gallery is open Tuesday through Saturday, 11:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Visit https://www.sfmoma.org or call 415.441.4777 for more information.**
