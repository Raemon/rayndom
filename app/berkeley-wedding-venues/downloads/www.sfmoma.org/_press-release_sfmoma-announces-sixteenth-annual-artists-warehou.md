**“Sweet 16 Annual Event Features Hundreds of Original Works by Bay Area Artists all Sale Priced”**

The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) Artists Gallery will hold its annual Artists’ Warehouse Sale from Wednesday, May 6, through Sunday, May 10, 2009 at San Francisco’s Fort Mason Center, Building A. An annual tradition since 1993, the Artists’ Warehouse Sale is one of the Bay Area’s most anticipated art events. Popular with both new and seasoned collectors, the five-day sale features paintings, photographs, sculptures, prints, and works on paper at 50% off regular retail price. Sale proceeds benefit the programs of the SFMOMA Artists Gallery, which supports both the Museum and regional artists.

With affordable, original art priced from $50–$5,000 visitors can purchase paintings, sculpture, drawings, and unframed works on paper by more than 300 emerging and established Bay Area artists. Among the artists included are Mark Jaremko, Kara Maria, Terry Thompson, Katherine Westerhout, Heather Wilcoxon, and Jason Winshell, just a few. The multi-day event begins Wednesday, May 6 at 6 p.m. with a special preview reception to give eager buyers first chance at the deals—tickets are $10. From Thursday, May 7 to Sunday, May 10 the event is open to the public and admission is free.

On Friday, May 8 from 6–8 p.m. artists Bert Bergen, Tim Svenonius, and Charles Valoroso create fantastical drawings from sympathetic monsters and prehistoric animals, to patriotic emblems, as part of the Gallery’s new live drawing event. These one-of-a-kind drawings will be offered for sale at very affordable prices.

On Saturday, May 9 from 2–4 p.m., the Gallery is hosting its first ever _Meet the Designer_ event featuring award-winning designer Gary Hutton. Samples from the Gary Hutton furniture collection and the designer himself will be on hand to talk about marrying original art with his unique designs. “Art and Design are like salt and pepper,” says Hutton. “Each is distinctly different from the other, but entirely complementary. Like good cuisine, no good environment is complete without both.”

Sunday, May 10 is the Artists Gallery Family Day featuring children’s activities, face painting, and live music. The Alphabet Rockers will perform educational songs with a hip-hop beat from 1–1:45 p.m. 

In addition, each year the Artists Gallery selects an artist to create an original work to don the event poster and invitation. This year’s artist is John Yoyogi Fortes. His painting, _Sweet 16_ will be auctioned off at the event.

Representing Northern California artists, the SFMOMA Artists Gallery offers a diverse selection of original artwork for sale and rent. Visit our website at [www.sfmoma.org](https://www.sfmoma.org) or call 415.441.4777 for more information.
