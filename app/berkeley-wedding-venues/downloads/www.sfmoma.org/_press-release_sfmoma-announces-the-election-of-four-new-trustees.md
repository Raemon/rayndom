SAN FRANCISCO, CA (November 20, 2020) — The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) announces the election of four new Trustees and one Artist Trustee to its Board of Trustees during 2020.

Ivette Caldera Esserman and Sir Deryck Maughan were elected at the March Board of Trustees meeting. Ty Ahmad-Taylor was elected at the October meeting and Tyson Clark was elected at the November meeting of the Board. Each will serve a three-year term, effective immediately. The new trustees bring substantial experience in business, philanthropy, collecting, creativity and technology to the museum.

In addition, Hung Liu joined the Board of Trustees in March as Artist Trustee serving for a three-year term. She joins Julie Mehretu and Rosana Castrillo Díaz in this important advisory role for SFMOMA.

**Sir Deryck Maughan**

Sir Deryck Maughan was a Partner of KKR, a leading private equity firm. He served as Vice Chairman of Citigroup and CEO of Citigroup International. Prior to that, Maughan was Chairman and CEO of Salomon Brothers and worked at H.M. Treasury and Goldman Sachs.

Maughan served as Vice Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange and as a member of an Advisory Committee of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. He is a former Senior Independent Director of GlaxoSmithKline and a Director and member of the Executive Committee of BlackRock.

Maughan is a Harkness Fellow and a graduate of King’s College London and the Graduate School of Business, Stanford University. He was knighted by the Queen in 2002.

**Hung Liu**

Born in China in 1948, Hung Liu grew up during the war, famine and perpetual revolution of the Maoist era before immigrating to the United States in 1984. Known primarily as a painter, she challenges the documentary authority of historical photographs by subjecting them to the more reflective process of painting. Much of the meaning of her paintings comes from the way the washes and drips dissolve the photo-based images, suggesting the passage of memory into history.

A two-time recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in painting, Hung Liu has also received a Lifetime Achievement Award in Printmaking from the Southern Graphics Council International in 2011. A travelling career retrospective of Liu’s work, _Summoning Ghosts: The Art of Hung Liu_ , was organized by the Oakland Museum of California in 2013. In a review of the retrospective, the Wall Street Journal called Liu “the greatest Chinese painter in the U.S.” Liu’s works have been exhibited extensively and collected by SFMOMA; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the San Jose Museum of Art; the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Kansas City; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the Asian Art Museum, San Francisco; and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, among others. She currently lives in Oakland, California, and is Professor Emerita at Mills College where she has taught since 1990.

### Elected in October 2020

**Ty Ahmad-Taylor**

As Vice President of Business Product Marketing at Facebook, Ty Ahmad-Taylor leads the company’s monetization strategy and global go-to-market efforts for products that connect people and businesses on the platform. Prior to Facebook, Ahmad-Taylor most recently served as CEO of THX Ltd., a global media and entertainment company that provides high-end audio-video experiences in cinemas, the Consumer Electronics industry, in-home and large outdoor venues. He brings to Facebook 25+ years of information design, 20+ years of both consumer-facing software and product development leadership, as well as interactive television services development experience. He also has a diverse portfolio of technology and hardware patents and has held roles at several startups and large media and consumer electronic companies, including Viacom, Comcast, The New York Times and Samsung.

### Elected in November 2020

**Tyson Clark**

Tyson Clark is a general partner at GV (formerly Google Ventures). He spent his career in enterprise technology, focusing on companies in the SaaS application and data center infrastructure spaces. Prior to joining GV, Clark was a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, where he was on the corporate development team and advised enterprise portfolio companies. He led acquisitions in the enterprise SaaS space for Oracle’s corporate development group, and before that worked as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley, where he oversaw IPO and M&A transactions for a variety of enterprise cloud companies. Clark began his career in the United States Navy, serving on submarines as both a nuclear propulsion officer and Navy scuba diver.

Outside of work, Clark is passionate about youth education and enrichment in underserved communities in the U.S., and ensuring critical medical care for the poor in impoverished countries abroad. He serves on the Board of two non-profits, SummerSearch and ReSurge.

Clark holds a BS in industrial engineering from Stanford University and an MBA from Harvard Business School.
