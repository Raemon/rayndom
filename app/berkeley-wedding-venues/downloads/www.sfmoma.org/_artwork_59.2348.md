_SFX: Theramin, setting strange and dreamy mood_

NARRATOR:

What _is_ that thing? A looming spaceship? A water tower?

_SFX: fades into birds chirping, sounds of nature waking up at dawn._

SARAH ROBERTS: 

It’s an eyeball. It’s part of a ship. Part of an automobile. 

CAITLIN HASKELL: 

Grain elevator, I don’t know

NARRATOR: 

It’s a painting that makes even curators wonder. 

ROBERTS: 

I’ve never had an answer that made perfect sense to me, and I can think of a hundred different things that it could be. 

NARRATOR: 

But why would Arthur Dove paint a landscape, and then block so much of the view? Artist Leslie Shows knows a lot about landscapes, and she loves this painting. Let’s ask her.

LESLIE SHOWS:

To me the heart of this painting is the reflection, I think it’s so beautiful there is something about mirroring and reflection that seems really profound to me. And it kind of, in a certain way to me, speaks to … almost like a consciousness observing the world and the world looking back, there is sort of a beholder and beheld and they’re regarding each other.
