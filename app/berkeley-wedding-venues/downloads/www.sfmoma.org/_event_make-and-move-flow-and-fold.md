Get in the game through Make and Move, a series of programs that blend movement with art making to explore the intersections of sports, arts, and culture. 

Start the new year with intention by blending movement and creativity through the meditative practice of yoga and the delicate art of origami.

From 2–7 p.m., drop in for the soothing, hands-on experience of creating origami, learning about the rich cultural history behind this intricate art form. Origami artist Linda Mihara will guide participants through folding techniques and designs, perfect for all skill levels. Together, these practices create a space for reflection, patience, and artistic expression — a mindful way to launch into the year ahead. All materials will be provided, so just bring yourself and a willingness to unwind and create! 

Join us for two 75-minute mindful yoga flows at 4 p.m. and 6 p.m., led by experienced instructors, to help center your body and focus your mind.
