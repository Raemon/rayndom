**Members see it first!** Don’t miss an early chance to see the first-ever U.S. survey of Kunié Sugiura’s bold hybrid practice. Immerse yourself in works spanning the artist’s 60+ year career, reflecting her bicultural identity and blending mediums like photography, painting, and sculpture. Any member with an interest in photography or mixed-media art will not want to miss this exhibition!

_Kunié Sugiura: Photopainting_ is included in general admission and does not require special tickets.

In addition to our regular member preview hours, guests at [Art Bash](https://www.sfmoma.org/event/series/art-bash/) on April 23 will be able to enjoy a sneak peek of the exhibition.
