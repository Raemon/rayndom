The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) is proud to present the Carole and Robert McNeil Volunteer Recognition Award 2002 to Museum docents Cathy Kalin and Eva Klein.

**Cathy Kalin, Children’s Docent**  
Cathy Kalin, a resident of San Francisco, has been a Children’s Docent at SFMOMA since 1990. She has held several leadership positions over the past several years, including President of the Docent Council, Family Day Coordinator, Children’s Representative and Children’s Docent Mentor. Her popular tours of the SFMOMA collection have been highly acclaimed by students and teachers alike.

Kalin conducts regular _Look, Learn, Create_ tours, a major resource for teachers and elementary students of public and private schools in the Bay Area. The two-part program begins with a classroom visit by an SFMOMA docent, followed by a trip to the Museum that includes gallery viewing and hands-on art projects in the galleries. The goal of _Look, Learn, Create_ is to encourage children to embark on a lifelong habit of art exploration.

As Family Day Coordinator for the docent-led activities, Kalin helped to organize many of the bi-annual daylong celebrations, which include hands-on art projects, gallery activities, music and performances. The next Family Day will take place at SFMOMA on June 16, 2002.

**Eva Klein, Adult Docent**  
Eva Klein, a Hillsborough resident, has been an SFMOMA Adult Docent since 1989 and the docent _Art & Conversation_ coordinator since 1995. _Art & Conversation_ is a free monthly program for seniors and other visitors that offers lectures by curators and artists on the permanent collection and special exhibitions. Recent lectures have included _A Conversation with Jack Stauffacher_ and _Making Multimedia the SFMOMA Way_.

As an Adult Docent, Klein creates and conducts Public Tours of SFMOMA’s permanent collection highlighting esteemed works of painting and sculpture, drawing, photography and media arts. She also leads popular tours of SFMOMA’s many temporary exhibitions.  
Klein is an active member of the Media Arts Study Group, which meets regularly to discuss the latest movements and trends in this burgeoning medium. Recently topics have included SFMOMA’s groundbreaking exhibitions _Bill Viola_ and _010101: Art in Technological Times_.

As docents, both Kalin and Klein receive professional training uniquely suited to working with adults, children, teenagers and families. In addition to the nine-month intensive study period, docents participate in ongoing training that includes gallery walk-throughs with Museum curators and workshops on specific exhibition topics.

Both Kalin and Klein will apply the McNeil Volunteer Recognition Award money to SFMOMA’s varied education programs.
