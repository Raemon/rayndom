> “The artist known for her portraits of Michelle Obama and Breonna Taylor is showing how much else she can do.”  
>  — _The New York Times_

_Amy Sherald: American Sublime_ invites you to breathe. Come and be taken in by the colors, shapes, and forms painted by one of America’s defining contemporary portraitists. 

This exhibition presents nearly 50 of Amy Sherald’s luminous paintings, including her iconic portraits of Michelle Obama and Breonna Taylor, poetic early works, and new works on view for the first time. 

Sherald’s artworks convey the quiet power in everyday people and invite viewers to participate in a more complex debate about accepted notions of American identity.

> “I really have this deep belief that images can change the world.”
> 
> — Amy Sherald

In the spirit of great American artists like Edward Hopper, Alice Neel, and Kerry James Marshall, Sherald’s works reframe our understanding of American culture. _American Sublime_ is organized thematically, with each gallery presenting a crucial idea in her work and explaining her detailed approach to making paintings.

### _Amy Sherald: American Sublime_ Exhibition Catalogue

_Amy Sherald: American Sublime_ unfolds her method of selecting individuals she meets on the street and using facial expression, body language, and clothing choices to create paintings that transcend portraiture and expand the canon of American art. Essays by curators Sarah Roberts and Rhea Combs; poet and writer Elizabeth Alexander; artist Dario Calmese; and renowned scholar Deborah Willis contextualize and illuminate Sherald’s creation of a new form of imaginative portraiture.
