Yuri Suzuki’s _Arborhythm_ invites you to sit and stay awhile, taking in a soothing soundtrack of San Francisco’s natural and urban sounds. This experiential artwork was commissioned in concert with the exhibition [_Art of Noise_](https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/art-of-noise/). 

The treelike speakers (that inspired the artwork’s title) play a continually remixed soundtrack of field recordings captured from around and beyond the city. The sculpture’s bright colors recall Bay Area sunsets and landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge. “My public art projects always ask to make space more alive,” Suzuki says. 

By tuning and layering the sounds of our local environment into a sensorial soundscape, Suzuki aims to “replenish people’s attention through their unconscious, cognitive process and help them relax and de-stress.”
