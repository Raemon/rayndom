Get in the game through Make and Move, a series of programs that blend movement with art making to explore the intersections of sports, arts, and culture. 

In this program, we’ll find the connection between soccer and fashion. _Get in the Game_ artist **Jasko Begovic (Sko Habibi)** will be joined by collaborators **Asaad Bruno** , **Dania Cabello** , **Arjuna Sayyed** , and **Max Ornstil** , who all share a dual passion for soccer and expression through textiles. Test out your soccer skills and gather pointers for play as Cabello and Ornstil offer a series of relays that explore the basics of soccer. Plus, get hands-on with Begovic and Bruno’s art practices, which focus on textiles, stitching, embroidery, and more. You’ll have the opportunity to experiment with these techniques on various textiles in a self-guided format. At 7 p.m., a special closing performance will invite you to learn about freestyle soccer and join in on this form of self-expression.

#### Schedule

4–7 p.m. | **Drop-in making and moving**

7 p.m. | **Freestyle with Dania and Max**
