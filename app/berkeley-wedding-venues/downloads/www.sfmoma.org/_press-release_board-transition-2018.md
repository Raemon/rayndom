SAN FRANCISCO, CA (May 31, 2018) — The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) today announced a major leadership transition on its Board of Trustees. Charles R. Schwab, who has served as Board Chair since 2007, will be succeeded as Chair by Robert J. Fisher, who previously served as President. Diana L. Nelson will assume the role of President from her current role as Vice Chair and Charles M. Collins will assume the role of Vice Chair. These changes will be effective as of July 1, 2018. Fisher and Nelson currently serve as Trustee Advisors to the museum’s five-year strategic planning project.

“The museum board has selected new leadership whom I know embrace the thrill and innovation of modern and contemporary art, and how it can help everyone see the world in fresh new ways,” said Charles Schwab.

“Chuck has been a tremendous role model, leader and friend for the past decade. His enthusiasm, support and commitment have taken us from a very good museum to one thriving on the global stage,” said Robert Fisher. “He leaves big shoes to fill, and I hope I can add to his legacy as the next Chair of SFMOMA, as well as continue the dedication and love of the institution that began with my parents.” 

Additionally, the museum announced the appointment of Julie Mehretu to the Board of Trustees as Artist Trustee. Mehretu joins artists Rosana Castrillo Díaz and Jeff Wall as Artist Trustees serving three-year terms. In 2017, Mehretu’s monumental commission HOWL, _eon_ (I, II) went on display in the museum’s Walter and Evelyn Haas, Jr. Atrium.

Collectors Vicki and Kent Logan, who have given SFMOMA over 330 works since 1997, including pieces by some of the most important artists of our time as well as works by young emerging artists, join the Board as Honorary Trustees. In 2012–13, the museum presented an exhibition featuring highlights from the Logans’ gift, entitled _Don’t Be Shy, Don’t Hold Back: The Logan Collection at SFMOMA_.

Kathryn A. Hall, Gina Peterson and Komal Shah will also join the museum’s Board of Trustees as of July 1, 2018.

“It has been an honor and a pleasure to work with Chuck Schwab for the past 10 years. From his spearheading two capital campaigns, his oversight of our endowment, leadership of our board and his thoughtful participation on countless board committees, to the impact that he and Helen have had on our collection through their very generous gifts of important works of art, it’s hard to imagine something that Chuck hasn’t touched at SFMOMA,” said Neal Benezra, the Helen and Charles Schwab Director of SFMOMA. “His collegial, warm and engaging nature encouraged participation and created a gravitational pull that attracted terrific people to participate in SFMOMA. Bob and Diana are key leaders in the next generation of the cultural life of San Francisco, and will continue the great work that was begun by Chuck. We are so fortunate to have this depth of exceptional leadership at our institution.”

### The Schwab Legacy  


With over 30 years of enthusiastic support for SFMOMA as a donor, lender and art lover, Charles Schwab has served as Board Chair since July 2007 and led the institution through a decade of major growth and expansion culminating in the opening of the newly expanded museum on May 14, 2016. Serving as chairperson of SFMOMA’s Expansion Campaign, Schwab led the effort to raise over $610 million to fund the building’s construction costs, fortify its endowment and cover operational expenses for three years of temporary closure. Supported by 100 percent participation by the museum’s trustees, the campaign’s endowment provides free admission for all visitors aged 18 and younger in perpetuity. Schwab served as chair of the architecture selection committee that chose internationally renowned architecture firm Snøhetta to design the museum’s expansion. A new 460,000 square-foot addition nearly tripled the museum’s galleries and provided new education, performance and administrative spaces, making SFMOMA the largest museum of modern and contemporary art in the United States. In its first year in the expanded space, the museum welcomed over 1.2 million visitors.

Schwab’s involvement in SFMOMA was not limited to the museum’s physical expansion. In 2009, working closely with Don and Doris Fisher, Schwab was instrumental in crafting the museum’s landmark partnership with the Fisher family to bring the renowned Fisher Collection’s 1,100 works to SFMOMA through an innovative century-long agreement, presenting the collection to the public in spacious, specially designed galleries in the new expansion. During his tenure, the museum’s multiyear Campaign for Art also garnered over 3,000 exceptional works, which were gifted by collectors around the globe to strengthen and expand SFMOMA’s permanent collection. Schwab and his wife Helen provided lead gifts of artworks by Jackson Pollock, Vija Celmins, Francis Bacon, Jasper Johns, Brice Marden, Pablo Picasso and Chuck Close.

Schwab’s contributions to SFMOMA have been numerous in scale and scope, ranging from named positions and spaces, and exhibition sponsorships to accessions support. In 2016, the Schwabs endowed the Helen and Charles Schwab Director position currently held by Neal Benezra. They also endowed Helen and Charles Schwab Hall in the expanded museum, creating a new central gathering space for visitors in the museum’s free zone.

Schwab will remain on the board as a Trustee and will continue to chair the museum’s Investment Committee.

Robert Fisher and Diana Nelson will transition to their new roles as Board Chair and President, respectively, on July 1, 2018. Among their immediate projects will be the rollout in fall 2018 of the new five-year strategic plan that will determine the museum’s institutional priorities.
