The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) Artists Gallery will hold its annual Artists Warehouse Sale from Wednesday, May 3, through Sunday, May 7, 2006, at San Francisco’s Fort Mason Center, Building A. The benefit is one of the Bay Area’s most anticipated annual art events, and this year’s sale promises to be bigger and better than ever, offering more art—paintings, photographs, and sculptures—in an expanded space, and a separate gallery space just for prints and works on paper. Among the more than 400 West Coast artists whose work will be represented are Jamie Brunson, Willard Dixon, Tony Ligamari, Daniel McClain, Gustavo Rivera, and Inez Storer. All artworks are 50 percent off regular retail price. Sale proceeds benefit the programs of the SFMOMA Artists Gallery, which supports both the Museum and regional artists. **This event is free and open to the public.**

The sale begins with a grand opening reception on Wednesday, May 3, from 6 to 9 p.m., featuring complimentary wine and live music by the all-female Cajun band the Cajun Belles. The final day of the sale closes with live jazz in the afternoon by the Roger Tuan Ensemble. During the week of the sale, the gallery will offer special extended hours:

**  
Wednesday, May 3  
  
6–9 p.m. (Gala reception with music and refreshments)**

Thursday, May 4  
  
Noon–8 p.m.

Friday, May 5  
  
Noon–8 p.m.

Saturday, May 6  
  
Noon–5:30 p.m.

Sunday, May 7  
  
Noon–4 p.m.

Although the gallery restocks sale works daily, visitors are encouraged to attend early for the best selection.

Established in 1978, the SFMOMA Artists Gallery represents more than 1,300 emerging and established West Coast artists and mounts 11 exhibitions each year, including solo exhibitions, group and theme shows, and occasional career retrospectives for mature artists. The gallery offers exposure and support to regional artists while providing seasoned collectors, corporate clients, and art-world newcomers alike an affordable way to enjoy original artwork.<
