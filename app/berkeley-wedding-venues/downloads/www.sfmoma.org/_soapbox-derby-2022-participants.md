Sculptor Richard Shaw is returning to Shelley Drive once again and bringing some conspirators along for the ride in Martha Shaw, Whitney Shaw-Brandborg, Gregor Weiss, and Torin Brandborg. Richard Shaw’s famed pencil-shaped derby car won “Fastest Looking” in the museum’s 1975 race and inspired several participants in the 2022 derby.

Jon Spring is a lifelong Bay Area artist who has worked undercover at SFMOMA since 2009. While his colleagues think he works in the finance department un-ironically, his day-to-day practice is “a trenchant critique of the post-modern art-industrial complex.” 

The LAST Car ****

“We are the Shawborg. Together We Create,” is the derby motto for artists Torin Brandborg, Whitney Shaw, and Alice Shaw. The trio will be racing in this derby along with the Shaw-Weiss team, proving that the derby sport runs in the family. 

The Wide Awakes ****

The Wide Awakes is an open-network coalition of artists and creatives that mobilize communities in the fight for equity. Represented by longtime collaborators Hank Willis Thomas, Helen Banach, and Smilee Barnacle, the coalition adopted its name from the Lincoln-era youth-led movement group fighting slavery and oppression in the 1860s. 

Tight Quarters ****

Established in 2013 under the name Little Lodge, Tight Quarters is an artist collective and gallery space located in San Francisco’s Inner Sunset neighborhood. Its members can be seen at local pop-up shops, with prints, beanies, and abundant artworks.

In his youth, Robert van de Walle rebelled against “Orange County’s car-centric, homogenous, bland suburbs” by building bike-powered and gravity-powered contraptions. Now, with his team at Three Feet of Air productions, he creates works that reflect his fascination with “our unresolvable desires to both celebrate wild spaces and pave the world.”
