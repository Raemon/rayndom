**_New Work: Mary Lovelace O’Neal_**

March 16–October 20, 2024

Floor 4

Over her 60-year practice, Mary Lovelace O’Neal has experimented with materials, color and the relationship between abstraction and figuration. Her paintings allude to a vast mythology of personal and shared narratives, from her beloved dachshund Tillie to her involvement in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Her early works from the 1960s utilized lampblack pigment—powdered soot created from burning oil, which she rubbed and pushed into her canvases. Lovelace O’Neal used this technique to address three subjects at the fore of art and culture at that moment, which she describes as “surface flatness, black as a color, and blackness as an existential, racial experience.” The artist would then go into the velvety black expanses with materials including paint, gasoline and glitter, introducing imagination and play. In time, representational elements emerged from her abstractions, offering new narrative possibilities within a constellation of references across music, literature and social movements.

In 1979, she was hired at the University of California, Berkeley, where she became the first African American professor awarded tenure in the Department of Art Practice in 1985, then chair of the department in 1999, and professor emerita in 2006. Lovelace O’Neal now splits her time between Oakland and Mérida, Mexico, where the works in the exhibition were made. Although Lovelace O’Neal’s recent paintings begin with a black ground, color remains foundational to her practice. As she has explained, “Painting with color was always a surprise. [It was] like dancing with the paint.”

Significant support for _New Work: Mary Lovelace O’Neal_ is provided by Mary Jane Elmore, Deborah and Kenneth Novack, and Robin Wright and Ian Reeves. Meaningful support is provided by Alka and Ravin Agrawal, Jessica and Matt Farron, Adriane Iann and Christian Stolz, and Gary Steele and Steven Rice.

**_Creative Growth: The House That Art Built_**

April 6–October 6, 2024

Floor 2

_Creative Growth: The House That Art Built_ celebrates the 50th anniversary of the first organization in the United States dedicated to supporting artists with developmental disabilities. Today, more than 140 artists work at the organization, using every medium, from painting and drawing to ceramics, wood, fiber, digital media and printmaking. This exhibition features a selection from the museum’s recent acquisition of work by Creative Growth artists—Josef Alef, Camille Holvoet, Susan Janow, Dwight Mackintosh, John Martin, Dan Miller, Donald Mitchell, Judith Scott, William Scott, Ron Veasey and Alice Wong—along with archival material that highlights the organization’s history. Together, the exhibition and historic acquisition present the vitality of creative production by these artists and demonstrate their impact on cultural dialogues in the Bay Area and beyond.

Lead support for _Creative Growth: The House That Art Built_ is provided by Randi and Bob Fisher and Diana Nelson and John Atwater. Major support is provided by Mary Jo and Dick Kovacevich. Significant support is provided by Mary Jane Elmore. Meaningful support is provided by Martin and Rebecca Eisenberg, Maryellen and Frank Herringer, and Alison Pincus.

**_Praise Frisco: Peace and Love in the City_**

April 6–October 6, 2024

Floor 2

SFMOMA presents a major commission by Creative Growth artist William Scott this spring for the museum’s _Bay Area Walls_ series, site-responsive wall projects by local artists that actively engage with pressing issues of our time. Scott’s largest painting to date, the large-scale commission merges two of his abiding interests: map-like renderings of San Francisco and portraits of the people who populate his life and dreams. Scott and his mother, for example, appear as youthful versions of themselves, smiling alongside members of their church and the musician Diana Ross. In the background is the Alice Griffith public housing development near the city’s Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood, where the artist was raised. Scott’s realism expresses hopefulness and fantasy, culminating in a monumental celebration of “Praise Frisco,” his name for the new San Francisco he envisions for the future.

_Praise Frisco: Peace and Love in the City_ was commissioned and executed by William Scott as a part of _Bay Area Walls,_ a series of commissions initiated in 2020. Major support is provided by the Roberta and Steve Denning Commissioning Endowed Fund. Significant support is provided by the Diana Nelson and John Atwater Commissioning Fund. Meaningful support is provided by the Patricia W. Fitzpatrick Commissioning Endowed Fund and the Denise Littlefield Sobel Commissioning Endowed Fund.

**_Art of Noise_**

May 4–August 18, 2024

Floor 7

_Art of Noise_ celebrates groundbreaking design that has shaped our relationship with music over the last century. From concert posters to record albums, phonographs to digital music players, handheld radios to hi-fis, the exhibition illustrates the evolving aesthetics of design that have given form and color to sound. Drawn largely from SFMOMA’s collection, the exhibition covers the Floor 7 galleries with a staggering 800 artworks: posters, flyers, album covers, design objects and large-scale installations that merge inventive design and audio.

Unforgettable album covers, flamboyant posters and eye-catching flyers demonstrate the ability of successful graphic design to provide a visual accompaniment to our experiences with audio. _Art of Noise_ offers the opportunity to present hundreds of stunning works from SFMOMA’s trove of psychedelic rock posters of the 1960s and ’70s for the first time.

Designed in collaboration with teenage engineering, the exhibition follows milestones in technical design that have radically transformed how, where and when consumers can listen to music, as well as unique and experimental works that challenge ideas of portability and functionality. Visitors are also invited into audio installations designed for communal listening by teenage engineering, outdoor sonic seating by Yuri Suzuki and an ultra-high-fidelity sound system by Devon Turnbull.

Major support for _Art of Noise_ is provided by Mary Jo and Dick Kovacevich, The Bernard Osher Foundation, and the Bernard and Barbro Osher Exhibition Fund. Significant support is provided by Deborah and Kenneth Novack. Meaningful support is provided by Sonya Yu.

**Yayoi Kusama: Dreaming of Earth’s Sphericity, I Would Offer My Love**

June 22, 2024–January 2025

Floor 6

After its inclusion in the museum’s presentation _Yayoi Kusama: Infinite Love_ , closing on May 28, Kusama’s single Infinity Mirror Room _Dreaming of Earth’s Sphericity, I Would Offer My Love_ (2023) will reopen without surcharge on June 22. The newest of the artist’s acclaimed Infinity Mirror Rooms, it welcomes the viewer into a universe of multicolored light. At first, the exterior of this sculptural work blends into the gallery’s all-white surroundings, punctuated by an array of large transparent acrylic dots, including a quadrant—or quarter-dot—door at one corner for visitors to enter. In the interior, bright ambient light filters through the colored windows to create a luminous, kaleidoscopic pattern of overlapping circles. As visitors turn around in the space, the mirrored surfaces create an environment that is constantly in flux.

Major support for _Yayoi Kusama: Dreaming of Earth’s Sphericity, I Would Offer My Love_ is provided by Stephanie and Mark Robinson. Generous support is provided by Jonathan Heiliger and Germaine Yokoyama-Heiliger and W.L.S. Spencer Foundation. Meaningful support is provided by Alka and Ravin Agrawal, Dolly and George Chammas, Marielle Ednalino and Ken Lamb, Frances Hellman and Warren Breslau, the Pincus Family, and the Sanger Family Foundation.

_Kara E-Walker_  
July 1, 2024–May 2026

Floor 1

With an imagination fueled by rage, sorrow and compassion, Walker has extended her practice beyond her signature cut-paper silhouettes and drawings to include monumental installations that challenge the narratives that are commemorated and memorialized institutionally by the state, museum and church. For her SFMOMA commission—the first site-specific installation for its admission-free ground floor Roberts Family Gallery—Walker will create a large-scale installation that responds to the glass-enclosed gallery space and plays with strategies of engagement and preservation inspired by historical museum displays.

Major support for _Fortuna and the Immortality Garden (Machine)_ is provided by Roberta and Steve Denning Commissioning Endowed Fund and Sir Deryck and Lady Va Maughan. Significant support is provided by Mary Jane Elmore, Agnes Gund, Diana Nelson and John Atwater Commissioning Fund, Deborah and Kenneth Novack, and Sonja Hoel Perkins and Jonathan Perkins. Meaningful support is provided by Alka and Ravin Agrawal, Jessica and Matt Farron, Patricia W. Fitzpatrick Commissioning Endowed Fund, Sheri and Paul Siegel Exhibition Fund, and Denise Littlefield Sobel Commissioning Endowed Fund. Exhibition production meaningfully supported by Kvadrat.
