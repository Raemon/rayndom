SAN FRANCISCO—The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) announces the appointment of Ed Lamberger as its new Chief Human Resources Officer. In this role, Lamberger will oversee all aspects of human resource management at the museum including the creation and implementation of human resources policies and practices, and will serve as a member of SFMOMA’s senior staff.

“With deep experience in human resources and involvement in the community through volunteer roles with several mission-driven organizations, Ed Lamberger is a crucial addition to our team,” said Neal Benezra, SFMOMA director. “His interpersonal relations skills and enthusiasm for SFMOMA are extraordinary, and we are thrilled to welcome him onboard at such a pivotal time, as we look towards our opening in spring 2016.”

Lamberger brings exceptional experience in all areas of human resources, with a strong emphasis on designing and managing performance development and compensation programs. Prior to SFMOMA, Lamberger held significant positions at Macy’s over the course of 31 years, most recently Vice President, Human Resources, Northwest Region. In this role, he oversaw human resources for an employee population of 17,000 across eight states, and was instrumental in managing change through Macy’s various acquisitions and restructures. Recognized as a motivator and a mentor, his leadership enabled Macy’s to achieve its goals through strategic talent management and successful business partnerships.

Furthering his commitment to the community, Lamberger served as the Board Chair from 2011 through 2013 for Project Open Hand, a San Francisco-based non-profit organization that provides meals and nutrition services for seniors and the critically ill. He holds degrees in Business Administration and Psychology from Linfield College.
