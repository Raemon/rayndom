Artist Consuelo Kanaga passionately photographed both renowned and lesser-known Black figures throughout her career. Her commitments to social justice and workers’ rights brought her into contact with many Black organizers and laborers between the 1930s and 1950s. These individuals, like Kanaga, led extraordinary lives with expansive careers. Historian **Dr. Robin D. G. Kelley** , in conversation with Assistant Curator of Photography **Delphine Sims** , will delve into the stories behind many of the people Kanaga photographed. Dr. Kelley will discuss the politics of race and labor in Kanaga’s artwork, exploring her complex relationship with the Black working class and Black social movements. Kanaga created thoughtful and beautiful portraits; Dr. Kelley will guide us through how these pictures reflect a collaboration between a talented photographer and her impactful, multifaceted sitters. Join us to discover the lives of Kanaga and figures such as Eluard Luchell McDaniel, Annie Mae Merriweather, and Angelo Herndon, among others.
