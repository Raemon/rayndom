Explore the legacy of Group f.64, a collective of 11 Bay Area photographers who, in 1932, organized around a simple aim: to make photographs that rivaled paintings. Tonight, hear more about the group and its influence on subsequent generations from the Curator and Head of Photography at SFMOMA, **Erin O’Toole**. **Janet Delaney, Zig Jackson,** and **Ray Potes,** three artists featured in the exhibition _Around Group f.64: Legacies and Counterhistories in Bay Area Photography,_ will then discuss their practices, exploring how their unique perspectives and creative approaches have expanded upon that tradition or subverted it.

### About the Speakers

**Janet Delaney** is a fine art photographer whose work explores the social and political dynamics of urban life. Her books include _South of Market_ (2013), documenting a 1980s San Francisco neighborhood; _Public Matters_ (2018), capturing public life during the Reagan era; and _Red Eye to New York_ (2021), portraying 1980s Manhattan. She is currently working on a sequel to _South of Market_ , focusing on tech’s impact on her former neighborhood, and a new book, _Too Many Products, Too Much Pressure_ , about her father’s life as a mid-20th-century Los Angeles salesman. Delaney received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2020 and three NEA grants. Her work is held in major institutions including SFMOMA, the de Young Museum, the Museum of the City of New York, and the High Museum. She has exhibited widely in the US and abroad. Delaney earned her MFA from the San Francisco Art Institute and taught at UC Berkeley. She lives and works in Berkeley.

**Zig Jackson** grew up in the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota and began photographing while attending a high school for Indigenous children in Utah. Jackson’s conceptual, black-and-white photographs employ humor to address the geopolitics of settler colonialism and challenge misconceptions of Indigenous peoples as a vanishing community. Jackson received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2021 and the Beaumont Newhall Award for Photographic Excellence in 2015. His teaching career includes positions at Mount Holyoke College, Michigan State University, and the Savannah College of Art and Design.

**Ray Potes** has been shooting photos and making zines since age 14. Today he edits and publishes _Hamburger Eyes_ Photo Magazine. Publishing since 2001, _Hamburger Eyes_ is inspired by the traditions that began with _National Geographic_ and _LIFE Magazine_ and hopes to revitalize the sensation of photography as a craft as well as a tool to record and document. Hamburger Eyes has produced over 200 titles of zines, magazines, and books alongside countless exhibitions, commissions, and collaborations of all shapes and sizes.
