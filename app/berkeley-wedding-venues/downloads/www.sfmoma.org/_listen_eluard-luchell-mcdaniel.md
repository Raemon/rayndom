Eluard Luchell McDaniel, the subject of this portrait, was born in Mississippi around 1912. He arrived in 1931 in San Francisco, where he met Kanaga, who welcomed him into her home and helped him return to school. He worked as her driver, darkroom assistant, and household help. These were just some of many roles McDaniel assumed during his illustrious and radical life. He later became affiliated with the Communist Party and Bay Area labor activities, including the 1934 West Coast longshoremen’s strike, and he traveled to Alabama to work with the Share Croppers’ Union.
