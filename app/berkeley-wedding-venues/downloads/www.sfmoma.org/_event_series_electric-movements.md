_Electric Movements_ presents a series of live programs fusing technology and the performing arts. The electrifying performances feature an international and multigenerational group of artists who incorporate technological tools into their experimental practices and creative processes. From the use of artificial intelligence, wearable interfaces, and interactive media to early computer programs, experience innovative works that intersect the digital with sound, movement, and theater to offer a vivid look at the boundary-pushing, evolving future of performance.
