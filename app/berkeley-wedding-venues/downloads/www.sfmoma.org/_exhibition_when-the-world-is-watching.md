> “For me, there was no use having such a big platform if I wasn’t going to use it for good.”  
>  — Megan Rapinoe, pro soccer player 2009–23

Major international competitions where athletes compete as members of a national team are highly anticipated and widely watched media events. Such tournaments find participants facing their fiercest competitors, and often befriending them. Host cities invest in building state-of-the-art arenas, transportation, and hospitality to increase tourism. Nations finance research and development of performance sports gear, like the racing wheelchair and hydrofoil sailboat on view here, which in turn influence the sporting goods made available to the public. Given the global attention, many athletes take the opportunity to surface inequities they have encountered for broader perspectives and debate. In addition to showcasing the highest level of performance, international games spur innovations in design and urban planning, and significant discussions that influence broader social progress.
