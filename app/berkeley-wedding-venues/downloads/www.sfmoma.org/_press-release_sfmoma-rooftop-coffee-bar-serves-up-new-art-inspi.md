The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) is pleased to offer some new art-inspired desserts at the museum’s Rooftop Coffee Bar for the holidays. Baked and decorated by Blue Bottle Coffee Co. pastry chef Caitlin Williams Freeman, these treats are a tasty way to enjoy the museum’s collection and special exhibitions throughout the year.

New on offer for the holidays is the **Cragg Cone** , an upside down ice cream cone with Humphry Slocombe malted milk chocolate and pumpkin five-spice ice cream served in a brown sugar cone with a custom cone wrapper inspired by Tony Cragg’s sculpture _Guglie_(1987), which is on view in the Rooftop Garden. Also new on the menu is the **Rooftop Garden Cookie Plate**. Served on a custom-printed napkin that serves as a guide to each cookie, the dish features five bite-size cookies, including a white coconut sable triangle inspired by Alexander Calder’s __ sculpture _Big Crinkly_ (1969); a black cocoa sable dot cookie inspired by Calder’s _Four Big Dots_ sculpture _;_ two gingko leaf–shaped cookies made of matcha green tea, saffron, and graham cracker sables; and a “Where’s Waldo” red-and-white striped vanilla icebox cookie.

Always on the menu are the popular **Mondrian Cake,** made of vanilla and red velvet cake with chocolate ganache; **Frida Kahlo Mexican Wedding Cookies** , featuring walnut Mexican wedding cookies in a hand-printed box with a printed ribbon; and the **Thiebaud Cake** , a chocolate cake with vanilla butter cream and chocolate ganache.

The Rooftop Coffee Bar also serves espresso, macchiato, cappuccino, caffè latte, caffè mocha, and affogatto, prepared using an ornate espresso machine from Amsterdam and presented in custom-designed cups by Heath Ceramics. The menu also includes New Orleans–style iced coffee, hot chocolate, tea, apple juice, lemonade, and bottled water. The Rooftop Coffee Bar features products from local vendors, including milk from Clover Organic Farms, chocolate from Recchiuti, and Humphry Slocombe ice cream.

The Rooftop Coffee Bar is open daily (except Wednesdays) from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., and open late on Thursdays until 8 p.m.
