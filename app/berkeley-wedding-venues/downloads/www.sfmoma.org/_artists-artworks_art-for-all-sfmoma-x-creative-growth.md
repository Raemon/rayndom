**Celebrating Fifty Years**  
SFMOMA and [Creative Growth Art Center](https://creativegrowth.org/) honor the emergence of the art and disability movement in the Bay Area through an unprecedented partnership. Commemorating Creative Growth’s fiftieth anniversary, this partnership includes the acquisition of 100+ works into SFMOMA’s permanent collection, two exhibitions, and a three-year series of events. Highlights include the fifth annual Creating Community symposium on Thursday, May 23, 2024, and the 50th Anniversary Gala and Beyond Trend Fashion Show in September 2024, featuring original designs by Creative Growth artists.
