After a three-year run at SFMOMA, _Ragnar Kjartansson: The Visitors_ will close at the end of September. **On Sunday, September 21,[members](https://www.sfmoma.org/membership/) can enjoy a day of exclusive access** to spend time with this mesmerizing hour-long video work before it goes.

To manage access to this beloved installation and ensure a comfortable gallery experience, **members must reserve advance tickets for the September 21 viewing hours.** Members may reserve tickets for an A.M. window (10 a.m.–1 p.m.) or P.M. window (1–4 p.m.) and may remain in the gallery for as long as they would like during these time blocks. Tickets for _The Visitors_ will also give members access to the rest of the museum.
