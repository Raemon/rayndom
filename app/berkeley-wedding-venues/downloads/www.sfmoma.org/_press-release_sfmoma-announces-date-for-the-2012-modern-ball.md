The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) is thrilled to announce the date of the 2012 Modern Ball, the museum’s largest gala fundraiser. The grand celebration will be held on Wednesday, April 25, 2012, and chaired by SFMOMA Trustee Dolly Chammas. This year’s honorary chairs are Helen and Charles Schwab.

The __ Modern Ball will again be held at the museum, with the soaring, five-story Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Atrium as the center of activity. The multifaceted gala features two concurrent events: **The Gala Dinner** , a five-star meal with a live auction and entertainment; and **The Supper Club** , a hip and stylish lounge offering a fabulous buffet dinner, dancing, and music, as well as a scintillating social scene. Guests will then converge with additional revelers at **The Post-Modern Party** , a museum-wide fete featuring live and DJ entertainment that continues to the wee hours of the evening. Event designer Stanlee Gatti will transform the museum into a dazzling party space with surprises around every corner.

Tickets for both the Modern Ball and The Post-Modern Party will be available at a range of levels. Details will be announced in late fall. 

Proceeds from The Modern Ball enable SFMOMA to provide over 50,000 students, teachers, and families with free access to teacher training programs, docent-led tours for children, after-school programs for teens, and hands-on art activities and programs for families. Funds also help provide free or reduced admission for over 180,000 families and community members.

Media sponsorship is provided by _San Francisco_ magazine.
