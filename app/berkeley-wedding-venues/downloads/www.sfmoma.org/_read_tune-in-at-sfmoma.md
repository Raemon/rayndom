While exploring our galleries, you may have noticed that some of our QR codes are wearing a cool new accessory: headphones. They signal an exciting development at SFMOMA: a new-and-improved interface for accessing our audio stops. 

Starting April 2023, the SFMOMA app will not be supported. From now on, access our audio stops two easy ways. Either:

  * Scan the QR codes (pictured below) on museum walls with your mobile phone camera.
  * Head straight to [**sfmoma****.org/audio**](https://www.sfmoma.org/audio/) on your preferred mobile web browser to access the stop number keypad.

Label of what the audio guide symbols look like on the wall in the museum.

All audio stops are now housed on our very own website for a more seamless, user-friendly experience — so that everyone can access these multimedia stories!

If the stop number has a globe pictured, these multimedia stops are supported in different languages, such as Spanish and Mandarin.

### **Helpful Tips:**

From the keypad, enter the 3 digit number on the wall text next to artworks that have audio support, and it will pull up a page of multimedia stories, audio descriptions, and information about the artwork itself.

The keypad, accessed through sfmoma.org/audio.

A landing page for audio stops, where you can access Art Goggles, or our Architecture Tour. Accessible by pressing 123 on the keypad.

Accessible by pressing 123 on the keypad. 

If you’re looking for Art Goggles or our special tours, simply hit 123! Our 123 stop number takes you to a hub for all the stops that are not specifically tied to an artwork.

Anytime you want to go to a new stop number, just pull the keypad up and put the number that’s near the artwork label on the wall in and a new page about the artwork right in front of you will appear.

An example of an audio guide stop. The numbers 551 would be the stop number for this Lichtenstein painting.
