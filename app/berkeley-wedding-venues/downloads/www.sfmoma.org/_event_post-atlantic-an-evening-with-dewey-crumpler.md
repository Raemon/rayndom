Join us for a dive into the work of painter, philosopher, and SFAI alumnus and former professor [**Dewey Crumpler**](https://deweycrumpler.com/). The program begins with a screening of the recent documentary **_Post Atlantic: The Art of Dewey Crumpler_**. Directed by Alan Snitow and Deborah Kaufman, the film shares the visionary world of Crumpler as he connects the slave trade to modern globalization and demonstrates what it means to be a working artist with a conscience today. The screening will be followed by a conversation between Crumpler and Jordan Stein that digs further into Crumpler’s work, worldview, and the impact of SFAI. Snitow and Kaufman will also be in attendance.
