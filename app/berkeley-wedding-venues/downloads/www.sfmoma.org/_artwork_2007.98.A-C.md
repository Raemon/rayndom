**Main Level **

**Artist Tacita Dean on taking a portrait of a tree**

NARRATOR:

Artist Tacita Dean on how she found her way to this tree, Beauty

TACITA DEAN:

_In England, I looked for the oldest complete oak tree, which was called Majesty. Now, when I went to photograph Majesty, which had been growing, they don ’t really know how long, but they think it’s at least seven- or eight-hundred years old—next door to Majesty was a sister tree of similar, but not the same age, which they call Beauty._

_And I wasn ’t expecting to find Beauty; I went for Majesty. But seeing Beauty standing next to Majesty, I photographed Beauty, too and I painted around every single branch with white gouache. Something very satisfying about making the tree sculptural. Bringing it out of its background, denying the background._

NARRATOR:

But why trees as a subject?

DEAN:

_Apart from saying something as asinine as saying I love trees, for me, it was also to do with the individuality of a tree and how deformed it becomes, you know, through age. And obviously, there are parallels, not only with myself, but also with some of the older people I ’ve been making films of in the last few years. There’s a sort of portraiture going on._
