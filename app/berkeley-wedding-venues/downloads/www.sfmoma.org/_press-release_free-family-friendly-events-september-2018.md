EVENT  
**Added Value: An Alternative Book Sale  
****Saturday, September 22, and Sunday, September 23  
****SFMOMA**

_Public Knowledge_ —an ongoing partnership between the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) and the San Francisco Public Library (SFPL)—invites all bibliophiles to see how artist Stephanie Syjuco, librarians Rick and Megan Prelinger and artist collective Related Tactics create new life from misfit books at _Added Value: An Alternative Book Sale_. 

Over the course of the weekend, this playful, interactive event will transform SFMOMA’s free spaces into a massive public book sale, featuring a radical re-organization of thousands of used books from the Donation Center of the Friends of the San Francisco Public Library. Artists Lukaza Branfam-Verissimo, Cliff Hengst, Dionne Lee, Jenny Odell, Marcela Pardo, Sofie Ramos, Leila Weefur and Lindsay White will also transform forsaken tomes at a Re-Valuation Station in SFMOMA’s Public Knowledge Library. Books will be priced individually ($1–3 each) and all proceeds will benefit the SPFL. 

In addition, the weekend will feature a program of free library-themed films and author readings. Select films will include Frederick Wiseman’s documentary _Ex-Libris: The New York Public Library_ (2017) and Francois Truffaut’s _Fahrenheit 451_ (1966). In celebration of _Added Value,_ visitors will receive 10% off all books at the Museum Store.

This event is free and open to the public; museum admission is not required. For details, see _[publicknowledge.sfmoma.org/added-value](https://publicknowledge.sfmoma.org/added-value/)_.
