### What:

The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) announces a performance weekend featuring new commissions by its inaugural _Performance in Progress_ artists from March 16 through 19, 2017. After preview weekends at the museum in fall 2016, Desirée Holman, Naomi Rincón Gallardo and Jacolby Satterwhite will return to debut performances developed over the course of a year-long engagement with SFMOMA. 

### Why:

Continuing its dedication to emerging contemporary artists, and building on a legacy of engagement with performance initiated in the 1960s, SFMOMA commissions local, national and international artists to develop groundbreaking live work through its _Performance in Progress_ series.__ Launched in fall 2016, _Performance in Progress_ invites artists and audiences alike to explore the artistic process and participate in the creation of new work with unique behind-the-scenes access. 

### When:

##### Thursday and Friday, March 16–17, 8 p.m.

_Performance in Progress_ presents the debut of _The Formaldehyde Trip,_ a performance and video work by Mexico City–based artist Naomi Rincón Gallardo. Co-curated with Galería de la Raza,_The Formaldehyde Trip_ weaves together Mesoamerican cosmologies, feminist activism and theory and indigenous women’s struggles for their territories. This new commission imagines the murdered Mixtec activist Alberta “Bety” Cariño in her journey through the underworld where she encounters warriors, witches and the dual-gendered goddess of death. 

#### Jacolby Satterwhite

Gina and Stuart Peterson White Box, Floor 4

__New York–based artist Jacolby Satterwhite premieres the visual album _En Plein Air: Music of Objective Romance_. In this newly commissioned piece, he builds an immersive virtual reality dreamscape from his mother Patricia’s archive of 12 a cappella albums, featuring tracks selected by the artist and his musical collaborator Nick Weiss (Teengirl Fantasy). 

#### Desirée Holman

##### Saturday, March 18, 6 p.m.  
Sunday, March 19, 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.
