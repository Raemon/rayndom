# Our History

### **Oakland's Art Deco Ballroom since 1926**

During the Roaring Twenties, everyone loved a party. Built in 1926, the 7,500-square-foot California Ballroom showcases a majestic high gold leaf ceiling, as well as a large stage with curtains and spotlights and a sizable dance floor. An invitation to this impressive Art Deco landmark — just a few blocks from picturesque Lake Merritt — is an occasion to look forward to.
