### Measure FF Update

In **November 2018** , voters in western Alameda and Contra Costa counties overwhelmingly passed Measure FF with**85.6%** of the vote. (66.6% was needed). Measure FF is a **20-year measure** that will expire in 2040. It is an extension of Measure CC passed in 2004  – without increasing taxes. **Measure FF extends an existing $12/year ($1/month) parcel tax.**

### Measure FF Background

On June 5, 2018, the Board of Directors voted unanimously to place Measure FF on the November 2018 ballot. Measure FF will continue to fund regional park services including:

  * [Wildfire prevention](/public-safety/fire-safety-and-prevention)
  * [Public safety](/safety)
  * Maintaining and improving visitor use facilities, public access, and trails, including closing gaps in the Bay Trail
  * Restoring and enhancing natural areas/habitat, including sensitive redwoods, urban creeks, marshlands, grasslands, and hillsides



Measure FF was developed with community input including three community meetings, four public board meetings, and engagement of key stakeholder, including the Sierra Club, Audubon Society, and Save the Redwoods League, among others.

Measure FF will appear on both Alameda and Contra Costa County ballots in the communities of **Oakland, Berkeley, Richmond, Alameda, San Pablo, El Cerrito, Albany, Emeryville, Piedmont, El Sobrante, and Kensington.**

### Measure FF Priorities

#### Wildfire Protection and Healthy Forests

Measure FF will provide continued funding for fire hazard reduction, firefighters, and sustainable forest management, consistent with the Park District’s approved and fully permitted [Wildfire Hazard Reduction and Resource Management Plan](/wildfire-hazard-reduction-and-resource-management-plan). Voter-approved funding currently supports the thinning or removal of hazardous vegetation on over 500 acres annually. Fire hazard reduction and sustainable forest management is the top spending priority of Measure FF.

#### Public Access, Trails, and Visitor Use Facilities

Measure FF will provide continued funding for trail maintenance and expansion of trails for increased public access, including closing gaps in the Bay Trail which will improve regional connectivity for commuters and safe routes to school for children. Measure FF will also provide funding to keep the Crab Cove Visitor Center in Alameda open year-round and for new interpretive/educational programs at Point Pinole and MLK Jr. Shorelines.

#### Natural Habitat, Urban Creeks, and Shorelines

Measure FF will provide funding for ongoing erosion control, watershed protection, redwood conservation, and preservation/restoration of natural habitat, including urban creeks, marshes, and shorelines for endangered species and to prepare parklands for the future impacts of climate change.
