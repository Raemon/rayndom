## Enjoy Your Parks Safely

The Park District’s Public Safety division comprises 3 departments – Police, Fire, and Lifeguard. They provide services in law enforcement, fire-fighting and suppression, water safety and education respectively.

The Public Safety Division's annual budget is $41.2 million. At peak summer season, the Division is staffed by around 450 personnel, which includes:

  * 158 full-time equivalent employees (77 of whom are sworn police officers who derive their authority under CA Penal code section 830.1)
  * 151 members of our Volunteer Trail Safety Patrols
  * 150 seasonal lifeguards
  * 24 on-call firefighters



We are very proud of our commitment to the community and the partnerships we have formed along the way, realizing that safety and quality of life are both personal and shared responsibilities. We strive to make the Regional Parks one of the nation's safest open space and recreation areas. We make every effort to provide an excellent park experience for our frequent and occasional visitors alike.
