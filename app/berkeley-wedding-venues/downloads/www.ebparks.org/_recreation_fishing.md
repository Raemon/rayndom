Visitor Notice

A [California Fishing License](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Licensing/Fishing) is required for anglers, (16+ years of age), to fish all eligible inland waters, (lakes, ponds and reservoirs) of the East Bay Regional Park District.

Anglers 16+ years of age are required to purchase a [District Fishing Permit](/rentals-and-permits/permits/fishing-permit) in addition to having a valid State Fishing license. District lakes that **do not require a District Fishing Permit** include: [Lake Anza](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/tilden) (Berkeley), [Don Castro Lagoon](/parks/don-castro) (Castro Valley), [Jordan Pond](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/garin) (Hayward) and [Shinn Pond](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/quarry-lakes) (Niles/Fremont).

[Daily Fishing Permit (Online)](https://anc.apm.activecommunities.com/ebparks/reservation/landing/search/detail/557)

**Boating is allowed** at Contra Loma, Del Valle, Lake Chabot, Quarry Lakes, and Shadow Cliffs. Please check park webpages and current [Alerts & Closures](/alerts-closures) for conditions that might affect boating or fishing.

## Fishing Information

[District Rules and Regulations regarding Fishing](http://www.municode.com/library/ca/east_bay_regional_park_district/codes/ordinance_38_-_rules_and_regulations?nodeId=CHVIIIPAFERO_S800ANPRHUFI "Fishing") (Section 800.1)

Read the [**Anglers' Edge**](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/fishing/anglers-edge-online) newsletter for fish planting information and the latest fishing conditions.

The East Bay Regional Park District offers 10 lakes and reservoirs and over 25 miles of Bay/Delta shoreline and piers for fishing in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties. The District plants catchable rainbow trout, (fall through spring) and channel catfish, (summer) in cooperation with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife at the following locations:

The revenue generated from sales of District Fishing Permits allows the District to plant rainbow trout and channel catfish, (1 - 12+ pounds ea.) on a weekly basis. The District and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife plant over 200,000 pounds of catchable trout and catfish annually.

In addition to planting rainbow trout and channel catfish, the District promotes the reproduction and growth of other gamefish species in all of its lakes. These gamefish include largemouth, and smallmouth bass, bluegill, sunfish and crappie. ([See Fish Habitat link](/natural-resources/biodiversity/fisheries))

From fly-fishing trout on Lake Chabot, to shore fishing for striped bass on Alameda Beach, the East Bay Regional Park District features many resources for all kinds of fishing.

## Fishing Field Trips

The Outdoor Recreation Department provides affordable fishing field trips for schools, non-profits, and community organizations. Our knowledgeable and engaging Recreation staff provide fishing rods, bait, and gear, meet your group at the lake or shoreline, and provide a safe and organized introduction to freshwater or saltwater fishing. Depending on the location we can offer catch and release or catch and keep your fish programs. Programs occur at the following Regional parks: Antioch Pier, Big Break, Contra Loma, Del Valle, Martin Luther King, Jr., Miller/Knox, Point Pinole, Quarry Lakes, Shadow Cliffs, and Temescal Regional Parks. Trips can range from 1.5 to 3 hours, and costs vary, depending on group size and duration. Participants must be at least 8 years old. We can accommodate up to 20 participants at a time.
