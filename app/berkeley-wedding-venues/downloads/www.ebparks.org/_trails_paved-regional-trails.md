The East Bay Regional Park District maintains an extensive network of paved trails. These trails tend to be flat with many entrance and exit points and are perfect for road bikes, roller blades, skateboards, and other wheeled devices operated by human power. With the exception of wheelchairs and mobility vehicles, motorized or electric-powered scooters, bikes or other motorized vehicles are prohibited.

Paved trails are great resources for youngsters learning to ride or novices who want to avoid riding alongside traffic. Keep in mind that the trails cross many residential streets, so always stop and look for cars before proceeding. Some sections of the trails may have minor ruts or small sections of gravel, which could be challenging to those on rollerblades or bicycles.

#### Paved Trails

  * [Alameda Creek Regional Trail](/trails/interpark/alameda-creek), Fremont - a flat, double trail along Alameda Creek from Niles Canyon to the bay. The trail on the southern bank (11 miles) is paved and good for bicycles (horses are not permitted); the trail on the northern bank (12.4 miles) is hard-packed gravel, suitable for equestrians, and mountain bikers who don't want to ride on pavement.
  * [Alamo Canal Regional Trail](/sites/default/files/alamo-creek-reg-tr-iht_montevideo_dubpleasbart.pdf), Dublin - less than 1 mile, this paved trail extends from the Iron Horse Trail in Dublin, just south of Amador Valley Road, to I-580 near the Civic Center and Library. At the library, the trail connects to the Centennial Trail, which continues south about 1.75 miles to the Arroyo Mocho Trail just south of W. Las Positas Blvd., and farther south to the Arroyo Del Valle Trail.
  * [Big Break Regional Trail](/sites/default/files/big-break-reg-tr-marsh_cr_tr.pdf), Oakley - a 2.75-mile paved portion is complete from the Marsh Creek Regional Trail west to Big Break Road in Oakley. The trail provides access to the Big Break visitor center and to viewing the delta along the Big Break shoreline
  * [Contra Costa Canal Regional Trail](/trails/interpark/contra-costa-canal), Contra Costa County - a 13.5-mile, flat, paved trail connecting Martinez, Pleasant Hill, Walnut Creek, and Concord. Beginning at Muir Road in Martinez, and ending in Concord at Willow Pass Road east of Sixth Street, the trail follows the Contra Costa Canal for its entire route. The trail intersects the Iron Horse Trail in Walnut Creek at its approximate mid-point and provides access to Heather Farm in Walnut Creek and many other municipal parks.
  * [Coyote Hills Bayview Trail](/parks/coyote-hills), Fremont - this 4-mile, paved, loop circles the park along San Francisco Bay at the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. Some rolling hills. A mountain bike is suggested for a few small stretches with gravel but can be done on a road bike with sturdy tires.
  * [Robert W. Crown Memorial State Beach](/parks/crown-beach), Alameda - a 2.5-mile paved, flat trail that follows the shoreline. Extend the trip another mile across Alameda's own dedicated bicycle drawbridge onto Bay Farm Island.
  * [Delta de Anza Regional Trail](/trails/interpark/delta-de-anza), East Contra Costa County - 19-mile, relatively flat, paved trail connecting Concord, Bay Point, Pittsburg, Antioch, and Oakley. A good starting point is Antioch Community Park in Antioch with access to Contra Loma Regional Park. The trail's eastern terminus is the Marsh Creek Trail in Oakley, providing a route northward to the pleasant Big Break shoreline.
  * [Iron Horse Regional Trail](/trails/interpark/iron-horse) \- a 26-mile, relatively flat, paved trail with mild rolling hills in some places. the trail connects the cities of Pleasanton, Dublin, San Ramon, Danville, Walnut Creek, Pleasant Hill, and Concord. The trail passes over several creeks and pedestrian bridges. Civic Park in Walnut Creek, Danville Railroad Museum in Danville, and Central Park in San Ramon make nice areas to access the trail.
  * [Lafayette-Moraga Regional Trail](/trails/interpark/lafayette-moraga) \- a 7.7-mile, paved, flat trail that parallels St. Mary's Road through Moraga and into Lafayette. The trail's western terminus is at EBMUD's Valle Vista staging area west of Moraga, and it continues northeast to a staging area at Pleasant Hill Road and Olympic Blvd. in Lafayette.
  * [Marsh Creek Regional Trail](/trails/interpark/marsh-creek), East Contra Costa County - this 9.2-mile, paved trail connects Brentwood and Oakley. The trail extends from Concord Ave. in Brentwood north through Creekside Park and on to Big Break Regional Trail and the Big Break shoreline in Oakley.
  * Nimitz Way, Tilden, from Inspiration Point - 4 miles (one way) of paved trail, with rolling hills and beautiful views. Best for mountain bikes since you have to pass over a few cattle guard crossings but is doable on road bikes. Watch your speed on the downhills!
  * Portions of the San Francisco Bay Trail
    * [McLaughlin Eastshore State Park](/parks/mclaughlin-eastshore), Richmond - beginning at Marina Bay in Richmond to Central Avenue near Point Isabel - 2 1/2 miles of paved trail along the Hoffman Marsh
    * [Martin Luther King Regional Shoreline](/parks/martin-luther-king), Oakland - Over 5 miles of paved trails along San Leandro Bay, San Leandro Creek, and Arrowhead Marsh. Good access points are Swan Way off Doolittle Drive and two staging areas off Edgewater Drive.
    * [Oyster Bay](/parks/oyster-bay), San Leandro - 2 miles of flat, paved trail circles the park at the end of Neptune Drive off Marina Blvd.
    * [Hayward Regional Shoreline](/parks/hayward), Hayward - Over 7 miles of compacted gravel walkways. Flat but best for mountain bikes. Follow the S.F. Bay Trail from the staging area at the end of Grant Avenue to Hayward Shoreline Interpretive Center (about 5 miles one way).
  * Reinhardt Redwood Regional Park, Oakland - 1 mile of paved, flat trail through a beautiful redwood forest. Proceeding north from the Canyon Meadow Staging Area (Redwood Gate entrance), this trail is perfect for young children on bikes. It's a 2-mile out-and-back along the Stream Trail and makes a nice place to go to beat the summer heat.
