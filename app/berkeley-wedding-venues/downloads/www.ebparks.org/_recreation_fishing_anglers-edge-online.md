## Important Information

### Anglers:

  1. **Do not let your dog eat or lick raw trout/salmon.** They may be infected with a parasitic disease which can be fatal to your pet. For more information call Fisheries Manager Joe Sullivan at [(510) 544-2329](tel:1-510-544-2329).
  2. **EBRPD recommends all bass be released.** Please do not remove tags from released bass. Record the tag number, length, and weight of the fish to include in your catch report.
  3. **Please report your catches and turn in all retrieved tags from kept bass to the marina or kiosk attendant. Length and weight (if possible), location and date would be helpful also.**
  4. **Please remember to clean up any fouled line and bait containers.** Wildlife can be injured or killed by fishing line! Please use the special fishing line disposal tubes at Del Valle, Lake Chabot, Quarry Lakes and Shadow Cliffs. Recycling your broken fishing monofilament helps protect wildlife.
  5. **All park hours are 6am to 7pm unless otherwise posted.**
  6. **No smoking on EBRPD property including all piers, parks and trails[(Ord. 38, Sec. 404.3)](https://library.municode.com/ca/east_bay_regional_park_district/codes/ordinance_38_-_rules_and_regulations?nodeId=CHIVPAUSEN_S404FIIM "SECTION 404. - FIRES. \(M\)")**



### Mandatory Boat Inspections:

#### _(Including motorboats, rowboats, kayaks, canoes and float tubes)_

To prevent invasive Zebra and Quagga mussel infestation, the East Bay Regional Park District is performing mandatory boat inspections. All watercraft must be "clean and dry" to pass inspection. Standing water or water from the motor being lowered means the craft will fail inspection. Failing inspection means the craft will not be allowed to launch, **_AND_** results in a 5-day quarantine period before another inspection.

**Boat inspections are performed at the following lakes: Lake Chabot, Del Valle, Quarry Lakes, Contra Loma, Shadow Cliffs**

We have a banding program for clean boats. Intact bands will expedite launching at the above lakes. For more information, visit our [Invasive Mussel Program](/recreation/boating/invasive-mussels) page or, call 888-EBPARKS. 




## Fish Planting Information

The East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) plants Mt. Lassen Trout and Channel Catfish up to 6+ pounds each. The California Department of Fish & Wildlife (DF&W) plants trout averaging over ½ pound each.**Plants are subject to change due to weather conditions.**
