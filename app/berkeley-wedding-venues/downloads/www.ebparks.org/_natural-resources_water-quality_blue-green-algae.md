## Blue-Green Algae Information

Blue-green algae—also known as cyanobacteria—are not actually “true” algae. Rather, they are naturally occurring, photosynthetic bacteria found worldwide in both marine and freshwater environments. The term _blue-green algae_ comes from their characteristic color, which results from photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll (green) and phycocyanin (blue), as well as from their algae-like ability to photosynthesize. 

Certain conditions—low water levels, limited water circulation, and increased water temperature and light, among other factors—can allow blue-green algae to outcompete other aquatic organisms, reproduce rapidly (bloom), and potentially create and release toxins. Blue-green algae blooms have been documented worldwide, but scientists still do not know what causes these organisms to create toxins. 

In 2014, the Park District experienced it first known toxic harmful algal bloom (HAB) at Lake Temescal, which closed the lake to swimming. Since then, HAB incidents have been observed with increasing frequency, leading the Park District to update water quality and HAB monitoring programs. Unfortunately, toxic HABs have been documented in all major Park District water bodies. 

The most common blue-green algae toxins are microcystins. Exposure to toxic algae—through ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact—can cause a range of health effects, including rashes; skin and eye irritation; allergic reactions; difficulty breathing or congestion; and gastrointestinal illness. In cases of high exposure, toxic algae can cause serious illness or death, according to the California Department of Public Health. 

HABs pose a special risk to park visitors who bring dogs. Even a small amount of toxin consumption can be dangerous to **dogs** and even result in death. Dogs can ingest toxins by drinking from contaminated water, swimming or wading in it, licking algae or scum off their fur or paws, and eating dried algae patches along the shoreline. During a HAB incident, park visitors should heed all warnings about contact with water, including preventing dogs from access.

To ensure **fish** caught from Park District water bodies are safe for human consumption, fish from all Park District reservoirs are tested for microcystin toxins annually. To date, toxins have never been detected in the flesh of any fish in water bodies managed by the Park District. To be safe, during a blue-green algae advisory, avoid any unnecessary contact with the water and wash your hands after handling fish or wet equipment. Always wash fish fillets thoroughly with tap or bottled water. Discard the guts and liver. Cook fish thoroughly to kill off any remaining bacteria.

**Drinking water** from the Del Valle drinking water plant is tested regularly to ensure algal blooms do not impact drinking water sourced from the reservoir. 

As we experience longer periods of drought and higher temperatures resulting from climate change, increased frequency and duration of HABs are expected. The Park District has implemented various management strategies to try to reduce bloom frequencies and intensities by targeting the conditions that increase their likelihood. 

Low oxygen and high levels of phosphorus can trigger a bloom. To address these factors, a Hypolimnetic Oxygenation System (HOS), a common HAB mitigation strategy, was installed at Lake Anza in Tilden Regional Park in July 2020. In 2025, Lake Anza and Lake Temescal received phosphorus reduction treatments with great success. Both swim beaches stayed open the entire swim season without HAB-related closures. Also in 2025, an Oxygen Saturation Technology (OST) system was installed in Lake Temescal to improve water quality.

## Current Water Quality Conditions

Due to the drought and unusually warm weather conditions, toxic blooms of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and other water-quality issues are occurring more frequently in the East Bay Regional Park District and elsewhere. We monitor our lakes and shorelines regularly and post warnings and closures when appropriate. Here’s a current update of which lakes and shorelines are affected:
