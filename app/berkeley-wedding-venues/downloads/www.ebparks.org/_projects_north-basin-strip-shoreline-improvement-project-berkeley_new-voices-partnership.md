East Bay Regional Park District’s New Voices Partnership for the North Basin Strip Project in Berkeley was selected for an Underserved Communities Merit Award by California Trails & Greenways ([CTG](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=24151)). The Awards Program is an opportunity to bring acknowledgement and appreciation to the individuals, organizations, agencies, and business that, through their hard work, integrity, and social responsibility, have made outstanding contributions to promote, enhance, or expand public awareness and use of trails and greenways in California during the previous calendar year. Congratulations to the New Voices Partnership Team!

### **New Voices Partnership Information**

The East Bay Regional Park District will be holding a variety of public engagement activities as part of the process to plan enhancements to the North Basin Strip on the Berkeley shoreline. In addition to stakeholder meetings and community meetings open to the general public, EBRPD is providing a series of capacity-building training workshops that aim to empower previously underrepresented communities to participate in the park planning process. We are seeking diverse partners, both organizations and individuals, to join a leadership cohort: The New Voices Partnership.

Stipends of up to $1,000 provided.

The New Voices Partnership is an opportunity for community-based organizations and individuals to build capacity and advance their missions by helping to plan a shoreline park to serve our communities’ needs for healthy and accessible outdoor spaces.

Over the course of nine months, the New Voices cohort will attend three interactive training workshops, one small stakeholder meeting, several large community meetings, and participate in a final review and reflection.

Organizations are invited to nominate staff, board, or constituents to represent their organizations. Individuals not affiliated with a specific organization are also invited to apply.

**WHY**  
WE BELIEVE PARKS ARE:  
Essential to our health, well-being, social connections, and are one of the joys of living in the East Bay. 

Our goal is to increase participation by communities historically underrepresented in park planning and help our regional parks better address needs across communities.

We want to help parks more effectively intersect with and support sectors including:

  * Public health
  * Mental health
  * Environmental justice
  * Social justice
  * Outdoor recreation
  * Arts and culture
  * Youth development
  * Senior services
  * Disability rights and beyond

### **New Voices FAQ**

Q. Will workshops be remote or in-person?  
A. All workshops and meetings will be in person. If you are selected as a New Voices participant and attending in person is difficult for you because of disabilities, we will do our best to help you participate without attending in person. Field trips will be designed to accommodate people of diverse abilities.

Q. What does “up to $1,000 stipend” mean?  
A. We expect to be able to provide a stipend of $1,000 per person. However, if we have many participants, the stipend might be slightly lower. 

Q. Are transportation stipends available?  
A. The participation stipend is intended to help cover transportation costs.

Q. When will New Voices cohort events occur?  
A. They will be scheduled to meet the needs of the participants as much as possible. The application form asks you to indicate your availability.

Q. When will the park be built?  
A. This planning process will create a plan expected to be completed in summer 2025. Securing funding for development of the park and construction will occur in coming years.

Q. If I can’t commit to all the meetings required of New Voices, can I still participate in the park planning process?  
A. We ask that all New Voices participants commit to attending all training workshops and as many stakeholder and community meetings as possible—this is where you will use the knowledge gained in the workshops to represent your community. 

However, even if you are not in the New Voices training cohort, you can participate in public community meetings that are part of the regular park planning process. If you think you cannot commit to participating as a New Voices participant, but would like to be informed of upcoming stakeholder and community meetings, sign up for updates here [link].

Q. How will New Voices participants be selected?  
A. New Voices participants will be selected by the park planning team (EBRPD and Consultants). A diverse cohort will be selected to ensure a broad range of perspectives, interests, and experiences are represented and that previously under-represented and cross-sector viewpoints are included.

Q. What if I’m part of the local mountain biking club or environmental organization. Can I participate in the New Voices training?  
A. The New Voices workshops are designed for organizations that are new to park planning or have had limited participation in the past, including sectors outside the recreation and environmental fields. If you are part of a group that has been active in advocating for a parks-related interest in the past, we warmly invite you to participate in the community meetings that will be publicly announced over the next year. Your opinions are important, and we want to make sure they are heard. Please sign up to be notified of meetings here [link].

Q. If I have questions about New Voices before applying, whom should I contact?  
A. Please email Susan Moffat, coordinator of New Voices, at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e7898895938f8586948e899493958e97a79095938382948e8089c984888a).
