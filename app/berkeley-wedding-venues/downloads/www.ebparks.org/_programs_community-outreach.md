### Outdoor Recreation Field Trips (Biking / Boating / Fishing)

The Outdoor Recreation Department provides affordable biking, boating, and fishing field trips for schools and community organizations. Our knowledgeable and engaging Recreation staff provide the gear; meet your group at the park; and lead a safe and organized trip at our beautiful Regional Parks, Lakes, Trails, and Shorelines. Trips can range from 1.5 to 3 hours, and costs vary, depending on group size and duration. However, we can accommodate larger groups if we split into two rotations.

### Day Camp and Camping Trip Partnerships

The Outdoor Recreation Department works closely with many local organizations and schools to break down barriers to outdoor recreation, and help all of our communities enjoy safe, fun, and uplifting experiences in the great outdoors. First, we offer a 2-year partnership with Alameda and Contra Costa County schools and non-profits, where 50 elementary-school aged children can enjoy a free week of Day Camp in the Regional Parks. Second, we offer a 3-year partnership program to local non-profits where our staff provide one free camping trip + three day trips to your organization for three consecutive years.
