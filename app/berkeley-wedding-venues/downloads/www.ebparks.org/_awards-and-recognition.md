We are continually evaluating and adapting to changing landscapes to protect our parklands and to stay relevant to the communities we serve. We are committed to excellence and accountability within our agency. We partner strategically with agencies, community organizations, and businesses to leverage our collective resources and knowledge for the greatest impact.  
  
Over the years, the Park District has been recognized by peers, credentialing authorities and accrediting organizations for our leadership in financial management, public safety service, land preservation, land use planning, innovation in interpretive programming, community services, health and wellness initiatives and programs, and communications.
