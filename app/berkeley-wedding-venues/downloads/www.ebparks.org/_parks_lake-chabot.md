Lake Chabot Reservoir was built in 1874-75 as a primary source of water for the East Bay. The 315-acre lake was closed to recreation for 91 years. Legislation passed in the 1960s opened the lake for controlled recreational uses. On June 18, 1966, EBRPD opened Lake Chabot Regional Park to the public after securing an agreement with the East Bay Municipal Utilities District (EBMUD), which owns and operates the reservoir.   
  
Currently, the lake serves as a standby emergency water supply. For this reason, visitors are asked to observe certain necessary regulations to keep the waters pure.

The 315-acre Lake Chabot is stocked with trout and catfish. There are also bass, crappie, and other fish. A popular event is the annual spring fishing derby. There are several fishing piers in the park. Enjoy scenic walks on the 280-acre Fairmont Ridge or take the [Lake Chabot History Walk (PDF)](/sites/default/files/lakechabot_historywalk_1997.pdf "Click here to download Lake Chabot History Walk pdf"). An outdoor [Fitness Zone](/parks/lake-chabot/fitness-zone) has six interactive exercise machines set in a rain garden landscaped with native plants.

Services include rental of kayaks and boats (see "Fishing and Boating" below), the [Lake Chabot Marina & Café ](https://lakechabotrecreation.com/)(a cafe and bait and tackle shop).

Among the many amenities you can find picnicking areas, a grassy play area, horseshoe pits, hiking, bicycling, jogging, and running trails, and seasonal lake tours aboard the tour boat "Chabot Queen." The tour boat may be chartered for lake tours (see "Fishing and Boating" below).

### Fishing and Boating

The 315-acre, well-stocked lake is open for fishing and boating throughout the year. It is a popular Bay Area fishing destination, ideal for kids out for their first fishing experience.

The Lake Chabot Marina Cafe offers a well-stocked bait and tackle shop and is open year round (closed Thanksgiving and Christmas). It features a restaurant that serves snacks, breakfast, and lunch.

Fishing at Lake Chabot requires a current [California Fishing License](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Licensing/Fishing) with stamps and a daily [District Fishing Permit](/rentals-and-permits/permits/fishing-permit) for all anglers aged 16 and older. California Fish and Game regulations apply. Fishing licenses and EBRPD permits may be purchased at the Marina Cafe. No live fish may be used as bait. All other legal bait and lures are permitted. Fish may be cleaned only at the cleaning station along the walk near the parking lot.

Catch-and-release angling is encouraged for bass, bluegill, and crappie. However, the release of badly hooked game fish and all non-game fish is not allowed. Please bring any unwanted and tagged fish and your completed creel census card (on the back of the fishing permit) to the Chabot Marina.

With your cooperation, we can maintain an effective fish management program to ensure that you will always have good fishing. For more info and fees, visit the [Fishing](/recreation/fishing) page.

Rental boats and tour boat rides are available at the marina. The tour boat may be chartered for lake tours by calling (510) 247-2526. Naturalist-led tours may be scheduled by calling [(510) 544-3187](tel:1-510-544-3187) or visiting our [Educator Resources](/programs/educators) page for more information. Rental boats include rowboats, pedal boats, kayaks, Duffy boats, and boats with electric trolling motors. For more information on rental boats see [Lake Chabot Marina & Cafe](https://lakechabotrecreation.com/) online or call [(510) 247-2526](tel:1-510-247-2526).

Non-motorized vessels such as canoes, kayaks, and scull craft 20 feet and under may be carried in and launched ($3). Inflatables with 3 or more chambers are allowed. Float tubes may be used at Lake Chabot. Persons using float tubes must wear waders or other wet-suit material to prevent body contact with the water in the reservoir.
