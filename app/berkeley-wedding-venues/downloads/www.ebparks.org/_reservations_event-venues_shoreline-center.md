## About the Facility

Once a waterfront cafe, the Shoreline Center sits on the shores of the San Leandro Bay at the [MLK Jr. Regional Shoreline](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/martin-luther-king). With its mid-century modern architecture and deck with panoramic views of the bay and East Bay hills, the Shoreline Center is an oasis right in the geographic center of the Bay Area.

The Shoreline Center is perfect for micro weddings, celebrations, bridal and baby showers, small workshops, and retreats. The Pelican Picnic Area offers additional event space. Our approved caterers and preferred vendors can help you flawlessly execute your event from start to finish. We also offer a DIY non-catered option for reservations that end by 7pm.
