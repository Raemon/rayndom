### Fitness Swim (+16)

Join us every Friday throughout the summer for Fitness Swimming at the Robert’s Regional Recreation Area. Whether you are interested in swimming in one of our predetermined workouts or just want to follow your own plan, our fitness swimming is a great way to improve cardiovascular health, tone muscles, and maintain a healthy weight. As part of each 55-minute session, participants will be provided with a set workout they can follow, kickboards, pool buoys, and a dedicated fitness swim lifeguard who can give feedback or guidance if desired. All skill levels are welcome. Sign up early, as space is limited. Fitness Swimmers will have access to a prewritten swimming workout of the day, a pace clock, a kickboard, and a pull buoy. A lifeguard will be on duty during fitness swimming.
