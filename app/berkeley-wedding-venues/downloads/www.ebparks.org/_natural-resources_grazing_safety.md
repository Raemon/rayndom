# What To Do Around Cattle

__Back to top

[Animals grazing](/natural-resources/grazing) in the parks can come with some trade-offs for visitors. In the rainy season, cattle can cause damage to trails, making the ground muddy and unpleasant to walk through. Cows also produce manure, requiring visitors to remain aware while on the trails. Cattle are also large animals and, while not aggressive by nature, can respond in a potentially dangerous manner if startled or threatened. 

Here is what to do when around cattle in the parks: 

  * **Leash Your Dog.** Per Ordinance 38, dogs are required to be on leash in areas where grazing animals are present. Cattle don’t always differentiate between dogs and coyotes, and can become agitated, creating unsafe conditions for dogs, cattle and humans. Protect yourself, your pets, and cattle by keeping your dog on leash around cattle. 
  * **Give Cattle Distance.** If cattle are blocking the trail, approach slowly, speak normally, and allow them time to move away. If possible, walk around cattle or go off-trail if necessary. 
  * **Leave Calves Alone.** Do not get close, touch, or pet them. Cows are protective of their calves. If a calf appears to be alone, the mother cow is usually nearby and will return to care for it soon. Interfering can result in the death of the calf. 
  * **Close Pedestrian Gates Behind You.** Leaving pedestrian gates open is the primary cause of livestock being where they are not wanted. Vehicle gates should be left as they are found – open or closed.
