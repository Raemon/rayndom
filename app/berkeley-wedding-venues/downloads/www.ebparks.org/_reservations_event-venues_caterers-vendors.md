[ Approved Caterers List (Opens in new window) ](/sites/default/files/EBRPD-2026-Approved-Caterers-List.pdf)

[ Preferred Vendors List (Opens in new window) ](/sites/default/files/EBRPD-2026-Preferred-Vendors-List.pdf)

You may hire a caterer from the Approved list or choose the non-catered option.

  * At the Brazilian Room, the non-catered option is available only for reservations on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays ending by 7pm. An approved caterer is required for all reservations ending after 7pm and on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.


  * At the Temescal Beach House, Fern Cottage, and Shoreline Center, the non-catered option is available only for reservations ending by 7pm (including clean-up). An approved caterer is required for all reservations ending after 7pm.



If you choose the non-catered option you may not use an outside caterer or have any hired staff. Your unpaid volunteers will be required to attend an orientation. You will pay an additional fee for the ability to use the non-catered option.

Events must also be fully catered on the following holidays regardless of the reservation time: New Year’s Eve, New Year’s Day, Washington’s Day, Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, Day After Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day.

We also maintain a list of optional preferred vendors that have knowledge and experience working at our facilities. You are welcome to bring in your own licensed and insured vendors from these categories as well. Please also check with our Approved Caterers who may also provide these services.
