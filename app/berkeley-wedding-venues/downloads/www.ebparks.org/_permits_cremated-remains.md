# Scattering of Cremated Remains Permit

__Back to top

In November 2005, the East Bay Regional Park District Board of Directors approved a policy to allow the scattering of cremated remains in the Regional Parks. The guidelines are intended to ensure that the scattering complies with all State of California Health and Safety codes. Please review the [EBRPD Cremated Remains Policy](/sites/default/files/Cremated-Remains-Policy.pdf).

Complete applications will be sent to the Park Supervisor to review and approve. If more information or clarification is needed, the Park Supervisor may contact you to discuss.

Before submitting your application, be sure to have the following items, as you will be unable to submit the form without them:

  1. Documentation from the mortuary or crematorium identifying the cremated remains
  2. A map of the proposed scatter location



Maps can be found here: [Maps | East Bay Parks (ebparks.org)](https://www.ebparks.org/maps). The selected location must be at least 500 feet from any archeological, historical, or Native American ceremonial site; any residence, park structure, or public use area; any swimming pool, lagoon or beach, any reservoir, lake, stream, pond, or other bodies of water; any designated nature study area, wetland, marsh, or any other area specifically restricted by action of the Assistant General Manager of Operations.

Scattering is also _not permitted_ in the following areas:

**To Apply:** _[Scattering of Cremated Remains Permit Application](/forms/scattering-cremated-remains-permit-application)_

**Applications must be submitted no later than 30 days in advance.**

Once the application has been approved, the Reservations Department will contact you to collect payment for the $50 permit fee. Payment can be made with a Visa/Mastercard. Check payments are also accepted but must be received at least 15 days before the permitted date.

If the scattering does not take place on the original date, the permit is valid for up to one-year from the date of issue. You will need to notify the Reservations Department and the Park Supervisor of the new date in advance.
