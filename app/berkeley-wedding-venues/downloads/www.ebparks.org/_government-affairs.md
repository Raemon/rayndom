## Welcome to the Park District’s Government and Legislative Affairs Page

The Government and Legislative Affairs team works on a local, state and Federal level to support the agency’s projects, programs and communities. Guided by the East Bay Regional Park District’s mission and elected [Board of Directors](https://www.ebparks.org/board-and-staff/board), the Government and Legislative Affairs staff tracks relevant state and Federal funding and policy programs, and maintains relationships with external partners through regular meetings, site visits and events. The Government and Legislative Affairs Department's scope of responsibility includes seven Board Members, eight Federal legislative offices, 11 State legislative offices, 10 County Supervisor offices and 33 cities with 180 council members.

[2024 Legislative Program Document](/sites/default/files/2024-Legislative-Program.pdf)

The Government and Legislative Affairs Department also oversees the [Park Advisory Committee (PAC)](/calendar/public-meetings/park-advisory) which is a 21-member advisory group appointed by the Park District Board of Directors.

As always, information from this page is encouraged to be shared widely in newsletters, e-blasts and on social media! Our staff are available to answer further questions and act as a resource on regional park matters and trends. Please do not hesitate to reach out [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#14537b62557272757d66675471766475667f673a7b6673).

Register and Host Meetings in Our Parks

We are proud to provide open space for our communities to enjoy for their psychological and physical health. Recently, we have valued hosting our meetings in parks at picnic sites and trails. Your office may enjoy using these open spaces for meetings as well!

#### Host a Walk and Talk or schedule a site visit!

  


Please contact the Government Affairs team to schedule a site visit of a Park District park or a community Walk and Talk for an elected official or staff. Reach out at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0e4961784f68686f677c7d4e6b6c7e6f7c657d20617c69) and we would be happy to help.
