## About the Facility

Opened to the public in 1936, the Beach House was built by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to provide accommodation for changing rooms on the ground floor for Lake Temescal visitors and office space (in what is now the event space) on the upper floor that served as the original headquarters for the park district.

The Temescal Beach House is perfect for intimate weddings, celebrations, workshops, and retreats with two separate rooms and a large flagstone patio to spread out in. Our approved caterers and preferred vendors can help you flawlessly execute your event from start to finish. We also offer a DIY non-catered option for reservations that end by 7pm.
