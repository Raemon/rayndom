### Proper Passing Etiquette

There are many opportunities for mountain biking in the parks, and we're working with bicycle advocacy groups to provide more. The old cliche about never getting a second chance to make a first impression is especially true - on hikers, horseback riders, trail runners and other mountain bikers. The most important action mountain bikers can take is to use proper passing etiquette. Be prepared to:

  1. Slow down
  2. Yield on the trail
  3. Communicate - say hello and thank you
  4. Pass safely



### General Park District Rules and Guidelines

  1. Wear a helmet! State law requires all bicyclists under age 18 to wear an approved helmet but it's a good idea for everyone.
  2. Bicycles are not permitted, either walked, ridden, or carried, on trails marked "No Bicycles"
  3. Ride at a safe speed, or not greater than the posted speed limit.
  4. Bicycles must always yield to pedestrians and equestrians. Use extra caution when approaching hikers or equestrians from behind. Before passing from either direction, SLOW DOWN, establish verbal contact, ring bell if necessary. If you're riding with a group, hikers and equestrians especially appreciate a courtesy announcement of how many bikers are behind you.
  5. When approaching equestrians call out and stop whether you are seen or not. Ask for instructions on how to pass safely.
  6. Stay on clearly defined multi-use trails. Do not ride on unauthorized single track trails or cross country.
  7. Be Prepared - cell phones do not work in the majority of Regional Parks so be prepared by telling others where you're going, carrying extra water, and bringing proper repair equipment should you experience a flat tire or some other mechanical breakdown.
