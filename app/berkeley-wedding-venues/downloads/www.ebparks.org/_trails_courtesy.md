## Hikers 

  * Hikers yield to horses; cyclists and skaters yield to hikers and horses.
  * Respect the environment - don't cause damage. Stay on designated trails. Do not cut switchbacks or take shortcuts!
  * Do not pick wildflowers, enjoy their beauty and leave them for others to enjoy.
  * Respect wildlife and their habitat - you are in their home - **do not feed wildlife such as ducks, geese, squirrels, or coyotes**. 
  * Do not litter--pack it in, pack it out. 
  * [Leave No Trace Principles](/visit/leave-no-trace)



## Bikers

  * Cyclists and skaters yield to hikers and horses.
  * Respect the environment - don't cause damage. Stay on designated trails. Do not cut switchbacks or take shortcuts!



### Proper Passing

There are many opportunities for mountain biking in the parks, and we're working with bicycle advocacy groups to provide more. The old cliche about never getting a second chance to make a first impression is especially true - on hikers, horseback riders, trail runners and other mountain bikers. The most important action mountain bikers can take is to use proper passing etiquette. Cyclists must call out and/or ring bike bells when passing. Be prepared to:

  1. Slow down
  2. Yield on the trail
  3. Communicate - say hello and thank you
  4. Pass safely




## Equestrians

  * Hikers, cyclists and skaters yield to horses.
  * Keep your horse to the right or where safe when encountering others on the trail.
  * Communicate - let other trail users know how to pass your horse safely.



## Dog Owners

  * Keep dogs on leash unless it is specifically posted that they can be off leash. Carry a 6-foot leash at all times.
  * Respect wildlife and their habitat - you are in their home.
  * Respect the environment - don't let your dog dig or cause damage.
  * Clean up after your dog. Leave all trails as clean or cleaner than when you arrived.
  * Yield the right-of-way to other hikers. Many people are afraid of dogs. Communicate with others and always keep your dog under control.
  * Yield the right-of-way to equestrians. Move off the trail far enough to allow horses to pass. Keep your dog close to you, quiet and under control.
  * Carry extra water and dog waste bags when hiking with dogs.
  * Set an example for others by being a conscientious owner with a well-behaved dog out enjoying the trails.
