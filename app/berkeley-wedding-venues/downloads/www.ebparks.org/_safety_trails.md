## Planning Your Outing

[Check Alerts and Closures](/alerts)

When planning your hike, consider your physical condition, the length of the trail and level of difficulty, and the predicted weather conditions. You can shorten or lengthen your planned route to meet your ability or to accommodate the weather. Before heading out, always tell a family member or friend where you are going, what trail(s) you are planning to hike, and when you expect to return. Take plenty of water, dress for the weather, and know the location of an emergency phone before you begin. When possible, go with a friend.

Use the following guidelines to determine how far to go and what level of difficulty suits you:

### 

Easy

Easy trails are relatively flat and in good condition (paved or packed gravel). Length varies from 1 to 3 miles, generally taking 1 to 2 hours or less to complete. These trails are generally suitable for strollers.

### 

Moderate

Moderate trails have significant elevation gain (500-1000 feet), are 3-6 miles in length, and trail conditions vary from good to rugged. Hikes generally take 2-4 hours to complete. You must be in good physical condition and carry plenty of water, a high energy snack, and a first aid kit.

### 

Challenging

Challenging trails have significant elevation gain (1000+ feet), 6-20 miles or more in length, and trail conditions can vary from good to rugged. Hikes generally take from 4-8 hours to complete. You be in good physical condition and carry plenty of water, a high energy snack, and a first aid kit.

###

## Tips for Trails Users

Park ranger gives tips for hiking safely.

### 

Hikers

As a general rule for beginners, hiking one mile on relatively flat terrain at a moderate pace takes approximately one-half hour. For hikes labeled “challenging,” or on days when the temperature is over 90 degrees, allow extra time and take more water! Hikers should wear sturdy shoes with ankle support.

### 

Dogs

Carry extra water and dog waste bags when hiking with dogs. Dogs should wear identification in case of separation. Carry a 6-foot leash at all times. Know which parks allow dogs off-leash and where dogs are prohibited.

### 

Cyclists

Bicyclists are more susceptible to fatigue and dehydration when riding in heat and on steep trails. Take PLENTY of water and a high-energy snack. A six to ten-mile route on unpaved fire roads in the East Bay hills is a challenging route for an intermediate rider to complete in two hours. Easier, flatter, paved trails are ideal for family bicycle outings. Always wear a helmet; helmets are required for anyone age 16 or younger. Bring a bicycle tube patch kit and a bike pump in case your bike gets a flat. A bike bell is not required, but is useful for warning others when you are about to pass. Remember to yield to pedestrians. Before passing pedestrians, slow down and call out and/or ring your bike bell to ensure that you can pass safely. When approaching equestrians, call out and/or ring your bell and stop, whether you are seen or not. Ask for instructions on how to pass safely. On blind turns, slow down, call out and/or ring your bell, and ride in single file.

### 

Equestrians

When planning your outing, consider terrain, temperature, humidity, and your horse’s condition. Chart a course that will allow your horse to drink at least once every hour. For an average horse, a hilly, 5 to 7-mile route should take about 1-1/2 hours. Learn to take your horse’s pulse and respiration rate. Always wear a helmet and wear sturdy boots. Keep your horse to the right or where safe when encountering others on the trail, and communicate: let other trail users know how to pass your horse safely.

### 

Wheelchairs

Pavement conditions and steepness of grades are factors to consider when choosing a route suitable for wheelchairs. Wheelchair users tend to get cold faster than walkers or bikers, so bring something to keep warm and dry even if you do not expect cold weather. Traveling with a companion is recommended. See our [Short-Loop Trails](https://www.ebparks.org/activities/hiking/default.htm#ShortLoop) page for recommendations on suitable paved and unpaved trails.

### 

Skaters

Pavement conditions, steepness of grades, and skating ability are factors to consider when choosing a skating route. Paved trails have gentle to medium grades and smooth pavement; however, be prepared to encounter leaf debris, cracks, and uneven surfaces. You should have the ability to safely negotiate around road debris, dogs, bikes, and other trail users while maintaining control. Always wear a helmet, wrist guards, and knee pads.
