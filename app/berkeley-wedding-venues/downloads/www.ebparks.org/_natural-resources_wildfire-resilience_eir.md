# EBRPD Wildfire Hazard Reduction and Resource Management Plan EIR

__Back to top

In compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), this Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) describes the potential environmental consequences that may result from implementation of the East Bay Regional Park District's (EBRPD's) Draft Wildfire Hazard Reduction and Resource Management Plan (Plan). EBRPD is the lead agency for environmental review of the proposed project; this EIR is designed to fully inform EBRPD's decision-makers, other responsible agencies, and the general public of the Plan and the potential consequences of its approval and implementation. The EIR also recommends a set of mitigation measures to reduce or avoid potentially-significant impacts and examines various alternatives to the proposed project.

This Environmental Impact Report (EIR) has been prepared to evaluate the environmental impacts of implementing the East Bay Regional Park District's (EBRPD's) Draft Wildfire Hazard Reduction and Resource Management Plan (Plan). EBRPD developed the Plan to guide ongoing vegetation management activities on EBRPD park lands along the wildland-urban interface to reduce the likelihood of a catastrophic, wind-driven wildfire, such as the 1991 Oakland Hills fire.

EBRPD is the lead agency for environmental review of the proposed project; this EIR is designed to fully inform EBRPD's decision-makers, other responsible agencies, and the general public of the Plan and the potential consequences of its approval and implementation. The EIR also examines various alternatives to the proposed project and recommends a set of mitigation measures to reduce or avoid potentially-significant impacts. A detailed description of the proposed project is provided in Chapter III, Project Description.
