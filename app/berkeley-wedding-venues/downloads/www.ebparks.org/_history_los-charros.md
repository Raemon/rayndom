Contra Loma Today

# Contra Loma Today: The Story of Los Charros

In the early 1970s, a group of residents from East Contra Costa County united with a shared purpose: to preserve and celebrate traditional Mexican cultural and equestrian practices. Their efforts culminated in the founding of the nonprofit Asociación de Charros Los Costeños de Brentwood in 1973. Established by Mexicans and Mexican Americans, the association embraced la charrería—Mexico’s national rodeo sport, recognized for its artistry, horsemanship, and cultural significance. With Contra Loma Regional Park as their home, Los Charros hosted charreadas that connected generations and reinforced a strong sense of cultural identity within the region.

Today, nothing remains at Contra Loma Regional Park to indicate that the Asociación de Charros Los Costeños once gathered there. The sole reminder is a trail—appropriately named Los Charros Trail—that winds through the area

While charreadas and events are no longer held at Contra Loma, equestrian traditions continue to be a vibrant part of the East Bay Regional Parks. Charros remain active in the community, practicing and celebrating their culture, and it is not uncommon to see them riding along many of the Park District’s trails today.

The Making of Contra Loma

# From Unrest to Recreation: The Making of Contra Loma Regional Park

While Los Charros brought cultural vibrancy to the landscape, Contra Loma’s development as a regional park had roots in a very different story. Beyond its role as a gathering place for equestrian traditions, the land also became central to broader community needs—emerging from a moment of social unrest to serve as a public space for recreation, safety, and connection.

![Contra Loma Regional Park Land Use Study Plan](/sites/default/files/los-charros-exhibit-slide-04-v2-pre.jpg?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop) i

Built in 1965 by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to supply the growing water needs of East Contra Costa County, Contra Loma Reservoir, soon became the centerpiece of a new park. Within just three years, in 1968, Contra Loma Regional Park opened, initially on an emergency basis, as a direct response to social unrest in the community. That year, riots erupted in Pittsburg’s El Pueblo neighborhood. Community leaders recognized that one of the underlying problems was the lack of safe recreational spaces for youth.

With Pittsburg located too far from existing East Bay Regional Park District facilities, local officials sent out an urgent call for help. The solution was bold and nearly unprecedented: to transform Contra Loma Reservoir into a park—within weeks. District staff, the General Manager Richard C. Trudeau, and the Board of Directors worked at record speed, negotiating a special agreement with the Bureau and rushing to install essential facilities. By mid-summer, the El Pueblo riots had subsided, and the Pittsburg Chief of Police credited the opening of Contra Loma as a key factor in helping to restore peace.

"I don't think any public agency anywhere ever moved faster than we did to get Contra Loma open,” recalls General Manager Richard C. Trudeau [1968-1985] (in photo, second from right). “We pushed hard, everybody worked together, and we had youngsters on the beach in six weeks.”

A New Era at Contra Loma

# Asociación de Charros Los Costeños: A New Era at Contra Loma Regional Park

The Founders (Los Fundadores)

Following Contra Loma’s establishment as a public park, a new chapter unfolded in its history. By the early 1970s, the site grew beyond its recreational purpose to serve as a cultural gathering place, where Los Charros brought the traditions of la charrería—Mexico’s national rodeo sport—signaling a vibrant new era for the park.

![Abraham Amador, Martin Guzman, José Perez, Arnulfo Ibarra, Celestino Sancen, and Sebastián Ponce](/sites/default/files/los-charros-exhibit-slide-10.jpg?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop) i

Among the founding members of the Asociación de Charros Los Costeños were Abraham Amador, Martín Guzmán, José Pérez, Arnulfo Ibarra, Celestino Sancén, and Sebastián Ponce. To be officially recognized as an association, members had to be credentialed. For this, the Brentwood charros turned to Isaac Fletes, a close friend of founding member Martín Guzmán. Fletes, originally from Jalisco, Mexico, was a well-known and highly respected charro living in Woodland, California. He was regarded as un charro completo—a true charro—because he belonged to an official association in Mexico and was skilled in every traditional event.

With the assistance of Isaac Fletes, a well-known and highly respected charro from Woodland, California, the Asociación obtained its credentials. (Teresa Borrayo Photograph Collection)

In contrast, the Brentwood charros were not “true charros” in the formal sense, although some had experience with aspects of charreada traditions. Under Fletes’s guidance, Los Charros organized themselves, secured the credentials required to be recognized as charros, and acquired the proper trajes de charro (charro outfits or suits), guns, holsters, and other equipment needed. His mentorship was instrumental in establishing the Brentwood Asociación. While the exact year of credentialing is uncertain, it likely occurred in the early 1970s. Years later, Fletes would also help the Sunol Charros become organized and credentialed, though this was after his work with Los Charros of Brentwood.

One of the founding members, Abraham Amador, was a respected Oakley community advocate often referred to as the César Chávez of eastern Contra Costa County. A tireless champion for Mexican immigrants, he assisted families with residency requirements, immigration status, and other essential needs — without ever accepting payment for his work. In 1967, he began working with the United Council of Spanish Speaking Organizations in Brentwood. Nearly a decade later, in 1976, he and his friend Joel López of Oakley founded the Comité Regional Campesino (Regional Farmworker Committee), an all-volunteer organization committed to ensuring that local farmworkers had access to safe housing, health care, and food.

Lease Agreement

# Los Charros and the East Bay Regional Park District: Toward a Lease Agreement

In 1973–1974, Abraham Amador met Jerry Kent, the Assistant General Manager of Operations for the East Bay Regional Park District, through a church-sponsored summer youth camp program. Kent’s church in Lafayette partnered with St. Anthony’s Catholic Church in Oakley, where Amador served as sponsor, to bring together children from the Lamorinda area with those from Antioch and Oakley. Over two weeks of shared summer camps, Amador and Kent developed a friendship that lasted throughout their lives, continuing until Amador’s passing in 2000.

Map of the area designated for the lienzo charro at Contra Loma Regional Park. Situated off Frederickson Lane, near the park’s main entrance, this site is now marked by Los Charros Trail, commemorating where charros once held their events.

It was during this time that discussions began about establishing a lienzo charro—a traditional Mexican rodeo arena. The Mexican and Mexican-American community wanted a space to hold rodeo events on Park District land, and Amador proposed Contra Loma as a potential site. Because the park was still being developed and had little surrounding infrastructure, it was selected as a place to try.

![Letter from Martín Guzmán, President, to the East Bay Regional Park District Board of Directors](/sites/default/files/los-charros-exhibit-slide-17-v2.jpg?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop) i

Letter from Martín Guzmán, President, to the East Bay Regional Park District Board of Directors. On February 19, 1974, the Asociación de Charros Los Costeños attended a Board meeting held in the City Council Chambers of Martinez City Hall, where they presented their proposal to construct a lienzo charro at Contra Loma Regional Park.

Jerry Kent arranged a meeting between Amador and then–General Manager Richard C. Trudeau, who expressed strong interest in creating a cultural arena at Contra Loma. While the Park District already had several American-style arenas devoted to horsemanship, this would have been the first dedicated to the Mexican-American community in East Contra Costa County. Trudeau authorized moving forward with the concept.

By 1973, the Asociación de Charros Los Costeños and the Park District began discussions about leasing land at Contra Loma for a permanent equestrian facility. In the years leading up to this, from 1971 to 1973, the association had occasionally held equestrian events at Contra Loma using temporary facilities under a letter permit issued by Richard Trudeau.

In 1974, motivated by the growing need for a dedicated lienzo charro to practice and showcase traditional horsemanship, the Asociación formally approached Richard Trudeau and Jerry Kent with a request for a 35-acre parcel of land at the southeast end of Contra Loma Regional Park. Although the Park District Board of Directors initially turned down the proposal, approval to develop a lease agreement with the Asociación de Charros Los Costeños at Contra Loma was ultimately granted on May 7, 1974. This represented a new kind of equestrian arena and a new type of event for the Park District. While modest in scale at first, it proved to be a positive addition to both the park and the community, and it functioned successfully.

Community, Tradition, and Celebration

# Charreadas at Contra Loma: Community, Tradition, and Celebration

The site where Los Charros held their events was remote and largely isolated, set apart from the small neighboring towns of Pittsburg, Brentwood, and Oakley. At the time, these towns were small communities, with Brentwood numbering only about 6,000 residents—primarily farm laborers and ranch owners. Few homes surrounded Contra Loma, which gave the gatherings a distinctly open and rural character. The towns were not yet connected as they are today. In the summer, the hills around Contra Loma turned golden with dry grass, dotted occasionally with trees, creating a wide, expansive backdrop for the charreada events.

Visitors entered the lienzo charro at Contra Loma through a designated gate, where admission was charged per person and vehicles were lined up in long rows in a dirt parking lot. The road leading to the site was paved, but beyond it, the grounds were simple and utilitarian. At the center stood the charro arena with its grandstands and livestock stalls for steers and horses, much like any traditional rodeo setting. Surrounding the arena were additional features that created a festive atmosphere: a fenced strip for horse racing, an enclosed booth for beverage sales and storage, and a gazebo-like structure with tables for food service. Picnic tables provided space for families to gather, eat, and enjoy live music.

The charreadas were lively family gatherings, most often held on Sundays, where children played together while parents and relatives watched the competitions. At Contra Loma, events took place monthly and drew charro associations from communities such as Sunol, Dixon, and Woodland. On the other weekends, Los Charros traveled to those same towns, where they were warmly received with food, hospitality, and camaraderie. Following the competitions, it was common for the hosts to organize a dinner and dance, turning the day into a festive celebration that extended beyond the arena and strengthened ties among the participating associations.

The atmosphere at Contra Loma was festive and lively, despite the dusty grounds and limited shade. Families and visitors gathered to enjoy music, food, and community while taking in a variety of competitions. Within the lienzo charro (charro arena), events included traditional cattle roping, the dramatic El Paso de la Muerte—where a rider leapt from a saddled horse onto a running bareback horse—horses performing dances to Mariachi music, and escaramuzas, groups of women in colorful dresses riding sidesaddle in choreographed formations. Many participants traveled from other charro associations in nearby cities, creating a strong sense of regional connection. Outside the arena, spectators watched informal horse races and even foot races, often placing bets with the same excitement as they would on horses. At times, riders also released a steer and, instead of roping it, pursued it on horseback, dragging it down by the tail—a practice later condemned by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) and one of the reasons charro associations often kept their activities within their own circles.

Reinas and the Role of Women

# Reinas and the Role of Women in the Asociación de Charros Los Costeños

Women did not participate in the charro competitions; those events were reserved for men. Instead, young women served as reinas (queens), representing their associations during ceremonies and social gatherings. Before each charreada began, the reina would lead a formal parade into the lienzo on horseback, followed by the team flag, then the American and Mexican flags, with the Charros riding behind. After the procession circled the arena, the women exited, and the charro events commenced.

Being queen was not a yearly title for the Charros, unlike the Fiestas Patrias queens chosen annually for Mexico’s Independence Day on September 16, who were selected through ticket sales and fundraising contests. Rather, Charro associations would invite a young woman from the community to represent them. Reinas were expected to attend parades, appear at monthly charreadas, and travel with their association to events in other towns such as Sunol, Dixon, and Woodland.

Charreada traditions also included fundraising efforts to help cover the costs of a reinas’ attire, which included elaborate dresses and sombreros. Families sometimes sold food at the events, while at the post-charreada dances, reinas raised money by selling decorative ribbons that men wore proudly as a show of support. These events fostered community spirit, blending competition, ceremony, music, and dance into festive gatherings that extended well beyond the charro arena.

Photograph of Lupe Amador’s coronation in 1972 or 1973, when she was about 14 years old. She was the very first reina for the Asociación de Charros Los Costeños. According to Lupe, the ceremony took place outdoors at a charreada event. She recalls: “I was crowned with my white felt sombrero with gold accents (I wear it in some of the photos) by Mr. Guzman in the center of a rodeo arena. I think it was at the Antioch fairgrounds or at another association’s rodeo arena.” The identities of the other two men in the photograph are unknown. (On loan from private collection)

# Lupe Amador

Lupe Amador, daughter of founding member Abraham Amador, participated in Los Charros for many years and was honored as the first reina (queen) of the Asociación de Charros Los Costeños. To prepare for her role, her father took her and her mother to Tijuana, Mexico, where a tailor fitted her with a traje de charra, the traditional women’s rodeo suit. She was “crowned” in 1972 or 1973, just before her fifteenth birthday, with her white felt sombrero with gold accents. For her fifteenth birthday, she received a sterling silver bracelet with a heart-shaped charm engraved on the front with “Reina Lupita 1” and on the back with “Ass. de Charros Los Costeños.” Lupe still treasures this bracelet today.

Lupe wears a dark-colored sombrero, while the other women pictured, also reinas, remain unidentified. Date unknown. (On loan from private collection)

Lupe served as reina for approximately six years, until around 1978, likely chosen in part because of her father’s role as one of the association’s founders. In this role, Lupe took part in charreadas at Contra Loma, traveled with Los Charros to events in other cities, and represented the association in parades and public celebrations.

# Berenice (Barajas) Arteaga

Berenice Arteaga succeeded Lupe Amador as queen of the Asociación de Charros Los Costeños, serving from about 1978 to 1983. She had begun attending events with her family in the early 1970s, and because they were regular participants, the Charros approached her parents, Jesús “Chuy” Barajas and Rosario Chávez Barajas, to ask permission for Berenice to serve as their reina. The Charros allowed her parents to operate a taco stand at the charreadas, selling carne asada tacos to help cover the costs of her dresses, sombreros, and other expenses related to her role. Berenice recalls being involved with the Asociación as early as age thirteen or fourteen, attending Sunday gatherings and traveling with the Charros to events in other communities. Her quinceañera itself was celebrated as a charro event, with her godparents and family members all dressed in traditional charro attire. As reina, she carried out the traditional duties of representing the association at charreadas, parades, and community celebrations.

# Maria Teresa (Sanchez) Borrayo

Teresa Borrayo, born in Corongoro, Michoacán, Mexico, was married to Rafael Borrayo, owner of El Gallito restaurant in Brentwood. She became deeply involved with Los Charros in its early years. When the Asociación was just beginning to organize, Rafael, knowing his wife’s love of horses, mentioned her interest to some of the founding members. Teresa and Rafael went on to spend 12 years with Los Charros, a commitment that required great sacrifice—waking as early as 3 a.m. to prepare food for events, traveling to other cities, and returning home late at night.

![Maria Teresa \(Sanchez\) Borrayo](/sites/default/files/los-charros-exhibit-slide-36.jpg?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop)

Teresa’s horsemanship quickly set her apart. Having grown up on a ranch in Mexico, where horses were the primary means of transportation, she had become a skilled rider. Her ability even sparked good-natured jealousy among some charros, particularly José Pérez, who was teased by others that Teresa rode better than he did.

![Teresa Borrayo on horseback](/sites/default/files/los-charros-exhibit-slide-37.jpg?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop) i

Her participation was possible largely because she was the wife of a charro, though not all wives chose to be as active. While many women supported events by preparing and selling food, Teresa embraced both roles—working behind the scenes and taking part in the action. She rode proudly in parades, where Los Charros frequently won trophies, helping to showcase the group’s spirit and tradition in the wider community.

# Manuel “Chato” Torres

Manuel Torres was born on September 22, 1926, in Atoyac, Jalisco, Mexico. At age 18, he journeyed to the United States with a companion who gave him the nickname “Chato” after teasing him about his short thumbs. They first arrived in Texas before traveling by boxcar to California in search of work. Though trained in Mexico as a mechanic and welder, Manuel initially labored in the fields of Brentwood. As he learned English, local farmers sought his help with various tasks, and in time he returned to his trade as a welder. For more than 15 years, Manuel was an active member of Los Charros, announcing charreadas in Stockton, Modesto, Sunol, and across the region. Well-known in the community, he often served as master of ceremonies, a role he loved. His wife, Luz Torres, recalled that announcing was his passion and described him as both traditional and fun to be around. When Manuel passed on August 28, 2004, the charro community rallied to support his family, raising $6,000 through a raffle of his belongings, including charro outfits and a sombrero. Luz kept only his traje de gala (formal charro suit) as a cherished reminder of his legacy—some of those images are shown here.

![Manuel “Chato” Torres](/sites/default/files/los-charros-exhibit-slide-40.jpg?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop)

i

Manuel Torres’s traje de gala (formal charro suit) represented the highest level of traditional charro attire. Reserved for special occasions, this suit was finely tailored and richly adorned, reflecting both cultural pride and formality. Worn with accessories such as a charro bow and sombrero, the traje de gala symbolized honor and tradition.

![Manuel Torres’s charro bow](/sites/default/files/los-charros-exhibit-slide-42a.jpg?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop) i

Manuel Torres’s charro bow, traditionally worn with his traje de gala, was an essential accessory that completed the formal charro attire.

This example features ornate chains and buttons, each crafted with a horse’s head framed by a horseshoe and accented with acorn-shaped drops. Both functional and symbolic, the botonadura reflects the artistry, elegance, and pride embedded in charro heritage.

Jacket clasp (broche or cierres de charro) from Manuel Torres’s traje de gala. This ornate silver clasp, featuring paired horses’ heads framed by horseshoes, fastens the front of the charro jacket. More than functional, such clasps echoed the design of the buttons and pant adornments.

i

Manuel Torres’s sombrero. This finely crafted charro sombrero, with its wide brim, decorative embroidery, and ornate band, was an essential part of Manuel Torres’s formal attire.

![Espuelas \(spurs\) worn by Manuel Torres](/sites/default/files/los-charros-exhibit-slide-45a-v2.jpg?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop) i

Belt buckle worn by Manuel Torres. This ornate silver buckle features the Mexican national emblem: an eagle perched on a cactus with a serpent in its beak and talon. Worn as part of Manuel Torres’s traje de gala, the buckle not only served a practical purpose but also expressed national pride and cultural identity. Such pieces were integral to charro attire, blending functionality with artistry and symbolism.

![Berenice \(Barajas\) Arteaga](/sites/default/files/los-charros-exhibit-slide-46.JPG?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop)

# Berenice (Barajas) Arteaga

Berenice Arteaga was born and raised in Brentwood, California. She became the second reina (queen) of the Asociación de Charros Los Costeños, succeeding Lupe Amador, and served from about 1978 to 1983. Having attended charreadas with her family since the early 1970s, she was invited by the Charros— with her parents’ permission— to take on the role. To help cover the cost of her dresses, sombreros, and other expenses, her parents operated a taco stand at the events. Berenice remembers being active in the Asociación from age thirteen or fourteen, joining Sunday gatherings and traveling with the Charros to other communities. As reina, she carried out the traditional duties of representing the association at charreadas, parades, and community celebrations. Displayed here is the reina dress she wore while queen, along with two other dresses she often wore.

i

Several views of Berenice Arteaga’s reina dress are shown here. These formal outfits, comparable to “black tie” attire, were made from fabric purchased in California and sent to Charros Guadalajara in Mexico, a workshop specializing in mariachi and charro clothing. Her queen dress was embroidered with silver thread.

i

Formal sombrero belonging to Berenice Arteaga. This elaborately embroidered sombrero was worn with her reina dress and decorated with the same silver thread used in her queen’s dress. Featuring ornate floral motifs and horseshoe designs accented with metallic stitching, the sombrero reflects both elegance and craftsmanship.

i

Several views of Berenice Arteaga’s other formal dress are shown here. Worn when she was not serving as queen, this outfit was used for events where Los Charros were invited as a group. The fabric was purchased in California and taken to Mexico to be tailored. Like her queen dress, it features the same embroidery design, but in gold thread instead of silver.

i

Several views of Berenice Arteaga’s riding dress are shown here. More casual than her queen dress, it was purchased in Mexico and is embroidered with brown leather.

i

Casual sombrero belonging to Berenice Arteaga. This wide-brimmed sombrero, made of felt with a woven decorative band, was used for everyday wear rather than formal occasions. Unlike the heavily embroidered gala sombreros, casual styles like this were practical for riding and daily use while still reflecting the elegance and tradition of charro culture.

# Maria Teresa (Sanchez) Borrayo

Born in Corongoro, Michoacán, México, Teresa Borrayo and her husband Rafael were active with Los Charros for 12 years. Her ranch upbringing made her a skilled horsewoman, and she stood out not only for her riding but also for her dedication—waking up early to prepare food, traveling to events, and returning late at night. Unlike some of the wives who contributed only behind the scenes, Teresa embraced both roles—supporting events and riding proudly in parades where Los Charros often won trophies. On display are Rafael and Teresa Borrayo’s trajes de gala, along with their accessories, other trajes, and photographs of additional dresses worn by Teresa at charro events.

![Maria Teresa \(Sanchez\) Borrayo](/sites/default/files/los-charros-exhibit-slide-52.JPEG?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop)

i

Several views of Rafael Borrayo’s traje de gala are presented here. Purchased in Guadalajara, Mexico, the suit was later completed with its botonadura—the traditional silver buttons running down the pant legs—personally sourced from Isaac Fletes. This elegant attire was reserved for formal occasions such as dances, dinners, and parades. Unlike his traje de faena (working charro suit), this one was never worn during charreadas, as it embodied formality and celebration rather than sport.

i

This sombrero completed Rafael’s traje de gala. Purchased in Mexico City, it added contrast and distinction to the dark suit, giving his formal attire an elegant balance.

![Teresa Borrayo’s traje de gala](/sites/default/files/los-charros-exhibit-slide-54a-v2-new.jpg?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop) i

These images highlight Teresa Borrayo’s traje de gala. In one photograph, the suit is displayed with its cape alongside Rafael’s traje de gala, while the other shows the ensemble with only the vest, emphasizing its versatility and fine detail. Purchased in 1974 from an artisan shop in Mexico City—reportedly run by nuns who specialized in charro suits—this elegant outfit has remained in Teresa’s care for over fifty years.

![silver-embroidered sombrero](/sites/default/files/los-charros-exhibit-slide-54b-v2-new.jpg?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop) i

Though the white, silver-embroidered sombrero belonged to Teresa, Rafael would often borrow it when wearing his traje de gala for special evenings out. Its decorative details made it well-suited for formal occasions. Purchased in Mexico City, it reflects the blend of elegance and practicality in charro attire.

![Pant leg detail from Rafael Borrayo’s traje de gala](/sites/default/files/los-charros-exhibit-slide-55a-new.jpg?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop) i

Pant leg detail from Rafael Borrayo’s traje de gala. This ornate section of the botonadura (decorative row of silver buttons) replaces the traditional simple buttons with silver eagles, each linked by small chains to miniature horseshoe motifs were purchased from Isaac Fletes. The repeating pattern creates a bold visual effect, blending national symbolism—the eagle and serpent—with imagery of horsemanship. Such embellishments showcase the artistry and individuality of charro suits, transforming the pants from functional attire into a statement of pride, identity, and craftsmanship.

Jacket clasp (broche or cierres de charro) from Rafael Borrayo’s traje de gala. This ornate silver clasp fastens the front of the jacket with a row of eagles clutching serpents in their beaks and talons—a powerful national symbol of Mexico. The finely detailed design mirrors the eagle-and-horseshoe motifs along the pant legs, tying the suit’s adornments together. More than functional, such clasps elevated the jacket into a statement of pride, identity, and craftsmanship within the charro tradition.

![Rafael Borrayo’s Funda \(Gun Holster\)](/sites/default/files/los-charros-exhibit-slide-56a-new.jpg?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop) i

Rafael Borrayo’s Funda (Gun Holster). Crafted in Guadalajara, Mexico, this traditional holster blends function with artistry. Its belt is made of durable black leather, while the upper portion is sheathed in silver, intricately engraved with scrollwork and bird motifs. Both functional and decorative, it reflects the craftsmanship and elegance often associated with charro attire and accessories.

Rafael Borrayo’s Espuelas (Spurs). Designed to complement his saddle, these spurs highlight Rafael’s eye for detail and personal style. Crafted in Amozoc de Mota, Puebla, Mexico—a town celebrated for its spur-making tradition—they feature striking chevron-patterned bands, large engraved rowels, and red-and-black woven straps that provide a vivid accent.

![Middle image alt text](/sites/default/files/los-charros-exhibit-slide-57b-new.jpg?q=80&w=1400&auto=format&fit=crop)i

Rafael Borrayo’s Silla de Montar (Saddle). Paired with his matching leather chaps and spurs, this saddle highlights the skilled craftsmanship of traditional charro gear. Draped across the back is a red-and-black woven manta (saddle blanket), which provided comfort for the horse while adding elegance for the rider. The blanket is personalized with Rafael’s last name, “Borrayo,” partially visible in the photo—a detail that speaks to both pride and identity within the charro tradition. Coiled rope and other riding accessories further emphasize the saddle’s use in both practice and display.

Teresa Borrayo’s Espuelas (Spurs). These ornate spurs feature intricate silverwork with intertwined serpents and floral motifs, reflecting the artistry of traditional charro craftsmanship. Tiny pink stones are set into the serpents’ eyes. Like Rafael’s pair, they were purchased in Amozoc de Mota, Puebla, Mexico, a town renowned for its master spur-makers.

On the left is Rafael Borrayo’s traje de faena, made of gamuza (suede) and purchased in Guadalajara at Casa de Charro. Although he did not compete, wearing this suit allowed him to share in the culture and pride of the charreada as a devoted spectator. On the right is Teresa Borrayo’s black gown, richly embroidered with colorful floral patterns. A gift for her 80th birthday, it represents elegance and tradition.

Music at Los Charros

# Sounds of Tradition: Music at Los Charros

Music was an essential part of the gatherings, with live groups performing a variety of styles—sometimes norteña with guitars and accordions, at other times mariachi or banda. After the charro events concluded, the festivities continued into the evening as bands played and families and friends stayed to dance, extending the sense of community and celebration well beyond the arena.

Los Charros called upon not only local musicians but also renowned Mexican singers. Among the performers were Federico Villa, whose ranchera songs were known for their heartfelt emotion, and Cornelio Reyna Cisneros, celebrated as the Godfather of norteño–conjunto music. These well-known artists mingled freely with the crowd, sometimes walking among the visitors just like any other guest, adding to the sense of closeness and shared celebration.

Parades and Events

Los Charros were not limited to hosting charreadas at Contra Loma or visiting other associations for competitions; they were also a visible presence at community celebrations. In local parades, they rode proudly on horseback, dressed in ornate charro suits and wide-brimmed sombreros. Their participation added color, tradition, and pageantry, sharing the pride of charro culture with the broader community.

By the mid-1990s, the charro events at Contra Loma were no longer held as frequently as they once had been, although the Asociación de Charros Los Costeños continued to exist. During this time, the Park District introduced the Festival de la Familia at Contra Loma, creating a new way to celebrate Mexican and Mexican-American culture. These festivals brought the community together to enjoy live music, traditional foods, and performances of ballet folklórico. As part of the festivities, Los Charros staged traditional Mexican rodeos, allowing the community to continue experiencing the heritage of la charrería within a broader cultural celebration.

The End of an Era at Contra Loma

# The End of an Era at Contra Loma: The Culture Lives On

As the popularity of the charreadas grew, the gatherings at Contra Loma began drawing larger crowds, often accompanied by heavy drinking and rowdy behavior. At first, this caused little conflict, as the park—constructed in 1968—was in a remote, rural setting with no nearby homes. Throughout the late 1970s, 1980s, and into the 1990s, the charros seldom faced complaints, since the surrounding land remained largely undeveloped, and the association generally policed its own events without outside intervention.

Aerial photograph of the Los Charros site, June 1993. Taken just before major development altered the landscape, the image shows the charro arena near the center. In the lower right corner, grading shows where new roads and houses were planned. The image captures the moment when housing development began to surround and reshape the open charro grounds.

However, as Antioch expanded and new housing developments spread into the area, the once-isolated site became a residential community. The noise, traffic, and commotion of charro events increasingly clashed with nearby neighborhoods. While the charros themselves remained active, the changing landscape—not the sustainability of the Asociación—brought new challenges. Ultimately, the pressures of urban growth and rising community concerns created growing tensions with the Park District over the appropriateness of holding charro events next to newly built homes. By 2002, Los Charros’ presence at Contra Loma had ended, but their traditions lived on beyond the park.

Although charreada events are no longer held at Contra Loma, the traditions of horsemanship and cultural pride continue across the East Bay Regional Park District. Charros remain an active presence in the community—riding along park trails, gathering for events, and passing their heritage on to future generations—ensuring that the spirit of Los Charros still lives on, even if the arena itself has vanished.

The equestrian tradition continues within the East Bay Regional Park District through the Volunteer Trail Safety Patrol (VTSP). For nearly 15 years, James Mendoza has proudly served as a volunteer rider with the patrol, combining his passion for horsemanship with public service. In addition to patrolling park trails on horseback and assisting visitors, Mendoza represents the Park District at parades, festivals, and community outreach events—showcasing the skills of an equestrian volunteer and strengthening the connection between the parks and the broader community.
