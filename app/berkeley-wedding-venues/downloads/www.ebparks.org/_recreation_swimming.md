## Swimming Facilities

The East Bay Regional Park District swim facilities include six open-water lakefront beaches, two chlorinated lagoons, two pools, and two bay shoreline beaches.

For OPEN/CLOSED status, swim fees, and lifeguard schedule, click on swim facility links below. Walk-ins for all open locations will be available on a first-come, first-served basis until capacity is reached. Cull Canyon and Don Castro also offer an optional swim entry registration on weekends and holidays during the swim season.

Swim entry registration opening schedules are as follow:  
\- April 30 for May  
\- May 5 for June  
\- June 4 for July  
\- July 2 for August and September

  * Please note:
    * Each individual may register up to 10 people total per swim session. All members of the group must enter the swim facility together at the same time. Infants count toward the 10-person limit, so be sure to include them in your registration. If your group is larger than 10, another member of your party will need to complete a separate registration for the additional individuals.
    * Admission will only be granted for the number registered and paid for. The all-day swim pass is valid from 11am - 6pm (everyone must exit water at 5:30pm).
    * Swim entry registration is $6.00/person. This fee is non-refundable/non-transferable.
    * Other Park entry fees, such as parking, may apply.
