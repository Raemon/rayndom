Mission Peak Trail Closure

Some trails will be closed at **Mission Peak Regional Preserve** until March 31, 2026 for gas system upgrades. [See map for more information](/sites/default/files/PGE-alternate-public-access-update.jpg)

Rising steeply to the east of the city of Fremont, Mission and Monument peaks form a dramatic backdrop to the South Bay. The determined and conditioned hiker who reaches the top of Mission Peak will be rewarded with views of Mount Hamilton to the south, the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west, Mt. Tamalpais to the north, and Mt. Diablo and the Sierra Nevada to the northeast. Hawks and vultures share the summit airspace with sailplanes riding the thermals, and a down-to-earth herd of feral goats roams the cliffs.

This well used park, particularly on weekends, with hundreds of visitors attempting the 3-plus-mile hike to Mission Peak. About five hours are required to reach the summit and return. This parkland's 3,023 acres are accessible from parking lots at Ohlone College (slightly longer hike, but more gradual ascent; plenty of parking on weekends) or from a small staging area at the east end of Stanford Avenue in Fremont (steep climb to the summit; parking lot is extremely congested on weekends). There is no access to the park from Mill Creek Road.

The Peak Trail from Ohlone College is an enjoyable hike to the summit that passes a horse corral and through shaded woodlands and open grasslands. This trail is part of the Bay Area Ridge Trail, a planned 550+-mile multi-use trail (currently over 330 miles are complete) along the hill and mountain ridgelines ringing the San Francisco Bay Area. The college charges a $4 parking fee. Parking lot vending machines take cash or credit cards. See the [Ohlone College parking information webpage](http://www.ohlone.edu/core/mapsdirs/parking/visitor.html "http://www.ohlone.edu/core/mapsdirs/parking/visitor.html") to confirm fee information.

The Stanford Avenue staging area is also the western access to the Ohlone Wilderness Trail, a 29-mile hiking and riding trail through some of southern Alameda County's most beautiful wilderness.

### Safe Hiking Tips

Every year, several dogs die of heat stroke and dehydration at Mission Peak and many hikers suffer injuries, as well. Consider these tips while hiking in the park:

#### Water, Water, Water!!!

  * Bring at least 2 liters of water for you and your dog. 
  * Make sure your companions also have enough water. 
  * Offer water to your dog every time you drink some.



#### Be Sun Smart

  * Wear a hat and generously re-apply sunscreen. 
  * Avoid hiking in the middle of the day in the summer months. 



#### Dog Health and Safety

  * Dogs are much more susceptible to heat stroke than humans. Hike with your dog only in cooler temperatures.
  * Take rests and offer water frequently.
  * Watch for signs of heatstroke, which include heavy panting, dry gums, weakness, and inattention. 



#### Sturdy Footwear

  * [Hiking boots and athletic shoes with ankle support are recommended!](/sites/default/files/mission_peak_shoe_poster.pdf "Shoe Poster") [PDF]
  * Thick socks help minimize blisters and absorb moisture.
  * Do not wear flip-flops, sandals or high heels. 



### Trail Restoration

#### Restoration of “The Scarface” Continues!

The Park District continually works to remove bootleg trails and restore the natural beauty of the hillside near the Mission Peak summit, where it’s been eroded over the years due to hikers leaving the designated trail. We’ve installed fences and signs to educate the public and direct hikers to stay on the marked paths.

Please help the restoration effort by staying on the marked trails. Do not take shortcuts. [Press release](/about-us/whats-new/news/restoration-work-begin-soon-mission-peak) on restoration work, 2014.

#### Preserving the beauty of Mission Peak

Irvington High School student volunteers, members of the Mountain Goats bicycle club, and District staff helped restore more than ½-mile of trail in 2012 and 2013. They installed fencing, jut net blankets, eco-wattles, and grass seeds, in hopes of stabilizing the slope and preventing erosion. They also installed signs to educate visitors about the importance of staying on marked trails, and the efforts underway to protect the park’s natural beauty.

#### How can you help?

For more tips and volunteer opportunities, see "[A Restoration Story](/sites/default/files/MissionPeak_TrailRestorationPoster.pdf "2014-05-24 Trail Restoration Poster")" and [Mission Peak Needs Your Help!](/parks/mission-peak/mission-peak-needs-your-help)

\- Stay on designated trails  
\- Avoid entering restoration areas  
\- Avoid creating new “bootleg” trails
