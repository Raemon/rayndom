If your group meets at a school, the school’s lunch program data will be used. After you apply, please email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b0c0d1c2dbc3c4c2d1dec3c0dfc2c4d1c4d9dfdef0d5d2c0d1c2dbc39edfc2d7) with a signed statement on organization letterhead (attached as a PDF), stating how your organization qualifies.

### Is this OK with my School District or Organization?
