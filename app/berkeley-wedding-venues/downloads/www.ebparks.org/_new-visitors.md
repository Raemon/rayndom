## Explore Your Regional Parks

Welcome to the Regional Parks. We hope that you’ll enjoy exploring the parks and shorelines and participating in outdoor activities from archery, hiking to swimming. Spending time in nature is a great way to build physical health, mental relaxation, and social connection. For a safe and positive experience, please observe the following:

## General Info

  * The [Parks](/parks) page can help you select a park location and activity.
  * Parks have different **opening and closing times**.  
Some parks have fees for parking, etc.  
Each park has a webpage for info on hours, fees, programs, attractions, maps, directions, history, and more.
  * Be familiar with the [Park Rules and Regulations](https://www.ebparks.org/public-safety/ordinance-38).
  * Bring plenty of **water for you and your dog** to prevent dehydration.
  * Restrooms are available at many parks. Review [park maps](https://www.ebparks.org/maps) for restroom locations.
  * Learn about [Accessible ADA](/ada-accessibility) facilities and amenities.
  * Check [AT&T, T-Mobile & Verizon Coverage](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/f48944466b004c26bd0e9524ae3f3323). Select 'Map Layers' and switch on 'No Data Coverage Areas'.
  * Pack out your trash. **Do not leave trash and bags of dog waste on trails**. They contaminate the land and waterways. The Park District is one of the most [dog-friendly](/safety/dogs) agencies in the nation. We need dog owners' help to keep parks and trails environmentally safe for everyone. 
  * Tips for [visiting parks with children](/safety/kids).
  * Bringing your dog - read general rules about [hiking with dogs](/safety/dogs) in the parks.
  * **Parking safely and correctly** \- do not block neighbors’ driveways, roadways, emergency exits, or service access roads.
  * Permits - some activities in the Regional Parks require a [permit](/rentals-and-permits/permits).
  * Membership - purchase a [membership](https://www.regionalparksfoundation.org/join/membership) for the most affordable way to regularly enjoy your Regional Parks. Enjoy the [COMPASS magazine](https://www.ebparks.org/publications-media/print/rpf-compass) and the [Regional in Nature](/whats-new/rin) (an activities newsletter) which are included with the membership.
  * **Please do not feed wildlife such as ducks, geese, squirrels, or coyotes**. 
  * Do not release animals in parks and lakes, such as [domestic cats](/natural-resources/biodiversity/biodiversity-protection), fish, turtles or birds.



## Before Heading Out

  * View the list of [Alerts and Closures](/alerts-closures). Be aware of Fire Danger levels and follow all fire use restrictions.
  * Check the weather forecast for the selected park. If necessary, bring layers of clothing. 
  * Maps - at home, download a [Park Map PDF](/maps) or a [GeoPDF Map](/maps) (download for free with the Avenza App).  
View [Interactive Map](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/f48944466b004c26bd0e9524ae3f3323).
  * If you need cell service, check [AT&T, T-Mobile & Verizon Coverage](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/f48944466b004c26bd0e9524ae3f3323). Select 'Map Layers' and switch on 'No Data Coverage Areas'.

  * Bring a dog leash (6-foot max.) and dog waste bags.
  * Understand park usage, and [Park Rules and Regulations](https://www.ebparks.org/public-safety/ordinance-38).
  * Browse the [Calendar](/calendar) for programs and events. 
  * View programs/events at [all visitor centers](https://www.ebparks.org/programs/naturalists).
  * If going swimming, check [Swim Facilities](/recreation/swimming) for OPEN/CLOSED status. Closures may be due to blue green algae, low water levels, renovation, or seasonal closures.
