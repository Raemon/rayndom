![District Memorial Bench Program](/sites/default/files/styles/original_600w_/public/District_Memorial_Bench_Program_650w.jpg?itok=Fmzk5K2n)

District Memorial Bench Program

The Memorial Bench Program is designed to allow the public to honor special people or events in their lives at East Bay Regional Parks. Through the program, each Bench Sponsor will pay to the Park District the sum of $5,000.00 (five thousand dollars). The Bench Sponsor fee includes one 4” x 6” bronze plaque, a Park District standard bench, and basic maintenance. A limit of one optional second plaque is available for $1,000.

### Important Information

#### Bench Maintenance

There is a ten-year bench maintenance and plaque replacement guarantee. Maintenance of all benches will be the responsibility of the Park District, including graffiti removal and sanding, as needed. If a bench plaque is stolen or if the bench is damaged beyond basic maintenance, the Park District will fully restore the bench one time during the duration of the agreement. Full details will be listed in the current term agreement.

#### Plaques

A bronze dedication plaque with a personalized inscription will be mounted on each sponsored park bench. The standard dedication plaque measures 4" x 6". The sentiment on the plaque is limited to five lines, with 30 characters per line (including spaces). Upon installation, the ten-year term agreement will begin, and basic maintenance will be the responsibility of the Park Operations Department. The bench sponsor will have the option at the end of the agreement to obtain the plaque.

#### Payment for Bench Fee

The Memorial Bench fee payment may be submitted through the Online Payment Portal or via check. The East Bay Regional Park District Online Payment Portal allows you to make payments using a checking account. The payment portal does not accept credit cards. The full details will be sent to the approved Bench Sponsor.

#### Bench Availability

Memorial benches currently available are installed in the respective parks, and new benches are not being added to the program. The website will be updated annually or as needed. Benches are available on a first-come, first-served basis when posted.

The benches available for sponsorship have been pre-designated for the program. View the available Bench IDs by selecting the Parks listed below. Each park will show the Bench ID, Google maps location, and a photo of the current bench.
