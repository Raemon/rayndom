Shady Glen Trail Closure

The Shady Glen Trail is currently at **Sunol Wilderness Regional Preserve** closed. Updated January 23, 2026.

## 

No Open Fires or Barbecues

No open fires or barbecues of any type. Gas-fueled stoves are permitted at **Alameda Grove** and **School Camp** only.

Bedrock mortars used by Native Americans for pounding acorns that were found in the area are reminders of Sunol's first inhabitants. For the past century, however, the land known today as Sunol Wilderness Regional Preserve was used almost exclusively as ranch land. Under the East Bay Regional Park District's multi-use land management policy, cattle continue to graze in the 6,859-acre wilderness. Today, camping, picnicking, hiking and back-packing attract thousands of park visitors a year. Visitors should bring drinking water because there is no drinking water in the park.

The Sunol naturalist staff provides additional opportunities to enjoy the park by leading nature hikes and coordinating special events. They also teach about natural and cultural history to children that meet current State Science and Social Science Curriculum Standards during the school year.

Sunol Visitor Center

Turn right at the exit onto Calaveras Road and proceed about four miles to a left turn onto Geary Road, which leads directly into the park. (If you find yourself driving uphill on a narrow winding road you’ve missed the Geary Road turnoff.) To reach the Old Green Barn take the first left after the park entrance.  
  
From the Oakland-Berkeley area, drive east on I-580 to the junction with I-680. Take I-680 south and exit at Calaveras Road/Highway 84 just south of the Sunol exit. At the bottom of the exit turn left onto Calaveras Road and proceed as noted above.  
  
From the Walnut Creek - Danville area, drive south on I-680 and exit at Calaveras Road/Highway 84 just south of the Sunol exit. Proceed as noted above.

## Attractions

### Sunol Visitor Center

Naturalist staff at the[ Sunol Visitor Center](/parks/visitor-centers/sunol) welcome you to the park. Ask for trail suggestions, learn about recent animal sightings and meet our animal ambassadors – a gopher snake, rattle snake, western toad, western pond turtle, and a tarantula. You can also take a peek at the Sunol Herbarium, samples of over 600 plant specimens found in the park!

### Geology

Exploration will reveal sandstone outcrops with fossils deposited in what was once ancient seabed. Great boulders of greenstone, schist and metachert indicate a turbulent past. The massive basalt outcrop at Indian Joe Cave Rocks provides sport and challenge to rock climbers.

### Vegetation

Alameda Creek, Alameda County's largest stream, harbors an inviting creekside community of alder, willow and sycamore. Coast live oaks abound along with valley and blue oak, elderberry, madrone and gray pine. Spring brings wildflowers, including California poppies, mustard, goldfields and lupines, which carpet vast areas in yellow, orange and blue. A wildflower identification kit may be checked out at the Visitor Center.

### Animals

Ground squirrels, yellow-billed magpies and red-tailed hawks share this wilderness with raccoons, skunks and black-tailed deer. Mountain lions are uncommon, but are occasionally sighted. Birding is superb along Alameda Creek with acorn woodpecker, black phoebe, titmouse, turkey vulture, and golden eagle commonly sighted. As many as 20 to 40 bird species are often seen in a single morning.

### Sunol Backpack Area 

Camping is by reservation only, made 2 or more business days in advance. Visit the [Camping page](/recreation/camping) for more information, and call Reservatons to reserve.

### Ohlone Wilderness Trail

*** **As of 1/1/2026** , an Ohlone permit will NOT be required and no additional permits will be sold. No refunds for permits purchased in 2025. Backpacking reservations are still required if you plan on staying overnight. ***

[Download the Ohlone Wilderness Regional Trail Hiking Map (PDF)](/sites/default/files/Ohlone-Wilderness-Permit-Map-11x17.pdf?linkLoc=sunolPage).

Camping at designated campsites along the Ohlone Wilderness Trail is allowed by advance reservation only (2 or more business days in advance). Visit the [Camping page](/recreation/camping) for more information, and call Reservations to reserve. For general information about the Ohlone Wilderness, phone 1-888-EBPARKS, option 3 x4559. Separate reservations may be made for overnight camping at Del Valle Regional Park (outside the Ohlone Wilderness and at the north end of the Ohlone Trail). Visit the [Camping page](/recreation/camping) for more information, [book a Del Valle Regional Park campsite online](https://www.reserveamerica.com/), or call Reservations to reserve.

### Alameda Creek Overlook (Formerly known as Little Yosemite)

The Alameda Creek Overlook is a scenic gorge on Alameda Creek about two miles upstream from the Visitor Center. It is open to the public through a lease agreement with the San Francisco Water Department, which owns the property. Please abide by the boundary signs and do not trespass onto Water Department lands that are not part of the lease arrangement.  
**Notice:** Swimming or wading is NOT allowed in Alameda Creek or any other area in Sunol Wilderness Regional Preserve due to the endangered species that call these waters home.

### Naturalist Programs

Naturalist-led activities include walks, hikes, birding outings, family activities, nature arts and crafts, virtual programs and various other adventures. Visit the Sunol Visitor Center for information about these programs. View all [naturalist-led programs](https://www.ebparks.org/programs/naturalists).

### Hiking

Please do not short cut trails in steep areas or slide in the grass on hillsides or banks. Erosion is ugly and expensive to control. See Trail Mileage for a description of selected hikes.

### Picnicking

Alameda Grove picnic area is available for reservation, by phone only. For more information, visit the [Sunol Picnic Area](/recreation/picnics/sunol-picnic-area) page, and call Reservations to reserve.
