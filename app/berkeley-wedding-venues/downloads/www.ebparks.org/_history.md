## Stories of Park District History and Heritage

The East Bay Regional Park District of today is the result of decades of hard work by innumerable park advocates, community activists, [elected district directors](/board-and-staff/board/former), general managers, district employees, environmental organizations, public officials, volunteers, and taxpayers who have collaborated to ensure that residents in this region will have access to a system of magnificent regional parklands.

## Visit our **EBRPD Oral History Transcriptions for the Web Website**

In the early 1970s, the first oral history interviews were conducted by East Bay Regional Park District staff to preserve the history of the park district and its individual parklands. The East Bay Regional Park District has since accumulated several hundred oral history interviews districtwide with the help of park staff, contractors, university students and other local agencies. Today, the Archives Department’s Oral History Program continues to record new oral history interviews.
