# Earth Day

__Back to top

## Celebrate Earth Day with the Park District

Every day is Earth Day in the Park District, and there are all kinds of ways to celebrate and honor the Earth. Join us for an Earth Day themed activity, take a hike or ride in nature, or volunteer at an Earth Day clean-up event in a park or in your neighborhood. Events are scheduled throughout the month of April.

Earth Day is both a celebration of the natural environment we enjoy in the Regional Parks, and a reminder of our responsibility to take care of it. This year's Earth Day theme is Planet vs. Plastics and advocates for an overall reduction of plastics worldwide. This includes investment in the land, resources, and people to support this unique system of natural and cultural resources and open spaces. Preservation of parks and trails is a core part of the Park District's [mission](/about/mission-vision).

Stay tuned for Earth Day 2026 Events on **April 22, 2026**.
