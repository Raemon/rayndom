Many Regional Parks have barrier-free parking spaces, picnic areas, restrooms, drinking fountains, trails, and visitor centers. Roberts Regional Recreation Area has a barrier-free, wheelchair-accessible children's play area. The District works continuously to develop accessible facilities within its parks as part of its policy of responding to the outdoor recreation needs of everyone living in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties. Please refer to our [Public Transit](/visit/public-transit) page for numerous resources in assisting you in your travels to the Regional Parks.

  * [Short Loop Trails](/trails/short-loop) \- Suitable for senior citizens, persons in wheelchairs, parents with small children or with children in strollers.



## Beach Access

Beach wheelchairs are available at the following swimming lakes and beaches:

  * [Crown Memorial State Beach](/parks/crown-beach) in Alameda
  * [Del Valle](/parks/del-valle) in Livermore
  * [Don Castro](/parks/don-castro) in Castro Valley

  * [Quarry Lakes](/parks/quarry-lakes) in Fremont
  * [Shadow Cliffs](/parks/shadow-cliffs) in Pleasanton

Beach wheelchairs, intended to provide a means for wheelchair users to travel across the beach, are available for free on a first-come, first-serve basis. They are not intended to enter the water. To reserve a chair, call the park office prior to visiting. A staff member will bring the chair out to the beach. It takes approximately 15 minutes to prepare the chair. Staff will give a brief orientation of the chair's use and arrange a time for the chair to be returned.

## Playground Access

[Roberts Regional Recreation Area](/parks/roberts) in the Oakland hills is home to the only specially designed barrier-free playground in the Bay Area and one of the largest playgrounds of its kind in the state.

## Fishing Pier & Dock Access

In 2006, [Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area](/parks/quarry-lakes) in Fremont unveiled a new $1.5 million accessible fishing pier. The pier juts far into Horseshoe Lake, one of Quarry's three lakes, to provide superb fishing opportunities or just an opportunity to get out onto the water. The fishing lakes are regularly stocked with rainbow trout and channel catfish.

[Temescal Regional Recreation Area](/parks/temescal) includes a wheelchair-accessible fishing dock and picnic table - located on East Shore Trail. Learn more about the [ADA Fishing Dock at Temescal](/temescal-fishing-pier) and the Lee family who raised major funds for its construction.

## Recreation Programs

Many of the Park District's recreation programs are accessible. Every two months, the District's activity guide Regional in Nature lists dozens of programs ranging from outdoor photography, introduction to fishing, nature study programs, children's summer day camps, and much more. A PDF version of the guide can be downloaded online by visiting the [Activity Program Guide](/whats-new/rin) webpage or can be requested via mail by calling 1-888-EBPARKS or [1-888-327-2757](tel:1-888-327-2757) (press option 5, then 2, then 1).

## Use of Other Power-driven Mobility Devices

The Park District is pleased to increase recreational opportunities for people with mobility disabilities by allowing the use of other power-driven mobility devices ("OPDMD") in areas where they can be operated safely, without posing risk of serious harm to natural and cultural resources, and in conformity with federal land management laws and regulations.

In order to ensure that OPDMD operation does not pose significant safety risks nor fundamentally alter the nature of services, programs, and activities provided by the Park District, all OPDMDs operated in regional parklands must meet the standards below.

This policy applies only to OPDMD (non-wheelchair) usage. In accordance with federal law, wheelchairs and manually-powered mobility aids, such as walkers, crutches, canes, braces, and other similar devices are permitted anywhere in the Park District where pedestrian travel is allowed.

  * Download: [Use of Other Power-driven Mobility Devices (PDF)](/sites/default/files/Final-OPDMD-Policy-Adopted1162018.pdf)



## Website Accessibility 

East Bay Regional Park District is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We continue to make changes to improve the user experience for everyone and apply the relevant accessibility standards.

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/ "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines") (WCAG) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.

Wherever possible, East Bay Regional Park District will aim to adhere to level AA of the WCAG 2.1 guidelines, which states that sites should be:

  * Perceivable - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
  * Operable - User interface components and navigation must be operable.
  * Understandable - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
  * Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including [assistive technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology).



We welcome your feedback on the accessibility of the East Bay Regional Park District website. If you have experienced any accessibility barriers while using any part of [ebparks.org](https://www.ebparks.org/), please let us know:
