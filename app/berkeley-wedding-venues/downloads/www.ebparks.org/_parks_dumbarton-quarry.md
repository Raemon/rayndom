## History

Tuibun Ohlone Indians inhabited a nearby village for 2,000 years before the arrival of Europeans. Their descendants preserve Ohlone culture with programs and special events at adjacent Coyote Hills Regional Park. Subsequent land use has included ranching and farming. 

Dumbarton Quarry was in operation from the 1950s through 2007. The gravel was used to build parts of San Francisco and Oakland International Airports, highways, and many other projects. Quarrying changed a 190-foot hill into a pit 22 acres across and 320 feet below sea level at the deepest point, making it the lowest human-made elevation in North America.

Filling the pit with clean fill from Bay Area construction projects, East Bay Regional Park District, in partnership with The DeSilva companies, including Dumbarton Quarry Associates, Pacific States Environmental Contractors, Inc., and DeSilva Gates Construction, and with the assistance of the City of Fremont, transformed the depleted quarry into a beautiful new recreational resource. Trails connect the campground to adjacent Coyote Hills and the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge for hiking, bicycling, picnicking, and viewing of the abundant wildlife.
