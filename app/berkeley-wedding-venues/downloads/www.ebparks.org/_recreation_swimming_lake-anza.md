Swimming

Image

![Tilden Lake Anza Swim Beach](/sites/default/files/styles/original_800w_/public/tilden-lake-anza-swim-beach-6-800w.jpg?itok=Dd4d7qLV)

Located in [Tilden Regional Park](/parks/tilden), just over the hill from Berkeley, Lake Anza is a favorite getaway. Its sandy beach is open to the sun and sheltered from the wind, with lifeguards posted during the swim season.

### Swim Capacity

Once the swim facility capacity is reached, there will be no new entries allowed for the remainder of the day. Please take this into consideration when you are planning your visit.

## Swim Beach Water Quality Program

Lake Anza is tested for bacterial levels weekly from April to October. The map below indicates the sample sites on the beach. The East Bay Regional Park District works with the Alameda County Environmental Health Department in accordance with California Department of Public Health's Guidance for Fresh Water Beaches to determine water quality at Lake Anza. Our stop light sign is used to display the relative water quality from our latest bacteriological tests  _and_ blue-green algae conditions. Blue-green algae signage and designations are posted below our bacteriological result designations.

**Water Quality Stop Light Designations:**

**Please be advised there is always some level of risk when swimming in any water body**. To have a fun and safe experience swimming in the parks, we encourage you to follow a few simple rules:

  * Keep water out of your mouth
  * After you leave the water, shower and towel dry as soon as possible 
  * Do not swim in the lake for 3 days after a rainstorm
  * Check posted signs for water quality information



For more information, visit the [Water Quality Stop Light Designations](/water-quality-stop-light-designations) page or contact the East Bay Regional Park District Water Management Department at [(510) 544-2328](tel:1-510-544-2328)
