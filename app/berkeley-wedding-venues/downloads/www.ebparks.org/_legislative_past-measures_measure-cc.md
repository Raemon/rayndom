### About Measure CC

On June 5, 2018, the East Bay Regional Park District Board of Directors unanimously placed an extension measure on the Nov. 2018 ballot to continue local, voter-approved funding in the cities of Oakland, Berkeley, Richmond, Alameda, San Pablo, El Cerrito, Albany, Emeryville, and Piedmont - with no increase in taxes.  
  
If approved by voters, the measure would simply continue existing Measure CC funding to protect against wildfires, restore natural areas, and maintain public access to Regional Parks. Thank you to to those who attended our public meeting or provided input.  
  
Measure CC was passed by Oakland, Berkeley, Richmond, Alameda, San Pablo, El Cerrito, Albany, Emeryville and Piedmont voters in 2004 with 67.6% support to provide local funding for park infrastructure, maintenance, safety, and services. Measure CC is a $12/year parcel tax. Measure CC is set to expire in 2020.

### Measure CC has resulted in:

#### Public Safety, Wildfire Prevention, and Healthy Forests

Measure CC funds support police protection at the shoreline and urban regional parks, as well as fire protection in the East Bay hills. Thanks to Measure CC over 500 acres of urban forests and brush along the ridgelines from Castro Valley to Richmond have been thinned or removed – helping prevent catastrophic fires and maintain safe and healthy forests. Each year, the Park District spends over $1.6 million on [fire hazard reduction](https://www.ebparks.org/about/stewardship/fuelsplan/default.htm)– much of it thanks to Measure CC.

#### Park Infrastructure & Maintenance

Thanks to Measure CC many regional parks, trails and open spaces in western Alameda and Contra Costa counties have been repaired and upgraded, including visitor centers, staging areas, trails, picnic tables, restrooms, and water fountains, among others – ensuring quality public access and recreational opportunities for visitors.

#### Environmental Stewardship & Habitat Protection

Thanks to Measure CC, many natural areas in western Alameda and Contra Costa counties have been restored and preserved, including shorelines, marshes, wetlands, and urban creeks – protecting sensitive habitat for endangered species and preparing parks for the future impacts of climate change.

#### Examples of Measure CC-funded improvements and services

  * New amenities including new bathrooms and hand-washing stations at the Little Farm in Tilden in Berkeley and upgraded infrastructure to help preserve Wildcat Creek and provide an excellent visitor experience.
  * The restoration of Dotson Family Marsh along with new trails and public access, and new entrance at Point Pinole in Richmond.
  * Public access improvements including improved trails at [McLaughlin Eastshore State Park](/parks/mclaughlin-eastshore) and preparations for the future opening of the Brickyard Site along the Berkeley shoreline.
  * Enhancing urban forest health and preventing wildfires with preservation and maintenance along the East Bay ridgelines across multiple cities and communities.
  * Improved access to the [Crab Cove Visitor Center](https://ebparks.org/parks/venues/crab-cove-visitor-center) at [Crown Beach](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/crown_beach/default.htm) in Alameda, and increased staffing capacity at the Visitor Center.
  * New trails, benches, and more at the [Martin Luther King Jr. Shoreline](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/martinlking/default.htm) and Tidewater Boating Center in Oakland.
