## Wild Animals

Coyotes, bobcats, deer, elk, wild pigs, and mountain lions are occasionally spotted in the parks. Their normal reaction is to run away. Some have become used to our presence and will continue their activities while being watched. Never feed, try to approach, or pet wild animals. Keep pets and small children near you in wilderness areas. Because of their size, these animals could become dangerous should they be surprised, confronted, or if they begin to associate humans with food.

If you would like more information on wildlife to watch for, ask for brochures at [Regional Parks Visitor Centers](/parks/visitor-centers).

## Snakes

Although most snakes found in California are harmless, the northern pacific rattlesnake can deliver a venomous bite if provoked. Its coloration allows it to blend in with the soil, providing excellent camouflage. Rattlesnakes and gopher snakes have similar coloration, therefore rattlesnakes are often mistaken for its harmless cousin. Use caution and avoid any snake you see in the wild.

### What to do if bitten by a snake

If bitten by a rattlesnake, stay calm and have someone call 9-1-1. The victim should remain calm by lying down with the affected limb lower than the heart. Wash the wound, if possible. (Rattlesnake bites are typically associated with intense, burning pain.) If you are by yourself, walk calmly to the nearest source of help. DO NOT RUN! If bitten by another kind of snake, wash the wound with soap and water or an antiseptic and seek medical attention.

## Coyotes

As visitation to East Bay Regional Parks increases in warmer months, encounters with coyotes become more common. Coyotes are native to California and are found in various wildland habitats, as well as in rural and urban areas. They hold cultural and ecological importance throughout the state.  
  
Coyote parents are active and protective of den sites from spring through fall, when new pups are born. It is a normal reaction for them to run away when spotted, although some have become used to human presence and will continue their activities while being watched. Visitors are encouraged to keep coyote safety precautions in mind when visiting Regional Parks throughout the year.
