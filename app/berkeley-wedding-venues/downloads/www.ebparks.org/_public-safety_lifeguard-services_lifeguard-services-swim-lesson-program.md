# Swim Lesson Program

__Back to top

## Swim Lessons

The East Bay Regional Park District Swim Program offers inclusive programming with an American Red Cross course format for persons of all abilities.  
If you are interested in teaching your child how to swim, looking to increase your child’s ability and comfort level in a pool, or wanting to learn to swim yourself, Lifeguard Services has the swim lesson program perfectly suited to fit your needs. 

Classes are four to six students per instructor. All instruction is conducted with emphasis on personal safety and fun. Refer to the lesson descriptions to determine placement. If the participant requires disabled accommodations, please contact Aaron Roth at [(510) 690-6624](tel:\(510\) 690-6624), or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f3b2a19c879bb396918392819880dd9c8194), about specific accommodations needed.

### Swim Lesson Descriptions

Classes are organized by both age and ability. Advancing levels are rewarded upon the student’s successful mastery of the requisite skills.

#### Parent Tot: (Adults with Children: 6 months-3years)

This is a fantastic opportunity for children to enjoy the water while being accompanied by a parent/adult. Instructors will guide parents in teaching their children. This class is designed to help children become comfortable in the water and acclimate them to the swim lesson environment and instructors in preparation for joining our “Super Tots” program.

#### Super Tots: (Children: 3-5 years)

This is a great opportunity for “super tots” to have fun and learn new skills without parents. Skills range from entry level to advanced. All students will be assessed at  
the beginning of the session and placed in groups according to skill level and class size. This class is designed to help students prepare for our “Learn-to-Swim” program. No previous swimming experience is necessary.

#### Learn-to-Swim: (Children: 5-13 years)

Level I-IV participants do not need to select a specific class level when registering. On the first day of each session, all participants will be assessed to ensure appropriate class placement. Swimmers will be assigned to a class with other students at similar skill levels. Lessons will have a 6:1 student to-teacher ratio and will be tailored to meet each student’s needs. Level 5 and 6 Learn-to-Swim are offered on a more limited basis.

#### Teen/Adult: (Ages 14 +)

If you are afraid of the water or if you’ve just never learned to swim, this is the class for you! If you have some swimming skills but wish to advance, this class will also meet your needs. Participants will be guided through water adjustment, buoyancy drills, and stroke technique in a low-pressure, supportive environment.

#### Adaptive Lessons

Adaptive lessons are available in any level. Please sign up for group lessons at your desired time and location and contact the Roberts Pool Lifeguard Staff at [(510) 544-3157](tel:\(510\) 544-3157) regarding your swimming goals and specific needs.
