__Back to top

The abundant and diverse assortment of birds, mammals, reptiles, and invertebrates that dwell in the regional parks is an integral part of the ecology of the San Francisco Bay Area and an aesthetic natural feature of the parks that visitors greatly enjoy. The terrestrial wildlife found within the parks occupies a variety of habitats. Most species are native and adapted to the California landscape and climate. The District manages animals that are not native to the region or are feral (domestic animals that have returned to a wild, untamed condition) to minimize conflicts with native species. The District is responsible for the protection of all wildlife, including animals that are state and federally listed as rare, threatened, and/or endangered, and others that are of local concern. Certain additional species, whose specific habitat requirements limit their population size and distribution, may require special management to reduce the potential for isolation or loss of the population.

Visit the [Biodiversity Protection](/natural-resources/biodiversity/biodiversity-protection) page to learn how the District protects wildlife.

## Protecting Wildlife

The District is committed to protecting endangered wildlife and is especially concerned about four shoreline species: the California least tern, California Ridgway’s rails, western snowy plovers, and salt marsh harvest mice. If these birds and mice were widespread and common, we wouldn’t be as worried, but these species have lost about 95% of their tidal wetland habitat and are all listed as either threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.

Sometimes well-meaning park visitors believe they are giving an animal an opportunity for living a good life, but the reality is that domestic animals and pets released in the parks cannot fend for themselves and often starve, fall victim to diseases, or become prey to larger animals. In addition, introduced domestic animals often compete with native animals and cause disruptions in the food web.

Visit the [Biodiversity Protection](/natural-resources/biodiversity/biodiversity-protection) page to learn how the District protects wildlife.
