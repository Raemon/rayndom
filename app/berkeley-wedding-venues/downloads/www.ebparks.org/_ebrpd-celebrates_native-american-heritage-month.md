# Native American Heritage Month

__Back to top

## Celebrating Native American Heritage Month

Join us in celebrating Native American Heritage Month in November as we honor truth in history and awareness of contemporary issues facing the Native communities throughout the East Bay, the nation, and the world.

Indigenous peoples are closely connected to the land through distinct traditions, unique languages, and sophisticated knowledge systems. In the Bay Area, many individuals from the Ohlone, Bay Miwok, Delta Yokut, and many more groups, continue to live on this land practicing their culture and traditions to this day.

The Park District strives to promote accurate and holistic depictions of Indigenous peoples in our public and school programs. These programs are not a substitute for Native voices, and we ask others to join us in learning about California Native peoples from California Native peoples.

We extend our immense gratitude to the many Native peoples who have contributed – and continue to contribute – their perspectives, voices, history, and culture to our programs.

We understand supporting equity and inclusion for Indigenous people is ongoing and hope you will join us in this work as a part of our growing and diverse community. Let's celebrate the Indigenous people who continue to reside on this land and have been here since time immemorial.
