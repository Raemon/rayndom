## About the Facility

The Brazilian Room derives its name from its rich hardwood paneling (Jacaranda, Imbuya, Brazilian Chestnut and Mahogany) that was once part of the Brazilian Pavilion at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exhibition on Treasure Island in the San Francisco Bay that showcased the commerce and culture of the country of Brazil. When the exposition ended, the Brazil Building was presented to the newly-formed East Bay Regional Park District as a gift of friendship from the Brazilian government.

The exterior of the original building was perishable so the Works Progress Administration (WPA) built a new, English-style permanent exterior in Tilden Regional Park, one of the three inaugural regional parks, combining local rock and timber with the beautiful hardwood wall paneling from Brazil. The building was dedicated in 1941 and remodeled extensively in 1965. The Brazilian Room is currently a popular site for weddings, parties and business retreats.
