With 73 parks, 1,330 miles of trails and 55 miles of shoreline, the East Bay Regional Park District offers opportunities for hikers of all levels to explore and enjoy these invaluable natural resources.

## Trails Challenge

New to the Regional Parks? The free, self-guided, hiking and bicycling program, [Trails Challenge](/trails-challenge) is a great way to explore your Regional Parks.

Each year, the [Trails Challenge](/trails-challenge) includes **20** detailed trail descriptions available for all levels of fitness, from easy to challenging. There are trails open to hikers, bicyclists, dogs, and equestrians, and some trails are wheelchair accessible.

## Challenging Hikes

[Challenging Hikes](/recreation/hiking/challenging-hikes) are those that have significant elevation gain (1,000 feet or more), are 6 – 20 miles or more in length, trail conditions vary from good to rugged, and they generally take 4 – 8 hours to complete. These hikes are not for the faint-hearted!

## Short-Loop Trails

[Short-loop trails](/trails/short-loop) provide opportunities to enjoy the beauty of nature on a relatively non-strenuous walk on trails and pathways in the Regional Parks. These walks are suitable for senior citizens, persons in wheelchairs, parents with small children or with children in strollers, or for anyone not ready for the more demanding trails of wilderness parklands. Please read the full description of each walk before you go on the walk. While most are gentle, some trails may have rough or narrow sections or steeper climbs, and there are bicycle and dog restrictions in some of the parklands.

## Pole Walking & Pole Hiking Programs

Learning how to use poles helps walkers and hikers improve endurance, posture, balance, confidence, and strength as well as enhances your enjoyment of the outdoors. All class levels focus on anatomically-optimal techniques to achieve your desired performance while learning how to avoid joint stress or strain. The Outdoor Recreation Department offers poles classes taught by Jayah Faye Paley, an AFAA & ACE certified personal trainer and creator of comprehensive educational media on how to use poles, including two award winning DVDs.
