A beach wheelchair, intended to provide a means for wheelchair users to travel around the swimming lagoon, is available for free on a first-come, first-served basis. It requires an assistant to push and may enter the water. For information about the use of the beach wheelchair or pool lift, please contact the park office at [1-888-327-2757](tel:1-888-327-2757), option 3, ext. 4518.

## Attractions

### Picnicking

The park has reservable group picnic areas, view our [Contra Loma Picnic Areas](/recreation/picnics/contra-loma-picnic-areas-antioch) webpage for more information, and call Reservations to reserve.

### Swim Lagoon Public Swim

**Closed until further notice.**

### Boating

Visitors to Contra Loma may launch their own boats. For boat launch information and a schedule of fees, see our [Boating and Sailing](/recreation/boating) page. Please help keep Invasive Mussels out of our waters. Read more about the [Boat Inspections and the Invasive Mussel](https://ebparks.org/activities/boatingsailing/invasivemussels).  
The **fees for quagga inspection can be paid with a credit card at the Ventek machine** located at the kiosk.

**Note** : The Contra Costa Water District, which owns the reservoir, requires that all windsurfers and paddle boarders shower a minimum of 2 minutes prior to entering the reservoir and wear at least a short wetsuit. Showers are located outside the restrooms and next to the beach used by windsurfers. Persons using float tubes must wear waders or other wetsuit material to eliminate body contact with the water in the reservoir. People using sea kayaks that self-bail must shower prior to entering the reservoir and wear at least a short wetsuit. Other dry-type kayaks are permissible with the only restriction being no rollovers or other activities that cause body contact with the water.

### Fishing

The reservoir contains catfish, black and striped bass, bluegill, trout, and red-eared sunfish for fishing. A Daily [District Fishing Permit](/rentals-and-permits/permits/fishing-permit) is required and can be purchased at the park entry kiosk. Other information on fishing can be found in the [Fishing section](/recreation/fishing) of this site.

### Hiking
