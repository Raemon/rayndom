Keller Beach is at the north end of [Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline](/parks/miller-knox). There, visitors can wade and swim in San Francisco Bay. No lifeguards are on duty. Picnic tables and restrooms are nearby.

## Swim Beach Water Quality Program

Keller beach is tested for bacterial levels weekly from April to October and twice a month from November to March. The map below indicates the sample sites on the beach. The East Bay Regional Park District works with the Contra Costa County Environmental Health Department in accordance with California Department of Public Health's "Guidance for Salt Water Beaches" to determine water quality at Keller Beach. Our stop light sign is used to display the relative water quality from our latest bacteriological tests.

**Water Quality Stop Light Designations:**

**Please be advised there is always some level of risk when swimming in any water body.** To have a fun and safe experience swimming in the parks, we encourage you to follow a few simple rules:

  * Keep bay water out of your mouth
  * After you leave the water, shower and towel dry as soon as possible 
  * Do not swim in the bay for 3 days after a rainstorm
  * Check posted signs for water quality information
