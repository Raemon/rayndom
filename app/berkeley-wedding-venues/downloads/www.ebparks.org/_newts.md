#  Annual South Park Drive Closure for Newt Migration

South Park Drive in Tilden Regional Park will be closed to all motor vehicle traffic from November 1, 2025, through March 31, 2026, to protect migrating and breeding newts. During the closure, visitors are welcome to walk, cycle, or walk their dogs on the road. Please keep dogs away from newts, as the amphibians are poisonous to pets. Cyclists are asked to ride slowly and avoid newts crossing the road. As a reminder, collecting or disturbing wildlife is prohibited in all Regional Parks.

This seasonal closure helps provide a safe habitat for the small, slow-moving newts that call Tilden home. Watch for them on the ground when traveling by foot or bike on South Park Drive. Motorists are also urged to drive slowly when passing the Regional Parks Botanic Garden on Wildcat Canyon Road, where many newts cross in an unprotected area.

The Park District is committed to balancing public access with the protection of sensitive species in our urban wildlands. Although not officially listed as a threatened species, newt populations have declined over recent decades, primarily due to habitat loss. Since the mid-1980s, Tilden operations staff have worked closely with the Park District’s stewardship team to help ensure the safe migration of newts each year.

**Fun Facts about Newts**

There are two native newt species in our area — the California newt (_Taricha torosa_) and the rough-skinned newt (_Taricha granulosa_). The California newt is more common in the Regional Parks, especially in the eastern areas.

The California newt is a native amphibian measuring about five to six inches long. After spending the dry season in sheltered upland habitats, newts migrate to breeding sites in winter. They respond to moisture in the air, emerging after rainfall or even heavy fog.

Studies show that some newts can return to their home streams from distances of up to 2.5 miles, though shorter migrations are more common.

During the breeding season, male newts undergo more noticeable changes than females. Once in the water, males swell and become bulkier; their tails flatten for swimming, and they develop nuptial pads on their feet to help grip females. Females may show a slightly flattened tail but otherwise change little in appearance.

When newly hatched, larval newts resemble frog tadpoles but have tiny legs and external gills. Their front legs are visible from hatching and grow more prominent as they mature. Both local species have external gills as larvae, but only the California newt’s larvae are distinctly striped. As summer progresses, they metamorphose into terrestrial juveniles — miniature versions of the adults — changing color, losing their gills, and leaving the water for upland retreats.

Some newts spend the dry months in rodent burrows, under rocks and logs, or anywhere moisture lingers, while others may remain in breeding pools year-round if water levels persist.

Visit the Park District’s [Amphibians ](https://www.ebparks.org/programs/digital-learning/naturalist-videos/plants-animals/amphibians)webpage to learn more about newts — including where to find them, their regeneration abilities, conservation efforts, and remarkable abilities.
