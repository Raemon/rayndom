Storm Damaged Trail Closures

**Garin Woods Trail, Ziele Creek Trail, and South Fork Trail** are currently closed due to storm damage. Other trails have also sustained some storm damage. Use caution while accessing all open trails in Garin and Dry Creek Pioneer. [View Map](/sites/default/files/garin_dry_creek_map.pdf). Updated January 23, 2026.

## 

Dry Creek Garden Closures

Due to storm damage **Dry Creek Garden** is closed until further notice. Updated January 23, 2026.

Garin/Dry Creek Pioneer Regional Parks are two adjoining parks from former 19th Century ranches. The Park District has preserved the history of the parks and expanded both over the years with ecologically and historically significant ridges, trails, and open spaces. The combined parks now encompass over 5,800 acres of open space and more than 35 miles of trails through narrow valleys and rolling hills with panoramic views of the Bay Area.

_"This is Dry Creek and we bid you welcome._

_Famed in the early 1880s for the spirit of gaiety that reigned here on festival days, guests poured in from the rural districts of the whole county to greet their friends and make merry._

_And so today, we pray you to maintain with us that holiday spirit; leave care and worry behind you; enjoy the beauties of nature here in your midst; and pause for a moment in your rush through life to give thanks to the great artist who painted this ever-changing picture of the hills and fields and streams."_

\--Edith Meyers, of the Meyers Ranch Family

## Park Accessibility

Wheelchair-accessible restrooms are located in the restroom building by the Garin Barn. A wheelchair-accessible chemical toilet is located near Jordan Pond. Accessible drinking fountains are located throughout the picnic area. The service roads around the meadows and picnic areas at Garin are wheelchair accessible and total between 0.25 and 0.5 miles in length. Disabled-accessible parking is available at the Garin parking lot at the end of Garin Avenue in Hayward, and at the Dry Creek Garden parking lot at the end of May Road in Union City.

## Attractions

### Garin Red Barn Visitor Center

It is designed to aide in interpretive programs and for the enjoyment of the casual visitor. The Visitor Center displays artifacts from the ranching and farming history of the Hayward area. There is a blacksmith shop, a tool shop and several ranching-related displays to explore. An interesting collection of antique farm machinery outside the barn augments the display.

### Dry Creek Garden

Meyers Cottage was a popular summer home of Edith, Mildred, and Jeanette Meyers, three sisters of Alameda who were very involved in local charities and fundraisers during the early and mid 1900s. The sisters also owned the 1,626-acre Dry Creek Ranch, which was donated to the Park District in 1979 and later opened as Dry Creek Regional Park. Upon the passing of the last surviving Meyers sister, the Meyers Cottage and its garden was also donated to the Park District.

The beautifully restored two-acre garden is home to nearly 200 native and exotic plants, with something in bloom just about every day of the year. In addition to the restoration of the garden, pathways were rebuilt and footbridges were reconstructed over the creek. The garden is open to the public Thursdays through Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The garden and cottage is located at the end of May Road off Mission Boulevard in Union City, and the parking lot is open all week until dusk (see Park/Gate hours at right), providing access to trails at the south end of Dry Creek Regional Park, which is adjacent to Garin Regional Park.

A newer feature of Dry Creek Garden is the Iris Garden, which is usually open for two months during the spring, Thursdays through Sundays from 10am to 4pm.

### Nature Study

Look around you and you will find two magnificent parkland areas--Garin and Dry Creek Pioneer regional parks. Independent nature study is encouraged here, so bring binoculars, a magnifying glass, field guides, and camera, and be amazed at what you will discover. Guided interpretive programs for this area are coordinated through the Coyote Hills Regional Park Visitor Center in Fremont. For information, phone 1-510-544-3220.

### Garin Apple Festival

The spirit of Garin's orchards live on in the antique apple varieties cultivated in remnants of the old apple orchards. The late-summer Garin Apple Festival celebrates the farm's apple-growing tradition. Antique apple varieties grown in the orchards may be tasted in the flesh and as juice. Folk music, song, and old-fashioned games fill out the day. The Garin Apple Festival Event will be held on **Sunday, Sept 7, 2025**.

### School Groups

Teachers or group leaders wishing to use the park with a naturalist guide, or those looking for curriculum guides for using the parklands, should contact the Coyote Hills Regional Park Visitor Center at 1-510-544-3220.

### Picnicking

Several picnicking areas near the Garin Avenue park entrance are available for use by families and larger groups. Hikers can carry picnic lunches in day packs and enjoy lunch along one of the many park trails.

There are four large group picnic areas at Garin: The Cattlemen's, Buttonwood, and Ranchside areas each accommodating 50 people, and Pioneer serves 50. 

Picnic reservations must be made by calling 3 or more business days in advance. Visit the [Garin/Dry Creek Picnic Areas](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/picnics/garin-dry-creek-picnic-areas) page for more information, or call Reservations to reserve.

### Camping

Arroyo Flats group campsite has five 10' tables, one double BBQ, a drinking fountain, one fire circle with benches, and two chemical toilets. This site can accommodate groups of 25 people or more, up to 75. Reservations are required and must be made 3 or more business days in advance. View the [Camping page](/recreation/camping) for more information, and call Reservations to reserve.

### Hiking and Horseback Riding

The more than 20 miles of trails within Garin and Dry Creek Pioneer Regional Parks give you the opportunity to explore the 5,857 acres that comprise these parklands. While the trails are not paved, many are suitable for bicycles. Motorcycles and all other types of motor vehicles are not allowed on the trails.

### Kite Flying

All kite flying is restricted to the kite field at Garin.  
No remote-controlled aircraft, vehicles or boats allowed.

### Trail Etiquette

Carry out what you carry in. No littering allowed. No alcohol in the backcountry. Any type of gun–-air rifle or greater--and paintball guns are NOT allowed.

Equestrians have the right of way on trails; hikers and bicyclists should yield to people on horseback (bicyclists should dismount). Heel or leash your dogs. Bicyclists should call out when passing hikers and remember that not everyone on the trail can hear you, especially if they are wearing headphones or earbuds. Try not to take up the whole trail when riding in groups. Hikers should walk or stand to the right so bicyclists can pass safety; try not to take up the whole trail when hiking.

Equestrians are not to bring their horses into the picnic sites at Garin. Stay to the south edge of the meadow area instead. No trick riding or demonstrations please, as children and others may be injured.

No gathering of natural materials is allowed, plant material (dead or alive); wildlife of any kind, be it insect, mammal, reptile, or bird; rocks or cultural artifacts.

### Dog Walking

Dogs must be on a leash (six-foot maximum) in all parking lots, picnic areas, lawns, and playfields. Dogs must be under voice control at all times, and please have a leash in-hand and ready for use when necessary.

Please keep your dog(s) under control to prevent conflicts with cattle and confrontations with coyotes. Do not allow your dog(s) to chase the cattle, it may result in injuries and death to cattle. If you see cattle ahead, please heel or leash your dog(s) until you are past the cattle.

### Fishing

The Jordan Pond pier was constructed in 1987 by Park District crews using materials provided through the generosity of the Hayward, South Hayward, and Mt. Eden Lions Clubs. Jordan Pond has naturally reproducing populations of large-mouth bass, bluegill, and sunfish. Anglers aged 16 or older must have a [state fishing license](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Licensing/Fishing).
