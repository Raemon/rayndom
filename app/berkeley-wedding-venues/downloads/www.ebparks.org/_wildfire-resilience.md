## Key Advocacy Goal

To minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire in the East Bay by using proactive vegetation management which is ecologically sound.

  * Support the development and retention of well-trained, dedicated and productive employees
  * Participate in partnerships with public agencies, nonprofit organizations, volunteers and the private sector to achieve mutual goals



## Survey Identified Voter/Community Support

  * In a November 2021 survey, 99% of respondents believed managing flammable vegetation to reduce wildfire risk to be extremely/very/somewhat important.
  * In this same survey, 95% identified improved wildfire and public safety response by increasing firefighters, equipment and updated communications systems to be extremely/very/somewhat important.
  * In a May 2021 survey, 86% of respondents found protecting against catastrophic wildfires to be extremely/very important.
  * On - going drought conditions, dry and dying vegetation, and increased tree mortality across the East Bay require additional resources to manage fire resilient, safe, healthy forests. We need to increase funding for fire protection equipment and additional firefighters to protect our community from catastrophic wildfire.” In a November 2021 survey, **83% of respondents** found this argument for increased wildfire funding investments convincing.
