#  Permit Requirement Discontinued for the Ohlone Wilderness Trail

November 19, 2025

The East Bay Regional Park District has discontinued the requirement for an Ohlone Wilderness Trail day-use permit, improving ease of access and recognizing hiking and walking trails as core Park District resources. Permit sales will end immediately, and trail users may access the Ohlone Wilderness Trail without a permit. Refunds will not be issued for 2025 permits already purchased.  
  
Although a permit is no longer required for day hiking, **overnight camping reservations and associated fees remain in effect.**  
  
The Ohlone Wilderness Trail was the only day-use trail in the Regional Parks system that required an access fee. The hardcopy permit, which also served as a trail map, cost $2 on-site or $4 by mail, though it was never a positive revenue stream due to processing fees and postage.   
  
Trail maps will continue to be available by mail for $4 from the Reservations Department only through December 2025. Trail users may pick up a map at no charge at any of the following locations. Visit the [Visitor Center webpage](/parks/visitor-centers) for operating hours.  
• Sunol Wilderness Regional Preserve Visitor Center, Sunol   
• Del Valle Regional Park Visitor Center, Livermore  
• Coyote Hills Regional Park Visitor Center, Fremont   
• EBRPD Headquarters, 2950 Peralta Oaks Court, Oakland (Monday–Friday, 8:30 a.m.–5 p.m.)

**Safety Tips**  
Because of the trail’s remote location, it is especially important to take safety precautions.  
• Carry a paper map. There is no cell phone reception along much of the route.  
• Inform someone of your planned route and expected return time.  
• Pack plenty of drinking water and snacks.  
• Water stations noted on the website provide non-potable water that must be boiled or filtered before safe consumption.  
• Expect long stretches of trail in full sun.  
• Local wildlife includes species such as bobcats, mountain lions, and rattlesnakes.  
  
For information on camping reservations, trail conditions, or wilderness safety, visit the [Ohlone Wilderness Regional Preserve webpage](/parks/ohlone).

**About the Ohlone Wilderness Trail**  
The Ohlone Wilderness Trail connects several of the East Bay’s most scenic Regional Parks—Mission Peak in Fremont, the Sunol Wilderness, and Del Valle in Livermore—offering more than 28 miles of rugged terrain, panoramic vistas, and backcountry experiences close to home. The trail is accessible only by hiking or horseback riding.  
  
Elevation changes are significant: hikers begin at a few hundred feet above sea level and climb to ridgelines approaching 3,800 feet, including Rose Peak at 3,817 feet. Over the full route, cumulative elevation gain reaches several thousand feet.  
  
Dogs are permitted on the trail during daytime use only. **Dogs are not allowed on overnight backpacking trips.**
