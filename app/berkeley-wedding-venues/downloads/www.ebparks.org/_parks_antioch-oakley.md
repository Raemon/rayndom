A 550-foot pier provides access to great fishing in the San Joaquin River at Antioch/Oakley Regional Shoreline, located just upstream from Highway 160's Nejedly Bridge in Antioch. Swimming is not allowed at the shoreline park, but fishing, picnicking and kite flying are all favorite pastimes. The park is open from 5:00am to 10 p.m. Overnight use of the park, including camping and picnicking, is not allowed. Fishing from the pier, however, is allowed 24 hours daily.

There is no parking fee or admission fee. Picnic tables are first-come, first-served and cannot be reserved.

### Fishing

The fishing pier is open 24 hours daily, year-round. Depending on the season, fish that can be caught from the pier include striped bass, channel catfish, Sacramento pike, sturgeon, steelhead and salmon. A fishing license is required for all anglers aged 16 or older. Please follow these fishing rules:

  * Know and follow all State Fish and Game regulations while fishing from the pier or shoreline.
  * A State fishing license is required for persons aged 16 or older. (A Park District Daily Fishing Access Permit is not required at Antioch/Oakley Regional Shoreline, but is required for persons aged 16 or older at Lake Chabot, Contra Loma, Cull Canyon, Del Valle, Shadow Cliffs, Don Castro, and Lake Temescal. Fishing Access Permits are available at most of these facilities. The disabled or those aged 62 or older may purchase an annual Fishing Access Permit. Permit revenues help to purchase fish plants for District fishing lakes.)

## History

Antioch/Oakley Shoreline is operated by the East Bay Regional Park District on a no-cost lease from the State of California. The land was acquired in 1979 with the support of then-Senator John Nejedly, who later served as a State Parks commissioner. When the state constructed the new bridge, now named for Nejedly, that now passes over the park's western edge, Nejedly suggested that some of the old bridge's pillars be used for a fishing pier. This was done, and the new pier has been a great success. The pier is open around the clock for fishing, every day of the year.

The park was renamed from Antioch Regional Shoreline to Antioch/Oakley Regional Shoreline in 1999 to commemorate the incorporation of Oakley in that year.
