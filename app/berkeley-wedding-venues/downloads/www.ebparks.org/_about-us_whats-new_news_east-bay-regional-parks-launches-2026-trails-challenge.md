#  East Bay Regional Parks Launches 2026 Trails Challenge

### 

Popular program in the great outdoors returns Jan. 1

December 31, 2025

The East Bay Regional Park District is launching the 2026 Trails Challenge — the program’s 33rd annual edition — inviting the public to explore trails that show off the region’s stunning natural beauty. Individuals interested in the program can pick up a free guidebook and T-shirt at any East Bay Regional Parks visitor center, while supplies last. The guidebook can also be downloaded on the [Trails Challenge webpage](/trailschallenge). A Spanish edition will be available online and in visitor centers in mid-January.  
  
“The East Bay Regional Parks Trails Challenge is a great way to explore Regional Parks — not only a person’s regular favorites, but also planning adventures to parks farther out,” said Mike Moran, Interpretive and Recreation Services Manager. “The Park District's 73 parks are spread throughout Alameda and Contra Costa counties, offering quite a range of landscapes to enjoy. Visitors can be on the beach today observing shorebirds, then tomorrow head into the redwood groves found in the Berkeley and Oakland hills or tackle a long stretch of the oak-covered Pleasanton Ridge.”   
  
The Trails Challenge presents a selection of 20 trails hand-picked by staff to offer a range of experiences for a variety of skill and endurance levels. To complete the challenge, participants finish any five of the featured trails, or log 26.2 cumulative miles on any trails in the Regional Parks system. The deadline is Dec. 31, 2026. Finishers submit a trail log online or by mail to receive a commemorative pin, while supplies last.  
  
The Trails Challenge was launched in 1993 in partnership with the Regional Parks Foundation and Kaiser Permanente as a way to promote health by spending time outdoors. These two primary sponsors have returned for 2026, along with AllTrails, which provides complimentary 3-month Plus-level memberships on its popular hiking smartphone app via a QR code in the Trails Challenge guidebook.  
  
**Special Giveaways**  
Finishers who submit their logs online also qualify for monthly prize drawings and other giveaways while supplies last.

• Giveaways from in-kind sponsor AllTrails  
• A commemorative 2026 Trails Challenge bandana   
• Embroidered patches celebrating finishers in special categories  
▫ Pathfinder (kids up to age 9)  
▫ Junior Trailblazer (tweens ages 10-12)  
▫ Trailblazer (teens ages 13-18)  
▫ Timeless Trekker (ages 65 and up)  
▫ All 20 Club (for those who complete all 20 trails featured in the book)  
  
**#TrailsChallengeEBRPD**  
There will also be drawings for those who post selfies on social media and tag #TrailsChallengeEBRPD. 

For more information, visit the [2026 Trails Challenge webpage](/trailschallenge).
