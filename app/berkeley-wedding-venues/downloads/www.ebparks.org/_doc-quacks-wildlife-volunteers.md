## Wildlife Volunteers Mission Statement

The Wildlife Volunteers are a group of caring people of all ages striving to improve the quality of life for birds and wildlife in the East Bay Regional Park District. We are dedicated to assisting the East Bay Regional Park District’s Stewardship staff with protecting, managing, conserving and enhancing the region’s important scenic and natural resources. Wildlife Volunteers renew their connections to the land through sciences-based, hands-on conservation and resource management activities.

### **Least Tern Colony Monitors**

Here is your opportunity to become a “Birding-Peeping-Tom” by peering into the family life of terns. You will be helping to record data about their nest distribution, chronology and reproductive success using the Type 2 monitoring method. In this method, surveys are conducted from a vehicle approximately 25m (75ft.) from the island at various times of day, with the majority of the surveys conducted from 0700 to 1700 hours, seven days a week. A Cabela’s professional 60mm (2.4 in) spotting scope on a car window mount will be available. By participating, you’ll earn your “Colony Caretakers” patch. Physical labor is involved with this project. Parent participation required.  
**No scheduled events,** check back soon.
