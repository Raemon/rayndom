## **Picnic Reservations**

The Park District has over 3,806 picnic tables throughout its 73 parks. There are also 139 reservable group sites for groups of 35 to 500 people.

  * **Picnic reservations are open through December 2026.** Picnic site reservations cannot be made online. Reservations may be made by calling 1-888-EBPARKS ([1-888-327-2757](tel:1-888-327-2757)), press option 2. For persons with hearing impairments, please use the Telecommunications Relay Service at 711. Telephone hours are Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. - 4 p.m. [Check Availability](https://apm.activecommunities.com/ebparks/Facility_Search).

  * Picnic sites inside swim areas at Cull Canyon, Don Castro, and Quarry Lakes are not available for reservation.
  * Bounce houses, dunk tanks, combative play equipment, or other inflatables are not permitted.

In-District (Alameda and Contra Costa counties) organizations and agency groups hosting events solely for people with disabilities, seniors, and/or low-income groups that cannot afford the fees may qualify for a fee waiver. [Fee Waiver Procedures (PDF)](/sites/default/files/Fee-Waiver-Procedures.pdf?v=2).

## Picnic FAQs

### 

How do I make a picnic reservation?

**Picnic site reservations cannot be made online**. Reservations may be made by calling 1-888-EBPARKS ([1-888-327-2757](tel:1-888-327-2757)), press option 2. For persons with hearing impairments, please use the Telecommunications Relay Service at 711. Telephone hours are Monday through Friday, 9am-4pm.

**Unreserved Picnic Tables.__** Picnic tables that are  _not reserved_ are available on a first come, first served basis. Picnic tables that are  _not reserved_ , require that at least one person be present at each table. We recommend groups of  _30 or less_ people arrive on a first-come, first-serve basis.

### 

Which sites can I reserve?

You can [check the availability of reservable picnic sites on online](http://apm.activecommunities.com/ebparks/ "EBParks.org/Register"), but you cannot make picnic site reservations online. We do not make reservations for Memorial Day, July 4th and Labor Day; picnic sites become first-come, first-served on those days.

### 

How many sites can I reserve?

Each event is limited to one reservable site, even if reservations are made under different names or accounts. All event activities must remain within the reserved site and comply with the site’s maximum capacity.

For purposes of this policy, an event is any gathering or celebration, including but not limited to birthdays, anniversaries, family reunions, graduations, receptions, and baby showers.

**Wedding ceremony exception**  
The only exception to the one-site-per-event policy is for wedding ceremonies at Roberts Regional Recreation Area, limited to the following paired sites: Bay Vista–Madrone; Roberts Grove–Huckleberry

A wedding ceremony is defined by what occurs on site, not by how the event is described. Any gathering that includes a ceremony to formalize or celebrate a marriage or commitment between two persons and includes an officiant and an exchange of vows in a structured ceremony is considered a wedding ceremony for reservation purposes. For approved wedding ceremonies at Roberts, the ceremony may occur only within the designated open space associated with the paired sites listed above.

### 

How much does it cost to make a picnic reservation?

Fees are based on the capacity of the picnic site. The size of your group may not exceed the maximum capacity for the picnic site. However, no fee reductions are made if your group size is less than the capacity, for example, if you have 150 people in a 300-person site, the fee is still $470 for residents or $658 for non-residents.

Site capacities for each reservable site [can be found online](https://apm.activecommunities.com/ebparks/Facility_Search "Facility Search") by searching for picnic sites under the "facilities" tab. Photos and site descriptions are also available of most reservable areas. 

Site fees are also based on whether the person reserving a picnic site is a Resident or a Non-Resident of our District (Alameda & Contra Costa County). [CITIES IN ALAMEDA COUNTY](http://www.acgov.org/about/cities.htm "Cities of Alameda County") | [CITIES IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY](http://www.co.contra-costa.ca.us/index.aspx?NID=1243 "Cities of Contra Costa")

### 

What are the picnic check-in times?

**10:00 a.m.**

Picnic reservations are for the full day; we do not book multiple reservations per day. If you have a picnic reservation you are required to be at the site by this time, or it becomes a first-come, first served after 10:30 a.m., even though you have paid for the reservaiton. 

On holiday weekends we suggest you arrive at your reserved site 30 minutes prior to the check-in time.

### 

What if I don't want to make a reservation? Are there first-come, first-served areas?

Throughout our parks we have many picnic areas and tables that are available on a first-come, first-served basis. First-come, first-served picnic sites usually have one or two tables with a BBQ and generally do not have a site name. At least one person per table must be present in order to hold it. Our reservable picnic sites have a wooden post with site names posted on them (example: Big Rock, Parkview, Mallard). Most of the reservable sites are clusters of tables and BBQs. Reservable sites will have a flyer showing who has reserved the site for the day. If this site has not been reserved, it may be used on a first-come, first-served basis.

### 

When can I make a picnic reservation?

Reservations for picnic sites must be made at least 3 days in advance. Reservations for Saturday or Sunday must be made by 4pm on the previous Wednesday.

### 

What is the policy for Security Deposits?

A security deposit is charged on all reservable picnic sites. All or some of your security and damage deposit may be retained for violation of any of the terms of the contract. This deposit is fully refundable if the area is left in good condition and regular servicing will make it ready for the next group to use. For example, all party decorations including piñata and balloons must be thoroughly cleaned-up. Park staff will document any issue requiring that any or all of the deposit be retained. Please note that if excessive staff intervention is required, you will be billed. If your security deposit is retained for any reason, you will be notified by email or US Mail. Otherwise, security deposits paid by credit card will be refunded within 2-3 weeks after your picnic; checks take 4-6 weeks.

### 

How do I pay for my reservation?

Full payment is due at the time of booking. We accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express. Charges are processed immediately and will appear on your statement as “** _ACT EAST BAY REG. PARKS- Oakland_**.” Cash is only accepted in person at the Reservations Office. **NOTE:** ** _The cancellation and change policy will immediately be in effect (read about the cancel/change policy in the next section) once you make payment._**

### 

How do I CANCEL or CHANGE my picnic reservation?

Please view the site before making the reservation. There are no refunds if the picnic site does not meet your expectations. To cancel or change your reservation, you must call the Reservations Department at [1-888-327-2757](tel:1-888-327-2757), option 2 (9am – 4pm PST, M-F).  
  
**CANCELLATION:**

  * 14 or more days in advance, 90% of the site use fees + 100% of the security deposit is refundable
  * 13 - 3 days in advance, 50% of the site use fees + 100% of the security deposit is refundable
  * Under 3 days, 100% of the security deposit is refundable. NO site use fees are refundable.



**CHANGES:**

  * NO changes to the reservation will be made under 3 days.
  * 3 or more days in advance, an $8 reservation service fee will be assessed for changing dates and/or changing sites. You will be responsible for paying for any difference in site cost + the $8 reservation service fee. If new site cost is less than the original site cost, you will be refunded the difference less the $8 reservation service fee. Each change to a reservation will incur an additional $8 reservation service fee. 



*The $8 reservation service fee paid upon initial reservation as well as any incurred from changes to a reservation are non-refundable.

### 

What if it rains?

Only issued for steady rain during the reservation window, 10am-6pm. Request for a refund must be received the same day via an email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5a283f293f282c3b2e333534291a3f382a3b2831297435283d). Include your reservation # and any additional information. No refunds for other inclement weather conditions, insects, fire or water restrictions, or similar uncontrollable factors.

### 

What are the restrictions for using the BBQs at the picnic site?
