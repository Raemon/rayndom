![Parkn It Day Camp Logo](/sites/default/files/styles/original_800w_/public/park_n_it_day_camp_logo.jpg?itok=EoA67NUF)

**Park’n It Day Camp** is a traditional Summer day camp program that takes place Monday to Friday from 9am to 4pm in various East Bay Regional Parks. Camps feature hands-on experiences under the care of our highly-trained staff of recreation leaders, lifeguards, and naturalists. 

Your child will learn about our park ecology, play games, make art projects, go fishing, hike, and swim, and enjoy field trips to other parks.

**Park’n It Day Camp** is part of the Healthy Parks Healthy People initiative. We believe when kids engage in active outdoor recreation in parks, they grow into healthy and eco-literate adults who care about parks and the environment. For more info visit [EBParks.org/HPHP](/programs/hphp).
