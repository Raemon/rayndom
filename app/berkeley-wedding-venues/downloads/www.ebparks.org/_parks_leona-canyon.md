Storm-damaged Trail

A culvert on **Leona Trail near Artemisia Trail** has failed and is impassible. The trail is not closed as the park can still be accessed from both sides, but the trail no longer connects and the area should be avoided for further landslide issues. [View Map](/sites/default/files/Leona-Canyon-Map.pdf).

A pristine wooded canyon is protected in this 290-acre parkland near Merritt College in Oakland. Restoration is in progress along Rifle Range Creek along Leona Trail to reduce erosion and protect the riparian ecosystem. Dogs and humans are not allowed in the creek. Please keep dogs on a leash if they will not stay out of the stream.

In May 2022, the US Army Corps of Engineers and Army National Guard conducted a [Remedial Action (RA)](/sites/default/files/Leona-Heights-Remedial-Action-Fact-Sheet-July-2022.pdf) at this park and the work was successfully and safely completed in early June 2022.
