South Park Drive Annual Closure for Newt Migration

**South Park Drive** in Tilden Park will be closed to vehicles from **November 1, 2025** through **March 31, 2026** for the protection of California newts as they utilize the road to migrate during the rainy season. Please adjust your travel plans by using other access routes such as **Shasta Road** or **Golf Course Drive**. **South Park Drive** will remain open to pedestrians and bicyclists. [More Info](/newts).

View [Tilden Attractions (PDF)](/sites/default/files/Tilden-Attractions.pdf?v=Winter26-2) for a list of current hours and contact details.

In 2020, the North American Rock Garden Society ([NARGS](https://www.nargs.org/)) awarded the Frank Cabot Public Rock Garden Award to the Regional Parks Botanic Garden in recognition of the outstanding rock garden and plantings.

The Regional Parks Botanic Garden was founded on January 1, 1940. Situated in Tilden Regional Park's beautiful Wildcat Canyon in the heart of the north Berkeley Hills, the garden is devoted to the collection, growth, display, and preservation of the native plants of California. The state is a vast region of many floral areas, such as seacoast bluffs and coastal mountains, interior valleys, arid foothills, alpine zones, and two kinds of desert. California embraces nearly 160,000 square miles - imagine 160,000 square miles of California set in a garden that can be walked in a day.

The public is welcome in this garden, see opening hours above. All specimens are landscaped into a delightful setting, offering many enjoyable days of exploration, relaxation, and contemplation. To the student, the Botanic Garden offers the premier Northern California venue in which to study the state's native plants without wandering far from home or dorm. Indoors, in the Visitor Center, lectures and slide shows are scheduled on most Saturdays from November through February, and an exhibit pertaining to the native flora is usually to be found in the auditorium.

Notable among the many specimens that have been brought in from all corners of the state are representatives of nearly all the state's conifers and oaks, and probably the most complete collections of California manzanitas to be found anywhere. There are also extensive collections of California native bunchgrasses, bulbs, aquatic plants, and representatives of about 300 taxa that are classified in the California Native Plant Society's landmark study, "Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular Plants of California."

**Notice: Dogs are not allowed.**

## Attractions

### The State in 10 Geographically Based Sections

For the sake of clarity of display, the majority of the garden is divided into ten geographically-based sections. The sections are: Southern California (plants designated by sand-colored labels), Shasta-Klamath (green labels), Valley-Foothill (yellow labels), Santa Lucia (orange labels), Channel Islands (black labels), Sierran (blue labels), Redwood (red labels), Sea Bluff (brown labels), Pacific Rain Forest (green labels), and Franciscan (yellow labels). The Canyon (brown labels) section, at the northernmost part of the garden, is not geographically based. Here, the plants are grouped according to their individual horticultural requirements.

There are also three subsections: aquatic plants, coastal dune plants, and the Antioch Dunes of Contra Costa County.
