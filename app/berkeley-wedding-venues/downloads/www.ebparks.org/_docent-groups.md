# Docent Groups

#### Something truly special happens when you share yourself with others...

![Volunteer Docent with rabbit and two smiling children](/sites/default/files/styles/original_800w_/public/100_2765.jpg?itok=rH197TyT)

For over 30 years, the East Bay Regional Park District has provided opportunities for members of the public to do just that--share their love of nature or their passion for history by becoming docents.

Remember the first time you positively identified a red-tailed hawk? Or how excited you were when you first saw a butterfly chrysalis? These are life-changing moments for many of us. If you become a docent, you could be the one to share these moments with other park visitors!

![Docent at Ardenwood Farm demonstrating spinning yarn to a group of children](/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_400w/public/Docent_AW_Zarzycki-20121013_011.jpg?h=c74750f6&itok=3wo2uGPl)

If you have a passion for learning and sharing, a love for nature or history, and would like to share your passion with like-minded people who share your enthusiasm for encouraging stewardship in the parks, then you will find a visitor center that can help you become an East Bay Regional Park District docent. New docent training programs will be offered this year at most of the visitor centers, so call a Visitor Center today and find out how you can get involved.

### Docent Training Programs

After completing training classes, docents work alongside naturalists to provide hands-on learning opportunities to students and assist with special events. Minimum requirements are that docents must attend the training sessions and agree to volunteer a minimum number of hours per month, which varies by interpretive center. A $35 fee covers classroom instruction and supplies.
