[Fire Danger Rating Areas (FDRA)](https://www.ebparks.org/public-safety/fire/fire-danger-and-weather-information) | [Remote Automated Weather Stations (RAWS)](https://www.ebparks.org/public-safety/fire/weather-station-raws)

![Fire danger sign with smokey the bear](/sites/default/files/styles/original_800w_/public/Fire_Sign_3_Smokey_the_Bear.jpg?itok=If_2PL-r)

The Regional Parks are divided into four [Fire Danger Rating Areas (FDRA)](/public-safety/fire/fire-danger-and-weather-information). The District monitors several Remote Automatic Weather Stations ([RAWS)](/public-safety/fire/weather-station-raws) that provide fire weather information that is translated into notifications about potential fire danger and threats to public safety in the FDRA .   
  
Many parks have Fire Danger notification signs posted near their entrances (see photo on left). From May through October, it is common to see Fire Danger signs of "Extreme," "Very High," or "High" with restrictions for park visitors, contractors, and staff. When ratings are “Low" or “Moderate” there may be no restrictions. However, the following must be observed at all times:

  * No smoking. Smoking is prohibited in all regional trails, parks, and shoreline.
  * No building, lighting, or maintaining fires of any kind in areas where prohibited. Follow all posted fire notifications.



Follow all restrictions under each Fire Danger Level to protect parklands from human-caused wildfires.

## Fire Danger Levels

### 

Extreme Fire Danger, Level 2 Restrictions

#### General Operating Procedures during periods of Level 2 Restrictions include:

**Parks will remain open with the following restrictions in effect:**

  * No open fires or barbeques of any type. Gas-fueled stoves/barbecues are permitted in all areas.
  * Vehicles are restricted to driving only on designated roadways; no cross-country driving.
  * No use of gasoline powered equipment (e.g. mowers in rough areas, weed eaters, chainsaws, welders and generators) outside of irrigated areas, designated campgrounds or developed recreational areas. Maintenance of irrigated areas is permitted. Road grading is permitted provided extra protection fire safety measures approved by the Fire Chief are implemented.
  * Contractors may continue working on District lands provided they institute extra protection fire safety measures approved by the Fire Chief. Contractor operations must be directly supervised by a District representative to ensure specified extra protection fire safety measures are implemented.
  * Increase monitoring and patrol by Park Staff.
    * Keep fire danger adjective signs current.
    * Post appropriate fire hazard warning signs.
    * Prepare and check all fire equipment for readiness.
    * Notify all groups, special event participants, day-use visitors, campers, permittees, contractors and park employees of restrictions.

### 

Very High Fire Danger, Level 1 Restrictions

#### Fire Behavior

Fires start easily from all causes and immediately after ignition, spread rapidly and increase quickly in intensity. Spot fires are a constant danger. Fires burning in light fuels may quickly develop high intensity characteristics such as long distance spotting and fire whirlwinds when they burn in heavier fuels. Both suppression and mop‐up will require an extended and very thorough effort. Outdoor burning is not recommended. Fire restrictions may be in effect at this level.

**Parks will remain open with the following restrictions in effect:**  
**Park Visitors**

  * No campfires outside of designated day-use picnic areas, campgrounds or developed recreational areas. Barbeques permitted only in designated day-use picnic areas, campgrounds or developed recreational areas.
    * Ensure all burning fuel such as wood or charcoal is thoroughly extinguished before disposing it in an existing fireplace, fire pit, or barbecue grill. It is illegal to dispose coals in garbage cans or refuse bins. **[How to: Properly extinguish campfires](https://www.ebparks.org/sites/default/files/FireSafety_Campfire_Rules_Card.pdf).**
  * Gas-fueled stoves/barbecues permitted in designated areas.
    * Place in an area that will not scorch, burn, or damage lawns or picnic table tops.
    * Place in an area at least 30 feet from any flammable material such as grass, weeds, wood chips, brush, or buildings.
  * No off-road driving. Drive only on designated roadways. No driving or parking on dry grass; heat from vehicle's undercarriage can start a fire.
  * Secure all tow chains; a dragging chain throws sparks that can start fires.



#### Contractors and Park Staff

  * See restrictions above under Park Visitors.
  * No usage of gasoline powered equipment (e.g. mowers in rough areas, weed eaters, chainsaws, welders, and generators) outside of irrigated areas, designated campgrounds or developed recreational areas unless extra protection fire safety measures approved by the Fire Chief are implemented.
  * Maintenance of irrigated areas and road grading is permitted.



#### Park Staff

  * Increase monitoring and patrol
  * Keep fire danger adjective signs current
  * Post appropriate fire hazard warning signs
  * Prepare and check all fire equipment for readiness
  * Notify all groups, special event participants, day-use visitors, campers, permittees, contractors, and park staff of restrictions.



### 

High Fire Danger

All fine and dead fuels ignite readily and fires start easily from most causes. Unattended brush and camp fires are likely to escape. Fires spread rapidly and short‐distance spotting is common. Fires may become serious and their control difficult unless they are attacked successfully while small.

  * No off-road driving. Drive only on designated roadways. No driving or parking on dry grass; heat from vehicle's undercarriage can start a fire.
  * Secure all tow chains; a dragging chain throws sparks that can start fires.



**Parks will remain open with the following restriction in effect:  
Contractors and Park Staff**  
Outdoor burning should be restricted to early morning and late evening hours.

### 

Moderate Fire Danger

Fires can start from most accidental causes, but with the exception of lightning fires in some areas, the number of starts is generally low. Expect moderate flame length and rate of spread. Short‐distance spotting may occur, but is not persistent. Fires are not likely to become serious and control is relatively easy. Although controlled burning can be done without creating a hazard, **routine caution** should be taken.

### 

Low Fire Danger

Fuels do not ignite readily from small firebrands although a more intense heat source, such as lightning, may start fires in duff or punky (insect killed) wood.  
Weather and fuel conditions will lead to slow fire spread, low intensity, and relatively easy control with light mop‐up. There is little danger of spotting.  
Controlled burns can usually be executed with reasonable safety.

## Fire Weather Alerts

### Red Flag Warning

Image

![Red flag warning](/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_400w/public/Red_Flag_Warning.png?h=a9e0b0f2&itok=bWLilIIG)

A Red Flag Warning is a short term, temporary warning indicating the presence of dangerous combinations of temperature, wind, relative humidity, fuel, or drought conditions which can contribute to new fires or rapid spread of existing fires.  
A Red Flag Warning is declared when there is a likelihood of hot, dry winds, or a prediction of severe lightning storms.  
A Red Flag Warning can be issued at any of the above Fire Danger Levels.

### Fire Weather Watch

Image

![Fire weather watch](/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_400w/public/Fire_Weather_Watch.jpg?h=a9e0b0f2&itok=XX1q3hfu)

A Fire Weather Watch will normally be issued 12 to 24 hours in advance of the expected onset of severe fire weather conditions. The Fire Danger rating is usually in the "High to Extreme" levels.

### **Park Closures**

[Park closures](https://www.ebparks.org/alerts-closures) will only occur in the parks when both the fire department has limited resources to fight fire and the National Weather Service declares a Red Flag Warning.

Before visiting a park, remember to check the [Alerts and Closures](https://www.ebparks.org/alerts-closures) page for the most current updates. If the Fire Danger sign or other public notices declare the Fire Danger Level is "Extreme" or "Very high," please take extra precaution and follow ALL mandatory activity restrictions to protect yourselves, park neighbors, park staff, and the parklands.
