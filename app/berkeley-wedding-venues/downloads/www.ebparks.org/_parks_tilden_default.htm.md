South Park Drive Annual Closure for Newt Migration

**South Park Drive** in Tilden Park will be closed to vehicles from **November 1, 2025** through **March 31, 2026** for the protection of California newts as they utilize the road to migrate during the rainy season. Please adjust your travel plans by using other access routes such as **Shasta Road** or **Golf Course Drive**. **South Park Drive** will remain open to pedestrians and bicyclists. [More Info](/newts).

## 

Trail Closure

**Selby Trail** from Wildcat Canyon Road to Lake Anza is closed due to storm damage. Updated January 23, 2026.

## 

Trail Closure

**Selby Trail** in **Tilden Regional Park** between Grizzly Peak Blvd and Shasta Road will be closed intermittently for fuels reduction work between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., weekdays between Oct. 21, 2025 and Jan. 30, 2026. **Native Here Nursery** will be impacted by the work which will include temporary closures to the parking lot and driveway to the facility.

One of the District's three oldest parks, Tilden has been called the jewel of the system, and its recreational activities have become a happy tradition for generations of East Bay youngsters. From a carousel ride and a picnic to a swim at Lake Anza and a stroll through the Botanic Garden, Tilden has variety to delight everyone. Yet there are plenty of quiet places in Tilden's 2,079 acres to shelter the wildlife and preserve natural beauty.

Tilden was named for Charles Lee Tilden, first president of the Park District Board of Directors. The park is reached via Canon Drive, Shasta Road, or South Park Drive, all off Grizzly Peak Boulevard in Berkeley.

### Hiking and Biking

There are 39.41 miles of trails in Tilden Park, through many different kinds of terrain. The larger multi-use trails allow hikers, bicyclers, and horses, some are for hikers and horses only, and the smaller single-track trails are for hikers only. See the legend and trail designations on the trail map below for specific details. Trail mileage is marked in sections of the trails, and topographical lines give you information on the steepness of the terrain. Trail maps can be found on most of the bulletin boards at trailheads in the park, or you can print one yourself (see the Park Info tab above on the right).

Nimitz Way, paved and wheelchair accessible, is popular with hikers, bicyclists, and equestrians, and affords spectacular views from the crest of the East Bay hills. The best parking for this trail is at Inspiration Point on Wildcat Canyon Road. Please note there is no drinking water at this parking area, and dogs must be on a leash on Nimitz way. The East Bay Skyline National Recreation Trail follows Nimitz Way and other Tilden trails during part of its 31-mile route.

### Lake Anza Swim Beach

Just over the hill from Berkeley, Tilden Park's Lake Anza is a favorite getaway. Its sandy beach is open to the sun and sheltered from the wind, with lifeguards posted during the swim season. Wheelchair-accessible features include drinking water and ample parking (restrooms are not wheelchair accessible). Picnic grounds are located nearby. There is a beach access fee to the swim area, which has changing rooms. Swim season is normally from May through September and closed for swimming from November through March. Trails and picnic areas remain open year-round. Please note the trail around the lake is difficult terrain. The refreshment stand, The Lake Anza Beach Cafe, is open during the swim season. Dogs are **NOT** allowed in the swim facility. For more information regarding hours and swimming conditions, check the [Lake Anza swimming page.](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/lake-anza)

#### Swim Facilities Capacity Notice

Once the swim facility capacity is reached, there will be no new entries allowed for the remainder of the day (or at the discretion of the Park Supervisor), for the safety of the public. Please take this into consideration when planning your visit.
