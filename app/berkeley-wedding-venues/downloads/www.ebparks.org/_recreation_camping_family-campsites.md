# Family & Cabin Campsites 

__Back to top

Family campsites offer a more traditional camping experience with various site types (RV, Tent, Cabin, Hike-In) and amenities such as running water, flush toilets, showers, and seasonal campfire programs. There are three family campgrounds. 

## Family Campsites

Family campsites can accommodate a maximum of 8 people/site. 2 reservations per household/date. Family campsites can be reserved by phone or online, and drop-ins are accepted on a space available basis.

  * Family campsites are released on a rolling 12-week window.
  * Reservations must be made at least 2 business days prior to your arrival date. (Example: The last day to reserve for a Friday arrival date is Wednesday.) 



## Cabins

Primitive Cabins are offered at Del Valle Regional Park. These cabins sleep up to 5 people, offer air conditioning and heat, locking door, and small porch. A fire pit and picnic table are outside.

  * Cabin reservations must be made at least 3 business days prior to your arrival date. (Example: The last day to reserve for a Friday arrival date is the previous Tuesday.)
