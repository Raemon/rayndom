Within [Diablo Foothills Regional Park](/parks/diablo-foothills) is the Castle Rock Recreation Area which is located in a scenic canyon along Pine Creek. The area is dominated by oak woodlands and prominent sandstone formations.

Castle Rock has historically specialized in preparing picnic events for large groups of 300 or more people, but in 2007 the East Bay Regional Park District began renovating the park for drop-in as well as reservable picnic use. Catering service may also be available. Reservations may be made by calling [888-327-2757](tel:1-888-327-2757), press option 2. Note that there is no shuttle service into the park from the front gate. Bring a wagon to transport your heavy or bulky items. The distance from the front gate to the pool area is one-quarter mile, an average six-minute walk. The distance from the Orchard Staging Area to the pool area is one-half mile.

Diablo Foothills Regional Park and Castle Rock Park are bordered by Mt. Diablo State Park and Walnut Creek Open Space, providing access to more than 18,000 acres of public lands.

### Annual Closure Notice

The rock formations in Pine Canyon are currently closed effective February 1, reopening August 1, to protect nesting peregrine falcons. This protected species is highly territorial and sensitive to disturbance, especially during nesting season. Although the rock formations, known as Castle Rock, are in Mt. Diablo State Park, most visitors reach them through Diablo Foothills Regional Park. No other portions of the park are affected. We appreciate the public’s cooperation in helping us protect these species birds. For further information, please contact park staff at [(510) 544-3085](tel:1-510-544-3085).
