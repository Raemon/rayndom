This 87-acre area is a popular place for family and group picnicking. It is known for its lush setting in a grove of fragrant second growth redwood trees off Skyline Boulevard in Oakland. The original grove was logged between 1840 and 1860 to support the needs of a growing Bay Area community.




### Adopt a Park

Early in 1979 Roberts became the first park in the two county Regional Park District to be "adopted" by a local industry. An ongoing partnership was formed with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation, tapping the financial and human resources of the worldwide, Oakland based firm to assure the continued operation of this popular urban parkland.

The Adopt A Park program was developed in July 1978 after California citizens voted to change the state's tax structure, resulting in funding cutbacks for special districts and public agencies like EBRPD that were primarily dependent on property taxes for operation. For more information on how to help the District maintain its current parklands and services, call the Public Affairs Department at 1-888-EBPARKS (1-888-327-2757) or write to: East Bay Regional Park District, P.O. Box 5381, Oakland, CA 94605-0381, Attn: Public Affairs Department.

## Park Accessibility

Roberts Park has a new "Barrier Free" wheelchair accessible children's play area. The swim complex is fully accessible to individual with disabilities, including the bathhouse and an accessible lift into the pool.

## Attractions

Roberts Regional Recreation Area features a baseball field, playfields and a sand volleyball court (all available on a first come, first served basis). Roberts Park is also home to a new "Barrier Free" wheelchair accessible children's play area.

### The Redwoods

Because the Roberts entrance and parking area are in a grove of redwoods, it has proved to be a popular stop for tourists. This is the best access to redwoods for visitors who cannot hike a long distance or have failed to pack their favorite hiking shoes. Drop by for a moment...you'll want to stay longer.

The famous "landmark trees" were believed to have been located in or near Roberts Park; their location is marked by state historic plaque #962 near the Madrone picnic area. These were two giant redwoods used by sailors as navigational aids to avoid the treacherous Blossom Rock, submerged in the bay between Alcatraz Island and San Francisco. Captain F. Beechey of the Royal Navy noted in his log (1826) that in order to miss the rock, one should line up the northern tip of Yerba Buena Island with "two trees...south of Palos Colorados...too conspicuous to be overlooked." The distance from the sailors' ships to these trees was 16 miles, which attests to their size. Historical records indicate that the redwoods in this area ranged up to 20 feet or more in diameter.

Another redwood grove can be reached by entering Redwood Regional Park at the Redwood Gate entrance, two miles east of Skyline Boulevard on Redwood Road. Leave your car in the parking area and stroll along Stream Trail through the shady canyon.

### Old Growth Redwood Heritage Viewing Deck and Interpretive Exhibit

Peer into the Bay Area’s redwood past at the Old Growth Redwood Heritage Viewing Deck and Interpretive Exhibit, created in partnership with [Save the Redwoods League](https://www.savetheredwoods.org/redwood-matters/new-oakland-exhibit-reveals-history-of-areas-once-ancient-forest/) and unveiled in December 2018. For more than a century, a giant redwood tree stump has lain hidden along the Roberts Ridge/West Ridge Trail at Roberts Regional Recreation Area in the Oakland Hills. Those fortunate to discover it on their own, or as part of a parks program, have had limited opportunity to imagine the forest’s grandeur and days before aggressive logging destroyed it during the 1850s-60s. The new exhibit preserves an old growth footprint with an observation deck for future educational programs on Redwoods and climate change. To visit the viewing platform and interpretive exhibit, hike to the Redwood Bowl area along the Roberts Ridge Trail. [Press Release, December 2018](/about-us/whats-new/news/bay-areas-redwood-past)

### Swimming

Roberts Pool, now renovated, spans about 5,600 square feet with depths ranging from 3 to 9 feet and is heated. It serves recreational use, swim lessons, and training. Upgrades include a new pool deck, retaining walls, landscaping, entry kiosk, fencing, gates, and ADA-compliant parking and access. The facility also features a public changing area with gender-neutral and fully accessible restrooms.

## History

Roberts Regional Recreation Area opened for public recreation and enjoyment in 1952. The park was named to honor Thomas J. "Tommy" Roberts, who at that time had served as secretary to the East Bay Regional Park District board of directors for 24 years. He continued to serve on the board until his death in 1958 at age 95.
