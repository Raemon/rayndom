## Swim Beach Water Quality Program

Lake Temescal Beach is tested for bacterial levels weekly from April to October. The map below indicates the sample sites on the beach. The East Bay Regional Park District works with the Alameda County Environmental Health Department in accordance with California Department of Public Health's Guidance for Fresh Water Beaches to determine water quality at Lake Temescal Beach. Our stop light sign is used to display the relative water quality from our latest bacteriological tests and blue-green algae conditions.

**Water Quality Stop Light Designations:**

![Stoplight sign with water quality indicators](/sites/default/files/styles/original_800w_/public/Water_Quality_Stoplight_Sign.jpg?itok=tjmPDPqJ)

Please be advised there is always some level of risk when swimming in any water body. To have a fun and safe experience swimming in the parks, we encourage you to follow a few simple rules:

* Keep water out of your mouth  
* After you leave the water, shower and towel dry as soon as possible   
* Do not swim in the lake for 3 days after a rainstorm  
* Check posted signs for water quality information

For more information, visit the [Water Quality Stop Light Designations](/water-quality-stop-light-designations) page or contact the East Bay Regional Park District Water Management Department at [(510) 544-2328](tel:1-510-544-2328)
