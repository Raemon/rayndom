Swimming

![Del Valle Swim Beach](/sites/default/files/styles/original_800w_/public/DelValle-SwimBeach-PadmanRamankutty_041215.jpg?itok=l9qEouzQ)

[Del Valle Regional Park](/parks/del-valle) offers two swimming beaches with lifeguards on duty during posted periods. Year-round swimming is allowed without lifeguard service north of the boat ramp.

NOTE: Keep dogs away from the water.

## Swim Beach Water Quality Program

Del Valle Beaches are tested for bacterial levels weekly from April to October and twice a month from November to March. The map below indicates two sample sites on each beach. The East Bay Regional Park District works with the Alameda County Environmental Health Department in accordance with California Department of Public Health's Guidance for Fresh Water Beaches to determine water quality at Del Valle Beaches. Our stop light sign is used to display the relative water quality from our latest bacteriological tests and blue-green algae conditions.

**Water Quality Stop Light Designations:**

**Please be advised there is always some level of risk when swimming in any water body**. To have a fun and safe experience swimming in the parks, we encourage you to follow a few simple rules:

  * Keep water out of your mouth
  * After you leave the water, shower and towel dry as soon as possible 
  * Do not swim in the lake for 3 days after a rainstorm
  * Check posted signs for water quality information
