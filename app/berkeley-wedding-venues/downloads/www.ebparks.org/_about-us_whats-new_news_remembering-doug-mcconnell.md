#  Remembering Doug McConnell

### 

Honoring Bay Area Journalist’s Legacy of Connecting People to Nature

January 16, 2026

East Bay Regional Park District staff are deeply saddened by the passing of Doug McConnell, beloved longtime host of OpenRoad with Doug McConnell on NBC. Doug’s storytelling helped raise public awareness of the value of parks, trails, and community conservation efforts across Northern California and beyond, making outdoor exploration accessible and meaningful to a wider audience. 

The Park District worked with Doug McConnell and his crew many times over the past three decades to showcase East Bay Regional Parks, first on Bay Area Backroads and followed by his most recent show, OpenRoad. Together, we helped educate viewers about the importance of spending time in nature and the role conservation plays in ensuring future generations have the same opportunity. He was a thoughtful journalist whose commitment to community, collaboration, and public service left a lasting impact on the East Bay. We are grateful for his dedication and the positive spirit he brought to his work.

Doug first began working with the Park District in 1993, and this creative collaboration has continued through present day. Through this work, he became an integral part of the Park District's history, working closely with District staff on many projects. Doug was master of ceremonies at the District’s 65th and 75th anniversary events, Regional Parks Foundation signature events, and the Healthy Parks, Healthy People festival.

In a Jan. 14 statement issued by the OpenRoad team, his colleagues said, “Doug was grateful that his legacy continues, a legacy of joyfully encouraging everyone to explore and appreciate the beauty and diversity of our natural lands, and to celebrate the work so many of you are doing to restore and protect these natural places.” The Park District is honored to be included in Doug’s work and legacy.

Notable episodes featuring the Park District include:
