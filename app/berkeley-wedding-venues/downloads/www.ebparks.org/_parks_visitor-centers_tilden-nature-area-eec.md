Tilden Naturalist Programs

Join us for our monthly programs!

[ View Programs (PDF) (Opens in new window) ](/sites/default/files/TNA-January-2025-Program-Flyer.pdf?v=2&linkLoc=highlight)

The Tilden Environmental Education Center provides exhibits and public programs that highlight the diverse resources of the Tilden Nature Area. The District intends to replace the existing EEC with a new facility of a similar size. For more information about this project visit the [Tilden EEC Replacement Project](https://www.ebparks.org/tilden-eec-project) webpage.

The naturalist staff offers interpretive programs throughout the year. Thousands of urban youngsters have learned their first lessons about nature at the EEC, or met their first farm animal at the Little Farm next door. Naturalist-guided programs for school groups and other organized groups are available Tuesday through Friday by advance registration. See the [Field Trips](/programs/field-trips) page for details, or call the EEC at [(510) 544-2233](tel:1-510-544-2233). Weekend programs provide exciting opportunities to learn about natural and cultural history throughout the Park District's Northwest region. Check out our [program guides](/programs/naturalists) to download our monthly list of upcoming activities.

Inside the EEC you can explore exhibits that tell the story of the Wildcat Creek Watershed, find information on park activities, and purchase nature-related books and materials at the nature center store.
