### Resources

East Bay residents have a rich and varied fisheries resource in the District's eleven freshwater lakes, numerous ponds, streams, and miles of Bay and Delta shoreline. The District fisheries program protects, conserves, enhances, and restores native fish and amphibian species, and offers myriad recreational angling opportunities to the public. Angler use fees support fish planting programs and habitat enhancement projects that encourage the growth of the game fish population. As part of this effort, and in cooperation with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the District manages a major fresh water lake fishery enhancement program that includes habitat improvements and regular stocking of game fish.

### Fishing Information

**​**[The Anglers' Edge Newsletter](/anglers-edge-online). Fish planting information and latest fishing conditions.

The East Bay Regional Park District offers 11 lakes and reservoirs and over 25 miles of Bay/Delta shoreline and piers for fishing in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties. The District plants catchable rainbow trout, (fall through spring) and channel catfish, (summer) in cooperation with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife at [Del Valle](/parks/del-valle) (Livermore), [Lake Chabot](/parks/lake-chabot) (Castro Valley/San Leandro), [Shadow Cliffs](/parks/shadow-cliffs) (Pleasanton), Horseshoe Lake at [Quarry Lakes](/parks/quarry-lakes) (Union City/Fremont), [Contra Loma](/parks/contra-loma) (Antioch), [Don Castro](/parks/don-castro) (Hayward), and [Lake Temescal](/parks/temescal) (Oakland).

A [California Fishing License](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Licensing/Fishing) is required for anglers, (16+ years of age), to fish all eligible inland waters, (lakes, ponds and reservoirs) of the East Bay Regional Park District. Anglers 16+ years of age are required to purchase a [District Fishing Permit](/rentals-and-permits/permits/fishing-permit) in addition to having a valid State Fishing license. District lakes that **do not require a District Fishing Permit** include: [Lake Anza](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/tilden) (Berkeley), [Jordan Pond](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/garin) (Hayward) and [Shinn Pond](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/quarry-lakes) (Niles/Fremont).

The revenue generated from sales of these permits allows the District to plant rainbow trout and channel catfish, (1 - 12+ pounds ea.) on a weekly basis. The District and D.F.&G. plant over 200,000 pounds of catchable trout and catfish annually.
