Ardenwood Historic Farm offers a glimpse into life on a family farm between 1890 and 1930. Step back in time as you explore the remnants of the once vast estate of George and Clara Patterson, whose family farmed the land for over 100 years, beginning in the 1850s. East Bay Regional Park District has operated the property as a fully functioning, turn-of-the-last-century farm since 1985.

Today, Ardenwood demonstrates the role farms play in providing vital resources and fostering connections among people, plants, and animals. Using carefully restored farm machinery, staff and volunteers invite visitors to join in the harvest and processing of crops once common in the region, including corn, wheat, and hay. A farmyard with a variety of animals, a large hay barn, an outdoor kitchen, and a working blacksmith shop creates opportunities to make connections between everyday life, local farming history, and the land.

Since Ardenwood is a working farm, the daily activities change from season to season so no two visits will be exactly alike. Visit our [Naturalist Program](/programs/naturalists) page for more information and schedules before your next visit.

**Note: Dogs are not permitted in the park.** Modern recreational equipment (e.g., frisbees, footballs, soccer balls, bicycles, balloons, and BBQs) are prohibited.

## Park Accessibility

The majority of facilities in Ardenwood are wheelchair accessible: Patterson House, Hay Barn, Train Ride, Granary, Cafe, restrooms, and wedding and reception sites. Most of the roads are paved and there are no significant grade changes. [Public transit information](/parks/public-transit).

## Attractions

Some of the park features include the followings:

  * **Farm Animals:** At Ardenwood, you will see sheep, chickens, rabbits, goats, and cows. 

  * **Haybarn:** The historic Hay Barn houses tractors, farming implements, and tack, providing a glimpse into the tools and gear once essential for crop cultivation and the daily care of farm animals.

  * **Arden Station:** During the historic season (April-mid-November) on Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays, board the farm’s train here. It takes you back more than 100 years to a time when railroads connected the East Bay’s farms to towns and cities. The train is operated by Ardenwood’s Railroad Museum with staff and docents dressed in period costumes. For information, visit the [Society for the Preservation of Carter Railroad Resources (SPCRR) ](https://www.spcrr.org/)website.

  * **Patterson House:** During the historic season (April-mid-November) on Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays, costumed docents lead guided tours of the Patterson House. The home served three generations of the Patterson family and began as a modest farmhouse built by George Patterson in 1857. As the family's farm and standing in East Bay society grew, the house was expanded in 1889 with a grand Queen Anne–style addition.

  * **Blacksmith Shop:** On Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays, visit the blacksmith in the forge and see history come to life. Watch traditional tools and techniques in action while learning about the vital role blacksmiths played in supporting daily life on a working farm.
