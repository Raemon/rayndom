## Operations

Our Operations branch includes:

### Fire Captains

The five Fire Captains take command of emergency incidents and are each assigned to specific areas of expertise.

### Fire Lieutenants

There are two Fire Lieutenants who lead engine companies in emergency response, training, and day to day operations.

### Firefighters

There are eight permanent Firefighters. They respond to emergencies, maintain high levels of training, operate apparatus, and participate in fuels reduction projects.

### On-Call Firefighters

A special feature of the East Bay Regional Park District is the ability to utilize our talented workforce. On-Call Firefighters hold other positions throughout the Park District, such as Rangers, Mechanics, and Naturalists. They receive fire training and are able to serve as firefighters when called on.

### Join Our Team!
