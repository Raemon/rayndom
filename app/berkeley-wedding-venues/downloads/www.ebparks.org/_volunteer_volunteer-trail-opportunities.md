### Benefits of Trail Work

![volunteers walking downhill on a trail](/sites/default/files/styles/original_600w_/public/volunteer-trail-benefits.jpg?itok=mE9_LhMK)

If you like to be outside, chances are you have hiked, biked or ridden on a trail. Responsible trail work is essential to making sure our parks are accessible, sustainable and fun — all while maintaining an environmental ethic.

  * You can learn all about trails and how to maintain them by attending a volunteer trail day.
  * Learn the basics of responsible trail maintenance.
  * Get hands-on experience.
  * Get a good workout.
  * Learn about tools, trail dynamics and maintenance strategies — what makes a good trail?
  * Be outside and meet new people.



_You may wonder — do I need prior trail work experience?_ The answer is no. Part of working on a volunteer trail crew is learning.

Participants can include anyone in good physical condition: children (10 years and older), teens, adults and seniors. Children under 18 must be accompanied by an adult.

  * Students can earn community service hours.
  * Girl Scouts have earned credit toward the Backpacking Merit Badge and the Eco-Action Merit Badge.



### In the Spirit of Ivan Dickson

[Image ![Ivan Dickson Memorial](/sites/default/files/styles/original_600w_/public/ivan-dickson-memorial.jpg?itok=pkUv_Y31)](/sites/default/files/ivan-dickson-memorial.jpg)

High atop a ridge in Briones Regional Park sits a stone bench that hints at one of the East Bay’s most quietly remarkable figures. Inside the memorial—tucked behind a smiling bronze plaque—rest Ivan Dickson’s well-loved hiking loafers and one of his favorite beers. It’s a fitting tribute to a man who spent more than 60 years exploring the East Bay hills, often hiking 10–20 miles a day well into his eighties. A lifelong member of the Berkeley Hiking Club, Ivan lived simply, loved deeply, and found his greatest joy on the trail.

When Ivan passed away in 1993 at age 95, he left both a bequest and a request to the Park District: “take good care of the trails.” His generous gift launched the Ivan Dickson Volunteer Trail Maintenance Program, which for decades have brought thousands of volunteers together to prune brush, repair tread, build drain dips and steps, and care for the miles of paths that Ivan knew so well. Through more than 200 projects and over 42,000 hours of volunteer labor, the Ivan Dickson Trail Maintenance program not only improved trails across the District—it created a community of stewards who came to see the landscape through Ivan’s eyes.

Today, we strive to honor Ivan’s wish with our current trail programs: Programs that carry forward his spirit: small, hands-on workdays that teach practical skills, foster connection, and make a meaningful impact on the land. Whether repairing storm damage, trimming seasonal overgrowth, or shaping a hillside, volunteers continue the work Ivan inspired—helping ensure that our trails remain safe, beautiful, and welcoming for generations to come. His legacy is not just in the miles he walked, but in the countless footsteps that follow.
