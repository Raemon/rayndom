# Peralta Oaks North: Public Safety and Administrative Building Renovation

__Back to top

## Public Safety and Administrative Building Renovation Project

The East Bay Regional Park District has been headquartered in the Malcolm Hill/Chabot Park neighborhood at the end of Peralta Oaks Court since the 1990s. In 2019, the Park District purchased an adjacent building at 2955 Peralta Oaks Court to house its Public Safety Division and administrative staff. The building will provide space for police, fire, and administrative staff.

### **Construction Beginning: September, 2024**

The East Bay Regional Park District is ready to begin construction on its property at 2955 Peralta Oaks Court, Oakland, in September. The building, when renovated, will serve as an administrative headquarters building and home for the District’s Public Safety Division. The general contractor, Swinerton, will be installing temporary construction fencing around the entire perimeter of the property to facilitate construction activities for the project. Construction worker parking is on-site and will be accessed only from Peralta Oaks Court. Project material deliveries will be made from both Peralta Oaks Court and from Shelden Street. The Sheldon Street access is required for material deliveries only as needed and will only be made between the hours of 7 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. The District has hired Griffin Structures to manage construction on its behalf.

The site work hours are 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. The project duration is currently scheduled from fall 2024 through summer 2026.

We are excited for this milestone and appreciate your patience while this project is proceeding. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause.
