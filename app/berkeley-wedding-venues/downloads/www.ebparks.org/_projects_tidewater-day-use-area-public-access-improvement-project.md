Rendering of Future Entry Plaza for the Planned Tidewater Day Use Area

The Park District is designing and developing 8-acres of new parkland at the Tidewater Day Use Area of Martin Luther King Jr. Regional Shoreline (MLK), located in the City of Oakland, California. This new parkland will be adjacent to the exiting Tidewater Boating Center and is connected to the rest of MLK by the San Francisco Bay Trail. Several public meetings and input opportunities will be provided to the public throughout the year. To be added to the project mailing list, please contact Toby Perry at: [[email protected]](https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=tperry@ebparks.org&su=Tidewater%20Day%20Use%20Area%20Public%20Access%20Improvement%20Project).

## Site Description

The Martin Luther King Jr. Regional Shoreline Tidewater Day Use Area is located at the edge of the Oakland Estuary, a site that is already a popular destination for hikers, bicyclists and rowers. A new 7-acre park expansion will provide a new recreational destination along the Oakland Estuary, with small and large group picnic spaces, a multi-use lawn, restroom facilities and a nature play area for children. A network of pathways will lead visitors through the park to gathering spaces for educational or recreational outings. The park will also serve as a staging area for hikers and bicyclists using the San Francisco Bay Trail and for small-craft boaters using the boat launch for the San Francisco Bay Water Trail.

## History

A land use development plan (LUDP) was developed for MLK Shoreline in 1977 that provided guidance for future park development on the parcel currently planned for the 7-acre Tidewater Day Use Area expansion. This plan called for tree plantings, a picnic area, and meadows. East Bay Regional Park District acquired this parcel of land in 1979. Since that time, a master plan was developed that also included parking and restrooms. Since its acquisition the parcel of land had been leased to a trucking company for storage of truck chassis. The lease was terminated in 2017 in anticipation of developing the new parkland.
