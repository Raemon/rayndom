### Volunteer Opportunities at the Regional Parks Botanic Garden

There are several ways you can support the [Regional Parks Botanic Garden](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/tilden/botanic-garden) as a volunteer:

  1. Become a docent and lead tours of the Botanic Garden for weekend visitors and/or school groups during the week. Docent training is offered once each year, usually in the winter/spring, with more than 20 weekly sessions of three-and-a-half hours each. Docent training is comprehensive, covering everything from basic botany to California plant ecology and interpretive techniques, and it is backed up by subsequent enrichment classes, including field trips. Email: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e8aaaf899a8c8d86a88d8a98899a839bc6879a8f "BGarden@ebparks.org") for more information.  
Visit the Friends website for more information on the content of the docent training classes and schedule: [www.nativeplants.org](http://www.nativeplants.org/).  

  2. Become a Garden Greeter to welcome our visitors from around the Bay and around the world on weekends and holidays. The next Garden Greeter training will be on November 1, 2025 and November 8, 2025 from 9:00 to 11:00 (both days required). The training is free. Email: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f5b7b2948791909bb590978594879e86db9a8792) for more information and sign up.  

  3. Help propagate and maintain potted California native plants offered for sale to the public to support the Botanic Garden. Plant sale volunteers meet at the garden in the potting shed area of the Juniper Lodge building on most Wednesday mornings between 9:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.. Many of the volunteers are experienced horticulturists, but experience isn’t necessary; volunteering for the plant sale is an excellent way to learn about native plants. Email: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f7b5b09685939299b792958796859c84d9988590c88482959d929483cabe999198859a96839e9899d2c5c7879b92968492d6) for more information.  

  4. Help maintain the garden (light gardening work such as weeding, raking, nursery work) under the supervision of the garden supervisor, usually working closely with a gardener. If you can donate your time on a regular basis (once a week, twice a month, etc.) and have some gardening experience. Email: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bdfffadccfd9d8d3fdd8dfcddccfd6ce93d2cfda82cec8dfd7d8dec980f4d3dbd2cfd0dcc9d4d2d3988f8dcdd1d8dcced89c) for more information.  

  5. Work with the board of the Friends of the Regional Parks Botanic Garden in publicizing and raising funds for the Botanic Garden through many different types of activities. No experience is needed, just a love of the garden and a desire to help. Friends board meetings are usually held in the Botanic Garden's Visitor Center auditorium on the second Wednesday of each month at 10:00 a.m., and everyone is welcome to attend. Email: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#96fff8f0f9d6f8f7e2ffe0f3e6faf7f8e2e5b8f9e4f1 "info@nativeplants.org") for more information.
