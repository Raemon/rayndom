# Special Event Permits

__Back to top

Planning to host an event in a Regional Park? Many activities require a Special Event Permit to ensure the safety of participants, protect park resources, and minimize impacts on other visitors. Permits help us coordinate logistics such as parking, staffing, and site availability so your event can run smoothly.

### **A Special Event Permit is required for:**

Organized group activities such as hikes, walks, runs, bike rides, athletic competitions, youth camps or educational programs, orienteering, swimming or equestrian events, art or music festivals, and religious or cultural events.

In addition, a permit is required for events that meet one or more of the following conditions:

  * **Open to the public**
  * **Advertised or promoted** , including flyers, mailers, websites, or social media
  * **Charge a participation or admission fee** , including ticket sales or required donations
  * **Require partial or exclusive use of an area** , such as fields, facilities, or parking lots
  * **Significantly impact public access or right-of-way** , including traffic increases, road closures, or trail impacts
  * **Sponsored by non-EBRPD agencies or individuals** as smaller or ongoing classes, programs, or events
  * **Go beyond the scope of normal park use** , such as reserving multiple sites, using amplified sound or music, selling beer or wine, setting up staging or structures, or hosting other commercial activities.



If you are not sure whether your event requires a special event permit, please email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ca99baafa9a3aba68fbcafa4be9aafb8a7a3be8aafa8baabb8a1b9e4a5b8ad) with information about your requested activity (event date and time, location, number of people, and a short description).
