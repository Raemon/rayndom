Please enjoy our Regional Parks safely, and help us protect and preserve your parklands by complying with park rules and regulations.

**Safety and Etiquette**

  * Ride on open trails only. See [www.ebparks.org](https://www.ebparks.org) for notices of trail closures. Ask park staff for clarification if you are uncertain about the status of a trail.
  * Stay on existing trails and do not create new ones. Don’t make shortcuts on switchbacks.
  * Don’t ride your bike on trails marked “No Bikes.”
  * Wet and muddy trails are more vulnerable to damage than dry trails. When the trail is soft, consider other riding options.
  * Do not trespass on private land and respect closures. Be aware that bicycles are not permitted on all District trails.
  * Leave no trace. If you pack it in, pack it out.
  * Control your bicycle. Obey all bicycle speed regulations and ride within your limits.
  * Park off of the trail to keep the trail clear for other users and emergency vehicles.
  * Yield to others. Bicyclists yield to all trail users. Ring your bell to alert trail users and let them know the number in your party. Anticipate other trail users as you ride around corners. Bicyclists traveling downhill yield to bicyclists headed uphill. Strive to make each pass a safe and courteous one.
  * Never scare animals. Running cattle and disturbing wildlife are serious offenses. Animals are easily startled by an unannounced approach. Give animals enough room and time to adjust to your presence. When passing horses, slow down or dismount, alert the rider, and follow their directions (ask if you are uncertain.
  * Always wear a helmet and wear appropriate safety gear.
