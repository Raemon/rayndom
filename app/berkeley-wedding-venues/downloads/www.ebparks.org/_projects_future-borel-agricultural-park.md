## Overview

The East Bay Regional Park District is developing an agricultural park at the site of the former homestead and orchard property belonging to Armand Borel. Development of the future agricultural park requires planning and design services to determine what is feasible and desirable at the future park.

The community survey has ended. Thanks for providing your input! Additional outreach activities will be scheduled in the coming months.

## Site Description

The Borel family owned and operated one of the last remaining family farms in the San Ramon Valley. They cultivated a walnut orchard and small shelling and packing operation between 1923 and the 1970s. In 2009, Armand Borel bequeathed the property to the Park District to offer interpretive and education opportunities on agricultural history of the area. This parcel is located east of the I-680 freeway on the north side of Fostoria Way within the Town of Danville, adjacent to the City of San Ramon. The property is the last remaining piece of an approximately 60-acre family farm that encompassed much of this portion of the San Ramon Valley and retains the walnut tree orchard from that time.

**Image 1: The Borel property was one of the last remaining family orchards of San Ramon Valley.**

**Image 2: Feasibility studies will determine which existing structures and equipment can be retained and used for educational and interpretive purposes.**

## Timeline

**2024:** Project planning kicked off with the hiring of a consultant team to conduct technical and feasibility studies.

**2025:**

  * **February** : Initial public outreach began with an online public survey to determine what the public wants to see at the Borel Agricultural Park. Park District staff attended several public events to promote the survey and future park.
  * **June** : Technical and feasibility studies finished by Placeworks. Work began on the three conceptual designs.
  * **September** : Three Borel Agricultural Park design concept alternatives are released to the public. These designs incorporate both public and internal Park District input to create three feasible design alternatives.
