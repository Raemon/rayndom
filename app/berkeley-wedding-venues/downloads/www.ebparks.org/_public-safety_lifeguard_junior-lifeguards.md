# Junior Lifeguards (8-12)

__Back to top

## Junior Lifeguards - Ages 8-12

The East Bay Regional Park District’s Junior Lifeguard Program is designed to provide the youth of our community with quality water safety education. Six week-long training sessions are offered between June and August.

This dynamic, inclusive summer program provides participants of all abilities, ages 8 to 12, with an introduction to water safety/ rescue, first aid, and CPR in a fun and challenging environment. Each day, participants enjoy a variety of beach and water activities designed to promote fitness, self-esteem, and teamwork.

Focus is given to personal safety and skills that will benefit their community. In addition to the extensive Junior Lifeguard core curriculum, each week-long session will emphasize a specific theme. Theme-based lessons and activities will be complemented by discussions, skills, games, and physical activities derived from the Junior Lifeguard core curriculum.

Participants will receive a commemorative pin recognizing their accomplishment at the end of each session. Participants are encouraged to bring multiple towels, sunscreen, sun protection, and a set of sweats for cold days. If a registrant requires disabled accommodations, please contact Aaron Roth at [(510) 690-6624](tel:\(510\) 690-6624), or [[email protected]](email:aroth@ebparks.org), about specific accommodations needed.

### Program Information

Participants must be 8 to 12 years of age, demonstrate that they can tread water, and pass a 25-yard swim test on the first day of each session. Parents must be present for this swim test. Pre-testing is available at all facilities that have a Junior Lifeguard program. Instructors will evaluate swimmers based on their swimming competence and confidence.

**Locations:** Cull Canyon, Castro Valley and Crown beach, Alameda.

**Schedule:** Each session runs for one week, Monday – Friday. Participants can be dropped off between 8:30-9 a.m. and they must be picked up between 4-4:30 p.m. There is one snack break during the morning and afternoon, so please pack a healthy snack and drink. Participants are responsible for providing their own lunch. Lunchtime is monitored by instructors from noon-1pm

**Financial Aid:** The Regional Parks Foundation provides financial assistance to families in need. View [Campership Financial Aid](/financial-aid)**** info.

**Registration: Registration for Junior Lifeguard Program will open April 1, 2025.**
