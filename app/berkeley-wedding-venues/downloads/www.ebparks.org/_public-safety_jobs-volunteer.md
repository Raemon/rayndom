## Public Safety Volunteer Opportunities

### Volunteer Trail Safety Patrol

The District Police Department's Volunteer Coordinator supervises the District's Volunteer Trail Safety Patrol, whose many members enjoy riding and hiking District trails and interacting with the public. The Volunteer Trail Safety Patrol comprises five patrol groups: the Volunteer Mounted Patrol, the Volunteer Bicycle Patrol, the Volunteer Hiking Patrol, the Companion Dog Patrol, and the Volunteer Marine Safety Unit.

The purpose of the Volunteer Trail Safety Patrol is to assist the East Bay Regional Park District and its Public Safety Department in the safe, effective management of parklands. Members receive training in all facets of park user safety and are charged with a duty to Observe, Educate, Report...and Enjoy. The Volunteer Trail Safety Patrol promotes safe and courteous park and trail use by District visitors. Patrol members provide visitors with educational information, and they forward to park and public safety personnel their observations of facility safety or law enforcement issues. Many patrol members are equipped with District two-way radios or personal cellular phones. Patrol members seek to maintain positive relationships among trail user groups and to project a professional image of the District.

For more information about this program and to request membership information, please [visit the Volunteer Trail Safety Patrol website](http://www.parkpatrol.org/ "Click here to visit the Volunteer Trail Safety Patrol website, opens a new browser window").
