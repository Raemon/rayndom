**In case of Emergency/Incident in Progress, call 911 or[(510) 881-1121](tel:1-510-881-1121)** from a cell.  
For Non-Emergencies, call [(510) 881-1833](tel:1-510-881-1833), or submit a [Park Watch Report](https://www.ebparks.org/public-safety/incident/park-watch-report) online.

## Water Safety Tips

  * If you’re unsure of your swimming abilities, wear a life-jacket.
  * Each of our swim facilities has free loaner life jackets available.
  * Keep a close eye on your children. Drowning can occur quickly and silently, even in a foot of water.
  * Refrain from drinking alcohol if you plan on swimming.
  * Only swim in areas with a lifeguard on duty.
  * Boats must have life-jackets for every person on board. Those under age 16 must wear life-jackets while on a boat. [State of California boating safety laws](https://dbw.parks.ca.gov/).
  * If you’re not a strong swimmer, take swim lessons! The Park District and most East Bay cities offer [Swim Lessons](/public-safety/lifeguard-services/lifeguard-services-swim-lesson-program) throughout the summer.



## Water Safety Notices

### No lifeguard service is provided at bay beaches

Swimming at your own risk is allowed in designated areas and when lifeguards are off duty at some parks. These include Del Valle, Shadow Cliffs, Lake Anza, Quarry Lakes, and Lake Temescal.

**_PLEASE NOTE_ :** All lifeguard service operates depending on weather, water level, water quality, staffing availability and visitation. When lifeguards are not on duty, swimming is permitted only in a designated area, and at a swimmer's own risk. Children must be supervised by a responsible adult.

Lifeguards initiate a 15-minute swim break at 1:00pm, 3:00pm and 5:00pm each day. Children 15 years and younger must completely exit the water during this time. This is a good time for children to rest, re-warm and use the restroom. Groups should review the [Group Swim Procedures](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/groups) page before planning a visit.

**Alcoholic beverages, dogs, glass containers, fishing, or barbecues are prohibited at ALL swimming areas.** Incontinent individuals are prohibited from water contact activities in non-chlorinated swimming areas. ([Ordinance 38](https://library.municode.com/ca/east_bay_regional_park_district/codes/ordinance_38_-_rules_and_regulations?nodeId=CHIVPAUSEN_S401SW)). This applies to the swimming areas of Del Valle, Crown Beach, Miller/Knox, Temescal, Quarry Lakes, Shadow Cliffs, and Tilden.

Swimmers must follow all [Posted Regulations (PDF)](https://www.ebparks.org/sites/default/files/ebrpd_swimming_safety_information_02-05-2009.pdf "Regulations")

### Special Water Safety Notices for Children

Children 12 years old and under are not permitted in the swimming area unless accompanied by a responsible, actively supervising, individual 16 years old or older. 

Swimmers at [Contra Loma](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/contra-loma), [Cull Canyon](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/cull-canyon), [Roberts Pool](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/roberts), [Castle Rock](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/castle-rock) pool, [Don Castro](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/don-castro), [Lake Temescal](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/lake-temescal), [Lake Anza](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/lake-anza), and [Quarry Lakes](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/niles-beach) who wish to enter chest-deep water, are required to wear an identifying wristband, issued by the lifeguards. This band indicates you have passed a swim test.

Swim diapers are required at chlorinated swim facilities: [Contra Loma](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/contra-loma), [Cull Canyon](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/cull-canyon), [Castle Rock](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/castle-rock), [Don Castro](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/don-castro), and [Roberts](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/roberts).
