## Overview

**UN International Day of Peace 2026  
Monday, September 21, 2026**

In today’s world with all the political, environmental, and many forms of injustices impacting communities and the environment it can be overwhelming on where to begin when it comes to creating change and peace. The United Nations theme this year for International Day of Peace is “Act Now for a Peaceful World”.

Join us this International Day of Peace with the Eden Area Interfaith Council and United Nations East Bay Chapter for an intentional gathering. Build community, engage in dialogue and reflection with this year's theme, hear community peace messages, and enjoy activities, music, and food.

In 1981, The UN established September 21st to be the International Day of Peace. The UN General Assembly encourages all nations to observe 24 hours of non-violence and cease-fire, and to practice kindness and compassion on this day. Since 2018, the Park District has celebrated this day with a community event at Lake Chabot Regional Park.

In September 2021, we installed the [Peace Pole](https://www.ebparks.org/sites/default/files/PeacePoleInterpPanel.pdf) at Lake Chabot. In October 2021, the Park District received the [Global Citizen Award](/public-info/awards/un-global-citizen) which recognizes our contributions towards peace and the[ UN 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) In 2023, we received the Award of Distinction for Outstanding Event from the California Association of Recreation and Park Districts ([CARPD](http://www.carpd.net/)) for the UN International Day of Peace event.
