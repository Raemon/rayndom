# Lifeguard Services - History

__Back to top

## **History**

The East Bay Regional Park District’s Lifeguard Service has a long tradition of providing top quality public service by enhancing swimming safety. This brief look at the history of swim areas and lifeguard services should give staff some context in recognizing the important role they play in this valuable public service.

California history is punctuated with water wars affecting its preservation, control, and use. The lakes and reservoirs of California are an integral part of this struggle. Even before California became a state, inhabitants wrestled with water issues. Efforts made by Californians are major factors in what makes the state not only habitable but prized by so many.

The East Bay Regional Park District recognizes lakes and reservoirs as precious natural resources. In fact, water issues triggered the public will to establish the EBRPD. In the early 1920’s, East Bay leaders realized that in order for economic and population growth to continue, they needed to secure water. The result was the formation of what became the East Bay Municipal Utilities District, who developed a water supply from the Sierra Nevada watershed via the Mokelumne River and Pardee reservoir.

By 1931 the Wildcat Creek watershed became unnecessary to EBMUD. So, to prevent them from selling the land to private developers, the EBRPD was created with the intent to preserve the area as parkland. The District continues to acquire, maintain, and operate watershed land and reservoirs throughout the East Bay, fulfilling its mission to balance public use with protection and preservation of our natural resources for generations to come.

## **Swim Area Beginnings**

The first reservoir the EBPRD acquired was Lake Temescal, in Oakland. It was created in 1868 in order to give Oakland its first city water supply (but was soon relegated to a secondary water source). By 1936, Lake Temescal was used just for recreation and joined Wildcat Canyon (now Tilden Regional Park) and Roundtop (now Sibley Regional Volcanic Preserve) as the EBRPD’s first 3 parks. Another area reservoir, Lake Anza in Tilden Regional Park, was created by the Civilian Conservation Corps building a dam in the upper Wildcat Gorge in 1938, as part of Franklin Roosevelt’s “New Deal” to promote economic recovery. Swimming at these two locations continues today.

In 1953, Roberts Pool was constructed in the redwood forest of the Oakland Hills, thus creating the first swimming pool of the District.

The creations of Cull Canyon and then Don Castro have the Davis Grunsky Act of 1960 to thank for their origins. The act was a statewide program that provided financial aid to local public agencies for the development, control, and conservation of the water resources of California. In the early 1960’s Alameda County Flood Control District built dams on Cull Creek (for Cull Canyon) and San Lorenzo Creek (for Don Castro) and reached an agreement with the Park District to operate the facilities for recreation. In 1964 Cull Canyon lagoon opened and in 1966 it won the Governor’s Design award for Exceptional Distinction for Recreational Development. By 1969 Don Castro’s swim lagoon was operating with lifeguards.

The next EBRPD location to allow lake swimming was Contra Loma reservoir in Antioch. The reservoir was created as part of the Central Valley Project, one of the Nation’s major water conservation developments, and is an off-stream storage facility for the Contra Costa Canal. The dam was dedicated in November 1967, with a portion of the lake open for swimming in 1968. By 2002 a swimming lagoon was opened at Contra Loma, taking recreational swimming out of the reservoir.

Near the time that Contra Loma was built, development was taking place on the State Water Project in Livermore. In 1968, the dam for Lake Del Valle was built as part of the South Bay Aqueduct portion of the Project. The reservoir provides water storage and flood control for Alameda Creek. Interestingly, the Hetch Hetchy pipeline, built well before the reservoir, goes under the lake but does not connect to it. The campground and other amenities took two years to complete, so, the official park opening was in April 1970. 

The next reservoir swimming area to be developed was Shadow Cliffs in Pleasanton; a rock quarry donated to the EBRPD by Kaiser Industries. Facilities were built in 1971 with funding from a matching grant provided by the U.S. Bureau of Outdoor Recreation.

The most recent District lake swimming facility developed was Quarry Lakes in Fremont which opened for public use in 2001. The quarries, for which the park is named, were established in the mid-19th century to gather gravel for the construction of the transcontinental railroad's western section. After quarrying came to an end, the lakes were used for groundwater recharge by the Alameda County Water District, which diverts water from Alameda Creek into the pits. The property that now comprises the park was acquired by the two agencies between 1975 and 1992 through purchase, donation, and inter-agency agreements. The park is made up of three lakes: Horseshoe (which allows swimming), Lago Los Osos, and Rainbow Lake. Of the park's 450 acres, some 350 acres are the lakes. Lifeguards also provided service at Camp Arroyo for the 2001, 2002, 2019, and 2021 seasons.

Castle Rock pool in Diablo Foothills Regional Park was first lifeguarded by District lifeguards in 2008 when the District took over operations from a private concessionaire.

##  **Lifeguard Service History**

According to the 1968 aquatics division annual report, Aquatic Supervisor Robert O’Brien states, “Prior to 1965, accurate written records of the swimming program were not kept.” In spite of this, there’s a newspaper article in the District’s archives from 1938 that describes a District Lake Temescal lifeguard responding to aid an electrocuted lineman near the lake.

2018 represented the 80th year of District lifeguard service. Following are some points of trivia:

  * 1937: District Board of Directors announces in a press release free swimming at Lake Temescal. They expect attendance records to be broken.
