#  East Bay Regional Park District Expands Hayward Regional Shoreline with Landmark Land Acquisition

### 

Addition Supports Marsh Restoration and San Francisco Bay Trail Access

December 30, 2025

The East Bay Regional Park District has acquired approximately 77 acres of shoreline property from the Hayward Area Recreation and Park District (H.A.R.D.), strengthening long-term efforts to restore vital marsh habitat, prepare for sea level rise, and secure permanent public access along the San Francisco Bay Trail at Hayward Regional Shoreline.

The agreement transfers the property to the Park District and permanently protects a segment of the San Francisco Bay Trail through the acquisition of the parcel plus an access easement connecting the parcel to Breakwater Avenue. This segment of the San Francisco Bay Trail has been open to the public, but with these more robust and durable property rights granted to the District, that segment of trail is now protected in perpetuity. H.A.R.D., a long-time partner with the Park District in shoreline protection, will retain ownership of approximately five acres that house the popular Hayward Shoreline Interpretive Center, ensuring continued educational and recreational use.

“This acquisition allows us to take a major step forward in protecting and restoring the Hayward Marsh while ensuring continued public access to one of the Bay Area’s most important shoreline corridors,” said Max Korten, East Bay Regional Park District’s Acting General Manager. “By consolidating land ownership, we can better manage habitat, improve resilience to sea level rise, and support wildlife and visitors alike. We are thankful for our longstanding partnership with H.A.R.D and their role in helping to support this acquisition.”

The Hayward shoreline is largely located in the Park District’s Ward 3, represented by Director Dennis Waespi, and also abuts Ward 4, represented by Director Luana España. Each has expressed excitement for this important acquisition.

“Strengthening environmental resilience through projects like Hayward Marsh restoration is a Park District priority” said Waespi. “This acquisition ensures that restoration efforts and public access move forward together, benefiting the community and local habitat for generations to come.” 

“Through this acquisition, the Hayward Regional Shoreline continues to evolve into a prime example of how wildlife habitat restoration, public access and recreation, and resilience can co-exist” added España. “What were once industrial salt ponds are now a home to snowy plovers and a place for the public to enjoy nature along our beautiful restored shoreline.” 

**Supporting the Restore Hayward Marsh Project**  
The newly acquired property lies within the footprint of the [Restore Hayward Marsh project](/projects/restore-hayward-marsh-project), a large-scale, multi-benefit effort aimed at adapting the marsh landscape to rising sea levels while enhancing wildlife habitat and maintaining public recreation. Planned restoration activities include levee improvements and strategic breaches, creation of new bird nesting islands, improved tidal channel circulation, and the establishment of upland transition zones critical for marsh-dependent species.

Ownership of the property in fee title will give the Park District the flexibility and access needed to carry out restoration construction, manage long-term stewardship, and coordinate closely with partners such as the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory, which monitors western snowy plover nesting in nearby habitats.

**A Legacy of Shoreline Restoration**  
Originally donated to H.A.R.D. in 1980 by the Leslie Salt Company, the property is part of a broader regional legacy of converting former industrial salt ponds and landfill areas into restored wetlands and public open space. This transfer continues that legacy by unifying stewardship under the East Bay Regional Park District and aligning management with regional restoration and climate adaptation goals.

**Funding**  
The acquisition is funded through Measure WW, with costs limited to due diligence, title and escrow, and minor safety and signage improvements.
