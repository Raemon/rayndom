## Overview

The District’s Board of Directors approved the [Oyster Bay Regional Shoreline](/parks/oyster-bay) Land Use Plan Amendment (LUPA) in 2013. The LUPA guides the future development of Oyster Bay with plans that include including a new primary access and parking, formalization of the trail system, resource management, a bicycle skills area, a disc golf course, and a dedicated off-leash dog area. As of December 2021, the 18-hole disc golf course is open, the primary entrance is on Neptune Drive, and native shrubs and trees have been planted to provide overwintering opportunities for Monarch butterflies. The Opportunity Fill & Grading effort will continue through 2022 with trucks delivering clean fill to raise and sculpt the topography of the park.

In 2022 and beyond, the Park District is proceeding with design of the park access roadway off of Neptune Drive and connecting staging areas that will provide parking inside the park near picnic areas, the disc golf course, future events and bike skills area.

**August 2025 Update:** Over the past several years the District has been working with contractors operating under a no cost contract to import clean fill to bring the grades at the site up to levels per the approved Land Use Plan. This phase of the project has been completed.

The next phase of the site improvements will be the construction of a new parking lot and staging area. The improvements for this phase of the overall site development will include the installation of new sewer and water service, full-service restrooms, a new parking lot and staging area for park users, landscaping to provide butterfly and pollinator habitat and way finding signage. The District anticipates beginning construction on this phase of work in the Summer of 2026.




## Site Description

### Opportunity Fill and Grading project:

This ongoing project is part of the Park District’s efforts to build up the topography of the park and to create the base for future recreation areas outlined in the District’s Oyster Bay 2013 LUPA. The Opportunity Fill & Grading effort is complete in the Southwest Disc Golf Course area which opened in October 2021 and offers of eighteen holes each with a forward and advanced tee & basket for beginners and experienced players.

Fill and grading continues in the center north area of the park to prepare the site for development of an informal events area, future parking & picnic and eventual installation of the first phase of a bike skills park. Please observe signs about areas that might be closed to the public during this project.

## History

The Park is located just south of the Oakland International Airport in San Leandro, a site that was a former landfill, closed in the early 1970s, and acquired by the District in the 1980’s for future park development. The Park now includes two miles of the San Francisco Bay Trail around the perimeter. It is a popular destination for hikers, dog walkers, bicyclists and bird watchers. This park includes seven group picnic areas with interior trails that lead to sweeping Bay vistas and a public sculpture, “Rising Wave.” A new 30-acre disc golf course is open in the park as of October, 2021
