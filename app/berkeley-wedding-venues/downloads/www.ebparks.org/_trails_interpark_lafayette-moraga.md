Trail Width Restrictions

Pacific Gas and Electric will be conducting vegetation management along the **Lafayette Moraga Trail** , in select areas from Oliveira Lane to the Lafayette Community Center in Lafayette. Trail width will be restricted during periods of brush removal. Updated January 23, 2026.

The Lafayette-Moraga Regional Trail, a 7.65-mile linear park, parallels St. Mary's Road through Lafayette and Moraga. It is intended for hiking, bicycling, and equestrian use.

Coursing through the Moraga Valley, connecting Las Trampas Ridge to the Oakland Hills, and the cities of Lafayette and Moraga, this trail corridor has a rich and varied history. This trail was once used by mule trains to carry redwood from Oakland to Sacramento. Later, when the mule trails had passed into history, the lumber was carried by steam trains, including the Oakland-Antioch and Eastern Railroad, the San Francisco-Sacramento, and the Sacramento Northern, for which the easement was historically named. With the abandonment of the railroads the corridor became a utility easement, and, ultimately, with the cooperation of local communities, utility districts and the East Bay Regional Park District, a paved multi-use recreational trail was established serving hikers, bicyclists, and equestrians.

The north end of the trail begins at A staging area at Olympic Boulevard and Pleasant Hill Road in Lafayette, south of Highway 24, and ends at East Bay Municipal Utility District's (EBMUD) Valle Vista staging area at the outskirts of Moraga, bordering San Leandro Reservoir and Reinhardt Redwood Regional Park. (A permit is required to hike in EBMUD lands; call [(510) 287-0469](tel:1-510-287-0469).) The trail makes connections to a variety of schools (including St. Mary's College), regional trails (Briones-to-Las Trampas), local parks (Moraga Commons), and commercial areas in downtown Moraga. One of the first rail-trails in California, this 10-foot-wide recreational trail offers residential access, regional connections, scenic areas, and convenience to local facilities. It is accessible to persons in wheelchairs.

The trail is maintained and operated by the East Bay Regional Park District. It was established largely along utility right-of-way in cooperation with the cities of Lafayette and Moraga, the Central Contra Costa Sanitary District, EBMUD, and Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
