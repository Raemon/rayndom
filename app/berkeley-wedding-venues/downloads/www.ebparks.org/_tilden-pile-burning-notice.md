# Tilden Pile Burning Notice

__Back to top

East Bay Regional Parks will be burning piles for fuels reduction in the **Tilden Nature Area** at**Charles Lee Tilden Regional Park** near Jewel Lake every Wednesday and Thursday beginning Dec. 4, 2025 and continuing through February or March 2026 until all piles have been burned. Burn days may be cancelled due to unfavorable weather. Ignitions will generally begin at 10 a.m. and piles should be extinguished before nightfall. These times may vary.

Visitors should expect to see or smell smoke and live fire. People who are sensitive to smoke should avoid the area during burn operations. Fire personnel will be actively working in the area with fire engines, pumps, and hoses. Hazards such as smoke, fire, and obstacles across trails will be present. Stay out of closed areas and follow fire staff directions.

Wildcat Creek Trail and the Loop Road will remain open. Portions of the Jewel Lake Trail will be closed intermittently during burn operations. Detours will be available.

The East Bay Regional Park District conducts prescribed fires and other fuels reduction activities to reduce wildfire danger and maintain resilient ecosystems. Burns are implemented by trained personnel following strict guidelines. These pile burns are part of the Tilden Nature Area Wildfire Resilience Project, funded by a California State Coastal Conservancy Grant.
