South Park Drive Annual Closure for Newt Migration

**South Park Drive** in Tilden Park will be closed to vehicles from **November 1, 2025** through **March 31, 2026** for the protection of California newts as they utilize the road to migrate during the rainy season. Please adjust your travel plans by using other access routes such as **Shasta Road** or **Golf Course Drive**. **South Park Drive** will remain open to pedestrians and bicyclists. [More Info](/newts).

Tilden Nature Area is a 740-acre preserve located just North of Tilden Regional Park. With over 10 miles of hiking trails, the preserve contains a blend of native and introduced plant communities, including oak/bay woodlands, grasslands, eucalyptus forests, and streams. Hikes range from the leisurely, self-guided Jewel Lake Nature Trail to a vigorous climb up Wildcat Peak (elevation 1,211 ft.) for panoramic, San Francisco Bay views. A 750-foot boardwalk through the woods leads to Jewel Lake, a historic reservoir and waterworks, and a peaceful place to watch wildlife.

At Tilden Nature Area one can also find the renowned Environmental Education Center (EEC), the headquarters for the area's interpretive programs, and the historic Little Farm.

**Notice: Dogs are not allowed in the Tilden Nature Area.**
