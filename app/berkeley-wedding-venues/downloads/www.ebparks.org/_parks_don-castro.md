Don Castro Regional Park is a 101-acre urban oasis on the boundary between Hayward and Castro Valley. The clear blue waters of the swim lagoon are a favorite with central Alameda County residents. The lagoon and adjacent lake were created in 1964 when the Alameda Flood Control and Water Conservation District dammed San Lorenzo Creek.

They require an assistant to push and are not intended to enter the water. To arrange for use of a chair, call the park office at [(510) 544-3073](tel:1-510-544-3073). Arrangements will be made to bring the chair out to the beach. It takes approximately 15 minutes to prepare the chair.
