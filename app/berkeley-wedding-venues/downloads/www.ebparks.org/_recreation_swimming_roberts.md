Swimming

Located in [Roberts Regional Recreation Area](/parks/roberts), the Roberts Pool, now renovated, spans about 5,600 square feet with depths ranging from 3 to 9 feet and is heated. It serves recreational use, swim lessons, and training. Upgrades include a new pool deck, retaining walls, landscaping, entry kiosk, fencing, gates, and ADA-compliant parking and access. The facility also features a public changing area with gender-neutral and fully accessible restrooms.

Swimming is allowed only when lifeguards are on duty. Programs offered at the pool include group and private swim lessons, recreational swim, and fitness swimming.

### Swim Capacity

Once the swim facility capacity is reached, there will be no new entries allowed for the remainder of the day, for the safety of the public. Please take this into consideration when planning your visit.

### Swim Lessons

Swim lessons offer by Life Guards are available at Roberts Pool Complex.
