The District mission is to acquire, preserve, protect, and operated regional parklands in perpetuity for public use, while conserving these lands for natural resources. As such the District performs routine park maintenance to maintain existing facilities and structures, improve watersheds and coastal shoreline conditions. The effects of these activities on wildlife are constantly monitored.
