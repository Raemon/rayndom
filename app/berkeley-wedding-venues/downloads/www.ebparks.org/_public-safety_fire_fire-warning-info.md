## The following Fire Danger restrictions remain in place for the remainder of fire season:

### 

Smoke-Free Parks

Smoking and electronic vaping are not allowed anywhere within the Regional Parks. They include smoking of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, use of vaping devices of tobacco or plant product. Secondhand smoke contains 70 cancer-causing toxins, and cigarettes found in the stomachs of birds and fishes have caused damage to wildlife, waterways, and ecosystems. Cigarettes are also a major cause of wildfires nation-wide.

### 

Restriction

No person shall build, light or maintain fires of any kind in areas where prohibited and posted during declared fire season. Extreme conditions may cause the elimination of all open flames for any purpose, or the evacuation or closure of a park.

### 

Personal Cooking Appliances

Personal appliances such as gas or propane camp stove, portable barbecue or hibachi may be used under the following conditions: (I)

  * Placement in an area that will not scorch, burn or otherwise damage lawns or table tops.
  * Placement in an area at least 30 feet from any flammable material such as grass, weeds, wood chips, brush or buildings.
  * All burning fuel such as wood or charcoal is thoroughly extinguished before being disposed of in an existing fireplace, fire pit or barbecue grill. It is unlawful to dispose of coals in garbage cans or refuse bins.
