The East Bay Regional Park District is governed by a seven-member Board of Directors. Each Director represents a specific geographic area of the District known as a ward. The District itself comprises all of Alameda and Contra Costa counties. Directors are publicly elected to serve four-year terms with elections staggered every two years in November; three terms expire in one even-numbered year and four terms expire the following even-numbered year. All elections and nominations of candidates for Directors will be held and conducted in accordance with the general election laws of the State. Candidates must be residents and electors of the wards from which they are nominated. Candidates should contact election officials in both counties ([Alameda County Registrar of Voters](http://www.acgov.org/rov) and [Contra Costa County Election Division](http://www.cocovote.us/)) for filing requirements, and refer to the District’s [Board Operating Guidelines](/sites/default/files/EBRPD-Board-Operating-Guidelines-20250114.pdf) for more election information.

For more information about the Park District Board of Directors, contact Kelly Clancy, Clerk of the Board, at 1-888-EBPARKS (1-888-327-2757), extension 2020.
