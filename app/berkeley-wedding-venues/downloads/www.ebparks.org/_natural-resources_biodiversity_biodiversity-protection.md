## Protecting Wildlife

The rich diversity of birds, mammals, reptiles, and invertebrates found throughout East Bay Regional Parks plays a vital role in the ecology of the San Francisco Bay Area and is an essential natural feature that visitors greatly enjoy. 

The Park District is responsible for protecting all native wildlife within the parks, including species that are state- and federally- listed as rare, threatened, or endangered. 

Certain human-caused actions can disrupt a healthy ecosystem and actually harm animals. This webpage is intended to educate the public about these impacts and explain what behaviors to avoid in order to help protect wildlife and preserve the parks’ natural balance.

### Do Not Feed Wildlife

Feeding wildlife may seem harmless or even compassionate, but it can cause serious harm to animals, people, and ecosystems. Wild animals have evolved to find and rely on natural food sources that meet their nutritional needs. Human food is often unhealthy for wildlife. Even foods that seem natural, such as bread or fruit, can disrupt an animal’s diet and long-term health. 

**Habituation:** Wildlife become conditioned to seeing people as a food source. They may lose their natural wariness of humans or become aggressive if they don’t get the food they expect. Increased presence, proximity, or aggression created by habituation sometimes leads people to view certain species (e.g., coyotes, raccoons, ground squirrels) as pests. 

**Fed Wildlife is Dead Wildlife:** When habituated to being fed by humans, animals may cease foraging or hunting for their own food and lose the natural skills they need to survive. They may also approach humans and dogs, putting them in dangerous situations. If their numbers and presence increase, wildlife may be viewed as pests, causing people to engage control measures. 

**Sharing Food = Sharing Diseases:** Wildlife that eat human food may suffer human diseases. For example, raccoons with easy access to human food have developed diabetes. Humans, wildlife, and pets can also all spread diseases to each other when in unnaturally close proximity, such as avian influenza, leptospirosis, and distemper. 

**Bite Risks:** Wild animals can carry diseases, including rabies. Attempting to hand-feed an animal can invite a bite—intended or not. 

**Leave No Trace:** This principle teaches people to leave nature just as we found it. If you’ve brought food with you to enjoy on a break during a hike, it belongs in your belly or returned to your backpack when you depart. Do not leave scraps or wrappers behind. 

**Feeding Wildlife is Illegal:** For all the reasons mentioned above, the [Park District’s Ordinance 38](https://library.municode.com/ca/east_bay_regional_park_district/codes/ordinance_38_-_rules_and_regulations?nodeId=CHVIIIPAFERO_S803FEREI) forbids feeding of wildlife. Violators are subject to citation. Read section 803.





### Cats in Regional Parks

Free-roaming cats are a familiar sight across the East Bay, including within Regional Parks. While many cats are born outdoors, some began as house pets and were abandoned or lost and have adapted to living independently. Unfortunately, these cats can pose serious challenges for native wildlife. Cats are natural hunters and prey upon sensitive bird and small-mammal species in the parks. [Learn more](/natural-resources/biodiversity/cats-in-regional-parks) about how the Park District manages domestic cats living in Regional Parks.
