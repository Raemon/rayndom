## Key Advocacy Goal

To seek funding and partnerships which address sea-level rise with nature-based infrastructure and mitigation strategies regarding climate change.

A central goal for the Park District is monitoring the effects of climate change on District resources and utilize adaptive management techniques to adjust stewardship methods and priorities to preserve the natural, cultural, and scenic values of the parks and trails

## Survey Identified Voter/Community Support

  * In a November 2021 survey, 92% of respondents identified nature-based flood and sea-level rise protection along the Bay and Delta shorelines to be extremely/very/somewhat important.
  * In a May 2021 survey, 63% of respondents found nature-based flood and sea-level rise protection along the Bay and Delta shorelines to be extremely / very important.
  * 70% identified investment in improving the health of lakes in District parks to be extremely / very important.
  * The East Bay Regional Park District is part of the solution to climate change. Sea - level rise is threatening shoreline parks, trails, and communities, many lakes are suffering from toxic algae blooms, and the prolonged drought has had severe impacts on forests and woodlands. To ensure the East Bay’s resilience to a changing climate, nature - based solutions are required.” In a November 2021 survey, **70% of respondents** found this argument for increased climate investments convincing.
