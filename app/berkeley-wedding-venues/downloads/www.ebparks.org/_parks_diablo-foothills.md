Diablo Foothills is an imposing gateway to the beautiful parklands of Mt Diablo State Park and Walnut Creek Open Space. The Foothills 1,060 acres are valued for their striking geologic formations, their sweeping panoramas of the San Francisco Bay Region and the rural quality of the adjacent rolling grasslands. 

Adjacent to Diablo Foothills is [Castle Rock Recreation Area](/parks/castle-rock) located in a scenic canyon along Pine Creek. The area is dominated by oak woodlands and prominent sandstone formations. Castle Rock has historically specialized in preparing picnic events for large groups of 300 or more people.

### Annual Closure Notice

The rock formations in Pine Canyon are currently closed effective February 1, reopening August 1, to protect nesting peregrine falcons. This protected species is highly territorial and sensitive to disturbance, especially during nesting season. Although the rock formations, known as Castle Rock, are in Mt. Diablo State Park, most visitors reach them through Diablo Foothills Regional Park. No other portions of the park are affected. We appreciate the public’s cooperation in helping us protect these species birds. For further information, please contact park staff at [(510) 544-3085](tel:1-510-544-3085).

## Park Accessibility

The pathways within Castle Rock Recreation Area are wheelchair accessible. Other wheelchair accessible facilities in Castle Rock Recreation Area include a restroom and a drinking fountain, and an accessible lift into the pool.

## Attractions

Besides panoramic views of the mountain and its surroundings, Diablo Foothills' 1,060 acres contain interesting geologic features, beautiful wildflowers in season, and a variety of bird and animal life.

Vegetation varies from grassland and oak savannah on the hills to riparian and oak woodland in the valley. Pine Creek flows through Pine Canyon and is within the eastern portion of the Walnut Creek watershed, which drains 150 square miles of central Contra Costa County into San Francisco Bay.

Diverse habitat types support an equally diverse array of wildlife, including mule deer, bobcats, coyote, grey fox, long-tailed weasels, raccoons, gophers, rabbits and ground squirrels. Birds such as red-winged blackbirds, northern mockingbirds, scrub jay, California quail, and brown towhees use the park for nesting and foraging habitat. Rock outcrops shelter garter and gopher snakes, western fence lizards, southern alligator lizards, tree frogs, and California salamanders. The perennial pools of water in Pine Creek ensure the survival of green sunfish, mosquitofish and largemouth bass.

### Park Activities

Diablo Foothills offers abundant open land for horseback riding, hiking, bicycling and nature study. 

Within Diablo Foothills Regional Park is the [Castle Rock Recreation Area](/parks/castle-rock) which is located in a scenic canyon along Pine Creek.

### Picnicking 

The park has reservable group picnic areas, view our [Castle Rock & Diablo Foothills Picnic Areas](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/picnics/castle-rock-diablo-foothills-picnic-areas) webpage for more information, and call Reservations to reserve. Other picnic sites are available on a first-come, first-serve basis.

### Swimming

The Castle Rock Pool Complex features a 30 feet by 70 feet swimming pool and deck areas. In addition, the complex is fully accessible to individuals with disabilities, including the bathhouse and an accessible lift into the pool. (Pool access fee to enter swim area.) Swimming is allowed only when lifeguards are on duty. For current hours of operation and lifeguard service schedule, visit the [Castle Rock Swim Facilities](https://www.ebparks.org/recreation/swimming/castle-rock) page.

**Swim Facilities Capacity Notice**  
Once the swim facility capacity is reached, there will be no new entries allowed for the remainder of the day (or at the discretion of the Park Supervisor), for the safety of the public. Please take this into consideration when planning your visit.
