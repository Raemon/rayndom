Trail Closure Notice

**Lake Trail** is **closed** due to terrain damage.  
The section of Lake View Trail below Stanley Blvd is now open. The lower connector trail from the bridge at North Beach that extends up to Lake View Trail will remain closed until storm damage is repaired. Updated January 23, 2026.

A haven for swimming and fishing can be found at Shadow Cliffs, only a mile from downtown Pleasanton on Stanley Boulevard.

Shadow Cliffs, formerly a gravel quarry, was donated to the Park District by Kaiser Industries and opened as a park in 1971. Its assessed value of $250,000 was used to obtain a matching grant for development of the park from the U.S. Bureau of Outdoor Recreation.

With this start, the Park District has developed a 266-acre park including an 80-acre lake and ample parking and picnic grounds. There are facilities for persons with disabilities.

Besides the main lake, Shadow Cliffs has an arroyo with a chain of smaller lakes and ponds. Check signage for latest water quality conditions. No swimming or boating is allowed here; the shady areas and quiet waters make for a peaceful retreat on hot summer days. 

In 2017, solar panels were installed at Shadow Cliffs. The project includes solar panels that generate 1.2 megawatts of energy annually – enough to offset electricity use for almost the entire Park District – along with three electric-car charging stations, a recycled water line, and planting of native trees. This solar carport system also provides much-needed shade for the parking lots at Shadow Cliffs.
