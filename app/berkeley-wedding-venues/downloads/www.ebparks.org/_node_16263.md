![Co-op Tent Setup](/sites/default/files/styles/original_800w_/public/CO_OP_%242712_Tent_Setup.jpg?itok=gqUMYs_P)

**The Community Outreach-Outdoor Programs (CO-OP)** is a Summer partnership with local non-profit organizations during the months of **July, August, and September**. Our goal is to equip, educate, and empower partners to independently lead overnight recreation activities in their beautiful parks. Partners can choose between either an overnight car camping or an introductory backpacking trip. We provide campsite reservations, buses, food, equipment, and recreation staff to facilitate various activities (such as hiking, fishing, field games, environmental education, and more!); as well as an information night for partner staff and participants. Partners must commit to recruiting participants, helping plan activities, promoting trips, completing paperwork, and supervising campers. This program is supported by the Regional Parks Foundation and focuses on communities that face access, transportation, or other barriers to outdoor recreation in their EBRPD parks.

If you are interested in applying, please email/print out and mail in the [CO-OP-Partner-Application.PDF](/sites/default/files/CO-OP-Partner-Application-2026-Final.pdf) or contact the Recreation Coordinator Morgan Evans, [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#14797162757a675471766475667f673a7b6673), or at 1 (510) 544-2566 for more information.
