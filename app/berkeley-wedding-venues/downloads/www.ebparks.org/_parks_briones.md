Damaged Trail

The intersection of Briones Crest Trail/ Mott Peak Trail and Briones Crest Trail/ Lagoon Trail at **Briones Regional Park** is currently damaged but passable with care. Barricades and cones have been posted on both ends of the fire trail to warn park users. Please follow all signage and use caution. Updated January 23, 2026.

### Briones Special Management Area

The Briones Special Management Area is a 1,600 acre zone in the northeast part of Briones Regional Park that employs a variety of trail management strategies to protect habitat, wildlife, and watersheds. The Special Management Area establishes specific rules limiting trail use, such as hiking only, biking only, or hiking/biking only and direction of travel. On weekends, trail use within the Special Management Area will alternate between bicycle and equestrian use based on even and odd calendar days ([see table](/parks/briones/briones-special-management-area#Schedule)).

The Special Management Area was tested during the Briones Pilot Project. The Briones Pilot Project was a 20 month pilot (from April 21, 2023 – December 17, 2024) that established specific rules limiting trail use within the Pilot Project Zone and for two trail segments adjacent to the Pilot Project Zone, such as hiking only, biking only, or biking/hiking only and direction of travel. On weekends, trail use within the Pilot Project Zone alternated between bicycle and equestrian use based on even and odd calendar dates ([see table](/parks/briones/briones-special-management-area#Schedule)). A key component of the Project was the restoration of illegally built “bootleg” trails to protect natural habitat for wildlife.

For more information, visit the [Briones Special Management Area](/parks/briones/briones-special-management-area) page.

### Dog Requirements

**PLEASE NOTE** : Dogs are **required** to be on leash (six-foot maximum) at all times in the following areas: Tavan Trail (all), Diablo View Trail between Alhambra Creek Trail and Hidden Pond Trail, Alhambra Creek Trail from the Alhambra Creek Staging Area south to the water trough, and Orchard Trail between Alhambra Creek Trail and west to the Briones Road gate. These leash-required areas are indicated by signage within the park.

## Attractions

Briones' 6,255 acres are home to many animals and birds, which forage on the grasslands or find shelter among the oaks and bays. You may see black-tailed deer, coyotes, squirrels, red-tailed hawks, turkey vultures, and if you are lucky, other more reclusive creatures. There are gorgeous wildflower displays in season. Park District naturalists often lead walks to view the park's natural and historic features.

Briones is an ideal park for hiking, running, biking, and horseback riding over the park's scenic trails; picnicking, birdwatching, and similar activities; and informal recreation such as kite flying, photography, and nature study. There are five major access points, of which the two most developed are the Alhambra Creek Valley Staging Area off Reliez Valley Road near Martinez and the Bear Creek Road Staging Area near Orinda and Lafayette.

### Group Camping

Briones Regional Park features three group campsites ranging in capacity from 50 to 300 campers, reservations required (a minimum of 17 people is required to use the group campsites). All group campsites include picnic tables, BBQ, fire ring, and chemical toilets. View the [Camping page](/recreation/camping) for more information, and call Reservations to reserve.

### Archery Range

The Briones Archers archery range is accessible off the Crescent Ridge Trail from Briones' west-side Bear Creek Road entrance. Website: [BrionesArchery.org](http://www.brionesarchery.org/ "BrionesArchery.org")

### Picnicking

The park also has reservable group picnic areas, view our [Briones Picnic Areas](/recreation/picnics/briones-picnic-areas) webpage for information, and call Reservations to reserve.

### Grazing

Cows and calves are in the Tabletop, Spengler, Blue Oak, Buckeye, Sunrise, and Lafayette Ridge trail areas. Yearling cattle are in Deer Creek, Pereirra , Valley, and Briones Crest trail areas. Please call the park if you have trail or grazing animal concerns or comments: [1-888-327-2757](tel:1-888-327-2757), option 3, ext. 4508.
