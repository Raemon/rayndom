Area Closure Notice - On-Going Soil Delivery and Grading Work

This project is part of the Park District’s ongoing efforts to build up the topography of the park to meet the standards of the District’s Oyster Bay Land Use Plan Amendment adopted in 2013. [More information](https://ebparks.org/projects/oyster-bay-land-use-plan-amendment).

An astonishing diversity of wildlife can be seen at this shoreline park under development just south of Oakland International Airport. Marsh hawks, black-shouldered kites, red-tailed hawks, and shorebirds abound. Views of the Bay are spectacular.

## Park Accessibility

**Accessibility Resources**  
Access Northern California, in partnership with BORP, provides information related to accessibility at Oyster Bay Regional Shoreline. [Access Northern California Oyster Bay Regional Shoreline Accessibility Page](https://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=152)  
 _(Disclaimer: The Park District has not reviewed and does not guarantee the accuracy of the information provided by Access Northern California Accessibility.)_

## Attractions

Seven group picnic areas (non-reservable) are nestled among the tree berms and newly planted turf along the multipurpose trails. These interior trails lead to a view site topped by Roger Berry's sculpture titled "Rising Wave." The perimeter trail affords sweeping Bay vistas. The two-mile Bay Trail around the perimeter is paved from the Neptune entrance to the “Bill Lockyer Bridge.” Toilet facilities are located by the picnic area and new lawn area.

Some new amenities include a quarter-acre garden with 300 plants that flower from fall through winter, providing overwintering Monarchs with nectar to help them survive the winter and migrate in the spring and an 18-hole disc golf course. The Oyster Bay disc golf course is free to play and is located beyond the rising wave sculpture, for more information, go to <https://www.obdgc.org/>.
