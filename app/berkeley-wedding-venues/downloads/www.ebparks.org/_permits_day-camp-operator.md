# Summer Day Camp Operator Permit

__Back to top

**All** day camps (for-profit, non-profit, and public agency) must have a permit in order to operate in the East Bay Regional Park District. The Summer Day Camp Operator Permit is offered for programs starting and ending between **June 1** and **August 31**.

Camps or other educational/childcare programs operating outside of those months (September 1 – May 31) require an [Outdoor Program Permit](/permits/outdoor-program) or [Special Event Permit](/permits/special-event).

Occasional field trips typically don’t require a permit. Please email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#44362137342136292d300421263425362f376a2b3623) with any questions.
