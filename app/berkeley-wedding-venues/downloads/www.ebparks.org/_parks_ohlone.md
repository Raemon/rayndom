## Attractions

The region is home to very few people, but it shelters abundant wildlife. Creatures not often seen near metropolitan areas live in these lands, including the endangered bald eagle, mountain lions, bobcats, deer, and a herd of Tule Elk.

The landscape includes oak and bay woodlands, grassy uplands carpeted with springtime wildflowers, and wilderness ridges and peaks.

### Hiking and Horseback Riding

The remote and beautiful wilderness areas of the Ohlone Wilderness are accessible only through the Ohlone Wilderness Trail. The Ohlone Trail traverses 28 miles of mountains and canyons in southern Alameda County and is open to hikers and equestrians. Trail bicycles and motor vehicles are not permitted.

The Ohlone Trail passes through the Ohlone Wilderness and three regional parks: Mission Peak Regional Preserve in Fremont, Sunol Regional Wilderness near Pleasanton and south of Sunol, and Del Valle Regional Park. It also passes through two watershed areas leased from the San Francisco Water Department.

It is very important to stay on the trail corridor in these leased areas and obey directional signs along the way. Trespassing off-trail into non-leased water department lands may result in citation and may jeopardize future public use of the leased lands.

### Ohlone Wilderness Regional Trail Hiking Permit

*** **As of 1/1/2026** , an Ohlone permit will NOT be required and no additional permits will be sold. No refunds for permits purchased in 2025. Backpacking reservations are still required if you plan on staying overnight. ***

  
[Download the Ohlone Wilderness Regional Trail Hiking Map (PDF)](/sites/default/files/Ohlone-Wilderness-Permit-Map-11x17.pdf?linkLoc=OhloneWildernessPage).

### Camping

A separate camping reservation is required if you plan on staying overnight at one of the designated campsites along the Ohlone Wilderness Trail. Camping reservations must be made at least TWO days in advance by calling the Reservations Department.

Overnight parking, with a reservation and permit, is allowed in the Del Valle, Sunol, and Mission Peak parking lots. Please visit our [Camping page](/recreation/camping) for additional information.

### Current Water Availability

Backpack water comes from natural springs and may not be available.  
**All water is non-potable** (filter, treat, or boil for human consumption).

  * Boyd Camp (Ohlone Wilderness)
  * Doe Canyon Horse Camp (Ohlone Wilderness)
