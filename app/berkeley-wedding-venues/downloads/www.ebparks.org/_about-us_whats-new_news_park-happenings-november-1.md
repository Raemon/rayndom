Please feel free to use excerpts. Photos available at [bit.ly/ParkHappeningsforNov2025](https://bit.ly/ParkHappeningsforNov2025)

**🆓****Green Friday Free Park Day.** Celebrate Green Friday — the day after Thanksgiving — with a free park day in East Bay Regional Parks! Fees are waived for parking, boat launching, and fishing — only state fishing licenses, watercraft inspections, and concession fees apply. Admission to Ardenwood Historic Farm is also waived for Green Friday! The East Bay Regional Park District celebrates Green Friday to encourage the public to spend time in nature. It’s a great way to spend time with family and friends the day after Thanksgiving. 

Green Friday programs include:

  * **Green Friday Hike,** 9 a.m. at Black Diamond Mines (Drop-in)
  * **Green Friday Hike Amongst the Trees,** 9 a.m. at Reinhardt Redwood (Drop-in)
  * **Green Friday Gratitude Hike,** 10 a.m. at Sunol (Drop-in)
  * **Green Friday Hike,** 10:30 a.m. at Coyote Hills (Drop-in)
  * **Turkey Talk,** 12:30 p.m. at Black Diamond Mines (Drop-in)
  * **Green Friday Volunteer Opportunities** , 9 a.m. at Contra Loma and Quarry Lakes (Registration required)



The Park District is also facilitating **cleanup projects on Green Friday**. Instead of (or after!) spending the day searching for special savings on holiday gifts, use the day off to give back to nature through a service project. The Park District is facilitating two clean-up events for all to join: At both **Contra Loma Regional Park** in Antioch and **Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area** in Fremont, volunteers will be removing invasive plants at designated worksites between 9 a.m. and noon. Registration required.

  * **Age Restrictions:** Youth under the age of 18 must have a signed permission by parent or legal guardian. Youth under the age of 13 must be accompanied by an adult.
  * **What to Bring:** Water bottle, gloves, and sun protection.
  * **What is Provided:** Necessary tools.
  * **Weather Notes:** Heavy rain or wildfire smoke cancels.

**Additional Veterans Benefits:**

🙌**Native American Heritage Month.** Celebrate Native American Heritage Month by recognizing and honoring the Indigenous peoples who have inhabited this land since time immemorial. Indigenous peoples and tribal citizens in the East Bay continue to be closely connected to the land through distinct traditions, unique languages, and sophisticated knowledge systems.

Individuals from the Ohlone, Bay Miwok, Delta Yokut, and many others, continue to live on this land, practicing their culture and traditions to this day. Immense gratitude is extended to the many Native peoples who have contributed — and continue to contribute — their perspectives, voices, history, and culture to our programs.

Learn more about the Park District’s Native American Heritage Month activities, programs, and stories at [ebparks.org/native-american-heritage-month](https://www.ebparks.org/native-american-heritage-month).
