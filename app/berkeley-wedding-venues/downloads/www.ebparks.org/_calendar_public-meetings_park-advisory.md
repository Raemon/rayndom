**NOTICE FOR ALL PUBLIC MEETINGS:** The East Bay Regional Park District (Park District) intends to hold meetings through a hybrid of in-person and virtual attendance (via phone/video conference) through the Park District’s virtual platform, Zoom. Members of the public may participate in-person at the Park District Headquarters (2950 Peralta Oaks Court, Oakland, California) or at other designated and noticed meeting locations, or remotely via Zoom. Members of the Park Advisory Committee may participate remotely when authorized by the Brown Act, as amended by AB 2449. For additional information, please refer to the public meeting agendas.

**Accommodations and Access:** Park District facilities and meetings comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. If special accommodations are needed for you to participate, please contact the Clerk of the Board at [(510) 544-2020](tel:1-510-544-2020) as soon as possible, but preferably at least three working days prior to the meeting.

### Park Advisory Committee (PAC) Meetings

The Park Advisory Committee (PAC) Meetings are on the fourth Monday of each month at 4:00 pm at the Park District Headquarters in Oakland, unless otherwise noted.

The Park Advisory Committee (PAC) is a 21-member community advisory group appointed by the Park District Board of Directors. Candidates are nominated by individual Board members and a variety of other public entities, such as the Mayors' Conference, Board of Supervisors, and Special District Chapters of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties.

The role of the East Bay Regional Park District Park Advisory Committee is to provide community perspectives and advice to staff and the Board on the issues, projects and policies of the Park District.

Members are appointed for a two-year term and may serve a total of four consecutive terms, or eight years. Service is voluntary and members receive no compensation. 

The PAC provides members with a great opportunity to learn more about the Park District. For additional information on becoming a PAC member, email [Park [email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b2e2d3c0d9f3d6c4dbc1ddc0cbf1dddfdfdbc6c6d7d7f2d7d0c2d3c0d9c19cddc0d5), or call [(510) 544-2036](tel:1-510-544-2036).
