# Climate-Friendly Transportation

__Back to top

## Key Advocacy Goal

To expand accessible active and public transportation in East Bay parks and trails.

  * Improve access to and use of the parks by members of groups that are underrepresented, such as persons with disabilities, the economically disadvantaged and elderly park visitors.
  * Provide recreational development that fosters appropriate use of parklands while preserving their remoteness and intrinsic value.
  * Balance environmental concerns and outdoor recreational opportunities within regional parklands.



## Survey Identified Voter/Community Support

  * In a December 2020 survey, 64% of respondents identified providing regional trail connectivity for commuters and safe routes to school to be important.
  * In a May 2021 survey, 64% of respondents found infrastructure repair and upgrades of existing visitor use facilities, including new restrooms, water bottle filling and hand washing stations to be extremely / very important.
