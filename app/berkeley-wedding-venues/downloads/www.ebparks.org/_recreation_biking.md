For the biking enthusiast, the East Bay Regional Park District has everything from [paved flat paths](/trails/paved-regional-trails) passing by schools, business and shopping centers, parks and other recreation areas to [remote backcountry trails](/trails/mountain-bike) for more advanced mountain bikers. Many of the East Bay Regional Park District's 1,330 miles of trails are open to bikes. Bikes are allowed on most multi-use (wide) trails and prohibited on most narrow trails. See [Bicycle Loop Brochures](/trails/bicycle-loop-trails).

### Biking Programs

The Outdoor Recreation Department provides public biking programs touring our beautiful parks and trails in a fun group setting. Join Recreation staff on a weekend ride and learn basic bike maintenance, bike safety, and safe group riding skills. Some rides include a naturalist. [Register for one of our public programs](https://apm.activecommunities.com/ebparks/Activity_Search?txtActivitySearch=biking&applyFiltersDefaultValue=true&cat=Activities).

### Biking Field Trips

The Outdoor Recreation Department provides affordable biking field trips for schools and community organizations. Our knowledgeable and engaging Recreation staff provide the bikes, helmets, and gear. They meet your group at the park, and provide a safe and organized trip through our beautiful Regional Parks and Trails. These trips are on paved and relatively flat trails and some roads. Trips can range from 1.5 to 3 hours; costs vary, depending on group size and duration. Participants must be at least 5' tall and know how to ride a bike. We can accommodate up to 20 total riders. However, we can accommodate larger groups if we split into two rotations. [More information and to apply for Field Trips](/programs/outdoor-recreation#field-trip).

For Biking field trips, contact (510) 544-2559 or [[email protected].](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ef8e8486819baf8a8d9f8e9d849cc1809d88)

[The Park District maintains good working relationships with the ](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5f3e3436312b1f3a3d2f3e2d342c71302d38)[Bicycle Trails Council East Bay](http://www.btceb.org/ "Click here to visit Bicycle Trails Council East Bay's website, opens a new browser window") (BTCEB), and the [East Bay Bicycle Coalition](http://www.ebbc.org/ "Click here to visit East Bay Bicycle Coalition's website, opens a new browser window"). Our volunteer trail safety patrol has a [bicycle division](http://parkpatrol.org/vbp/index.htm "Click here to visit Volunteer Bicycle Patrol's website, opens a new browser window") that promotes [safe and responsible riding](/safety/biking). When planning a bike route, be sure to do a little research. [Some parks do not allow bikes](/safety/biking/no-biking-areas) or have limited access and some routes can be extremely challenging. Also, not all trails or trailheads have water, so come prepared. For guidance, be sure to check out our [Paved Trails Section](/trails/paved-regional-trails) and [Mountain Bike Trail Best Picks](/trails/mountain-bike). Each park brochure has a trail map that shows where biking is permitted. Visit [511.org Bicycling](http://bicycling.511.org/ "511.org Bicycling Resources") for bicycling trip planning, and transit resources.

### e-bikes

In September 2023, the Park District Board of Directors voted to allow Class 1 e-bikes on all trails where regular bikes are allowed, and Class 2 e-bikes on all paved Regional Trails. Class 1 e-bikes are pedal-assist and require pedaling for assistance from the electric motor. Class 2 e-bikes have a throttle and allow pedal assist but do not require pedaling for assistance from the electric motor. Class 3 e-bikes and e-scooters are NOT permitted in East Bay Regional Parks and Regional Trails.

**Safety Reminders**  
Enjoying your e-bike? Awesome! Remember to keep trails safe for all:

  * Slow down! It’s 15 mph max. Slow to 5 mph when passing other trail users.
  * Helmet on. Protect your head. And it’s the law for riders under age 18.
  * Stay on designated trails. Wildlife and plants appreciate it.

### Data Tracking and Legislative Update

Please review the [E-bike Data Report Memo](/sites/default/files/e-bike-Memo-Jan2025.pdf "E-Bike Data Report").
