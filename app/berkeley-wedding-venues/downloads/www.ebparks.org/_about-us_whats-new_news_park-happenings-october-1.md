News from the East Bay Regional Park District

September 30, 2025

 _(Please feel free to use excerpts. Photos available at[ bit.ly/ParkHappeningsOctober2025](https://bit.ly/ParkHappeningsOctober2025))_

**🔥****When Leaves Fall, Fire Risks Rise.** Fall is peak fire season, due to dried-out vegetation from summer heat and offshore Diablo winds that historically occur September through November. Be aware of fire hazards, restrictions, and Red Flag Warnings. Wildfire safety remains one of the East Bay Regional Park District's top priorities.

Fire Safety Tips

  * Follow all fire safety rules.
  * No smoking or vaping in parks.
  * No fireworks.
  * Report fire hazards and call 911 if you see an active fire.

**🚒****667-Acre Fuels Reduction Project Complete.** For the past three years, the East Bay Regional Park District has been thinning brush and hazardous trees on 667 acres at Anthony Chabot Regional Park to reduce fire risk. This groundbreaking effort — the first of its kind in California — included large-scale eucalyptus removal and the use of a climate-friendly carbonizer to dispose of debris with minimal emissions. Reducing fire fuels is essential to slowing wildfires and giving firefighters time to stop them before they grow out of control.

For more information, visit [ebparks.org/news](https://www.ebparks.org/news).

**🐦‍⬛‍****Fall Is a Great Time for Birding.** Fall and winter are prime seasons for birding in East Bay Regional Parks. From wetlands to woodlands, diverse habitats host migrating and nesting birds, as well as wintering waterfowl and shorebirds. It’s a perfect time to spot unique species and enjoy this beloved outdoor pastime.

The Park District offers birding programs for all experience levels, including hikes, kayak excursions, and community science events. Birdwatching is more accessible than ever with events like the Great Backyard Bird Count (Feb. 13-16, 2026) and apps like Merlin and eBird. For information, visit [ebparks.org/calendar](https://www.ebparks.org/calendar) and search “Birding.”

💖**Looking for Love.** With the onset of cooler fall weather, male tarantulas leave their burrows to find females. They tap on the burrow entrance to signal a mate, and if she emerges, they mate. Life isn’t easy for male tarantulas. After mating, the female can sometimes kill the male, though this is infrequent. Even if he survives, he will soon die. Male tarantulas only live for seven to 10 years, while females can live as long as 30 years. 

Tarantulas in the East Bay range from dark brown to light tan and are spotted most often in the late afternoon or early evening, after the day’s heat fades. Join a naturalist program or hike to learn more about these fuzzy friends — or possibly even see one. For more information, visit [ebparks.org/calendar](https://www.ebparks.org/calendar) and search “Tarantulas.”

**🌽****Celebrate Corn at Ardenwood’s Harvest Festival!** The story of corn begins with a wild grass called teosinte, first cultivated in central Mexico around 9,000 years ago. Today, corn — also known as maize — nourishes communities around the globe. From popcorn and cornbread to polenta, hominy, cereal, and of course, corn on the cob, many popular foods trace back to this remarkable plant. 

To learn more about corn, attend Ardenwood’s annual Harvest Festival on Oct. 11-12, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., where visitors can walk through the cornﬁelds and participate in the ancient autumn ritual of harvesting maize — and even take home a few ears of corn (one-bag-per-person limit). Enjoy seasonal activities, including cider pressing, live music, and historic crafts, and ride a narrow-gauge train. Free for participants ages 3 and under.

For more information, visit [ebparks.org/calendar](https://www.ebparks.org/calendar) and search “Harvest Festival.”

🕰️**Step Back in Time at the Sunol Heritage Festival.** Celebrate the rich heritage of the Sunol wilderness at a lively, family-friendly festival on Saturday, Oct. 18, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., filled with hands-on history, live music, crafts, Ohlone stories, and fun for all ages. Visitors can connect with the past through activities that highlight the history, traditions, and cultures of the region — from crafting miniature tule boats, to making traditional pine nut bracelets and learning about ranching brands while creating a “branded” bandana.

Families can also try their hands at old-time laundry, play Ohlone and Victorian-era games, meet Poppy the wooden milking cow, practice lasso skills, and more. Guests are encouraged to bring a picnic and enjoy the park’s natural setting while taking part in the festivities. Parking is $5.

For more information, visit [www.ebparks.org/sunol-heritage-festival](https://www.ebparks.org/sunol-heritage-festival).

**🎃****Ardenwood Halloween Festivities.** Each year Ardenwood comes alive in October with the frightful Haunted Railroad and community pumpkin patch. Ardenwood offers nighttime train rides through its haunted forest. The ride is spooky — not scary — and is designed especially for children under 12. Tickets sell out fast! Registration required. For more information, visit [spcrr.org](http://www.spcrr.org).

Ardenwood’s annual pumpkin patch is operated by Dig Deep Farms, which also offers Halloween-themed arts, crafts, and games. Pumpkin patch admission does not include admission to Ardenwood Historic Farm.

For more information, visit [ebparks.org/calendar](https://www.ebparks.org/calendar) and search “Pumpkin Patch.”
