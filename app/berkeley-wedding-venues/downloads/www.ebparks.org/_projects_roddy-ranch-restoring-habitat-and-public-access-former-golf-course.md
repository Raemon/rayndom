## Overview

The East Bay Regional Park District, in partnership with the East Contra Costa County Habitat Conservancy, is developing a new Regional Park in Antioch! 

Deer Valley Regional Park includes the former 18-hole Roddy Ranch Golf Course located off Deer Valley Road. In 2022, the Park District adopted a Habitat Restoration and Public Access Plan to restore native grasslands across the 230-acre golf course and provide facilities for passive recreation including walking, biking, horseback riding, and picnicking. This parkland is part of the Conservancy’s Preserve System, which emphasizes environmental restoration and preservation. 

The next phase of Park development includes:

  * Restoring 84 acres of grasslands
  * Installing picnic areas, restrooms, and nearly four miles of multi-use trails
  * Building an interpretive pavilion for environmental education and history



Construction is anticipated to begin in 2026, pending permit approvals and funding.

## History

Eastern Contra Costa County is home to Native peoples who have stewarded the landscape for centuries. Bay Miwok-speaking tribes like the Julpun, Ompin, and Volvon thrived until Spanish contact in the late 1700s. Today, their descendants cherish the East Bay as ancestral land. 

In the 19th century, American pioneer John Marsh purchased Rancho de Los Meganos, a vast 13,000-acre cattle ranch that shaped modern Brentwood. Nearby coal discoveries in the 1850s led to the rise and fall of mining towns, while the Brentwood Oil Field brought mid-20th-century industry.

In the 1970s, rodeo star and rancher Jack Roddy transformed the area again, initially for cattle, later founding Roddy Ranch Golf Course in 2000. After 16 years of serving the community, the course became part of Deer Valley Regional Park.

## HCP/NCCP 

Adopted in 2007, the East Contra Costa County Habitat Conservation Plan & Natural Community Conservation Plan (HCP/NCCP) establishes a science-based conservation strategy for east Contra Costa County. This allows the Conservancy and agencies like the Park District to secure funding to purchase and protect habitat.

Information about the HCP/NCCP, including allowed recreational uses (see Chapter 5, Conservation Strategy), can be found on the [**East Contra Costa County Habitat Conservancy**](https://www.cocohcp.org/221/Final-HCP-NCCP%60) website.
