Boil Water Advisory

**NOTICE TO VISITORS OF PIEDMONT STABLES** : The drinking water system serving Piedmont Stables is currently under a Boil Water Advisory. For more information please refer to: [Piedmont Stables Water System Boil Water Notice (PDF)](/sites/default/files/boil_water_notice_RD_Final_Mar2025.pdf). Updated January 23, 2026.

Dr. Aurelia Reinhardt Redwood Regional Park is a hidden gem of redwood forest off Redwood Road, just a few miles over the ridge from downtown Oakland. The forest's peaceful groves give little evidence of the park's bustling past. In the mid-1800s the area was the scene of extensive logging to supply building materials for the San Francisco Bay Area. The logging era has long since passed, and a stately forest of 150-foot coast redwoods (_Sequoia sempervirens_) has replaced those cut down.

In 2019, the park was [renamed ](/about-us/whats-new/news/redwood-regional-park-renamed-after-first-female-park-district-board-member)in honor of Dr. Aurelia Henry Reinhardt, president of Mills College. Dr. Reinhardt was one of five prominent civic leaders elected to the Park District’s first Board of Directors in 1934.




## To Reach The Park

### 

Entrances

[Redwood Road Park Entrance (Get directions; opens in a new window)](https://www.google.com/maps?q=37.800358, -122.145175) 🗗

There are several entrances to Reinhardt Redwood Regional Park. The main entrance, Redwood Gate, is on Redwood Road in Oakland about two miles east of Skyline Blvd. In Oakland on Highway 13, take the Redwood Road exit and go east (uphill). At the top of the hill you will cross Skyline Boulevard and pass the Skyline Ranch Equestrian Center on the right. Farther along you will pass Piedmont Stables on the left. Big Bear Staging Area will be on the right about one and one-half miles from Skyline Boulevard, followed by MacDonald Staging Area on the right and Redwood Gate on the left (seasonal parking fee). If you continue another quarter mile and turn left at Pinehurst Road, you will reach Pinehurst Gate Staging Area after a few moments.

[Skyline Blvd Park Entrance (Roberts) (Get directions; opens in a new window)](https://www.google.com/maps?q=37.8128918712904,-122.175712696284) 🗗

Other staging areas may be reached by turning left onto Skyline Boulevard at its intersection with Redwood as you come uphill from Highway 13. You will first reach the 11500 Skyline Boulevard staging area on the right (the former administrative headquarters). Immediately past that, turn right to remain on Skyline Boulevard (otherwise the roadway becomes Joaquin Miller Road and you will proceed downhill). A few miles farther on Skyline you will reach Roberts Regional Recreation Area with a swimming pool, hiking, picnicking, etc. Farther along on Skyline you will reach Robert's Redwood Bowl, Moon Gate Staging Area, and the larger Skyline Gate Staging Area. Continuing on Skyline will bring you to Huckleberry Botanic and Sibley Volcanic Regional Preserves.

## Park Accessibility

**Accessibility Resources**  
Access Northern California, in partnership with BORP, provides information related to accessibility at Reinhardt Redwood Regional Park. [Access Northern California Reinhardt Redwood Regional Park Accessibility Page](https://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=100)  
 _(Disclaimer: The Park District has not reviewed and does not guarantee the accuracy of the information provided by Access Northern California Accessibility.)_

## Attractions

This 1,833-acre park is home to a great forest of coast redwoods as well as evergreens, chaparral, and grasslands. Wildlife within the park includes rare species such as the golden eagle and Alameda striped racer. Deer, raccoons, rabbits, and squirrels are often seen.

The naming of the rainbow trout species was based on fish taken from the San Leandro Creek drainage, which includes Redwood Creek. Trout seen in the creek today are descendants of that pure strain. Historical Landmark #970 is located at the fishway interpretive site a short distance inside the park's Redwood Gate park entrance off Redwood Road. The fish-way was constructed at the creek in this area to help the trout reach their upstream spawning grounds. Please note that fishing is not allowed in the park.
