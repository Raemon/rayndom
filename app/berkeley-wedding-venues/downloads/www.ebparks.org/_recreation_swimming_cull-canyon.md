![Cull Canyon Swim Complex](/sites/default/files/styles/original_800w_/public/CullCanyon-SwimComplex-20190809.JPG?itok=dZPC0RaO)

Located in [Cull Canyon Regional Recreation Area](/parks/cull-canyon), the swim complex, including bathhouse, vending machines and lifeguard service, is open during the warm weather season. It is ideal for families with small children, who will enjoy splashing in the shallows and playing on the white, sandy beach of the chlorinated swim lagoon. Swimming is allowed only when lifeguards are on duty.

Several picnic tables and charcoal BBQs are available for use inside the swim area on a first-come, first-serve basis. No alcohol and no glass containers are allowed. No BBQs or stoves can be brought in. Check fire restrictions before you visit. Beach wheelchairs are available free of charge on a first-come, first-served basis.

**NOTE: No alcohol, glass containers, or portable bbq's allowed in the swim lagoon area**

**Swim Facilities Capacity Notice**  
Due to the popularity of swimming at Cull Canyon, the swim facility reaches capacity very early on weekends and Holidays. Once the swim facility capacity is reached, there will be no new entries allowed for the remainder of the day (or at the discretion of the Park Supervisor), for the safety of the public. Please take this into consideration when planning your visit.

**Dogs**  
Dogs are not allowed in the swim facility.
