## Overview

In August 2025, the East Bay Regional Park District acquired 82 acres within a larger area known as Point Molate, providing a unique opportunity to protect and support plants and wildlife, and to develop critical shoreline, open space and recreational access for the community. The long-term vision for a Regional Park at Point Molate will evolve over many years and will be shaped by public engagement, technical assessment, and exploration of funding strategies.

## Site Description

Point Molate is a 420-acre site on the west shore of the Point San Pablo Peninsula north of the Richmond-San Rafael bridge with breathtaking views along San Francisco Bay. The site holds remnant native grasslands, rare shoreline habitat, and a rich cultural history. In August 2025, the East Bay Regional Park District acquired 82 acres at Point Molate, funded by a grant from the California State Coastal Conservancy and the Park District’s voter-approved revenue measures AA and WW. The City of Richmond owns the remaining 338 acres.

The Point Molate Bay Trail Extension Project, a partnership between the Park District and the City of Richmond, is currently under construction and anticipated to open to the public in 2027. The project will create a new 2.5-mile segment of shoreline trail connecting the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge bike and pedestrian path to the City of Richmond’s Point Molate Beach Park and continue north to Point Molate and the Winehaven historic district. The trail will provide public access to the site which has been closed to the public for many years. The District will continue to partner with the City of Richmond over the next two years to ensure that the jointly owned shoreline areas are ready to receive visitors and host periodic public programs and events to celebrate this fascinating place.

## History

The history of Point Molate spans centuries. It was once home to native villages settled by the Huichin Ohlone and a historic Chinese fishing camp that operated from the 1860s to the early 1900s. ‘Winehaven’, once known as the world’s largest winery, operated here from the early 1900s until Prohibition ended production. Thirty-five structures remain from the Winehaven complex. The U.S. Navy occupied the site as a fuel depot from the 1940s until the 1990’s base closure. Today, remnant traces of these various enterprises can be discerned across the site, coexisting with osprey, eagles, and persistent natural habitat.
