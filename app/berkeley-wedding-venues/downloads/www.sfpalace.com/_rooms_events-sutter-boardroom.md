# Room set-up options

![Banquet Meeting Room Set Up](/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Banquet-Square-Arrangement.jpeg)

Banquet 

Generally used for meals and sessions involving small group discussions. A five foot round table seats eight people comfortably. A six foot round table seats 10 people comfortably. 

![Conference & Hollow Meeting Room Set Up](/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Conference-and-Hollow-Square-Arrangement.jpeg)

Conference and Hollow Square 

Appropriate for interactive discussions and note-taking sessions for fewer than 25 people. Many hotels have elegant "boardrooms" for 10 to 20 people, equipped with full audiovisual capabilities, a writing board, cork board and a flip chart. 

![E U T Shape Meeting Room Set Up](/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/E-U-T-Shape-Arrangement.jpeg)

E-Shape, U-Shape and T-Shape 

Appropriate for groups of fewer than 40 people. These are best for interaction with a leader seated at the head of the setup. Audiovisual is usually best set up at the open end of the seating. 

![Theater Meeting Room Set Up](/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Theater-Shape-Arrangement.jpeg)

Theater 

Appropriate for large sessions and short lectures that do not require extensive note-taking. This is a convenient setup to use before breaking into discussion or role-playing groups because chairs can be moved. 

![Reception Meeting Room Set Up](/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Reception-Arrangement.jpeg)

Reception 

Stand-up social function where beverages and light foods are served. Foods may be presented on small buffet tables or passed by servers. May precede a meal function. 

![Schoolroom Meeting Room Set Up](/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Schoolroom-Arrangement.jpeg)

Schoolroom or Classroom 

The most desirable setup for medium to large-size lectures. Requires a relatively large room. Tables provide attendees with space for spreading out materials and taking notes. 

![Ovals & Round Meeting Room Set Up](/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Oval-and-Round-Arrangement.jpeg)

Ovals and Rounds 

Generally used for meals and sessions involving small group discussions. A five foot round table seats eight people comfortably. A six foot round table seats 10 people comfortably.
