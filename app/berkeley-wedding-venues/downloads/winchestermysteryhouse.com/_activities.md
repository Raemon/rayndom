### VICTORIAN GARDENS

The gardens of Llanada Villa (now known as Winchester Mystery House®) have long been admired for their beauty and variety. Our landscaping team works to maintain many of Sarah’s original trees as well as over 10,000 box hedges and hundreds of varieties of tree and plant life. Step back into the 1900s with a stroll through the Winchester Estate’s Victorian Garden during your visit.

Cherry Laurels, boxwood hedges and hundreds of flowers provide beautiful color throughout the year dotted with the original mythological statues including Mother Nature, Cupid, a cherub, hippocampus, Native American hunter, deer, egret and frogs.

Included with your tour purchase, you can enjoy complimentary access to Sarah Winchester’s Gardens for a self-guided outdoor experience.
