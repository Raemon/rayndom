# Festival Fright Nights at Winchester Mystery House: Bay Area Halloween Haunt

## **Festival Fright Nights at Winchester Mystery House**

A new chapter of Halloween begins at one of the most mysterious mansions in the world.

For the first time ever, the creatives behind Queen Mary’s Dark Harbor and Los Angeles Haunted Hayride are heading north to the Bay Area to bring a haunting Halloween experience to Winchester Mystery House.

**Festival Fright Nights** is an all-new Halloween event running select nights from **September 26 through November 1, 2025** , and tickets are officially on sale now at [FestivalFrightNights.com](https://festivalfrightnights.com).

_**It’s not every day you enter a haunted house set inside a house already rumored to be haunted.**_

### What to Expect:

It is Halloween night, 1924—two years after Sarah Winchester’s passing. A mysterious host has invited you to a decadent masquerade ball, claiming they’ve opened a spiritual gateway inside the mansion that will finally reveal why Sarah Winchester built her endless house of secrets. But this house has never been one to give up its secrets without a price…

_This fully immersive event features:_

  * Three all-new haunted attractions across the Winchester estate

  * Theatrical performances and interactive storylines unfolding throughout the night

  * Themed food, cocktails, and more

  * Access to exclusive areas of the mansion not opened to the public




### Ticket Info:

---|---  
**General Admission** | Access to all 3 haunted attractions via standard queue (timed entry; arrive ~15 minutes early).  
**Fast Pass** | Everything in General Admission, plus priority queue access at each haunted attraction (cuts wait times ~50%, varies by night).  
**VIP Masquerade Invitation** | Front-of-line access to haunted attractions in General Admission **plus** Maestro’s Halloween Masquerade inside the mansion with a welcome cocktail (21+ or zero-proof option) and masquerade mask.  
  
Plus, don’t miss out on add-on experiences like axe throwing, The Underhouse, a theatrical Houdini séance, and speakeasy access.

### Why You’ll Want Tickets Early:

This is the **first time** Thirteenth Floor Entertainment Group has brought their signature scares to Northern California with a brand-new Bay Area Halloween Haunt at Winchester Mystery House. With a limited number of nights and high anticipation, **tickets are expected to sell out quickly**.
