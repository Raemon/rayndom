## AXE THROWING

Step back in time into the shoes of Sarah Winchester’s workers and experience the thrill of throwing axes at targets. Compete against your friends or family to see who can hit the bullseye and become a true axe-pert! After signing a waiver and a short coaching activity, you’re ready to throw. Come experience the all-new Bay Area activity at the Winchester Mystery House – Axe Throwing at the Stables! Tickets are available on site. Must be 18 and older to participate. **_Weather Notice: Axe throwing will be closed in the rain._**

**For Groups of 15 or More:** Please note that we require a minimum of three weeks notice when booking to allow for proper preparation and staffing. Thank you for understanding.
