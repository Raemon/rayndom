While the architectural charm of Sarah’s mansion dates back centuries, we understand that accessibility is important for all of our visitors.

To ensure that all visitors can enjoy the rich history, we offer a range of accessible options:

**2\. American Sign Language Tour:** On select dates, we offer ASL guided tours with fluent interpreters. Alternatively, guests are welcome to bring their own interpreter to any tour at no additional cost for their ticket. 

**3\. Immersive 360 Tour (online)** : Navigate through the rooms and behind the ropes of Sarah’s mansion at your own pace, soaking in the details as if you were here in person. Please note, that this online experience does not include narration.
