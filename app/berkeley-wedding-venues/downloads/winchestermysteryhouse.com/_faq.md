____ Q: Help! I'm Late For My Tour! What Do I Do?

Because we are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, we understand all about traffic making you late for something! Never fear, our team will take care of you. If you are 5-10 minutes late, you can be caught up to your tour or we will get you placed on the next available tour.

____ Q: Is There Parking Onsite?

Yes, we have two complimentary parking lots available onsite. One is directly on property in the front and the other is directly behind us off of Olsen Drive. We do advise larger vehicles and RV’s to utilize the lot behind us. If both parking lots are full, you can find additional parking located at Santana Row. Please be aware that Olsen Drive does not permit on-street parking, and towing or ticketing may occur. We also offer lockers on site for valuables and luggage.

____ Q: Is The Winchester Mystery House Child Friendly?

All that talk of paranormal sometimes worries parents that the tour will be too scary for children. Not to worry – all ages are welcome and the Mansion Tour is very family friendly! Children four and under are free and ages 5-12 will need a ticket. We do ask that any minor be accompanied with an adult at any time. So go ahead, bring the family!

____ Q: Can I Bring My Dog?

We love furry companions, but unfortunately, we do not allow pets on the estate except for service animals. Visiting and need a place to leave your pet? There are a few doggie day cares nearby.

____ Q: Is The House Climate Controlled?

Due to the age of our historic home, there is no central air or heat. While we do have fans in the summertime and heaters in the wintertime, we cannot heat/cool the entire house completely. We do advise all guests to dress for the time of year, light layers during summer and a warm jacket for winter. If you get uncomfortable on tour, please let your tour guide know and we will do our best to assist you.

____ Q: Do You Hold Private Events Or Weddings?

Yes, the Winchester Mystery House offers venue rentals for private events and weddings. Please head to our [event page](https://winchestermysteryhouse.com/private-events-and-weddings/) to learn more and submit an inquiry.

Please note: Overnight rentals and private paranormal investigations are not available to the general public.

____ Q: Do You Allow Paranormal Investigations, And Can I Do One On Property?

Over our 101 year history we have hosted famous investigators like Houdini, Sylvia Brown, James Van Praagh, Zak Bagans and most recently TAPS West Coast. We’ve been featured on Unsolved Mysteries, Ghost Adventures and many others. As the caretakers of Sarah Winchester’s home, we do not allow for guests to hold private investigations and extend our invitation for investigations selectively, ensuring that they will respect Sarah Winchester’s memory and her beautiful home. You can contact our marketing department to inquire further.

____ Q: I Took A Photo Before My Tour, But Didn't Buy It. Can I Still Do So?

Nothing worse that missing that one of kind photo. What’s the opposite of buyers remorse? Never fear, you can contact our photography vendor, [Mystery Pix](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b5f8ccc6c1d0c7ccc5dccd87858487f5d2d8d4dcd99bd6dad8) to get your photos!

____ Q: Are Photos Allowed On Tour?

We allow non-flash photography during daytime tours inside the mansion. There is still no photography during Halloween tours due to safety requirements. Videography or live streaming is not allowed on while on tour due to copyright. So, take some pics, share them on social and tag us @ winchestermysteryhouse.

____ Q: Are There A Lot Of Stairs, And Is The House Easily Accessible Or Movable For Those With Disabilities?

There are 47 staircases in the mansion. Due to Sarah Winchester’s home being built in a period even prior to elevators, the house is not easily accessible. We do have three elevators she installed later in construction of the Winchester Mystery House®, but due to safety of our guests, these are inoperable. We do offer a video access tour on the property, [click here](https://winchestermysteryhouse.com/tours/) for details.

____ Q: Is The House Wheelchair Accessible?

Winchester Mystery House® is a historic home and is not currently wheelchair accessible. However, the grounds and gift shop are wheelchair accessible. In addition, there is an ADA video tour available on property. The ADA tour includes a video tour in one of the accessible garden buildings and the self-guided Sarah Winchester Garden Tour. Please click the “Buy Tickets” button on the top of the page to view availability.

____ Q: I Think I Caught Something I Can't Explain In A Photo. Can You Look At It?

We have many guests who believe that they have captured something unexplained in a photo. While we would love to be able to confirm or deny that you did, the Winchester Mystery House® staff are not photo experts. We do encourage you to post your photo on Instagram with hashtag #winchestermysteryhouse, and let the community decide!

____ Q: I Want To Have Engagement/Graduation/Any Other Photos Taken Of Me Professionally On The Outside Grounds, Is There A Charge For That?

Tickets to Sarah’s Winchester’s Garden Tour grants you access to the gardens and grounds if you would like to visit the estate.

____ Q: Are There Overnight Stays?

Spending the night in an old Victorian mansion sounds like fun – if you are into that sort of thing. But unfortunately, at this time, Winchester Mystery House® is not open for overnight guests. We are always looking at offering new experiences, but for now you’ll have to settle in for the night somewhere else. However, a few times a year there are nighttime tours. Check any upcoming events for details.

____ Q: Is There Food Onsite?

Yes! Our newly reopened Cafe 13 is open daily from 10 AM to 3 PM. Located inside of our gift shop, the cafe will be serving breakfast, lunch, snacks, and drinks.

____ Q: Is Food Allowed On Tours?

Unfortunately, food is not allowed on tours, however bottled beverages with a sealed cap are. We do encourage guests to bring a bottle of water on tour, especially during the warm summer months.

____ Q: Is The House Really Haunted?

That’s just part of the mystery, right? Since 1923, many guests and employees have experienced strange phenomena while inside Sarah Winchester’s beautiful mansion. Although we’ve been listed on plenty of “world’s most haunted places” lists, we encourage you to come and find out for yourself.

____ Q: I Mailed In A Donation Request But Haven't Heard Back. What Do I Do?

____ Q: Is It Cheaper To Buy Tickets Online Or On Site At The Box Office?

Guests that purchase onsite are given the first available tour, which during busy days may be up to a 1-2 hour wait time. The benefit of booking your tour online is securing your reservation for the desired time and planning your visit accordingly. There is no price difference for buying online versus at the box office.

____ Q: I Received A Ticket Voucher From An Auction Or Was Gifted Tickets. How Do I Redeem Them?
