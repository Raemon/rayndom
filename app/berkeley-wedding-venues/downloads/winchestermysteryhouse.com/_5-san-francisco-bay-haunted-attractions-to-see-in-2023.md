## #1 Unhinged: Housewarming 

The Winchester Mystery House’s Unhinged: Housewarming combines the starlit allure of old Hollywood, the pervasive paranoia of the Prohibition Era, and the country’s spookiest mansion to create a uniquely eerie experience. 

The backdrop of this haunted attraction is a lavish and opulent garden party hosted by celebrity couple Miles and Flora Taylor. Though the public is dying for an invitation to the exclusive soiree the society papers have dubbed “The Event of the Century,” something sinister lurks beneath the glitzy surface. 

Unhinged: Housewarming offers scares inside the Winchester Mystery House and the outdoor scare zone, plus a Halloween museum that gives visitors a glimpse into yesteryear with vintage costumes, decor, and more.
