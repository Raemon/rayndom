Join Janan Boehme – official house historian and curator – for a rare and intimate 2-hour tour through the Winchester Mystery House. With a small group, you’ll go past ropes, and through locked doors, gaining a deeper understanding of the house’s construction and ongoing preservation efforts. All from the foremost expert on the property.

For the first hour and 20 minutes, your group will have the mansion entirely to yourselves… no other guests in sight.

This limited experience takes place select Saturday mornings in January. Tickets are on sale now! $99 per person before taxes and fees.

**Current available tour dates: January 10, 17 and 31.**

Please be aware: Due to the historic nature, Winchester Mystery House® is not wheelchair accessible. This tour involves multiple stairs and extensive walking throughout the home.

**We recommend arriving at least 15 minutes early. The estate opens at 10am, but for this tour we’ll be opening the gates just once, a few minutes before your start time. If you’re late, we won’t be able to reopen the gates as the property is still closed, so please be on time.**

## Meet Janan Boehme

Janan Boehme isn’t just the House Historian of the Winchester Mystery House—she’s part of its story. A Santa Clara native, Janan first stepped into the mansion in the late 1970s as a teenage tour guide, and over the past 40+ years, she’s held nearly every role imaginable within its walls. Her lifelong relationship with the house gives her a rare, almost uncanny familiarity with its **layers of history and unanswered questions**.

With a B.A. in Foreign Languages and Art History from the University of Santa Clara and a Master’s in International Business, Janan brings a global perspective to her work. She has lived, studied, and worked across Europe, honing a sharp eye for architectural detail and historical nuance. Her career also includes years as a financial writer and editor—skills she now uses to weave together the mansion’s scattered facts, folklore, and forgotten voices into one captivating narrative.

With Janan, a tour isn’t just a walk through an old house—it’s a journey through time, mystery, and legends guided by someone who knows every creaking floorboard and forgotten corner. If anyone can help you unlock the **legacy and enigma** of Sarah Winchester, it’s her.
