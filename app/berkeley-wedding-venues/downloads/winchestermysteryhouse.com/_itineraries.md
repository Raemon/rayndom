## HELPFUL TIPS FOR YOUR VISIT

**Purchase Tickets Online:**

Do you know what date you will be visiting? Save time by purchasing tickets on our website in advance! Purchasing your tickets in person when you arrive will put you on the first available tour, which may result in a longer wait time and if it is a busy day, we may be sold out.

**Beat The Crowds:**

The weekends here can get quite busy – we recommend visiting us Monday-Thursday to beat the rush and have a more relaxed experience. Please note that June and July are an exception, as every day tends to be busy during that time.
