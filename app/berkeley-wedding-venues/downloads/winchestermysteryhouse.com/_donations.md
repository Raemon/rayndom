# DONATION REQUESTS

The Winchester Mystery House® offers in-kind donation items _(2 admission tickets)_ for non-profit organizations that serve San Francisco Bay Area youth and family services, youth education and/or those groups that provide enrichment activities for the underserved. We ask that organizations seeking a donation understand the following:

Winchester Mystery House® will no longer accept donation requests via mail, email, fax or telephone. All donation requests must now be submitted online. **Requests must be received at least 45 days prior to the event date.** If approved, all items donated are at the discretion of Winchester Mystery House™

Because Winchester Mystery House® receives hundreds of donation requests each week, the demand far outweighs our ability to offer support via item donation. **Therefore, we do not have items in our inventory that are designated for the following:** athletic programs, organizations outside of the Bay Area, pre-schools, nursery schools, or private schools, individual participation fundraisers (Walk-a-Thons, Team-in-Training, Relay For Life, etc.), third party fundraising initiatives, recreational activities (camps, scout troops, sports leagues, field trips, graduation nights, etc.), political or religious groups, and incentive programs.

We receive a high number of requests and will review all donation requests as soon as possible. The organization requesting the donation will be contacted by email, regardless of whether or not the request is approved.
