Join fellow Gamble Garden Members as journalist and historian, Robin Chapman, moderates programs with a focus on local history, especially with connections to the Gamble Family and Gamble Garden.

On Thursday, March 20, 2025, author, speaker, and historian Naomi Shibata brings to light how the Domoto family was pivotal in 19th & 20th century Oakland/San Francisco as growers. In the 1930’s, Toichi Domoto provided plants, including camellias, to Elizabeth Gamble. Earlier, both before and after the 1906 Earthquake, his father, with other Japanese growers, established the first and eventual flower mart in San Francisco. This was quite an accomplishment for immigrants!
