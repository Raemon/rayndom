# Who Killed Jane Stanford?

Date:

## Wednesday, March 20, 2024 @ 4:30 pm \- 5:30 pm

Location:

[ 1431 Waverley Street   
Palo Alto, CA 94301 United States ]()

Registration is closed. This event is at capacity. 

When Jane Lathrop Stanford, the eigth First Lady of California and co-founder of Stanford University, died in 1905, her last words were, “I have been poisoned.” The cause of death was determined to be strychnine poisoning, but David Starr Jordan, then-president of Stanford University, managed to suppress the report and announced her death to be of natural causes. That coverup was accepted as truth for decades, until the 1980s.

Join fellow Gamble Garden Members as presenter Susan Wolfe takes a closer look at this hushed-up scandal, why the poisoning was likely intentional, and most importantly…whodunit.

This is a Gamble Member Event. Registration lists are checked with member lists. You may be asked to confirm your membership in a follow up email.
