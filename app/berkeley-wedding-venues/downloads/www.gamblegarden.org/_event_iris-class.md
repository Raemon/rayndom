Did you know that irises were Elizabeth Gamble’s favorite flower? She even has an iris named for her! In addition to the ‘Elizabeth Gamble’ iris, we have many different kinds of irises here at Gamble Garden.

In this class, you will learn about the iris family and develop a deeper appreciation for Elizabeth Gamble’s favorite flower.

Explore the history of iris, from Greek myth to heraldry to Vincent Van Gogh. Learn about the complex mix of iris hybrids from tall bearded iris to our native Pacific Coast hybrids. Discover members of the iris family beyond the Iris genus, such as walking irises and fortnight lilies. Gain practical knowledge on growing and caring for common kinds of iris, including tips on where to plant them and how to keep them blooming and healthy. The class includes a walking tour of the gardens to view Gamble Garden’s irises, including our collection of early Dykes Medal-winning bearded irises. Led by Gamble plant geek Cheryl Renshaw, this class is suitable for beginners and experienced growers.
