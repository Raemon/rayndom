Spend time with instructor Frank Niccoli as he introduces students to the world of bulbs. Learn how to plant them, how to care for them, and how to hook your friends on BULBS. Get ready to be smitten by these inexpensive yet gorgeous, drought-proof, foolproof plants!

As Frank puts it, “”How many of us were given a potted lily at Easter not knowing that this innocent flower was going to seduce you into a life of decadence. Should I buy milk for the kids or some bulbs for that shady spot in that corner? Sorry, kids. Bulbs are an obsession and once they have you they will continue to inspire you to greater heights of learning and understanding this sometimes forgotten plant.”

This class 1.5 -hr class is suitable for adults and teens and includes a Q&A session. No experience necessary.
