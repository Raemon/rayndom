Celebrate the start of spring at Gamble Garden! Gamble Garden welcomes you to spend a beautiful April morning exploring the California native plants at Gamble. Second Saturdays are free and open to all.

Did you know that Gamble Garden has its own Native Garden? This 0.3-acre parcel features water-wise California Native Plants, including many Pacific Coast Iris hybrids that bloom in late winter. Come explore this area with us, along with the rest of the garden, including our Mediterranean bed installation.

### FREE Activities (more information coming soon!)

**Guided Tours for Adults**  
The thirty-minute tour will include a look at the gardens as they reach their early spring perfection. This month’s theme will be CA wildflowers and plants from around the world that thrive in California.

**Guided Tours for Families**  
Go on a fun scavenger hunt and learn a thing or two about nature!

**Visit Elizabeth’s House**  
Walk through Elizabeth’s house, built in 1902, and get a look into the early days of Palo Alto. Our docents will be on hand to answer questions and share stories of old.

Second Saturday is free and appropriate for all ages. Register for timed entry at 10:00 AM, 10:30 AM, or 11:00 AM. All Second Saturday guests, when you arrive, please check in at one of our two Welcome Tables in order to enjoy the Second Saturday tours and special activities.
