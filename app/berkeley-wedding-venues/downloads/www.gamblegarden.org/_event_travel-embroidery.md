Calling all intrepid travelers! Join artist Robert Mahar in creating a charming set of embroidered souvenir postcards. He has searched near and far for a collection of vintage travel postcards that he’s digitally restored, reprinted and made ready just for you. Instruction will guide you through best practices for stitching on paper, including the transfer of imagery and patterns, and clever finishing techniques. The resulting set can be displayed as reminders of actual or imaginary adventures, or sent to loved ones as deliverable mail art.

This workshop ventures around many traditional techniques and embraces an approach to embroidery that is more freeform in nature, allowing you to stitch paper in a fun and unique way. Choose your own adventure, selecting a palette, design and stitch placements all your own.

Please note that while you’ll receive a set of postcards that include some of Robert’s favorite U.S. travel destinations, you’ll learn stitching techniques that can be applied to examples in your own collection. Instruction also includes discussion of the many ways in which these stitched pieces of ephemera can be incorporated into multi-media artist books or wall panels.

All materials are provided and included in the cost of the class. Each material kit includes: a set of custom printed paper postcards, gridded practice paper, ruler, a limited palette of embroidery floss, adhesive and embroidery needles. However, if you have favorite embroidery tools or prefer specific colors of embroidery floss (6-strand or perle) you are encouraged to bring these items to the workshop.

This is a project well suited for everyone, no previous experience is necessary. Ideal for ages 13+ (students under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a registered adult)
