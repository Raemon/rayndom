### *Class Full*

May is a month to celebrate mothers and the incredible women in our lives. Why not honor them with a special floral design class, where creativity blooms just as brightly as the season?

Join us for a hands-on experience as we create vibrant, spring-inspired arrangements featuring flowers that are abundant in the garden, including tulips, ranunculus, narcissus, and more. Using foam-free mechanics, you’ll learn to design a colorful, seasonal arrangement that highlights the beauty of these unique blooms. All floral material and container provided. Please bring your own favorite pair of floral clippers to class.

Katherine will share some essential tips and tricks for the care and handling of these delicate flowers, ensuring your arrangements last long after the class ends.

Bring your loved ones, embrace the joy of spring, and spend a memorable morning surrounded by flowers, fun, and creativity!

Class is suitable for high school age and older. Size is limited to 15 attendees.

All floral material and container provided. Please bring your own favorite pair of floral clippers to class.
