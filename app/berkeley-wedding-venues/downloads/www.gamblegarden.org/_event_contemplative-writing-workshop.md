### This class has been cancelled due to extreme temperature concerns

Wonder, wander, and write. Share insights in the Gamble Garden at this contemplative writing workshop.

The workshop will be led by Adela C. Licona, Associate Professor Emeritus of English and Rhetoric, University of Arizona. Adela will offer a series of writing prompts that encourage and guide writers to experience the natural world as a site and source of inspiration, awe, and delight and to practice new ways of seeing and relating.

After meeting in the Tea House , attendees will stroll together with Adela through the garden in shared observation and contemplation as well as writing in particularly beautiful areas that are in bloom or fall transition. Attendees should bring their own writing materials. A writing journal or notepad and pencil or pen are ideal.

Enrollment will be limited to 10 participants to allow attendees to fully experience the beautiful garden in a small group. This class is suitable for adults.
