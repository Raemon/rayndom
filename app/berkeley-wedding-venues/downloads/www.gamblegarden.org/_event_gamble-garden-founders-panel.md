### Learn how Gamble Garden was founded

Local history comes alive as Gamble Garden kicks off its 40th Anniversary Celebration with a Founders Panel, co-hosted by the Palo Alto Historical Association.

Moderated by Gamble Garden Executive Director Mica Pirie, the panel will feature Karen Olson and Herb Fong, members of the original Gamble Garden Executive Committee, as well as Scott Loosley, Gamble Garden’s first horticulturist. The panel will share details and stories about the work they did 40 years ago, to ensure that the Gamble property would remain a garden, open for the public to enjoy, learn, and support. A must for Palo Alto history buffs, Gamble Garden supporters, and the community!

This event will be held at the Palo Alto Art Center on 1313 Newell Road.

Gamble Garden is grateful to have the [Midpen Media Center](https://midpenmedia.org/) sponsor this event, and collaborate with the [Palo Alto Historical Association](http://www.pahistory.org/about.html) on this presentation.
