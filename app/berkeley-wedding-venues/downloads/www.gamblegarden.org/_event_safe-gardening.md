Have you ever spent a glorious day digging in the dirt, only to wake up the next morning hurting all over? Has a sore back kept you from gardening as much as you want to? Why not learn to garden in a way that helps rather than hurts your body? Join Gokhale Method founder (and seasoned gardener) Esther Gokhale for a special 1 ¼ -hour Workshop designed to take the “ouch” out of your time in the garden. Prevent injuries before they set in by learning healthy posture approaches in common gardening positions and actions. We’ll leave you with tips to keep the techniques on your radar as you apply them in your life. You — and your flower and vegetable beds — will reap the benefits!

Esther’s book [8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back](https://shop.gokhalemethod.com/products/8-steps) has sold over 300,000 copies and has been translated into 10 languages. The book will be available at the class and Esther will be happy to sign purchased copies. The class will include time for Q&A.

This class is suitable for teens and adults.
