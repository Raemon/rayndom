### A Cabaret Concert featuring the Music of Richard Rodgers, live at Gamble Garden

Award-winning singer, Annemarie Ballinger, with special guest vocalist, Grant Thompson and accompanied by Daniel Lockert at the keyboard and Chuck Bennett on bass, is pleased to present “SOMETHING WONDERFUL – A Tribute to the Music of Richard Rodgers” live at Gamble Garden! Come hear songs by this iconic and groundbreaking composer, as well as stories of his life and partnerships with lyricists Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein.

Richard Rodgers’ extraordinary career, which spanned 6 decades and included 43 Broadway musicals to his credit, gave us music that is just as rich in quality as it is in quantity! Who could imagine a world without the great songs from “Oklahoma”, “Carousel”, “The Sound of Music”, or “The King and I”. Or some of his early songs that became standards, such as “Lover”, “My Funny Valentine” and “I Wish I Were In Love Again”. Many of these songs, related stories and lesser-known gems will be performed in this concert.

This event is suitable for adults and teens. The concert will be held outside on the Carriage House Patio, so please dress accordingly. Doors open at 4:30pm. The concert will run from 5:00pm to 6:45, with a 15-minute intermission. Audience members are allowed to bring their own light snack and beverage of choice to the concert.

Annemarie’s debut CD, “Gershwin and Friends”, will be available for purchase. This recently completed album also features some of the best jazz and cabaret musicians in the Bay Area, including Ken Muir (piano), Chuck Bennett (bass), Jim Zimmerman (drums), Jeff Massanari (guitar), Noel Jewkes.
