Join us as we explore the mindfulness practice of tai chi and Qigong. Tai chi is proven to improve balance, joint mobility and Qi (life force energy). First, instructor Jason Chen will lead the class through Chen tai chi “silk reeling” exercises. The wonderfully simple, flowing patterns circulate the blood, qi and integrate all aspects of your being….beautiful! Second, follow Jason as he leads you through ancient tai chi routines originating from Taoist Yin/Yang philosophy. No memorization or experience necessary, come as you are and enjoy!

Class will be held in the plant greenhouse area in the garden. Chairs will be provided. This class is suitable for adults and teens.
