## About the Artists

When Mimi Fox and Jason Keiser play together, one can immediately recall the rich and inspiring lineage of guitar duets between such artists as Joe Pass & Herb Ellis, Chet Atkins & Lenny Breau, Chet Atkins & Jerry Reed, and Tony Rice & John Carlini. The guitar slinging duo released their first original music duet entitled; _“[Mimi’s Mode](https://www.allaboutjazz.com/media/track-mimis-mode-feat-mimi-fox)”_ in August 2022.

Praise from jazz guitar greats:

“ _Mimi and Jason take a spirited and often rambunctious jaunt on Mimi’s Mode. Some great playing here… sit back and enjoy the ride!_ ” — Bruce Forman

“ _Mimi and Jason are kindred spirits, and they play with a real passion and empathy on Jason’s original tune dedicated to Mimi. Jason’s acoustic blends beautifully with Mimi’s electric and their conversation makes for compelling listening._ ” — John Stowell

“ _Mimi and Jason tear it up on this energetic romp. Great playing and a sonic delight._ ” — Pat Kelley

### **Mimi Fox**

Internationally renowned guitarist/composer/recording artist Mimi Fox has been cited in numerous Downbeat Magazine International Critics Polls and has been recognized by writers and colleagues alike as one of the most eloquent guitarists on today’s scene. In one of many feature stories, Jazz Times hailed Mimi as”a blazing fret master who combines be-bop infused lines with an abundance of soul…spinning solos that unfurl with surprise twists like expertly tailored short stories.” In a further nod to Mimi’s guitar artistry, and in conjunction with Heritage Guitars’ 30th anniversary, the historic Kalamazoo guitar company has rolled out the Mimi Fox Artist Signature model. Mimi has performed/recorded with some of the music world’s most commanding players, including fellow guitarists Charlie Byrd, Stanley Jordan, and Charlie Hunter, Grammy-nominated saxophonists Branford Marsalis, David Sanchez, Houston Person, and the late Don Lanphere, vocalists Tierney Sutton, Kevin Mahogany, and Janis Siegel (Manhattan Transfer), B3 organ masters Joey DeFrancesco, Barbara Denerlein and Dr. Lonnie Smith, and powerhouse drummers Billy Hart and Terri Lyne Carrington. She has also shared the stage with legends Stevie Wonder, and Peter Yarrow (Peter, Paul, and Mary) and toured as a featured artist with Patty Larkin’s Vanguard Records-produced La Guitara project. Her YouTube videos have received hundreds of thousands of views.

As a virtuosic improviser who’s collaborated with many of jazz’s greatest figures, Mimi Fox has earned her spot in the jazz guitar pantheon. But the jazz tradition is only one of the powerful currents feeding her music. With her 11th album as a leader or co-leader, This Bird Still Flies, Fox delivers a seamless but far-ranging album that’s breathtaking in its beauty, emotional immediacy and stylistic reach. The all acoustic recording captures a commanding artist in full – transforming folk tunes, jazz standards, original compositions and popular songs into exquisitely crafted improvisational vehicles.
