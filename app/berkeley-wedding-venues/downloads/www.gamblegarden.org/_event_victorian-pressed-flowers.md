Explore the popular mid-19th Century pastime of creating an Herbarium, a collection of dried flora assembled for decorative purposes or as a garden record. Learn best practices and techniques for working with delicate pressed flowers. In this special two-hour workshop, you will create your own imaginative floral compositions mounted on paper. Your final results will be suitable for framing or stationery. Instruction will include the fabrication of a simple wood flower press to preserve specimens from your own home garden.

Ideal for Ages: 13 years old and up; beginners welcomed (no prior experience necessary). All class materials included. Each student will leave the workshop with a materials kit to recreate the fun at home: a selection of dried and pressed flowers, paper, adhesive, assembly tools, pre-cut wood, paper, cardboard and hardware to assemble a small-scale flower press.
