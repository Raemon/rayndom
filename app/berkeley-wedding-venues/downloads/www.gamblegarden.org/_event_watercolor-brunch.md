Join New York Times bestselling author and illustrator Erin Gleeson for an inspiring morning of creativity, conversation, and watercolor painting. She’ll talk about her latest book, “The Watercolor Feast”, which is all about learning to paint simple fruits, vegetables and edible flowers (for beginners!). As Erin talks about her journey we’ll enjoy a colorful brunch buffet of vegetarian recipes from her Forest Feast cookbooks. Guided by the author, guests will be able to explore the watercolor medium themselves at each table. All attendees will receive a copy of Erin’s book, “The Watercolor Feast” to take home. Invite a friend or relative and make some time for creativity in the garden this spring!

### Instructor Bio

Author, Photographer and Illustrator of The Forest Feast Cookbook Series, Erin Gleeson is the New York Times bestselling cookbook author and artist behind the lifestyle brand The Forest Feast. After working in New York as a food photographer, she left the city for a cabin in the woods which took her work in a whole new direction. Inspired by local California produce, she has now created 5 vegetarian cookbooks and a line of products that showcase her unique blend of photography overlaid with watercolor illustrations and hand lettering. Erin’s goal is to inspire people to be creative at home, to cook, set a beautiful table, entertain, and share time together.
