Dive into the fundamentals and creativity of brush lettering. This lettering method — a type of calligraphy — uses a special marker with a flexible brush tip. The style tends to look bolder as the tip doesn’t allow for thin lines such as a pointed pen. You will be introduced to pressure practice and basic strokes in order to create beautifully written letters. Learn letter connections to create words. Instructor is Bay Area calligraphy artist, Vivan Pham. Students age 12 and up. All materials included.
