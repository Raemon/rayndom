Explore the hypnotic world of Resin Art. We will introduce you to this art form by creating a pressed-flower, glossy, wooden vessel using resin techniques. Resin is a durable epoxy that leaves a protective, high-gloss finish on surfaces. Known for its versatility, resin is often applied to many surfaces — wood, glass, terracotta, ceramic tiles — for functional purposes (seal a table top) or decorative applications (jewelry, paintings).

In our hands-on class, you will learn to embellish a Crate & Barrel gorgeously grained acacia wood plate with dried foliage, ferns and flowers. Then pour resin to cast a unique and beautiful personalized tray for everyday use, entertaining or artful display. Once you have mastered using resin, your creative options are endless. All supplies provided. No previous experience necessary. Ideal for ages 13 and up.
