Juana Briones (1802-1889) was a Mexican American healer, businesswoman and landowner who once owned a 4,400 acre cattle ranch spanning Palo Alto and Los Altos. She is the subject of a fascinating biography: **Juana Briones of 19th Century California** written in 2008 by former Gamble member Jeanne Farr McDonnell. Juana triumphed over an abusive husband and government agencies that tried to take her land. Join us and special guests for a discussion of the woman, the biography, and the Juana Briones legacy in Palo Alto today.
