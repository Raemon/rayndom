Did you know that Gamble Garden has been recognized by the American Camellia Society as part of the American Camellia Trail? We have over 50 camellia cultivars, including Camellia japonica ‘Kumasaka’ 1695, one of the oldest camellias in continuous culture.

In this 90-minute class, you will discover the fascinating world of camellias and develop a deeper appreciation for one of Elizabeth Gamble’s favorite flowers.

Explore the history of camellias, from their origins in ancient China to their global impact. Learn about the diverse array of camellia species and cultivars, and gain practical knowledge on growing and caring for camellias including tips on soil preferences, pruning and watering techniques, and how to protect camellias from pests and diseases. The class includes a walking tour of the gardens to view Gamble Garden’s historic camellia collection. Led by Gamble Garden Director Corey Andrikopoulos, this class is suitable for beginners and experienced growers.
