## LIFE IS SIMPLY BETTER IN A GARDEN

Maybe it’s the chance to stop and reflect; maybe it’s just the astounding beauty.

The Elizabeth F. Gamble Garden, a non-profit organization, is a remarkable resource for everyone. Located in Old Palo Alto, our historic property has a rich legacy, a commitment to education, and year-round beauty. Come see Gamble for yourself—it’s free and the garden is open to the public every day during daylight hours.

Our historic two-and-a-half acre property includes a rose garden, cutting garden, formal herb garden, demonstration bed, wisteria garden, and an allée. Here are five good reasons to get outdoors at Gamble: Enjoy a new view, Notice what’s in bloom, Ditch the tech (for a bit), Relax and re-center, Take a breath of fresh air.

Come enjoy Gamble Garden, operated by a small staff and a legion of volunteers for the enjoyment of all.
