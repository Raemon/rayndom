Gardening is America’s #1 hobby but is also highly implicated in causing back pain – and back pain is the world’s leading cause of disability. Join Gokhale Method founder (and seasoned gardener) Esther Gokhale for a special 11/4-hour workshop designed to help you plant, harvest, cook, and eat (we’ll simulate the entire cycle!) with posture that is constructive rather than destructive. You’ll learn practical techniques for relieving and preventing back pain that you can take with you forever.

This workshop is designed to take the “ouch” out of your time in the garden. Esther’s book “8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back” has sold over 300,000 copies and has been translated into 10 languages. The book will be available at the class and Esther will be happy to sign purchased copies. The class will include time for Q&A.

### Price

$28 Members (use code IRIS) / $35 Non-Members

### Instructor Bio

Esther Gokhale is the creator of the Gokhale Method®, a breakthrough in back pain relief. After experiencing crippling back pain during her first pregnancy and unsuccessful back surgery, Gokhale began her lifelong crusade to vanquish back pain. Inspired by Aplomb® and other anthropological approaches, Gokhale has grounded her work in biophysics and anthropology.
