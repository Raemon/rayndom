Mindful Movement and Mental Health in the Garden is an event geared towards middle and high school students to honor May as Mental Health Awareness Month.

This event aims to address some of the mental health challenges in the area and remind students that nature and Gamble Garden in particular, will always be a resource for them. Throughout the day Christina Miranda of the **Body Empowerment Project** will talk about self-care, intuition, and joyful movement.

We will start our meeting in either the carriage house or the open space area. We will start the mindful movement with 5 minutes of simple stretches and 5 minutes of mindful meditation. Throughout the event we will discuss the connection between gardening, working in nature, and positive mental health.

Mindful Meditation will be held in the allée and the wisteria garden (to listen to the fountains). After stretching and meditation, we will head to the Edible garden, where we will break out into groups to weed, water, and harvest in the edible garden beds.

After working in the garden we will prepare a light garden meal(a salad or something similar) and eat in the open space area with a few guided discussion questions.

This **FREE** event is suitable for Teens and will be held outdoors. We will supply gloves and tools for the work day.
