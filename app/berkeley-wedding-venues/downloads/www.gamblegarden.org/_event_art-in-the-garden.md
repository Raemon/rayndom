# Art In The Garden

Date:

## Tuesday, August 19, 2025 @ 5:00 pm \- 7:00 pm

Location:

[ 1431 Waverley Street   
Palo Alto, CA 94301 United States ]()

Join us for an evening of Art in the Garden, in partnership with the [Pacific Art League](https://www.pacificartleague.org/). Gamble Garden is transformed into an artists’ studio. Enjoy a glass of wine and wander in the garden where artists will be working – sketching, drawing and planning. Observe the artists, chat with them, and learn as they practice their art — sketching, painting, and more.

### Featured Artists

We are excited to welcome artists Lori Anderson, Natalia Drachinskaya, Emo Gonzalez, Denise Howard, Ria Krishnan, and Richard Man.

### Price

**$10 Tickets available at the door.** Enter in front of the Gamble House, off Waverley, near Churchill Ave.

No discounts. This event is suitable for adults. Pre-registration is closed.
