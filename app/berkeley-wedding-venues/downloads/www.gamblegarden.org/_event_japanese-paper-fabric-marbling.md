# Japanese Paper & Fabric Marbling

Date:

## Sunday, February 23, 2025 @ 10:00 am \- 12:00 pm

Location:

[ 1431 Waverley Street   
Palo Alto, CA 94301 United States ]()

### *CLASS FULL*

Join artist Robert Mahar in a playful introduction to suminagashi, a Japanese marbling technique that creates beautifully muted patterns of color to be transferred onto paper and fabric. Perfectly suited for beginners, participants will learn best practices for working with these specifically formulated floating inks and creative ways to manipulate them on the surface of a water bath. The resulting marbled designs will be captured on a variety of papers and silk handkerchiefs–and instruction will include discussion of the numerous ways you can incorporate these marbled materials into future projects.

This workshop is well suited for beginners – no previous experience is necessary. Ideal for ages 13+ (students under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a registered adult)

All materials are included and will be provided to participants when they arrive for the workshop. Each student will receive, and may take home at the end of class, an individual set of marbling inks, brushes, water pan, a variety of paper and silk handkerchiefs. Please wear clothing and shoes that you won’t mind getting splashed with water and (potentially, but unlikely!) stained with ink.
