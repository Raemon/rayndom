It's hard to find the right words to say other than The Grove ensured our special day was perfect. We worked with Amy - who walked us through planning, menu selection, decor, vendors, down to the simple little details that made it that much more special. She was there every step of the way - no question too big or small - which a type B bride like myself really appreciated. The food was also exceptional! With big Eastern European and Italian families like ours, that was really important. 2 months later, guests are still raving with special shoutouts to the to the grilled octopus, filet, and lobster risotto. The day of service is truly white glove. We opted to come early and get ready on site - they were also extremely accommodating to allergies, and provided both breakfast and lunch.

We got married at Waterloo in September 2025 and could not recommend it more highly. When we first toured the venue, it was clear that the Waterloo team was well-organized, experienced, and had a clear plan --- and, of course, it was obvious that the venue is beautiful. Throughout the planning process, the Waterloo team were very helpful, friendly, and always sent clear instructions about what was needed. The venue offers a wide range of menu and decor options, so you can really build a package based on what you're looking for. When the day finally came, the staff were amazing --- all the logistical details were taken care of, and the venue was decorated beautifully. Plus, as many other reviewers have pointed out, the food is incredible. Particularly if you are looking for something with a rustic feel, Waterloo is a great choice!

We were looking for a venue that would provide us a space that we could make our own as we envisioned a celestial-themed wedding, complete with planets hanging from the ceiling. Our contact, Stephanie, was fantastic and so prompt in responding to emails, which was great as I was seeking a responsive venue as it would make all the difference in coordinating with other vendors in the wedding planning process. On the day of, Stephanie worked with our day of coordinators, our vendors, and everyone on staff to make our day truly unique and memorable. For our day, we used the available bride and groom suites, the cube room, and the ballroom area divided into sections for cocktail hour and the reception. The Ballroom area has built-in light settings that really set the mood and added to our vendors' existing uplighting and our guests were able to take advantage of Golden Hour to take pictures on the walkway outside of the ballroom area as well, making for heavenly photos. We also took advantage of Bell Works' Bell Market Catering to feed our vendors breakfast and lunch on our wedding day and that was conveniently delivered to the groom's suite in a timely manner. I would definitely recommend Bell Works for anyone needing a large space for out-of-this-world ideas!

Our wedding was 10/25/2025! The team at Felina and head event coordinator Carissa were absolutely fabulous from the minute we toured until we said goodbye at our wedding. The planning stage was easy and organized no stress for the bride or groom. The day of was a dream zero stress no problems and shout out to Ricardo! He was with us every step of the way. Also for brides wanting to get ready at the venue the staff provided an amazing service all morning! People are still talking about the food and atmosphere. I recommend Felina to any future brides! They crushed it!

We held our reception at the Maplewood Woman's Club, and it was a perfect venue for us. It's a large open space with beautiful high ceilings, and this allowed us to really create the look we wanted. There were few restrictions, so we were able to bring in all of our rentals (as well as food and alcohol). One thing to note: there is a stage in the space that has curtains. We weren't too bothered by the curtains, and the stage was perfect for our band. There is a decent amount of parking at the venue, and also on the surrounding streets. There is no one on hand to help with wedding planning or coordinating, but that didn't bother us. We were able to bring our caterer one night to look at the space, which was very helpful. Overall, we were very pleased with the venue, the location, and the price!

We used the Colonial Inn for our lodging for family and wedding party, as well as some of our guests. Andrea and the staff were wonderful. All were very helpful. When I realized during my reception that I forgot to check in to my own suite for the night, The Smithville and Colonial Inns worked to make sure I was checked in and had a key. The breakfast baskets were a hit with guests and it was so nice to be able to eat outside with my mom and bridesmaids that morning before getting ready.

Excellent venue, great price and convenience location, beautiful place. The person who help us is very nice, but I little intense in my opinion, She needs to be informed, everyone is different and we like and do things differently from others people. Also she needs to wait until the event is over before she starts cleaning, that is kind of rude. I do appreciate all her help do not understand me wrong, but you will see what i mean.

I don’t know where to begin—Ellie and the rest of the amazing Chalfonte team gave us the wedding day of our dreams! From inquiring with Ellie a year before our wedding up until the day of, Ellie was there for us, answered every question thoughtfully and made us feel seen and taken care of throughout the whole process. We did a family style menu and everyone loved it. Our guests were RAVING about the food especially the fried chicken!! We only had a few guests with dietary restrictions who sought us out to tell us how impressed they were with their meals! Shoutout to the chef and kitchen crew—you guys rock. Above all, everyone who works at The Chalfonte was incredibly kind and went above and beyond for us. The drinks were an absolute hit. Our guests loved them and the bartenders who served them up!! The cocktail hour on the porch was beautiful and we heard from so many guests how much they loved it! We had an eight piece band that fit perfectly in the reception space, plenty of room for dancing, eating and talking. Front desk crew—Maddie, Maggie, Alexis and co. were so wonderful to us and all of our friends and family. The Chalfonte is a special place. We are immensely grateful to everyone there. We look forward to the days when we get to go back and visit! Amazing team!!!
