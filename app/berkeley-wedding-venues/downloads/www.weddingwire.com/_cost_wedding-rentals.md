## How much do wedding rentals cost?

On average, most couples in the U.S. spend between $425 to $1,000 on wedding rentals. Event rentals you will likely need for your wedding include tables, chairs, dinnerware, and much more. While it does cost money to rent these items, it’s certainly less expensive than buying every plate and fork you’ll need for your big day.

## What are some typical wedding rentals?

Some wedding venues may include rentals like tables, chairs, china, etc. in their packages. However, some do not—or you may not love your venue’s offerings. In these cases, booking a wedding rental company is a must. Wedding rental companies tend to offer a wider selection of items so that you can find tables, chairs, linens, and more that fit your wedding theme and style. Of course, remember that renting high-end, specialty, or custom items for your wedding can add to your wedding rental costs. Some of the [items you will need for your wedding that can be rented](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-things-you-should-not-forget-to-rent) are:

  * Tables
  * Chairs
  * Dance floor
  * Linens (tablecloths, napkins, chair covers, etc.)
  * Drapery

  * Audio/visual equipment
  * Tents
  * Vases and other vessels
  * China
  * Barware
  * Flatware
  * Glassware 



## How much does it cost to rent a wedding tent?

If you’re hosting a wedding in an outdoor space, [a tent may be a necessity](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/factors-to-consider-before-you-plan-a-tented-wedding) —both for your guests’ comfort and in case of inclement weather. There are many companies that specialize in tent rentals, and the average cost of a tent rental varies widely, but the average starting price for a tent rental in the U.S. is $300. You may also need to pay to reserve a tent in case of bad weather, even if you don’t end up using it. If you do use your rental, you’ll also have to pay for the labor to erect your wedding tent. There are numerous different types of tents to choose from, including clear-top tents, pole tents, marquee tents, and more, plus you may also need to rent utilities, such as generators, heating and cooling units, and even an outdoor catering kitchen, which can certainly add cost. You’ll want to work with your tent rental company to determine the best type of tent and any related utilities you will need for your special day. 

## How much does it cost to rent a wedding altar?

Renting a special altar for your wedding can add a unique touch and personality to your ceremony, especially when it is decorated with flowers by your florist. Many wedding rental companies offer altars and arches, as well as chuppahs and mandaps. In the U.S., the average starting price for an altar or arch is $75. Work with your venue, florist, and rental company to determine if an altar or arch is something you’ll need for your ceremony, and how it can be decorated.

## How much does it cost to rent wedding reception tables?

There are a variety of different wedding reception tables to choose from, depending on your wedding style and the types of tables your venue can accommodate. While round tables are the most common, square and long rectangular tables are also (on-trend!) options. The average starting price for wedding reception tables in the U.S. is $8 per table. You’ll want to ensure you know the reception table shapes and styles you’ll be featuring at your wedding so you can [create an accurate seating chart](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-create-your-wedding-seating-chart) and plan your decor accordingly.

## How much does it cost to rent wedding chairs?

Renting wedding chairs may seem pretty straightforward but there are actually [lots of chair options available](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/11-popular-wedding-chair-styles). From standard folding chairs to elegant Chiavari chairs, modern ghost chairs, rustic cross-back chairs, and more, you have many options when it comes to wedding chairs, both from a style perspective and cost. In the U.S., the average starting price for wedding chair rentals is $2 per chair. While renting folding chairs can be a less expensive endeavor, you may also wish to rent chair covers to dress them up.

## Is labor included in wedding rental costs?

Most of the time, labor is included in your wedding rental contract. Delivery people from your rental company will handle delivery, setup, and clean up at your venue. Be sure to discuss timing with your venue to make sure that your rental company delivers your rental items at the right time, leaving enough time to properly set up—and allowing your wedding florist to decorate your space as well. And don’t forget to [tip your delivery staff](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-tipping-guide). We recommend giving $5 to $20 per person to your delivery team, and be sure to [write an online review](https://www.weddingwire.com/shared/rate?formEntryPoint=40) for a rental company for a job well done.

## What are some questions to ask a wedding rental company?

When researching wedding rental companies, it’s important to find professionals who not only have fabulous rental offerings, but who you like and trust to avoid stress during your planning process and on your big day. Here are a few questions to ask wedding rental companies:

  * Have you worked in my venue before?
  * Have you worked with my florist and/or caterer before?
  * What types of rentals do you offer?
  * Can I see your offerings in person at your showroom?
  * Who will be on-site on my wedding day?
  * Can you describe what setup and breakdown look like?
  * Do you have rental suggestions for my venue and style?



## What are some ways to save on wedding rental costs?

It’s very easy for your wedding rental costs to rise so be sure to keep track of your wedding rental costs before they become out of control. Fortunately, there are a few simple ways to save money on your wedding rentals without sacrificing style:

  * Do your research: Talk to different wedding rental companies about their offerings, and their pricing. You may be able to find wide differences in pricing for the same items, or discounts. 
  * Book an [all-inclusive venue](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/what-is-an-all-inclusive-venue): Venues like hotels and country clubs may offer all rentals in-house, which can help you avoid delivery and other additional charges. Your caterer may also be able to provide these items at a lower cost.
  * Provide an accurate guest count: Make sure that your rental company, caterer, and venue have an accurate guest count in the days leading up to your wedding. You don’t want to pay for extra chairs, dishes, or glassware that you won’t end up using.
  * Double-duty chairs: If your wedding ceremony and reception are being held in the same venue, see if you can use the same chairs for both ceremony and reception. If you go this route, your cocktail hour should be held in an entirely different part of your venue so that your vendors can easily move the chairs from one area to another. 
  * Limit the fancy linens: Fancy tablecloths (hello sequins!) can be very expensive, so if you’re on a tight budget, don’t use the super-expensive linens for every table. Instead, use the luxe table coverings for your escort card table or sweetheart table only, or mix and match tablecloths so only a few of your tables have the super-pricey linens.
