The team at Deer Meadow lodge is the best. You will love working with a hands-on team that knows how to make you feel right at home. Plus the venue is to die for! It's not only beautiful, but the amenities and lodging offered make it one of a kind. Everything was thought of when Deer Meadow was designed - easy access for vendors, on site catering, full bathrooms with showers... they even have an afterparty pool! I loved it.

I got married at the ranch recently, and we had a wonderful time! Our main priority was spending time with our guests, and that goal was met by hosting them, as well as having all of our wedding events at the house. We had about 50 guests, and planned to have an outdoor wedding. But it rained! Luckily, we were able to have the ceremony outside and the home has a ton of space, so we easily moved the reception inside, with dinner in the living room and dancing in the basement. We planned our wedding from out of state and had a lot of questions leading up to it. Cameron was responsive and professional, and let us visit the house before booking. The kitchen is well stocked, the bedroom are good sized, we had enough parking for guests and vendors, and the hot tub was a god send. Also, the hiking trails behind the house are a must-do. My only note, is that it can be a little windy in the afternoon. So keep that in mind, when selecting decor.

The venue was absolutely stunning! The staff were very helpful and made sure everything ran smoothly on my wedding day. Venue was gorgeous inside and out and we got so many compliments! The only negative thing i would say is we weren’t allowed access to the venue till 2 on the wedding day, which made getting set up and all ready feel super super rushed and panicked before the ceremony. Other than that, it was amazing!

We got married at Knot & Pine in Alpine, Utah, on April 26, 2025, and it was truly everything we dreamed of. The venue’s rustic elegance, highlighted by natural wood beams and soft natural lighting, created a stunning atmosphere for both our ceremony and reception. One of our favorite features was the way sunlight streamed in through the large windows—it made every moment feel magical, and our photos turned out beautifully. The space struck the perfect balance between historic charm and modern amenities, with a cozy bridal suite, a groom’s loft, and everything we needed for a seamless celebration. What stood out, though, was the staff. They were attentive, professional, and always available when we needed them. Whether it was helping with last-minute details or simply making sure things flowed smoothly, their support helped us truly enjoy the day without stress. We also worked with Knot & Pine’s preferred florist, Millie, and it was such a smooth and beautiful experience. She and her team understood the rustic elegance of the venue perfectly and created floral arrangements that felt natural, romantic, and thoughtfully curated to match our vision. From the bridal bouquet to the centerpieces, everything was fresh, vibrant, and flawlessly arranged. The communication was easy, and they worked seamlessly with the venue staff on the day of the event. Highly recommend if you're looking for a florist who knows the space and can enhance its charm effortlessly. We recommend Knot & Pine to any couple looking for a warm, elegant, and thoughtfully run venue—it made our wedding day unforgettable.

I can’t recommend RBR enough. The venue is insanely gorgeous….truly jaw dropping. The whole team is kind and professional and helpful. Expect to follow some semi strict venue rules, but that’s how they keep the place so amazing. I absolutely loved every minute of my wedding there.
