Sam was amazing! He kept the dance floor busy ALL. NIGHT. LONG. I had so many of my guests comment on how they have never experienced such an amazing DJ at a wedding! He knew how to get every part of our crowd onto the dance floor, and when the older crowd left, he knew how to cater to the younger age group! I literally cannot recommend Sam enough because he truly made my wedding a night I will never forget. Without him, my wedding would have been great, but having Sam bring the energy to the dance floor made the whole thing absolutely, incredibly beyond my wildest dreams. I will cherish the wedding itself the rest of my life, largely due to the fact I got to dance with guests all night long! Sam is super easy to work with - I spoke with him a few times on the phone and his questionnaire pre-wedding is very thorough. He was very knowledgeable about the venue, and truly made everything seamless on the day. He really knows what he's doing! My biggest tip if you hire him - make sure you have a good number of songs that you request from him! He got the vibe of our crowd perfectly and I suspect that is, in part, due to the 20 ish songs we had included in a request list. Not all of them got played, but it was a great starting point and he played songs that fit into that list SO WELL. It seemed like he knew my music taste better than me by the end of the night! 15/10 please let Sam give you the wedding dance floor of your wildest dreams!

We wanted a big fun party, and we got it! When you're booking Ryan, you're not just getting music services and a full sound system with microphones. Our wedding (130ish guests) was in a rural area, in a big tent and everything was powered by generators. Ryan showed up early to test the sound system well in advance of our ceremony and worked with our officiant ahead of time to make sure the ceremony went smoothly. Then, he seamlessly transitioned songs in the ceremony based on human cues exactly the way we envisioned. Going into the reception, Ryan mixed the songs and genres we wanted and sprinkled in some excellent choices based on the vibe and setting. He also kept me (bride) and groom informed of potential changes in the timeline (i.e., dinner was ready a little early, and Ryan asked if we wanted to get dinner started early - we would never have known because we were so busy talking to different guests and family from out of town). Ryan facilitated dinner lines effortlessly, and without me even asking (Bride-Brain, it's a thing). There was probably a lot of other coordinating among vendors that Ryan was doing that we were too preoccupied to notice. It turns out that when you're the center of attention, you get too busy and overwhelmed with greeting guests to pay attention to timelines or notice things that may not be going to plan... Ryan was an awesome bridge between us and everything that needed to happen. As for Ryan's DJ services: 10/10! At the last minute, he added a fun surprise where the maid of honor and best man chose SONG INTROs to their speeches and it was so fun. While we planned on having guest trivia (in lieu of the shoe game or something similar) but dinner, music, speeches and dancing were going so well we didn't need extra entertainment. I wish I had more time to dance instead of meet and greet guests, because every time I looked at the dance floor there were people dancing and having a good time!

Shane was an incredible DJ, he was soo patient and helpful when we had an emergency at the reception! He did everything perfectly and was a blast to have at our wedding!!! Wouldn’t recommend any one else! They were extremely organized!! My photographers even mentioned that our DJ is the most organized one they have ever seen and dealt with! I can’t thank you Shane and Pro Dj for making our reception and ceremony so special and unforgettable! Thank you for being so fun and outgoing and playing everyone’s requests!!!

Travis was so knowledgeable and helped match our itinerary perfectly. He really took our personalities and crowd into consideration and helped make it everything I’ve ever dreamt about. He takes the time to sit down and go over any questions or concerns. Very professional encounter and if you are looking for a DJ for any event. This is your guy!

Actually, I did not get a DJ, but rented a receiver, microphone, and two large speakers from Hi-Tech Audio and Sound, and plugged in my iPod to play my own playlist. Everything worked out very well. The company was very flexible, as there were wildfires in the area, and the road was closed, so I was not able to return the equipment on the day I was supposed to, but they understood, and I was not charged extra or anything.

We had a great experience with Joe's DJ! They were professional with setup and worked closely with us to get the audio just right for our ceremony and reception. AJ went above & beyond to work with us to make sure we could have a recording of the ceremony audio as well. There were no hiccups with the ceremony music, and everything went smoothly. The lights were a fun add-on that made the dance floor even better, and our DJ did a fantastic job reading the room and keeping the energy up all night. Highly recommend!

We had such a great experience working with John! We only had to give him very minimal direction with what kind of music we liked and he did an amazing job reading the crowd and selecting music that got everyone up and dancing. Of course he also took guest requests and made sure he played all the music we requested for special dances and such, but he’s definitely a DJ with a lot of experience and working with him can ensure a good time!
