Our wedding day at Allrose Farm was absolutely perfect, we could not have dreamed for it to be any better or go more smoothly! The decor really looked amazing and the whole venue is just so beautiful! Our guests could not stop ranting and raving about how good the food was (HUGE SHOUTOUT TO WOODLAND HONEY CATERING) and how awesome the venue was! They all said it was the best wedding they have been to! The staff were all wonderful to work with and I would 10/10 recommend to everyone looking for the perfect wedding venue! The barn being entirely wood and the fireplace the sweetheart table sits in front of is absolutely perfect! The land that the barn sits on is also beautiful and had plenty of spots for photos! The bridal suit was spacious and attached to the barn so it was super convenient! Our experience at Allrose Farm & Woodland Honey Catering was spectacular and it made our big day even more memorable!

The Brussel was fantastic from start to finish - we got passed appetizers, grazing table, plated meals, and dessert for our fall, barn style wedding. The price was so reasonable and the food was DELICIOUS! Really 10/10. They tailored our order to exactly what we wanted - a fall-themed menu. We had turkey cranberry sliders to start, among other things, and even an apple cider donut bar to end the night. When they say custom catering, that is really true. The Brussel will make whatever you ask for! I highly recommend Emily and her team - the service was seamless and everything went so well. They even had the cutest vintage china setup for the plated meal!

Magic Foods Catering is a must hire! The food was insanely delicious and amazing quality and quantity. We visited their restaurant O'Bistro in Wolfboro to taste their food and we fell in love with a chicken dish that wasn't on their catering menu. They were beyond accommodating and were able to put that chicken dish on our wedding menu and a beautiful steak. Many people commented on the quality of the food and for those that judge a wedding by the food, Magic Foods did not disappoint. They also were able to create our wedding cake and mini desserts, which were equally delicious! Highly recommend them!

The Red Blazer Bakery made 10 pies for my wedding (7 flavors) and did an amazing job! My husband and I are not really cake people and were so excited to have all of those flavors and options for our big day. Everything was delivered on time and without any issue and all of the pies presented gorgeously. We continue to hear wonderful feedback from our guests. Thank you!

I can’t say enough good things about White Apron as the caterer for our wedding. The food and the service on the day of was unbelievably amazing. Our wedding was tented on the ocean and a kitchen had to be built, which they executed flawlessly. Not only was the experience on the wedding day wonderful, but our family still talks about the day of our tasting. Jay and his team made it a one of a kind experience. It was after that we knew we made the right choice hiring White Apron. If you are looking for 5 star food & service, look no further than this team

Chill catering catered my wedding in Portland Maine and it was fantastic! Their team (specifically Jessica) are so kind, friendly, and easy to work with. They were really flexible and helped me make a menu that fit all of my guests' needs. The food was so good that I had to come visit the Roundabout Diner after my wedding to have those steak tips again!

Chef Joe's was one of our favorite vendors from our wedding. They were so amazing from the minute we reached out up until the end of our wedding night. Mora went through endless menu options with us and was completely professional and pleasant the entire time. She was flexible and tried to make sure that we were happy with our final menu selections. They were also more affordable than the dozen + other caterers in NH that I reached out to and were willing to work with us on the menu to adjust it to fit our budget. They were super accommodating to me wanting the appetizer display to be set out on boards in-between ladders even though they had never set up like that before. They completely nailed the display! Most importantly the food was AMAZING!! Our guests were obsessed with the food and still talk about the Korean Short Ribs 5 months later! All of the waitstaff at our wedding were incredibly friendly and professional. We could not recommend Chef Joe's enough. If you are looking for a wedding caterer, reach out to Chef Joe's, we guarantee they will go above and beyond your expectations!!
