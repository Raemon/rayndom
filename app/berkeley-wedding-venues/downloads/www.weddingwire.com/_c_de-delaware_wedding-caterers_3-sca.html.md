Big fish has great food-that’s a given. But with so many things on a bride’s plate (pun intended ), what made this caterer stand out was their responsiveness, communication and experienced staff. Susan was so helpful working out the menu and even offered timeline suggestions for this clueless bride/wedding planner. And Ashley and her staff ran a seamless show allowing me to focus on the wedding and not worry about anything. Thanks Big Fish team!

Taste Events catered our wedding and we truly could not have asked for a better experience. The food was absolutely incredible — so many of our guests are still talking about how amazing everything tasted. From cocktail hour to dinner, every detail was executed perfectly and felt thoughtful, elevated, and delicious. Hiring Katie as our day-of coordinator was an absolute must and one of the best decisions we made. Katie was beyond amazing — calm, organized, and completely on top of every detail. She made the entire day feel seamless and stress-free, allowing us to actually relax and enjoy our wedding. Any question, issue, or last-minute change was handled before we even knew it existed. Taste Events exceeded our expectations in every way. If you’re considering them for your wedding or event, do it — you will be so glad you did!

My husband and I recently hosted our wedding reception at the Baycenter and we couldn't be more thankful for Marybeth and her staff for such a wonderful weekend. Planning our event with Marybeth was a breeze - she was very responsive to all my questions (via email or text) and she truly treated us as if we were guests in her home. You can tell she is well-respected at the Hyatt and aims to please everyone who hosts an event at the venue. Our cocktail hour was in the Cove (first level of the venue) with the reception upstairs in the Baycenter. The Cove recently received some cosmetic updates (new paint on the walls and bar) and looks great! The Baycenter, at first sight, is a little outdated but can definitely be spruced up for your wedding. We added uplighting around the perimeter of the room and draped the sound booth that awkwardly sits toward the back of the room. Once the room was all setup with the tables, chairs, linens and centerpieces, it was beautiful. Not to mention, you can't beat the views of the bay (especially at sunset). Our guests raved about the food at both cocktail hour and reception. At the end of the night, our decorations were nicely packed up for us and our gifts were safely transported to our condo at the Hyatt. Overall, we couldn't have been happier with our experience and would recommend the Baycenter to anyone!

Ron and the team at Jimmy's Grille were AMAZING for our wedding. Due to near constant changes with COVID, many last minute alterations had to be made for the wedding food and the Jimmy's team was BEYOND FLEXIBLE! It was so helpful that they were open to any and all changes that needed to be made. Not to mention the food was DELICIOUS!! We had many guests reach out to us asking about our catering company, as they said the food was the best wedding food they had had in a long time. We have a few family members and friends who are vegan and gluten free and the chef with the Jimmy's team worked closely with me to create an entree option that was both scrumptious and met the dietary restrictions of our guests. I simply cannot say enough about this group!!

We had a very detailed wedding, so it’s no surprise that Toscana was detailed, coordinated and appropriate for Estefani and I every step of the way for our wedding for our food, which of course was nothing short of exquisite. We went with a planned full course served dinner and don’t regret a single thing. Our guests were simply shocked at the modern and hip appetizers, and amazing full course meal that accompanied our wedding. Special shout out to the manager Lori as she is truly amazing and went above and beyond to be sure our guests were satisfied every hour on the hour, and every step of the way. If you’re looking for a good recommendation for catering, Toscana is simply the best way to go. We would love to give them a 10/10, but we think with the amount of detail we had for our wedding we’ll grant a full 100/100!

We decided to have a chocolate fountain at our reception and we are so happy that we did. The chocolate fountain was visually appealing and a HUGE hit with all the guests. Another Fine Mess was a pleasure to work with and they do all the set-up, serving and take down. David (the owner) was so much help and responded to my emails within hours. I highly recommend Another Fine Mess for all weddings and events near Ocean City, MD.

Maryann and Chuck at La Chateau Gourmet were wonderful! They are the sole caterer for Talleyville Fire Company (which turned out to be beautiful!) They were willing to work with every idea or request that I had. They were also our contact for the rental of chair covers and bows. Every bow was tied perfectly and every place setting was exactly as I requested! The food was also wonderful and reasonably priced. Maryann also did a wonderful job working with all of my other vendors to ensure that all of the events during the reception ran on time and orderly. I highly reccomend working with this vendor they made my wedding day a success!
