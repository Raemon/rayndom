¡Nuestro día fue perfecto! No tenemos palabras suficientes para agradecer todo lo que Rosalina hizo por nosotros. Supo entender nuestra visión, nos guió en cada paso del proceso y se encargó de absolutamente todo con profesionalismo, cariño y una atención al detalle impresionante. Desde las primeras reuniones hasta el gran día, Rosalina nos hizo sentir tranquilos y confiados. Siempre estuvo disponible, con las mejores recomendaciones y una solución para todo. Se aseguró que nuestra boda fuera tal como la soñamos. El día de nuestra boda, ella y su equipo se encargaron de que tanto nosotros como nuestros invitados estuviéramos relajados, bien atendidos y disfrutando de cada momento. Todo fluyó con naturalidad, sin ningún inconveniente, y el resultado fue un día hermoso, emotivo y lleno de momentos inolvidables. ¡Gracias por hacer nuestro sueño realidad, Rosalina!

Como coordinadora de boda y eventos, desde el primer contacto con su equipo hasta el día del evento, su comunicación, organización y profesionalismo han sido excepcional. Su servicio con los niños, el cual es una responsabilidad enorme es confiable. Son responsables, dedicados y totalmente comprometidos con lo que hacen. Los padres quedan encantados y los niños se divierten muchísimo con las actividades de acuerdo a las edades . Este servicio agrega un valor al evento, permitiendo a los padres disfruten plenamente de la celebración, sabiendo que sus hilos están felices y seguros. Lo recomiendo 200 %

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Cuca Gesualdo Weddings &amp; Events ❤️ Truly a Blessing Words cannot fully express how grateful we are for Cuca. From the very beginning, she was professional, caring, and incredibly reassuring. Planning a wedding in Puerto Rico came with language barriers that became overwhelming for me, to the point where I was ready to cancel the entire wedding out of pure emotion and stress. In that moment, Cuca and her daughter stepped in with such compassion, patience, and confidence. They calmed my fears, reassured me that everything would be okay, and truly carried us through. Their support meant everything to us. Because of them, our wedding day was absolutely beautiful, smooth, joyful, and filled with love. What could have been a heartbreaking experience turned into one of the most meaningful days of our lives. We would not have been able to get married in Puerto Rico without Cuca’s guidance and care. If you are looking for someone who is not only talented and professional but genuinely invested in your peace and happiness, Cuca is the one. We are forever grateful. ❤️ Mr. &amp; Mrs. Jerrod and Helena Fish

Working with Karen was truly one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. As a same-sex couple from Washington, DC planning a destination wedding in San Juan, Puerto Rico, we knew we needed someone experienced, supportive, and connected—and Karen was all that and more. From the very beginning, she was incredibly responsive and approachable. No matter the question or concern, she was always quick to reply with kindness and reassurance. Her friendly, calm demeanor made the entire planning process feel so much easier and more enjoyable. Karen has fantastic relationships with top vendors in Puerto Rico, which meant we had access to a trusted network of professionals who brought our vision to life beautifully. Every detail was thoughtfully executed, and we truly felt like we were in the best hands throughout. Our wedding day was more than we could have imagined, and we owe so much of that to Karen’s dedication and talent. We’re honestly sad it’s over—we loved working with her that much! If you're planning a wedding in Puerto Rico, do yourself a favor and hire Karen. She’s amazing!

Liliana and Cristina went above and beyond in both the planning and execution of my wedding. The planning process was so smooth and took little effort on my part because they led me through each step. They helped me make decisions and pushed me in the right direction knowing what I envisioned for my day. The day came together with no mishaps because they were on top of every single detail. They solved any problems before I even knew they existed. They were kind, professional, calming, and gracious. I couldn’t recommend them more if you are considering a wedding Puerto Rico!

We feel incredibly lucky to have found Sari as our wedding planner. Planning a wedding from another continent could have been overwhelming — my husband is American, and we live in Europe — but Sari made the entire process feel smooth, organized, and stress-free. From the very beginning, she understood and respected our wishes. When I explained that we wanted a small, intimate ceremony followed by a simple reception dinner, she immediately knew how to bring that vision to life. She clearly outlined every step, sent thoughtful recommendations, kept track of all the details, contacted vendors, confirmed reservations, and was always quick to respond to questions, no matter how small. What stood out most was how supported and heard I felt throughout the process. Sari was incredibly attentive, calm, and reliable, which gave us so much peace of mind while planning from afar. On the day of the wedding, she was a steady, reassuring presence and ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to fully enjoy the moment without worry. I can’t recommend Sari highly enough, especially for couples planning from abroad or anyone looking for a planner who genuinely listens, cares, and executes beautifully. We couldn’t have done this without her.

I honestly don’t even have enough words to describe how incredible Nayas was throughout my entire wedding planning journey! I’ve dreamed of my wedding day since I was a little girl, and she truly made those dreams come to life. I was planning my wedding from the U.S. while she was in Puerto Rico, and you would never know there was any distance because she made everything seamless. From setting up Zoom calls to always being available for any questions, she went above and beyond every single step of the way. The planning platform she provided was amazing and kept everything organized—and honestly, with my crazy work schedule, there would have been NO wedding without her! She gave me the most gentle nudges when I was falling behind and always had such a calming presence, even when things got overwhelming. She took the time to really understand what I wanted and worked hard to make sure it all happened within my budget. Her recommendations were spot-on, and she helped me prioritize so that I could add things later if I wanted. If we had phone meetings with vendors, she was there and was able to describe my vision better than me! When I wasn’t sure about certain details, she gave me options and guidance without ever making me feel pressured. For example, I didn’t think I wanted to pay for a videographer, but she suggested an alternative amazing vendor who captured incredible moments without breaking the bank. On my wedding day, she kept me calm, kept everything on track, and coordinated every single detail to perfection. The vendors she connected me with were top-tier! My husband and family honestly thought I spent way more than I did because everything looked and felt so amazing. Everyone is still telling me it was the best wedding they’ve ever been to! My husband was not involved with the planning (I didn’t let him) and he has praising about Nayas and her team. He is hard to impress and he was blown away by her. He appreciated her working with me. I can truly say my wedding dreams came true because of Nayas. If you’re a bride—whether you’re local or planning from afar—run, don’t walk, and hire her. She will advocate for your vision and make sure it becomes a reality. I can’t recommend her enough! She really became my Fairy Godmother and I am just so beyond pleased! 💕🥰🫶🏽

Ricardo, su equipo y sus suplidores son los mejores. El día de mi boda no tuve que estar pendiente ni dar seguimiento a absolutamente nada: él se encargó de cada detalle a la perfección. Confié en él al 100% y superó todas mis expectativas. Todo lo que teníamos en nuestra lista se cumplió, y además hizo mucho más para que nuestro día fuera verdaderamente perfecto. El mejor coordinador. ¡Lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados! I cannot recommend Ricardo, his team, and his suppliers enough. On my wedding day, I didn’t have to monitor or follow up on a single thing—he handled every detail flawlessly. I trusted him 100%, and he delivered beyond every expectation. Everything on our list was completed, and he even went above and beyond to make the day absolutely perfect. I truly couldn’t have asked for a better planner. Highly, highly recommend!

We really could not have asked for a better person to support us through our destination wedding process! Aida made time for us in person & via Zoom so that we would be at ease & no small detail would be forgotten. She helped us to stay on task even through stressful times. She helped us assemble a wonderful team of vendors that each provided extraordinary customer service & quality work. She made sure any challenges we experienced we overcame them & had the most beautiful wedding experience! Our wedding day turned out so incredibly beautiful thanks to Aida & all of her support! Would highly recommend her as your wedding planner!
