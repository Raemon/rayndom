"This is the best day of your life" is something Gene Prentice from the Maine Classic Car Museum stated over and over again, from day 1, and throughout the 16-month wedding planning process. The idea of getting married at a car museum is a little out of the norm for some, but me having grown up around classic cars with my now 76 year old father and my husband sharing the same love with his late father, we knew it was the perfect venue for our wedding on 8/23/2025. Incorporating this love for cars and many memories for both of us was so very special. Having my dad walk me down the aisle and marrying my best friend inside the museum is something I will never forget. We are so appreciative of the accommodations that were made to bring all of our hopes and dreams for this event to fruition (including a 30X70' structure tent over the courtyard!). What resulted from all the help and attention to detail was the most amazing wedding our family and friends have ever been to. We are so grateful to Gene, his staff, and all the wonderful vendors for giving us the BEST day of our lives! This venue is a hidden gem, truly one of a kind, and I believe many of our guests will come back as visitors for years to come! I know we will!

Ashely is so great, absolute life saver. Communication was smooth and reply’s were fairly quick. Set up was smooth and they’re willing to work with you. Just about everything was rented through Wallace. The inside is perfect for the reception and dancing. It is definitely too small for dinner, unless you have under 75 people about. The bathroom situation is great. For the reception, there are lots of places to pick from. Perfect venue to break up and make it feel like different locations all in one. Clean and professional!
