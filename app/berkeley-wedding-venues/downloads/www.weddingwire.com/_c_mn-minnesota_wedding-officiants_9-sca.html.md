Mike was great! He was on time, professional and open to whatever level of involvement we needed from him. Good communication beforehand and great preparation. We had a script, and he followed it well, and he brought some humor and fun to the ceremony and really the whole process. Then he was adaptable to the challenges of our outdoor wedding on the day of. He was the best person to have there that day and to help my husband and I start our life together! Calm and collected, you can tell he has seen quite a few weddings in his time! We really enjoyed working with Mike!!

John from Timeless Tributes understood exactly what we wanted. He was always there to answer our questions and he reached out with his own questions. He put together a ceremony that represented us. He was very polite, kind and has a way with his words that was meaningful to us. I would highly recommend him to friends and family.

Jenn from Blessings by Bartlett was absolutely amazing. She made our ceremony deeply personal and meaningful, and she supported us every step of the way. She was professional, warm, and reassuring. Our guests said it was the best ceremony they’ve ever heard — all thanks to her. Highly recommend!

Tom was such a delight to work with! From our first phone call we knew we were in good hands. He was personable, warm, knowledgable, and prompt. Tom has a plethora of resources on his website in order to curate a ceremony that feels personal and just right. He is incredibly detailed and offers a lot guidance throughout the process so that the day of everything flows seamlessly. We highly recommend him!

Kjersti officiated our little vow renewal in a beautiful park for my husband and I. It was a lovely ceremony and Kjersti was wonderful to talk to. It was a sweet and memorable vow renewal thanks to her!

Working with Annette and her Team was the best choice for our wedding and we are so happy with how the day turned out! Annette is so knowledgable and it truly feels like she cares about making it the most perfect experience. My husband and I did not want a long engagement. We reached out to Annette within a few months of when we wanted to marry and she was able to set up a beautiful wedding, while keeping the process simple and fun. We had minimal stressors and Annette would respond within hours when we had any questions or concerns, no matter the time or day. We wanted a small wedding along the North Shore and looked into Annette’s micro wedding package. This included planning/coordination, chairs and arch set up and tear down, officiant, music/speakers, a customizable small wedding cake with utensils, sparkling juice toast, customizable flowers for bride and groom (which were beautiful we got so many compliments!), and 2-hours of photography. We were able to chose from multiple photographers who were available during our day and spoke to them beforehand for planning. We had around 15 guests, but I recall more chairs are available. We also added on videography which we 100% recommend. The group Annette works with was amazing and we are so happy with the videos received. Annette had a list of spots we could chose from, or she was open to someplace we may find. We chose a State Park and Annette met with us there to find the perfect spot overlooking Lake Superior. Our officiant, Jean, was great to work with! We looked through pages of ceremony examples to pick and chose what we wanted said at our ceremony. We sent songs to walk down to and even had our first dance after the ceremony. Cost was upfront and easy to navigate on her website, with payments spread out. Annette and her Team thought of every detail and made sure it was executed to make it seamless for us. We appreciated how easy the process of planning was, and how day of we showed up to a beautiful set up and did not have to worry about all the specific details. Annette truly made our day so special and we would not change a thing!

We could not imagine a better person to share our special day with! From start to finish, she was easy to work with, enthusiastic, and used her experience to adapt to any situation and make it great! Within the first few minutes of talking to Amy, we knew she was the person we wanted to marry us, and we couldn't be happier that we picked her. Although we may have only met with her a few times beforehand, she made it feel as though we had a family member marrying us. If you are considering Amy, we promise you won't regret it!
