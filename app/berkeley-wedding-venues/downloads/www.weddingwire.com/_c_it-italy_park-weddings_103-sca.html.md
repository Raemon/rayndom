Our experience at Borgo Iesolana exceeded all expectations at every turn! Starting with the planning, from the U.S., Michela was wonderful! The venue is simply gorgeous, all of the food (breakfast, restaurant, celebration meals, etc etc) was amazing (kudos to the chef!), the accommodations are modern and comfortable, the vendors recommended were perfect and the staff were fantastic. The wedding weekend was simply magical, for us and our guests!

Riseccoli as a wedding venue was everything we needed for a small wedding party of around 40 people. The staff are so lovely and go out of their way to make everything as smooth as possible. The villas that can be rented for guests are spacious and beautifully designed (although definitely rustic rather than modern). Riseccoli put us in touch with Licinia Spataro for planning who was faultless in putting together all the vendors and making the day great. Riseccoli, in combination with catering from Il Sorisso and others made it an absolutely perfect day. The wine is also fantastic!

The baglio has a unique soul. The heart of the experience is the combination of everything: the history of the house, the charm of Sergio playing in the gardens, and Giovanna's welcome. Liubov's genuine breakfasts are a treasure not to be missed and make you start your day with a smile
