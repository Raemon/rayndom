Working with [Name] was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. She is exceptionally organized, communicative, and genuinely cares about her couples. From planning logistics to day-of execution, everything was handled with care and precision. We were able to fully enjoy our day because we knew we were in such capable hands. I would highly recommend her to anyone wanting a smooth, beautiful, and thoughtfully planned wedding.

The level of professionalism and attention to detail Kevin brought in planning our daughter’s wedding is unmatched. He made her vision come to life and executed every detail perfectly. Along the way, he found additional ways and ideas to enhance the design and created a schedule to ensure the day went smoothly. We enjoyed our meetings with him. Kevin truly cares about his clients and plans every detail like it was is own wedding. We cannot thank him enough for helping to plan a beautiful wedding!

Sondra was incredible! We never been to the Outer Banks so hiring a planner was a must. She was kind and patient throughout the whole process. She recommended the best vendors and together they gave us the wedding of our dreams! If you are looking for a stress free wedding day I highly recommend her!

Summer and the Firefly team really made our wedding the best day! I made unique/specific requests throughout the process, and Summer always rolled with my vision, providing opinions and navigating challenges with professionalism. The day of was truly perfect, I didn't lift a finger and the table settings, ceremony music, multiple locations/shuttles, and food all went off without a hitch. I HIGHLY recommend this team. She also counseled me through the potential for rain during an outdoor spring wedding, and while we were lucky not to have it, we were fully prepared for the possibility.

I cannot say enough good things about Christina and Kristy! They responded to my many questions in a timely manner, and went out of their way to make sure my wedding day was everything I had ever dreamed. With all her experience, Christina knew what questions to ask vendors to make sure I was getting the best deals in my contracts. Kristy helped me to visualize my wedding by creating the room layout when my venue manager failed to do so. During the wedding day, they both made sure that I was not bothered with questions from vendors, and that everything ran smoothly. It was honestly the best day ever and I'm so glad that I got to work with them!

Literally the best planners I could have worked with. Lisa and Valerie were AMAZING. Responded quickly about anything, so sweet, planned our wedding so well and everything went so smoothly and I wasn’t stressed because of them. They nailed down every detail to a tea and took care of so much. They have so much great experience, knowledge, and are super professional. On top of that, they are such great people. 100% recommend!!

If you are a review reader I hope you read my gush8ing review on google. These guhys are the REAL DEAL. They make the wedding planning process so much easier! Working with Heather, Mia and Cole was so much fun. Always responsive and helped me work through a lot of difficult venue problems!! I was an out of town bride and having Heather as my boots on the ground saved my wedding and my sanity! They gave us the wedding of our dreams!! BOOK THEM!

My husband wanted a wedding planner and I was hesitant because I was trying to save money, but let me tell you.... I do NOT regret getting Beth as our wedding planner! She calmed my nerves during the entire wedding planning process which helped keep me sane. I loved how much knowledge she has in the Outer Banks wedding industry. I truly believe that is the reason our wedding day turned out perfectly. She made sure I had every little detail down to a tee. I did not think of half the things she reminded me of! My husband and I are so thankful for Beth and her team! Our day was so smooth because of them. 10/10!

As I was planning a wedding from out of town, I wanted to find a coordinator who could steer me towards local Asheville vendors while also staying in my budget. I was immediately put at ease during my consult phone call with Kiersa. Even before we selected her as our coordinator, she provided me with some vendor lists and contacts so we could fully research before making our decision. She was very thoughtful and understanding when planning our zoom meetings around my work schedule and was able to meet and plan with vendors while my now husband and I were at work! Her extensive experience at the Biltmore and Asheville led to the most beautiful and stress free wedding day!

Nicole is an angel on earth! We can’t recommend her enough. She was extremely communicative & prompt throughout the entire process pre-wedding, & absolutely knocked it out of the park on wedding day. Her & her team (Elizabeth & Ava, also amazing) at Premier Party Planners made sure our wedding weekend ran so smoothly, & all while smiling & being so warm & kind. Coming from a type-A-control-freak-bride, I am SO thankful that I didn’t have to lift a finger day-of, & I was able to relax & truly enjoy our wedding day, with full confidence knowing Nicole was running the show. If you’re reading this & debating whether a planner or coordinator is worth it, or whether PPP is the right team for you, do it!! You’ve come to the right place. Worth every penny (& much, much more) to have Nicole & PPP on board your wedding vendor team! Being able to fully enjoy my wedding day while someone else handles it all was absolutely PRICELESS.
