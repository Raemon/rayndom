Beautiful venue and amazing staff

We recently celebrated our engagement ceremony at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel, Berkeley Marina, and it was an absolute dream come true! From the moment we began planning, the entire team at DoubleTree went above and beyond to ensure every detail was perfect for our special day.  
  
Their level of cooperation and collaboration was unparalleled. They worked tirelessly with us, listening attentively to our ideas and desires, and offering valuable insights to make our event truly unforgettable. No detail was too small for them to handle, and their dedication to excellence was evident in every aspect of the planning process.  
  
On the day of the event, we were blown away by the professionalism and warmth of the staff. From the event coordinators to the servers, everyone treated us and our guests with the utmost care and respect. They anticipated our needs before we even had to ask, ensuring that everything ran smoothly from start to finish.  
  
The venue itself was stunning, with breathtaking views of the Berkeley Marina that provided the perfect backdrop for our celebration. The atmosphere was elegant yet inviting, creating the ideal setting for our special day.  
  
We cannot thank the DoubleTree Hilton team enough for their outstanding service and hospitality. They truly exceeded our expectations in every way possible, and we feel incredibly grateful to have chosen them for our engagement ceremony. We wholeheartedly recommend DoubleTree Hilton, Berkeley Marina to anyone seeking a truly exceptional event experience

Incredible experience. Professional, flexible, and attentive.

We had the absolute best experience hosting our wedding here. Natasha Norman was incredible to work with through the entire planning process. She was clear on pricing, set our expectations well, was incredibly responsive, and helped coordinate the event on the day of the wedding. We asked for some extra time to set up the room and, since the room hadn't been booked the day before the event, she let us come in the day prior to get everything in order. Natasha spoke with our DJ and coordinated for his set-up, which was very helpful. The team setting up the event also did the perfect job of setting up the tables and outdoor chairs exactly as we'd asked. I changed my mind on the arch at the last minute, and they had no problem making the change. The wedding was incredible, our guests felt comfortable in their rooms and were pleased they could bring their dogs so they didn't have to hire a dog-sitter. Everyone was impressed by the view and by the fact that the sun was setting behind the sweetheart table in the Bayview Ballroom. I also want to give a shoutout to the banquet manager who made us feel at home, kindly brought us beverages as we were setting up, and took care of us throughout the stay. I’ve received at least half a dozen compliments on the qualify of the food served, and I felt the pricing was very reasonable – especially when compared to other hotels on the water nearby. I also loved that the hotel provided us a contingency plan if we needed to move our outdoor wedding to the indoors because of rain or anything else. We truly felt special and valued and would use this venue again in a heartbeat.

Beautiful Venue at the Marina & Excellent Events Director 

We thoroughly enjoyed having our wedding at the DoubleTree in Berkeley Marina. Natasha Norman was our main point of contact all throughout the process and she was phenomenal. She was kind, helpful, professional and communicative right from the start. She worked with us to plan and organize our micro wedding of 11, and helped our families get the best accommodations during their stay. She patiently provided consistent and clear details about the package options and worked hard to make sure we got everything we wanted and needed for our wedding. She also communicated with our vendors and ensured that the set-up process on the day of went smoothly, which helped to relieve a lot of stress. We could not have been happier with how it went. The breakfast staff also offered us standout service - they even helped us get breakfast for our party 10 minutes before the breakfast time ended.   
The entire venue space is perfect for a wedding (whether it's outdoors or in). We'd originally planned for everything to be outside, as it's a beautiful outdoor spot, but it was forecasted to rain. Even though we ended up in the ballroom, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise - the floor-length windows ensured that we still got a beautiful view of the marina and lots of natural light, and it was spacious enough for all of our activities (ceremony, cocktail hour and dinner). Our families were very pleased with the event, as well as with their stay. It was also very helpful to have the bridal suite & connecting room the night before the wedding - and having one complimentary night included in our package was even better. Overall, it's high value and quite affordable for all that you get in their packages. Highly recommend!

They saved the day for our rehearsal dinner!!

Natasha Norman and the Berkeley Boathouse truly saved the day! My husband and I were originally supposed to be married in May 2020 (you obviously know how that went…or DIDN’T go more importantly!) We initially had a different venue for our rehearsal dinner for our ‘original’ wedding, and they had honestly been a bit difficult and unreliable to work with even pre-pandemic. We were very fortunate to see the writing on the wall in March 2020 and decided to push our wedding out to October 16th, 2021 and were able to retain our venue and all vendors. However, when our new date began inching closer, we found our initial rehearsal dinner venue was even more unreliable and non-communicative than pre-pandemic!! That venue eventually fell through completely and so I decided to reach out to the Berkeley Boathouse restaurant at The Doubletree by Hilton Berkeley Marina, as this hotel was where myself + groom, much of the wedding party, and many guests were already staying. Natasha (Director of Catering & Conference Services) responded quickly and offered a tour of the restaurant and introduction to options. My MIL and I toured and found the restaurant to be absolutely beautiful and Natasha did a wonderful job of working with us to feel comfortable with a budget proposal. We decided almost instantly after our meeting that this was the place! The night of, I was delighted to see Natasha there to greet us at the start of our event! She was warm, welcoming, and extremely professional throughout the entire planning process. Our night went absolutely perfectly- the bartender was friendly and wonderful with our guests, the DIY taco bar was a hit, and guests could not get enough of the unbelievable October sunset from the venue (it was so beautiful everyone went outside for pictures!) I could not have been happier with how the event turned out.  
  
In terms of the hotel itself, the rooms were comfortable and clean, staff friendly and helpful, and the hotel and the location are just beautiful! We had many waterfront morning coffee walks and enjoyed the gorgeous views. Side note, staying in the hotel for several days means I had several meals at the Boathouse, and the food and service were excellent!

Venue, Coordinator and more!

My sister had her wedding reception at Double Tree by Hilton Berkeley Marina on 9/18/2021 and worked with Natasha Norman. Not only was the location and the venue beautiful, Natasha and her team really made her day was one that everyone will remember for a long time. From making sure everyone was taken care of with the room blocks, reserving/cancelling reservations (I can't even tell you how many times people called/emailed her to do this), Natasha was very patient with us and made sure everything went without a hitch. She was there for the rehearsal dinner and was there for the wedding itself making sure that every detail was perfect. You can tell that this team values their customers because they made sure every need we had was met, from asking to be let in to the ballroom the night before so we can do final touches for the displays to requesting drinks and extra food, they truly cared about our experience as customers. Rose made sure our food and drinks were prepared to perfection and Angela from housekeeping made sure our rooms were perfect. You will not regret working with this team! Thank you Natasha and team for a job well done!

An exquisite and beautiful place to have your wedding and/or reception

Down by the Berkeley Marina you will find The Doubletree by Hilton where it sits with great views of the marina and San Francisco Bay Area. The hotel and venue is staffed with professionals that know what they are doing, and are great at what they do.  
  
My wife and I decided to have our wedding reception and rehearsal dinner at The Doubletree, and that was the best choice we have made. What we got was an exquisite and beautiful reception for our wedding day. We had the pleasure of working with Natasha Norman and she is the greatest. From the time we decided to book with The Doubletree to our big day, she was with us the entire way. She was extremely professional, attentive, kind, helpful, understanding, and the list goes on. We had a vision when planning our wedding, and Natasha made sure that vision was put to life on our big day. Everything went well and was above our expectations. We also had the pleasure of working with Rose during our rehearsal dinner and during our reception dinner. She is fun, bright and energetic. We enjoyed having her.   
  
Having fun, professional, and energetic staff is essential to having a fun successful event, and you will find that here at The Doubletree by Hilton Berkeley Marina. My wife and I look back and reminisce our big day, and it everything about it was so great and beautiful.  
  
The venue itself is very well placed at it's location with great views of the marina. It also makes for great photo opportunities which we were able to take advantage of with the beautiful sunset. We were able to have our cocktail hour outside which we filled with our family and friends, and this created a great atmosphere filled with extreme joy.  
  
The food for the rehearsal and dinner was great. We carefully picked the menu from their outstanding chef that prepared the meals for our guest, and everyone enjoyed the food and drinks.  
  
The hotel itself is great to stay at since we were able to get ready for our big day and stay the night afterwards. Spacious and clean rooms as expected. We were also able to setup a room block for our family and friends so that they can party with us all night and stay afterwards.  
  
Overall, my wife and I highly recommend The Doubletree by Hilton Berkeley Marina. Everything about this place was great and checked off all of our wants and needs for our big day. Natasha along with her staff were great and we couldn't have had a better team.

Indian wedding - flawlessly executed!

I am so happy to have had DoubleTree Berkeley Marina host our Indian wedding celebrations and prewedding events. The staff at DoubleTree were readily available to assist us during all of our events, and made sure we didn’t miss anything. They were organized, and helped our planner make decisions on little details involved with each ceremony to ensure everything would go as planned. Special shoutout to Natasha Norman for being so patient and so accommodating! She went the extra mile for us on so many occasions. She even accepted my hair floral deliveries and made sure they were refrigerated and kept fresh for our events! This is just one example of the amount of support we had for even the smallest things! With their help, our events were seamlessly executed, and our vision brought to life!  
The bay view ballroom was beautiful, airy, and a perfect place to have our sangeet and mendhi (prewedding celebration). The floor-to-ceiling windows, with the Marina view provided the perfect unique background to pair with our brightly coloured decor setup. The outdoor venue by the Marina was used for our wedding day, and was the perfect amount of open space for our ceremony and guests. The view was the perfect background for our ceremony stage setup and overall looked breathtaking. Not to mention we had the appropriate amount of privacy from nearby tourists and hotel guests. This was actually an issue for a lot of other outdoor hotel venues we had looked into before that were by the water, so I was very happy with our decision to have the wedding here!   
A lot of our guests were from out of state and out of country, and they felt right at home thanks to the amazing hospitality provided by DoubleTree. Our vendors and their setups were also well accommodated for each event, and the hotel helped ensure their work remained seamless and uninterrupted. I couldn’t imagine celebrating our special day anywhere else!

Highly Recommend Doubletree by Hilton Berkeley Marina

Doubletree by Hilton Berkeley is a wonderful venue to celebrate your Wedding Day. The Venue is in a prime location only about 15-20 minutes from San Francisco and there are amazing photo opportunities of the San Francisco Bay Area during Sunset as your backdrop. The staff there will take care of your every need, especially Natasha, who was there to cater to every need of the Bride and Groom. It was especially helpful for their staff to help set up the decorative items for the Wedding Reception, which doesn't happen at a lot of Wedding Venues. The most important factor was that myself (the Wedding Coordinator), the Bride, and the Groom felt very stress free because Doubletree took care of everything and if we needed something at the last second, they were very quick to take care of that need as well.  
  
I highly recommend the Doubletree by Hilton Berkeley Marina!

Natasha Brown was outstanding in taking the stress from me in planning the Wedding Rehearsal Banquet!!!

We hosted our Daughter's Wedding Rehearsal Luncheon Banquet at the Doubletree and booked all the Wedding Guest who traveled as well; Natasha worked with our budget, guest and time line almost a year in advance during COVID 19! Everytime I spoked to her, she kept me centered and confident that she would take care everything for me. SHE DIDN'T DISSAPOINT, I'M GRATEFUL(-;
