Aaron was the DJ for a private family reunion I attended and I was so IMPRESSED that literally everyone was dancing the entire time! His curation of tracks was just so cool and each transition was just so smooth and seamless, even across different genres of music. I mean it everyone from the kids to the adults to the older folks were grooving and just having the time of their lives. I kept looking up the songs he was playing to save them on Spotify so I could listen to them again. It's so cool to witness such a talented artist with so much joy in what he does. He made our family reunion so special and memorable. I'd love to hire him in the future!

Justin was absolutely phenomenal! From the start and throughout our journey he was very helpful and answered all of our questions in great detail. With the concern of what we like as music vs being respectful to our families he made sure that we were comfortable with everything that was going to happen and succeeded tremendously. The conversations were easy but informative and he made the effort to get to know us as a couple and individually. When we discussed the details of the wedding we were blown away at the amount of detail he incorporated for the music, introductions, announcements and so forth. When the wedding day came we were absolutely blown away with how everything turned out. He even checked in with us when a specific request was made from one of the guests which we really appreciated and that was super respectful of him. The music was perfect AND he even joined in on one of our traditional dances making the wedding even more memorable. We would one million percent recommend anyone and everyone to book DJ Just-IN for any event! We even had several guests tell us that he was one of the best wedding DJs they have experienced. Thank you Justin for making our wedding spectacular with everything you did!

We recently hired Jason to serve as the DJ and MC for our wedding, and he exceeded every expectation. From the beginning, he was consistently professional, organized, and clearly experienced in managing the details of large events. His attention to detail, strong communication skills, and overall professionalism immediately put us at ease. We selected specific songs for key moments and trusted him with the rest. His ability to read the room was exceptional, and multiple guests—including my sister‑in‑law—remarked that it was the best DJ performance they had ever experienced. In addition to his DJ work, Jason coordinated seamlessly with the venue staff to ensure the event flowed smoothly. We had previously seen him perform at other weddings and festivals, and he has always delivered a high‑quality experience. Although our venue offered a list of preferred DJs at a lower rate, we chose to work with Jason even with an added fee—and we would make the same decision again without hesitation

We booked Rob for our wedding and he gave us a discount since he was a preferred vendor by our venue! Rob was professional, accommodating, communicates well, and flexible.

Fantasy Sound Event Services absolutely blew us away and played a crucial role in making our wedding day unforgettable! From the moment we contacted them, they were professional, responsive, and incredibly helpful. We knew we wanted a magical ambiance for our reception, and Fantasy Sound went above and beyond to deliver. They expertly handled the hanging of our string lights and decorative elements, transforming the space into something truly enchanting. The personalized projected monogram on the dance floor was a huge hit and added a unique, personal touch that all our guests commented on. Their team was incredibly hardworking and detail-oriented. They arrived early, worked diligently throughout the setup, and ensured everything was perfect before they left. We wholeheartedly recommend Fantasy Sound Event Services to anyone looking to elevate their wedding or special event. Their dedication, creativity, and execution are unmatched. Thank you, Fantasy Sound, for helping us create such beautiful memories!

DJ Happy (Arnaldo) is the DJ for your event! He is super friendly & organized. We hired him for our wedding and he set us up with his app that allowed us to enter very detailed information about our wedding day timeline so that he knew exactly what the day looked like. He also pivoted to my random taste in music seamlessly! All our guests couldn’t stop raving about how great he was. He made time to meet with us via Zoom multiple times to discuss our wedding day. We didn’t have a coordinator so he gave us valuable insight, based on his many years of experience. Thank again Arnaldo for making our wedding day extra special!

Spencer was fantastic at our wedding at Ardenwood this month! I was drawn to working with Spencer as soon as he presented his planning spreadsheet during our first intro call. I'm already a type-A spreadsheet-obsessed type of bride so to have a DJ already have their own spreadsheet with all of the details outlined and thinking 3 steps ahead, it was a perfect match. With all of the information that we shared, Spencer was able to take that with just about a week of notice (because we were a bit delayed :) ), and executed our entire wedding flawlessly. My biggest priorities for the wedding DJ was keeping the wedding on time and keeping people lit on the dance floor - both of which were achieved. Thank you Spencer!!!

## San Francisco, CA Wedding DJ: How to Find the Right Wedding DJ in San Francisco for your Reception

Everyone knows that San Francisco is gorgeous, romantic, and welcoming, but this city also has a reputation for being pricey. It is, but that doesn't mean you won't find [wedding venues in San Francisco](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/ca-california/san-francisco-san-jose-oakland/wedding-venues/807-11-rca.html) that fit into your Big Day budget. You just have to do a little more research! Getting married in the city of love means your options abound - which can sometimes make it harder to choose a wedding venue and vendors like San Francisco DJs. What's your pleasure? An eco-conscious menu? A rooftop garden reception or a celebration in Golden Gate Park? How about photos in front of the city's famous heart statues? There's so much here that you're sure to find a setting, refreshments, and a wedding DJ you love almost as much as your spouse-to-be.

## How Your Wedding DJ Search Will Begin

Because San Francisco is such a popular place to get married, you should make choosing your venue and vendors a priority - and that's true when you're hiring a wedding DJ or wedding band. Starting your search early ensures that you have time to find a San Francisco DJ service you really love that also fits into your your [wedding budget](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/wedding-budget.html). Remember, San Francisco is pricey so chances are you're going to pay [more than the national average](https://www.weddingwire.com/cost/wedding-dj) for a DJ at your wedding.

They're worth every penny, though! Most San Francisco wedding DJs will do more than just spin tunes at your reception. They'll be the MC for your event, introducing you and your wedding party, and they'll help keep your wedding on track by telling guests when it is time to gather for special events like the cutting of the cake. They'll also set the mood of your reception using music, whether that means playing up tempo music to get guests excited or winding things down at the end of the night.

## Ask Potential Wedding DJs These Questions First

Whenever you talk to San Francisco DJs, have a list of questions to ask handy so you get the information you need to make an informed choice. The first things you should ask about are availability, price, equipment, performance style, and whether a DJ is familiar with your wedding venue. If you're looking for a San Francisco DJ service that can provide extras, ask specifically about lighting rigs, video presentations, photo booths, and props. If you'd prefer your wedding DJ not take requests from guests or play certain songs, make sure you address that directly. And finally, always ask for references because reviews can only tell you so much.

Tip: Keeping track of the San Francisco wedding vendors you've interviewed in a [wedding vendor manager](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/vendor-manager.html) so you never forget which ones you liked best (and least).

## Your Wedding DJ Can Make Your Big Day Amazing

With your help, that is. If your San Francisco wedding DJ will also be acting as MC and keeping guests in the know about photo ops and special moments, you'll need to give them more than a do-not-play list. You can help your DJ keep your reception flowing smoothly by giving them a comprehensive timeline of events and a pronunciation guide for any challenging names in your wedding party. This simple [wedding planning](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning.html) to-do can make a big difference on your Big Day!

Never forget another to-do! WeddingWire has detailed [wedding checklists](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-checklists.html) that lay out all the tasks you'll need to tackle to plan a picture perfect wedding day.
