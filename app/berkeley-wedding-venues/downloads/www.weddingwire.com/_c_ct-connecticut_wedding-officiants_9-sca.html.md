Marie was amazing! From our first phone call, I knew we went with the right choice. She was so knowledgeable in all things wedding. During the ceremony, she kept things lighthearted and funny. It was exactly what we were looking for. Everyone was raving about how great the ceremony was all because of Marie.

Lauri was exceptional from start to finish. She met with us multiple times, took the time to explain our options, and sent us all our ceremony details for our review. The ceremony was a true reflection of us as a couple. I could not have asked for a better experience. Many people commented on how well done the ceremony was.

Rev. Julie was more than accommodating and professional. Her expertise in officiating weddings, as a minister and interfaith. Rev, gave us exactly the type of ceremony we were looking for. I am Jewish and my husband is Catholic, so she was able to combine the beauty of both our traditions. The ceremony was very special and sacred. I would highly recommend working with her.

Being married by Judy was a uniquely magical experience. And she attended to all the details so it was also stress free. We were married in October. Her gardens were resplendent with color. The leaves were at their peak fall display and before we arrived, Judy went out and picked a bouquet of flowers for our occasion which was equally beautiful. We chose to be married with the fall colors as our background but there were many other choices in her gardens. She seamlessly integrated our desired language into the ceremony which made the ceremony uniquely ours, not some cookie-cutter event that could have come out of a crackerjacks box. When the ceremony was over, she had a bottle of Prosecco and a cake waiting for us. She even volunteered to act as the wedding photographer if we wanted to avoid that expense. Finally, when all was said and done, she followed us down to the town clerk and registered the marriage license for us. Within minutes, we walked away with our notarized copies, a happily married couple. Judy made the event a joy to experience and we believe she took as much joy out of our wedding as we did. We couldn’t recommend her highly enough.

Jason officiated our wedding in July and we cannot recommend him enough! He was so responsive after our first inquiry and showed his kindness and professionalism in our consult call. Jason was communicative throughout the months leading up to our wedding and was flexible with our ideas for ceremony. He helped us draft our own vows and helped us with tips and tricks to feel at ease the day of! We got SO MANY compliments on our ceremony. Jason brought the perfect mix of humor and included so many personal details into our ceremony. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. We can't thank Jason enough.

Philip was absolutely amazing as our justice of the peace. From the moment we connected with him, he guided us through the marriage process with such kindness and professionalism, making everything feel easy and stress-free. He went above and beyond to ensure our ceremony was meaningful and personal to us. What really stood out was his warmth and humor. He brought so much joy and lightheartedness to our day, while still keeping the ceremony deeply heartfelt. His words during the ceremony were truly beautiful—full of wisdom about love and marriage. They resonated with us so much, and we know we’ll carry those words with us throughout our life together. We couldn’t have imagined a better person to marry us. Philip made our day unforgettable, and we’re so grateful for his role in our special moment.

Joe was such a fantastic officiant for our wedding on 11/1/2025. He was incredibly invested in our story and making the ceremony as personal as possible for us. He met with us twice via Zoom and we had the fortunate opportunity to meet with him in person prior to our big day. He’s enigmatic and compassionate, has a wonderful sense of humor, and was a pleasure to work with. He took the time to hear about our entire journey, suggested readings, and found us a lovely hand-fasting ceremony. He was extremely prompt in his replies and very reasonably priced. I would highly recommend him again and again!
