Perfect, memorable wedding and venue

Seascape Beach Resort was the perfect choice for our May wedding. Growing up in Santa Cruz, and having a large out of town contingency for the wedding, I wanted to show off the beautiful Santa Cruz landscape. Seascape was an easy choice for that, and we booked it without even seeing it in person (we live on the East Coast now).   
  
From the beginning, the Seascape coordinators, and especially Brittany, were great at communicating via email and phone, and spent lots of time with us for our in-person visits. They were very honest, and also recommended (and helped us choose between) vendors/design choices. Brittany went above and beyond to answer every question/concern and put all of us at ease that everything would run smoothly. She is the ultimate wedding professional!   
  
All of the staff was supportive, professional, and friendly. We also had wonderful, large, and renovated suites to stay in that weekend.   
  
When we were threatened with rainy weather our wedding weekend, Seascape and Brittany went out of their way to make our Plan B rain plans a wonderful option if we needed it. The morning of the wedding, the sun was out but it was cold, so Seascape quickly set up a Plan C indoor/outdoor combo for us that worked perfectly for the ceremony and cocktail hour.   
  
Our guests loved the gorgeous views, and the food too! We’re so lucky to have had Brittany by our side for our wedding experience, and to have the best memories (and photos!) from the most perfect venue.

Amazing Staff, Amazing Venue

Ah, this staff is the best! They drove us around in a golf cart for our first touch, and made sure everyone was taken care of! My ring bearer broke his shoes seconds before the wedding and they came through with helping us tape them back together haha. They made me so relaxed and the complimentary suite on the wedding night came with comp. breakfast and a bottle of champagne, like perfect!

Great place, great staff, great service

As soon as my husband and I walked into Seascape we fell in love with it, and it turned out to be the perfect wedding venue. The staff was extremely nice, responsive, and helpful, and we are so glad we chose Seascape to be our venue. It was raining on our wedding day and we were pretty sure we had to move our ceremony indoors, but the Seascape staff patiently waited with us for about 30 min till the rain stopped, and swiftly moved everything outdoor so we could have our ceremony outside on the bluff, like we had originally planned.

Seascape Resort was such a fantastic Venue for the Ceremony as well as the reception   
Cassandra Curatolo was a great planner/coordinator.  
She worked ever detail, made the total event go with no issues.  
The preferred vendor list was invaluable and was a huge help in the planning & preparation for the event.  
The Venue speaks for itself, the staff was so accommodating  
Words cannot express my wife & I deepest graditude

We got married on 3-17-18 and I can’t say enough good things about Seascape Beach Resort and especially the wedding team! Rachel, Cassandra and Maya were so great to work with. We toured the venue, fell in love with it and officially booked with 105 days till the wedding. It was a lot to do in a short time but working with the wedding team at Seascape made it easy and enjoyable. They were quick to reply to any questions or concerns, never had problems getting ahold of them and they were so helpful. The venue is so beautiful, great views all around the property, and the beach is beautiful. We had a s’mores bonfire the night before our wedding which was a fun way to kick off the weekend with our families. The weather was crazy our wedding weekend but the girls kept checking in with us the week before and during the whole weekend, we went over all of our backup plans and they made sure we were happy with our rain plans which we needed, thankfully not till after the ceremony! We had a buffet dinner and really enjoyed the food both at our menu tasting and the wedding. They made it easy for us to really enjoy our wedding weekend and we are truly happy with how our wedding weekend at Seascape Beach Resort went!

We got married at Seascape in September 2017 and our wedding was perfect! The wedding coordinators were amazing throughout the entire wedding planning process and made our dreams come true on our wedding day.  
We were looking for a ceremony site with the ocean as the backdrop, while keeping our guests sand-free and close to an indoor reception. We couldn't have picked a better venue! The coordinators said that September is the best time of the year in Aptos and they were right. The ocean view and the beach were stunning and the weather was perfect on our wedding day. Our guests still talk about the wow factor when the staff opened the curtains in the Seascape Ballroom at sunset. The food was good too.  
Pretty early on in the planning process, we realized that the coordinators are very on top of everything. It was a huge stress-reliever to not have to worry about the vendor. Maya was our main coordinator and we were so impressed with her capturing our detailed requests both in person and over email. She is extremely knowledgeable and responsive. On the day prior to our wedding, we handed all of our set up decorations/favors/place cards with detailed instructions to Cassandra, who managed to set up everything exactly as we described. She also took the time to laid my train and veil perfectly just before I walked down the aisle and the pictures were gorgeous. As the other reviewers have pointed out, the golf carts are unfortunately difficult to get hold of. We had two time-sensitive situations that needed golf carts and Rachel swooped in and saved us both times. We can't thank the team enough!

My husband and I are so incredibly thankful to have had Seascape Beach Resort as our wedding venue. We searched high and low in the bay area and Los Angeles, and they really just checked all of the boxes. The venue itself is breathtaking (attached some pictures from our wedding to get a sense of the scenery), but what really helped immensely was the quality of the wedding staff. They have a team of coordinators that help coordinate day-of management, also keeping you in line with all of your pending deadlines. They are very responsive to e-mails and phone calls, which was very reassuring and helpful. The food is great (echoed by our guests!), their organization is bar none, and everything came together better than we could have hoped. I would recommend them in a heartbeat!

The Seascape wedding office was fantastic about helping us plan our petite event. Although it was a smaller affair, we were still able to entertain our guests to a delightful ceremony on the patio bluff and an elegant brunch indoors. The wedding office ladies were very helpful with everything, we were able to relax on the actual day and enjoy ourselves.
