## About

Memphis Botanic Garden is a stunning wedding venue located in the heart of Memphis, TN. Featuring 96 acres of specialty gardens, an arboretum, and plenty of indoor and outdoor event spaces, this venue is a beautiful location for weddings of all kinds.

The Garden was first established as Audubon Park in 1947 by Edward Crump and then-mayor Sylvanus Polk out of a desire to develop a sizeable outdoor space in Memphis. Since its inception, the park has grown into a collection of beautiful gardens due to contributions from various benefactors, including the Memphis Area Wildflower Society. The park was renamed Memphis Botanic Garden in 1966 and has served the community as a place to connect with nature since then.

When hosting a wedding at the Garden, there are plenty of options for ceremony and reception sites. You can have your ceremony outdoors in one of the many gorgeous gardens before heading into an indoor reception venue. The largest of the spaces, Hardin Hall, can accommodate up to 350 guests seated at round tables. This space includes a dance floor and access to a romantic terrace. The Goldsmith Room can accommodate up to 150 guests seated and opens up to a beautiful sculpture garden. The most intimate reception venue, Sara's Place, can host 100 guests seated. Regardless of which site you choose, their professional event coordinators will work with you throughout the planning process and provide you with a list of their approved caterers and vendors. Wedding ceremony packages are available and can be either standalone or added to any venue rental. The event staff will take care of the setup, break down, and clean up of included items so that you can relax and enjoy your special day.

Our Rentals team is ready to make your dream a reality; schedule a tour today to find your perfect space at the Garden.

Beautiful Place

There seems to be some problems with the responsiveness of the event coordinator in the past. The current coordinator, Robert, is very responsive to any calls and emails I had in the year leading up to the wedding.   
The Botanic Garden itself is a beautiful venue. There are a lot of places to have lovely pictures taken. We had our ceremony at the Blecken Pavilion and the reception at the Goldsmith Room and Sculpture Garden. There’s a good distance between the 2 places so we were able to rent 2 trams. It was very helpful. I, also, liked that they had certain caterers you had to use. It made it easy to choose one we liked.

Michael with the Botanic Gardens was a huge help and very professional. Our wedding at Sara’s Place at the Botanic Gardens was beautiful.

Dream Wedding Venue

Robert and his team were awesome! They have great communication and various options with the type of wedding you would love.   
The downfall of the venue is the bridal suite needs a major update in decor. I kept bumping my head on the chandelier. I'm only 5'1. Also, they need to update their catering list. Most of the cateres are out of business due to COVID. It's not a lot of options. Besides that it was an amazing wedding for us!

Beautiful scenery 

The scene sets itself! Saved me tons of money on flowers because we literally got married in a beautiful garden! The Blecken and Sara’s Place were amazing! Would definitely recommend!

September Wedding at Blekken Pavilion

We had the pleasure of working with Mr. Robert Stice one of the directors of events at the Memphis Botanic Gardens. Mr. Stice ensured a lot of my wishes came to life. The Botanic Gardens does have a pre approved list of caterers and bartenders but they were easy to book. We ended up using Club Windward for catering and CFY for bartending. Mr. Stice ensured that my brother had direct access to Sara’s Place and a special route for his wheelchair accessible vehicle to be as close to the Blekken Pavillion as possible. Thank you so much for all of your help and helping make my garden wedding dreams come true!

Few venues in the Memphis area have the eclectic flair that MBG has. With their many gardens, you can hold a wedding ceremony that suits your style and set the mood that you are trying to create. Also, they have great options for hosting your reception that are hard to match. Plus, Haley Williams provides so much support for her fellow wedding pros to the point that it would be almost impossible for any of us to fail. She treats you like you are family each and every time, and she is eternally there when you need her. From the board room to the garden grounds, you will have a hard time finding someone there that cannot give you answers to your questions and offer help when you need it. The team here at DeepBlu always enjoys performing at MBG, and we look forward to many more years of working with Haley and her team!
