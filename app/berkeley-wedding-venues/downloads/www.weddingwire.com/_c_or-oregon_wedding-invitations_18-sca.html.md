We ordered a couple different save the date sample magnets with a custom design to get a feel for how they would turn out. The final versions were high quality with rich color! The grande size was perfect and fit snugly in the pre-addressed envelopes which made sending them out so easy. Our friends and family were thrilled to receive them. 10/10 customer service as the vendor worked with us to make sure the order was perfect. Very satisfied!!

I am very pleased with my wedding invitation suite done by Anders Printing! Their graphic design artists are talented and easy to work with. We had a custom illustration of our wedding venue made for invitations and they turned out exactly how we wanted them, and at a great cost too! It was refreshing to be able to go into their brick-and-mortar store to see and feel the printed materials. They are a Portland institution in stationery and design; my parents used them 32 years ago for their wedding invitations, and we were thrilled to get to work with them as well!

Alesia filled out our decorative certificate for our wedding July 17th, 2010. It was so beautiful that we framed it and put it on the table at the wedding where we signed our documents after the wedding. We got so many compliments on it!! My father in law is a minister and married us; when he saw the certificate he was literally moved by it's beauty. He said that it was miraculous what a human hand could do and he found it hard to believe that it had not been done by computer! I wish I could post a picture of it with my review; I want everyone to see it! It hangs in our living room with our wedding pictures and it still makes me smile, weeks after our wedding. =) Mrs. Zorn is creative and amazingly talented. Her communication is excellent and she really caters to her client's wants and needs. She even filled out our witness's blanks as we wished saying "our family and friends" so no one had to sign below her beautiful work. No way to follow such a class act! We highly recommend Alesia Zorn Calligraphy and hope to send many people her way! We love the Bridal Loft and am thankful for the introductions to a great seamstress (Sewing Solutions) and the best make up (Event Cosmetics)!

Oblation knocked our invitations out of the park. The process itself was fun and they were able to tackle any request. As a Graphic Designer, it was super easy to create a layout and design that they then created perfectly. The quality of our final invitation was amazing and is a element of our wedding that we will truly cherish.

I have only ever saved one wedding invitation from the many I have received. It was a beautiful invitation from Lark Press and I knew that I had to have Jean design my wedding invitations. Jean did not dissapoint. She created a beautiful invitation suite using a Japanese kiku design for my wedding and it helped set the theme for the wedding. I loved the invitations so much that I went and got custom earrings made to match the design. Lark Press is very reasonably priced for letterpress and the quality of work that Jean produces. Thank you so much!

I am a digital graphic designer by trade, so I had to have a really slick invite. It can be hard to translate that into Twin Raven's style of hand-cranked embossed paper products - but the end result was simply stunning! Kristin answered all my questions quickly and the process was relatively painless in turning my vision into a lovely invite. She has nearly limitless options of color, texture, opacity, etc - so be sure to have a good idea in mind before starting the process. (I'd recommend pintrest for inspiration - its always best when you can point to something everyone can see and say "like this!") The only thing to fully understand before you choose - - - this is NOT KINKOS - its like the artisanal cousin of a print shop... So you just can't expect super speedy results because this is truly people powered, hand-crank process - not a xerox spitting copies out at a mile a minute. Quality, unique touches, hand-made designs and special requests all take extra time. Do yourself a favor and give yourself and Twin Ravens the extra time they need to excel and help your invite to stand out. Many of our guests observed - "I normally throw out my old wedding invites - but this is so beautiful, I want to keep it forever!" - - - what more could we ask of a printer???
