David handled everything!

I'm no expert in the wedding industry, but David handled everything which made my life so easy! He has great examples on his website of song recommendations and past venues he's played at. I booked online, filled out his music form and that was it. I didn't have to coordinate anything else and all the guests loved him. Our wedding was at the Sheldon so the live piano was perfect for the ceremony

Truly Professional & Talented Musicians!

We are so very thankful to the HämmerString Piano and Cello Duo (+Trio) for bringing such a wonderful ambiance to our wedding day. Having a mix of classical and contemporary music was very important to us as we needed talented musicians that could entertain our guests during our Cocktail Hour, Ceremony and Reception. We were seeking different styles of music for each section of our day, and I loved the versatility of this ensemble.  
  
Dave (piano), Jake (cello) and Brian (percussion) performed wonderfully. We received SO MANY compliments from our guests and I was very impressed with their true professionalism and incredible talent. It is difficult to stop and immerse yourself on your wedding day as there are so many things pulling at your attention, but I was delighted to occasionally stop and truly enjoy the incredible music from the group.  
  
Dave was very accessible and communicative during the planning process, something I appreciated tremendously. The atmosphere and ambiance the group brought to our celebration was loved and appreciated by all.

Great wedding pianist!

We hired Dave to play at our wedding ceremony. He did an amazing job, evening learning a new song, the Rudy theme song, which my groom really wanted to enter to. He was easy to work with from start to finish. There was a wide selection of music to chose from for all parts of our ceremony and even examples as well. I would highly recommend him for any event!

I am so glad we chose Dave to play at our ceremony and reception. Several people said how great of a job they did (we had the cello duo). It only took a few minutes of looking/listening to Dave's website before I knew I wanted to book him. One of the best decisions I made! He also responded to all of my emails extremely quickly, which I liked! And he was so easy to work with! Thank you, Dave, for your beautiful music!

We had David play at both our ceremony and our cocktail hour and could not be more pleased. Everything went exactly as planned. His music set the perfect tone for our event. We asked David and Kim to play two songs that were not on his play list and not only were they accommodating but the songs were made our ceremony so special for us.

I hired David Becherer for my daughter’s wedding. He was professional ( dressed in a suit) he guided us through the process, promptly answered any and all of our questions. We met at his house and he played some pieces for us to help in our selection of music. We had the hammer string duo ( piano and cello). The music was absolutely beautiful. We had family members in church before the ceremony, texting us about how beautiful the music was. So beautiful, the priest asked them to stay afterwards to record a few of their songs. You can’t go wrong with this duo!!
