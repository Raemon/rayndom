We cannot say enough wonderful things about Onteora Mountain House and the incredible team behind it, especially Jeremy and Dylan. Our wedding weekend was nothing short of magical, and a significant part of that is due to the venue's stunning beauty and the exceptional service we received. The pictures simply don't do this place justice. The venue is breathtaking, offering a perfect blend of luxury and rustic charm. The outdoor spaces are simply stunning, providing a picturesque backdrop for our ceremony and reception. Jeremy was incredibly accommodating and flexible throughout the entire planning process. He was always quick to respond to our questions and concerns, and he went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing weekend. The vendors were also very happy to work with the venue team, as they were so attentive and helpful. Dylan and the rest of the team at Onteora Mountain House were attentive and professional throughout the entire weekend. They anticipated our needs and went out of their way to make sure everything ran smoothly. We felt truly pampered and taken care of. If you're looking for a luxury event space with a beautiful, rustic outdoor setting and amazingly attentive staff, we highly recommend Onteora Mountain House. We wouldn't change a thing about our experience there.

What we loved: \+ Beautiful interiors. We wanted a red and gold themed Chinese wedding, and the Ballroom was able to deliver plenty of the gold! The ornate columns made us feel like royals. As one of our guests pointed out, the Western style of the venue's interior blended well with our Chinese decorations, and we loved how the end result seemed to capture our personal identities. Also, the Ladies Tea Room is stunning, though unfortunately we weren't able to find a use for the space in our wedding. \+ Great cause. PGB is run by the non-profit Breaking Ground. Weddings are not cheap, so we loved knowing that our money was going to a good cause \+ Convenient location. Easily accessible by multiple subway lines and a short walk from Penn Station, this venue was easy for our guests to get to. We also loved that it was near Madison Square Park, which ended up being the perfect place to do our first look and take pre-ceremony photos with our wedding party. The day before our wedding, we had our wedding rehearsal at PGB and then walked to the Eataly rooftop for a very romantic rehearsal dinner. \+ Easy to work with. We had no problem scheduling multiple walk-throughs of the space with all our vendors (including the night before our wedding, even though there was a high school prom about to happen!). My husband and I both work late hours, but Serena especially was always available to meet with us on weekday evenings, and she was incredibly sweet and helpful every time. Karen and Serena were both very present the day of our wedding and into the evening to ensure everything went smoothly -- every time we needed either of them, they were there for us Heads up / advice to other brides: \- A very raw production. What didn't register for us until we got deeper into wedding planning was that Prince George Ballroom really is just a space, and that's it. It has a small kitchen, but no tableware/cookware, limited staff, and no special lighting and sound equipment. Ultimately what we saved on venue fees we spent multiples on in audio/visual set up. We had to put all the nuts and bolts together ourselves, which made for more coordination work on our end than had we gone with a restaurant or hotel venue. On the plus side, this meant we were able to customize a lot more to our specific needs (and ultimately got more elaborate lighting options). And thankfully, the staff at Breaking Ground is great to work with. \- Because there is so much color and detail in the space already, you may feel there are more limited color options for flowers / dresses / tables / other decor. It was hard for us to envision whether things would clash with the room -- we really didn't know until we saw it all come together day of. \- Limited catering options. Breaking Ground requires you to select a caterer from their list of 6 or so exclusive vendors. While they ultimately made an exception for us because we requested ethnic catering, they still required us to use Breaking Ground's bartenders (so our caterer's waitstaff couldn't pour alcohol). \- No natural lighting. There are only two small windows but the way they are situated, you get very little to no natural lighting in this space. That was fine for us for the purposes of dinner and dancing, but it would've been nice to have a more sunlit ceremony. Overall we're thrilled with how our wedding turned out and so grateful to Serena and Karen for all their help!!

Brecknock Hall is the best venue to have your wedding at. My husband and I couldn’t imagine having our wedding anywhere else. Valerie and her team are the absolute best and help to make sure everything runs smoothly on your wedding day.

We are so happy we found and chose The Roundhouse for our wedding. The venue was perfect and the staff really knows how to run a wedding flawlessly. We were able to have our Friday night welcome drinks, Saturday reception, and Sunday brunch all on premises in different spaces, which our guests appreciated and made planning much easier. Amber, our day-of coordinator, was an absolute dream to work with. She went above and beyond to help us whenever needed. She really understood us and how to make our vision possible. Danielle and Gina were amazing and so attentive during the reception. They and the rest of the staff made sure the night was everything we hoped for. We could not recommend The Roundhouse enough as a wedding venue.

Pictures really don't do Flushing Town Hall justice - every part of the venue is beautiful. We took pictures in the garden, had our ceremony in the gallery, and had our reception in the theatre. Each space was totally different but still gorgeous. All of the different artwork throughout the building gave it such a unique look - it's the perfect venue for anyone looking for a beautiful space that doesn't feel like a typical wedding venue. On top of that, we were able to choose every single one of our vendors, which was so difficult to find anywhere else.

If you have visited the Foundry, you know how amazing and beautiful it is, but what you don’t know before you work with them is how responsive and helpful they are once you have committed to them. We had about 130 guests and used the main room for the ceremony, the greenhouse room and space outside for the cocktail hour, the courtyard for the reception dinner, the main room again for the dancing, and the greenhouse room again for the after party (11 to midnight). We also rented the Du Val suite for getting ready, and it was a superb space for the groom’s party and extended family to get ready and hang out and also has the most beautiful garden with city views. Our wedding was absolutely amazing and vindicated our immediate love for the Foundry that we developed the first time we toured it, and the Foundry staff are extremely helpful and kind.

We loved the Picnic House for our May wedding. It was everything we wanted -- like we walked to the park and all our friends and family were there to celebrate with us. The area behind the venue where we did the wedding was in total bloom which was very special, but Prospect Park is ALWAYS going to be special! The new floor really elevates the indoor space, and it all felt lovely, personal and unpretentious. Great acoustics too -- never felt overwhelmingly loud but the dance party went OFF.

My husband and I hosted an anniversary party at the Housing Works Bookstore, and the team truly made our vision come to life! Each team member we interacted with was a pleasure to work with, both during the planning process and on the night-of. Many of our guests commented on how unique and special the venue was, and we completely agreed. We'd highly recommend hosting a celebration at the Housing Works Bookstore!
