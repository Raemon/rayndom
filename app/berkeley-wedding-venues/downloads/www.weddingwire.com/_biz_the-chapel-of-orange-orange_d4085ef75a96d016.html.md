Oct 2025 Wedding Ceremony

We chose Chapel of Orange for our ceremony-only package and had an amazing experience. The staff is incredibly organized, warm, and supportive, which made the planning process so easy as a bride. We met with Cheryl, who was clear, friendly, and communicative from the start, and we truly appreciated her guidance. Our officiant, Drue, proactively reached out to schedule a call and thoughtfully included the personal details we asked for during the ceremony. A special thank you to Melissa, our coordinator, who helped with decorations, communication, and ensured everything ran smoothly on the wedding day. The team also arranged a ceremony walkthrough the day before with our friends and family, which helped everyone feel prepared. We also appreciated having both a bridal suite and groom suite, which made getting ready and taking photos very convenient. The venue itself is beautiful, and we would highly recommend Chapel of Orange.

Amazing! It's the best!

It's been a little over a week since my daughter got married at the Chapel of Orange. Our experience with Chapel of Orange was AMAZING! It truly is a one-stop shop. The caterer Cheryl, the owner, uses is top-notch. The food was SO good and they were also very accommodating with our guests' dietary needs, such as dairy free, gluten free, vegan, and they were even able to coordinate and have a Kosher meal for one of our guests who required a Kosher meal! The cake my daughter ordered from the Los Alamitos bakery, one of the bakeries Cheryl uses, was beautiful and delicious! The florist, Dizzy Daisy Weddings, did a beautiful job with all the flower arrangements. The pianist, My Tran, was a wonderful piano player, and the DJ was also great and played music in the style that my daughter and her fiancé had requested. Melissa, the wedding coordinator, was just amazing all throughout the whole wedding, and we didn't have to worry about anything! She was one step ahead the whole day and had even gathered and put all the things we had brought to be used for the wedding in one place for us to easily gather to take home! The whole place is just so beautiful...from the chapel, to the garden patio, to the reception room with a beautiful copper ceiling. The Chapel of Orange is truly the BEST!

A fantastic wedding!

Cheryl and Melissa were fantastic and made our wedding so special! The venue is beautiful and just what we wanted for both ceremony and reception. We had about 60 people attend, and this venue was the perfect size! Overall, the inclusiveness of the wedding packages made planning smooth while still allowing for flexibility and adding our unique touches. Vendors included in the package were high quality and responsive to our requests. As mentioned, Cheryl and Melissa were communicative and supportive through this whole process. We definitely recommend the Chapel of Orange!

Hidden Gem

I was recently at a wedding at the Chapel of Orange and truly enjoyed every aspect of it. The chapel was quaint, and the ceremony lovely. The gardens, where we had cocktail hour and enjoyed drinks and appetizers while waiting for the couple to return from getting photos, were lovely. I have to say I've never seen a more enchanted ballroom. It was simply breathtaking the moment you walked in. In a word, "Stunning". The food was the best I've ever had at a wedding, and with a big family, I've been to a number of weddings. I hope to come to another one at the Chapel of Orange. Keep up the good work!

Whenever someone I know has a wedding, I always recommend this place.

The right atmosphere for our ceremony. The warmth of the staff. When we discussed our English difficulties, they helped us find staff who could speak Japanese. We are very grateful.

Beautiful Place for a Special Event 

We recently attended a wedding at the Chapel of Orange. It was one of the nicest events I've been to in a long time. Very convenient to have the ceremony and reception together. As a guest but also in the wedding party I'm not sure of the pricing aspect but I do know the food was excellent! Each table had a "theme" and was uniquely decorated right down to the china. Absolutely stunning!   
Cheryl and Melissa know their stuff... very helpful and professional... did everything to make everyone's night so memorable!!

Amazing Wedding Ceremony & Reception

I was recently a guest at the most beautiful wedding located at the Chapel of Orange. It is truly a hidden gem as one cannot see it from the street. Upon entering the historic chapel, I realized what a special backdrop the imposing Gothic chapel made for the couple's ceremony. The English style gardens were also quite romantic for the appetizer hour with music floating through the air and the overhead shades lit by romantic vintage bulbs. However, nothing came close to the "wow" entrance into the ballroom that was stunning beyond words with it's old world like flooring, décor, fireplace and even bronze ceiling tiles and bronze/crystal chandeliers.   
The food was exceptional and I'm told is by an award winning caterer voted as one of the top two best caterers in Orange County. The DJ had everyone on their feet and dancing to a combination of oldies but goodies and popular hits. The unlimited bar was a welcome surprise and the decadent cake served for dessert just melted in my mouth. So much fun was had by all that I know I'm not alone in regretting we had to leave at the end of the night. I sincerely hope to get invited to another wedding at this amazing venue!

Beautiful Venue

Had the honor of having our wedding here a few months ago! An absolutely beautiful venue that I would highly recommend to anyone that was planning their wedding. The venue was gorgeous and they were very accommodating. It was a blessing to get married at the same venue that my parents got married at more than 20 years ago. We had about 150 people for our wedding ceremony and everyone fit comfortably. Check it out if you have a chance!

AMAZING! Cheryl and Melissa are incredible! 

We had our wedding ceremony at The Chapel and we couldn’t have asked for a better location! We worked with Cheryl and she was so helpful and knowledgeable of everything wedding! Our rehearsal was with Cheryl and Melissa and they were so helpful! We had this vision for our wedding entrance song and I wanted to walk in at a certain point and they made sure we got our vision! We will be incredibly grateful to them for making our wedding ceremony vision come to life!

Absolutely Phenomenal!

When my now husband and I began our wedding planning, we immediately knew that we had to do something different. We were faced with the challenge of finding a venue and vendors who could think outside of the typical wedding box in order to help execute our vision. The minute we walked into the Chapel of Orange and met Cheryl and Melissa, we knew we found our wedding "home".   
  
Not only were we provided with top notch vendors, but ones who appreciated the creativity we challenged them with. Melissa and Cheryl guided us through every step of the way and offered their expertise tailored towards our vision.   
  
Every time I had a question, Cheryl was quick in responding in the most kind and professional way. When the day came, I was astounded to experience the friendliest folks helping to ensure that everything and everyone was where it/they should be and the entire event coasted along seamlessly.   
  
From the custom wedding design and meal tasting, through the ceremony and reception, all the way to our sendoff, we enjoyed the entire process, stress-free. Our guests raved about the venue and staff -- one guest who needed ice to help an injury that occurred several weeks before our wedding was supplied with ice and was able to stay for the entire event. That extra care speaks volumes to the amazing staff at the Chapel of Orange!   
  
We will never forget our wedding day and how beautifully everything came together. Huge thanks to Cheryl, Melissa, and all of the top notch vendors working behind the scenes!
