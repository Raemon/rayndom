Cartmill Creations did an amazing job on the flowers for my wedding day! She helped me work through ideas and options and was a huge part of making my wedding day dreams come true! I had some different things I wanted to incorporate in my bouquets and she went above and beyond to start collecting items well in advance. Her work was absolutely stunning and she was very professional to work with. Flowers were delivered on time with care instructions to make sure they stayed beautiful all day in the heat!

when i got married i looked for florists, and found that some wichita area ones that are known for their wedding flowers were snobby and acted like you were waisting their time. I called Marie a friend of my family and longtime neighbor of my mom to do my flowers she did them last min, and made them so beautiful and on a budget. they were exactly what i wanted.
