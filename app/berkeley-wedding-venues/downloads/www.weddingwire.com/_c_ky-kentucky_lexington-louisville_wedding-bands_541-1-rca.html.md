We were worried about my daughter’s wedding reception being so late. It was definitely not a problem. Kat and the band kept the guests engaged and entertained all night long. The dance floor was packed. Such a fun night!!

There is no doubt that Kudmani is the BEST band that you can have on your wedding day! They were professional, entertaining, engaging, and on track time wise for the whole evening. We got several comments that we had the best wedding band our guests had ever seen! If you have a request, Sammy and his team will make it happen. I would recommend them time and time again!

The Artie Dean Harris Band was the absolute perfect band for my wedding! Artie was very timely and professional in communicating with me, and was very easy to work with. As soon as I heard the band in person I knew instantly they were the band for us, their musical talent is undeniable and our guests danced the night away! They were a huge part of making the atmosphere so much fun at our reception. We love the Artie Dean harris Band and would happily recommend them to any friend or bride hunting for a band!
