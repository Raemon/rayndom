Highest Quality Asian Delight!

Wasabi absolutely delivers; with the most delicious and high-quality food wedding guests have ever seen! If you want your menu to be a luxurious and elegant affair that guests remember, do yourself a favor and go with Wasabi.   
  
Daniel and the whole Wasabi team are extremely professional, courteous, and attentive to details.

Fresh Sushi & Great Service!

We recently tried Wasabi Ankeny for dinner, and the experience was top-notch. The sushi was fresh and flavorful — especially the Angry Dragon roll and the crab-and-cream-cheese roll, which were both delicious. The restaurant has a modern, relaxed vibe with plenty of seating (great for groups or a casual night out). Our server was friendly, attentive, and helped pick dishes when we asked — we left full and happy. Definitely plan to come back for sushi (and maybe ramen) the next time we’re in the area.

Top of the line service 

The absolute best customer service that you will ever experience. They went above and beyond. I am highly impressed and would definitely recommend their services to anyone. If you’re looking for someone who will satisfy your needs. And be professional, and pay attention to details, these are your people 10 out of 10.
