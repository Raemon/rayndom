Julia performed for our wedding and we wanted music that better matched our personalities. Instead of Canon in D (the famous wedding song), she performed music from Howl’s Moving Castle for the bride. She also performed music from Final Fantasy and Mario for us, and we couldn’t have asked for a better musician for our wedding day. We highly recommend Julia!

We went back and forth on if hiring a string quartet for our ceremony would be worth it or not... but it was the perfect elegant touch to our intimate wedding ceremony. The musicians were so talented and professional, and they have a wonderful catalog of music to choose from, or you can choose to customize your package with songs of your choice, too! Tori was so kind and responsive and made sure that all the details and plans for the ceremony were clear. I would highly recommend!

We recently had the pleasure of having Elope Music perform at our wedding, and they were absolutely incredible! The string quartet played for our pre-ceremony, ceremony, and cocktail hour, and it truly added such an elegant and magical touch to our day. We went back and forth on whether to have live music, and I can confidently say that choosing Elope Music was one of the best decisions we made. From the moment they started playing, we knew we made the right choice! Their talent and professionalism were evident, and we received endless compliments from our guests!! If you’re considering live music for your event, I highly recommend Elope Music!

I highly recommend John. From the very beginning, he truly listened to our requests and understood how important it was to reach guests across different generations at our wedding. He brought our vision to life perfectly. Our music felt like an expression of our relationship. John was professional, kind, and an absolute joy to work with. We feel so lucky to have found him.

Highly recommend hiring Nexus Strings for your special event. I hired them for my wedding in September 2023 and they made the day so magical and special. They played during the ceremony and cocktail hour, and have an extensive repertoire of both classical and contemporary music to pick from. As a musician myself, I can attest to the quality of their performance and cannot say enough how great they were. Kayla was very communicative and easy to work with through the booking and planning process, and overall I thought the value was well worth it.

A Touch of Class made our garden wedding magical! We got married in September at the Denver Botanic Gardens with a harp trio playing through our prelude, ceremony, cocktail hour, and dinner. Everything was pitch-perfect, and the trio was a hit with our guests. Working with Tracy was a breeze, and when we couldn’t find the sheet music for a song we wanted to use for our procession, she was able to get it transcribed at a very reasonable price! We would hire A Touch of Class again in a heartbeat.
