Marilyn is the best! 

Our wedding ceremony was small, with only immediate family. Before meeting Marilyn, I feared our ceremony would be too short or not personal enough for the people who know us best. But Marilyn made it perfect... so personal, just the right length, serious and funny. We loved it, as did all of our family. They thought we had known Marilyn prior to hiring her because she knew so much about us and our relationship. I would recommend Marilyn to anyone looking for an officiant!

I would recommend Marilyn to any couple!

Marilyn was so easy to work with! We loved getting to know her and sharing our love story. She took a lot of our worries and anxieties of the big day away by being organized and by providing us with a detailed plan. We truly couldn't have picked a better officiant!

Exactly what I had hoped for 

For me, the ceremony was the most important part of our wedding day. I wanted a ceremony that was personalized and spoke to us as a couple. Marilyn provided exactly that!! She wrote a beautiful ceremony that told our love story and exceeded my exceptions on what our ceremony could be. Marilyn was very easy to work with and will guide you through planning your ceremony. I 100% recommend her!

Best decision of the entire event!

Marilyn was professional, understanding, flexible with edits, extremely friendly and also calming. Our brief ceremony was personalized, meaningful and memorable to all of us. Marilyn was like a member of our family, and I wish she could have stayed for the reception! We highly recommend her as an officiant, and are SO glad she was available!

Beautiful ceremony

Working with Marilyn was one of the best decisions we made when planning our wedding! I had so many guests tell me how much they enjoyed our ceremony and that it felt like she had known us as a couple for years. My husband and I aren't super outgoing but she knew the right questions to ask to get us to open up. Thank you Marilyn for helping make our day so perfect.

Marilyn was a wonderful officiant for my marriage

Marilyn was a wonderful officiant for my marriage. Communication was straightforward and she gave me the price for her services upfront and without any hassle. She was very nice and I'm happy she was our officiant. (I was not compensated for my review.)

Marilyn is the BEST!

Marilyn is the best. From the first time we met I could tell that we were going to have her officiate our wedding. She is very personable and easy to get along with. We met for our first consultation and she gave us a bit of homework to do. The questionnaire she sent us to fill out really helped us relay our thoughts and feelings. The ceremony she created for us was so well written and defined us to a "T". She was very well spoken and everyone at our wedding couldn't stop talking about how beautiful the ceremony was. I would 10/10 recommend Marilyn.

Roaring 20’s Wedding 

Our original officiant canceled on us at the last minute. With the help of WeddingWire we were able to find and thankfully book Marylin. She was absolutely great! Very flexible and responsive to our needs, provided great recommendations to make our ceremony unique and special.

Wonderful Experience

After doing research and contacting multiple officiants, Marilyn was our pick. She was very responsive and professional from the very beginning. She custom made our non-secular vows and worked with us throughout the process. She made the process stress free and very easy! I would definitely recommend her to everyone I know.
