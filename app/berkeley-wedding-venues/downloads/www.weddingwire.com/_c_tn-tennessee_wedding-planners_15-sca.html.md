Emylea was an absolute lifesaver on my best friend’s wedding day. I was the maid of honor and felt much more relaxed knowing Emylea was going to be with us. I saw firsthand how much work goes on behind the scenes and she handled everything perfectly. She was kind, calm, and always one step ahead. She helped make all of the Brides visions come true ! The day was beautiful. We’re all still talking about how we are so grateful for Emylea !

We had our Chattanooga wedding in September of 2025 and boy are Maura and her team spectacular! Her prices are beyond affordable compared to the work that she puts in during the planning process and day of. Maura was incredibly flexible to last minute schedule and decor changes, helped us through last minute DJ dropouts, and even recommended our photography company (who also did awesomely). She facilitated our wedding decor and I cannot stress enough how good everything looked. Literally better than we imagined. There was an unexpected punk(?) rock (?) open mic concert across the street from our venue and I thought, "well there goes a serene ceremony." Maura (unprompted) asked them to pause their event so that we could have our ceremony - which they did (crisis averted!). She made sure we ate enough, had special personal moments throughout the day, and organized our sendoff and cleanup. We still get calls from Friends and Family about how awesome Maura and her team were. We really can't express how much we recommend her to anyone planning a wedding (really anyone planning anything)! Thanks for being awesome Maura!

Patrice and her team are absolutely phenomenal. Patrice is the perfect advocate and guide if you need any sort of assistance during your wedding planning process. Her team members, Gina and Cheyenne were there with us day of our wedding and they were the perfect team to ensure our day flowed smoothly and was perfect, despite our venue having major issues and almost needing to move our wedding at the last minute. Seriously, if you want your day to be stress free and amazing, HIRE PLS!!

Absolutely loved our florals and decor that Charming Bridal did. Naomi really understood our vision and we let her be creative from there and she did not disappoint. Not only was she budget conscious and honest, she was just all around fun to work with! I recommend her for budget friendly brides looking for gorgeous creative florals.

All I knew is I wanted bright joyful colors in my florals, and Amy really helped pull together a vision and make it reality! I was blown away by what her team did! My mom raved afterwards about how calm but attentive Amy was during our wedding day. She made any potential issues disappear. My husband even said to me "can we be friends with her after this?" because she's such a great person to work with! I would highly recommend Amy and her team, they made our day perfect and did it with a smile!!

Hiring Kristy and Margaret Claire’s as our full-service wedding planner was one of the best decisions we made!! From our first conversation, we were impressed by her talent and expertise. Kristy was organized, professional, and incredibly knowledgeable. She and her team guided us through every step of the process with ease. What was overwhelming became genuinely enjoyable because we knew we were in expert hands. Kristy took the time to understand our daughter’s vision and brought it to life in ways that exceeded our expectations. Every detail from vendor coordination and timelines to design, logistics, and last-minute adjustments was managed flawlessly. On the wedding day, Kristy and her team made sure everything ran seamlessly, allowing us to truly relax and be present in the moment. We didn’t have to worry about anything. She and her team were amazing resources for any questions we had. Not only are Kristy and her team exceptionally talented, but they are also kind, responsive, and fun to work with! Our wedding was beautiful and stress-free, and we are forever grateful! Friends and family haven’t stopped complimenting everything about the wedding! All I can say is hire Kristy and Margaret Claire’s … you will not be disappointed!!

Rachel was incredibly easy to work with. She listened to and executed our wish list and helped us think through details we hadn’t thought about at all. I definitely felt comfortable to relax and enjoy our wedding day knowing she was taking care of all the logistics. Her many years of experience gave us much needed advice as we navigated the puzzle of wedding planning. Couldn’t recommend more!
