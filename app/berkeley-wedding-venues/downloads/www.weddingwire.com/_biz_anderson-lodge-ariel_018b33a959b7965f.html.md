Beautiful Rustic Venue

This venue is AMAZING! We got married in August 2021 at the Main Lodge. We were able to stay two nights, which allowed us more time with friends and family and the flexibility to decorate and rehearse! There are so many options within the site to use (ceremony circle, patios, inside dining area, pavilion, and conference room) and also came with a lot of amenities included (chairs, plates/cutlery, built in bar, sauna, etc.) There are many options for camping/RV, and inside lodging that most of our guests were able to stay all weekend with us! The Main Lodge is so beautiful, that you don't need many decorations! Arvid, Vikki and Richard were AMAZING to work with! Booking Anderson Lodge was the best decision we made!

Amazing venue

This venue was amazing!! All of our guests were blown away by the beauty of the venue and the different areas to enjoy, from the ceremony site views, wooded areas for photographs, orchard and field for camping, hiking trails, and indoor spaces - and campfire amphitheater for late night drum circles! Everyone was amazing to work with, and the preferred caterer was equally amazing. Definitely recommend.

Stunning and accommodating!

All of our guests absolutely raved about how gorgeous everything was! The staff were nothing but amazing.   
There isn’t cell service for quite a ways out unless you have AT&T, and WiFi very weak so it’s hard to work around that on your wedding day but otherwise can’t rave enough! Recommend 10/10!

Amazing and magical time! 

This was the best venue and using them made our wedding magical. I continue to replay our wedding day and every time I think about how perfect this venue was! I would absolutely use this place again if I had to do this all over.

Anderson Lodge was the perfect venue for us. Coming here was like going to our wedding getaway instead of a quick wedding time slot like so many places. We had 2 nights there, with many people staying at the venue with us or nearby. With so many people coming from out of town, it was incredible to have this time with everyone. Not to mention, it was beautiful. Everyone managing the venue was very easy to work with & answered my many questions without complaint. I highly highly recommend them!!

We had our 3 day, 2 night wedding in early September 2015 at the Hilltop House at Anderson Lodge. The site is stunningly beautiful with gorgeous views and seclusion in the woods. So many of our guests commented on what a beautiful setting we had chosen for our wedding. The Anderson's are also wonderful people who are a pleasure to work with- it felt like we were working with family. I would highly recommend Anderson Lodge for a wedding site!

We got married at the Anderson Lodge in July and absolutely loved it! The Andersons are so wonderful to work with, they are understanding and truly want you to have the wedding of your dreams. It is a flexible venue with lodging included! They helped me anytime I had questions or needed recommendations. We got so many compliments on how beautiful our venue was. And it doesn't require much decoration because the nature surrounding is so beautiful already. Highly recommend!

I absolutely loved the Main Lodge venue that we booked for our wedding day. Guests were able to come up on Friday and stay through Sunday morning, giving us more time to see people who had traveled from out of town. The location is a beautiful outdoor setting, and there is lots of space for people to sleep either in cabins or camp out. The outdoor patio area made for an idyllic ceremony space, and later on for a dance party! I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a rustic, romantic wedding. The owners were fantastic to work with as well!

Anderson Lodge is absolutely one of the most stunning locations that I've ever seen. They are so easy to work with, have two gorgeous venues to fit different styles...and you can even get the venue for the entire weekend! The best decision that I made, aside from marrying my husband, was booking my wedding weekend with Anderson Lodge.
