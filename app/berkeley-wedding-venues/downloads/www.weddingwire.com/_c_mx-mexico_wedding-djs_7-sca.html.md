Emiliano was with us from the very beginning, planning everything we needed, finding the best options that fit our budget, and always making sure every detail was thought out so our big day felt like a dream. Simply the best. They have an excellent understanding of how lighting and sound distribution should be handled. Emiliano always worked hand-in-hand with us, supporting us in every way possible. Everything was adapted to our tastes, and they made sure to leave us with the best experience, always keeping our guests entertained and engaged. There’s no way to fully express our gratitude for all their support — I would recommend them without hesitation.

We were assigned DJ Barby for our destination wedding at Unico 2087 in summer 2024, and she absolutely delivered on service and professionalism. I met with her and the coordinators from Mills James about 2 weeks before our wedding to go over details and the types of music we wanted for our reception. She came over during our reception dinner to introduce herself, congratulate us, and even complimented our music choices. We trusted her to read the vibe, and she kept us and all our guests on the dance floor all night! Mills James also provided lighting for our outdoor reception, and we loved the ambiance they created!

Mark was the perfect DJ for our Wedding Day! We provided specific playlists for cocktail hour, reception, and the dancing portion of the evening as a reference point and Mark played all the songs we wanted! He understood the vibe we were looking for and all of our guests were raving about the music. The LED dj stand and the CO2 gun were also a HUGE highlight. We had an incredible time and would recommend to anyone.

The DJ did a great job of keeping the party moving and the dance floor full; paying attention to when people weren't dancing much to the song and switching it.

Dj Extassis was absolutely amazing and made our wedding unforgettable. They were extremely professional and truly listened to what we wanted. We shared our music preferences and special moments, and everything was executed perfectly. The music flowed all night, the remixes were fantastic, and we never stopped dancing. Our guests had an incredible time and left so happy. Highly professional, talented, and attentive — 100% recommended!

I was uncertain hiring a DJ outside of the recommended vendors at our hotel, but it was the best choice we made!!! The cost was HALF of the recommended vendor. We went with the basic DJ package and 2 strings of lights. I sent my song list and the dance floor was packed the entire time!! The DJ did a great job with announcements, timing, and reading the crowd to give the best experience. The fact we are primarily English speaking was not a problem at all!! Thank you so much for making our reception the best party ever :D

We used Digital Sound for our reception in February of 2023, at Royalton Riviera Cancun. They exceeded my every expectation. The price, professionalism, and communication was beyond amazing. I cant say enough good things. Our DJ was Manuel, and he kept the party going all night. I provided little guidance as to what type of music. He did amazing! Prices were very reasonable as well.

We truly could not have asked for a better DJ for our wedding. From the moment they arrived, everything felt effortless. They were on time, set up incredibly quickly, and required very little direction—which is huge on a day where there are already a thousand moving pieces. We had a small but very lively group and requested a karaoke setup along with a simple, flexible reception schedule. They absolutely nailed it. The transitions between epic dance music and guest-requested karaoke songs were seamless, keeping the energy high and the night flowing naturally without ever feeling forced. They completely understood the vibe we were hoping for and helped create a fun-filled, joy-packed evening that felt authentic to us and our guests. The dance floor stayed alive, the laughter never stopped, and the night unfolded perfectly. I truly could not praise them enough if I tried. If you’re looking for a DJ who is professional, adaptable, intuitive, and genuinely invested in making your event unforgettable—look no further.
