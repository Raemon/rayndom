We used the Draper location as our reception venue and hosted a private dinner in there. It was stunningly beautiful. We paid for no additional lighting--- the way it is lit and arranged is amazing. The venue easily accommodated the 110 or so guests we had. I was so pleased with the accommodation we had. Doug was a rockstar!

Where do I begin? Everything was literally perfect. \- The staff was accommodating, kind, insanely helpful, and they worked hard and fast to make sure everything got done in time. They were also very fun to chat with, and were always a good vibe. \- The facility was very clean and kept in great condition. There were also lots of fun things to find in the hotel, such as an arcade room and game room on the 7th floor. \- Having the entire hotel for your party for the weekend was definitely the move. We had the pool to ourselves and all of the facility amenities. \- The views were nuts. I mean, obviously, we were in Little Cottonwood Canyon, but having high rustler in the background is next level \- The spa was very nice, the pool and hot tubs were perfect, the food tasted great, there was shuttle service to Oktoberfest at Snowbird, the lawns and yards were manicured well, I could go on and on. Bottom line: Book it. It’s worth it.

We couldn't have chosen a more perfect place for our wedding than Louland Falls. The venue is truly breathtaking — nestled right into the mountainside, surrounded by natural red rock formations and lush greenery. There's even a peaceful creek that winds through the property and leads back into a serene canyon. It feels completely tucked away and private, even though it's just off Parleys Canyon. You’d never guess such a hidden oasis exists so close to the city. The owner and coordinators were incredibly responsive and helpful throughout the entire planning process. Every message and email was answered promptly, which really helped ease any stress. The catering was delicious — every dish was fresh and flavorful, and we loved that they host open house events where you can taste the food and meet with vendors beforehand. It made planning much more personal and enjoyable. Louland Falls gave us a magical, natural setting and professional support to make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend to any couple looking for a scenic, mountainous, and well-run venue!

This venue… I don’t even know how to describe its beauty, its unique landscape, and the amazing folks who work there. Our wedding in October could not have been more perfect. We wanted to get married somewhere that was quintessential Utah, while also finding somewhere super unique that our friends and family could experience. I have had so many folks say how incredible the venue was in the weeks following our wedding. Its proximity to downtown Moab, as well as the National Parks (Arches/Canyonlands/Dead Horse) - you seriously cannot go wrong with Red Earth Venue!

My husband and I had so much fun staying up here in one of the cabins! It is so cozy and such a gorgeous view. We had some of our wedding pictures taken up here and it was so perfect. The setting, the cute cabins, the bathrooms, the scenic view of the pinnacles. Such a fun place to stay and I always appreciate a well kept bathroom area especially that has showers. Would recommend for bigger groups and family’s. Looks like a great space for kids to run around and play.
