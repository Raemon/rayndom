A dream! Smooth, easy, professional

This review is long overdue as I got married back in September 2019, but Elliston deserves to be recognized! Everything about Elliston Vineyards is magical. We chose the venue because of the location, intimate and regal ambiance and the fact that couples almost get their own "wedding planner" when you book the venue!  
Elliston's staff definitely knows what they're doing and it's obvious everyone who works in the wedding department loves their job. We got assigned to Kimberly about 2 months prior to the wedding, but they do have staff to answer any questions prior to getting assigned a coordinator.   
Kimberly was literally an ANGEL. I will never forget when I walked in for a meeting and she asked how everything was going and I said I was stressed. She looked at me with a calm and warm voice and said "why?". Her demeanor and confidence in all the details instantly made me feel at ease and I trusted that I had a good team on my hands. We appreciated her honesty when we were selecting our meal/appetizer items and she was so knowledgeable about every detail! I didn't hire a wedding planner, and trust me when I say you don't need one! Planning a wedding is bound to have stressful moments, but when I look back on this experience, it wasn't as stressful as I had imagined it to be. I'm confident that it is because Kimberly and Elliston staff took care of a lot of things that brides would normally have to figure out on their own. Would I do it all over again? In a heartbeat!   
Thank you to Kimberly :) and the rest of Elliston's team that made our wedding day easily one of the best days of our life! I miss it so much already!

First class . Our wedding planner, Kathleen, was the absolute best. She was an immense help in putting together our beautiful wedding. ! 

Beautiful venue hidden in Sunol, our wedding was an absolute fairytale. Kathleen and her Team were amazing. From the planning stage to the actual day of our wedding they were there for us. The venue is gorgeous;, the service impeccable; the food delicious. All of family and guests raved about what a beautiful spot this is.

Excellent venue choice!

We had a great experience with Elliston Vineyards. The combination of a beautiful location near Pleasanton, with a day of coordinator (awesome!), great food, and a beautiful ceremony site. I loved that we could make it ours and still have the ease of so much being provided for us on site.

Our Wedding Was a Success!

We chose Elliston because of their excellent location (away from the City, but still reachable from all over the Bay Area), beautiful grounds, very reasonable pricing, especially when considering the level of service and area provided. The location was tucked away in Sunol, but was very accessible via multiple freeways. The property grounds are gorgeous, and we received many compliments on our venue choice! We love the vineyards, koi pond, and especially the mansion. We would definitely host another event at Elliston, and recommend the venue to our friends & coworkers.   
  
Our Day-of Coordinator was Tiffani, and she was wonderful to work with! She was knowledgeable about the venue, and provided many great tips to plan ahead so our day went as smoothly as possible. She was also very responsive to all our questions and many emails! We sent her pics of how we wanted our table decor set up, and all the Elliston staff paid special attention to all the specific details we wanted.   
  
Also wanted to give a special thank you to Donna for opening up the mansion to us a bit early so we could take pictures indoors instead of out in the rain! The rainy weather was a big surprise, but Elliston was a big help in adjusting and keeping our day special and magical.   
  
Finally, the food. Yummy scalloped potatoes! Many of our guests came back for more servings! Also, the salmon was fresh and cooked to perfection. Many of our guests raved about the salmon. Overall, the food tasted much better when compared to when we went to the food tasting. High value for price.

Highly recommend Elliston!

We got married at Elliston Vineyards on October 7, 2018 (Sunday) after about a year of planning our wedding with the Elliston staff – and wow, every detail was exactly as we had hoped for! The wedding coordinators went above and beyond to ensure that our ceremony and reception were truly memorable for our family and friends (about 90 guests). First, we would like to thank Donna and Madeline for helping us book the venue and coordinate the details during our 6-month and 2-month planning meetings, especially since we are both in the military and were stationed overseas during the entire year that we planned our wedding. Two months out from our wedding date, we were assigned our day-of-coordinator, Kirsten, who was so wonderful to work with and helped us with every last detail – she is extremely detailed, knowledgeable, and responsive, and she facilitated conversations behind the scenes with our other vendors that made everything feel seamless on the day of our wedding. Thank you, Kirsten, for making our special day stress-free for us and our family and friends, and doing it all with a huge smile!  
  
Pre-wedding planning: we found several tools provided by Elliston to be really helpful. The Social Tables seating chart website helped us visualize where we wanted our guests to be seated during our reception and made it really easy to input meal preferences, and to make last-minute changes as needed. Elliston also offers several menu tastings throughout the year, and though we were not able to attend in person because we lived out-of-state, we had two family members go on our behalf, and they loved sampling the hors d’oeuvres and dinner menu options. Elliston also hosted their annual wedding fair where we were able to speak with several preferred vendors that ended up being the perfect fit for what we were looking for and answered our questions based on lots of experience with weddings at Elliston.   
  
The venue: we feel so lucky to have found Elliston Vineyards for our ceremony and reception; it is absolutely a hidden gem with so many different beautiful locations for taking pictures: the historic mansion (we used the bridal suite and library for getting ready); the gazebo where we had our ceremony; the koi pond; the vineyards with a view of the mountains in the background; and the patio area where we hosted our cocktail hour and reception. It felt just the right size for our wedding of 90 guests. Our ceremony was at 5pm, which was about half an hour before the sun crested the mountains and many of our guests brought sunglasses to wear because they were facing the sun, but we took our individual and family portraits right after the ceremony and the lighting came out perfectly for our pictures. The indoor reception room was spacious enough for our 9 tables plus a sweetheart table and made it really easy for our guests to get up and mingle, go to the bar for drinks, and dance after dinner.  
  
Food and drinks: we ordered 3 hors d’oeuvres for our cocktail hour and 2 mains (salmon, filet mignon) plus a vegetarian option. Our guests raved about the food quality and presentation, and everything came out in a timely fashion. We did have a few guests with some dietary restrictions, and Elliston was able to accommodate their preferences. Kirsten even had an hors d’oeuvres plate prepared for us at our sweetheart table since we were not able to eat during cocktail hour while we were taking our pictures – such a thoughtful thing to do and definitely did not go unnoticed! Our guests also really liked the Elliston wines served at the bar (red, white) and had no issue getting drinks throughout the night. Many asked if they could buy bottles to take home!  
  
All in all, we had a 10/10 experience at Elliston Vineyards and highly recommend it as a wedding venue! We will forever cherish our memories shared with friends and family and the pictures from such a beautiful location. Thank you again to the Elliston staff for making our day absolutely perfect!

Intimate and classy

This place is absolutely gorgeous while still being intimate, and the staff here are wonderful! Kimberley was there for us every step of the way and made it all so fun and stress-free. The food and wine Elliston provides is delicious.

Absolutely perfect every step of the way

Elliston is a gorgeous venue made all the better by its wonderful staff. Kimberley was there for us every step of the way, very responsive and accommodating, and such a pleasure to work with. The food they provide is so delicious! Also, their preferred vendor list never steered us wrong, so we had a great team who knew how to work together. Our guests had a wonderful time and I attribute much of that to the beauty of this venue and the hard work of the staff!

I just got married at Elliston Vineyards and it was amazing!!!! The venue alone is breathtaking. We got so many compliments on how beautiful the space is, from the ceremonly location up to where the reception takes place. Madeline was our coordinator and she was amazing, answered every email (and I went through periods of sending a lot) set everything up for us and even packed everything up for us at the end of the night so we didn't have to. Everyone loved the food and the bar (We did their wine, one of their beers and we brought our own beer in and we did speciality cocktails). Really I couldn't have asked for a better place to get married!

Our wedding guests are still talking about how much they loved Elliston! This was the 7th venue we visited and I just knew it was the one for us. While there is so much competition out there, Elliston Vineyards had that nice balance of professionalism and warmth. Kirsten and Meghan (along with all the Elliston Staff and owner) were extremely responsive and helpful with all our questions through the entire process! They helped make our wedding special and I would highly recommend them. Also to note- the champagne was amazing and the food fantastic. But what got me was the natural beauty and rustic elegance of the venue.

Elliston is not only beautiful all year round, they have an amazing staff who takes care of all their couples and vendors alike. I've only had the pleasure of capturing a few weddings and session at Elliston so far but look forward to many more! The historical mansion is perfect for that classic feel and the event center is that modern twist, making this the perfect venue for almost any look or feel.

Elliston Vineyards is a beautiful venue tucked into Sunol among the rolling hills. The mansion is quaint and beautiful, with a rich history to it. The flowing fountains make wonderful backdrops for photos and video as well. Most importantly though besides the beauty of the venue the staff is wonderfully friendly and everything they do, they seem to do the right way.

Elliston Vineyards is a truly unique and beautiful space! The event specialists are on top of everything and their staff is always smiling! The lighting and space is so gorgeous inside the buildings and within the grounds! I always enjoy meeting my bridal clients here!
