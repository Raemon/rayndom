__Small team (2-10 members)

C&K Ranch is a family-owned and operated wedding venue designed for couples who want a relaxed, meaningful celebration centered on family and connection. Set in a peaceful ranch setting, we host intimate weddings with a guest count of 50–60 and offer overnight accommodations for up to 12, creating a comfortable, unhurried wedding-weekend experience.

Weddings at C&K Ranch are personal by nature. Our daughter has dreamed of working in the wedding industry since she was six years old, and that lifelong passion helps guide how each celebration is cared for and hosted. We focus on flexibility, thoughtful details, and a welcoming environment where couples feel supported from start to finish.

With roots in military life and a love for travel, our family values hospitality, organization, and making people feel at home, wherever they are. Those values are reflected in every wedding we host, from the calm atmosphere to the way each couple’s vision is respected.

Couples choose C&K Ranch for its open skies, natural beauty, and genuine, family-centered approach. Here, weddings feel less like a production and more like a heartfelt gathering of the people who matter most.

C&K Ranch Events is a barn and farm wedding venue located in McKinney, Texas.
