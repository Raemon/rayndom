Luckily, you still have options. Focus on getting them keepsakes that will help them remember this special holiday. Personalized engagement gifts like ornaments, custom illustrations or matching Christmas sweaters are all adorable options. However, you can also lean into the festive holiday and gift them luxurious an engagement gift they might not splurge on themselves (think: luxe candles, festive bakeware or a plush throw blanket).

To help spark inspiration, we put together a gift guide of 21 presents they'll absolutely love (and definitely use). Whether you're shopping for the couple that loves to host or [the couple that loves to stay in](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/best-movies-to-watch-wedding-planning), we have something for everyone.
