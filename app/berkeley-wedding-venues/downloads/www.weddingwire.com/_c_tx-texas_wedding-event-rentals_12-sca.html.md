I would recommend lavish floors to anyone who is looking to get married soon needing a custom dance floor! She was able to get me a few samples of my husband and I’s initials and was receptive to feedback on how we wanted the letters exactly. I have seen where many dance floors will not last the whole night with lots of dancing taking place but that is definitely not the case with this vendor. The dance floor was in tact with the initials the whole night. We loved adding this custom touch to our day and cannot thank Muyassar and her team enough for the amazing work they put in to make our day extra special!

Communication with the entire team was great from the beginning. Being able to visit their showroom and see everything in person helped so much with visualizing how everything would come together. They also walked us through the setup timeline, which we really appreciated since our wedding was on family property. I would definitely recommend this team for any event!

From start to finish, this was the absolute best service! We were referred to O&P by our wonderful wedding coordinator & they did not disappoint! Nichole is the one that we worked with, and she was amazing. I explained my vision to her, and we talked back & forth a few times over the planning process and then the day of the event I was blown away!!! Everything was beyond perfect and exceeded my expectations. Our guests still have not stopped talking about how stunning the shower was. Thank you so much for your outstanding service, attention to detail and your ability to make my vison be even better than I imagined. YOU LADIES ROCK!

We used Cohost for our lighting, end of the evening transportation and DJ. Lighting enhanced the vibe of the evening, the Rolls that they got to leave in was luxury on wheels. We had a slight hiccup with the DJ- our original DJ had a medical emergency the day before the wedding and the replacement DJ, Brandon, did a great job! We were pleasantly surprised with how quickly the change over was taken care of and handled for us. Our guests had no idea and loved the energy of the entire evening.

Out Back Party Rentals took phenomenal care of our wedding and we were ecstatic with the quality of our rentals. I will definitely be renting from them again. We are so very thankful to Robert and Molly for all the hard work they did for us and all the kindness they gave me whenever we wanted to change anything. We will keep supporting a small business in our town and will encourage all our friends to only rent from Out Back

I had a great experience with Rent My Wedding. We planned a black light event for August, then lost our venue. Rent My Wedding was very understanding and helpful in rescheduling for November. The lights were exactly as advertised and easy to use. I will use them again for our next event.

Excellent collection and even better customer service! I'd do it again all over again if given the choice.

They have LOTS of great rental options! Almost all the rentals for our wedding came from Premiere including chargers, napkins, linens, cocktail tables, a bar, a seating area and even the stage! The Premiere team brought everything from their warehouse in Austin to our venue out in Boerne and set it up before the wedding, then after the wedding broke everything down and took it back to the warehouse. We didn’t have to lift a finger! It was such a smooth process, and we were thrilled with the quality and style of all the rentals. We highly recommend them for any wedding or event.
