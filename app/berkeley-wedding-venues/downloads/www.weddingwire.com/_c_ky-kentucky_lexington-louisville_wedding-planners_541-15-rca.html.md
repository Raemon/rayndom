## How much does a wedding planner cost?

A wedding planner can be an [absolute lifesaver](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-reasons-your-wedding-planner-is-a-total-lifesaver) for busy couples, ensuring that the planning process and actual event run smoothly. As a professional who’s been through the process before, they can also offer countless wedding planning recommendations and tips. It’s important to know wedding planning is not a one size fits all service - your wedding vision is unique and a wedding planner will customize their offering to fit your needs. Because of this and the wide range of services these professionals provide, pricing varies widely with most couples in the U.S. spending at least $1,500 on wedding planner services for their big day. Wedding planner costs also differ based on the planner’s level of expertise, among many other factors, as more experienced pros typically come with a higher price tag (and with that comes top-tier service!).

  * __ $ 440 or less Lower range
  * __ $ 2,000  Average cost
  * __ $ 1,250 - $ 2,350  Most couples spend between
  * __ $ 3,120 or more Upper range



Costs displayed are based on spend from thousands of couples who recently reported pricing for this service within their WeddingWire review. Pricing varies based on factors including, but not limited to, vendor’s experience, level of expertise, event guest count, date, and geographic region.

What services does a wedding planner's fee include?

__

The services a wedding planner’s cost includes vary depending on the [type of professional you’re hiring](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/the-7-types-of-wedding-planners-and-what-they-do) — whether it’s a full-service, month-of, or day-of planner, or a planner who specializes in [destination weddings](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/destination-weddings--t8). Here are [some of the most common services that your wedding planner may include](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/why-a-wedding-planner-costs-that-much) in his or her package:

  * Correspondence: About 30 percent of a wedding planner’s time is spent communicating with you and your vendors via email and phone. Think of your planner as the “coach” of your vendor team who ensures that all of your wedding pros work together well—and frequent communication is a huge part of that.
  * Venue and vendor selection: Your planner likely has a lot of connections in the wedding industry and can help you pick the right [venue](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-venues) and vendors that can help bring your wedding vision to life. Often, your planner will attend interviews and meetings with you and your vendors, too.
  * Organization: A big part of wedding planning is... paperwork? Yes, unfortunately it’s true. But wedding planners can make sure that all of your budgets, contracts, timelines, etc. are properly organized and easily accessible if needed.
  * Wedding prep: There are lots of seemingly small tasks that go into creating your perfect day both before and on the day-of from creating a [wedding-day timeline](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-timeline), assembling invitations, setting up your favor display, assisting with your [seating chart](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-create-your-wedding-seating-chart), and much more.
  * Day-of coordination: You might not see your wedding planner much on the day of your wedding—and that’s how it should be! Your planner will arrive long before your ceremony begins and stay well afterwards, making sure that everything runs on-time and smoothly from behind-the-scenes and [any issues are handled](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-fiascos-and-how-wedding-planners-solved-them) quickly and quietly so that you and your new spouse can enjoy the day, stress-free!
  * Post-wedding tasks: There will likely be several important tasks to handle after the wedding, from ensuring clean-up and breakdown occur properly to returning rental items and making sure vendors receive their tips.



What wedding events does a planner's fee cover?

__

In most cases, a wedding planner will assist with the wedding itself—both ceremony and reception. However, if you are able to increase your wedding planning budget and costs, your planner can also help plan your rehearsal dinner and post-wedding brunch. If you’re having a destination wedding with lots of events over the course of the weekend, your planner may assist with those as well—but expect to pay more. 

How much does a day-of wedding planner cost?

__

A day-of wedding planner isn’t heavily involved in the wedding planning process and is usually hired closer to the wedding, but has a big role to play on the wedding day, ensuring that the events run on time and everything is running smoothly. On average, the starting cost for a day-of wedding planner in the U.S. is $800 with starting rates for higher-end planners averaging $1,250 to $3,395. 

How much does a partial wedding planner cost?

__

A partial wedding planner usually comes on board a month or so before the wedding day and assists with last-minute tasks—helping with the seating chart, confirming vendors, and day-of responsibilities. The average starting rate for a partial wedding planner in the U.S. comes in at $1,250, but can range from $2,300 to $6,000 if you’re working with a more experienced pro. 

How much does a full wedding planner cost?

__

A full wedding planner helps to plan your wedding from start to finish and is usually hired early on in the planning process—at least 10 months in advance. The average starting rate for a full service wedding planner in the U.S is about $3,000 with top-tier planners averaging $4,500 to $12,000.

After several interviews with wedding coordinators my daughter decided to hire Kaela and her team. Well we both agree...she made the right decision. They were amazing from first meeting to leaving the venue. They were very helpful with suggestions when she was confused on what she wanted, they were organized, professional, timely and fun. Kaela and Shelby were just wonderful to work with. I don't know of anything that went wrong. They had it all under control. I will be recommending these two to anyone that needs someone to help. Because of the work these ladies put in, I was able to enjoy my day with my daughter and that was priceless. Thank you Kaela and Shelby for all your hard work. You were amazing!!!!

If you are looking for a day of wedding coordinator, I promise you Taylor and her team at Champagne Toast Events ARE YOUR PEOPLE!!!! Starting communication 3 months out from the event ensured she was aware of all the details, vendors, and plans well ahead of time. Taylor always responded promptly to any and all of my silly questions leading up to the day. She was incredible and thorough leading up to the wedding and day of, her and her team were beyond amazing. They truly brought my vision to life perfectly. Everything down to each table setting was beyond my expectation. When I saw everything for the first time I was in awe. Her and her team checked on us constantly throughout the day and evening during the reception. They fluffed my dress before walking down the aisle. We never were without food, dessert, or a drink. They made the flow of the day and night so smooth. Everything went perfectly, truly not one mishap and I owe it all to Taylor and her team. They were truly my rock and calm in the storm of all the wedding nerves I was feeling that day. I could never thank Taylor and her team enough for everything they did for us on our wedding day. It’s something I’ll never forget!! It’s worth every single penny to add Taylor to your wedding team because I promise she makes it happen and executes your vision with perfection!!!

Jennifer was our day of coordinator for our October 2025 wedding and did an outstanding job. We did not have to worry or question anything about the day. She kept us on schedule and was amazing to work with. Everyone involved in the wedding highly enjoyed her that day. She was prompt with arriving and responding to any and all questions. She made the moment so relaxed and fun!

My husband and I will be forever grateful for Brandi and everything she did (which was a lot!) to help make our wedding day so special. Although Brandi’s official role was our officiant, she contributed in so many additional ways that went far beyond what her expected role was. As our officiant, Brandi took the time to truly understand our vision—not just for the ceremony, but for the entire day. She provided a super helpful ceremony timeline and attended our rehearsal, where she jumped in to coordinate and support everyone involved. She crafted a beautiful, meaningful ceremony script that captured us perfectly. While she wasn’t hired to be our coordinator, Brandi stepped into that role the moment she saw we needed help. She went above and beyond assisting with venue setup and worked side-by-side with our day-of coordinator to put out several unexpected “fires” that popped up on our wedding day. And she did all of this without ever being asked. Without Brandi, our wedding day truly would not have been as smooth or as special, and it definitely would've been a lot more stressful. Brandi is thoughtful, hardworking, professional, and deeply dedicated, and we cannot recommend her highly enough.

Crystal did a beautiful job with my daughter’s wedding. Her skill and vision are second to none. She kept vendors organized, informed and focused on the big event. Crystal is friendly, easy to talk to and listens intently, not missing a beat. It definitely shows in her attention to detail. She is professional and flexible which was a must for me. Thanks to her, I was able to keep my attention with my daughter on her wedding day, which made it flawless in my eyes!

I worked with Candice for my September 2025 wedding at the Kentucky Derby museum. She made the process so lovely. And helped me organize more than I thought I needed to. She gave me good questions to think about to help with the flow of the event and she executed all of my wildest dreams for my wedding. She was very accommodating to all my request and I can’t thank her enough for helping with my wedding!

Reagan helped us so much with not just the day of coordination, but the the whole month leading up to the wedding. She helped with building out our schedule and helped us figure out a lot of things at the rehearsal. On the day of the wedding, she was there helping us from set up to tear down. Our stress levels were so high leading up to the wedding but when we handed things off to Reagan on the big day it was such a relief knowing that she was on the same page as us, and she made everything go absolutely perfectly. She even took the flower arrangements that were left over to a nursing home for us the next day. She is a wonderful person and an absolute pro at this and we can't recommend her enough!

Jenah and her assistant were wonderful! I hired her for day-of services. We could never have handled set up, take down, or all the behind-the-scenes things with our her! She brought my vision to life and executed flawlessly! My family always says she is so kind and sweet but also knows how to direct people efficiently and get sh** done! We love Jenah and would highly recommend Seed and Seal.
