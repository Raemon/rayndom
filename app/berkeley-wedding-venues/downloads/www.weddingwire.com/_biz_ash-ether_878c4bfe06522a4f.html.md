__Just me

Ash + Ether is a Lafayette, Colorado–based floral design studio specializing in intentional, art-forward wedding florals. I create sculptural arrangements rooted in season, color, and movement — designed to elevate your space and feel true to your day. Every wedding is fully custom; I don’t replicate inspiration photos, and I design with a focus on cohesive, beautifully placed florals from start to finish.

**Services Offered**

I take on only one wedding per week so each event receives my full attention. From initial concepts through delivery, installation, and teardown, I handle every detail to ensure your florals feel refined, seamless, and thoughtfully executed. If you’re looking for modern, intentional wedding florals with a strong point of view, Ash + Ether would be honored to design for you.

Ashely is the BEST!!

Working with Ashley was an absolute dream! From the moment we started working together, it was clear that she is not only incredibly creative and innovative but also deeply passionate about bringing her clients' visions to life. Ashley’s ability to think outside the box and approach every detail with fresh ideas and a unique perspective made the wedding planning process exciting and stress-free.  
  
Throughout the entire journey, Ashley worked seamlessly with all of our vendors, fostering excellent communication and ensuring that everyone was on the same page. Her collaborative approach meant that every aspect of the day flowed smoothly and beautifully. It was evident that she cared about making our wedding not just visually stunning, but an unforgettable experience for our guests, ensuring they had just as much fun as we did.  
  
Some of the things I appreciated most about working with Ashley was her incredible organizational skills and undeniable creativity. She provided vision boards that were so helpful in capturing the overall theme and vibe we wanted, but it was her talent in executing those ideas flawlessly that truly amazed us. She brought every detail to life with such grace and precision, making it all feel seamless and magical.  
  
Ashley’s flexibility and support were invaluable, especially when we had to make last-minute changes or adjustments. She handled everything with such professionalism, always making us feel at ease and confident that everything would turn out perfectly. No matter what came our way, Ashley was right there to offer solutions and ensure we were always on track.  
  
Thanks to Ashley’s expertise, we were able to maximize our budget in a way that allowed us to have the wedding of our dreams without compromising on the elegance and beauty we envisioned. The result was a celebration that looked like it belonged in a magazine, yet still felt personal and heartfelt. There is absolutely no way I could have had the wedding of my dreams without Ashley and her incredible team. I am beyond grateful for all the time, effort, and love they put into making our day perfect.  
  
If you’re looking for a wedding planner who will go above and beyond to make your day truly extraordinary, choosing Ashley will undoubtedly be one of the best decisions you make. Her passion, dedication, and unmatched creativity will ensure that your wedding day is everything you've dreamed of—and more.

Fall Mountain Wedding 

Ashley’s vision was an absolute dream come true for my daughter’s October wedding. The hues were moody and magical bringing an elevated atmosphere to a beautiful venue. She listened to my daughter’s ideas and brought so much more to the table with her creative vision. The “day of” implementation far exceeded my expectations. The professionalism of her team was unprecedented. The bride and groom were delighted with all the beautiful details that were so seamlessly woven into the design. We received so many compliments all day and into the evening. The dining room tables were exquisite along with the ballroom, foyer, and outside ceremony space creating the atmosphere my daughter had dreamt about. The value was amazing for the quality and beauty of the floral design. The florals were fresh, unique, and creatively crafted. I would highly recommend Ash & Ether!
