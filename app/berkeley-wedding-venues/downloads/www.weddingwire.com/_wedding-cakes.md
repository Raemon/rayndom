## What Type of Wedding Cake Is Right For You?

We all know that a celebration simply isn't complete without cake. Of all of the time-honored wedding traditions, eating wedding cake is one of our favorites. Whether this is because of the endless variety of breathtaking decorations, the symbolic gesture of a new couple sharing this treasured sweetness with their loved ones, or because 90 percent of all couples swear they are not going to smear it all over their new spouse (and yet 75 percent of them still do!), or some combination of all these things – wedding cakes are one of the finest, most dazzling, yummiest type of dessert ever!

Now, we know what you're thinking – when can we sample some wedding cake? Keep in mind you should start looking for inspiration around six months before your wedding and plan [cake tasting appointments](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/everything-you-need-to-know-about-a-wedding-cake-tasting "Wedding Cake Tastings: Everything You Need to Know") at least three months before the Big Day. It's important to take into account your wedding theme and color palette when choosing the shape, style and size of your wedding cake.

## Wedding Cake Info You Need to Know

If you're not familiar with the difference between [buttercream and fondant](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/fondant-vs-buttercream "Fondant vs. Buttercream: The Sweetest Wedding Cake Debate"), check out our [Ultimate Wedding Cake Glossary](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/the-ultimate-wedding-cake-glossary "The Ultimate Wedding Cake Glossary"). You can also get inspiration from our [Cakes & Desserts](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/cakes-desserts--t23 "Cake & Desserts") articles. When you've finished some basic research, join the conversation on our [wedding forums](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-forums "Wedding Planning, Wedding Themes") with other engaged couples and newlyweds to get more ideas or hear first-hand what did and did not work on their wedding days.

When you've narrowed your options down to two or three professional wedding cake bakeries, it's time to set tasting appointments. When you schedule, don’t forget to ask whether there is a tasting session fee, so this doesn’t catch you off-guard during your appointment.

## Questions to Ask Your Wedding Baker

When the day of the tasting(s) arrives, here are a few suggestions for what to discuss with your baker to make sure they’re able to create your dream wedding cake. First of all, ask to see photos of past creations. This should give you a good idea of their creative talents. Then, try tasting a variety of different flavors. Often, you can arrange to have each layer be a different type of cake. You can even inquire as to whether they offer vegan, gluten-free or dairy-free flavors. This is important for guests with food restrictions or allergies. You’ll also want to find out if they coordinate with [wedding venues](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-venues "Wedding Venues & Wedding Reception") and [wedding florists](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-florists "Wedding Flowers & Wedding Florists") for cake delivery and set-up – this will save you some trouble if they can connect directly with each other.

If you and your fiancé(e) aren't fans of wedding cake, that's fine, too. You can always opt to go with a smaller cake and/or offer alternative dessert options. Don’t forget to ask your baker about suggestions for other sugary possibilities. If you’re not sure what to do, take a quiz to find [what other wedding desserts you should serve](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/which-dessert-should-you-serve-at-your-wedding "Which Dessert Should You Serve at Your Wedding?") at your wedding.

Before making any final selections, be sure to determine your wedding cake budget. Depending on your preferences, you may choose to splurge on the cake itself and save money on elaborate cake decorations, or vice versa. The helpful WeddingWire [budget planner](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/wedding-budget.html "Wedding Budget Planner") can guide you in making these tough financial decisions. You’ll be able to dig in and enjoy your wedding cake on your Big Day – on-budget and guilt-free!
