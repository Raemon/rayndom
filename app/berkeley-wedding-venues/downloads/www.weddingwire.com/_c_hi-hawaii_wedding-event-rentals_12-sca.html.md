Kea & Loa was an excellent rental partner for our wedding. Their pieces were beautiful and added so much character and style to our event. Everything was delivered on time, set up smoothly, and in great condition, which made the day feel effortless. Their rentals blended perfectly with our overall vision and helped bring the entire design together. The team was professional, responsive, and easy to work with throughout the process. We would highly recommend Kea & Loa to anyone looking for unique, high-quality event rentals.

I worked with Hali at Kauai Tent to book my wedding tent and rentals. She was fabulous - so responsive, quick to get back to me, and answered my many questions. I really appreciated working with Hali and her team from start to finish. I was very impressed by the quality and cleanliness of our HUGE wedding tent, the table rentals, dance floor, outhouses, etc. Our guests were blown away at the size of our tent - it was stunning! It goes without saying these guys do a great job! From planning, to set up and strike, it was great working with Kauai Tent.

Decided to go with Bambooth based on a friends recommendation. I really wanted a photo booth for my guests but I only had a certain $ amount allocated. Most photobooth companies require a minimum of 4 hrs but Bambooth was able to customize a package for me that was in my budget. I think they really went out of their way to get me what I wanted while still staying in my budget. They have a graphic designer that can take any picture/idea and turn it into a logo. They had fun props and at the end of the night, they provided a flash drive with all the pictures of the night. Glad I went with Bambooth. My guests loved it.

We got married at Lanikūhonua. During the early stages of planning, we were told that we’d have to rent everything. That sounded daunting, but we were assured that with Pacific Party rentals we’d be well taken care of. That turned out to be absolutely true. PPR made our wedding aesthetically beautiful and logistical seamless. PPR has an incredibly wide selection of products from which to choose, so we were able to curate the exact vibe and feel for which we were aiming. Their team was very communicative and helpful when we had questions about payment, and they proactively reached out when we needed to make equipment substitutions due to availability. On the day of our wedding, as stated, the venue and design were beautiful, with everything looking exactly as we had envisioned. Our planner let us know that setup and breakdown went smoothly, which she said has always been her experience with PPR. Ultimately, with equipment rentals, you want options, decent pricing (though PPR is not the cheapest), and reliable service. With PPR, we got all three. We highly recommend PPR and would work with them again.

Debra and her team made my wedding day just that much more special. Debra is so accommodating and flexible with all our requests. The prices were reasonable and the food was so delicious. Everyone kept on talking about the poke, the mahi mahi, the amazing coconut cake, the coconut shrimps, the crab cakes .. I can go on and on. The services the team provided was top notch. They were also timely and the presentations were also very pretty. We are so blessed to have found you to be part of our special day.
