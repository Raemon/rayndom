Amazing location for wedding

Incredible location that can sleep up to 60 guests with nearby houses/cabins to rent if you have more people. Directly located on the lake with a massive kitchen and main lodge. Kayak, canoe, and motor boat rentals are available. There are 7 private sandy beaches along the lake with great fishing and hiking trails. Highly recommend!!

Absolutely perfect

If you want an off grid wedding this is the place to be. The lodge is absolutely beautiful and the view is breath taken. If I could redo my wedding day again, I would in a heartbeat

Our Big Day

Dave and Cathie at Nicatous Lodge went above and beyond to make our day special. After meeting him several months before the wedding day, Dave kept regular communication with us to ensure he was creating a customized experience that reflected who we are and what we wanted. Mind you, this was during the height of COVID. He took extra care to ensure we were following all the CDC guidelines, and constantly encouraged us that he was so excited for the big day.  
It was a very small wedding and the Lodge ended up being the perfect backdrop for an outdoor, intimate experience for our family and friends. Our families stayed at the Lodge for three days so they could get to know each other, and now, a month later, everyone is still talking about how magical it was.  
On the wedding day, we had rain, and lots of it. Dave had already come up with a plan B in case the weather prevented us from being outside. He and Cathie turned the Great Room in the Lodge into a quaint, country wedding venue. When Cathie heard my favorite flower was a Black-eyed Susan, she went out in the rain to cut a bunch from her garden and decorate the whole room with them. She even offered to be my errand girl and drive the hour+ into town should I have need of anything. Dave created a campfire for us down by the lake one night, and was kind enough to make his famous Nicatous bean-hole baked beans for the wedding reception (it’s a Maine thing, Google it if you aren’t familiar. It takes eight or more hours!) This is the kind of people they are, bending over backwards to make sure you’re happy. My husband and I can’t say enough good things about them or recommend this venue high enough.   
  
Beware that the Lodge is remote, with little cell signal and lots of dirt roads, but that was the reason we chose it. We love being in the woods. The Lodge also has motor boats and canoes that supplied our families with the opportunity to explore Nicatous Lake. If you love nature and the simplicity and peace that being in nature provides, this place is for you!  
  
It was a perfect wedding weekend and we are so grateful to Dave and Cathie for their tireless efforts to pull it off.
