I had an initial consultation with Julia where she was extremely kind and patient. We went through several options for my suite and she gave me her options. Since signing a contract and paying a deposit, Julia was very communicative and told us when we should have our proofs finalized in order to have our innovations ready in time. Julia sent many versions of proofs for my suite and was patient and flexible when changes needed to be made. When my husband and I picked up our invitations, Julia modeled how to assembly them for us and allowed us to practice before leaving. All of our family and friends loved the invitation and details card, and the liner was their favorite! Julia also made signage for our wedding day. She created a winter wonderland welcome sign, a beautiful seating chart, signature drink signs, memory table and generations of love table signs, menus, and a guest book sign. She exceeded all expectations and our guests loved all of the details on our wedding day. Julia is an amazing person to work with!

Truly the best to work with! JoAnn was so helpful, patient and wonderful throughout the entire process. She was amazing and brought my vision to life. Her creativity and quality of the invites are AMAZING. She made the process so easy without any issues due to her excellent customer service. I can't thank her enough!!

Words are not enough to express the amazingly beautiful job and positive experience we had with The Honour of Your Presence- so attached are some photos. Cherese was able to bring my daughter’s vision to life and with her eye for detail and years of experience she manages to excede our expectations. The custom wedding invitations, seating cards and menus she created were stunning and we are still receiving comments from our guests of them being the most beautiful they’ve ever seen! The level of professionalism coupled with the personal consultation was beyond amazing.

Kelly did an amazing job with our wedding invites! We didn't know what we wanted at all, only some ideas of what we liked and didn't like and Kelly worked with us to create the perfect invites for us. They were simple yet elegant and exactly what we wanted, even better! I would definitely recommend RSVP to me!

We loved our invitations, it was a lot of work ahead of time, but when I arrived at Full House Printing, I had everything ready to go, so it made the job much easier. It was great having someone local to see and touch the invitation papers, not trying to do it online. Having it right in Hoboken was very reassuring. Larry was great to work with!

Overall, Maureen was such a pleasure to work with. She was very flexible in meeting with me and we also did a great deal of communicating via email which was also seamless. My wedding was in Rome, Italy and I wanted the invitations to match the Italian Elegance theme I was going for. We received TONS of compliments on our wedding invitations. They were very elegant and matched everything perfectly. I highly recommend using Memory Makers for your wedding invitations!

We were introduced to Jen/Jar of Ideas through our wedding planner, Jenny Orsini. Jen was fantastic every step of the way. We had a very particular vision for what we wanted for the invitations - a unique color palette and watercolor version of a photo we had. Jen was fantastic in coming up with custom multiple versions of ideas and then iterating with us until everything was even better than we had originally hoped. She helped us stay on budget, and on time (we felt like we started later than we should have on our wedding planning process). She helped match all of the peripheral stationary so that everything carried through our theme. She was also fun and great to work with, plus super responsive. Would look no further for your custom design needs.
