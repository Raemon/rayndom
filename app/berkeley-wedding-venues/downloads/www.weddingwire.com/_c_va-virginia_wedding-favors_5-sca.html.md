Silvia was the best! We had clear and prompt communication beforehand. She was clearly experienced and very professional during our wedding. Our guests loved watching the painting come to life and are still talking about it today. We received our finished painting just 6 weeks after our date, we are so impressed with the quality of the painting! Go with Silvia, you will not regret it!

Beach Engraving engraved our wedding bands for us. It was very easy. We told them what we wanted the rings to be engraved with and what font we wanted (they conviently list all the fonts on their website so you can look at them before hand). It was ready within a week. Highly recommend them. They did and excellent job on the rings and the price was very reasonable. I thought I as going to have to pay hundreds of dollars for it but that wasn't the case at all. Excellent service, I plan on going back to them any time I need something engraved.

WOW! I had been searching for fancy little soaps to use as wedding favors. This husband-and-wife team hand-make soaps and candles.

I found Amanda based on a recommendation from my cake baker! So you KNOW she is good, if another baker says "don't get my cookies, go to Sweet Bella!" I originally wanted to use macaroons for my favors from my cake baker (Sweet Fix), but she advised macaroons don't hold well, and she thinks cookies from Sweet Bella was a much better option! She said hers are the only cookies she would recommend. And they didn't disappoint! I ordered 100 cookies since the RSVPs were trickling in, and I had no idea what my final number would be. Ended up I only need 75, so I was thinking I would have a lot left over. Sooooo not the case! People were taking MULTIPLE cookies! They were so good! Amanda gave me lots of options for designs and then customized them based on our colors and theme. She was great to work with and I am sad I only got 1 cookie, but the guests loved every single one! Thanks Amanda!

Kelly created the cutest cookie favors for our wedding. They came beautifully bagged and tied with a ribbon. They served as a great midnight snack for our guests, and we were left with a few to take on our honeymoon! Kelly was really easy to work with, and very responsive. Highly recommend!

The personalized, gourmet, chocolate covered pretzel favors were great! She brought extra in case some broke in transit, which was an appreciated idea I wouldn't have thought of. I highly recommend her.

Got welcome bags as well as chocolate truffles from them for favors. Beautiful packaging and very professional and nice. Prices seemed reasonable for what we were getting. Highly recommend them.
