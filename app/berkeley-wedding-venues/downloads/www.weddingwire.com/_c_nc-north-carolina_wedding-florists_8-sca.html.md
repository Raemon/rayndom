My daughter had a wedding venue in West North Carolina last weekend and usually they say it’s the bride that makes the wedding and yes, that was the case ;) but the flowers were absolutely amazing. It’s like makeup on a lady…. Enhanced the whole experience! I was floored how gorgeous they were and the setup of how they were placed etc ..I asked her who did them and she said Whimsical Blooms farm and what was wild is that the flowers were just that… Whimsical! They were absolutely gorgeous! Highly recommend that florist to anyone who needs gorgeous flowers and talent since they were all put together so beautifully! 10/10

We had the best experience with Stargazers! Kristi was so responsive and adjusted every time we changed our minds (which was a lot). Everything turned out so beautifully, and we got so many compliments. They even shipped a bouquet for my bridal portraits ahead of time! We definitely recommend!

Toni was extremely professional and a joy to work with for our event. Her attention to detail was very evident and we appreciated all the little personal touches she added to make it extra special. She responded quickly to all of our questions and was eager to make sure we were happy with the selections we chose. I highly recommend her services for all of your floral needs!

Flowers Plus did a WONDERFUL job with my wedding and I would highly recommend them to any couple! From bouquets to centerpieces to venue decor, all of the arrangements were breathtaking and even more beautiful than I had envisioned. Most, if not all, of our guests commented on how gorgeous the flowers were. Joel was attentive and easy to communicate with throughout the entire planning process. The Flowers Plus team was prompt, professional, and a joy to work with on our wedding day. We could not be happier with their services and cannot thank them enough for making our day so beautiful!

Brittany was fantastic to work with! She created exactly what I wanted for my wedding day! My bouquet was stunning, and the centerpieces were just as pictured! We planned our wedding from KY and she was always available to answer my questions and assist with any needs I had for the wedding! You won't regret working with this florist!

I struggle with the rating of this review because the planning aspect of An English Flower Cottage's services was phenomenal. During the planning process, I worked with Mandy as the planner and the florist. Everything was great and she helped me find multiple vendors, even within three weeks of my wedding when I needed to find a new photographer. We had come up with the colors, made arrangements in her shop, and made a Pinterest board together. I could reach her via text, email, phone, we even had Zoom meetings. However, around the same three week mark that I needed a new photographer, Mandy told me that she was not going to be at my rehearsal dinner or my wedding and that instead it was going to be her daughter-in-law, Chassey, who would be taking over my wedding. I was assured that Chassey had been working with Mandy for 12 years and that it would all be great. This made me a little nervous, especially after the photographer incident, but I trusted Mandy so I said okay. They had a woman make my seating display for me, so I sent Chassey an inspiration photo of one I liked that was simple and used wax stickers to hold the seating charts to the mirror display. I was told my display would use wax stickers with the initial of our last name on them, but was never sent a photo of what they looked like. They ended up being cork with a sticker 'C' on them. Not at all the same thing and not at all in line with what our wedding looked like. I asked for a dress form to be brought on the night of the rehearsal dinner that way we could steam my dress that night, but that did not happen. And then when flowers were brought over, they were not the right colors, the ground arch was way smaller than I thought it was going to be and the arrangements that were at the top of the aisle were supposed to be an 'L' shape around the back of the chairs, but they ended up being just one flower pot on each side. This may have been so that Chassey could make the ground arch larger like I asked, but I am not sure and now have green plastic flower pots in all of my photos. The ground arch also had plastic flower pots showing. And when I asked why the flowers were white and not the colors Mandy and I agreed upon, the explanation I was given by Chassey was that those were the colors Mandy told her to use. The flowers were still beautiful, but since they were white they looked green against my champagne wedding dress, which is why I told Mandy I did not want white flowers. Mandy and I also discussed a bubble exit, and when my photographer asked what time we were doing this, Chassey said she had no idea this was in the plans. When it was time to clean up, Mandy did come and she told me that the reason my flowers were not the right color was because she had to refuse the original flowers that came in as they "looked like they had been used as a fly swatter." I am glad I did not have flowers that were actively falling apart, but it would have been nice to have been made aware of this beforehand instead of being surprised an hour before the ceremony. The flowers are not the important piece of a wedding so I did not make a big deal about it as it was all still beautiful. Everything worked out and Chassey did a great job with planning, communicating with vendors, and day of coordinating, it's just that communication fell through between her, Mandy, and myself along the way and it would have been nice to have some kind of explanation for any one of the mishaps that happened.

Michelle was one of the best decisions I made to bring to my vendor team for my wedding. She is kind, knowledgeable, hospitable, and a plethora of other great things! She made sure everything was exactly how I wanted it and handled all the details of my wedding day. She did it all - setting up and breaking down personal decor, coordinating with my other vendors (ex. handled Publix bakery drop off while I was getting ready. I could not recommend her more!
