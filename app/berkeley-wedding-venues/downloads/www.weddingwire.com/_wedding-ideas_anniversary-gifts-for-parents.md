If you’re newly engaged or recently wed, you're probably starting to realize exactly just how much goes into a marriage—it takes hard work, dedication, and a persistent willingness to commit to one another through the years, especially when life throws curveballs at you! You might even have an entirely new level of respect for your parents and their marriage, especially when their anniversary rolls around. When it's time to celebrate, these anniversary gifts for parents will show them just how much they mean to you (and how grateful you are for them paving the way). Whether you're looking for sentimental anniversary presents, practical options your parents will use again and again, or unique anniversary gifts to totally surprise mom and dad, you can start your shopping right here. 

## Custom Puzzle

This unique anniversary gift for parents is the perfect way to surprise news junkies on their special day. Customize the puzzle by choosing the cover of the  _New York Times_ from your parents' wedding date or other significant moment (the front page archives go all the way back to 1851!).
