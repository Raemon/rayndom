Hire Amelia for your Wedding! 

Amelia was a fantastic addition to our ceremony. We hired her as a solo violinist. Her music was so beautiful and perfect for our day. She was always responsive and so helpful. She has a wide range of music she can play. Highly recommend! I would book her for another event in the future too.

Wonderful Addition to Our Wedding! 

Amelia was one of the first vendors we booked. She was so professional and extremely easy to work with. She offered us tons of options and helped us make thoughtful selections artistically combining traditional and contemporary music. She even hopped on a few planning calls so that she was prepared for the day of. She played at both our ceremony and cocktail hour. Her music was lovely, and everyone enjoyed it. We are super glad we hired her!

Amazing Talent

Amelia truly made my wedding ceremony possible. Without her, I wouldn’t have had music! She gracefully played the violin that it brought tears to so many peoples eyes. The talent she showed left me speechless. She was on time (actually early!), efficient, & played oh so perfectly. She was very easy to work with & professional. Communicating with her was like a dream. She always answered my texts within the hour & was very patient with me & all of my questions. She was very responsible of the time that we had & was on key with all of the walk downs during our ceremony. I am highly recommending her to others. Her prices are also affordable! I am so thankful that I had her to play so effortlessly at my wedding. She truly made it magical. 🩷 THANK YOU AGAIN!!  
  
(She played an interlude & 3 songs at our wedding. )

Ms. Amelia Muccia

Amelia was absolutely wonderful performing at our wedding on 10.5.23. She was responsive all year leading up to our big day - accommodated our requests for certain songs and played them beautifully. It was a true honor to have her perform at our wedding and we would recommend her to everyone!

Hire Amelia!

Amelia was an absolute dream to work with. She was super understanding of me changing our ceremony music last minute and was able to find a keyboardist to accompany her when we decided that an additional instrument would compliment our music selection. I would definitely hire her again.

Lovely to work with and incredibly talented!

Amelia is lovely to work with and an incredibly talented violinist! She played at our wedding ceremony and cocktail hour, and the music was a true highlight for our guests. Amelia was proactive and communicative throughout the planning process, and she worked seamlessly with other musicians. Amelia even made a special arrangement of "Love Shack" for us as a special request :) I highly recommend working with Amelia!
