I had an absolutely wonderful experience at Rivard Fine Jewelry in Lexington! From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed. Margaret, my salesperson, was phenomenal—she was warm, patient, and incredibly knowledgeable. She really listened to what I wanted and guided me through the options without ever making me feel rushed or pressured. Her expertise and genuine kindness made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Thanks to Margaret, I found a piece that I truly love and will treasure for years to come. The quality and craftsmanship at Rivard are outstanding, and their customer service is second to none. If you’re looking for beautiful jewelry and an exceptional shopping experience, I highly recommend Rivard Fine Jewelry.

Had a very good experience with St John's and Myers purchasing an Engagement Ring and a Wedding Band! They are extremely helpful and nice people. They did a fantastic job of giving knowledge and opinions without making me feel pressured. At other Jewelry stores, I have been helped by workers who will only tell you what you want to hear and it does not end up helpful at all. St John and Myers are very knowledgeable about their products and everything they sell is high quality. My Fiancee and I are especially happy with her vintage Engagement ring. We really value that it is both Environmentally sustainable and One of a Kind!! (And of course I think it is very pretty too!!!)

Heather at Koerbers is so sweet every time we go in there! I'm so happy with my ring, everything in the store is so beautiful! Heather was willing to work with us to get us what we wanted at a price we could afford. She was also very knowledgeable about the rings and diamonds making us feel very confident in our decision. We continue to shop here for our jewelry needs and have recommended friends here as well!

Working with Bill Brundage jewelers was a fantastic experience. The options to design your own as well as what they have in store are phenomenal. My engagement ring was custom made and it’s nice to know that there is not a duplicate ring out there! Teresa helped us make selections and was very knowledgeable and guided us in the right direction. I get many, many compliments on my engagement ring and the wedding bands look beautiful with it!

We wanted something that was unique for our wedding bands and would hold up especially with my husband in the military. GDA was able to have our rings personalized to what we wanted. We saw two different rings that we wanted to combine different parts and they did that. Price was GREAT too.

My fiancé and I went to Mithril's to have a custom setting done for a stone he had already purchased. I had an idea of what I wanted, but Ray helped me to see what the best setting would be for this stone and for me. It was so easy to work with Mithrils and a pleasure. When a business has been going for over 35 years and doesn't need any social media or even a website, you know they're going to do a great job. I love my ring so much. Once we got everything settled, I had it in less than 2 weeks, and there was even a holiday in that time! Straight forward and not 'salesy'. Highly recommended.
