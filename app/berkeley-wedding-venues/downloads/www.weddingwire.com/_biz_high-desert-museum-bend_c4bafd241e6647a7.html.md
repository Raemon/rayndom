Amazing Experience

Working with the High Desert Museum was an absolute pleasure. It's an incredible venue with lots of different options locations for the ceremony, reception, after party, and photos. Their team cares about you and your wedding day, and you can tell that they strive to cater to whatever you'd need. Their setup for our dinner, cake cutting, and toasts was beautiful. Their food was absolutely delicious and was made in house, we had 2 guest with strict vegan and gluten free diets, and the meal that was provided to them was, "The best meal they've ever had". Overall, the experience was amazing, we can't wait to come back with our future little ones and relish in the memories we made here.

WOW is what I have to say about the High Desert Museum, and about their staff-especially Molly! They have a can-do, make it happen attitude that put me at complete peace for my wedding day. They coordinated the most beautiful ceremony and reception ever. The whole wedding was GORGEOUS. Such a beautiful place!!! Highly recommended.

A unique and spectacular setting for a wedding and/or reception, either indoors or out. A beautiful "modern rustic" interior, with access to exhibits (historical, cultural, geographic, wildlife) detailing Oregon history and the High Desert environment. Staff is easy to work with and has a readily-available set of vendors to refer you to. They are all very accommodating.

I cannot say enough good about the museum! The staff was professional and on top of every thing. All of the communications had quick responses. The museum was open to all of our guests but closed to the public. Overall, we had a great experience!

We looked at lots of venues and by far, this is the coolest place. It has great value. The museum is closed to the public but will be open during the wedding to our guests. There are several options for ceremony areas and reception too. It is a great value for the amount of money we paid.

Excellent venue for our wedding in May! Not only are they very reasonably priced, but they provided a coordinator, day-of contact for all of our needs, numerous other staff members to help, and a BEAUTIFUL venue with full access to the grounds AND animal presentations! It was truly the wedding of our dreams and every aspect of the Museum brought that to life. We did have one little glitch when our timing ran late and our Porcupine animal encounter was brought out early, but I don't think anyone even noticed :) Please consider this amazing venue for your event, and all of the money goes back to the museum!
