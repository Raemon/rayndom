A Perfect Addition

I'll start by saying Ting was one of the best additions to our wedding and we couldn't recommend her more highly. For anyone planning a wedding, you know how many moving pieces there are, and having someone you can trust handle any of it can be a relief. Not only is Ting incredibly talented, but she made the entire process from our initial meeting to playing us down the aisle as stress-free as it could have been.  
  
We started with a meeting where Ting played a few songs she recommended to give us an idea of what to expect and what our options were. After that, we gave her a few of our requests, which included a classic Chinese love song as well as a fiddle song; both of which were incorporated beautifully. We had a check-in a few weeks before the wedding to make sure everything was on track, and at that point it became apparent we could focus our anxiety elsewhere because she had it well in hand. We're so happy we chose Ting for such a special task, and we couldn't imagine anyone else handling it as wonderfully as she did.

Amazing Harpist

Ting helped make our wedding ceremony feel like a Disney love story. We asked her to perform a medley of Disney love songs and it was magical. We had a 30 minute video call with Ting where she explained her process and even performed a few samples for us to hear. We highly recommend her. Thank you Ting!

An amazing add to our wedding day!

Ting was great to work with! She provided a beautiful ambiance to our special day. The walk down the aisle felt magical as she played her harp.   
  
She was very professional. We set up a 30 minute intro call to talk through her services. She also performed a few samples on the harp for us.   
  
We definitely recommend her for music during your ceremony. Thank you, Ting!

Amazing Harpist

Ting was so easy to work with. We started with a 30 minute video call where she talked through her packages and thoughts around what we envisioned for our wedding. She also played a few sample pieces live on the harp. The harp sounded great over the call, but even more beautiful in real life. We highly recommend Ting for your wedding ceremony!

Summer 2024 wedding at Hammond Castle

Kristine (Ting) played more than a dozen songs beautifully during our wedding ceremony, the cocktail hour, etc. at our wedding at Hammond Castle in summer 2024. Ting's harp music made the day so much more special for my wife and me along with our 100+ guests, many of whom commented on how wonderful her music was at this special event. She was also very professional and a pleasure to deal with from the first time that we met her. We would wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone who would like to retain a harpist for a wedding or other special event.

An Unforgettable Experience! 

I had the pleasure of hiring Ting for our wedding, and I can confidently say it was one of the best decisions we made! Her music set the perfect tone for our ceremony, creating a serene and romantic atmosphere that complemented every moment.  
  
She was incredibly professional, responding quickly to all inquiries and working closely with us to curate a song list that perfectly matched our vision. Her performance was flawless, and the sound of the harp was both soothing and enchanting, adding a touch of elegance to the entire event.  
  
Ting exceeded all our expectations, and I would highly recommend her to anyone looking to elevate their special day with something truly magical.

Amazing Ceremony Music

I hired Ting to play at the church for my daughter’s wedding. She performed for 30 minutes prior to the ceremony and then the processional and recessional. She is a gifted artist. The music was simply beautiful. My daughter requested Across the Stars (love theme from Star Wars) to walk down to. Ting learned the piece and executed it flawlessly. We requested a Disney love song medley for the recessional and just at the moment the Groom kissed his Bride, Beauty and the Beast was playing; it was absolutely perfect! So many commented on how much they enjoyed the harp music. I would highly recommend Ting if anyone is considering a harpist!
