Just because you been hurt and broken doesn’t mean all women will. Not all men cheat and I’m sorry you see the world that way. You’re one bitter woman commenting on random people’s post putting them down like it’s your choice.

She better not come crying to us when she’s a single mom while still living with her “husband” while she is crying in the feces and spit up stained while couch eating ice cream from the carton asking herself “why didn’t I just listen to Gladys and Desiree”

A wedding celebration is a joyful and unforgettable occasion that brings together family and friends to honor the love and commitment shared between two people. It is a day filled with heartfelt moments, meaningful traditions, and beautiful memories that will be cherished for a lifetime. From the ceremony to the reception, every detail reflects the couple’s unique story and the beginning of their journey together. Surrounded by the warmth and support of loved ones, the wedding celebration marks not just the joining of two individuals, but the creation of a new chapter filled with hope, happiness, and love.

If you weren't a prepubescent internet Troll with limited life knowledge and a faux drag pic you would know getting married IS BUSINESS. Money. Legality. Government bonuses and penalties. Don't be naive and get hung up on emotional things like cheating, silly child.

Oh honey, you think cheating is the only thing a man can do? You’re the naive one, and you sound incredibly angry and more bitter than I do. Why are you even here if you’re already married anyway, it isn’t giving “happy bride” the way you think. You’re proving my point on why women shouldn’t get married, if we’re being honest.

Just keep repeating to yourself in the mirror, "I am more than my daddy issues. I am more than my daddy issues" and one day you might believe you have only control over yourself. Sending you the gift of self-love and self-knowledge.🤞💞🪞🪩

The “daddy issues” propaganda is tired, yawn. If you’re so happy you should probably get off of this app and go be a good wife to your beloved husband and leave me alone and stop projecting because you know it’s true, you just don’t want to admit it. Sending YOU the gift of self love and self knowledge and to not be so male centered. Have a good one! I’ll see you soon when the divorce starts happening because you’ll probably be whining on here!
