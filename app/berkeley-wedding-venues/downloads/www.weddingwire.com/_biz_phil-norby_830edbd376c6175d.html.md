Everything I Needed

Phil is seriously a hidden gem! Right from the get-go he was knowledgeable, helpful, and all-around easy to work with! He responded to emails timely and never left me hanging. I actually saw him perform before I booked him just to make sure he was what I was looking for and he is an excellent musician. After I saw him play, I booked him that night! The week before the wedding, Phil called me so we could go over all the details and square away what song were to be played and not played. I booked Phil to do my whole wedding day of music, so he played guitar and sang for the ceremony and cocktail hour (along with one of his violinist friends) and DJed for the reception. Since he has worked so many weddings before he knew what questions to ask me and knew what to point out in my timeline. Phil learned some songs for the ceremony and even sang/played our first dance song! The music was so magical for the ceremony, I was drawn out of the moment during my ceremony just for a second because the music was so surreal. Then at the cocktail hour, they played more music, and everyone said it felt just like a cozy pub (we had a hobbit-themed wedding, so this was perfect!) Then when he was DJing he played great music that we as a couple wanted to hear but also read the crowd and played what they responded well to. As a musician, he is a very talented and hardworking virtuoso. As a professional, he is kind, thoughtful, funny, and an excellent person to work with. If you want a little more personal touch to your wedding, hire Phil Norby!

The perfect DJ

Phil is an extremely talented individual from playing guitar, singing or playing DJ he knocked it out of the park. He is extremely responsive and wanted to know our expectations for our wedding. He is a very fun, outgoing and genuine person. We would recommend Phil for anyone’s wedding or other events.

Our Wedding

Phil was the absolute best! He played music for our ceremony, officiated our ceremony with outstanding personal touches about us and played his original song, Battlecry Lullaby, for our first dance! Phil is a true professional and I recommend him to everyone I meet! Thanks again, Phil! You were absolutely amazing and we are so glad we had you with us on our special day!

Talented and Professional 

Hiring Phil Norby for our wedding really elevated our special day. Starting form the very beginning communication with Phil was a breeze he gave us multiple ways to contact him and he kept in touch with us until the wedding. He was very flexible when our timeline kept changing and allowed us to change our package last minute.  
  
His talented cannot be understated. Phil was able to learn the acoustics to our first dance, the mother-son dance, and the daddy-daughter dance in under two weeks. Our wedding guests loved Phil and our dance floor stayed filled the entire night. The service was so good I want to get divorced just to remarry and hire Phil one more time.

Hire Phil! You’ll be so glad you did!

Phil was a fantastic find for our wedding day! He is very responsive and accommodating. He not only played guitar for our ceremony and reception but also bought a brand new ukulele when I asked him to play a ukulele song for me to walk down the aisle to. He is very talented and made all my visions for wedding music come to life! We would highly recommend him if you’re looking for a live music option! 10/5 stars!!!

Great Experience and Definitely Recommend!

Phil performed live and DJ-ed at our wedding. We had no idea how to approach our wedding music but he made the process so easy for us. Phil met with us to learn more about our tastes and helped outline for us what music we needed to pick for the ceremony and reception. He worked directly with our venue on logistics which took a lot off our minds. The transitions, timing and flow of the music felt seamless. The live music was exactly what we had in mind - we loved it - and the DJ portion was so fun. I would absolutely recommend working with Phil to others. He listened to what we wanted, was flexible, and took care of things. Despite the hot sun beating down on him most of the evening, he had a smile on his face and a great attitude the whole night!

Wonderful addition to cocktail hour!

We had Phil sing during our cocktail hour for our reception. We got SO many compliments, it added such a nice touch and guests definitely noticed. Phil was fantastic to work with, he was super flexible, cognizant of our budget, and played the exact type of music we wanted without putting the stress on us for picking a playlist. I’d definitely recommend Phil for an amazing addition to your wedding, he would be great for a ceremony musician too!

Phil's a Master at his Craft!

Wedding planning gets hectic and my wife and I certainly had our hands full. We reached out to Phil and with a few consults and laid back discussions, we had an outline of what we were planning on doing. Phil was fantastic at filling in the gaps and helping us make the whole process easier with ample advise. On top of all that, he is an extremely talented musician and killed it at our wedding (be sure to request some of his originals)!   
  
Thanks again Phil!
