We stumbled upon Pat and Annabelle while wandering the streets of New Orleans for the first time — the clicking of their vintage typewriters and love poems on custom paper sheets pulled us right in. We joked right then, “They have to be at our wedding someday.” And they were. Watching our guests light up as they read their custom poems was pure magic — a perfect mix of whimsy, romance, and memory we’ll hold onto forever.

I purchased spa wraps for my bridal party as one of their gifts. We received some many compliments about them. Chrissy was a pleasure to work with and always remained in contact. Due to some of my girls being plus size, their robes were on back order so it took me a little longer to get received the robes. However, Chrissy kept me abreast and all the robes arrived on time for my wedding. I can’t say enough great things about Chrissy and will definitely encourage everyone to shop at her Etsy shop! I will definitely be back!

This company is amazing. I first placed an order with a cheaper company (WePrint101) in December, who stole my money and after 2 1/2 months, finally provided me with only half of my order that was incorrect and a horrible product. I contacted Leslie at Secondline Handkerchiefs/Backyard Printing and she was extremely helpful and professional. She provided me a proof within a day and my order was on my doorstep within a week. The graphic and quality of print was amazing and my only regret was that I didn't place my order with them back in December, when initially shopping around. Don't hesitate to use this company....remember...you get what you pay for when you try to go the cheap route. Thank you for making my beautiful wedding favors!

I purchased a custom wedding gown hanger from the Back Porch Shoppe {on Etsy}, and I absolutely loved it when it arrived! The color was perfect. It was vintage and totally my style; not too shabby chic. My dress looked lovely on it. They have other cute items, so I may be purchasing from them again very soon. Couldn’t be happier!

The ladies here are very helpful and the shop has a nice selection to choose from. I liked that they had some styles that I hadn't seen everywhere and that the sales lady listened to what I said . I wasn't really sure what I was looking for in a dress, but with help, was able to find it here. I found everything I needed !

Based on Amy's portfolio we were sure her style was exactly what we wanted. And after meeting her she was an absolute pleasure to work with! She was punctual, professional and gave us so many stunning photographs of our wedding. We're so glad we picked her and we both would recommend her to anyone looking for a photographer.
