I had my wedding reception for about 150 guests here in June 2023 and have nothing but good things to say about the venue. The cost to rent it is very reasonable for all that you get. The building is clean, beautiful, and in a great location with plenty of parking. Your rental gets you access to the courtyard and two banquet rooms. I was able to set up outdoor games, use the in-house technology for a photo show, borrow a few easels, and use one room as the "escape from the music" room. Most wedding rentals I looked at only include one room. My guests loved being able to spread out. One other perk of all these rooms is that you can easily host both a ceremony and a reception and have contingency rooms in the event of any bad weather (the courtyard space is typically the best spot for ceremonies). The facility manager, Steven, was a pleasure to work with. He was very responsive, flexible, and understanding with all my questions and requests. It is evident that he has helped plan for a lot of weddings at the facility--his knowledge and advice was extremely helpful. The facility staff who were present throughout our set up and event were great as well. If you book at Thompson, you will have to use their catering partner, Catering Creations, but they were good to work with as well.

I could not begin to describe how amazing all of the staff at Vintage Ballroom was. They all made sure that what my husband and I wanted was achieved! Huge shout out to Johannah, who was in charge that evening for making sure that we were happy, even with our DJ who was being incredibly difficult and unprofessional. If I had to do my wedding over again I would pick vintage ballroom EVERY SINGLE TIME.

So far I have had a great experience with the DelRay. Amanda, the wedding coordinator, is super nice! She was able to put a table together with a table cloth so I could test out one of my table centerpiece ideas. I am super excited for our big day to come!!

We had a full open bar through 1316 Jones St. Beverage Company. We had 2 bartenders for about 100 adults, and had no complaints about wait times for drinks. The best part is that they buy back unused alcohol with no restocking fee, so we ended up with a refund check that arrived less than a week after our wedding. 1316 Jones gave us recommendations for beers, wines, liquors, and mixers, but we were able to fully customize to our tastes.
