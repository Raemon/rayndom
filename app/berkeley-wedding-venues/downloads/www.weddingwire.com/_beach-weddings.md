## Beach Wedding

There’s nothing quite as romantic as saying your vows while digging your toes into warm sand as dramatic waves crash nearby. A beach wedding is a dream come true for many couples, but this idyllic event isn’t a total breeze to pull off. Make sure you start planning your beach wedding early and understand the unique challenges of this waterfront venue.

## Destination Beach Wedding or Local Slice of Heaven?

When planning a beach wedding, the first big choice you’ll need to make is whether to claim a local stretch of sand for the festivities or travel to an exotic corner of the planet for a [destination wedding](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/destination-weddings--t8). Your [wedding budget](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/wedding-budget.html) will likely be the deciding factor.

If you have the funds, a destination beach wedding can be an unforgettable experience that lets you explore a hidden piece of paradise with your closest friends and family members. If you do choose a destination wedding, it’s a good idea to hire a local [wedding planner](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planners) who can help you choose the best beach wedding venue and local [vendors](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-vendors).

An excellent way to save money on your wedding without sacrificing any magic is to plan a beach wedding on a local public beach. Make sure you check the local regulations – you may need to reserve a section of beach for your ceremony. There may also be restrictions on what equipment you can bring.

Keep in mind that choosing to wed on a public beach means you’ll share the sand and waves with anyone who wants to visit that day. It may be a good idea to host your ceremony in the early morning or evening to avoid the crowds.

## Choose Your Beach Wedding Venue

Once you’ve chosen your beach, it’s time to find the perfect beach wedding venue. If you have the funds and love the idea of letting a professional staff handle the planning, look into hosting your ceremony and reception at a beach resort.

If you’re sticking with a public beach and want to find “beach wedding venues near me,” consider hosting your reception in a nearby [restaurant](https://www.weddingwire.com/restaurant-weddings) or [banquet hall](https://www.weddingwire.com/banquet-hall-weddings).

## What to Wear to Your Beach Wedding

You’ll want to choose lightweight, breathable fabrics for your beach wedding attire. Grooms and groomsmen should try light-colored linens or loose shirts and pants. Brides would do well with shorter [dresses](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/dresses) so their hems don’t drag in the sand. Keep in mind that it’s often windy at the beach, so keep the veil at home and choose a dazzling updo instead of free-flowing tresses.

## Always Have a Backup Plan

Make sure you have a Plan B ready to go if Mother Nature doesn’t cooperate with your beach wedding plans. You might rent a [wedding tent](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-event-rentals), which can protect guests from rain or provide shade on a hot day. You may also want to keep a local hotel or restaurant on standby just in case the weather turns.

At WeddingWire, we can help you find the perfect beach wedding venues, whether you want to say “I do” at your favorite local beach or on a Caribbean Island. Take a look at all our top beach wedding venues today.
