We can’t recommend enough!

We got married at Rosemont Manor and had our reception in the carriage house on Dec. 5th. 2025, and it was absolutely perfect! From the time we toured the venue we were confident that this was the perfect venue for us! Our free tour was almost two hours being guided around by the owner getting to hear about the history of the property, various options for weddings and events, and overall just polite conversation. The staff asked us questions and really seemed like they wanted to get to know us as a couple and help us bring our vision to life. All of the staff we encountered during the almost two years of planning for our wedding were super kind, and they made coordinating everything so much easier. They take out the stress of finding vendors with their recommended vendor list. We ended up booking most or our vendors from this list and they all were a delight to work with. Felicia was our 30 day out and day of coordinator, and we can’t recommend her enough. She was both helpful in guiding us with decisions and helping us figure out how to coordinate what we envisioned. She was super attentive the month leading up with offering plenty of flexibility for phone calls to go over things and she took so many tasks off our hands during that last month. She was super easy to communicate with and she was there the entire wedding day helping us keep on schedule and making sure things ran smoothly! We can’t recommend Rosemont and their staff more!

Highly Recommend Rosemont Manor as a Wedding Venue

Rosemont Manor is a beautiful place to get married. The property itself is stunning, it embodies the natural landscape of the region and a historical elegance of the countryside. A huge draw for our choice to get married here was the opportunity to have a large part of our wedding party and guests stay on-site. Rosemont Manor has 11 rooms, named after famous people who have visited the property in the past. These rooms vary in size but they all share an elegance and historical significance which is rare. On top of this, there are three guest houses on the property. While older buildings, they have been updated and modernized to include A/C and heating and other amenities. The houses are unique and a little quirky, with some of our guests sharing rooms and bathrooms. These are perfect for families or friends who don’t mind sharing spaces. But the convenience of having them stay on-site cannot be matched. This reduced the need for shuttles, hotel blocks, and generally made it easier for us to plan the wedding and for our guests to enjoy the wedding. This also allowed for us to not feel rushed to have to leave the venue since we were staying on site. Many venues have hard cut-off times and often you see the wedding party having to clean up their signs, presents, and any other items at the end of the night (sometimes 10 or 11 pm). In our case we were able to take our time and even do a lot of that gathering of items in the morning, this allowed everyone to be able to actually enjoy themselves instead of worrying about wrapping up. Who wants to clean up at the end of one of the most important and emotional days of their lives?   
  
The venue was accommodating to what we wanted and is quite flexible to make things work the way you want them to and in line with your budget. As opposed to many venues, they are quite transparent about costs and what you are able to do for your wedding. We loved having our ceremony outside, in front of the Manor portico, the cocktail hour under the portico and inside the Manor, and then moving inside to the Carriage House for the reception. The carriage house also has a lovely terrace with a firepit which was a big hit for the chilly night of an October wedding.   
  
Our coordinator, Colette Hawes, was terrific to work with. Her kindness, patience, and suggestions were invaluable as we planned and prepared for all the big to do’s and the little details. We had regular meetings and calls to go over everything, her advice was crucial to getting the right vendors in place and constantly updating the timeline. It was a pleasure not just to work with her, but to be able to rely on her with our questions and worries. Weddings are an emotional and logistical rollercoaster and it helps to have someone with experience in wedding planning, and with the venue specifically, who can guide you. Collette embodies this and we would always recommend her to anyone looking to get married at Rosemont. She had along with her, excellent staff that handled things like parking and welcoming guests, room assignments, and general help on the day of.   
  
The owner, William Genda, was the first person we met with. He spent a considerable amount of time with us to answer all of our questions and he quickly understood what we were looking for and the type of wedding we wanted. He sold us on a vision that matched that and demonstrated how Rosemont could be that place. Looking back, they were patient and flexible throughout the process and shared wonderful resources that helped tremendously, they were adaptive to our budget needs and our vision and helped make sure we had an incredible, beautiful, and memorable wedding. Again, we strongly recommend Rosemont as a beautiful and historic venue, the staff for their expertise, dedication, and hard work, and the owner William for his experience, honesty, and thoroughness.

The Best Run Wedding (According to our guests) 

We definitely spent more than we were quoted, however, the benefit of experience, a network of good vendors that are used to working together, and high quality production work by all the staff was worth it.   
The Rosemont was beautiful; provided a good wedding to send-off brunch experience for all of us; and had lots of items available as free/rentals/cool ideas.   
Our guests noted it was very well run. They also said it was one of the most beautiful and happiest weddings they had ever been to. We had no stress on the day, just a lot of joy and happy guests.

Highly recommend Rosemont Manor as a wedding venue

Rosemont Manor was the venue for our daughter's recent wedding. We booked the property for Friday and Saturday night and it was an amazing weekend. The rehearsal dinner was in the manor house dining room....very elegant and comfortably welcoming. It was followed by a welcome reception using the dining room, portico and grounds, as well as the manor 'great hall' and living room.....plenty of space for people to mingle and many, many guests commented on the beauty of the venue. Family members stayed at the manor house....beautiful accommodations and delicious breakfasts, and friends of the bride and groom stayed in the cottages. They all talked about enjoying walking/running on the grounds, playing volleyball, and relaxing. Saturday's wedding cocktail reception on the portico was breathtakingly beautiful and the reception in the carriage house was spectacular. Collette, our wedding planner, took care of many details in the months up to the special date and on the 'day of'. She and her team seemed to work magic as they set up in the short windows of time when we were all away, and they wrapped things up beautifully so that it was easy to collect our items and load them on Sunday morning. I highly recommend Rosemont Manor for anyone looking for a beautiful and welcoming venue.

Fantastic venue

We hosted our wedding at the Historic Rosemont Manor in June 2025 and could not have been happier with this venue. Not only are the grounds breathtaking, the rooms beautiful, and the food delicious - the staff were all wonderful! From touring almost 2 years prior, through the full planning process, everyone was friendly and very responsive. Our planner/coordinator Sarah was INCREDIBLE! Sarah was always available for questions and bouncing ideas leading up to the wedding, and the day of she ensured everything ran perfectly smooth and stress-free. Sarah and Rosemont gave us our dream wedding and we could not be more thankful and pleased by how everything turned out! If you are considering getting married at Rosemont, you will not regret it!

Get Married at the Historic Rosemont, you won’t regret it! 

We had the absolute pleasure of working with Sarah at The Historic Rosemont for our weekend wedding, and we cannot say enough wonderful things about her. From the moment we started planning, Sarah made us feel supported, understood, and truly excited about every detail of our special day.  
  
She is the definition of grace under pressure, calm, organized, responsive, and always two steps ahead. Whether it was coordinating vendors, managing the timeline, or making sure every guest felt taken care of, Sarah handled it all seamlessly. Her knowledge of the venue, paired with her attention to detail and eye for design, helped us bring our vision to life even better than we imagined.  
  
What stood out most was how much Sarah genuinely cared about our wedding. She treated us like more than just clients, she treated us like family. From the rehearsal dinner through the final farewell brunch, everything ran smoothly, and we were able to truly enjoy the moment without any stress.  
  
Our weekend at The Rosemont was magical, and Sarah was a huge part of making it that way. If you’re planning a wedding at this beautiful venue, know that you’re in the best hands with Sarah. She’s a gem, and we are endlessly grateful for everything she did for us.  
  
— with Love, Katherine & Redouane

Beautiful wedding weekend at Historic Rosemont Manor!❤️

Historic Rosemont was the perfect venue for my Daughter and her Fiancé! Family and friends celebrated the entire weekend beginning with the rehearsal dinner on Friday evening straight through to a Mothers’ Day brunch on Sunday morning. Our wedding planner, Sarah did everything for us, and I do mean everything. She is creative, patient and detail oriented. The entire staff at Rosemont did a great job. We used a couple of the vendors they suggested and were very pleased with them as well. If there was something that didn’t go right, it was never noticed. Everyone was so pleased.

Amazing wedding weekend!

We had our wedding at Rosemont and it was a wonderful experience! My husband and I keep saying how much fun we had and how beautiful the property and Manor are. We were so lucky to have Collette as our planner. Collette was not only kind, but personable, intentional, and proactive. She brought our vision to life and gave great ideas that enhanced our whole experience.   
  
Working with Collette and Rosemont was unlike any other wedding vendor experience: she felt like family and Rosemont felt like a second home.   
  
We wanted to get married near wine country and at a property where our wedding party and families could all spend the night. It was a FANTASTIC weekend and we keep reliving it through photos and videos. Thank you, Collette and Rosemont, for an unforgettable wedding weekend! We are so appreciative of everything you did so that we could have an amazing wedding!
