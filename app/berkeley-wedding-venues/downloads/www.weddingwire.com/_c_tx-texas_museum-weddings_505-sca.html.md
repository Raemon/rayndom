We are so grateful and happy we went with the Texas Science and Natural History Museum for our wedding venue. It's a beautiful venue, and we love museums, so this place felt like the perfect place to have our ceremony and reception. Our photos and video are stunning! This place is also so cool for adults and kids. It was such a great experience for our guests (young and old) to walk through the exhibits and have access to the entire museum. Everyone had a lot of fun just enjoying the space. Alex, the Events Director, was responsive, kind, and easy to work with. We had a lot of questions, and Alex was great about getting back to us. During our wedding, Alex and all the museum staff were so helpful and friendly. Also, if you're looking to save a little on rentals, the museum had chairs and tables we were able to utilize for our wedding. We wanted our money to go towards supporting something that's good for the community, and this place is exactly that. We were so excited to have our wedding here, and now we are so grateful to have had such a gorgeous, iconic wedding! So many people told us it was the best wedding they've ever been to, and this venue definitely made it a special experience for us and our guests.

I can’t say enough about this venue! The museum staff and the room we used were perfect! Andrea helped us in so many ways. Her suggestions and recommendations on caterers and makeup artists helped make our wedding extra special.

We had our wedding in February with just 40 guests. We were able to hold the ceremony right outside of the Driscoll Villa and the reception inside. Laguna Gloria has been one of our favorite places in Austin and when looking for a venue it was out top choice. We were focused on making sure we had an easy indoor plan if it was really cold but also wanted something artsy with nature. In addition, being ADA accessible was super important - my dad is in a big power wheelchair and his comfort and ability to enjoy the venue was one of our top priorities. Laguna Gloria provided all of that for us. The area around the Villa was easy for dad to navigate, they also provided an additional ramp for one part of the Villa that is slightly raised. The elevator helped him access the different floors. Overall our wedding was more than we could have imagined. The venue is beautiful, our family loved being able to walk around during cocktail hour. With our size of wedding, the Villa was perfect. Our guitarist said it was one of the coolest wedding locations he's played at. We also worked with Austin Elite and Premier Events for catering staff and rentals and they were very familiar with the venue and made everything run perfectly smooth. We had two long banquet tables in the main room of the Villa for dinner. The buffet line for the cocktail hour and dinner was in the tea room. The bar was in the dining room. We had cocktail tables throughout for standing inside and outside. The string lights that are part of the venue permanently were perfect for evening lighting. If we had expected people to venture further from the Villa after the sun went down we would have wanted to rent more lights but we didn't need to for our size. With 40 people everything fit perfectly. We were also able to keep the decor simple because the building itself is already so naturally beautiful. Dominique at Laguna Gloria was super flexible with us. We planned our wedding super quickly (within 3 months) so that my dad could be there. We started out wanting to do their elopement package but our guest list quickly grew. She was patient with all of our emails and questions and decision making and worked with our coordinator (Epoch Events Co) to make sure we had a great wedding. Adding a few photos (by Sharayah and Ryan from Hereafter Films) to show the venue on February 1st.

Katyln and the UMLAUF team were fantastic to work with. UMLAUF was such a unique wedding venue filled with art and nature. If you are looking for a lush wedding filled with beautiful sights there is no better choice.

Texas Discovery Gardens and Two Sisters Catering or amazing on my special day. The venue facility is great because it has outside ceremony options plus the huge reception space inside. The floor to ceiling windows gift so much natural light. It’s also a blank space so you can make it what you want. The cost for the space was very affordable. The food is wonderful! Even from my first tasting, I was so pleased with how the food was prepared and served. Their staffing is wonderful and the price is fantastic as well! I would highly recommend the venue space and Two Sisters to anyone looking for a great space and caterer for their wedding or large party.

Jack Guenther Pavilion at the Briscoe was the perfect venue for our wedding! We loved taking portraits in the museum and the garden is perfectly manicured. The location right on the riverwalk cannot be beat, especially if you have a lot of out of town guests. I want to specifically thank their coordinator Daniel Gomez! Danny was such a joy to work with. He went above and beyond helping pass out dance floor props and even hyping us up during photos, he made sure everything was perfect and we are so grateful for his help.
