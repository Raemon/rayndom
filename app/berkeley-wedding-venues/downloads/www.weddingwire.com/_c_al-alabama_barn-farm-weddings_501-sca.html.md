The venue was beautiful! Amanda was AMAZING to work with! She paid attention to every detail and made our bride and bridal party feel so at ease! She was helpful throughout the entire day and took care of whatever our needs were. I highly recommend this venue and especially the wedding coordinator Amanda!

We couldn’t believe we found this beautiful place for an extraordinary price! Got the weekend package for our son and daughter in laws wedding. Everything was breathtaking, and the hospitality was top tier.

It is hard to put into words how perfect J&D Farms really is. There is not one thing I would change about our wedding day at this venue. The owners go over and beyond to ensure you are taken care of--from the time you book to the time you depart! If you are considering a farm as a venue, but don't want a "country" vibe, but rather a rustic elegance vibe, this is your venue. It's genuinely a dream of an experience and place to start your forever.

We choose The Stables at Juniper Farms for our wedding on March 14, 2020. There are not enough words to describe how perfect our day was. Shauna is so easy to work and communicate with. Any question was answered, and any need was met. She truly loves what she does, and it shows through all the small details her venue has to offer. Our wedding was an absolute dream. We are so thankful.

The ladies at Southern House and Garden went above and beyond for our dream wedding! We cannot say enough good things about the venue, everything was amazing and went exactly as planned, if not better. We were so thankful for the wedding day director Tina, she did an amazing job keeping us on track and following out requests. Terri she Angi made planning so easy and made our dream wedding happen. We wanted our dogs included in our wedding, so we were so excited that the venue did allow pets. The dogs started to get over heated and were taken to the air conditioning to cool down. Everyone had so much fun and we received so many compliments! The venue was so beautiful and I couldn’t imagine going with any other venue.

Our wedding day was an absolutely a dream come true. Shannon and Ken were an absolute dream to work with, they always responded quickly, made sure everything was taken care of, and always made sure to communicate with us no matter what. If we had to redo our wedding day, we would do it all over again at The Barn at Shady Grove. I highly recommend this team and venue for your wedding day!
