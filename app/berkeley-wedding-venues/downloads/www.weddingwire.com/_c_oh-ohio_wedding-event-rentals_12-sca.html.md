Carter and his team were incredibly helpful, responsive, and very reasonably priced for all the services they provided. They made the stress of wedding planning so much easier by handling drop-off and pick-up of all the tables and chairs we rented, and the entire process was simple and straightforward from start to finish. We loved working with them and would absolutely recommend them to any friends or family needing event rentals!

This is the last thing I thought I’d review—but the bathroom trailer was so impressive, I had to! Mr. Clean set up on time, the unit looked and smelled great, and it made everything feel more polished. Our outdoor wedding felt stress-free thanks to vendors like this. Highly recommend for grooms who want to impress the in-laws.

We were absolutely blown away by the work this floral company did for our event—especially on such short notice! Lelana truly brought our vision to life by incorporating fruit into every design, from show-stopping centerpieces to subtle, elegant accents on each table. She even created a custom piece for our drink station that cascaded beautifully from our water dispenser—such a unique detail that people are still talking about. Every element felt thoughtful, creative, and impactful. If you’re looking for that special touch that takes your event from ordinary to unforgettable, I can’t recommend them highly enough!

Royal flush brought a restroom to my wedding and it was well worth it. It was a hassle free booking process and they setup quickly. The unit was clean and had everything we needed. Not to mention it was heated so it stayed warm while it was chilly during the reception.

We absolutely loved the LED dance floor! Having a dedicated tech on site all day to adjust the lighting and set the perfect mood made such a difference. It was seamless, stunning, and one of the best additions we made — we truly couldn’t be happier!

When I first got engaged, I thought I could handle planning a wedding and a full-time job. After wading through the seemingly endless vendors and trying to get anyone from the venues to call us back, I knew I needed help. I went to high school with Meleka and knew she had a growing event planning business. I remembered she had great taste and was easy to get along with, so I picked up the phone and signed up for her full service package. Looking back, I can safely say this decision paid for itself and then some. I had always wanted an Old Hollywood wedding, but beyond that I was overwhelmed with decisions. Meleka made the entire process so much fun. She gave me several really solid options for each item on our to-do list, and then did all the groundwork setting up appointments around our schedules. She gave us vendors she trusts and has good relationships with, sometimes those who even gave us discounts for using MMJ. When we had vendors she didn't normally work with and who never followed through, Meleka stayed professional and focused, making sure everything came together. The most fun was the design process. Meleka was so talented at listening to what I wanted, wading through my Pinterest boards, and coming up with a final product at the end. I felt like anytime I couldn't verbalize what I wanted, she was right there with the answer. It was invaluable to have someone to bounce ideas off of, and I knew she would always give me her honest opinion. I will never forget walking into the reception room in the Columbus Museum of Art and seeing all our ideas put together - it was one of my favorite moments of the day. I think our guests described our wedding day the best. My dad said of Meleka's day-of-coordination, "She is so calm, cool and collected - makes it easy to enjoy ourselves." Another guest said, "This is truly a celebration of the two of you as a couple." And at the end of the night after all the amazing food, drinks and dancing, it seemed everyone said to

Alina's wide selection of decor, along with her creativity, is exactly what we needed to bring our wedding vision to life. For our Indian/Western fusion, we had two different ceremonies back to back in the same room, with only a brief intermission between them. Alina and her team made the space look stunning for both ceremonies, showing the utmost respect and appreciation for both religions and cultures. After the ceremonies, our reception was at a different venue altogether. When we walked into the reception hall for the first time, our jaws hit the floor because of how exquisite and perfect everything looked. Alina's talent, efficiency, and passion were on display all weekend, and she was absolutely instrumental in giving us our dream wedding. We highly recommend her!
