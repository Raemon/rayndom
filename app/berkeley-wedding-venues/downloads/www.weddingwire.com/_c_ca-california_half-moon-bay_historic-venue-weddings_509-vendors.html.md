We had contemplated on having our wedding at San Benito House before the unfortunate fire happened at their place. Kai was such an amazing partner, he went out of his way to continue to work with us and cater our wedding and rehearsal dinner at another venue. They really pulled out all of the stops for us! The food was excellent and the bar service was great. They brought so many different drink options and they worked with us to put the perfect menu together. I would highly recommend working with Kai at San Benito House and I wish them all the best and have my fingers crossed for a quick reopening!
