CoHost is Excellent

Working with CoHost for our wedding was an absolute dream come true. From our first meeting, where we sampled an array of delicious food options and exquisite cocktails, to the flawless execution of our big day, CoHost epitomized excellence in every aspect.  
  
Their culinary expertise is truly incredible. They didn’t just provide food; they created unforgettable memories with every bite. Our guests couldn't stop raving about the amazing dishes and top-notch service. Each dish was a testament to their commitment to quality and creativity, leaving a lasting impression on everyone.  
  
We chose to get married at our family ranch, which presented some unique logistical challenges. CoHost handled everything with remarkable professionalism and efficiency. They anticipated potential issues and had ready solutions, ensuring everything went smoothly. Their ability to adapt and deliver beyond expectations truly set them apart.  
  
My wedding day was perfect, and much of that perfection was thanks to CoHost. Their dedication, passion, and attention to detail made our celebration a seamless and joyous occasion. If you're looking for a caterer who will exceed your expectations and turn your event into a cherished memory, look no further than CoHost. They are simply the best at what they do.

Lights, DJ & End of Night Transportation

We used Cohost for our lighting, end of the evening transportation and DJ. Lighting enhanced the vibe of the evening, the Rolls that they got to leave in was luxury on wheels. We had a slight hiccup with the DJ- our original DJ had a medical emergency the day before the wedding and the replacement DJ, Brandon, did a great job! We were pleasantly surprised with how quickly the change over was taken care of and handled for us. Our guests had no idea and loved the energy of the entire evening.

Excellent food & great experience

I planned a fairly good-sized wedding at the very last minute and Jewel was all in! She was not intimidated at all by the shortened time line and never said no to anything I wanted! She and her staff were very professional, with timely responses and never baulked at crazy changes I made at the last minute. Hire her now! Thank you Jewel.

Amazing vendor!!!

Working with CoHost was a joy. Jewell and Marcus are the best! Their team is super professional and made planning our wedding a breeze. Their food vendors are all top notch and their rental items are all good quality. They were very communicative and flexible working with our venue to make sure everything ran smoothly and we couldn't have been happier with the result. They also went the extra mile to make sure the presentation of the food was beautiful and setup and strike ran smoothly and their staff did an amazing job servicing our buffet tables and packaging up food for us afterwards.

Cohost made it easy!

We loved using Cohost because they allow you access to so many restaurants and catering companies. If you’re looking for multiple food/drink options and want to only work with one vendor, then Cohost is for you.  
  
The only opportunity we noticed was that the service staff at our reception were clearing tables early and too quickly. We had several guests say that they took their plate before they were finished eating or cleared drinks early. We appreciate their attention to details but suggest allowing guests longer to eat and socialize before clearing tables.
