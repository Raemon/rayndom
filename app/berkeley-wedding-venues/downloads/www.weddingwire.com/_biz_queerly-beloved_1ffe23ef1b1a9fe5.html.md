Definitely go with Weddings by Adam!

Adam was the officiant for my civil wedding ceremony and they did an amazing job. My now-husband and I wanted to get married quickly after getting our marriage license and Adam was not only flexible enough to accommodate our timing but they put together a very thoughtful and special ceremony. Adam brings a lot of love, joy, and humor to every wedding they do and they are also very thorough to make sure they cater the ceremony to the couple's vision. I couldn't recommend them more!

Allison & Casey's Wedding

My husband has known Adam for many years and when it came time to plan the ceremony portion of our wedding, there was only one person we could imagine marrying us. Adam is professional, sincere, and witty, and the ceremony they crafted was all of those things and more. They take the time to get to know you both as individuals and as a couple, weaving beautiful and heartfelt details of both into the ceremony. It’s been almost a year since our wedding, and my mom still talks about how much she loved Adam’s ceremony! Would absolutely recommend Adam as an officiant 1,000 times over.
