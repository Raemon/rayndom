Most Beautiful Place On Earth

It’s 52 days later and we (and our guests) are still absolutely gushing over our outdoor, tented reception in the Renaissance Rose Court location at the Norfolk Botanical Gardens; it was the perfect venue for our wedding! Between their phenomenal staff and stunning views, they had it all! We could not have asked for better! They truly make you feel like VIPs throughout the entire process, from beginning to end.  
During our initial tour of the venue, the NBG team emphasized that they were always happy to answer any email or call that we sent their way (and boy did they mean it), so we knew we were in good hands the day of the wedding! Their level of communication is impeccable and I promise you will be left feeling like they will do anything to help you achieve your perfect wedding day! The NBG team are not only masters in problem solving, but they are also true professionals. They maintained a friendly and approachable demeanor, and helped all our vendors work together to make every small detail look perfect. The NBG team provided many different ideas and suggestions to make sure we could bring our vision to life in the best and most efficient way possible. They asked an abundance of great questions throughout the process to get a feel for what were our absolute “must haves” and even suggested some things we hadn’t thought of.  
We hosted our ceremony on the brick in front of the fountain at the Renaissance Rose Court location, cocktail hour at the Statuary Vista location, and then the reception was under a dreamy twinkle light tent on the first grassy tier at the Renaissance Rose Court location. Guests were in awe of the view (and we also lucked out with absolutely perfect, albeit slightly hot, weather)! They were also true champions (and professionals) to help our other vendors set up and break down through our outdoor wedding, on July 12th, in Virginia!  
Working with the staff at the Norfolk Botanical Garden has been an absolute pleasure from first contact until the end of the wedding day (and the next day when we stopped by to pick up a few forgotten items). Their exceptional talent, professionalism, and dedication to their craft makes them a stand out choice in the world of wedding venues! We could not recommend the Norfolk Botanical Gardens enough, and can’t wait to return to celebrate future life moments! It’s definitely well-worth the investment for a beautiful, love-filled weekend! - The Canavoses

Something Special 

The best place to get married. When I say I’m so happy that we picked the garden to get married. We picked the butterfly garden and it was beautiful. The staff were very helpful, friendly and compassionate. They made sure everything was right and perfect. The staff go over and beyond to make sure that your special days go as smooth as possible. I definitely recommend.

This venue is beautiful!

We contracted Norfolk Botanical Garden for our wedding venue (Cherry Blossom Package). All of the wedding staff were extremely accommodating and helpful. They provided chairs for the ceremony in the Perennial Garden as well as tables and chairs for the dinner in the Rotunda at no additional cost. I highly recommend the Norfolk Botanical Garden for your event!

Absolutely beautiful & incredible! 

My husband and I have been longtime members of the Garden, so when it was time for us to choose a venue there wasn’t a doubt in our mind where we would want to get married. I emailed the weddings department and within minutes I had a response answering all my questions and to schedule a venue tour. We were greeted by the lovely Giada and she gave us a wonderful tour of our options of where the ceremony could take place, as well as more to know about the English Lavender package we chose! Lena was so helpful and kind during our final detail appointment, even giving us a special ride on the golf cart to the ceremony site and we were so appreciative! Wedding day, the moment I stepped out of the car I was greeted by Chloe on a golf, she was so prepared and had me hidden in the trees within minutes!! All of the ladies I spoke with were absolutely incredible in every single email, and even more so the day of. I am so happy we chose NBG, now we can go back to visit our ceremony site whenever we would like. Thank you SO much to Lena, Chloe and Giada and any of you special ladies I didn’t mention by name.

September 30, 2023 Wedding at NBG

Our wedding at the Norfolk Botanical Garden was an absolute dream come true and it's all thanks to this breathtaking venue at the Butterfly Garden and Baker Hall. This is where my then fiancé and now husband proposed. Proposal happened during a Christmas Light display at NBG. We decided we had to have our wedding there. We were captivated by the natural beauty that surrounded us. And our guests were able to visit the butterfly house.   
  
The Norfolk Botanical Garden served as the perfect backdrop for our special day. The meticulously manicured gardens, vibrant blooms created a picturesque setting that felt like something out of a fairy tale. Our guests were in awe of the atmosphere, and we were constantly showered with compliments about the venue.  
  
What truly sets this venue apart, though, is the impeccable service and attention to detail. The staff at the Norfolk Botanical Garden went above and beyond to make sure our wedding day went off without a hitch. They were accommodating, responsive, and incredibly helpful throughout the planning process, ensuring that every aspect of our celebration was flawless.  
  
The versatility of this venue is also worth noting. They offer a variety of stunning locations within the garden to suit your style and guest list.  
  
Our wedding day at the Norfolk Botanical Garden was a day filled with beauty, love, and cherished memories. If you're looking for a venue that combines natural splendor with exceptional service, I wholeheartedly recommend this hidden gem. Our hearts are forever grateful to the Norfolk Botanical Garden for making our wedding day truly remarkable.

Quality and Beautiful

Our wedding day was a beautiful experience at Baker’s Overlook in NBG. The package included the opportunity to take photos within many areas of the garden and our wedding host for the day ensured everything went smoothly.

Absolutely Beautiful Venue

Getting married in March I figured there wasn't going to be a lot of flowers. Boy was I wrong! Every where you go you'll find something beautiful to see. The coordinator was wonderful and fun! They treat you like family and they prepared for everything! They made my day so simple and I can't thank them enough!

Perfect venue for a beautiful garden ceremony and indoor reception

If you are looking for the best place to host your event in Norfolk, you found it! I am a professional DJ and I work a few wedding events here every year and already have some lined up for next year. Before this year is over, I wanted to take the time and share with all review readers how grateful I am for the opportunity to be able to collaborate with such a great venue and the talented team that makes magic happen every time I am there. You have plenty of options for an outdoor ceremony and indoor reception. They communicate well with vendors, everything is always clean and looks amazing, and the layout options are awesome. They surely go above and beyond for their clients to have the best time ever. Go see for yourself, book your event here!
