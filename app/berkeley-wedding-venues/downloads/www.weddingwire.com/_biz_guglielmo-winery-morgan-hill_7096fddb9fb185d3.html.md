Wonderful outdoor venue with a fantastic event coordinator!

I got married at Guglielmo Winery in Sept 2024 and had an absolutely amazing and unforgettable experience. I am so happy with our choice of this venue.   
  
Starting with the initial tour of the venue, the Event Director, Brianna, was incredibly sincere, friendly, and knowledgeable. We met with her a few times over the course of our wedding planning process, and she was so communicative and on top of things throughout the whole process.  
  
After planning a wedding, the best advice I can give to an engaged couple is to find vendors who are good communicators. There are vendors who will be slow to respond or not respond at all in the wedding planning process without multiple reminder emails, and it can add so much unneeded stress. From setting up the initial tour of the venue to our check-in meeting to our ceremony rehearsal two days before the event, I can’t say enough about how good Brianna was with her communication with us.  
  
Convenience for guests was an important factor for us, and the venue is easily accessible from the freeway and has easy parking across the street in a large high school parking lot. No winding roads or lost guests! And it has the ceremony area, cocktail hour, reception, and dance floor all in close proximity to one another.  
  
The lighting at night is absolutely beautiful with the string lights under a large canopy tent. And it felt so spacious and comfortable for our 160-person wedding.   
  
There are pricing packages to fit any number of guests, whether it be for a small intimate wedding for 50 guests or a large 300-person wedding. If you’re looking for an outdoor wedding venue, Guglielmo Winery is the place for you!

Beautiful winery and wonderful people! 

We absolutely LOVED having our wedding here. The winery itself is beautiful, romantic, and rustic. The staff were incredibly friendly, personable, and so easy to work with. We 100% recommend Guglielmo to all future bride and grooms as the ideal venue, both for the excellent customer service, gorgeous pictures, and sweet memories!

July Wedding

We had a wonderful time working with Brianna to get everything set for our all-inclusive wedding package in July. She was very responsive and answered all of my questions. She also was very detailed and organized the day of that I didn’t even have to set up or clean up any of the additional decor we brought in! Everything was very very handled and I would recommend booking your wedding here!

Amazing staff

This review is not only for the amazing staff at Guglielmos, it’s also for Brianna our wonderful coordinator. Let me start by saying that having a wedding is very stressful but what makes it a pleasant experience are the staff. On the day of my wedding there was a fire at one of the near streets and the electricity for the entire street went out. They all did such an amazing job to keep me from stressing and everything was so smooth with no problems. Guglielmo winery is beautiful. Looking at my pictures, the background and the flowers really added to the beauty. I really appreciate Brianna for everything she did from start to finish. Whether it was the great communication or planning everything, I couldn’t have asked for a better team of people and venue. Thank you all so much.

Best Day of Our Lives

We had our wedding and rehearsal dinner at Guglielmo Winery and could not have chosen a better venue. The staff were accommodating and professional and adapted to our needs without adding any stress. This allowed us to have the best day of our lives! The food from Fire4Hire was delicious and the wine from Guglielmo was equally delicious. We highly recommend this venue for your future wedding.

Dreamiest Wedding

My husband and I got married at Guglielmo in June of 2023. It was a dream come true and we are still having guests tell us that it was one of their favorite weddings and that the venue was beautiful. Guglielmo has two options if you use them as a venue, an all-inclusive option and then a more DIY option. We chose the DIY option and they were SO flexible and helpful as we planned our dream wedding. They even let us bring in a huge flower wall that my dad built for our wedding. Most venues try to charge you for every little thing but Guglielmo was reasonable and didn't seem to abuse their ability to make money off of us. They were fair and kind. Not only were they a pleasure to work with but it is a beautiful location. There are so many picture perfect sites around the winery. We also got lots of compliments on their wine and the frozen Rose was a hit! I would highly recommend Guglielmo to anyone wanting to add their own touches to their wedding while still having a venue that comes with a lot of things (chairs, tables, flipping crew, etc.).

Summer Wedding 6.28.24

We held our wedding reception here at Guglielmo Winery and everything turned out amazing! It was everything we could’ve imagined for our wedding day. Brianna was so helpful and so attentive with being our coordinator for the day, everything ran so smoothly. Also, Fire 4 Hire catering was amazing! The appetizers were to die for and all the food was delicious. Definitely recommend Guglielmo winery 10/10.

Do it for the Wine Slushies! 

Going from stressing about picking the right venue to living out the most ideal wedding experience at a beautiful location seems like something you could only dream of, but Brianna and the staff at Guglielmo Winery made it a reality! Every step of the process was as smooth and personalized as we could have ever hoped for. We went with the 100 person all-in-one package and it was easily the best choice we made during the entire planning process. All of the vendors picked from this package provided incredible service from our first introductions to the day of service. Not to mention they are all very experienced with the venue's location and staff which another layer of peace of mind when it comes to coordination throughout the planning process.   
  
Detailing out every single way our wedding day was made special by the team at Guglielmo would take days! But know this, they really do care about your needs as a couple and will do everything in their power to make it happen. We could not be happier with our experience here and will gladly be recommending this venue for years to come!

Best decision we made!

We can't express enough how thankful we are for Brianna Merritt and her team at Guglielmo Winery! She went over and above the call of duty to make our day perfect! She was easy to work with and gave us all the time we needed to plan all the details. She helped us create the vision for the day and walked us through all the details of the planning with such ease. We are so happy with the outcome of our Special Day and couldn't be more excited to see all the pictures of our wedding at this amazing venue! Thank you, Brianna, for all your hard work and thank you to the Guglielmo Family for allowing us to create our dream wedding day at your family winery. All our Love, Brooke & Emil 2-24-24

I have photographed numerous times at Guglielmo Winery over the years. Nestled just south of San Jose this winery gives you a traditional wine country atmosphere. As a professional photographer I can appreciate the flexibility and the numerous locations on the grounds where I can photograph my couples. Also the staff is very professional to its clients and other vendors.
