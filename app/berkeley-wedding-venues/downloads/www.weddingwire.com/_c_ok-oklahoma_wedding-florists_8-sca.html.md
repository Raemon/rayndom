I enjoyed working with Abundant Flowers. I just sent a couple pictures of what I had in mind for flowers and they put together perfect arrangements. The only down-side was that they do not deliver and require pickup.

Im not going to lie I was a little hesitant about using real flowers for my wedding. I thought I would save money using silk flowers. But then I met with Cole and she 100% made me change my mind. She knows SO much about flowers and wedding florals, I just knew I would be in good hands. Cole took care of everything for me. She got to the venue and set up all the flowers while I was getting ready. If I had done fake flowers I wouldve been worried about tasking someone to set up. If youre considering booking with Cole- do it! Shes a genius with flowers. I didnt really know what I wanted so I told her to do whatever she thinks is best and she DID. It was beautiful, and yet didnt break the bank lol!

I planned and organized our small wedding quickly and when it came to CB floral design they were my saving grace regarding ideas and design direction. I had a vague idea of a theme and CB provided great input and ultimately provided not only beautiful flowers for our bouquets but also for our tables and site for our vows. Monica communicated with me as needed and was a pleasure to work with. I highly recommend CB floral design for your event!

I am so happy I chose Broadway for my big day! Scherry was more than accommodating and brought my ideas to life! She was more than happy to look at my ideas and pictures and discuss all the other details of our wedding so that the flowers would be perfect. She was extremely professional while also adding a personal touch. She made an effort to get to know both me and my husband which was so great. The flowers were stunning! She took such great care of them and even called when they came in to let me know how she would care for them until they were delivered to the venue. It was so special to have someone that cared and made it easy not to stress!

I was very pleased with Petal Pushers. Not only were the flowers almost exactly what I wanted, but the florist herself delivered them (not a delivery boy). She stuck around until she was sure I was satisfied with everything - even making a last minute adjustment to my bouquet when I commented that the stems were longer than I had hoped for. Very flexible, and very easy to work with. 5 stars all around!

Ladybug was great and did exactly what I wanted. She even came to the store early in the morning so that I could pick up the flowers before I headed out to the venue. They where great, and even fixed anything that I didn't like (which wasn't much, they did a great job). She even helped me load it into the backseat of my car. I would recommend them to anyone :)

It's been a family tradition to have floral arrangements from Betty Lou's for weddings. It began with my mom's wedding, then my sister's and now mine. She provides wonderful arrangements that turn out beautifully! I told her I wanted a somewhat wildflower look and she was able to help make the perfect bouquet. In fact, the bouquet was so pretty I asked my husband if I could take it on the honeymoon with us!

We ordered the flowers for our wedding from OK Flower Market and I’m so glad we did! We were able to get so many flowers at such a great price! Ronna was so kind and worked with me on which flowers to get. She even called repeatedly till she got a hold of me when a flower I ordered wasn’t available, and helped me decide on another color that would compliment our other blooms. Then they had everything packed up and ready when we arrived to pick them up. If you want beautiful flowers, but have a budget the Flower Market is the way to go!!!
