We can't say enough wonderful things about Jodie and the incredible job she and Savanna did coordinating our wedding! From the very beginning, she was organized, attentive, and genuinely cared about making our day perfect. She kept every detail on track — communicating with vendors, managing timelines, and checked in with me throughout the planning process. Thanks to Jodie, we were able to truly relax and be present on our wedding day knowing everything was in great hands. The day flowed seamlessly, and our guests kept commenting on how smooth and stress-free everything felt. If you're looking for someone who's professional, kind, and truly goes above and beyond to make your vision come to life, we wholeheartedly recommend Jodie and her team! They made our wedding day absolutely unforgettable.

Honestly, absolutely everything provided exceeded our hopes and expectations. The entire process of planning was so easy – made seamless by Natasha, our wedding coordinator and decorator (who is also hard-working and very sweet). Natasha made every effort to accommodate us in every way to make it the most special day in April for us in Jamaica!! What I truly appreciate about Natasha is her professionalism, dedication, and communication throughout the entire process. Thank you so much, Natasha! You are the best! Marquita

Navette’s expertise is out of this world! I’m so lucky I found her to plan my wedding. She’s very organized and detail oriented. She listened to all my needs and tailored her approach so it didn’t overwhelm me as there were several things I wasn’t even thinking of when planning my big day. Her communication style was on point and I never had to worry as I trusted her completely and knew she’d make it an unforgettable wedding. I would 100% recommend Navette to any future brides out there!

Ally and Jourdan were monumental in helping plan and run our wedding. On the day of our wedding, I didn't have to worry about anything. Ally and Jourdan were on top of everything. They even helped with things I never thought to ask of them. When we went to read our vows, our vow books were just handed to us. When I was getting my hair done, Ally handed my family heirloom hair pins to my makeup artists.. all things I totally forgot about in the moment but they had my back! They were such a pleasure and joy to work with and help plan our wedding. They managed different personalities with kindness and grace and did everything we asked of them with a smile on their face! We are so happy we found Ally and Jourdan and feel like we broke up with our best friends now that the wedding is over!

Finding my dress was a great experience. The sales person was very attentive and was full of energy, which made it fun and less stressful. All of the staff was very nice, and helpful. I wasn't sure I was going to find what I wanted, but I ended up finding an amazing dress for a lot less than I expected to pay.
