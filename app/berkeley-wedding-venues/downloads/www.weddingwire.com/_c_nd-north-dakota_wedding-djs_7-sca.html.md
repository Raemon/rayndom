Tyler was the DJ for our wedding and reception. He met with us prior to the wedding to get a feel for our musical tastes and really helped bring the party to our New Year’s wedding! He met all of our goofy requests and made sure that we were having a great time by checking in with us throughout the ceremony. We had a fantastic wedding and reception thanks to him! We also utilized the Powerplay karaoke package at our wedding and it took our party to an extra level of fun! I highly recommend Powerplay DJ!

We cannot say enough great things about Dance Man Dance! He was absolutely amazing at our wedding. Professional, personable, and SO much fun. He made everything seamless from start to finish and kept the dance floor packed all night long! This is actually the second time our family has had him for a wedding, and we’d recommend him to anyone looking for an incredible DJ who truly knows how to create the perfect atmosphere. We already can’t wait to work with him again! We can't thank you enough for everything, Dan!!!

Scott was our DJ for our wedding. He was so easy to work with and had lots for ideas and suggestions for us. He went above and beyond to make sure everything was just right. We had several guests that complemented us on our DJ. He played a wide variety of music and just knew what to play to keep everyone dancing. I would recommend them 100%.

Working with pike presents was amazing from start to finish. He was responsive, friendly, patient and so helpful! The day of our wedding, he was all that and more! He came prepared, organized and upbeat. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience! Plus the photo booth was such a fun addition and our guests loved it. We’re still hearing how great the music was and how fun the photo booth was a whole month after our wedding! :)

Brenna was our DJ and she was simply amazing. She was down for any and all of our ideas, and was super pivotal in making our day one to remember. Throughout the evening, my husband and I kept getting feedback on how fun our wedding was and how it was the best wedding they had been to. We definitely owe that to Brenna and her sister! Thank you thank you thank you for making our day the BEST DAY EVER!!!!!

At first we were a bit hesitant to hire K Hook as our DJ due to our budget. They were a bit over our price range but decided to book them anyways after our consult with the owner. He reassured us in our meeting that he could make our day one to remember and his company did just that. We received so many compliments on our first dance as we added on the dancing on the cloud. Our pictures were also amazing due to that add on. This company is worth rearranging your budget for.

Austin set up without any worry, signage was appropriate for what I wanted and was looking for, and one of my friends made it their priority to fill that book with pictures as much as possible. The design of the pictures was amazing, and I've had guests ask about the photobooth after the fact too!

Such a phenomenal experience. Scott was incredibly flexible and worked with us really well with last minute wedding information. He was patient, and a true professional that made our wedding special. You won't have any regrets.

He was so easy and fun to work with, is very knowledgeable about what he does, and was very helpful and full of ideas! He helped with everything from the ceremony, cocktail hour, reception, announcements, and took tons of great pictures! We received so many compliments from our guests about how fun and interactive he was, and everyone there had a great time!
