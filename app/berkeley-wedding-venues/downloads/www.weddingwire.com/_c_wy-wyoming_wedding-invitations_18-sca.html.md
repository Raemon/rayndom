I found Erica Hammer on Etsy and was lucky enough to one of the few brides that was able to hire her at a special rate to make a custom map. I was married in Puerto Rico and gave a lengthy (I wondered if too lengthy) list of place I wanted shown on the map. She sent numerous drafts requesting feedback and allowing plenty of opportunity to make changes. In the end it was pure art. I even had it blown up and transferred to a canvas to display at the rehearsal dinner (and now my home). I also used the map as the cover to a booklet given to all the guests describing places they could consider visiting on the island. It was beautiful and the guests loved it. I HIGHLY recommend her services. She will spend many hours on your map and it is truly custom art when it is complete.

I ordered some chalkboards from Chalk Art by Britt and they are being shipped today! I am so excited! Brittney worked with my budget to create a custom logo and boards for the day of the wedding. Her boards are permanized (bring on the weather) and absolutely beautiful.
