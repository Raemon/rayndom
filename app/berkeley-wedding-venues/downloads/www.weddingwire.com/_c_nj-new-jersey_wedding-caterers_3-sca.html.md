The Catering Station totally nailed it! The food was SO good—like, the kind you keep thinking about even after the event is over. Their seafood is so fresh and there is more than enough for everyone to enjoy! Plus, Jose and Desiree are amazing and were great to work with. They are super friendly and on top of everything, which made the whole process easy and stress-free. If you’re on the fence, just book them—you won’t regret it!

Thank you to the entire Sukhadia team for being truly exceptional. The food was incredible—every dish, every station, every detail was perfect. We appreciate how flexible and supportive you were with last-minute needs and small adjustments along the way. Shaivi, it was an honor working with you. Your professionalism, warmth, and dedication made this experience so easy and so enjoyable for us. We already know people will be talking about the food long after the wedding. Thank you for making the culinary side of our celebration unforgettable.

My experience working with Foodwerx, and specifically Roxanne, couldn’t have gone any more smoother. The company and her were responsive, efficient, professional, kind, and personable. They went above and beyond to consistently reach out and make sure I understood the process of this aspect of wedding planning, and their role and piece in this aspect. Foodwerx was so helpful and their food and service was complimented by MANY of my guests. I couldn’t be more pleased that Roxanne and Foodwerx were a part of my special day.

Ultimate Caterer catered my 2/22/25 wedding recently and I cannot say enough positive things about our experience working with them. I originally met Alan back in 2021 at the Art Factory and he was extremely friendly, helpful and was one of their house caterers. To make a very long and complicated story short, we had to delay our wedding over 2 years and change venues and Alan & staff were so understanding and flexible with us. When we nailed down our new date and location, we worked closely with Heidi on our menu, day of plans and all the little details that come with planning a wedding. I am so grateful to have hired such an amazing company for our big day. The food was amazing - we had a vegetarian and vegan only menu with 5 international food stations and everyone commented on how excellent the food was. Not only was it delicious and to our specifications but the variety and amount of food that was served was generous. The staff was friendly, fast and did an amazing job setting up and cleaning up within our allotted event time frame. They were also able to recommend other fantastic vendors. Needless to say, I highly recommend them for your event!

Brennan's was the perfect choice for our wedding. After checking out a few catering halls, we hadn't found any place that had food that wow-ed us. We were a little apprehensive walking into the deli, but were quickly impressed by the food and by Brian and the staff. Our guests were stuffed by cocktail hour and have been raving about the food ever since. We didn't have much of a chance to eat during our wedding, but the event staff packed up meals for us to enjoy after our reception which was delicious. Brian is easy to work with and we couldn't be happier with our choice of Brennan's.

Michael’s Event Catering exceeded every expectation & more; I cannot say enough amazing things about our experience as it was flawless from start to finish!! We hired them for an outdoor birthday party this past weekend, and they absolutely knocked it out of the park. We went with their BBQ package and appreciated how easy it was to customize. Adding a Philly cheesesteak station turned out to be one of the best decisions, as it was a huge hit with our guests! We also added their dessert and beverage stations that were gorgeous and fully stocked, down to the napkins and ice = one less thing to worry about during a busy day! Paul was so wonderful with communication leading up to the event, always quick to respond and super organized. On the day of, Michael, Chrissy, and their whole team showed up with high energy, professionalism, and a seamless system for setup and breakdown. Our guests could not stop talking about the food!!! All day and all night, and for days to come! The flavor, the quality, the presentation... it was all amazing. The dessert display looked straight out of a magazine, even the condiments were beautifully presented!! We’d work with Michael’s again in a heartbeat and can’t recommend them enough to anyone planning a wedding or special event. Truly top-notch service and food. Thank you so much for making our event so unforgettable!

Cheryl is AMAZING! I wish we could give her 10 stars. Her professionalism, ease to work with, reliable and provided a good choice of foods for our wedding! We couldn't have picked a better caterer. In addition to her catering services, she assisted us in getting linens and chairs, and set-up for our evening. Her crew is also amazing and were a big help during our entire evening. Cheryl made sure we had something to eat during our cocktail hour and served our meal during dinner, which included gluten-free options. If you want someone who is great at what they do and can adjust the menu to what you like to eat; pick Church Street Catering. We would choose Cheryl and her company all over again if we needed to do so.

We recently got married this month and T&L Catering was incredible! From the moment we stepped into the hall in Linden, NJ, we met Jaci who walked us through what hosting a reception in their space would look like. Jaci was patient, so kind, and extremely accommodating. Pam was also so helpful with helping us stay organized and gathering our menu details and headcount. Although our wedding was two weeks ago, our family and friends cannot stop raving about the food at the hall and the vibes from the staff who were stellar. Don’t hesitate to hire T&L Catering for your next event!

I had the pleasure of going to a wedding that hired Frungillo. They were over the top with their service. the wedding was well over 250 people I had mentioned once that I had a dietary restriction and Angelina had remembered this all throughout the night. I had the pleasure of speaking with Tracey Maire d' and she was awesome. The food was incredible from the hors d'oeuvres to the main course. 10/10
