Our experience with The Barns at Wesleyan Hills was absolutely outstanding. From the beginning, the entire wedding team went above and beyond to make our day seamless and stress-free. Their professionalism, attention to detail, and genuine care made all the difference throughout the planning process and on the big day itself. The food was exceptional—beautifully presented, full of flavor, and something our guests are still talking about. Everyone was attentive and kind, ensuring everything ran smoothly and that we could fully enjoy each moment. We’re so grateful to the entire team at The Barns at Wesleyan Hills for creating such a memorable and flawless wedding experience. We truly couldn’t have imagined a better place to celebrate our day.

My husband and I got married at Wrights Mill on 8/31/25! Absolutely no words! FIVE STARS! It was absolutely surreal to be on the receiving end of what we all like to call a well oiled machine! I got to experience what everyone always raves about! It was absolutely magical! To some Wrights may just be a building/place but to ME Wrights is my home! It’s not just four walls it’s the people inside of it that I treasure the most! They aren’t my FARMILY they are my FAMILY! 🩷 TO CURT, BRIE, CJ, CHERYL, KRISSY, SUE, KANEESHA, NYPHA, DEB, MISSY, MARK, PAT, BIAGIO, DOM, TYLER I CANT THANK YOU ALL ENOUGH FOR WORKING AND MAKING EVERYTHING ABSOLUTELY PERFECT .. from set up to the amazing food, cocktails and music; all of our guests cannot stop raving about the day! From the bottom of our hearts thank you all so much! And if you’re not sure about renting the house I highly recommend you do!

We recently held my daughter's Bridal Shower at The Gardens at Hidden Lake and cannot say enough good things about it!! The venue & gardens are absolutely stunning!! We had seating inside and outside. The garden's are beautiful - walkways, seating & fountains throughout. And they are still expanding the gardens. The staff was an extreme pleasure to work with & were very accommodating! Dishes, silverware, platters, cake stands, mini lamps, table runners, etc.. are there for you to use. Highly recommend!!

The CT wedding group were amazing from the first day we met them at the Pavilion on Crystal Lake to the big day. They helped with every small detail, and made the wedding planning process fun and as stress free as possible. The Pavilion on Crystal Lake is a beautiful venue, from the lake, ceremony location outdoor and great indoor space. We had to move our ceremony indoors and the team made it beautiful and exceeded my expectations. The food is amazing from cocktail hour all the way to dessert. The day of staff was amazing. We had Dimitri and Melissa as our coordinators and they were truly the dream team. Anything we needed they were already two steps ahead. The whole staff were amazing and ready to have a good time with us and our guests. Our family still talks about the staff, the food, and venue a month later. We could not have asked for a better team, venue and wedding day❤️

Winvian was the most magical place for Stephen and I to get married - truly the best weekend of our lives. Couldn't have imagined a better place to say yes to my husband! We are so thankful to the Winvian team for taking care of every detail for us and making our wedding so special!! Ann and Erin were rockstars throughout the planning process, and they made sure to tie off on every detail. The food and drinks were fantastic, and the flow of the outdoor garden wedding to the Gordon Brown house for the reception, to the bar for the afterparty, was just perfect. Thank you Winvian team!

This venue will blow your guests away! Falls Creek Farm is truly one of a kind, from the moment you arrive, you’re surrounded by breathtaking scenery and warm hospitality. Every detail has been thoughtfully designed, creating such an amazing experience. The houses and the farm are absolutely beautiful with horses grazing in the pastures, waterfront views and charming touches in the bridal suite and lodging.

My fiancé and I decide to elope with just our children and this was the perfect venue. I also attended a much larger wedding here that was beautiful as well!!!! The owners and manager are amazing. They respond extremely fast and actually want to get to know you and your partner! They were also very accommodating since it decided to rain day of, and two days leading up to our elopement. The grounds are beautiful and there are so many great places for picture opportunities. I highly recommend this venue to anyone. We looked at dozens and this was a perfect fit for us for so many reasons, especially pricing!!

Having our wedding at Smith Farm Gardens was a dream come true. The grounds are beautifully kept, the home is picture-perfect, and Travis and his mother Peggy are the most gracious hosts you can ask for. Choosing a family run business was the best decision we could have made for our wedding venue. When we visited Smith Farm Gardens, we met with Peggy and Travis directly. The feeling we got from them was infinitely more warm and inviting than the other venues we saw, and this was directly reflected in the 18 months leading up to our big day. They were so easy to get in touch with, so accommodating of our vendors, and always supportive of our vision for the day. Travis and Peggy were also very involved and helpful with making sure everything went to plan the day of. There happened to be some strong winds the morning of our wedding, and it was posing a problem for the altar we had set up in the orchard. Even though he was juggling a million other things, Travis took time to personally handle the situation, taking an enormous weight off our shoulders by keeping our altar in one piece and firmly on the ground! We cannot recommend Smith Farm Gardens enough. Travis and Peggy treated us like family, and it’s clear to see that they take pride in their home and the work that they do.

My husband and I just got married at The Overlook a month ago, and we couldn’t have asked for a more perfect day! The venue was beyond anything we could have asked for! The view and the grounds were breathtaking! Bo and all of the staff there were very helpful and friendly. We were able to bring things up (decorations, table settings, etc.) the night before which was very helpful. The tent was beyond large enough to accommodate al of guests. This venue is perfect in every way! If you are looking for a beautiful outdoor venue, I would highly recommend The Overlook to anyone who asks!!
