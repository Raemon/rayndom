My husband and I had our wedding this past October at Poppy Ridge and it was an amazing experience! Abby and Tiffani were both extremely helpful and communicative. Tiffani went above and beyond on the day of to make sure everything ran smoothly and made us feel extremely supported. The venue is absolutely stunning at this time of year, our guests had an amazing time and the food was delicious! The amount we spent was well worth it and reasonable. We can’t wait to play some rounds of golf and grab a bite of the delicious food again. Please don’t hesitate to call or tour this place for your special day!
