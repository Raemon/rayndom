Best Wedding DJ & Host

Steve is a great DJ and host! He was the DJ for our wedding - everything ran so smoothly throughout our day. Steve arrived early to set up all the sound for the event (ceremony/cocktail hour/reception). He did a great job putting up equipment in a way that was discreet. Steve's process and guidance through planning the event made it so easy. Steve was great in facilitating all the different events throughout the night and providing guidance to our guests in a way that was seamless. Our guests even said how much they appreciated how he handled everything and how smooth everything was.   
One of my favorite moments that I didn’t expect was the anniversary dance. I dont think I had seen that at other weddings I had been to, but during planning Steve asked if we were interested and we decided to do it. Dancing with my husband and seeing different friends and family come join us as their years were called was such a heartwarming and incredible experience.

"How amazing was that DJ?!"

Heard it easily 75 times over the days following our wedding, nobody could believe how natural Steve was interacting with us and our guests. He had great suggestions for the flow of the evening and was incredibly personable. Your guests will thank you for going with Steve!!

Cody and Monica’s wedding 

Hiring Steve for our wedding was an absolutely perfect choice. During the planning phase he was prompt, professional, and friendly at all times. He listened to our music requests and diligently worked to create the perfect playlist for our wedding. Sound during the ceremony and reception were perfect. He was very flexible and was able to change the music based on what the crowd wanted. People were dancing the whole time during our reception! I had never seen that before at a wedding. He made it perfectly clear that he would make no changes or requests outside of our genres/playlists of music without our permission. His flexibility and professionalism made the night memorable. Steve also hosted the reception beautifully and walked to each table to personally release guests to get food from our catering buffet. Doing that instead of announcing tables over a PA system set a tone of professionalism, courtesy, and class that is unmatched by any other DJ I’ve seen. Many of our guests commented on how great the music was and how Steve made them feel like they were part of a high class night out on the town. Hiring Steve is the right choice and will be one of the best decisions you make for your wedding.

Steve hit the mark on everything we were looking for!

Music and the was our wedding was hosted was super important to my husband and to me. We interviewed a number of DJs and when we found Steve we knew he was the right one to work with. Steve has an incredible professionalism and considerate nature that goes into his work. He did an incredible job painting the vision of exactly how the day would go in terms of the music/audio during ceremony, transitioning into cocktail hour, and the reception and all of the speeches and special events. He made it clear that we wouldn't have to worry about and "cheesy" DJ announcements and he explained that he doesn't speak on the mic whenever he can so that it doesn't distract from the evening. And instead, he goes above and beyond to walk around personally to tables to act as a host and let people know where to find guest favors, the dessert table, etc. That was such a HUGE plus for us knowing that there was a very professional and friendly person overseeing the night! The process of sending him the songs we wanted for Ceremony, Cocktail, and Reception was really cool because of the technology he uses which is easy. He also offers some really good ideas in terms of which music to choose but also allows you to completely pick what you prefer. When deciding how to handle emotional reception events such as dances, he was sensitive to how we wanted to lead into those based on unique situations with our families. I can honestly say Steve was one of my favorite, if not most favorite, vendor to work with because of how straight-forward and helpful he was in guiding us through the wedding planning experience from this perspective. Steve also has a unique way of ensuring mics during ceremony are hidden and is very dependable when it comes to solid audio/volume, etc. We couldn't be more happy with how Steve added to our most special day! Thank you so much, Steve!!! ~Monica and John

Steve is a total professional and I felt 100% comfortable with him as the captain of our wedding ship. The dance floor was floor literally the entire night. (Everyone writes that in their reviews, but I honestly never saw the bar during my wedding because I NEVER STOPPED DANCING). Ceremony and cocktail music set the mood and functioned perfectly, microphones worked perfectly, he transitioned everyone between spaces subtly, and generally led us through the day without missing a beat. Do yourself a favor, and book Steve.

Steve is the best. He is very affordable and also offers lighting and monograms. He is a true entertainer and professional. He is worth every penny. He allows you to chose all the songs and can help you if you get stuck. The uplighting was beautiful and the monogram was as well. I can't say enough good things about him. He makes the wedding planning process so easy and is always available to help. Brides, I would book him while you still have the chance.

I can't say enough good things about Steve. From the moment we met him he was so kind, so professional, and so responsive. He let my husband and I pick our entire music selection for our wedding and if we wanted his help on some he would throw in his ideas and thoughts as well. On our wedding day he was so interactive with the guests and was so professional on the mic. Hands down amazing!

One of my first priorities after getting engaged was finding the perfect DJ that would create the fun atmosphere we were looking for. I found all of that and more in Steve. From the moment we first spoke on the phone, I knew he was the one! He is such a genuine, hardworking man who genuinely cares for the couples he works with. He wealth of experience allowed me to pick his brain for inspiration and he had some amazing ideas! He was so much more than just a DJ to us, he was a Master of the Ceremony. He took care of everything from beginning to end and really allowed us to relax on the big day. I put my trust in Steve and he did not let me down, everyone that attended our wedding loved his attitude. He was instrumental in planning the flow of the wedding, helping to create a song list, and even did our lighting (which turned out to be completely magical). When you book Steve, you will get so much more than a DJ, you will get a wedding mentor and friend! Thank you so much to Steve for making our day exactly what we had dreamed!

One of the top priorities for my husband and I in wedding planning was selecting the right DJ. We knew as soon as we met Steve at Coffee Bean one day that he was our guy! You couldn’t find a nicer, easier going person to play such a big role in your wedding. Steve is very responsive and open to working with you on any of your music selection. His website has a portal to select all the music you want for the different parts of your special day and even includes top playlists for different things (top mother/son dance songs, top first dance songs, etc.). We picked all our own music and let him know what we DIDN’T want played and he’s REALLY good about making sure no song is played off your list unless you’re cool with it (we were big anti YMCA, love shack, chicken dance kind of songs). He’s got a great voiced and presence as master of ceremonies for your wedding which was also invaluable so our guests knew where to go and what was happening each step of the way. And if he felt the dance floor was lightening up he’d select a good groove song next and get people back out. It was truly the best night of my life, we had a blast as did our dancing guests. You rock Steve!!!

Steve (Unique Mobile Sounds) really helped to make our wedding day so special. He is great at feeling the audience and catering to the party to make everything run smoothly and also great at getting people on the dance floor. Thank you Steve for being part of our special day and all the time and energy you put into making it so magical! I highly recommend Unique Mobile Sounds so do not waiver to choose him if you are looking for a DJ for your special event!
