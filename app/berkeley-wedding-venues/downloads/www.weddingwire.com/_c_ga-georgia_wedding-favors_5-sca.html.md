My wedding favors where these custom wedding cake cookes monogrammed with our initals and decorated to look like my actual wedding cake. They are the most delicous cookies you'll ever taste. They were stunning and unique, and everyone commented on how good they tasted the next day. Donna is the owner and she is exceptional. I've actually used her for many other smaller parties before my wedding and will continue to use her for special occasions in the future. She will go out of her way to make sure you are 100% happy...and believe me you will be.

Heavenly Creations!!!! That's one way to describe Aunt Kimmy's creations. I originally met her at the Cobb Galleria annual bridal show and sampled some things that she offered!!! I was so impressed, I couldn't help but brag to my g/f (aka MOH) about these "Key-lime pie" malt balls that she had. They were decadent. So, no surprise to me, my g/f bought them for my bridal shower and bridal luncheon!!! Everyone absolutely loved them!!!! If you want great goodies and an awesome price, choose Aunt Kimmy's creations!!!! You will not be disappointed.

The best customer experience that I've had in the last decade. I cannot state how amazing the folks at Blue Sky have been. Great products, excellent quality and exceptional staff.
