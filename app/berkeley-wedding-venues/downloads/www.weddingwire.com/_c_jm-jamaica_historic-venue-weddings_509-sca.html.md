The entire staff at Rose Hall was amazing! Their recommendations for other vendors such as flowers, music, etc., were all top notch. The food at our wedding was fantastic and the ceremony and reception were executed flawlessly! I can’t say enough about our coordinator Girdeen. She made the planning enjoyable and was very responsive to all of our questions and requests. Thank you to everyone for making our wedding a day we will never forget!

We were so blessed to have found The Gardens by Chic Events! They were very professional, friendly, and responded quickly when we had questions. Chic Events made our day very special and they went above and beyond for us! We couldn’t imagine having our wedding anywhere else except at The Gardens. Our wedding was breathtaking and perfect! I definitely recommend Chic Events to plan your wedding and/or event!
