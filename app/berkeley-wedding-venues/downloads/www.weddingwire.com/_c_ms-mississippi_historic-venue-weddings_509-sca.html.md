I had my wedding at Brandon Hall in Natchez, Mississippi, and I can’t even begin to express how wonderful the experience was. From the moment we arrived, Ms. Gloria, Mr. Mike, and his wife Linda went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and cared for. Planning a wedding from Boston without being able to visit the venue until four months before the big day could’ve been stressful—but not with Brandon Hall. When we did finally visit, Gloria and Mr. Mike gave us a full tour of the property, and we were blown away. The grounds are absolutely stunning, full of charm and history, and the entire estate has a peaceful, timeless beauty that made it the perfect place to celebrate. One of the things I appreciated most was the flexibility and space—we were able to have both our ceremony and reception on the same property, which made everything so seamless. The rooms inside the main house were spacious and elegant, and for those wanting a little more privacy, the cabins on-site were perfect. Our family had a wonderful time staying there. Brandon Hall really is a one-stop shop—almost every part of the decor was customizable, which made it easy to bring our vision to life without stress. And Gloria, Mr. Mike, and Linda were just the kindest people to work with. They treated us like family and made every part of our stay feel warm and special. Gloria even went all out for breakfast, which was such a thoughtful and generous touch. There’s something truly serene about Brandon Hall. Having the whole place to ourselves before and after the ceremony allowed us to slow down and enjoy the moment. It felt like a retreat in the best way possible. I can’t recommend this venue enough—it’s not just beautiful, it’s full of heart.

I absolutely love the Linden and their services they provided on our wedding day! My husband fell in love with the house and that’s when I knew we were making the right choice on the venue. Mrs. Dorothy, Abagail, and their whole team were amazing. And Mrs. Feltus was an absolute delight - I encourage everyone to meet her at least once! Our October wedding could not have been more perfect.

I wanted an intimate wedding, complete with beautifully lit trees and simple greenery. What I got was more than magical! The lighting was warm and welcoming. The old charm of the building was the cherry on top! The owners created a Pinterest-worthy wedding that went beyond what I had envisioned. The planning process was smooth. This was truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I have no complaints. I highly recommend this vendor!
