I worked for Stein Garden's and Gifts for 10 years. In the design area where artificial flower arraignments are made. I asked my friend if she would do my flowers for my wedding. She was great!! She had an eye for color. I knew I wanted red roses and pink and white flowers. She did an AWESOME job on my flowers!!! They looked sooo real. She also did the coursages and boutineirs for the guys. Its was done on time and the service was outstanding!! Now I have my bouquets forever and they won't die!

Rock, Cheese, and Honey was the company I used to order my wedding favors. I had a simple wedding on a lake and wanted a favor that would be used by my guests. I ordered small bottles of honey and wooden honey dippers from R,C&H and I was very happy with the order. The honey came quickly and was packed carefully as the jars were glass. The prices were reasonable and it was popular with my guests.

Gail, Katharine, and the entire team at Gail Ambrosius were fantastic to work with in planning for my wedding day dessert.

Josie was amazing to work with. We did all our communication via phone and email since we were ordering from Ohio and she is in Wisconsin, but it went very smoothly. We chose the prairie seed boxes (which when planted grow wildflowers) that contained 2 vegan chocolate truffles and we LOVED them. Many of our guests commented on how different of a favor it was and seemed excited to go home and plant the boxes. The favors arrived the week of the reception to assure the chocolates were fresh and they stood up to the heat very well (it was a week of temperatures in the high 80s). The pricing was very reasonable and included a printed tag attached to the box with raffia that we chose the wording for. We will be buying her chocolates in the future for other events or even just for ourselves!

Cher from the Cookie Box is AMAZING, and her cookies are so WONDERFUL. Her unique cookies will peak anyone's curiousity & once they have one cookie, they will not be able to stop! We got Original, Lemon & Earl Grey Cookies. Cher did a wonderful job on making all the cookies match our colors (yellow & black). The cookies looked amazing and tasted even better! Cher is willing to work with any budget, any colors. She also has delicious scones that would go great with a coffee bar at a wedding! Cupcakes are also available. But the cookies are her thing & they are amazing!!!

I got truffles from the victorian chocolate shoppe to give as favors to our guests. Every person I talked to commented on how great the truffles tasted. They looked very presentable on the tables and had a variety of different packing options for us to choose from. The price of the truffles at the Victorian Chocolate Shoppe was almost half of what the cost was at a different chocolate shop in town and the quality was just as good, if not better! And that price even included them packaging the truffles for us (this would not have been included at the other shop!). Amazing truffles and service. I would definitely recommend them.

Of all the vendors I worked with for my wedding, The Album Factory was by far the easiest, responsive, and dependable vendor! The quality of service was great! Anytime I had a question or comment or wanted something to be corrected on the program, I always got a quick response that was ALWAYS professional! My friends and family loved the wedding programs and thought it was the coolest thing they had ever seen at a wedding! Truly a hit! I would highly recommend this vendor to anyone who's looking to do something different. Whatever vision you have, The Album Factory can make it happen!

We wanted to have a popcorn bar with different flavors for our guests to pick from. End of the Trail was so easy and so very friendly to work with. I did everything over the phone, the first time I called I was going to drive 2.5 hours to get samples, the lady next day aired samples for us to try...for free! She sent 8 bags of popcorn, everything was so good! We ended up getting three different flavors and they delivered everything for us to our hotel prior to the wedding. All of our guests commented how good the popcorn was and asked where we had gotten it from.
