My Dream Wedding

We cannot recommend Emily and Janciz at City Club enough! They truly were the dream team that made our wedding experience completely stress-free and enjoyable, both during the planning process and on the big day.  
From our very first consultation, they were incredibly organized, proactive, and responsive. Planning a wedding can be overwhelming, but Emily and Janciz were always ten steps ahead, ensuring every detail was covered well in advance. Their level of professionalism and expertise was immediately apparent.  
We had to go back and forth on the Banquet Event Order many times because some things we thought would be fun to add (lamb shanks, french fry station, etc.) ended up compounding in price with surcharges and taxes. But, they were very willing to help us with our requests. They made us feel completely supported and heard throughout the entire journey.  
On the day of the wedding, everything ran flawlessly. They were constantly on top of every detail, allowing us to relax and fully immerse ourselves in the celebration. City Club is a beautiful venue, but Emily and Janciz are the incredible people who truly bring the experience to life.  
If you are considering City Club, you are in the best hands possible with Janciz!

Wedding of our Dreams

Having our wedding at The City Club San Francisco felt like a fantastic dream. We had a vision, and not only did the team at The City Club make it happen, but they were also willing to go above and beyond to make the process of building our wedding a breeze. They were super communicative. As someone who plans well ahead of time, the team made answering question and getting clarification easy. When it came to the wedding day, my husband and I did not have to think about our schedule or anything at all. We were completely taken care of and our guest loved it all. We are still hearing reviews from them about the venue, food and atmosphere. So glad we decided to get married and celebrate our love here.

Perfect venue

We had a wonderful experience start to finish with the venue and its coordinators Emily and Janciz.   
\- the building and all the architectural details were beautiful, including the tall ceilings and especially the very special Diego Rivera mural on the grand staircase  
\- the location was great for those flying in from out of town due to proximity to SFO  
\- the venue made planning easy because most things like linens, nice chairs, votives and uplights were included  
\- the coordinators were truly the best; all I can say is they were extremely professional and personable, which counts for more than you think when planning something of this scale with the huge number of moving parts and emails. They were flexible, patient, supportive, prompt, and approached delicate things with sensitivity. It was fun to work with them.  
\- We really enjoyed the food and got good feedback from guests (food quality was very important to us)  
\- Nearby there are several nice places for photos, including the grey columns around the corner (equinox gym) and the rooftop with skyline for a nice background above waist level.   
\- Interior is customizable with removing/adding furniture, lights, and various plants.  
\- the value was great especially for a winter wedding, considering the location, size, interesting art deco architecture, and tasty food  
  
Overall, it was a great experience with City Club, we highly recommend them.

Excellent!

In February 2023, we had the distinct pleasure of hosting our wedding at the City Club of San Francisco. When we were looking for venues, we were immediately drawn to the City Club's remarkable art deco architecture and Diego Rivera mural. That the City Club also provides all of the catering, furniture and table settings was a huge plus because it meant we did not have to coordinate rentals on our own. We and our guests were very impressed by the quality of the food. The City Club's downtown San Francisco location proved to be a logistical convenience for guests traveling from near and far. The rooftop, generously open to couples for sunset snapshots, provided a unique backdrop for photos that isn't typically accessible to the public. Some of our favorite photos from our wedding were taken on the roof with the Transamerica pyramid in the background. The City Club's event coordinator, Marie, proved to be an invaluable asset. Her guidance and attention to detail were instrumental in shaping the success of our wedding day. We truly appreciate the City Club for creating an incredible wedding day!

Perfect Venue for a Timeless Wedding

We got married at the city club on August 17th and we could not be happier!  
  
Our friends and family have not stopped talking about how wonderful our wedding was, all thanks to the City Club staff!   
  
Huge shout out to Taylor who went above and beyond to make our day super special. From taking care of the small details to just genuinely caring about us, she ensured our big day was incredible!  
  
There are simply not enough great things to say about this venue. The service staff is wonderful, the chef and kitchen creates incredible dining experiences and the Art Deco backdrop is stunning.  
  
You will not regret booking this gorgeous backdrop to showcase your love story!

What a wonderful venue!  
  
We recently had our wedding and reception at the City Club (5.12.18), and it was everything we hoped for and more. The venue itself is gorgeous; the vintage elements have been beautifully maintained, and so much care has been put into the details.   
  
The food and beverages were delicious. We opted for their 155 package which worked out to be an amazing deal, especially for the Bay Area. The appetizers were plentiful, as was the wine, and the entrees got rave reviews from the guests.   
  
However, what truly set the city club apart was their warm, gracious and professional staff. Juliette St. Andrew was our coordinator, and she did an excellent job making sure the event went flawlessly down to the last detail. I had ambitious plans, and Juliette was so generous and helpful in their execution! Sylvia cut our cake, and she had such a warm and graceful professionalism. When I dropped my cake off the day before, she greeted me and congratulated me with genuine kindness.  
  
To paraphrase my father, who was equally enamored with the entire experience, I'm not sure if personality is something the City Club looks for when hiring, or something that is engendered through their culture and standards, but we felt so genuinely welcomed and cared for throughout the night that I can't imagine having had our wedding in any other setting.  
  
If you are looking for a venue in downtown San Francisco, you will do yourself a great service by considering and checking out the City Club!

I cannot thank Cassie Harris and the entire team at The City Club for making my wedding day a flawless event. Everyone raved about the venue, food and service. My husband and I enjoyed ourselves just as much as the guests. The added bonus of using both the 10th and 11th floors made the event all the more special for everyone. Cassie and the team also worked collaboratively with my wedding planner and her assistant and all of my vendors. They were all consummate professionals and never seemed to break a sweat all night :)

I could not have imagined that my wedding would turn out as beautiful as it did. This is THE venue if you are looking for something unique that has that great, old-San Francisco feel... so different than the standard hotel ballroom. The wonderful thing about this venue is that it is already so beautiful with such rich colors and neat architecture throughout that there is no need for pipe and drape or a lot of extra fluff, which adds up so quickly. The club also provides up lighting, so there is no need to hire an extra vendor for that either. This place really does it ALL. I was planning my wedding from half-way across the country and all 90 guests were from out-of-town, so this was a true destination wedding. I cannot convey how much easier it was finding a venue like the City Club that housed everything I needed under one roof. Ceremony/reception venue, tables/chairs/linens, bar, dinner, lighting, furniture… the only THREE vendors I had to work with outside of the City Club were a florist, a DJ, and a bakery for the cake. Not having to coordinate with 8+ vendors made the whole process so much nicer. I worked with Alexi and I cannot thank her enough for all her hard work not only executing the wedding, but everything leading up; answering my emails, providing cost-savings where she could, giving me options, being flexible, going above and beyond. Everything start to finish was perfect. My guests loved the food, as well! I don’t know how they managed to put out so many plates of salmon and beef filets that are so perfectly cooked, but they nailed it. Food was really important to us and everything was wonderful from the cocktail hour appetizers to our dinner entrees. I couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out & would recommend this venue to any bride that either lives out-of-state or local that wants a more simplified planning process and wants a venue that’s completely different & unique! Thank you Alexi & City Club staff for making our wedding so special!

The City Club of San Francisco was the perfect venue for our wedding reception. From the Diego Rivera mural to the attentive/friendly service staff and amazingly preserved art deco interior we could not have asked for more. Not to mention the attentive, detail oriented Sales and Catering Manager (Donna) that made sure everything ran smoothly every step of the way. Recommend the delicious peppered steak and halibut for the entrees and the crab cakes! The Catering Manager also takes the role of outside vendor coordinator, making sure that all of the parties involved combine and result in a wedding reception masterpiece. They were willing to meet with us and be flexible about our different asks and accommodating to make our day just like we envisioned. Wedding sizes big or small, The City Club delivers the best San Francisco wedding experience.

I LOVE the art deco look of the City Club, but the staff really shines. Sandy and her team were fantastic on what would have been a VERY hard, but stunning event. They really work well with the other event professionals, and just go above and beyond.

I always love photographing at The City Club. It is such a beautiful place for a wedding!

As a preferred vendor of The City Club of San Francisco, we have always been impressed with the professionalism of the staff, the quality of the food they've served, and the old-world elegance of the venue. I would highly recommend them!
