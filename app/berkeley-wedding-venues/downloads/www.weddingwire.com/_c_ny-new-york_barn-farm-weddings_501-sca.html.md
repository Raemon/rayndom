We held our wedding here in December 2024, and it truly exceeded our expectations. I scheduled the venue visit pretty soon after I got engaged, and absolutely fell in love with the atrium. We snagged one of the last Saturdays available within 12 months, so definitely plan ahead if you’re interested in specific dates/times of the year. Payments throughout the months leading up to the date were easy and there was always active communication regarding these payments, tastings, wedding showcases, menu choices, etc. Patricia helped us out throughout the entire process, staying positive, answering all of our questions, and making the process so easy. The day of the wedding, we arrived and it was so wonderful to go through the wedding day knowing that everyone at the venue was on the same page taking care of us. Everything I brought in (photos of us, welcome mirror, escort cards, guest book, etc) was set-up perfectly! The food was amazing (the pork chop is a star!!!). Throughout the night, our Maitre D’ Andy and Bridal Attendant Debbie were absolute gems. My dress only had one loop for a bustle, so it broke three times throughout the night. Debbie and Andy were both on their hands and knees helping to secure my dress. Additionally, one of my guests squatted a bit too fast and ripped through his pants. I immediately started calling for Debbie and she handled it quickly and with such kindness. Both Andy and Debbie were checking in constantly with us throughout the night, taking care of our parents and wedding party, and I really felt like I could lean on them for anything. Everyone at the venue has such an attention for detail that it was so nice knowing we could truly enjoy the moment without needing to worry about timelines, small snafus, or other logistical things. We truly felt so taken care of, and everyone at Flowerfield were such warm people and consummate professionals. As someone who personally researched tons of LI wedding venues, Flowerfield genuinely is the whole package, and we absolutely loved hosting our wedding here. I genuinely would go through the stress of planning my wedding again if it meant I could experience it at Flowerfield all over again.

This was a perfect venue. Originally, we chose it for the food - the chefs are all CIA trained and the menu was very important to my husband. As we continued to work with them, Serena was wonderful. As an event planner myself, I appreciated her knowledge and professionalism, and her willingness to make just about anything I asked for happen. Everything ran smoothly from start to finish, she made a number of excellent suggestions for things I hadn't even thought of that I incorporated into the day and, at the end of the night, she airdropped me something like 70 photos that she'd been taking throughout the day, which were wonderful to look through the next morning. I had an excellent experience here, and I would absolutely book another big event with Birch Hill and Serena.

The wild flowers with the sunflower combo make the perfect back splash for beautiful wedding pictures. The pond and the gazebo make beautiful spaces for pictures as well. We had a wedding with 80 guest and still had so much room for the dance floor as well as appetizer/food tables (if doing a buffet style). The small bar area is nice if a bartender is on sight as well.

Our wedding at the old field club was an absolute dream. It was the most beautiful setting exactly what I had envisioned and more. From the moment we arrived, everything felt magical, and I truly had the best wedding day. The staff was incredible. Everyone was so attentive, kind, and on top of every detail. Our maître d’, Mike, was phenomenal. He took care of us and our guests the entire night, made sure everything ran smoothly, and always checked in to make sure we had whatever we needed. And the food was amazing. Our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was! I couldn’t be happier with our experience. The venue, the staff, the food, and the entire atmosphere made our day unforgettable. Highly, highly recommend!

From the moment we arrived at the inn we were catered to in such thoughtful and kind ways. Eugenia and Kelly were above and beyond helpful. And my 90 year old mom and 93 year old step dad raved about Eugenia’s attention to details. Colin’s food was spoken about throughout the day as nothing short of spectacular. The inn staff at the cocktail reception and in the barn were very professional and courteous. However, you don’t get a superior experience if it doesn’t start and trickle down from the top. Lia and Ilias have created in absolutely first class experience that will last in our minds for years to come. We’ll see you for our first anniversary!!! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

Hayloft on the Arch was the absolute perfect wedding venue and the owner Alisha made it the easiest day for me. From the beginning of the wedding planning process Alisha sold the venue as she was easy to talk to, flexible, kind and so invested in making my wedding day everything I wanted it to be. She responds quickly with helpful answers and was so detailed in what she needed to make the day run smoothly. On the wedding day she perfectly and seamlessly organized and setup the venue to my exact vision and was so kind while doing it. Her venue is clean, well organized, and was the perfect outdoor/indoor venue and having Alisha to work with makes it run so smooth and effortlessly. I could not recommend this venue and Alisha enough, absolutely amazing!!

If you're looking for a cozy and rustic Adirondack Mountain wedding venue with great views, food, and staff then Garnet Hill Lodge is the place you need to book! Nicole, Lucy, and all the staff at Garnet Hill Lodge were great to work with and truly made our wedding day incredible! We had a small intimate Monday wedding in October with 44 guests total. From the very beginning the communication with Nicole was great. She made the wedding planning process easy and her expertise is unmatched! A big reason we picked Garnet Hill Lodge was for their pavilion structure that serves as the backup rain plan, and we did end up having the ceremony in the pavilion due to rain. The wedding ceremony was still perfect as you can see the trees and mountains in the background from the clear covered side panels in the pavilion. The food is amazing at Garnet Hill Lodge - so many of our guests came up to us to say how great the food was. The drinks were also great and their bartender Josh was very nice! It was also super convenient that all our guests were able to stay onsite at the lodge on the night of the wedding. We highly recommend having your wedding at Garnet Hill Lodge!

We are so thrilled that we discovered the Historic Barns of Nipmoose for our October wedding. From our first interaction with Connie, the venue manager, it was clear that this was a special place and a team that puts immense care into the work that they do, and after visiting and seeing the grounds, we were enchanted. We felt really supported as we went through the wedding planning process and were so happy with the end result. Our guests could not stop raving about the natural beauty and charm of the barns -- we totally agree and are so happy that we got to celebrate our wedding at the Barns!

You pay for the venue and the bar package in one which is nicer than what other places offer. Compared to where you pay a large fee just to rent the place for the day and nothing else included! This was a great selling point for me and my husband that the bar was also included in your reservation package. The drinks were better than well for the cheapest package too! Also can pick any kegs of beer you want and they get them for you. If you’re having a smaller wedding and want a rustic vibe this is the best value for that! My guests all had a great time. Weather wasn’t on our side but we did a floor reset from ceremony to reception in under 5 minutes. ( assign your groomsmen that task if it happens to you) Mark was very responsive and flexible and was always there to answer questions via texts and calls even on his days off. (Sorry mark!) they were flexible with payments for to fit in around my work schedule and were all around a great group of people to work with. My guests loved the barn. My wedding was late fall and I was worried about it being cold and that was not the case I didn’t hear a single person say they were cold the heat is powerful and efficient when the barn doors are closed. All in all great memories were made at Freedom Run Winery!

We had an amazing experience for our wedding. We had great perks for free, which we were so grateful for. We had the pretzel bar, the champagne toast, and a free night stay as well. We had a beautiful venue as well as we were at the Garden pavilion. Now I want to talk about our coordinator the day of. We had Paige- who was AMAZING. absolutely everything you would want in a coordinator. She made me feel at ease with everything. She did amazing with the decoration set up, she was very organized and made sure everything went so smoothly. throughout the night. She went above and beyond with everything, and added so many extra beautiful touches to the decorations. She took things in stride when for example, my centerpieces weren't staying up and taped them to the wooden holders. Also, she was so great at directing such big groups of people so confidently. She also was so good at doing what the bride wanted. For example, we wanted more time on the dance floor, so Paige made sure that some of the other parts of the night went quicker, just the little things that meant so much. We were extremely impressed and grateful to have her and the rest of the team.
