## How much does a wedding planner cost?

A wedding planner can be an [absolute lifesaver](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-reasons-your-wedding-planner-is-a-total-lifesaver) for busy couples, ensuring that the planning process and actual event run smoothly. As a professional who’s been through the process before, they can also offer countless wedding planning recommendations and tips. It’s important to know wedding planning is not a one size fits all service - your wedding vision is unique and a wedding planner will customize their offering to fit your needs. Because of this and the wide range of services these professionals provide, pricing varies widely with most couples in the U.S. spending at least $1,500 on wedding planner services for their big day. Wedding planner costs also differ based on the planner’s level of expertise, among many other factors, as more experienced pros typically come with a higher price tag (and with that comes top-tier service!).

What services does a wedding planner's fee include?

__

The services a wedding planner’s cost includes vary depending on the [type of professional you’re hiring](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/the-7-types-of-wedding-planners-and-what-they-do) — whether it’s a full-service, month-of, or day-of planner, or a planner who specializes in [destination weddings](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/destination-weddings--t8). Here are [some of the most common services that your wedding planner may include](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/why-a-wedding-planner-costs-that-much) in his or her package:

  * Correspondence: About 30 percent of a wedding planner’s time is spent communicating with you and your vendors via email and phone. Think of your planner as the “coach” of your vendor team who ensures that all of your wedding pros work together well—and frequent communication is a huge part of that.
  * Venue and vendor selection: Your planner likely has a lot of connections in the wedding industry and can help you pick the right [venue](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-venues) and vendors that can help bring your wedding vision to life. Often, your planner will attend interviews and meetings with you and your vendors, too.
  * Organization: A big part of wedding planning is... paperwork? Yes, unfortunately it’s true. But wedding planners can make sure that all of your budgets, contracts, timelines, etc. are properly organized and easily accessible if needed.
  * Wedding prep: There are lots of seemingly small tasks that go into creating your perfect day both before and on the day-of from creating a [wedding-day timeline](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-timeline), assembling invitations, setting up your favor display, assisting with your [seating chart](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-create-your-wedding-seating-chart), and much more.
  * Day-of coordination: You might not see your wedding planner much on the day of your wedding—and that’s how it should be! Your planner will arrive long before your ceremony begins and stay well afterwards, making sure that everything runs on-time and smoothly from behind-the-scenes and [any issues are handled](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-fiascos-and-how-wedding-planners-solved-them) quickly and quietly so that you and your new spouse can enjoy the day, stress-free!
  * Post-wedding tasks: There will likely be several important tasks to handle after the wedding, from ensuring clean-up and breakdown occur properly to returning rental items and making sure vendors receive their tips.



What wedding events does a planner's fee cover?

__

In most cases, a wedding planner will assist with the wedding itself—both ceremony and reception. However, if you are able to increase your wedding planning budget and costs, your planner can also help plan your rehearsal dinner and post-wedding brunch. If you’re having a destination wedding with lots of events over the course of the weekend, your planner may assist with those as well—but expect to pay more. 

How much does a day-of wedding planner cost?

__

A day-of wedding planner isn’t heavily involved in the wedding planning process and is usually hired closer to the wedding, but has a big role to play on the wedding day, ensuring that the events run on time and everything is running smoothly. On average, the starting cost for a day-of wedding planner in the U.S. is $800 with starting rates for higher-end planners averaging $1,250 to $3,395. 

How much does a partial wedding planner cost?

__

A partial wedding planner usually comes on board a month or so before the wedding day and assists with last-minute tasks—helping with the seating chart, confirming vendors, and day-of responsibilities. The average starting rate for a partial wedding planner in the U.S. comes in at $1,250, but can range from $2,300 to $6,000 if you’re working with a more experienced pro. 

How much does a full wedding planner cost?

__

A full wedding planner helps to plan your wedding from start to finish and is usually hired early on in the planning process—at least 10 months in advance. The average starting rate for a full service wedding planner in the U.S is about $3,000 with top-tier planners averaging $4,500 to $12,000.

Our wedding day turned out absolutely wonderful! From the very beginning, Zhanna was attentive, professional, and incredibly easy to work with. She took the time to understand our vision, listened to every little wish, and made sure everything came together beautifully — all while keeping us comfortably within our budget. Throughout the planning process, she guided us with great care and attention to detail. Every question we had was answered quickly, and every idea we shared was thoughtfully considered. We always felt that we were in good hands. On the wedding day itself, everything flowed perfectly — from the ceremony to the reception, every moment was seamless and full of joy. Our guests kept telling us how lovely, well-organized, and stress-free the whole day felt. We’re so thankful to Zhanna for making our dream wedding come true. It was truly the best day of our lives

Lauren’s attention to detail on our special day was worth every penny. It took all of the stress off of our day. You have one shot at this special time and you want it to be right and it was!! There are so many things you don’t think about for this day that she does. Highly recommend Lauren!

Linda, at Design Exclusive, was a joy to work with in designing and planning the layout of our wedding. Her eye for design and attention to detail was impressive. She brought the whimsical beauty that I could only imagine but barely put into words, as if she was reading my mind. Love, love love!

Living Moments, and especially Christyna, were an absolute joy to work with! I, unfortunately, thought that I could handle our wedding all on my lonesome! As the day got closer I realized that I couldn't make sure things were happening behind the scenes during the ceremony... or while I was having my hair and make up done. For a type A, DIY person, this brought a lot of anxiety. Who could I trust to bring about the vision I had in my head of our special day?!?? Well... Christyna took us on with barely 3 weeks until wedding day and everything was amazing!! It was exactly as I pictured it and I was able to actually enjoy myself. I'm beyond grateful to her and this amazing company!

The day went without a hitch thanks to Renee’s flawless coordination. She allowed us to be fully present and focus on our big day, never once making it feel like she took over or intervened too much. Her balance of professionalism and discretion was exactly what we needed. From the planning phase through the last dance, she kept everything organized and stress-free. Vendors were managed seamlessly, the schedule ran perfectly on time, and any small hiccups were handled quietly before we even noticed. Guests kept commenting on how smooth everything felt, which is all thanks to her.

5 star wedding event coordinator right here!! I worked with Jacque as an additional wedding day coordinator during a wedding at the wedding Venue I work for. She was impeccable with her communication and essential with the planning process, running the timeline for the day and keeping up with the needs of vendors, guests and wedding party attendees. She also created and executed a gorgeous design and helped with the decor and set up of the wedding venue. Jacque is a fantastic addition to help make your wedding day vision become reality.

We worked with Alexandra and the Luna & Co. team for over 1.5 years to plan our wedding. Throughout that entire time, Alexandra was nothing short of SPECTACULAR! She understood our vision, helped us find vendors that were personalized to our wedding and style, gave us helpful reminders and suggestions, and just made our whole wedding planning experience A LOT LESS STRESSFUL! On top of this, when a tornado hit St. Louis two weeks before our wedding and derailed parts of our big day, she put in so much extra time and work to problem solve and coordinate plan B's and C's with us. Her service went so far above the usual call of duty, we were just blown away. I know that she would do the same for any of her couples, because she understands what this day means for everyone involved in the event (brides/grooms, parents, attendees, etc). Alexandra and our day of coordinator Molly truly made our dreams come true and I know that you will have an amazing experience as well! Thank you again!

We hired Allison as our weekend coordinator for our wedding and it was one of the best decisions we made. I was very stressed prior to the wedding, and could finally relax and enjoy the rehearsal and wedding day. Allison was extremely organized and gave us some helpful advice. Her wedding timeline was very helpful! She really helped us stay on track with time the day of the wedding. My only regret is I wish we could have hired her sooner and ordered a bigger planning package so I would have had her help earlier on in the planning process.
