I am so happy that I found Heather to make our wedding invitations. I spent a long time searching for just the right invite design and could not find it anywhere. I found Heather on Etsy and decided to send her a message to see if she could make the invitation I saw in my head. She replied very quickly and was very excited to work with my idea. I told her the overall idea and look I was going for, and let her design it as she saw fit - she is the expert after all! Once she sent me the first draft, she happily took my few notes in stride, making the changes I requested. I also ended up sending her a fabric swatch to get the right color, which she matched perfectly. Her quality of work is excellent. The finished product was gorgeous, and we received so many complements on our invitations. Plus, considering all the work she puts into the design and actual screen printing of the invitations, reply cards, and addresses on all the envelopes, her prices are great. Really nice invitations are shockingly expensive, and considering that this was a custom design that was hand-printed, I really think we got quite the bargain. I also emailed her a couple weeks before the wedding to learn what the names were of the fonts used on the invitations so I could make my own programs, and she sent along the links and files for both, which was so helpful. I highly recommend the work of HeatherJeany, and have been doing so already to all my friends and family!

I created my own design for invitations on Photoshop and sent them to Winkflash to be printed. I had several different options to choose from. They turned out great and were printed on 5x7 photo paper with envelope for 29 cents a piece. You can even have them shipped to different addresses which really worked for me! I mailed some to my mom, some to my mother-in-law and some to myself to address and mail. My only complaint was my third order took 4 weeks to be printed and shipped, and it was the smallest. The other two orders arrived quickly!

My daughter and I so enjoyed working with Pam. She truly took my daughters vision for the invitation and brought it to life. The end result was stunning and the feedback we received was amazing! She truly looks at every aspect of the wedding design and incorporates it into the invitations and day of items (menu cards, programs). And, she was great fun to work with! Highly recommend Pam and PDR Events!

A family member offered to design my wedding invitations, but a last-minute move across country put a damper on that possibility. So, with less than a month before I wanted to get my save the dates out (and little money budgeted for all paper goods from the wedding!) I found Sofia. She immediately calmed my nerves and designed a wedding "motif" that carried through from the STDs to the wedding reception. Her work was incredible and she was quite receptive to changes I asked her to make. Her prices were beyond reasonable, and I received more compliments on the beauty and uniqueness of the paper goods than I could have imagined. I personally did not have difficulty getting in touch with Sofia, and I often found that I owed her a response! Thankfully, Sofia was incredibly patient with me (I have a very stressful and busy job), and she was able to produce incredible products in a short period of time. I was also thrilled with the seating chart, table numbers, Instagram hashtag table tents, and "Wedding libs" (like mad libs), Sofia prepared for us. She also created a beautiful program, despite that I didn't finalize the church ceremony until under 1 week before the wedding. (I also should note that I decided I wanted the wedding libs less than 2 weeks before the wedding, AND I wanted two different versions, and she made it happen.) In addition, my mom got my shower invitations from Sofia and they were stunning. Everyone loved them, and Sofia then created the perfect thank-you notes that drew from the designs in the invitation. She's immensely artistic and creative! I recommend Sofia for your paper good needs, and I now wish that I needed invitations on a regular basis, because her products are so incredible!

We cannot recommend DWRI, and especially Lois Harada, for any stationary needs one might have, but especially for weddings. Every single piece of stationery that they designed and produced for us has been absolutely perfect and gorgeous, and we've lost count of all the different compliments people have given us. (Like, how often are people still talking about the Save the Dates AT the wedding?? Because they were at ours!!) Lois and the staff at DWRI have been such a kind and generous help to us, and we've loved every time we've been able to come in and meet to discuss different elements. Certainly if there are any other stationery needs that we run into in the future (or if anyone we know is looking for something stationery related), we will point them to DWRI.

saw these invites in martha stewart wedding magazine and find it strange i had to add this vendor. i used the world traveller collection. they were perfect for our theme.... and not too theme-y. very tasteful. actually showed my sample to another vendor who was way impressed and said she didn't have anything like it. if you want something special this is the way to go. makenzie is lovely. answered all my questions and made suggestions for how best to accommodate my needs. i was very happy with the outcome!

Lesli-Ann did a fabulous job on our wedding invitations. She took the time to work with me and my husband on the type of invitation that was specific to our needs. She was very reasonable in price.
