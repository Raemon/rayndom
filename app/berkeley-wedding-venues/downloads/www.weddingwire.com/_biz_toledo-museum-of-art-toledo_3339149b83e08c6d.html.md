The Great Gallery in the Toledo Museum of Art is a beautiful venue to have a wedding ceremony if you do not prefer to have a religious ceremony.

We were married on Oct. 2 2010 in the Cloister at the Toledo Museum of Art. I have to say that the experience could not have been better! The staff worked with us to answer any and all questions we had and I always had an answer within 12 hours, usually within one or two hours as the wedding date approached. Another great point for me is that I was able to communicate exclusively in email. I just don't have time to make calls during the day so the ability to use email was a highlight for me. Kerri Devol was my contact and she was amazing and extremely professional! Other brides I know who were married at the museum also echo that feeling. I came down with a massive cold the week before the wedding and wasn't thinking clearly the day of the wedding and forgot to bring drinks to the museum for the time prior to the ceremony and I was feeling dehydrated. Kerri jumped into action and found us a huge selection of drinks and ice and beautiful glass goblets to use. She said it was just part of her job, but it really helped me out (so someone didn't have to run to the store) and it's the little things that can make the day fun and relaxing or stressful. Another bonus was that the space was already remarkably lovely decor wise. There really wasn't a reason to have additional flower arrangements, it would have detracted from the inherent beauty of the Cloister. I really can't say enough about my experience with TMA, if you love art as I do, or would simply like an amazing wedding location, consider the Toledo Museum of Art.

It was so great to have the wedding at the art museum. We were able to have the reception in one of the galleries I have loved since I was a child. Also, they opened up many of the other galleries for my guests to wander around during the reception. Overall, I would recommend having your special event here.

Kerri and all of the staff at the Musum were wonderful. Kerri did an excellent job dealing with one of my vendors that was "difficult" to say the least. We held our ceremony in the Great Gallery and it was absolutely beautiful! If I could do it again, I would.
