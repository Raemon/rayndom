Simply amazing

We had the best day celebrating our wedding at Pittsburgh botanic garden. We held our entire reception in the barn and it was the perfect space for our intimate wedding. The staff were very helpful throughout the whole process and our rehearsal and wedding day flowed so smoothly. Also there are so many beautiful locations on site for pictures. I would highly recommend having your wedding or other special event here!

Such a beautiful venue!

PBG was such a beautiful wedding for our wedding on 5/20/2023. We loved being able to make the space our own and have both indoor and outdoor options. We also had so many great spots throughout the garden for photos as well. Having preferred vendors for rentals and catering also made coordinating easy. The events team was also very easy to work with as well. Thank you for giving me my dream wedding!

The most naturally beautiful, rustic venue for your wedding!

This venue is an absolute dream! The team we had leading up to the big day and the day of (thank you Emily, Jenna, and Abby!!) is what makes this place work, and they all seem to be seasoned and professional. Everyone is very nice, always willing to lend a hand, and open to all questions. That’s not even to mention the space itself is stunningly beautiful; whether you’re inside or outside, the place is gorgeous. The customization lent by Ambassador Tent Rental is very handy too, and you can completely make the space your own and exactly what you want.

So glad we chose PBG!

Pittsburgh Botanic Garden was the perfect venue for our October wedding. We got married in the garden in the midst of gorgeous fall colors, enjoyed cocktails and cookies in the barn, then danced the night away under the stars! The outdoor fireplace and s'mores provided the perfect cozy touch.

Easy and beautiful venue for our microwedding 

The Botanic Garden was a fantastic spot for our wedding 10/6/22. We had less than 20 guests, but the staff made sure to treat it just as special as a wedding with 200 guests. Everyone we worked with was kind, professional, knowledgable, and easy to work with. They were totally on board with whatever we chose whether it was traditional or not. They worked well with our families and wedding planner. The do require you pick vendors from a list, but the ones we used (Ambassador Tent Rental and Rania's Catering) were wonderful. The day was a dream come true and we'd recommend the venue to anyone looking for a gorgeous and easy outdoor venue for their special day.

Best Venue in Pittsburgh!

The minute that we toured Pittsburgh Botanic Garden we knew it was the perfect place for our September wedding. We planned out wedding mostly on our own and they were so helpful from start to finish. They recommended vendors, promptly replied to even the smallest questions and really made our day perfect. Gina W. was our on site lead for the day of and she did a spectacular job the entire weekend! She really put our minds at ease and adapted quickly to any changes or issues that came up. We were thrilled with the service and would choose PBG again in a heart beat!

Gorgeous and Comfortable Venue

I liked it so much here that we got married there! I was gorgeous; hummingbirds and butterflies joined our ceremony and the staff helped us roll through the unpredictable chaos of a wedding day. The reception provided so many different kinds of areas for people to sit quietly by a fire, have kids run around playing yards games, have a drink by the bar, sit and talk at the tables or dance the night away in the barn. There was something for everyone but you still felt like you were celebrating together

Romantic and natural!

We held our wedding at PBG in May 2022 after two years of waiting. It was well worth it! The venue is a fairytale dream come true — elegance held in a secret garden atmosphere. Working with Emily and the event staff was easy from beginning to end. We took photos in the Japanese garden and the meadows, and the convenience of having everything in one spot was SO nice! We also had a quartet and band, and the acoustics sounded great. There’s a reason many weddings are held here, book today!

10/10 from every angle

Three cheers for the team at PBG! Thank you so much to Ashley, and Bailey who helped make our wedding absolutely perfect. From the start when we toured the venue with Ashley, we knew PBG was going to be fabulous to work with. During our tour Ashley shared tips and tricks on things like shuttles and catering, all the while also making sure we felt at ease/not pressured to make an immediate decision (Even though we did! Since we loved it so much).  
  
Having an outdoor wedding was important to my husband and I since one of the things we love the most is to be outside together (hiking, biking, climbing). PBG struck the perfect balance, filled with flowers/plants/wildlife, outdoors, a little rustic, but all within a 30 minute drive of downtown Pittsburgh.  
  
Throughout the planning process Ashley and the PBG team were fantastic—super organized. They kept our planning on course and were flexible when a few weeks before the wedding we realized we needed to add on a set-up package given the reality of our day of timeline. I’ll also say this was all during the 2021 wedding season, which was crazy due to the number of weddings postponed due to COVID like ours.  
  
During the rehearsal and on the day of, the whole team was great! The rehearsal and drop off of decor/alcohol was smooth and every detail was placed as if a family member had done so.  
  
10/10 from every angle!

Simply beautiful 

The Pittsburgh Botanic Gardens was our dream venue, and it exceeded all of our expectations! Ashley and her team were so helpful in all aspects. They were kind, joyful, and helped everything run smoothly on the big day. We had on and off rain and they had several back up plans ready to go. The entire facility - gardens, barn, tent, etc. have so much natural and timeless beauty! We also got the yard games and our guests loved them, especially the corn hole! We can’t wait to go back and visit over the years.
