Can't Recommend Enough!

We had an excellent all-around experience with Chef Prasad. He was highly responsive and communicative in the months leading up to the wedding. He was patient with our numerous changes and feedback on the menu. Chef Prasad ultimately provided us with a reasonable price, considering the quality and complexity of our menu. Many of the wedding attendees went out of their way to compliment the food and noted it was the best they've had before. We highly recommend Chef Prasad and hope we get an opportunity to try his food again soon!

Exceptional must hire!

I cannot recommend Chef Prasad catering highly enough for your wedding! We are close family friends with Uncle Prasad and only trust his expertise in Indian and fusion cuisine. We are regular customers of his restaurant in New Canaan, CT. His food is high quality, presented beautifully, tasty, and his team's service is exceptional. My family also uses Chef Prasad catering for many family events at our home. He never fails to amaze us and impress us with his creations. He tailored an irresistible menu for us that included both Indian and Italian dishes as we had a multicultural wedding celebration. Our wedding was in 2024 and we and all of our guests are still talking about how incredible the food was and all the options. We used Chef Prasad catering for two of our events, both were completely different and festive in their own way, and fitting to the formality of each event. We had both buffet style and station style dinner services. Chef Prasad made our wedding so special and memorable. Thank you Uncle Prasad & team, we are eternally grateful!

Outstanding!

For our daughter’s wedding, we tasted food at many restaurants and decided to go with Chef Prasad due to being a whole level above everyone else. Due to guests being both with Indian and western taste, Chef catered the food suiting to guests with varied preferences of type of food. There were three events planned at a resort, music & dance night, wedding and reception. Food was outstanding in both taste and presentation. All our guests wholeheartedly praised our choice and even took pictures of food served. Thanks to Chef Prasad for making a huge difference in the outcome of a once in a lifetime event of our daughter’s wedding.
