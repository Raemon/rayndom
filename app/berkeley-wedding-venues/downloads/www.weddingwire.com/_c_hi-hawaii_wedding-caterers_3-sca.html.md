We are still raving about the food at our Maui wedding! Every dish was absolutely delicious, beautifully presented, and perfectly suited to our wedding style and location. From appetizers to the main course and late-night snacks, the flavors were incredible, and every detail was executed with care and precision. Our guests couldn’t stop complimenting the variety, quality, and freshness of the food. The team was incredibly kind and attentive, making us feel completely cared for throughout the entire process. Tina, the owner, made us feel so welcome and special during our tasting, guiding us with her expertise and genuine warmth—it truly set the tone for the whole experience. On our wedding day, the service was seamless, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy every bite. We highly recommend this catering team for anyone who wants outstanding food, beautiful presentation, and genuinely kind, attentive service. They helped make our Maui wedding day unforgettable and absolutely delicious!

my husband and I got married on 6/10/22 at Moli'i Gardens and hired Memoirs for our food and bar. After researching many caterers on island we were most interested in Memiors due to their locally sources food. The oysters during out cocktail hour came form Moli'i pond of which our guests were literally looking at while eating the apps! doesn't get much better than that! and that alone should speak for how fresh all the food was. Our guests were definitely impressed by the quality of food and also really loved the "family style" service they offered which allows for people to get a little taste of everything without having a buffet line. They are definitely not the cheapest option on island, by the quality of food was super important my husband and I. and you'll soon realize that the price of caterers are still pretty expensive, sooo might as well get the real deal so you will literally not have to worry about how the food will taste or how the service will go bc you are hiring the best! 10/10 would recommend

I've sure all of us have been to weddings that the food was only subpar. The Catering Connections was the complete opposite! everyone was still talking about the food MONTHS after the wedding. & the team of people they brought to help with our wedding were OUTSTANDING! Sherese was an absolute gem to work with! she answered all our questions in a timely fashion & helped us with securing alcohol for our big day. thank you so much The Catering Connections for making our big day a success!

Aloha Events did a fantastic job catering our wedding. I have been to several weddings where the food has been just ok as I know it can be challenging to serve a large number of people, but not for Michelle and her staff. When we were in the beginning planning stages we had looked at several venues including some very nice hotels, but after doing a tasting with Chef I knew we needed to pick a venue where we could bring them along. My new husband and I are huge foodies and their menu takes the cake. Everyone said how delicious the food was. We served filet, chicken and fish dishes. The appetizers were probably my favorite, the ahi poke was phenomenal! The desserts were also delicious they even did coffee and mini donuts for us. Also a huge plus we provided the alcohol so when we had leftover un-open bottles we were able to return them to Costco. Her staff was quite amazing; you hardly knew they were there while quickly picking up empty plates and glasses. They also were very good at quickly serving drinks and apps making sure everyone was taken care of. They also did a great job with my wishes to serve beer and water in glasses instead of in cans and bottles because I hate the way that looks in pictures. Thank you Aloha Events!

Everyone we spoke to recommended having our catering done by Mark's Place. I'm so glad we did. They were organized, professional and had an exceptional menu. They understood that we wanted our food to be part of the focus of our day and they did not disappoint. I even spotted a server going out of his way to find my mom to deliver her the last of our shrimp skewer appetizers. We decided on small deserts instead of ordering a separate wedding cake. We were able to create a delicious, personalized menu within our budget. We created our own wedding cocktails and everything came out perfect!

My husband and I chose the Wedding Special #1 buffet and added a roasted hog carving station. The pupus and dinner was amazing, all of our guests were raving about the food! The staff came up to us and made sure we had eaten everything we wanted and made sure to save a plate of pupus for us while we were taking pictures! Highly recommend Keneke’s!

I highly recommend!

Aloha on the Rocks made our wedding day truly unforgettable! They provided outstanding day-of coordination, bartending services, catering, shave ice, and so much more. From start to finish, their team went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly despite unexpected challenges. Shaun Henderson, the owner, was an absolute pleasure to work with in the weeks leading up to our big day. He meticulously organized our timelines and layouts and provided a detailed document outlining what went on each table during the pre-ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. His attention to detail and clear communication gave us so much peace of mind. The food was absolutely rave-worthy. Our guests couldn't stop talking about how delicious everything was! The shave ice was a brilliant touch that brought an authentic taste of Hawaii to our celebration. It was such a unique and fun addition that everyone loved. Special shout-out to our day-of coordinator, Brigid, who was an absolute rock star. When torrential rain poured down at the end of our ceremony, I was so worried about our guests and how the rest of the day would unfold. Brigid quickly jumped in, pivoting plans seamlessly to keep the event going. She kept us calm and ensured that every detail was taken care of. Despite the rain and mud, we ended the night dancing in the Kualoa mud with our guests, smiling and loving every second of it. Even the servers were dancing and joyous, lifting everyone’s spirits and making the rain feel like part of the magic. Aloha on the Rocks didn’t just handle the logistics—they helped create memories we’ll treasure forever. Thank you to Shaun, Brigid, and the entire team for turning what could have been a stressful day into an extraordinary celebration filled with joy, love, and aloha. We are endlessly grateful!
