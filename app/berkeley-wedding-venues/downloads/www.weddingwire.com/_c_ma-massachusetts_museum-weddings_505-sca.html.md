Space (5/5) – our wedding package included a reception in the main atrium which was more than enough to fit our wedding of about 110 people. The reception was preceded by a cocktail hour in a large room separate from the atrium as well as the museum’s garden space, weather permitting. After the cocktail hour, guests also walked through exhibits to reach the atrium. For the Couple, we took photos in the garden as well as half-a-dozen of our favorite exhibits. The PEM also had a private room for us and the wedding party to eat and recuperate before the reception. The only downside was the East India Marine hall was under construction so we were unable to use that room. Staff (5/5) – The staff was a major part of why we were able to focus on just enjoying our wedding on the day. After months of planning, we had zero doubts about the PEM. Everyone we worked with was professional, friendly, and accommodating. Natalia helped us coordinate with staff at the PEM and catering. PEM allowed us to tour the museum to get an idea of the layout for our vendors. They answered all our questions, took us to the loading docks, showed us people’s favorite exhibits for photos. The staff was more than happy to hold onto items for us before and after the reception. And, the PEM had very clear boundaries which they explained. For example, the museum must be open to the public until the day of the wedding, any cash at the wedding cannot be handled staff, no soil in the flowers as it could damage the exhibits, etc. Communication was quick, clear, and friendly. We did not use a wedding planner and the PEM staff were still able to get everything set up just fine. Budget (4/5) – the PEM venue fee is expensive but not unlike other venues in and around Boston, and the money goes to a museum to help preserve and educate about history. For the space and atmosphere of the museum I think it is worth it. For catering, the PEM allows only their specific partner Gourmet Caterers. Gourmet Caterers had several tiers of catering and alcohol for different budget levels. With the venue fee and only one choice of caterer, much of the budget is set before making any decisions. The PEM also has some additional options such as higher quality chairs which you can forgo to reduce expenses. Location (5/5) – the PEM is located in the heart of Salem. It was very pedestrian friendly. There are dozens of shops, events, and locations to explore. The PEM’s location made it feel like we rented the entire town of Salem rather than just the PEM.

Having our wedding at Plimoth Patuxet was one of the best decisions we made. David was incredibly organized, responsive, and helpful—he answered all my (many!) questions promptly and made the entire planning process effortless. The garden ceremony site was absolutely stunning and felt so private and intimate—it couldn’t have been more perfect. We’ve received countless compliments on the food, especially the beef short rib, which was a guest favorite! We’re so grateful to David and his team for going above and beyond to make our day truly seamless and unforgettable.

Sheryl and the MOS team were amazing! In addition to the beautiful space, we felt very taken care of before and during our wedding. The team's calm guidance and ability to quickly respond and change plans helped make what could have been a weather disaster into the most memorable wedding possible! Both the indoor and outdoor spaces are a gorgeous place to host your wedding.

We had our wedding at MASS MoCA this past Spring. From the moment we visited, we knew the venue was special. Chris made everything so easy and made sure everything went smoothly from rehearsal to the big day. We can't thank him and the MASS MoCA team enough for being so amazing!

On July 5, 2025 we got married at the Falmouth Museums on the Green. It was a beautiful wedding ceremony and reception (I believe now only ceremonies are allowed). Rachel was great to connect with and the rental amount was very affordable. The venue itself was a gorgeous spot and exactly what we were looking for. My only upset is we were promised the lawn would be mowed and when we arrived to set up the lawn was in terrible shape (super tall and filled with weeds everywhere)- we would have gladly volunteered to mow the lawn if we were given proper notice (and as mentioned it was told to us it was going to be freshly mowed). Unfortunately, it compromised the clean garden look we were going for and we received no follow-up after sending the email requesting someone come fix it. You can see the weeds everywhere in the photos for reference. It was definitely very upsetting and not appropriate for a wedding. However- if you are on top of them from the start about cleaning up the grass (and maybe a power wash to the deck ahead of time), you will absolutely love this charming venue.

My wife and I got married on August 9, 2025 at the New England Aquarium. The venue was everything we could ask for. The ceremony took place outdoors beyond the Aquarium overlooking the harbor. You could see the planes taking off in the distance and the gorgeous skyline of the Seaport/East Boston—it was a serene place to have our ceremony. We had our cocktail hour inside the main aquarium exhibit halls, which our guests loved. It was so fun to have a drink while watching the penguins or being mesmerized by the large talk. We had our reception outdoors in the harbor side tent. We hired a florals and lighting to really brought the space to life. The aquarium staff set up everything so beautifully and elegantly. The service was efficient with plates being brought out and cleared promptly. We ate, cried, laughed and danced the night away. It was a magical evening that we’ll never forget. Besides the event itself, we also really enjoyed working with the staff at the Aquarium, in particular Amanda and Alex. They were extremely supportive, responsive via email, and made us feel so at ease. I frantically emailed Alex one Friday afternoon and she responded almost immediately, and even offered to jump on the phone to talk something through. Overall, we loved our wedding at the aquarium. We are so happy that we chose it. The location/venue was awesome, the food was excellent, the staff were amazing. Thank you Alex and Amanda for the event of a lifetime.

This venue is absolutely fantastic, we loved it, our guests loved it, if you want a castle wedding, this is the place. We had a fantasy/D&D themed wedding and knew we wanted to get married in a castle (plus we're also in the history/museum field so getting married in a museum fit us). We had the ceremony on the back lawn overlooking the ocean and then had the reception in the great hall (45 guests). Deb (the venue coordinator) is great and seemed to work really well with our wedding planner. Hammond Castle is an active museum, so if you're thinking about using them as a wedding venue you need to go into it with the knowledge that you must be respectful of their operating hours and your allotted time--this is especially important when choosing and coordinating your vendors (particularly when scheduling drop-offs and pickups for equipment). The castle was also constructed in the 1920s and has some steep stairs so if you have elderly guests or people with mobility issues be mindful that they will likely need some assistance getting around.

We got married at Heritage Museums & Gardens in August 2025, and we seriously could not have picked a better place. The staff was so kind, helpful, and accommodating. They made everything feel easy, which is all you can ask for on a wedding day. And the venue… wow. The gardens were absolutely gorgeous, and every spot looked like it belonged in a postcard. Our photos are incredible because the whole place is just naturally beautiful. Our day went smoothly, we felt taken care of, and our guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning everything was.

deCordova was a phenomenal venue. We could not have been happier with our decision. From the ceremony terrace view to the layout and flow of the evening, our friends have been raving how much fun they had. Guests were able to come early and stroll the grounds and while we lucked out with the weather, it was such a relief to know we had a full backup plan if it rained. The planning process was thorough and smooth. Can’t express how grateful we were to work with Tori. From the first meeting until we walked into the tent, she was incredibly supportive, calm and on top of every detail. She was prepared for everything and was also so fun to have around. The staff were great and made the whole day run smoothly. Cost was clear from the start, and it was worth it - we did not have a separate coordinator and pretty much everything was included (with the exception of reception chairs and special tables). Coordination between the venue and other vendors was seamless and they worked great with our caterer (Fireside) to make sure everything was covered. We can’t wait to come back and stroll the grounds to celebrate our anniversary.

To say we are happy that we chose the RAA is an understatement. We'd stopped in to the gallery a few years ago when we visited Rockport on a whim and really loved it. I was thrilled when I found out they do weddings! The entire staff was very responsive and easy to work with. Their preferred vendors for food were excellent choices (we went with Vinwood), and I felt so good to be celebrating among beautiful artwork! We did some decorations but didn't want to detract from the art on the walls, which was perfect. The piano in the gallery was amazing for our ceremony, and the town of Rockport was just a wonderful setting. We have heard such nice things about the RAA from our guests, too. And it was affordable compared to other venues. It really fit our style. We had a little under 100 guests and had plenty of room for dinner and dancing, though more than that would be tight. Parking was a little fretful but once we realized there was an issue it seemed to resolve pretty fast...we still started on time with a full house! Thank you to the volunteers and to Robin and Kayla for helping us with our very important day!
