Samantha Iacia has been writing about weddings since 2013, beginning with a weekly wedding column for her hometown newspaper. She specializes in bridal fashion and jewelry, wedding decor, wedding flowers, and all things aesthetic. As the WeddingWire Editor, she can be found bookmarking new wedding trends, helping out on set at a photo shoot, or working on the team’s Digital Editorial Style Guide. Twice a year, she attends and reports on New York Bridal Fashion Week. Originally from Catonsville, Maryland, Samantha now lives in Washington, D.C., where you’ll usually catch her on her way to get a chai latte, rewatching Harry Potter for the zillionth time, or looking at pictures of other people’s cats. 

## Experience

In her seven years at WeddingWire, Samantha has written hundreds of articles, served as a stylist on multiple photo and video shoots, and managed the team’s real wedding features. Previously, Samantha spent two years as a lifestyle and features contributor for Baltimore Sun Media. In addition to writing a weekly real weddings column for _The Baltimore Sun_ , she covered Charm City’s local shopping scene, pulled products for fashion and home decor magazine photo shoots, and occasionally worked out with local retiree fitness groups—all in the name of journalism. 

Samantha has also written for Johns Hopkins University and _Baltimore_ magazine, where she reported on food and nightlife news as an intern in college. She started her writing career as an editorial intern at the now-folded _Chesapeake Home + Living_ magazine, where she did everything from blogging and curating Pinterest boards to choosing stylish dog beds for a holiday gift guide, steaming clothes for photo shoots, and dressing models on set. 

## Education

Samantha attended Towson University in Baltimore, Maryland, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mass Communication/Media Studies–Journalism and a minor in English Literature. During her time at Towson, she spent a semester as an exchange student at Leeds Beckett University in Leeds, England, where she studied digital journalism.

## WeddingWire Q&A with Samantha

### What is your ideal wedding style?

Flowers. Flowers everywhere, specifically garden roses, because they’re my favorite and looking at them brings me so much joy. My ideal wedding style is a combination of Old World romance balanced with a touch of elegant bohemian—mismatched chinoiserie, brass candlesticks, big wooden farmhouse tables. And couples’ portraits during golden hour will be non-negotiable. 

### Dream honeymoon location?

When I studied abroad, I fell in love with the English countryside (and still dream about it almost daily). It’s so picturesque, and the tiny villages and hamlets across the country are almost too charming. If not England, I’d go to southern Italy where I have family roots and spend the honeymoon drinking wine and eating pizza every day. 

### What would be your first dance song?

“Oh What A World” by Kasey Musgraves 

### Favorite celebrity wedding look?

There are a lot. Currently, I'm loving the dress that actress Ashley Greene wore for her wedding ceremony in 2018—it's a gorgeous fitted gown by Katie May with a scoop cowl neckline, plunging back, and just a hint of lace. I think it's the perfect combination of sexy and classy.
