Best photographer ever- traveled 2.5 hours to help us out last minute. He's very talented with editing and making sure you're captured in the best light possible and makes sure to capture every key moment and random ones you wouldn't expect. Everything turned out beautiful.

We booked Derrick for our engagement photos as he was recommended by a friend, and he did such an amazing job- we asked him to be our wedding photographer! Derrick is a great communicator by phone, text and email- whatever your preference is. His rates cannot be beat. He is super patient and willing to go the extra mile. For example, our wedding timeline was affected by unexpected traffic. The groom and groomsmen were super late! Derrick was able to shift the photo schedule and do a bunch of still photos and pictures of me (the bride) and my bridesmaids. Although he arrived at the venue early to scope it all out and to make a plan for photos, the delay resulted in a lower sun and that affected everything. He was quick to form a new plan and worked with the changing circumstances. He let us be ourselves and also had some direction for us and the group as well. We had sneak peek photos available the next day and had all our photos within 20 days!!!! I have never heard of anyone getting their photos back so quickly. All of our photos are available on a website which our guests can access as well. They’re easily downloaded and great quality. He has offered to change anything to black and white or whatever edits we want, but I find his work to be perfect on its own. Derrick is easy to work with. He was moving around the venue throughout the evening and was available for any picture I requested with my guests and family. It was a long day and he never complained. His fees are extremely reasonable and transparent. I would happily recommend him for any occasion, including a wedding.

Choosing Crop It Like It's Hot to photograph our vow renewal was one of the best decisions we’ve ever made. From the moment they arrived, the team brought such a calm, joyful energy. They made us feel relaxed and truly seen, taking time to understand what the day meant to us. Every photo reflects that intention—every smile, tear, and quiet in-between moment was preserved so beautifully. Looking through the gallery feels like reliving the entire celebration. The images are full of emotion, beautifully composed, and so true to who we are. Crop It Like It's Hot didn’t just take pictures—they told our story in the most unforgettable way. If you're celebrating love in any form, Crop It Like It's Hot is who you want by your side. They are true professionals, gifted artists, and just wonderful humans to work with. We’re beyond grateful.

Josh & Amanda were our photographers for our wedding and I could not be happier with our decision to go with them! They are quick to respond, warm, welcoming, and extremely talented. They are so skilled at using natural light in their photography and created unique shots that we love. All of the pictures are beautiful and turned out better than we could have imagined, it's so hard to pick favorites! Josh & Amanda were professional, on time, and prepared the day of our wedding. They photographed for us for ~11 hours. They were very welcoming to our idea of us wanting to recreate some shots from inspiration pictures. They also have a very helpful wedding guide available on their website. You can tell this is their passion and they help make you feel comfortable in front of the camera. We can't recommend them enough and can't wait to hire them for future family photos!

Heather was an absolute dream to work with! She made us feel so at ease, like we were just enjoying a moment together rather than posing for photos. Her energy was uplifting, and she knew exactly how to capture our personalities in the most natural way. The entire session felt effortless, and the final images were beyond stunning. We will cherish them forever!

Megan was phenomenal! My husband and I were married in March, and we were so thankful to have chosen Megan. Not only was her work brilliant but she was exceptionally organized and helped us immensely with our schedule. She prompted questions we didn't think to ask. Megan worked seamlessly alongside our DJ and ceremony coordinator. It was as if she was part of our wedding party. We felt peaceful the entire day, and her calming presence was a major factor in that. You will not regret booking her for your special day!

Adam was great to work with and professional. He always maintained a friendly attitude despite my millions of questions and requests. His daughter was the second shooter the day of the wedding and both were great to work with. I was waiting to write the review until after we received the photo album and it was phenomenal. Highly recommend Adam!

My husband and I got married in Gatlinburg on Dec. 14th. Cayla was amazing. From the beginning of our planning the wedding back in the Spring, she was very accommodating to app the changes I wanted to do, as well as also having great ideas! The day of the wedding she was highly professional and so easy to work with. I would definitely recommend her for anyone that is looking to have a fun, stress-free, unique and professional photographer who makes you feel amazing on your big day!!

Rustic weddings in Lexington are incredibly romantic and memorable. Capture every moment of your Big Day with help from a talented Lexington wedding photographer. Not sure what to look for when choosing someone to hire? Keep reading – we’ve got the tips you need to ensure you’re betting on the right horse.

## Hiring a Wedding Photographer in Lexington

There’s no better way to start hunting for a Lexington wedding photographer than to browse through online portfolio websites. Even if you know very little about the art of photography, looking through these sites will give you insight into the things you prefer and the things you don’t. Bookmark favorite shots and bring them along when you meet with potential candidates in person. Even if you can’t verbalize exactly what you love about the composition and lighting of the photo, great photographers will be able to hone in on the vibe you like best.

Remember, keep your wedding budget in mind as you browse. You want to find the very best photographer in your price range, not get your hopes up over a service you might not be able to afford. Couples typically set aside ten percent of their wedding budget for the photographer of their choice.

Once you’ve met with a few photographers, consider each person’s level of professionalism, expertise and experience. Generally, finding a wedding photographer is kind of like falling in love: when you know, you just know. Of course, with so many talented wedding photographers in Lexington, odds are good that you’re hiring someone amazing.

## Picturesque Lexington Spots for Photo Shoots

Outdoorsy couples will jump at the chance to pose on scenic bridges overlooking the Kentucky River. Jacobson Park is also quite charming, with colorful maple trees and gorgeous views of the sunset.

Couples looking for a more urban setting for their photos won’t have to look hard for beautiful spots downtown. Brightly colored street art provides a unique backdrop for couples posing outside the Bar Complex. For more traditional wedding photo scenery, head inside one of the many local historic homes to take advantage of Lexington’s gorgeous architecture.

## Weather Forecast for Lexington’s Wedding Season

Choosing a[ wedding date](https://go.weddingwire.com/wedding-date) with weather in mind for gorgeous photos is easy in this part of Kentucky. Lexington’s mild climate means wedding season here can last from April through October. Most folks in Lexington tie the knot at the end of spring and into the early summer months, when humidity levels are still fairly low. No matter when you decide to get married, consult with your photographer about any concerns you might have about the forecast. Seasoned professionals will have tips and tricks up their sleeves ready for any kind of weather. Some will even tell you that a cloudy sky is preferred over a clear blue one.

Once you’ve chosen your ideal Lexington wedding photographer, check it off your[ WeddingWire wedding planning checklist.](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-checklists.html) It’s a satisfying feeling that can help you keep up momentum throughout the entire planning process.
