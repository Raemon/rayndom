We had an amazing experience working with Event Rent for our wedding rentals, and we couldn’t be happier with their service. We rented chairs, linens, plates, glassware, a stage, and a dance floor, and everything arrived in perfect condition, adding an elegant touch to our special day. The quality of the items was outstanding, and their team was professional, responsive, and incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. From the seamless logistics of delivery and pickup to their attention to detail in accommodating our requests, Event Rent made everything stress-free and effortless. Their exceptional service and beautiful rentals truly elevated our wedding, and we highly recommend them to anyone planning an event!

Oh my gosh I wish I could take Grant home with me!!!! His business is so amazing and he's the nicest guy!!!!! We had his SUPER affordable photo booth at our wedding reception, and it was a huge hit! He has every prop you can think of (and even puts some of them away when children are present ;) ). He even gives you a souvenir guest book. The guests get an extra copy of the strip and put it in the book, and write something to the bride and groom! Favorite part of my wedding, for sure!!!!!!!!!

We used Signature for our wedding and they made it so easy for us to rent everything only from them. They have a ton of options and if you ever have questions you can call them up and they guide you through crafting a personalized order for you. Lots of times it's cheaper to buy instead of rent for weddings, but not with Signature. They were so affordable that it made way more sense to rent. 10/10 recommend!

I rented some decor from them because it was so much cheaper than buying and saved me from having so much extra things to try to get rid of after the wedding. They’re super affordable compared to other companies in the area and they were so helpful. They called to confirm a week before, what I had ordered and when we’d be picking up and when you have “bride brain” you’re so grateful for the extra reminder and care.

I have had the pleasure of working with Jenny on a few different events over the years. She is always such a pleasure to work with. She is kind, professional, and punctual every single time. She has absolutely stunning decor, and a keen eye for design. If you are looking to add, a serious sense of style and uniqueness to event look no further than rustique rentals! I highly recommend adding their decor and rental items to elevate your event!
