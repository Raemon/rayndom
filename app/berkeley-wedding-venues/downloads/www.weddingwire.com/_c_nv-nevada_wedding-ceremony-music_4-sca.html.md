My husband and i are so happy we went with live music for our ceremony. We had so much positive comments from our guest on how lovely it was to be able to hear music while waiting. Also for the wedding party to walk to. Peter is an amazing addition to any event and i was beyond blown away by this artist. We recommend for any wedding or event! Thank you Peter.

The addition of this service elevated our wedding so much. From the beginning of their service to the very end of it they were extremely accommodating and supportive.

We had Felicia recomended by a friend who also had her as a violinist at his wedding . Our wedding was in Hawaii and she did such a wonderful job and played so beautiful. Our guests had tears in their eyes when she played for our first dance as husband and wife. we choose our favorite songs and she played them. she is also very punctual and organised and did everything by herself so we can have one less thing to do and enjoy our wedding day. She collaborated flawlesly with our DJ about the music and all the tehnical part and everything went perfect. She also had our favorite songs recorded and she gifted us the music so we can have it for the rest of our lives and enjoy it whenever we want to remember the beautiful music she played. Wait until you hear her live , she is amazing.

We hired a solo cellist for our ceremony and cocktail hour. Zuzanna was responsive and easy to work with. She asked about our colors and coordinated our cellist's dress to match the arch. Hannah was our cellist for the day and the music was superb! We had picked a few songs from their list and then asked for an arrangement of one song they didn't already offer. She nailed everything. So professional. Guests commented on how beautiful the music was. The price was super reasonable. Would highly recommend!

This band was the best. My friends keep telling me that out of all of the wedding bands they've heard, mine was by far the best. Harbor Lights totally rocked my wedding.

Chandler Judkins was great to work with very responsive and professional. The string quartet was a beautiful part of our ceremony and made everything that much more perfect. They were on time and played beautifully.

If you’re thinking about having instrumentals involved in your big day, look no further. Cynthia was communicative, organized, and as excited as I was. Prior to the big day we had an couple of meetings to figure out the procession and flow of the wedding and decided on the music, Cynthia and her team brought to life the range of music I requested (Elvis, Taylor swift, Billy Joel). It was so customized and I truly felt like she invested as if it were a special day for her as well. So many of my guests commented on how beautiful and how well the music flowed. Would 100000% recommend.

Thank you Kim for your amazing musical accompaniment for out outdoor wedding and for working with us when our previous musician had to back out. Our guests raved about Kim. She is so talented and did a great mix of new and classic songs and honored our requests.
