The Mirror Mirror Co., based in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and Nashville, offers beautiful invitations and paper goods to couples celebrating their wedding. We're here for the stories that make life joyful, and we believe your wedding should feel unapologetically, authentically you.

The Mirror Mirror Co. specializes in custom wedding design from planning to finish, including invitations, save-the-dates, day-of signage, menus, place cards, and complete event design from concept to installation. We also help with vendor sourcing to connect you with trusted partners who share our commitment to quality. We're not wedding planners – we're your design team focused on creating the visual story of your celebration and serving couples in Atlanta, Orange County, and Nashville or remotely who want their weddings to reflect their unique personalities – not a Pinterest board.

**What makes us different?**

We don't just do one piece of the design, we do the whole process. We make sure your save-the-dates match your invitations, and the menus, signage, and small details on the big day. We're proudly AI-free (because authentic connections create authentic design), committed to sustainable materials, and genuinely excited about celebrating all love stories. Whether you're maximalist souls who want ALL the details or minimalist hearts who believe less is more, we create custom designs that are entirely, unmistakably yours.*

From your first consultation to installation day, we're the team that gets why that specific color matters, who understands your vision even when you're still figuring it out, and who makes the design process fun instead of stressful. We're LGBTQ+ inclusive, sustainably minded, and support small businesses every step of the way.

No cookie-cutter templates. No generic designs. Just beautiful, bespoke celebration details that tell your story and leave your guests saying "that was SO them." Because at the end of the day, joy is the whole point.

_*Note: Because production costs can vary due to paper, production method (letterpress/digital/custom hand pieces), or any rush delivery fees, we charge this separately. The costs will always be reviewed and approved prior to production, so there are never any surprises._

The Love Is In The Details

Mirror Mirror is right — their BEAUTIFUL work is such a true reflection of everything we had dreamed for our wedding day and more! I had some very grand, Pinterest-inspired ideas that I did not think we could make real and Donnine totally made it happen in a way that felt special like the inspiration but also authentic to us and (very important, wedding planning folks know) WITHIN OUR BUDGET! Before working with Mirror Mirror we had some roughly connected pieces and it’s truly night and day now of how unified the look and feel for our whole day feels. It truly does all work together to tell a story. The magic is in the details and they have all been executed perfectly! It has been such a treat to get to work with Donnine on bringing this to life and it took something I felt unsure about to one of the most exciting pieces of our day. I can’t thank her enough!!   
  
Donnine was so helpful in working with print vendors to answer tons of questions that were totally foreign. She took care of everything, from gathering print quotes to setting up print sizes, and more!   
  
I started working with Mirror Mirror after I already had a vision in mind. Donnine was so respectful and open to what I was dreaming of while also evolving and elevating it to a level I didn’t know we could reach. She knew what I was picturing before I even did!
