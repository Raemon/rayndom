Oh my god the food at my wedding was to die for :). I couldn't be any more happy with the service and friendship I received from them. Her team was able to create my perfect wedding with the instruction giving to them for the decoration. And my guest can't stop talking about the food, I even went pack for seconds. i am a control freak and I was at rest the whole day knowing Alena was handling everything from the decorations, cooking, to the serving. She was well prepared, very professional and can cook amazing food. Thank you Alena for making my day run smoothly it was amazing. ?

If you are looking for good food, professional service, budget friendly, and amazing people, look no further! First off their prices can't be beat, the fact that they include plates and cutlery, and rent out linens and napkins at such a low price, there is no other company that gave me the deal that Christie's catering did. Teanna is very quick to respond to inquiries and provide information. We got set-up with an in-person tasting and we were instantly sold. Teanna and her Husband Mitch (also bartender) were so kind, so much fun to work with from the start till the end. They made me feel at ease knowing that everything would be perfect. Day of they set-up everything so nicely and everything looked great, the buffet food was great (we had A LOT of leftovers, and they put them all in containers for us). The bar tending services were great, everything till the end was so wonderful. Mitch and his staff stayed and helped and everyone was so nice, our guests loved them too! Mitch even put my plate together for dinner since he saw how busy I was and then check in on me to make sure if I needed anything else. Teanna also saved the day by having 2 extra gold charges that were exactly the same as mine and she let us use them since we were short by 2 - totally saved us! Quality food, easy to communicate with, very customizable menu, professional, and affordable. Look no further, support this amazing family owned business and hire them, trust me!

My husband and I had the unfortunate circumstance of our caterers canceling a mere 3 weeks before our destination wedding in Washington. Carr's Restaurant & Catering to the rescue and managed to provide us with their amazing services in an incredibly short timeframe. They worked with us on our menu and we had a stellar selection to provide our guests: 3 appetizers, a seafood and beef main, and some truly amazing side dishes. We received so many compliments from our guests about the magnificent quality of food, and everyone was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. We had a small leftover amount of salmon, which I was very excited about, the rest, however, was positively devoured by our guests. Even with the travel and stipend for staff and bartenders in conjunction with food, dishes, utensils and place-ware, the price was incredibly competitive with most all other catering company quotes! I simply couldn’t be happier with the catering services provided by Carr's restaurant & Catering for our wedding and I would highly recommend them to everyone wishing for an amazing meal with even more amazing staff.

On Safari Foods catered our July 2023 wedding, and we were SO happy with both the food and service. Elizabeth was a pleasure to work with and was very responsive in the weeks leading up to our wedding, and the day of team was incredibly friendly and helpful. The food was delicious - we had several guests tell us it was the best wedding food they've ever had! A huge thank you to the On Safari Foods team. I highly recommend them as a wedding caterer!

We can’t recommend Blue Ribbon enough. They made our day absolutely perfect. When we first started planning our wedding we actually didn’t intend on having professional catering or having a planner/day of coordinator because we thought it wouldn’t be necessary, but I am so incredibly glad that we ended up going with blue ribbon. It was absolutely well worth the money and made our day feel so complete and special. We worked with David as our planner and coordinator and we can’t say enough kind things about him. He was such a joy to work with and made our day so above and beyond what we expected and had hoped for. Leading up to the wedding we had several meetings in person and online with David and he did such an amazing job of easing any anxiety we had about the day and guiding us in the direction we needed to go in. He understood the vibe and essence of the day that we were looking for and ran with it. Once we got to the actual day and we got to see everything set up and all of the amazing work that the entire blue ribbon team did (from florals to decor to the food and dessert) it was all so beautiful and perfect. The staff at the event were all so kind and helpful, David always made sure we had everything that we needed, and just made it the most magical day. They made everything so so easy for us and it was truly so worth the cost. highly highly highly recommend

Ben, Pedro and Kristine, I want to say a Big thank you for catering our wedding reception last weekend. All the guests said the food was delicious and we all enjoyed it. Thank you Pedro for thinking about every single detail and making sure my expectations were met. Seriously, you even called me a few days before, to make sure the ordered glasses are the right shape. Thanks Kristine for taking your time to stop by the venue ahead of time and come up with the plan where to place the food table etc. You did the best job leading the catering event and I appreciate you taking care of myself and Brian during the reception. The whole experience working with you guys was top notch! Ben, you've built a great team!

We had 'A Catered Affair' cater our wedding, and they were amazing from start to finish. The pasta and salads were so fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Everything was seamless, professional, and stress-free, which meant the world to us on such a big day. Chelsea worked with me to make sure everything was exactly how I envisioned it! Highly recommend them for any event!

Act3 helped make our most special day absolutely perfect! Working with Act3 was the easiest process from submitting an inquiry to wedding clean up. Their whole team made us feel so special and allowed us to fully soak in our entire wedding day. And beyond the amazing service we received, we also still have family and friends talking about the most delicious food. #MyACT3Wedding We refer Act3 to all of our friends and keep looking for opportunities to work with them again!

We had the best food and service at our wedding thanks to Twelve Baskets! We looked at multiple caterers for our wedding, but what ultimately won us over was the great interactions we had at our tasting getting to meet the chef and coordinators. We knew we had a great team supporting us, and the food was in a different galaxy compared to the standard wedding fare. Working with Vita and Brett was great, and we didn't make it easy on them with many changes to our guest count, menu, dietary restrictions and more. If you need a caterer we highly recommend Twelve Baskets!

We had an amazing experience with our wedding caterer from start to finish. The food tasting was incredible, and when my parents couldn’t make it, the team was kind enough to box up food for us to take home to them—such a thoughtful touch that meant a lot to us. The staff was always so friendly and quick to answer any questions, which made the planning process easy and stress-free. On the day of the wedding, they went above and beyond. The manager personally brought us our dinner and even started us off with two drinks each, which was such a nice gesture and really helped us relax and enjoy the moment. The bartenders were friendly, funny, and a huge hit with our guests—everyone loved them. Even now, people are still talking about how great the food was. We couldn’t recommend this catering team more!
