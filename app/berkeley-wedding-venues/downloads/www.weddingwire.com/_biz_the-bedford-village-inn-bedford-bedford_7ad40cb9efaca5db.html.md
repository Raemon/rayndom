The venue that has it ALL

We fell in love with this venue before we even stepped foot on the property. The charming colonial facade of the buildings welcomes you inside. The stunning architecture of the great hall, meticulously landscaped gardens, and boho chic vibe of the Edison bulbs over the lawn comprise the perfect backdrop for a memorable ceremony and gorgeous pictures. Not to mention the food!! Wedding food usually isn’t very memorable, or if it is, it’s for the wrong reasons. The food was remarkable! Everyone raved about it for weeks. They are also so great about accommodating food allergies, which was great for several of our guests.   
  
The facilities were absolutely incredible. We were blown away by the service and care provided in the Grand. We received complimentary champagne upon check-in, polite and efficient service from the bellhop, and a complimentary room move of our belongings on the day of our wedding to the Inn. The modern yet cozy feel of the grand suites was absolutely amazing. We almost didn’t want to leave for the inn! The bed is so comfortable and the bathroom is luxurious. Once we moved over to the Inn, we appreciated the charming, antique touches throughout the room. The facilities were incredible–we loved the extra bathroom and plenty of space to spread out and also relax in between photos. The balconies make for great photo shoots and the walk in closet was greatly appreciated! We even received a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate cake! Worth every penny!!  
  
What was most memorable for us at BVI were the staff. From the moment we began planning our wedding with Olivia to the day of coordination with Brittany and even our personal attendant Griffin, we were completely blown away with the professionalism, graciousness, accommodation, and flexibility of every single person we came in contact with. Everyone worked so diligently to ensure that our day was absolutely perfect and it was!! The staff work so well together, like an oiled machine. Though it looked like it was going to rain, Brittany had her staff set up chairs outside and we were able to have our ceremony outside just in time to miss a passing shower. She had her phone opened to the weather radar for an hour to make our ceremony just as we had planned. Brittany was also incredible during the wedding, attending to anything we needed. Griffin, our personal attendant, was charming and funny. We so appreciated him! Leading up to our wedding, we had a lot of last minute guest list changes and Olivia was so flexible in providing us several solutions. Her affirmations, assurances, and optimistic demeanor were everything a couple needs leading up to their wedding. We can’t say enough good things about everyone who works at Bedford Village inn!  
  
Do not think twice about booking your wedding at BVI! It is worth every penny!!

The best of the BEST!!

We could not have been happier with every part of our experience with BVI! Madison was our Wedding Coordinator and was an absolute gem to work with. She is so organized, responsive, and personable—always answering our questions promptly and making sure we had everything we needed. She knows the wedding planning process inside and out and especially the venue itself, often providing amazing recommendations to ensure our ceremony and reception were perfect.  
  
The entire staff was so professional, constantly checking in throughout the day to make sure everything was to our liking and to see if we needed anything at all. Throughout the night, there wasn’t a single moment when our glasses were empty—they made sure we could relax and enjoy every second.  
  
The venue itself is beyond stunning, requiring very little decoration because the space speaks for itself. The ceremony courtyard comfortably fit our 120 guests, creating an intimate experience surrounded by gorgeous flowers and greenery. The balcony overlooking the ceremony space allowed our DJ to seamlessly coordinate everything without distraction.  
  
The reception space was lovely, with high ceilings and exposed wood creating a rustic yet modern feel. It felt intimate without ever feeling crowded, with plenty of room for a dance floor that stayed packed all night long. The cocktail hour and food were unforgettable—every guest raved about how delicious everything was! There were so many options to choose from, and the staff made sure each station stayed fully stocked while hors d'oeuvres were continuously passed.  
  
The rehearsal dinner and morning-after brunch were also phenomenal, with the staff taking care of every single detail. One of the best parts about BVI is that EVERYTHING can be done on-site, and they are so accommodating. No shuttles, no wasted time—you can move seamlessly from one part of the celebration to the next. For guests traveling from out of town, it was especially convenient knowing they could simply walk downstairs or across the lot to attend.  
  
From the very first visit to the final moment of our wedding day, BVI and Madison made sure every single detail was accounted for and gave us the wedding of our dreams. Thank you for making our day absolutely perfect. Choose the Bedford Village Inn—you will not regret it!!

A Dream Come True – The Perfect Venue with an Incredible Team

From the very beginning, working with BVI was an absolute dream—and a huge part of that was thanks to our incredible coordinator, Madison. Her attention to detail, calm professionalism, and genuine warmth made the entire planning process feel effortless. She was always patient, organized, and responsive, and I can honestly say that our wedding day was as perfect as it was because of her and the amazing team at BVI.  
  
Every detail—from the ceremony setup to the reception flow—was handled with such care and precision. The entire day unfolded so smoothly, and it was clear how much thought and experience went into every moment. I was able to truly relax and enjoy the day knowing everything was in such capable hands.  
  
The venue itself is stunning, and so many of our guests have told us how beautiful everything looked and how well-run the entire event was. From start to finish, it was more than we ever could have hoped for—elegant, seamless, and full of joy. It felt like a true fairytale, and we owe so much of that to BVI.  
  
We are beyond grateful to Madison and the whole team for making our wedding day so special. I can’t recommend them highly enough—if you’re considering BVI for your wedding, just say yes. You’ll be in the very best hands.

Dream Winter Wedding 

My husband and I, along with our guests, cannot say enough great things about the BVI! This place holds a special place in our hearts as we’ve been frequent guests of the Christmas Eve dinner, so when it came to choosing a venue for our wedding, the BVI was already high on our list. That feeling was elevated from the get-go when we met with Madison for the first time for a tour. We both left after this meeting knowing that this was our top choice and after the whole process, we would get married here again and again! Madison was on top of things every time we talked to her, answering all of our questions, no matter how silly or small. One perk we took advantage of was the Styled by BVI option, which was wonderful! Melissa was so easy to work with, and the decor was truly a dream! The day of the wedding was perfection! Madison was amazing, making sure everything went exactly as we wished. It could not have been smoother! And everyone on the staff was incredible! Allyson was amazing handling all our hotel questions and concerns quickly and with care, and the rooms are incredible! Nikol was stellar! She made sure my husband and I had everything we needed-food, a drink, a dress fix…you name it, she was there! And Gillian was wonderful for making sure that everything was squared away, and we didn’t have to think about a thing with the end of the night process! I apologize for the lengthy review, but I could not say enough good things about this place! We knew we would have a great experience here and that we were in good hands from the beginning, but truly, they exceeded our expectations in every way!! Thank you Madison and all for making our dream wedding a reality!

Beautiful venue!

We got married in the Charolais Room at The Grand. This place is magical. We could not be happier with it as our wedding venue. It was beautiful. The hotel is gorgeous, our suite was incredible and the perfect place to get ready. The food was delicious and plenty of it. The staff are INCREDIBLE. Our coordinator, Olivia, is the best. She is kind, responsive, and helpful. She heard all of our asks and made them come to life. She has an amazing eye for decor and added lovely touches. She’s incredibly organized and we did not have to worry about a single thing with her as our coordinator. Gillian, our bridal attendant, was awesome. She always made sure we had everything we needed. She took care of us and we were never thirsty or hungry all night. Nicole was our day of coordinator, and met all of our needs. She was super helpful with managing in-the-moment tasks and taking care of us. It was truly the best day of our life and the venue/staff helped make the day even more special. Highly recommend this venue!

The best decision ever!

BVI was the best decision we had made for our wedding. They were fantastic. Every detail was thought of on BVI's side. They were fantastic to our family. Our family and friends said it was some of the best food they had and the best hotel stay for a wedding they have had. The food was delicious including the appetizers. The coordinator, Madison, is the BEST to work with. She really guides you and helps you. I couldn't have done it without her. The two day of coordinators, Paige & Nicole, were also amazing. We also had rehearsal dinner in the Overlook room. They did a fantastic job. Food was great!! I could write a book on how awesome BVI and their employees are. Don't hesitate to book here! You

The absolute best decision for our venue!

Bedford Village Inn (BVI) exceeded all expectations for every element of our wedding, and this is not hyperbole. We thought the pricing would be out of reach for us and almost didn’t even get a quote, boy are we glad we did because for our small wedding, they actually had the BEST price of the dozens of venues we had reached out to in New England.  
  
We wanted a venue that could host the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception, as well as provide overnight accommodations for our mostly out of town guests. Additional criteria were that the food had to be top notch, and we were looking for an easy, but elevated aesthetic. BVI met all of these requirements and then some.  
  
Since our total guest count was less than 40, we were in the Charlois Room at the Grand and it was the PERFECT size for our small wedding. It never felt awkwardly too big, nor cramped, and we got to have the traditional wedding experience we were looking for with a full reception and cocktail hour.  
  
As if all of the above weren’t enough, what really makes the BVI experience outstanding is the incredibly amazing, kind, attentive, and welcoming staff. When we met with our coordinator we knew we were in good hands, and that was just the tip of the iceberg. The entire planning experience was so special and easy with everyone we worked with. A special shout out to Madison M. for being so supportive, responsive, and sweet! Madison was an absolute pleasure to work with! Many of our guests commented on how impressed they were with both the service and the food. One waitress was dancing with the kids in attendance at the wedding, keeping them entertained and giving their parents a break.   
  
BVI will now always hold a special place in our hearts, they made our wedding dreams come true! It was a perfect day at the perfect venue and we couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out.

Overall great place 

Had our wedding here on a Monday. The venue was amazing and staff great. Everyone was very friendly and assisted when needed. They made sure everything was setup for the ceremony and dinner. At the after dinner the wait staff was great. Both Ashley and Jacob were extremely outgoing and helpful. Jacob especially was friendly and was a pleasure to deal with. He acted more as a friend than just a server. Overall experience was great and will definitely recommend and return for dinners.

I couldn't imagine my wedding anywhere else

I don't think I could accurately put how much I loved working with BVI into words. The entire team was just incredible, always on top of everything, and made sure the day was absolutely perfect. Madison was our coordinator and she is easily one of the best in the business. She was so responsive whenever I had a question during the planning stages and wasn't afraid to be honest, which I highly appreciated. I also worked with Allyson on the lodging side for booking the rooms and anything hotel related. Again, incredibly responsive and helpful during the planning stages. Her and her team were there whenever someone needed help for their reservation and it made the entire process so easy. Every single team member at BVi made the wedding the best wedding it could possible be. The food is absolutely delicious. The venue is beautiful. You can rent decor. And the day of the wedding there were so many little touches that BVI did to make it feel as special and personalized as possible. I cannot recommend BVI more and this place will always hold such an incredible spot in my heart. Thank you thank you thank you
