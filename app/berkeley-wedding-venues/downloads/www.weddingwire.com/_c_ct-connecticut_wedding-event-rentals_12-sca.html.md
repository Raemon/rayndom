Taylor Rental was great. They did a site visit and helped me determine what I realistically needed for my wedding without trying to sell me on extras. Rented a tent in case of rain and fortunately the weather was perfect, but the tent was great anyway for a break from the sun. Would definitely use them again.

Choosing Meriden Party Rentals was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. Planning a wedding can be overwhelming especially when you’re short on time, but Carlos and his team made everything feel effortless from day one. We rented tables, chairs, concession stands, yard games, string lights, a dance floor, and even luxury porta potties, and every single item was beautiful, clean, and exactly what we envisioned. I have to specifically mention the luxury restrooms… they were hands down the cleanest porta potties I have ever seen. Our guests were genuinely impressed, and that says a lot! Meriden Party Rentals is truly a one-stop shop. They have everything you could possibly need for a wedding or special event. What truly stood out to me was the communication. Carlos was always responsive, clear, and incredibly reassuring throughout the entire process. Every question was answered quickly, every detail was confirmed, and I always felt confident that we were in great hands. For a small additional fee, Carlos and his team handled the full setup, and walking into our venue and seeing everything perfectly arranged was incredibly emotional. It took such a huge weight off my shoulders and allowed us to fully enjoy our day without stress or last-minute worries which is something every bride deserves. Carlos is professional, kind, and genuinely cares about making your event special. If you are a bride looking for a dependable, organized, and thoughtful wedding rental company, I cannot recommend Meriden Party Rentals enough. They exceeded our expectations in every way and helped make our wedding day unforgettable.

These lavatory units are the cleanest I’ve seen and always filled with abundant amenities. Truly are luxurious lavatories. Used this company a few times now and would not look anywhere else again. Very helpful and friendly staff.

We hired White Glove Restrooms for our backyard outdoor wedding, and they were excellent to work with. They delivered the restrooms a couple of days before the wedding and handled all the setup for us. Guests were very impressed with the cleanliness of the restrooms, and they even provided some toiletries for our guests to use. We would definitely recommend them!

This was our second year in a row using The Good Life and I cannot recommend them highly enough. They are always on time, efficient with set up and super helpful with placement and educating us on how to operate the generator and use the potties. The bathrooms are beautiful. They really are. Every year we have guests taking pictures of the bathrooms. The bathrooms are always clean and well stocked. We plan to use The Good Life for our party again this year. A+ from our school!

Taylor Rental was more than amazing. They were so easy to work with and were very efficient. Set up and take down was seamless and their products have great quality. I'd highly recommend them!

Our venue was completely à la carte, which meant we had to rent absolutely everything — and we truly could not have done it without Tents Unlimited. From start to finish, Brittany and Frank were an absolute dream to work with. They were incredibly responsive, patient, and detail-oriented, working through so many rounds of revisions with us to nail down the perfect floor plan and layout. When we hit a last-minute snag with our catering team, they swooped in like total heroes and provided linens for us at the eleventh hour — saving the day without hesitation. That level of dedication and professionalism is so rare and so appreciated. Everything they provided was beautiful, high quality, and exactly what we envisioned. We’re beyond grateful for their partnership and can’t recommend Tents Unlimited highly enough. If you want a stress-free, top-notch experience for your wedding or event, look no further. These are the people you want on your team!
