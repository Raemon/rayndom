Five-Star Service / All-Inclusive Event

If you're looking for a regal wedding / reception space with top-notch service, hotel and restaurants on site, definitely consider Saint John's Resort in Plymouth. The staff, service and amenities are unmatched. Our guests raved about everything: hotel accommodations, on-site restaurants, the Chapel, appetizer, plated dinner, bar offerings and overall service and ambiance. The Presidential Suite was the perfect getting ready space for the entire bridal party the morning of the big day.

The Most Magical Day

Saint John's Resort is the most magical place to get married in December. The holiday decorations were absolutely gorgeous and made for some great pictures. Our wedding day was smooth and any minor problems that came up were taken care of quickly by the staff. The convenience of having the chapel, reception room, and hotel all in the same building was priceless for both my husband and I, and the wedding guests. Christine was consistent and super helpful throughout the entire process from touring the venue, all the way to the wedding day.

Best Reception Venue

We could not have imagined a better wedding day than we had. It was seriously a fairytale wedding. We had our reception in the atrium. Everything was set up flawlessly. The service was amazing. The people who work here are so attentive. They offered to take our dinner and save it for us under a warmer and deliver it to our room after the night was over because we never sat down! We worked with Manda Lawson who was there with us every step of the way. I cannot recommend her more! She made everything so easy! We also worked with Lindsay Omelia and Emily Monti who were both amazing as well. Thank you so much for making our day perfect and so so brautiful!

Fairytale perfection

I found this venue with my daughter, for her 11.02.2019 wedding this past weekend. We met with Manda well over a year ago and she took care of us along the entire journey. We live in the area, so it was not a destination wedding for us, but we had many out of town guests. Fortunately, the guest rooms at The Inn were beautiful and plentiful and accommodated many of our guests.  
  
It was a weekend affair! Friday was the rehearsal in the amazingly beautiful European style chapel, followed by a great and delicious rehearsal dinner at 5ive Steakhouse. After that, we spilled out onto the main floor of 5ive to mingle with our other guests who had joined us for the welcome reception.   
  
Saturday, the couple was married in the chapel, followed by more partying at 5ive and then into the unbelievably gorgeous Atrium for cocktail hour and the reception. Absolutely stunning and perfect!  
  
Sunday, all of the guests who were still in town joined us for a send-off buffet breakfast. Again, absolutely beautiful, organized, well-run and perfect.  
  
So those are the details. This property is an amazing hidden gem. It has everything a couple might need for their wedding day/weekend. We had so many compliments from everyone, in and out of town!  
  
But it had to be more than the property itself to prompt me to leave this review. That’s where this highly trained staff enters the picture. They turned this beautiful, picturesque property into the fairytale wedding of my daughter’s and her husband’s dreams! Manda (sales manager) helped me take my and my daughter’s vision and turn it into reality. Manda worked tirelessly, patiently and thoroughly with me and everyone at St. John’s. Some of the other outstanding people we worked with were Kathy (chapel), Emily (The Inn), Lindsay (bookkeeping and someone to reach out to when Manda had a day off), Mistie (5ive), the banquet captain’s, servers, Connor (breakfast) and on and on. There were so many people who did their jobs flawlessly. I am sorry I cannot name them all and give them all the credit that they deserve, but without exception, they are a well-trained staff who does their job quietly and professionally. They are truly a service- and customer- oriented crew.  
  
I strongly recommend this venue, to anybody wishing for the royal treatment!

Easy to Work with, Beautiful Location!

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful! We held our ceremony and reception here. Everything was amazing, and super easy to plan. The folks here are true professionals- we didn’t feel the need for a wedding planner or day of coordinator because weddings are what they do, and they do it well. The food was absolutely incredible, and planning with Christine was a breeze and a delight. If you’re looking for stress free planning and an absolutely gorgeous location, this is your place! It’s definitely worth a look if you’re looking around- the intro info packet is super helpful, and there are tons of pictures online to help show what they transform the reception spaces into.
