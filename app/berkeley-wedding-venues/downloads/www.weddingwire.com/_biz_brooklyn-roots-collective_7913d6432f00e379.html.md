**Facilities & Capacity**

This sustainably restored former paper factory features soaring ceilings, natural light streaming through paned windows, and doors that open into a private outdoor sanctuary. Couples can exchange vows in the intimate garden, surrounded by lush greenery and upcycled structures. Inside, the expansive first-floor hall offers an open-plan layout for dinner, dancing, and live entertainment. Industrial-chic details, potted plants, and naturally sourced sustainable elements set a stylish backdrop, while a built-in stage can host bands, DJs, or performers. 

A mezzanine level adds depth and dimension, complete with a VIP bar and lounge seating. Guests can also enjoy the outdoor courtyard for fresh air and conversation throughout the festivities. With flexible indoor and outdoor settings, Brooklyn Roots Collective accommodates weddings of varying sizes and styles. We can easily accommodate **BIG** weddings—there’s no need to limit your guest list.

The dedicated events team is committed to delivering a seamless, personalized wedding experience. Brooklyn Roots Collective works with a curated network of chefs, preferred caterers, and food trucks, offering couples the opportunity to design a sustainable, seasonal menu without sacrificing flavor or creativity. Fresh herbs from the onsite farm are also incorporated into a signature farm-to-beverage program, ensuring cocktails and mocktails are infused with unique, garden-fresh elements.

The venue offers site visits and vendor coordination, with a preferred (but not exclusive) list of trusted professionals to help bring your vision to life.

Beautiful Venue with a Few Surprises

Recently, I attended an event at this vegan, eco-conscious venue, and it was nothing short of exceptional. The space itself is both modern and inviting, with thoughtful touches that reflect its commitment to sustainability. The courtyard was the highlight—an intimate yet spacious area with a lively bar that made for the perfect gathering spot.  
  
The craft cocktails were outstanding, each one creative, balanced, and beautifully presented. The bartenders clearly take pride in their work and offer thoughtful recommendations. Service throughout the event was top-notch: attentive without being intrusive, and genuinely warm.

Highly recommended!!!! 

I had the pleasure of attending a friend’s wedding organized by this company, and I was truly impressed. The venue was absolutely stunning, with beautiful decor and a welcoming atmosphere. The staff went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly, and you could tell they genuinely cared about making the day special. From start to finish, the experience was seamless and enjoyable. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a wedding venue that combines elegance, professionalism, and personal touch

Looking forward to the next time!!

The Brooklyn Roots staff I encountered were super nice and accommodating, and the hors d’oeuvres and drinks were so impressively delicious - and they were vegan!!
