Janelle and Stuart of Island Bliss Weddings brought our February 2025 destination wedding in St. Thomas beautifully to life. They are incredibly organized, knowledgeable about the islands, and made the entire planning process feel seamless. They helped us choose the perfect venue for our 90 guests at Villa Botanica, kept us on a clear planning timeline, and provided an excellent selection of trusted local vendors. They also planned our welcome party, helped with my bachelorette planning, helped with guest accommodations, and coordinated packages from the mainland. On the wedding day itself, everything ran beautifully! We couldn’t recommend Janelle and Stuart more highly.

Five stars across the board. Edie was so incredibly wonderful, easy, and accommodating to work with and she put together the most unbelievably gorgeous and fun event for us. It was honestly everything I could have hoped for. Edie works with only a select number of vendors who she knows are top notch. I was grateful that I didn't have to make a ton of choices, as she curated the lists beautifully. From the venue (ideal), to the food (and we live in NYC), to the flowers (stunning), to the transportation (friendly and reliable), the DJ (great variety and open to suggestions), and a super amazing boat ride (highlight for sure), it was the perfect weekend celebration for our daughter! Thank you, thank you! I could not recommend Edie enough!

Do yourself a favor, hire them now! My wife and I wanted a destination wedding without the hassle of working through all the logistics and difficult planning ourselves. Not only was THIS made reality, but on the planning side, things could NOT have gone better. We started contact with our coordinator around 6+ months out. And every time we talked she provided thoughts and ideas when they were needed but was equally open to our input and ideas on how we make this day OURS. Which brings me to THE day. Everything went EXACTLY as planned. The smallest of details were handled with the utmost care. We didn't have to worry about a thing! Everything was as it was described. There were no surprises, no let-downs, no "I wish we'd thought of THAT." Flawless execution. I am 100% recommending their services. In addition, the companies they partner with from the transportation to the photographer are top notch pro's. If you want the complete worry-free package, you've found it. Trust me.

Nan and her staff provided me with the perfect stress free wedding. We held our wedding at the Botanical Gardens on St. Thomas and it was the most beautiful wedding I have ever seen. Nan provided everything that she said she would, and more. Leading up to the wedding she was always available to answer questions and concerns. At the wedding her staff were all very friendly and professional. I would highly recommend Magical Wedding for your destination wedding.

She dedicated so much time to us with helping to find vendors and create a decor plan to make my wedding dreams come to life! Amber and her team made my wedding day run so smoothly, I had the most absolutely perfect day! She is amazing and I would recommend her to anyone!
