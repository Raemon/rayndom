Bula was absolutely incredible! He completely understood the assignment and the vibe we were going for — peaceful, classic Hawaiian background music that set the perfect tone for our wedding day. He delivered beyond our expectations. He and his dad made such a wonderful musician/vocalist duo during the reception, creating the most beautiful atmosphere. Our wedding was more of an intimate family dinner rather than a big party, and Bula read the room perfectly — his warm, fun personality made everyone feel so comfortable, especially during the hula dance! The hula dancers were amazing as well and added such a special Hawaiian touch. Our guests are still talking about how beautiful the music was, both during the ceremony and the reception. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience — Bula truly made our day unforgettable.

We started listening to Keoni on spotify after we booked him for our wedding day. He has an incredible voice and the music paired perfectly with our ceremony and cocktail hour vibes. Highly recommend hiring Keoni for your wedding!

We booked Kamuela as our wedding ceremony soloist and he was everything that we could have hoped and more. His rates are reasonable and you definitely get what you pay for in Kamuela. Planning a wedding in Honolulu while living on the mainland was difficult, but Kamuela was so easy to work with. He was always very responsive, even with the time difference, and gave us great music suggestions for our wedding processional and recessional. He also let us use one of his wireless mics and sound system for our ceremony Kamuela learned three specific songs for our ceremony and even though we had never rehearsed anything with him, his timing was spot on during the actual event. He also sounds even better in person and we go so many compliments about him from our guests Finally, as the rain started rolling in towards the end of our ceremony, Kamuela continued playing up until the last minute, even getting wet in the process, which we greatly appreciated. You really are in good hands with Kamuela.

Bonnie was simply wonderful! During the music selection process she helped me refine what I wanted and make the ceremony cohesive. She was amazing in adding in special requests for pieces that meant a lot to us and finding just the right harp- she was all professionalism and grace. Our guests kept complimenting the lovely effect the harp music had on the atmosphere of the ceremony! Her playing was beautiful and provided the perfect touch to our wedding.

How do you explain Brian Ivan? He is one of the most classy, enjoyable people to work with. From step one of booking our wedding date, to our emails and phone calls to confirm dates, he was always on top of it. Everything went perfectly as we discussed and I couldn't have been more thankful! I didn't even get the chance to hug him and thank him for helping make my dreams come true - but the Star Wars as I walked down the isle made Zakk cry before the doors opened. All the little touches we worked together to make my wedding ceremony perfect was so appreciate. I would recommend Brian to anyone ever, because quite frankly he is the best. Thank you!!

It has been 5 months since I was married and I forgot to write a review. Better late than never. Craig was fantastic!! We loved the music he played and his genuine character. Everyone at our wedding ranted and raved about him. HIGHLY RECOMMEND Craig.

Paul provided the music pre-ceremony, the processional, and played during the cocktail hour (longer than we thought we had paid for, making this a great value as well!). He let us plug in an iPhone to use his speakers for the recessional and cued it perfectly time-wise! He was flexible and reliable, a total professional. His music was absolutely beautiful. The ambiance was perfect and I can't imagine a more serene and calming backdrop for a wedding!
