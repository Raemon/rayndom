**Congratulations on your upcoming wedding! What sets Curlypri Services apart is that I can issue your marriage license on the spot—no County Clerk visit required. For couples seeking an intimate, curated setting, we also host ceremonies at our charming location in the historic mountain town of Julian, CA.**

Your ceremony is more than words—it's the emotional heart of your celebration. My approach blends warmth, professionalism, and storytelling to create a moment that reflects who you are as a couple. Whether your vision is intimate, romantic, spiritual, modern, or completely “just us,” every detail is shaped around your style, values, and love story.

As a bilingual wedding officiant, I create ceremonies in English, Spanish, or a meaningful blend of both. My signature style is centered on crafting a _curated, heartfelt experience_ that honors your culture, your journey, and the connection you share.

Based in Spring Valley and proudly serving all of San Diego County, I offer:

✨ **Confidential marriage licenses issued directly—no office visits**  
✨ **Bilingual ceremonies (English/Spanish)**  
✨ **A curated, custom-crafted ceremony experience**  
✨ **A micro-wedding setting in beautiful Julian, CA**  
✨ **A calm, reassuring presence from planning to “I do”**

My goal is to make your wedding feel effortless, meaningful, and unforgettable—while ensuring every legal detail is handled with accuracy and care.

Dates fill quickly, so reach out anytime. I would be honored to help bring your ceremony vision to life.

Warmly,  
**Priscilla – Curlypri Services**

My November Wedding 

We couldn’t have asked for a better officiant. From the very beginning, Priscilla was incredibly organized, responsive, and punctual. She guided us through every step with clarity and made the entire process stress free. Her attention to detail and timeliness truly stood out, everything happened exactly when and how she said it would. The quality of her work was exceptional.  
The ceremony felt personal, meaningful, and beautifully delivered. She took the time to understand our story and crafted a script that fit us perfectly. Her professionalism and warm uplifting attitude made us feel comfortable and supported throughout the entire experience.  
In terms of value, Priscilla exceeded our expectations. Her services were affordable, transparent, and absolutely worth every penny. She respected our budget and still provided top tier service that felt premium. We never once felt pressured or upsold.  
If you’re looking for someone who is reliable, compassionate, and truly dedicated to making your day special, look no further. We highly recommend her officiant and marriage license services.
