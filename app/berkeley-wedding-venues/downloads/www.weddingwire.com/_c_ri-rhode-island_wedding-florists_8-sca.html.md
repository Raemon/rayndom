Michelle took my Pinterest board and exceeded even my own wildest imaginations. We envisioned a ‘no color’ color palette for our wedding day, wanting only white florals and greenery which she executed to perfection. Not only is Michelle wonderful to work with, but the thoughtfulness she extends to your vision is simply unmatched. From the very beginning, we wanted the bridal bouquet to be made up of white peonies, but weren’t sure where to start with the groom’s boutonniere - wanting something that also stood out and was unique to him. Without hesitation, she gave us the idea of doing a white ranunculus which was not only the perfect complement to the peonies but an unexpected nod to his Italian heritage. From the pearl pins around the bouquet charm, to our deconstructed ceremony arch so effortlessly placed into the trees we’d selected to frame our ceremony, the candles glittering in every corner of every room, everywhere we turned Michelle and her team took our breath away. She unequivocally put her heart (and ours) into every floral arrangement and we could not recommend her enough.

Joy is a master at her craft. She was great to work with for our wedding. She met with us a few times to go over ideas and inspo pics, and what she designed on the day was nothing short of glorious. The bouquets and boutineers were stunning and she designed centerpieces that also doubled as the flowers lining the aisle. Her team transitioned the pieces from the ceremony to the reception during cocktail hour in such a seamless fashion, and the pieces looked perfect during both events. We could not thank Joy enough!

I worked with Meghan and she was the direct person I had been in touch with thru the whole process. I have worked with her for 3 other events so far. This last one I hired her for a 80th Bday party. The theme was good friends, bright colors and a fun time. We had a photo booth and sparkly linens in dark violet, her favorite color. I was meeting up with all the vendors at the venue, organizing what everyone was setting up and last minute questions. I was supposed to pick up by 4pm at Le's Isle Rose. I was late! I got stuck in traffic. Meghan stayed late to wait for us! She is awesome! They really helped to bring it all together-and the flowers were perfect for our clients! What a great group of siblings to have such a wonderful party for their mom!

Helen is so talented! I noticed when I was working with her throughout my wedding planning process, she is so attentive to detail and cares so much about both the florals and about her clients. Without a doubt, she gave it her all just to make my ideas come to life! If you are interested in working with her for any event, you won’t regret it.

Susan and her team created the perfect floral arrangements that matched my vision to a t. I went in with a relatively simple idea and she took it and made it as grand as the wedding venue deserved. They were so easy to work with and to communicate with. I can’t recommend Cherryhill Florist enough!! If you have the opportunity to work with them, don’t hesitate!
