I initially did not want to have a wedding with a barn reception. However, after coming to the venue it was quite clear that this was not a regular Kentucky barn. Once you walk inside it looks like a gorgeous venue as it is! There was no detail left unnoticed. It was a wonderful and amazing experience being surrounded by a beautiful house, land, and amazing barn. You will not be disappointed.

Could not say enough good things about this venue. It is a dream venue with the dream team. Beautiful venue, staff was amazing they went above and beyond for our wedding and made sure everything was perfect. The location was perfect. The best part is that you have the venue Thursday-Sunday so you don’t get to feel rushed AND the night of the wedding you can stay at the beautiful pink bed and breakfast down the street which is where the bridesmaids get ready the day of.

Hazelnut Farm was the perfect setting for our wedding. The grounds are stunning, and the vendors they work with are top notch. You are limited in who you are able to hire as vendors, but they all know how to use the space so well and their services were excellent. We loved having a covered outdoor ceremony and outdoor cocktail hour on their stunning grounds, and their ballroom was beautiful and large enough for a stage, band and 150 guests. The team is responsive and although it was on the higher end of our budget, we have no regrets with how beautiful the day was.

From the first time we visited The Vintage Barn at Merefield Farm, we were captivated. Missy showed us all around and we knew the reception just had to be there. We had hoped to have an August wedding, but when Covid made immigration issues take longer than normal with no end date in sight, Missy was kind and reassuring. She helped us pivot to a November wedding with an eye for all the details that also needed to pivot to help us have a successful reception. Missy & her staff made The Barn shine for us. Kind, thoughtful, & attentive to all the details that made for a successful evening! Our guests made so many positive comments about how cute The Barn was and what a great space it was to have a reception. Even though it was a chilly late November day, The Barn was warm & cozy and glowing! The Vintage Barn at Merefield Farm exceeded our expectations! Thank You Missy & all your Crew!!

We cannot say enough wonderful things about Sunset Ridge Farm Events! From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with such warmth and genuine kindness. Julie, the owner, was absolutely amazing. She is very kind, incredibly attentive, and truly invested in making our day everything we dreamed of. Her calm, friendly energy made the entire planning process smooth and stress-free. The whole team at Sunset Ridge Farm Events was just as personable and helpful. Every single person went above and beyond to ensure our wedding day was perfect. You can tell they truly care about their couples and take pride in the details. We felt supported, celebrated, and completely at ease from start to finish. The venue itself is stunning. If you’re looking for a place where you’ll not only have a beautiful wedding but also feel genuinely cared for, this is it. We could not have imagined a better experience and will forever be grateful to Julie and her amazing team for making our day so unforgettable. Highly, highly recommend!

We chose Ashford Acres Inn for my daughter’s wedding because we wanted a venue that offered both beauty and exceptional service—and we got so much more. Ashford Acres is special because it’s not just a stunning place, it’s a team that truly cares about every detail. The experience, the peace of mind, and the memories made were worth every single penny. I would highly recommend Ashford Acres to anyone planning a wedding or special event. And if you’re lucky enough to have Savannah as your coordinator, you’ll know immediately why it was the best investment we could have made for such an important day.

The silo venue and staff went above and beyond, the bridal house has all the space you will need for stylists and many bridesmaids. The gamble room for the guys is also very spacious and set up so they can play games or watch TV while they wait. The staff are all very professional and friendly and did an amazing job making sure everything was perfect on our special day!! I definitely recommend this venue to anyone who is getting married, everything turned out incredible.

Our wedding here was the best day of my life! The option of booking 2 days at the Keith Glenn venue was so worth the price! They have everything you need on your wedding day, including some amazing and friendly staff members who work on your day! My husband and I were able to show up on our day and get ready in peace with our friends and family. We are so grateful to have found this venue and can’t recommend it enough to other newly engaged couples!

The venue is absolutely beautiful. Scott had all the decorations for center pieces, the arch and much more. The venue, the scenery, and everything that can come with the venue if you choose is absolutely amazing. I couldn’t have had a better wedding anywhere else!

The best wedding venue ever! Thanks to Janna and her team, everything came together so perfectly and went smoothly on our wedding day. The Bluegrass Wedding Barn team brought our wedding vision to life. Planning was so easy and stress free considering we were planning our wedding from a distance and moved states in the middle of the process. It was absolutely magical to walk in to the venue on our wedding day and have everything already set up. Our friends and family were able to just come, celebrate, and enjoy the wedding with us instead of worrying about setting things up and tearing things down at the end of the night. I absolutely recommend the Bluegrass Wedding Barn. They are the perfect wedding venue for anyone who wants a stress free wedding day in the gorgeous Kentucky countryside!
