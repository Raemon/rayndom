My husband and I recently got married at YMCA Camp Icaghowan. The location was beautiful and the staff were fantastic, incredibly nice folks. We forgot our arch for the ceremony and camp staff made us a perfect, woodsy replacement that was even better than the one we had planned to bring. The kitchen staff were quick and fantastic as well, they did our late night snack and dessert bar which were both perfect. All of the staff we interacted with were incredibly nice and helpful with any little or big thing we needed. Can’t recommend the venue enough!

Stunning venue. Lynn and Felicia are the nicest people I have ever met. Sunrise Beach is the perfect place to choose if you want to have the most amazing, perfect day possible for your wedding. The venue is so beautiful and perfectly captures the essence of a Minnesota summer. 10/10 would recommend.

We had a simple ceremony at the Chapel Garden to renew our vows on our 10 year anniversary. Katie Kline was our coordinator and the Winter Monk was our officiant. Both were professional and knowledgeable. In our email exchanges with Katie to get everything set, she was really great about making sure we did the things on her list as well as answering all of our questions. Both Katie and our officiant were easy to get ahold of on the phone as well. The rental fee had some parking passes and tickets included--all of that went really smoothly in the parking lot and at the gate. Our attendees had no problems and had a blast. Katie was present during the ceremony, which was lovely. The Chapel Garden is not private. We had a few random festival goers cheering for us when we kissed. But that was completely fine with us. There was a wedding going on at the same time inside a private tent. Our day was not the BIG day, but if it had been, I think it all would have gone just as smoothly. And Katie did not brush us off for any request even though we were renewing vows as opposed to getting married. Of course, the festival itself was fantastic. The highlight for the kids was the Mermaid Cove. It rained on and off all day, but it was too much fun to care. Lots of great memories made.

This was the most beautiful venue for our wedding. Everything from the serene nature, private lake, and gorgeous venue was perfect. I knew I wanted to get married in nature and this place was the perfect mix of nature and amenities. The home is a refurbished Montessori so had plenty of space (and bathrooms!) for our wedding party to stay and get ready. The state of the art kitchen made mornings and after ceremony snacks fun and easy. Richelle was a blessing and answered all our questions and met all of our needs with enthusiasm and precision. I loved every detail about this perfectly curated home and the vast nature and lake are perfect the way only nature is. Thank you so much Richelle! I have a feeling this special place will be a part of many future family vacations.

Our wedding reception was beautiful here. The ability to be so close to downtown St. Paul was so much fun and there was a great backdrop for pictures. For us it was important to have a great venue that didn't need extra draping or uplighting, which we got here. The venue was beautiful all on its own. In addition to the great space, the team was fantastic. Every time I had a question Brittany was willing to chat it through and make adjustments when needed. The day of team was also great. Would definitely recommend this venue.

Reeds and Rushes is truly one of the best wedding venues out there! From our very first meeting to the big day, they were incredibly organized and a joy to work with. The venue itself had the perfect modern aesthetic we were looking for, and both the bridal and groom’s suites were outstanding. Our guests loved the patio space and it was wonderful having an area where they could relax by the fire, play games, and visit. The staff went above and beyond to bring our vision to life, and we couldn’t be more grateful! Choosing Reeds and Rushes was, without a doubt, one of the best decisions!

Camrose Hill was literally a dream. The venue is so so beautiful and it was absolutely perfect for what we wanted. The venue is already decorated so nicely that I hardly had to bring any decorations myself! Cindie is very responsive and lent us a lot of things we used for table decorations, which probably saved us a lot of money! We also gave her very little to work with on how to make the bouquets and she did so so so so amazing. The bouquets were absolutely perfect and so beautiful, I still haven't gotten over them yet! Highly recommend Camrose Hill. All night, our guests couldn't stop telling us how beautiful the venue was. We didn't pay for the day-of coordinator, Susan but she was still there for the ceremony and reception and helped answer some questions and be a point of contact with the vendors. I had my bridesmaids and groomsmen set up all the decorations and the chairs. So if you're wondering if the day can go smoothly without hiring Susan, the day-of coordinator, know that it totally can, you will just have to do more logistical planning and have family and friends do all the setup and cleanup - for us it was worth saving the money. All in all, 100% recommend Camrose Hill for your big day!!

We loved our experience at Giants Ridge. Our wedding day was absolutely incredible. Pros: value, food, assistance with clean-up, views \- This was the cheapest venue we toured, but it did not show!! It was reasonably priced and absolutely gorgeous. No food & beverage minimum, which was awesome. Also, they help clean up after the night is over! A lot of people pay a lot of money for this service, which is just included in their service! Amazing. \- The food was fabulous. We heard lots of good things about it! \- The view at the Quarry Overlook was unbeatable. Just gorgeous and special and unforgettable. Cons: staff turnover, communication issues, hotel frustrations \- When we started working with Giants Ridge, we were with Matthew as a coordinator. Quickly, he left, and someone else took over. Then, that person left. Our stable and consistent staff was Jess, who was amazing and professional, but has also recently left shortly after our wedding. \- The biggest frustration of the day was that we were supposed to get into the Gold Room at 7 AM. We paid to reserve this room. At 7 AM, it was still locked. I found staff at The Lodge (their hotel), who does not work directly with the venue, which creates communication issues. They told me that this happens often, but there was not much they could do. We eventually got in an hour late, which put the whole day on delay. Staff did not seem to realize their mistake (despite several emails and voicemails left) and did not apologize. \- The Lodge was a nightmare to coordinate with for a hotel room block. We worked with Doug, who was ridiculously slow with email responsiveness to lock in a hotel room block. Again, them not working directly with the venue makes the process more stressful and frustrating. Overall, would definitely recommend!

I would highly recommend the Hyland Hills Ski Area as a wedding venue for anyone who is interested. The space is beautiful, and can accommodate events of many different sizes. It is also super affordable to rent, even for a larger group! We initially met with Suzanne, who was extremely helpful in helping us make our decision. She was transparent about the venue, and did not make us feel pressured to make a decision. Once we decided to book the venue for our wedding, we worked with Gabby as our day of coordinator. Gabby did an amazing job, and I would highly recommend paying extra for a DOC through the venue since they know the space so well. Gabby helped us with every question we had, and was a hero on the day of the wedding, making sure that everything ran smoothly. All other staff members were wonderful as well, and we got many compliments on the venue. Thank you Hyland Hills!

Spirit Mountain was the perfect venue for our wedding. From the gorgeous views overlooking Lake Superior in the MooseHead room to the lush greenery which served as a stunning backdrop for wedding photos, this venue truly left us amazed. We had a very good experience working with the venue staff throughout our entire experience, from planning to the day of. Overall everyone was very responsive, friendly, and professional. We especially want to highlight the efforts of the head chef who not only worked with us to create a new dish to accommodate our guests who subscribe to more plant-based diets, but also his leadership and great care which led to everything tasting AMAZING (e.g., prime rib, potatoes, vegetables, etc.). Our guests repeatedly gave us the feedback that the venue food was SO GOOD which was great to hear. We absolutely recommend Spirit Mountain for a lovely wedding venue!
