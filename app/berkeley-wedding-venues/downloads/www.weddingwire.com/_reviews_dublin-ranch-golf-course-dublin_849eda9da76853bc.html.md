A Dream Wedding Day—Even Through the Unexpected! 

Our wedding day didn’t go exactly as planned—but in the most beautiful way possible. From the moment we booked the venue, we knew we had found a hidden gem. The space was absolutely stunning and incredibly affordable compared to others we looked at. Every corner felt romantic and well thought out, and we were truly blown away by the value we received.  
  
But what made our experience truly unforgettable was Carolina, the venue coordinator. When a few unforeseen challenges came our way (as they sometimes do with weddings), Carolina handled every single issue with such grace, confidence, and calm. She truly became the hero of our day, stepping in and making adjustments without ever letting us feel stressed. Her professionalism and kindness turned potential chaos into seamless beauty.  
  
Thanks to her and the amazing team, our wedding turned out to be the most beautiful day of our lives. Everything came together in a way that felt magical. We were able to soak in every moment, surrounded by love and beauty, without worrying about a thing.  
  
If you’re considering this venue—don’t hesitate. You’ll get more than you pay for in all the best ways. We couldn’t be more grateful for the experience and for Carolina’s unwavering support. Our hearts are full!  


    * Dublin Ranch Golf Course's reply: 

Dear Phosa & Benjamin,  
  
Thank you so much for your incredibly kind words! It truly means the world to me and our team to hear how special your day turned out, even with a few surprises along the way. Your grace and trust throughout the planning process made it such a joy to work with you.  
  
Seeing everything come together so beautifully and knowing you were able to fully enjoy your day is exactly why we do what we do. I’m honored to have played a part in your celebration and will always remember it fondly.  
  
Wishing you a lifetime of love, laughter, and unforgettable memories. Please stay in touch—you’ll always be part of the Dublin Ranch family!  
  
Warmly,  
Carolina

50th Wedding Celebration

We couldn't have picked a more perfect location for our 50th Wedding Celebration than Dublin Ranch Golf Course. Carolina Perez, their Catering Sales & Marketing Director, was a true professional and incredibly helpful, guiding us through all the details from the menu and table arrangements to linen colors and the sound system. The May weather was beautiful, allowing our guests to mingle and enjoy appetizers and an open bar on the outside patio. Afterward, they moved into the main event room, where eleven beautifully decorated tables were set to welcome them. The venue was a resounding success with all our guests! 

Dublin Ranch Golf Course's reply: 

Dear Fran, thank you so much for your heartfelt review! It was truly an honor to be part of such a special milestone in your lives. We're so glad the weather cooperated and that your guests were able to enjoy both our patio and beautifully set main room. Your kind words mean the world, and I’m especially grateful you felt supported throughout the planning process. Wishing you many more years of love and celebration!

Dublin Ranch is Top Notch!

The staff at Dublin Ranch are true professionals. They are able to shift gears quickly and willingly when clients have changes. The reception space is perfect..not too big to be impersonal and cold. Not too small to feel cramped. The staff was friendly and accommodating. 

Dublin Ranch Golf Course's reply: 

Dear Chris, thank you so much for your kind words! We're thrilled to hear you had a great experience at Dublin Ranch. Our team takes pride in being flexible and attentive, and it means a lot to know that the space and service met your expectations. We truly appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback!

Dublin Ranch Golf Course - nothing short of magical!

From the moment we toured the venue, we knew it was the perfect spot for our big day. The lush greenery and breathtaking golf course and amazing sunset setting created a fairytale atmosphere that made our reception unforgettable.  
  
Pros:  
Stunning Location: The garden itself is a beautiful blend of nature and elegance with an amazing patio. We had our cocktail hour outdoors in the patio with the most beautiful sunset as the backdrop. It felt intimate yet grand, and the photos were absolutely stunning.  
  
Flexible Indoor/Outdoor Options: We were able to choose both an outdoor feel and indoor reception space. The indoor ballroom was equally impressive with its high ceilings, crystal chandeliers, and spacious layout. We felt confident no matter the weather!  
  
Professional and Friendly Staff: The team at Dublin Ranch went above and beyond to make our day stress-free. From the wedding coordinator, Carolina to the service staff, everyone was incredibly organized, attentive, and made sure every detail was taken care of.  
  
Convenience: The venue offers ample parking, and the location is easy for our out-of-town guests to find. There’s also a bridal suite and groom's lounge, which made getting ready a breeze.  
  
Con: The venue has specific time/schedule restrictions on when food service can start and end which might be difficult to work around different events/reception events however the team was flexible for us to make the experience seamless. 

Dublin Ranch Golf Course's reply: 

Thank you so much for your kind words! We’re thrilled to hear that Dublin Ranch Golf Course was the perfect setting for your big day. It was truly a pleasure being part of such a special moment in your lives!  
  
We’re so glad you loved the stunning views, flexible indoor/outdoor spaces, and the dedicated service from our team. Your feedback means the world to us, and we appreciate you highlighting both the pros and the areas where we strive to be as accommodating as possible.  
  
Wishing you both a lifetime of love and happiness! 💕 If you ever have any future celebrations, we’d love to welcome you back!  
  
Best,  
Carolina & The Dublin Ranch Team

Our Indian Wedding 

Location was absolutely beautiful for any kind of wedding but sadly we had very bad weather on our wedding day but still, our indoor wedding was decent. Last min changes of decorations and plans. Little hectic but Dublin Ranch Golf team was very accommodating on changing the plan. Overall I had a decent Indian wedding and I am happy with it.

This venue is very elegant - from the exterior of the building to the simple sophisticated interiors (I love shutters). Plus the beautiful view out in the patio! Perfect for intimate gathering.  
A plus is it is very budget-friendly. They accept outside catering which really helped us meet our budget.

The price is very affordable and the venue looks amazing! Randie is very organized and covered all the bases. We met a few times in person, but also corresponded a lot through email and she was super responsive. We made some changes to the table arrangements as the day got closer and there were no complaints! Randie sent us the updated plan almost immediately. On the day of the wedding, everything was perfect and just as we expected. While Randie doesn't stay with you the entire day (that's the responsibility of the banquet captain), she was there to help guide us through the ceremony which was great because we had met with her for the rehearsal. My bridesmaids interacted with the banquet captain and mentioned that she was wonderful to work with as well. The golf course does back up against houses so our concern had been the noise level on our wedding day, but every time we went there it was generally quiet. On our wedding day, there was a little bit of noise, but I barely heard it and no one else did. Overall, very happy and would recommend them to anyone!

We had our ideal wedding ceremony at Dublin Ranch Golf Course. It was a beautiful venue overlooking the hills. The staff was extremely accommodating and very kind. We would recommend this place to anyone considering getting married here. Randie Hill helped coordinate and she was very helpful. She was polite and very firm in ensuring things ran according to schedule. Thank you Randie and Dublin Ranch Golf Course!

We originally started working with Krystle, she was very knowledgeable and very helpful. When we went into make our final payment before the wedding she let us know that she would not be working with us for the of the time. Robert took over where she left off. He to was very knowledgable and pleasant to work with. If you want Dublin Ranch to rent things for you they will. The food was really good, we did buffet style and I heard bad things about the woman serving the meat. The only reason I didn't rate them all with 5 stars is because of the woman with the meat, there ae things that are missing that I still ha net gotten back, and the staff started cleaning up before the reception was over.

Tracy, the event coordinator was amazing. She was able to take care of all of our requests. The day of we didn't have to worry about a thing. The food was amazing. We loved the options that were offered to us and she was very accommodating with mixing up the options from the different menus. We were able to fit everybody's dietary needs!

What a terrific location for a ceremony and reception! Where do I start....the food was AMAZING! Many guests told us they loved the food and would go back to the golf course for a meal. The on-site coordinator did her best to make our day special. The location is ideal for a smaller intimate wedding (140 or less). Their flexibility was impressive (we were able to have our ceremony outside...it rained the whole week before our wedding and an hour after the ceremony). One thing I didn't like about the location...quite a few of our pictures during the ceremony contain houses in the background since the golf course is surrounded by residential homes....I didn't like this so much, but I'm sure your photographer can use his/her camera tricks to exclude the houses.

The venue was beautiful, the food was amazing, and the service at our wedding was fabulous. Unfortunately, over the course of the last four month leading up to our wedding the Event Coordinator position turned over three times and much of our information was lost in the shuffle. This led to an event happening at the venue hours before our wedding, a higher charge for corkage, and extra time spent filling the new coordinators in on everything all over again.

Can hold up to about 150 people comfortably for an indoor reception.  
Sue was absolutely amazing, prepared and, made the day much less stressful. She made sure the bride and groom ate. She also helped me hide my pregnancy from the guest. They are very flexible here.

My husband and I chose this location based on their willingness to meet our budget needs. The planning up until our wedding day was rough, but the coordinator we ended up with on the day of the wedding, Randi was PHENOMENAL! To make a long story short, we only had our reception here. After we signed our contract a year before our wedding day we didn't think that we would be working with three different coordinators/site managers, but we did. Make sure to stay on top of food tasting, and payment timelines to ensure that everything goes smoothly. Nobody set the food tasting date with us, I had to make sure we set up a time and location 4 months before our wedding day. In addition, make sure if they are willing to work within your budget that you get all the adjustments made to the contract written on the one you are signing. Overall, Our guests complimented us on finding the location and how great the food was (parents even complimented the children's dinners). Thank you Dublin Ranch for making this reception location a place to remember celebrating our special day of union.

Everything was perfect and great up until my reception. The wedding coordinator had semi disappeared and was no where to be found for quite some time, I did notice that the other bridal party had arrived for the wedding after mine so I assume that she had to work with them closer to their time slot. Would've been nicer if we were just told that versus disappearing. It wasn't that big of deal for me because I knew exactly what to do for my own wedding but I also shouldn't have to be figuring it out. I am equally a bride as the other one and should've had her full undivided attention. This probably will not happen to anyone else other than me especially if you are not experienced in throwing events. I am so I handled it pretty well. :) other than that this place is GORGEOUS and the staff is very nice and helpful all the way from the beginning.

Terrible venue, we loved Catherine at first, but once management fired her everything went down hill from there. Robert was terrible and our contract was not followed as promised by Catherine. Robert refused to stick to the agreed upon items, tacked on extra charges and ruined my wedding day. The food was wrong, nothing was set up on time, my signature drink was wrong, his staff was the back of my ceremony photos, golfers and carts were in my ceremony photos. IT WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE, DO NOT GO TO THIS VENUE!! If you are looking for something nearby, go to Poppy Ridge and ask for Brian!!
