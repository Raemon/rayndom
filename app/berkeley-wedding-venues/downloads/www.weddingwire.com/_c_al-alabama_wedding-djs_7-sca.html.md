Our Precious Wedding DJ MacLarry graciously accepted our invitation to provide a unique and heartfelt musical experience in Panola, Alabama. He was truly five tiers above the rest. With unmatched professionalism and flexibility, he delivered a full-service evening of entertainment that exceeded all expectations. He catered to the crowd, graciously accepted song requests, and skillfully matched the music to the mood and tempo of each moment. The atmosphere was electric, joyful, and unforgettable. We were deeply blessed by his presence and the joy he brought to our special day. ❤️🙏🏿.,Highly recommended

My wife and I are so glad we found DJ LIT. They were responsive and professional every step of the way, and they kept the energy UP during our wedding reception. I would definitely recommend to anybody! They're some of the nicest folks you'll ever meet, too.

The team at RTR Pro Entertainment has figured out how to provide the PERFECT vibe (music and/or lighting, photo booth, you name it) for every event. From engagement party to ceremony to reception, it doesn't matter the size of the party nor the space - they can handle it. But more than that, they're absolute professionals from start to finish, no matter who you're dealing with. Total class - highly recommend.

DJBreezy was fantastic! 10/10 and we had the best time! He made sure everything was taken care of with mics and kept the dance floor vibes great! If anything didn't go as planned we had no idea. We truly couldn't have asked for a better night! Thank you so much for much all you, Brennan and the team did to make the night so special!

Room3 Productions made my wedding! I first came across James at a wedding show and I am so glad I wrote down my contact info that day because I got the deal of a lifetime. He provided forms to help us narrow down music selections early on in the planning process, and those forms were amazing. They were so detailed but also had suggestions in case you drew a blank. James did an amazing job keeping the dance floor full all night and consolidating all of our requests into a really amazing playlist that appealed to all of our guests! We purchased Room3's second largest package for our wedding. This included lighting, a personalized projection, and their amazing DJing services. They were truly focused on helping us have the best possible wedding we could and it was so obvious that this is something they LOVE doing. My family is actually trying to come up with a reason to have them DJ for us again soon, that's how impressed they were. Thank you!!

I've known Jerry through several events he has hosted and local trivia nights. He definitely knows what he is doing and was ome of my vendors that was very confident and easy to adapt to everything! He managed ceremomy and reception music and hosted trivia during my reception. I loved his trivia questions and he even implemented couples trivia. He has a good sense for reading the room and knows how to work a crowd. One of my favorite services my wedding day!
