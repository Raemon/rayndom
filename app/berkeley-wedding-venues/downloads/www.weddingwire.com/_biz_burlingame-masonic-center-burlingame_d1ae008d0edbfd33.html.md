## About

The Burlingame Masonic Center was built in 1927 as the home of the Burlingame Masonic Lodge. The Lodge along with other Masonic Organizations such as the Burlingame Scottish Rite and the Order of the Eastern Star still calls the building home. The rentable areas of the building are located on the second floor, accessible by a formal staircase and an elevator, and consists of two large rooms which can be rented separately or together.

The first room is a two story tall, 20’ x 40’ Banquet room which can comfortably seat up to 160 people for a sit down dinner. It has beautiful hardwood floors, large French door windows for natural light and six dimmable chandeliers. The room also features a stage that can accommodate up to six musicians or a DJ and equipment. Adjacent to the banquet room is a newly remodeled kitchen. Rental of this room includes the use of 72” round tables which comfortably seat up to ten people as well as our standard chairs.

The second room is an equally large room and is a two story tall formal room that can be used as a wedding chapel, a concert/recital facility or a meeting space. The floor is carpeted and it has a working theatrical stage. The room has a Baby Grand piano and in the balcony is an organ and the control boards for the sound and lighting equipment.
