October Wedding Weekend

The Thomas Delano House was the absolute perfect choice for our October wedding in Portland. We stayed there for the weekend with both sides of our families and hosted our ceremony and farewell brunch in the garden.   
  
The house itself is extremely charming and comfortable for a group of 18 that included several toddlers and grandparents. Everyone had plenty of space to relax, cook together, and enjoy late nights around the outdoor fire. The house was well stocked for cooking and family dinners. The barn is heated and is the perfect hangout on chilly evenings.  
  
The garden was the most beautiful, intimate setting for both our wedding ceremony and our farewell brunch the next morning. Kristen and Steve went above and beyond—offering to coordinate both events and completely exceeding my expectations. They provided all the chairs, champagne glasses, and a delicious high-quality brunch so we could simply enjoy every moment.  
  
From the very beginning, Kristen and Steve were amazing to work with—warm, responsive, and genuinely dedicated to making our weekend special. They referred us to local vendors and even introduced us to Christa, who became our day-of coordinator and felt like a fairy godmother. I was so grateful to work with such incredible partners for our wedding weekend.  
  
It’s clear that Kristen and Steve care deeply about both the history of the house and the joy of celebrating there. I highly recommend this venue if you’re looking for an intimate celebration and a memorable weekend!
