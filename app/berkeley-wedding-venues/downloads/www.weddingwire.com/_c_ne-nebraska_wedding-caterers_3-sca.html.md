I put the majority of my praises on the Founders One Nine review, however, it must be emphasized that THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!! Not only that, they play a huge role in individualizing every wedding they cater. My husband really wanted root beer floats at our wedding, and they went all out to make a root beer float bar happen, with the works. Those added touches put a lot less stress on us with planning, but it really shows how much pride they take in their product. It really made our wedding amazing

Take'Em Catering with Phil Sweeney offered our guests comfort food classics--fried chicken tenders, hamburgers, pulled chicken sandwiches, gourmet macaroni and cheese, smashed potatoes, fresh fruit and vegetables with your choice of condiments. No one went hungry and he even sent home leftovers for the bride and groom. Buffet service went quickly and smoothly and the tableware was solid.

My husband and I were deeply impressed with Grillmasters' full-service catering. They catered our wedding in December 2024. Our wedding venue was my husband's barn in small-town Nebraska. Grillmasters’ team was able to accommodate our rural location with their mobile kitchen. Moreover, the team asked thorough questions regarding our wedding's theme and design. Our wedding vision was "rustic barn, Hallmark Christmas movie." We communicated this vision to Grillmasters and they went above and beyond to deliver. Their catering display was phenomenal and perfectly matched the barn's other decor. I was in awe of their display! Additionally, Grillmasters was responsive to our questions and accommodated requests, such as adding vegetarian dishes to the menu. By way of example, I called Grillmasters a few weeks before the wedding to increase our party size. They not only accommodated my request, but also told me how excited they were for my Christmas-themed wedding. It was comforting and heartwarming to hear that Grillmasters was genuinely excited to be involved. In addition to outstanding presentation and communication, Grillmasters' food was amazing. The appetizers, entrees, and sides were flavorful and fresh. We particularly loved the Caprese Skewers and Spinach Artichoke Phyllo Cups appetizers. Our guests raved about the Smoked Hawaiian Bacon Wrapped Glazed Chicken and the Maple Glazed Carrots. Multiple guests returned to the buffet line for seconds. They also packaged and returned the leftovers, assisted with preparing champagne flutes for our toast, and sliced/distributed cake. In sum, I highly recommend Grillmasters Catering. The team is professional, talented, and truly a pleasure to work with.

Hawk's BBQ was the best caterer to work with! Not only are the owners super friendly and personable, but their prices are competitive, and they even offered free hot dogs for kids, and automatically included however many jack fruit / vegan / veggie options that we needed. They were professional, on time, and the food was delicious! We received so many compliments on the food during our reception!! Would absolutely recommend and consider hiring again if I ever needed a caterer for another event!

Doorstep Diner catered our annual church event in February in (Lincoln, NE ~ 100 attendees ~ buffet of heavy hors d'oeuvres). I had nothing but rave reviews. (We will use them again next year)! They were so good that I used them for an event with my sorority in March and had more of the same - totally different menu, delivered a hot buffet (Ashland, NE ~ 25 attendees) and everyone was impressed. HIGHLY recommend!

We used All Inclusive Catering for our wedding day and we got so many compliments on our food! Matt was great to work with, very responsive, and accommodating to what we were wanting for our wedding day dinner. It was hard to choose between what appetizers, entrees, and sides we wanted because everything was so amazing when we did our tasting. Would highly recommend All Inclusive Catering for your wedding day!

We are so happy that we went with Patricia Catering and Cocktails as the caterer for our wedding. The staff was super friendly and responsive throughout all of our communication with them, and they answered all the questions we had. We even had a couple of last-minute changes that they agreed to do with no problems at all! We had several people attending our wedding that needed specific gluten-free meals, and they were able to make completely separate plates for them at no extra charge. The food was also incredible! A lot of the other caterers that we had tested were good, but they just tasted like typical wedding reception food. You could really tell that Patricia’s goes above and beyond in the quality and taste of their food. My only critique was that even as the first ones of the night to eat, the food was a little bit cold, but that was easy to overlook with how delicious it was. They even offered a service to us for cutting the cake at no additional charge, we would highly recommend them!

The wedding and the reception were held in the same building but seperate rooms. The catering was fantastic. The food was very good and everything was done very eloquently. The prices were per person and were reasonable. They offered both a self-serve and a full service plan.
