What I paid for what I got was worth the money for the ceremony and reception. Having the reception at Haleiwa Joes was great for our guests to walk right up to the restaurant right after the ceremony. Coordinators were great and easy to work with and communication was quick. Definitely would recommend for anyone looking for a Hawaii wedding.

Tom Sasagake and his team were fantastic! Responsive, professional, and very easy to work with. We had a small wedding and reception at Waikiki Leia and a rehearsal dinner at Ocean Suite in Honolulu that consisted of a large multicultural family and several picky eaters and a food allergy. Tom and both his venues did not disappoint with exceptional attention to detail and consistent attentiveness to all guest needs. The food was exceptionally high quality. Beyond taste and quality, the set-up, presentation, delivery, and service were just as wonderful. We shopped multiple venues and caterers, and Tom was easily the most competitive in his pricing. I highly recommend using tom and either of his venues (Ocean Suite or Waikiki Luea) for all your small private events. Both locations easily accommodated our 30 guests in a spectacular setting.

There are so many wonderful things to write about in this review about our experience in planning our wedding from the beginning to the end but we can't thank Aunty Gwen and her staff enough for the most magical wedding ever. Mahaloz for everything! Aunty Gwen was just the best. Her aloha and wonderful guidance made our wedding amazing. She's a fantastic communicate and truly wants you to have the best wedding ever. My husband and I fell in love with the grounds, especially the majestic tree that we got married in front of. We also loved the fact that we were able to honor our ancestors in both our Hawaiian and Mexican traditions in this beautiful valley. We even were blessed with a sprinkle of rain, which is a beautiful sign that our loved ones who had past were there with us, listening. The grounds were beautifully tended and the waterfall was perfect. No Cows!! LOL! I would recommend this venue to anyone and everyone looking to have their wedding ceremony and photo's taken there. You are not only creating memories for just yourself but your guests will have the best experience ever. We are looking forward to going back to take pictures in front of that magical tree and thank Aunty Gwen once again for all her aloha.

Getting married at Kualoa Ranch was an absolute dream. The setting is beyond beautiful—lush, dramatic, and uniquely Hawaiian. It truly felt like we were in a movie. The entire venue was perfect from start to finish. The natural scenery alone is enough to take your breath away, but the staff also made everything smooth and stress-free. Our ceremony and reception felt so grounded in the spirit of the land, and we couldn’t have asked for a more meaningful or stunning place to begin our marriage. We’re so grateful to have had our wedding in such a special place. Mahalo nui loa, Kualoa Ranch!

It was the most beautiful setting for our wedding. We got married on the main lawn. The staff were incredibly responsive and had lots of great suggestions. They had a back up plan for a rainy day. We wanted a more quite and comfortable setting than the beach. We tool pictures in front of the waterfall. So we had all the great parts of Hawaii in our wedding. Tinker is the coordinator and she is amazing and sweet.

There aren’t enough good things to say about Regina’s abilities as a hair stylist and make-up artist. When my husband and I got married, we held our wedding at Kapalua Bay and stayed for the duration of our honeymoon at the Ritz-Carlton. The day before our wedding, Regina called me at the hotel to understand what I wanted for my wedding. She was incredibly thorough – asking about my style preferences, informing me on how to prepare my hair and skin and asking if there were any Hawaiian flowers that I wanted to incorporate into my style. The 10 minute call really put my mind at ease and demonstrated how much she cared. On the day of our wedding, Regina travelled to our hotel and set up a “styling station” in our room which allowed me to relax in comfort and really take in the moment. I showed Regina a picture of how I wanted my hair and make-up to look and she completely exceeded my expectations. Even on a good day, my hair is difficult to style, but Regina made me look better than I ever could have expected. When my soon-to-be husband saw me for the first time, he was completely blown away – a true testament of Regina’s work. Beyond her abilities, she was also very nice and incredibly conversational – two great qualities when you are preparing to walk down the aisle. I recommend Regina to anyone in Maui who needs to be styled for their wedding – you will not regret it!

Neal, the mgr at Nani Mau, provided great customer service with a smile. As an establishment Nani Mau offers great food and a beautiful natural venue for a reasonable price that's completely worth it.

I couldn’t say enough nice things about this venue! It was absolutely perfect for our wedding! Sugako was so nice and helpful throughout the entire planning process. Everything was stunning. All of our guests raved about how beautiful of a wedding it was, and so much of that credit goes to Sugako and the Hawaii Polo Club! Thanks again!

We loved the outdoor indoor options for the wedding ceremony to be down on the grounds, and the reception in the hall. Everyone was so nice and helpful, it was a solid space and the vendors were very comfortable setting up and we had plenty of room for all of our guests.
