Amazing!

Kim at the Kaminski House Museum was so great to work with!! She was very responsive with any questions we had, and was willing to send pictures of things we had questions about since we were out of town. She was always flexible with meeting us to go over the grounds at the venue and made the process so easy! The Kaminski House Museum is so well taken care of and absolutely gorgeous! Our guests were so amazed of it's views and how well kept the grounds were. Thank you for everything Kim, and thank you for helping make our day PERFECT!!!

We hosted our wedding three weeks ago at The Kaminski House and The Stewart Parker House. The best way to describe these properties are hidden gems. We could not have asked for a more gorgeous venue for our wedding. Everything could not get over the beautiful old homes, the large trees, and being right on the water! It truly had the best of everything, and for such a great price. Kim Leatherwood is wonderful to work with and is there to help at every point. I couldn't imagine getting married anywhere else.

Love this venue and their flexibility. I wanted my wedding to be on Tuesday and they are one of the only venues who would allow it! They are so east to work with and made my ceremony and reception amazing. We got the security deposit back quickly as well. It was postmarked the morning after the wedding! I would recommend the Kaminski House to anyone. The views are beautiful and everything was wonderful!

Worse treatment ever. Spoke with coordinator and arranged time to meet (one day later). Offered to give her the deposit over the phone but she said no worries. Traveled over 100 miles for meeting, give deposit and sign contract just for her to tell me she rented to someone else. Most unprofessional person I’ve ever met. Guess you have to be a “friend” to rent this place. So disappointed for my daughter. Would not recommend them to a slug!
