Everything Was Seamless!

We hired Coast to Coast for mahogany garden chairs for our wedding reception. They were hundreds of dollars less than what other rental companies were asking, included delivery, set up and breakdown, and were on time for delivery and pick up. We highly recommend them for anyone looking for event rentals.

Easy to work with

Pam and the entire Coast to Coast team were friendly and easy to work with. On time with deliveries and no issues with their products. They even gave us extra chairs to use for our event at no extra charge!

We hired Coast to Coast Event Rentals for our beach wedding needs. We rented a large tent with lighting, tables, chairs, and a wedding arch. Everyone was so great to work with from Krissy, who assisted with the rental details to the men who came and put it all together! Krissy was patient and very flexible as our details would change often! The men who put the tent up and did the delivery were very pleasant and hard working! I thought we had to put all the chairs and table s up ourselves, but they did it for us! They were very punctual and called prior to arrival. The entire experience working with them was great. I highly recommend them!

We used Coast to Coast Event Rentals for the wedding chairs used for the ceremony as well as water goblets for the tables. They have a wide variety of products to choose from. You can view them in their showroom or through their online catalog. it was very easy to browse the online catalog and complete my order through the website. I still chose to go into the office and worked with Krissy who was great throughout our entire process. I would highly recommend Coast to Coast Event rentals!

My daughter's wedding was 4/16/16.She lives in Texas,so my husband and I would go there at least once a month.  
The girls were so patient and nice.They would set the tables and chairs,all different color combinations so we could text pics to my daughter so she could choose the colors.I cannot say enough of how accommodating they were.I would not use anyone else if we have any other events in the future.You will be very pleased with Coast to Coast!

It was SO easy to order what we needed on their website. We arrived the day before our wedding to pickup the rental items and they had their stuff together. They had me sign the paperwork and then drive around to the side so they could put everything in the car. After the event we threw everything in a bag and brought everything (minus a few chair sashes that one of my bridesmaids stole :o) back to the business. They charged us a VERY minimal amount for the missing chair sashes. Everything was as represented on the website and I think it was good value for what we paid.

Had a beach wedding at a hotel in redington shores fl for about 100 quests. I rented tables, chairs, and a few extras. Coast to coast was great to deal with from their website to the show floor to the delivery and pickup. The delivery crew even moved all equiptment through the entire hotel to the beach. This operation is a true class act. Great job Coast to coast and thank you so much for an unforgettable weekend.

Coast to Coast was great to work with. It was very easy to stop by their show room, sign a contract for the items you wanted to rent, ad pick them up/drop them off. Very affordable and lots of unique items to spruce up your wedding!
