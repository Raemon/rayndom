10/10 - Amazing Wedding DJ

Marlene (DJ Lady FX) was an absolute dream! From our very first conversation, she completely understood our vibe — fun, energetic, elegant, but never cheesy — and she nailed it from start to finish. She seamlessly handled everything from our ceremony music to cocktail hour to an epic dance floor that never stopped. Communication was effortless, and she went above and beyond to accommodate our unique requests (including a custom 30-minute Beyoncé medley that brought the house down). Marlene read the room beautifully, mixing crowd-pleasers with our personal favorites while keeping the energy high all night long. Not a single awkward lull, not a single song we didn’t love — just pure joy. So many of our guests told us she was the best wedding DJ they’d ever experienced, and we couldn’t agree more. She made the night unforgettable.

Provided such a personal touch to our big day!

We had such a wonderful experience working with Dj Last DX! From the very beginning, she was incredibly enjoyable to work with—kind, professional, and genuinely invested in making our day special. She really took the time to listen to what we wanted, offered thoughtful guidance when we needed it, and helped shape the energy of the night in a way that truly reflected us as a couple.  
  
What stood out the most was her flexibility—she was able to pivot effortlessly with last-minute changes and kept everything flowing smoothly without missing a beat. Our guests had a great time on the dance floor, and we received so many compliments on the music.  
  
The photobooth was also a big hit! The slideshow created for it was put together so well and made the night even more special.  
  
We’re so grateful we had her as part of our wedding team. Highly recommend!

Fun, Versatile, Communicative -- The Absolute Best!

BOOK HER! We were searching for an MC & DJ for our wedding and were so glad we found someone who is cares about her craft and her couple. Marlene was so pleasant to work with and even went the extra mile for us when we inquired about a song alteration request. Her positive energy and passion is unmatched, and that translates to a real good time on the dance floor!! Several of our guests were still raving long after the wedding about how amazing she was and were even interested in hiring her for their own weddings. If we ever host another big event, Marlene would without a doubt be our go-to -- she just gets it.

The Perfect Vibe for the Perfect Day!

Marlene was great in every step of the process for our wedding day! Our music selections for each part of the cocktail hour and reception were thoughtfully chosen as she made sure every selection was aligned with our preferences. Our guests couldn’t have enjoyed the reception enough and raved about how she kept the energy going all night! The uplights included in our package saved us some time in getting a separate lighting vendor as well.

DJ Lady FX made our wedding a party!

Marlene’s talent for setting the perfect mood and getting everyone on the dance floor truly made our wedding unforgettable.  
From the moment the ceremony started, Marlene had everything under control. The music was perfectly timed and beautifully selected, creating a romantic and joyful atmosphere. During the cocktail hour and dinner, the background music was tasteful and set the right tone, allowing everyone to relax and enjoy the evening.  
When it came time to dance, Marlene truly shined. She played a fantastic mix of songs that appealed to all ages and kept the dance floor packed all night long. Her ability to read the crowd and adjust the playlist accordingly was impressive. Whether it was classic hits, current favorites, or special requests, every song seemed to be just what everyone wanted to hear.  
Moreover, Marlene was professional, friendly, and incredibly easy to work with. She took the time to understand our musical preferences and incorporated them seamlessly into the evening. She also made sure to coordinate with other vendors and the event timeline, ensuring that everything flowed smoothly.  
We received countless compliments from our guests about how much fun they had and how great the music was. Marlene played a huge role in making our wedding day a success, and we couldn’t be more grateful.  
If you’re looking for a DJ who will exceed your expectations and keep the party going, look no further than DJ Lady FX. Thank you, Marlene, for making our wedding day so special!

DJ LADY FX is the best DJ I’ve ever heard at any wedding - FULL STOP. 

If you want your wedding reception to feel like a proper PARTY then look no further. Marlene/DJ Lady FX is truly the best of the best. Book her NOW because your only regret will be if you didn’t book her soon enough!!  
  
My husband and I are both musicians (violin & cello) that have been hired to play at HUNDREDS of weddings and we have listened to many DJ’s and live bands throughout the years. Too often we have heard DJ’s that make the wedding feel like a lifeless corporate event or live bands that end up being hit or miss. And so when the time came to find a wedding DJ we knew we wanted to find a passionate DJ devoted to their craft, someone with the versatility to go from the quiet, thoughtful slow dances all the way to the high-energy end of the night. Marlene is all that and more!! She knows how to THROW IT DOWN and make the entire room feel the irresistible vibe to GET UP AND DANCE.   
  
When we had our first FaceTime call with Marlene, we knew she was the DJ for us. She has been collecting vinyl records for many years and is a true old-school (in the best way!) honest-to-goodness disc jockey; a skillset which is very rare to find nowadays. With her fluency she seamlessly blends modern songs and beats with throwback classics so that everybody in the crowd has something to enjoy. Marlene really made the music of our wedding reception the party of a lifetime and we are so thankful she was available! For MONTHS afterwards, our guests kept raving about how amazing Marlene was. BOOK HER NOW!!

The best of the best!!

Marlene was a true joy to work with from start to finish! She was highly organized and made sure to give us dates in advance with flexibility built in, which made planning fun and easy! She also had thorough knowledge of an outdoor venue and made sure to ask all the right questions so that we could have the best sound setup possible for the ceremony and reception. Most importantly, she is a truly talented DJ who can gauge the vibe of a crowd and make the best music choices to match personalities and setting! Marlene, thank you so much for making our wedding day soundtrack vision come true!!! Our wedding would not have been the same without your technical expertise and beautiful personality there!!

You’re missing out if you don’t book her

Marlene was incredible. She was the DJ for our destination wedding in Puerto Rico. She participated in multiple calls with my wife and I, as well as with our other vendors. During our calls, she made sure to figure out our taste for specific genres and songs and made some fantastic suggestions for the wedding ceremony and reception, even reviewing a playlist that we had put together. On calls with the other vendors, she helped coordinate the ceremony and reception with our wedding planner and the vendor who supplied some of the sound equipment. The ceremony and reception were seamless thanks to everything she did for us. She went above and beyond. The song selection and transitions were on point. Everyone in attendance had a memorable time. We can’t thank her enough. 10 out of 5 stars.

Hire this dj!

If you want a great party then you NEED to hire Marlene! I am a fellow wedding vendor, and I met Marlene while working with her. I LOVED her style, and the way she would feel out the crowd. She also really listens to her clients needs. My wife and I wanted a Hispanic/Miami vibe, and she brought the house down. We are still getting told that our wedding was the best party ever!  
  
If you are at all concerned about your DJ, and whether or not the music will be amazing, HIRE MARLENE! Seriously. The best decision we made!
