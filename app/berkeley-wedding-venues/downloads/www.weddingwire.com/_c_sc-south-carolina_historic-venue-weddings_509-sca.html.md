From the moment we first visited Magnolia Gardens, we knew it was something special. Natasha was so warm and welcoming, instantly making us feel at ease and excited about the possibility of hosting our wedding there. Our wedding day at Magnolia Gardens was truly a dream. The grounds were absolutely stunning, and we loved having the entire property to ourselves—it made the day feel so personal and relaxed. Our guests were blown away by the beauty of the venue, and our photos turned out better than we ever imagined. Magnolia Gardens also holds a special place in my heart, as it was meaningful to my late father. I truly can’t imagine getting married anywhere else. Thank you for helping make our day so unforgettable—we highly recommend this venue to any couple looking for something truly magical.

The William Aiken House is, without a doubt, the most elegant, unique, and vintage wedding venue we've ever experienced. From the moment we stepped inside, we knew we had chosen the perfect place for our special day. The historic charm and sophisticated ambiance created the most enchanting atmosphere that set the tone for an unforgettable celebration. The food was absolutely exceptional—our guests continue to rave about it, calling it the best wedding food they've ever had. Honestly, I wish they had a restaurant because I still think about how delicious every bite was! The culinary team truly outdid themselves, crafting a menu that was as delightful as it was memorable. Kelly was a tremendous help throughout the entire planning process. Her expert guidance and thoughtful advice made all the difference, helping us make choices that brought our vision to life. She went above and beyond to ensure every detail was just right, and on the day of our wedding, the service was nothing short of superb. The staff at The William Aiken House made everything run so smoothly that we were able to simply enjoy the moment without a worry in the world. The day felt flawless, and that was all thanks to their incredible dedication. Our wedding at The William Aiken House truly exceeded our expectations. Every one of our guests was in awe of the venue's beauty, and they couldn't stop talking about the top-notch service and, of course, the phenomenal food. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to celebrate our love!

Everything was absolute perfection, which is impressive because it down poured all morning. The team was flexible and ready to help with anything needed. We were given a wide range of time for our rehearsal the day before, the team was always responsive with any questions and helpful with a list of suggestions. Everyone in attendance said it was beautiful and they had never been to a place like Legare. Vendors had positive reviews as well. The team made us feel welcome and accommodated. They do have a social media so you can check out other weddings and ideas which is awesome!

I recently had the pleasure of working with 1208 Washington Place for my wedding, and I couldn't be happier with the experience. From start to finish, they were professional, attentive, and went above and beyond to make our day truly special. First and foremost, the communication was outstanding. They were prompt in responding to emails and always made themselves available to answer any questions or concerns we had. This level of responsiveness really put our minds at ease during the planning process. I cannot recommend 1208 Washington Place highly enough. If you're looking for a wedding venue who will truly go the extra mile to make your day unforgettable, look no further. Working with 1208 Washington and their staff was one of the best decisions we made during our wedding planning process, and I am so grateful for their hard work and dedication.

Hands down the BEST decision we made was getting married at Magnolia Manor!! The whole estate is beyond beautiful, & the vine-covered chapel is breathtaking! Our entire wedding party plus out of town family all had such a great stay at the Manor over the weekend, she even put our favorite drinks in the fridge & Emily’s flowers were GORGEOUS! Mary went above & beyond for us to make sure that our entire wedding weekend was perfect. Her, Emily & all of the vendors were so involved & helpful, I didn’t have to worry about a single thing for our rehearsal dinner or on our big day, other than walking down the aisle! I couldn’t have dreamed of it going as great as it did & thanks to Mary, I just had the best experience from the beginning of planning to even after the wedding!! I am beyond grateful for Magnolia Manor & the entire crew there!! Thank y’all so much!! 💕

After touring close to 50 venues across the US, Rachel Hopkins the Sales Manager we had worked with, made it an easy decision for us! We selected The William Aiken House (which was unknowingly my first ever pin on Pinterest for a wedding venue) for our ceremony/cocktail hour/dinner, American Theater for our dancing/after party and Parcel32 for our rehearsal dinner/welcome gathering. Rachel was easily the best we worked with throughout our venue search and is a genuinely kind hearted individual! We also worked with Becky Kearns, who was also an absolute joy work with! The two of them were very accommodating and easy to work with as they shaped the various options for the venues, catering, and other items. Throughout the planning process the two of them and PPHG were very professional and thoughtful with each step. We felt comfortable with them along the way and they made it easy to trust them in all ways. Abigail Roderick, Director of Events, was also fantastic in every way and we really enjoyed her flexibility in all areas of planning, and the tasting with her! We also worked with the amazing Rachel Starling for our rehearsal dinner and welcome party at Parcel32 which would highly recommend (please see our review)! The day of staff assigned to our events surpassed all expectations and we received much praise from our guest on how wonderful the service was. The catering and drinks were also a significant highlight from the affair. The feedback from guests on how it was “the best wedding food they have had” was so wonderful. We drool thinking back on each food item and drink, and are so happy PPHG upholds such a great standard for the catering. We also were so pleased in choosing to work with Jessica the Pastry Chef for our Cake. It was so elegant and received endless compliments, and tasted delicious too! And it goes without saying, the beautiful unique venues (and photos from them) were breathtaking! To end, you would be making the best decision to work with PPHG. We are so happy and forever grateful for everything they did for us :) PPHG was wonderful to work with in every aspect! We would highly recommend anyone planning an event or wedding to work with them! They have the best venues in the United States, exquisite catering and genuinely thoughtful top notch staff.

Amy, Jacque, and their team provided excellent service. Amy was always available when I needed anything, she was very patient, and met all my requests. We met once in person and other communication was via phone, text, and email. The food was amazing. The short ribs were so tender, and there are no words to describe the bartender! We had an evening wedding reception, and I'm so glad we trusted The Brentwood Restaurant and Wine Bistro on our special day.

I had a wonderful experience working with The Cedar Room when planning my wedding. From our initial tour with Jessie, who was so enthusiastic and up for anything, to our final tasting menu touches with Samantha, who was endlessly patient and accommodating, I can't say enough kind things about this venue! They truly were the most flexible and easygoing team, yet so organized, gracious, and on top of everything. They took food allergy concerns seriously, going out of their way to speak with guests over the phone and plan a safe menu for them. And the food itself? Amazing! (The desserts especially!) As for the venue itself, The Cedar Room was perfect for our big day. We fit two bars, a band, a dance floor, and 160 guests for a seated plated dinner and it never felt crowded (or too big). I would recommend this venue for anyone accommodating a crowd and looking to eat, dance, and party the night away at their wedding!
