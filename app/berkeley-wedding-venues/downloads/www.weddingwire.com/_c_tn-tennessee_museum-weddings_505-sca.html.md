From the start, the staff at the Metal Museum were out of this world. We had a lot of hurdles as we had our wedding during the pandemic, and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. The staff helped us not only plan our wedding layout, but helped us get everything approved by the health department, worked with us on several fronts to keep people safe, and provided non-stop service during the day. The venue itself speaks for itself. It's easily one of best (if not the best) venues in Memphis. The lighting was excellent, the party afterwards was amazing, and there's so much space to accommodate a large or small group. It was the night of our lives, and we can't thank the Metal Museum enough. If you work with Madison, you're working with THE BEST!

Graceland’s Chapel in the Woods was the perfect venue for our vow renewal. The setting is stunning, both inside and out. It's charming, elegant, and nestled in a small wooded area, creating the perfect backdrop. Its location is also incredibly convenient, just a short path from the Graceland Guest House, which made it easy for us and our guests to get to and from the event. What truly made the experience exceptional was our coordinator, Jakyra. She was absolutely amazing—responsive, positive, helpful, and well-organized. From the initial planning stages to the day of the event, she made everything seamless and stress-free. Jakyra ensured that every detail was attended to and went out of her way to make us feel special. Her warmth and professionalism were noticed not just by us, but also by our guests, who repeatedly mentioned how well everything was coordinated. Graceland’s Chapel in the Woods is an unforgettable choice for a special day. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate such an important moment!

We loved hosting our wedding reception at the Brooks in April 2024! The venue is stunning and elegant. We loved the indoor and outdoor spaces available to us, especially the tented patio and Holly Court. Katie, the events manager, was extremely responsive, professional, and overall a joy to work with throughout the planning process. I appreciated the recommended vendors list that the Brooks provides, and they were also very flexible in accommodating our requests to work with other vendors. You will not be disappointed if you book this venue!

The Pink Palace was on the higher end of our venue budget, but I am very happy we used them. If you are looking for a venue that allows for both a ceremony and a reception, this is your spot. We used it for a reception only so I didn’t get to make use of the beautiful bridal suite but the beauty and spaciousness of the venue was worth it. Our guests still comment on it even a year later. In addition, they allow you to select your own caterer and bring in your own alcohol, which will save you money. I was very pleased with the coordination both before and during our wedding day. The responsiveness was above average, which will pay off in stress reduction.

We were actually the first couple to get married at this museum. We actually got married in one of the displays of the museum! It was amazing. They were so nice in working with me on everything and had a ton of ideas and suggestion for me. Myra was very helpful and Jeremy, who controlled the music for us, was awesome! It was truly a once in a lifetime event! Oh! and it only cost about $800 for us to have 50 guests!

This is an excellent venue. The hall had several options available depending on the space needed. There was also a kitchen on site that could be used and we were allowed to bring our own food. Alcohol is allowed however you will need to go through the proper licenses to be able to serve it as well as the hall requires you to hire security if alcohol is served. Over all this is a wonderful place to host any big event.

We loved having our wedding here. The venue was beautiful and the staff were great. We were going to have it out in the field but due to possible rain we moved it to the covered porch. The staff was so helpful and had no problem with us moving.

This was the perfect venue! Mark and his team couldnt have done a better job! Its basically a blank space so you will need to create it on your own- so its great when you want a "one of a kind" wedding
