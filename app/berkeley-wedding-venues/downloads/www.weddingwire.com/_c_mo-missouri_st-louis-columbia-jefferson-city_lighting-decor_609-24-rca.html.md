I would highly recommend this company. They did a great job and went above and beyond to make sure it was exactly what I was envisioning. When the venue changed things last minute they worked hard to make sure everything got set up. I greatly appreciated this company! They were the best!!

Exclusive was so great to work with for our wedding. We ended up renting beautiful wood farmhouse tables to use at our reception through them and it elevated the space so much. There was so much emailing back and forth with them to see about what options they had for all types of small things that I was brainstorming throughout the planning process. They were always so responsive and patient with me as I was making final decisions on everything. I would definitely recommend them for all wedding and event rental needs!
