Fairlane station was a beautiful venue. I’m an artist so, I don’t say this lightly. We had an end of summer wedding and the greenery had grown so far over the hanging lights that it dropped drown outside where we had he ceremony. The industrial feel is a nice mix of simplicity and elegance. But the space was also very personal. It accommodates us well but was so so big as to make it feel empty. We went a few farmhouse tables from them too and chairs.

I loved photographing at the Venue at Oakdale. The chapel and reception hall are simply stunning and beautifully designed, still allowing brides to decorate to their taste. In addition to that, there are so many spots outside for photos. I had a wonderful working relationship with Carol, who coordinated the wedding. She was professional and had years of experience that showed throughout the day. Can’t wait to photograph a wedding there again!!!

It was a fantastic place! We rented out the pavilion and that's where we had both the ceremony and the reception. It turned out so amazing.

Barbara made my COVID, last minute, replanned small wedding everything I could’ve dreamed of! Despite the obstacles of having to cancel a Colorado elopement last minute, the lodge was very accommodating to make sure our day still went on. I felt safe and didn’t have to lift a finger. I couldn’t say enough kind things!

I can not say enough kind words about the staff and beauty of this venue. My brother-n-law just got married yesterday and the family and guests were very pleased. Bridal area has plenty of space, on site cabins for immediate family are incredibly convenient and beautiful, staff became friends by the end of the weekend, gazebo with swing seats and fire center for s’mores. We sat out here the morning of with coffee and just enjoyed the mesmerizing view. April wedding at 72° was perfect! Reba handles every detail and they all treat you like royalty. The owners genuinely care about your event and are just as excited as your family to witness the wedding. This venue has every style of colors and decor you can imagine. The space has endless options of how you can set it up and they make it super easy to make all your selections from decor to food. Outside catering is allowed if you prefer. They handle all the details so you can just enjoy! Highly recommend!
