We had our April wedding at Thomas Fogarty and it was perfect! The views are incredible! I also loved the site for the ceremony on the grass and then the open pavillion for dinner with an inside area for dancing. The staff was also professional, responsive, and very kind. Would highly recommend!

We stayed at Pullman the night before our wedding. When we first booke the hotel, we didn't know that it was dog-friendly. We last-minute decided to add our pup to our wedding and was pleasantly surprised when we realized that it was a dog-friendly hotel! The bridal party had two rooms (the boys got a smaller room) and we requested that they be close to each other, but we all spent most of our time in the suite. We had a great time together. The suite was spacious enough for us to do all our hair and makeup there. It was also super beautiful and a great backdrop for our preparation pictures. There were also two weddings going on downstairs. We could hear and see bits and pieces of it. It looked amazing!
