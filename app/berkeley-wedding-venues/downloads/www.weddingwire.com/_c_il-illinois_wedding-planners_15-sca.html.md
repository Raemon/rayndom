Beth G at Everlasting Impressions took over as my day of coordinator at the most perfect time in wedding planning. The last month before the wedding and wedding weekend was a breeze thanks to her expertise and commitment to making sure my wedding day dreams became a reality! From having extremely helpful and organized wedding planning resources to making sure my vendors were working towards the same goal, she is someone you absolutely need on your side for your wedding. Myself and my family truly got to enjoy our weekend!

Kristin and John made simple the long, arduous process of planning and executing a wedding. They were incredibly responsive and flexible in the months leading up to the wedding and on the day of, we were able to count on them to keep the whole ceremony going smoothly. While all brides and grooms are kept busy during the wedding, Kristin went out of her way to make sure we were taken care of and had some time to ourselves in the midst of all the chaos. The day went perfectly in part because Kristin and John helped us stay on top of everything!

There aren't enough words to express just how thankful we are for Gina. Well beyond managing the details of the day, keeping the timeline, and facilitating vendor communication and organization leading up to our wedding-as a bride, I felt a sense of security knowing that Gina had our backs throughout the day. We planned and payed for our whole wedding ourselves and with Gina's help as our day of coordinator, our day was better than we ever could have imagined. Everything that Gina and her associate did to set up was absolutely stunning and she thought of everything. She was so calm and collected and that was priceless, as it helped keep me grounded. She was detailed oriented and made sure everything was set up to our liking. My husband and I both haven't stopped telling each other that hiring Gina was the best decision we made in planning since the day we first spoke to her. We felt an immense weight lifted off our shoulders since the day we hired her and the impact she had on our big day was massive. Would highly highly recommend!

If you are looking for the right wedding planner, your search should end with this review. We cannot say enough good things about Camille and her team, but we will do our best here. We were in a unique situation of putting together our wedding in roughly three months due to family health reasons, and Camille played an enormous role in making our wedding a success. Camille was on top of every detail and was involved every step of the way. She was always there to give us advice when we had questions or weren't sure what to do. She provided a thorough timeline and kept all the trains moving on time. She also connected with our vendors to coordinate deliveries and timing. Everything you could want in a planner, Camille and her team provided. She made a stressful few months feel much more manageable and it all went off without a hitch. Thank you Camille!

As a fellow event industry professional, when it came to planning my own wedding, there was only one group I would hire and Anticipation Events is it! With mind blowing combined years of event planning, design and execution, there is no better choice! From the initial inquiry email, Elizabeth and Emma were nothing but kind, patient, reassuring and efficient. Consummate professionalism through and through! They helped us flush out ideas and guided us through each step. I was able to switch mindsets from event director to bride with confidence and ease. The team was available for random texts, multiple emails and calls whenever needed. Their organizational tools leading up to the day were so helpful to keep us on track and they handled all necessary communications with our vendors and venue with grace and aplomb. We had a great deal of decor that we collected ourselves and AE came to our house to gather it all ahead of the big day and handled all set up where needed. This aspect was an incredible relief and a huge added value that made our day even more special! One the day, Emma and team were so responsive and able to pivot on a dime when necessary. They even handled wayward family members with tact and professionalism, leading with hospitality at every turn. AE was ready with a kit of items we never thought we would need, which all came in handy! Even when my beloved Groom left his reception tux jacket at the hotel, AE was able to retrieve it , and returned right on time for outfit changes! Not a beat was missed. Anticipation Events were there for and did everything that I would have done but better and before we knew we even needed it, more than living up to their name. If I could elect Anticipation Events for President, I would. Full stop.

This team was such a pleasure to work with! As a photographer I’m able to almost go on autopilot when working with Shannon Gail because I know they are on top of every small detail! From the flatlay, to the dress, the fine details of the timeline, etc. This might be an overstatement, but it also seems that they has a huge following from word of mouth and not from a bunch of mindless advertising. That tells me one thing that is most important for any planner to have with couples…Trust! Every couple knows undoubtedly that their day is in great hands with the Shannon Gail team! If I had money on the line I would put my money on them any day of the weekend!

Me and my husband selected Vowed to You as our day of coordinator. The only thing we would change is if we could rewind time and have Kyna be our wedding planner. From day one Kyna paid attention to detail and gave amazing recommendations. Our other wedding vendors had some hiccups setting up and I knew nothing of it because Kyna handled everything based on conversations we previously had about our vision. She ensured everything we needed throughout the day and night was taken care of.

We cannot say enough good things about LOLA!! We booked the “Last Minute LOLA” package and we worked with Sanja Dimitrijevic through the last few months of our wedding planning. She exceeded all of our expectations and really helped to make our wedding day the most perfect day. The whole planning process with her was so fun and we felt really prepared in the week leading up our wedding. No ask was too much and she met with us countless times to make sure all of the details were accounted for. On the day of the wedding, she was on top of everything and did so much behind the scenes work. She took all of the stress out of the day which was exactly what we were hoping for! Booking with LOLA was one our best investments during our wedding planning process and we can’t recommend Sanja enough!!

My husband and I knew we needed someone to keep us on track and organized for our big day. We were so grateful for Charlene and her team for being there for us! We had their help for Wedding Day Coordination and Production, and she started helping us two months in advance, which was absolutely needed. Two months before the event, she started communicating and coordinating with all of our vendors, which took a lot of work off of our plates. Charlene thought of all those details I would've probably forgotten until that day, and she helped us to brainstorm ideas for aspects of our wedding we hadn't yet decided on. She was flexible with meeting times, which was absolutely essential for our job schedules. On the day of our wedding, Charlene and her team were organized, calm and relaxing: exactly what we needed. I wouldn't recommend anyone else!
