⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ We had an amazing experience with this DJ service! The music selection was perfect, the transitions were smooth, and the energy stayed high all night. They were professional, punctual, and really listened to what we wanted. Our guests couldn’t stop dancing, and we received so many compliments about the music. Highly recommend for any event!

I genuinely cannot say enough good things about Allegro. From start to finish, Dori and her staff were completely dedicated to making my day as special as possible. I asked a lot of questions along the way, but they were equally as forthcoming with information. I never felt lost in the planning process, or like I was unsure what our next steps were. A lot of wedding service planning packets can be kind of vague or leave you confused about what information to put down, but Allegro's planning packet is so simple and straightforward; it takes a lot of the pressure off, and makes the planning process feel easy and manageable! I also HAVE to emphasize how patient and caring Dori and her staff were as I had to cancel my wedding date in 2021, and reschedule for 2022. I know so many COVID brides who were completely ghosted or put out by their wedding vendors during the pandemic, but Allegro was incredibly compassionate and accommodating, despite the fact that I'm sure the pandemic was hard on them as well. Our reception was absolutely perfect! Jason and his assistant were a dream team, and never left me wondering what we were supposed to do the day of! Their announcement timing for different events throughout the night was perfect. They blended a great amount of party music to keep the guests dancing all night long with my and my husband's favorite songs flawlessly. Due to some last minute antics on the part of the reception venue at the end of the of the night, my husband and I had to miss our last dance, but when my husband asked if they could replay the song, they were happy to do so, which was extremely kind considering the long night of work they'd already done. I absolutely made sure to leave a tip! Seriously, if you're still thinking about who you should go with for your celebration, just pick Allegro! I couldn't have asked for a better experience! Thank you Allegro! You made planning my wedding reception a joy!

Can't say enough good things. The entire team is great and our DJ, Brian, was the absolute man. He brought the energy, knew how to make the night go smoothly, and made sure that everyone was having a great time. Super adaptable and communicative, thanks to the entire team at Rockstar!

Logan was absolutley amazing. He hands down, single handedly made our wedding the best day of our lives. He was our number one cheerleader from the first time we talked to the very last second of the night. The amount of complements we got on our wedding was insane and 95% of them mentioned it wouldn't have been as amazing without Logan. He got out on the dancefloor and got groovy with us, and he turned the place into a complete rave by the end of the night. Our words alone could not express our gratitude for Logan. He made us feel special and he created such a fun and uplifting atmosphere for everyone. We 10000/10 recommend him for any and all events. XOXO- The Krings

TKO was great to work with. Scott was very responsive and answered every question that we had leading up to our wedding. Tevin and Ed were our DJs and they were awesome! They did a great job of mixing songs and keeping the energy up and the dance floor popping. They provided the music for our ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception as well as expediting the reception, and it all went flawlessly. The online planning tool was extremely helpful and easy. We would definitely recommend TKO for any event!

Working with Elite Sounds was a very smooth and enjoyable experience during an otherwise stressful wedding planning time. More specifically, DJ Tim was an incredible and integral part to making our wedding celebrations SO amazing. The party and fun was effortless with the music he played and vibes he brought. He was also so awesome to work with when doing pre-wedding discussions. He was so encouraging about our vision and any ideas we had, and executed everything with no problems at all. We would book Tim Gibson again in a heartbeat if we were to plan a wedding all over again!

Book him! My husband and I have been to a billion weddings this year and the DJs have either made or ruined the day. CJ was such a wonderful DJ AND a master of ceremonies. As a master of ceremonies, he kept us on schedule and made sure that the whole cocktail and reception ran smoothly. As a DJ, he was able to expertly read the room, create an audible experience and keep the momentum going. CJ was exceptional at understanding what type of experience we wanted at our wedding and then staying true to that vision. One of my husband’s cousins who has downs kept asking for CJ to play Gangnam Style during the reception. This song wasn’t on our do not playlist but it also wasn’t exactly the ideal song for what we wanted. CJ could just tell that this song could be a game changer for this cousin and for that side of the family. He found us and asked us what we wanted to do and we quickly came up with a game plan. When the song came on, it was an immediate hit and my husband’s cousin and the whole family was living it up on the dance floor. It was a perfect moment of CJ knowing what we wanted from a music perspective, but also knowing when to intervene to create memorable experiences for the guests. The fact that he went the extra step to confirm with us and kept our perspective/wants top of mind showed his excellent judgement as a DJ.

Working with Complete was incredible. There's always so much hesitation and nervousness when it comes to selecting wedding vendors. I used Complete for both DJ and Photographer. Let me tell you... DJ Austin was AMAZING! Our friends and family still talk about how perfect the music and vibes were. Austin truly nailed the assignment and was extremely prepared. Great personality! Photographer Haley Barks was also so wonderful!! The photos she captured, we will cherish forever! She had lots of ideas on group shots and husband/wife poses. She led the group seamlessly and kept us right on time! I would highly recommend Complete Weddings and Events to anyone! Thank you all for making our day even more special!!
