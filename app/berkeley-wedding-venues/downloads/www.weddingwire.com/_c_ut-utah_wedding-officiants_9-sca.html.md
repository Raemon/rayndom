Laurie was simply amazing to work with! From start to finish, she made the whole process so stress free! She took the time to get to know us and find out what made our relationship special. She did a wonderful job catering our ceremony to us and included quotes, and inspirational messages throughout. She was so open to our ideas, but she also brought her own ideas when we didn’t know what way we wanted to go. She attended our rehearsal and ran through the order and how the events would go. I would absolutely recommend her to anyone! She is extremely professional, friendly, and prompt with her communication! Thank you so much for making our day go so smoothly!

Erica was wonderful! She worked with us closely to create the perfect ceremony that was exactly what we envisioned, it was short but personal and sweet. She was easy to communicate with, reliable and very organized. She even came the day before for our rehearsal. Thank you Erica!

Laura was amazing!!!! I will forever recommend her. She took all the information we had and put it perfectly into words. I can not thank her enough! Hiring someone you don’t know to officiate your ceremony may seem nerve wracking, but I promise you, Laura is the absolute best person you can go with! She made us feel comfortable and trustworthy from the start!!! Thank you so much Laura!!

Jamey was really amazing. He made our day so special and he really connected with us. Our ceremony was truly perfect because of him. He is an amazing guy and someone we were very lucky to have on our special day. Would highly recommend him if you want a genuine ceremony filled with love.

I cannot say enough kind words about Rev. Douglas Bethers. He went above and beyond on our wedding day and I would recommend him to anyone looking for an officiant. Doug’s ceremony was tailored to us, incorporated our special requests, and was humorous. He even surprised us by incorporating our beloved dogs into the ceremony. During our outdoor ceremony it was 9 degrees… Doug made sure that we were his number one priority. He made sure we had hand warmers and even carried and fluffed my train before my first look (I didn’t have bridesmaids). Douglas also took a significant amount of pictures that he texted to us almost immediately after the ceremony. This was amazing. I just cannot say enough good things.

My husband and I had the honor to have Jen as our officiant at our elopement at Canyonlands National Park. We contacted her with less than a month to go, but she immediately locked in and gave us a timeline and made this big task so much less overwhelming. She got to know us really well and from our first phone call we just got great vibes immediately. She kindly and patiently walked us through the process. She not only supported us, she also took a lot of the responsibilities off my plate during a very busy time. And for that, I can’t thank her enough! She took care of my florals, connected me with a makeup artist and even picked up our cake and drive it down for us! Jen performed a beautiful ceremony for us, allowing us to customize the wording to really reflect our beliefs as a couple. Jen clearly has a love and passion for officiating weddings and we felt that deeply at our elopement. We are so happy that she was apart of our special day! (Also she got there early and found some really cool selenite for us that we got to take home!!)
