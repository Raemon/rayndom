By Invitation Only was the perfect choice for everything we needed for my daughter's wedding! Starting with the help Erin gave us on choosing our invitations, I trusted her immediately for her guidance on everything else we did! Allison did a beautiful job addressing our invitations, and the entire staff made it a fun experience every time we went in the store! Little Rock is very lucky to have BIO!!!

Jennifer Smith owner of Stunique.com has an amazing business. She worked with me to create what everyone who has seen them, state are the most beautiful invitations. She also created handheld fans as programs for my wedding. The programs were designed to match my Save the Dates (also prepared by Stunique.com), and my wedding favors (also prepared by Stunique.com). Jennifer Smith is so creative and worked with my budget to prepare the perfect wedding favors. We gave out, as favors to our guests, flower bulbs in beautiful bags with a custom poem attached. Stunique.com made my wedding unforgettable. Jennifer Smith can customize anything you can think of from gifts for the wedding party, to chair covers, cake toppers, and anything else you can imagine.

Veronica created our wedding programs for us and did an incredible job! She was willing to do whatever it took for them to look perfect and they certainly were! All I had to do was send her pictures of what I liked and she made a few different designs and then from there we worked closely to get them done. She did all of the edits I asked for and did everything in a timely manner for a great price! I would recommend her to anyone looking to take some of the stress away from their big day!
