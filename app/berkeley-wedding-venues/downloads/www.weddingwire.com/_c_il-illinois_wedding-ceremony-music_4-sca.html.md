We hired Paul and Kerena to play as a guitar/cello duo for our outdoor wedding on 7/20/25 and we are so glad we did! They played a 30 minute prelude as guests were arriving and an hour after during cocktail hour. They played so beautifully and it helped create a really elevated atmosphere. The classic and contemporary music was the perfect blend to get that ambiance we dreamed of having: emotional, romantic, and fun. Paul was very professional and responsive over email leading up to our wedding day, which we really appreciated too. We 10/10 recommend Moeller Music for your wedding day!

Anna Piotrowski is professional and efficient. The process from hiring to execution for our wedding was very smooth. My guests absolutely enjoyed her performances. She's in the details to ensure she's able to deliver on the day. I'd hire her again!

Sarah went above and beyond to make our first dance song special. Not only was she willing to learn our dream song, but she also worked with us to add a personalized addition to the song. Her creativity, patience, and thoughtfulness made the process so stress free and totally worth it. Guests couldn't stop talking about it!

Michelle provided harp accompaniment to our wedding ceremony this past October and she was absolutely incredible! She learned and beautifully played a couple of songs we wanted to walk down the aisle to. Our guests were absolutely raving over her harp playing. Absolutely recommend!!

We had the quartet for our wedding on 8.23 which just so happened to be Ron's wedding anniversary! You could feel them play with love throughout the prelude, ceremony, and reception! We absolutely loved having them with us and would recommend to everyone who is looking for a quartet!

Innocenti Strings was an amazing and romantic addition to our wedding! The string trio received many compliments and did a wonderful job during our ceremony and cocktail hour. They were flexible too (as it began to rain during the ceremony) and they relocated inside, although they wished to continue playing! Communication with the company was efficient, easy, and they made us feel confident that everything was taken care of for our big day. We had an assortment of movie themed songs played, and choosing our list was very easy. Anna has even reached out multiple times to send us congratulation messages and to wish us happiness. We would HIGHLY recommend them! Don't think twice!
