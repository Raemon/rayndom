We had our small (approx. 40 guests) wedding (ceremony & dinner reception) at Robinswood House in mid September and we loved it! It was still the perfect setting for our event. Robinswood House is a hidden gem in the Greater Seattle Area! It’s right off of I90 so it was super convenient for us and our guests. The grounds are well kept and the gardens provided a gorgeous backdrop for our wedding. We didn’t need a lot of decor as the natural beauty of the place stood on its own. The house itself is well-appointed with everything needed for caterer setup and for the wedding parties to get ready. Joanna and Mike were great partners in bringing our event to life! For the ceremony, we wanted a pretty specific setup and Mike made it happen! He was meticulous with all the measuring, testing out layouts, and making adjustments to ensure that things worked in the space. Our dinner reception was also held outdoors but the PNW being what it is, the weather turned the day before and we had to make a last minute decision to get a tent. Joanna was both effective and compassionate in handling the change: she assured us that “we’re in this together” and within minutes everything was sorted out. Planning a wedding can be stressful enough so it was refreshing to work with such a capable team at Robinswood House. Highly recommend both for the venue and for the team behind it!

We had our reception at Chuckanut Bay Distillery and would highly recommend having your event here! The space is beautiful. You can see how much time and effort was put in when the space was renovated. Suzanne made the whole planning process so easy. She was very responsive, communicated clearly and never got tired of answering my emails! The actual reception was better than we had imagined. The room was set up the way we wanted. The food was delicious. The servers were great and the bartenders were awesome! Hannah did a great job making sure everything went smoothly. We highly recommend booking Chuckanut Bay Distillery for your wedding/reception.

This space was so unique. When we toured the venue it was just taken over by new owners and being renovated. Even with everything not being in place we still loved what we seen and instantly knew it was where we wanted to get married! Communication along the way was great, Jaime was helpful throughout the whole process along with everyone else that joined the team. Wedding day was the best day ever and seeing everything come together was amazing. If you’re looking for a space that’s not your typical barn this is it!

When my fiance and I went to the Marysville Wedding Show 2 years ago, we fell in love with the venue. They were great with working with us throughout the whole process. It make take a day or two to respond via email but their open houses every month were helpful as well. Would recommend to others.

Thank you for getting me in on such short notice. Your location has a breathtaking view. In addition with all that was offered with the service, this was an excellent venue through and through.

I’m currently planning my wedding with the cathedral from across the country and they have made it so easy (something you rarely hear with people planning weddings). They have an incredible list of vendors to work with but let you choose anyone so you can customize as much as you want. They’re really reasonably priced especially with all of the equipment they include (and your dollars are going towards a great mission so win-win) and it’s a gorgeous space. Could not recommend enough.

WOW - we are FLOORED at how incredible the Herban Feast/Sodo Park team was to work with. There's so much to rave about but some highlights are: \- Unbelievable planning staff. Matt Tamayo, Tayler Doffner on the Herban Feast side, as well as Rebecca Dashow and Amy Gilman on the Herban Design Studio were so incredible to work with. Every question was met with professionalism, and a "let's see how we can make it work" attitude. It was easy to trust their decisions, especially since we came in with large ideas around our guest count and complicated live music priorities :) \- Servers, bartenders, general event staff were so friendly, accessible, and accommodating \- The space is STUNNING. It was so so so helpful to have so much space and to have the upstairs for before/during to go hide away \- Holy cow they are EFFICIENT. We were really concerned about timing having such a large guest count, having some important moments near the end of the wedding, and at one point we were running 10 minutes early, I couldn't believe it. I barely even noticed the room flip from ceremony to reception, and that was a lot of moving pieces. \- Food was so delicious. They ended up catering both my bridal shower, as well as our rehearsal dinner as we came up on booking difficulties having our rehearsal dinner on Valentine's Day! Still dreaming about the crab cakes and steak with chimichurri \- We really appreciated that they were not strict on other vendors. My husband's dad wanted to make our wedding cake, we had a friend make our bridal party flowers (HDS provided the rest of the florals) and there's just not that many locations out there that are willing to work with you that much. Overall - I would recommend them to everyone, for anything. They absolutely made our day what it was, and we were both so thrilled to go into our day stress-free, deeply trusting that everything was taken care of because of the Herban Feast and Sodo Park team. We can't thank them enough

My husband and I had our wedding on the Rooftop Garden back in June 2016 and we loved it! Karen was extremely helpful during the whole process, budget was extremely important to us and while the venue itself can be a little pricey, she did everything she could to accommodate and make it reasonable for us. (We saved $300 dollars just cutting out the "Cake Cutting Fee"! ) The food is OUTSTANDING and we still to this day get compliments about the food at our wedding. The DJ was professional and played exactly what we want. The venue was clean, the staff was nice and everything was ready and done for us which made set up quick and easy. Overall, we had a very nice wedding at the Landmark and everything went just about perfect!

This is such a beautiful venue and extremely unique. The staff, especially Diana, are an absolute pleasure to work with and truly take the time to make sure your day turns out perfect. This venue comes with it all. We used linens, chairs, tables, dishes, candles, and even easels. Having so many things in one place made it extremely easy for us to set up and prepare without stress. I would 100% recommend this venue. We received so many compliments on the venue and the guests really enjoyed being somewhere with a bit of charm.
