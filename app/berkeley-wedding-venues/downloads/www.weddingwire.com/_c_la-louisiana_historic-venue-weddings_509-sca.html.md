We loved this venue for our 70 person wedding! The space was beautiful and the epitome of a New Orleans building. We had both floors and the courtyard. Our pictured turned out beautiful. The food and alcohol was excellent. They made espresso martinis and had so many different alcohol options for our guests. Linda was really great to work with and made coordinating with our vendors simple for us. Would highly recommend Swoop Duggins for a wedding or rehearsal dinner. Our out of town guests loved the building.

You must book with Capulet if you want a truly sensational ambiance, delicious food, and a world class team to support you on your wedding day for an affordable price! First off, the venue is such a vibe. The rooftop is gorgeous and the ground floor is so cute and cozy. (Especially if you have a smaller/medium sized party - we had 50 people) you can totally dress up the venue as you like, but if decor budget is something you want to save on the venue has PLENTY of charm and doesn't need much at all. The food and drinks at Capulet are incredible too! We hade the option to choose between their inhouse catering and working with a pre approved vendor and we chose to go with their in house team who let us design our own menu (yes, from scratch, whatever we wanted) and the quality was amazing! Our menu was boudin egg rolls, sesame chicken bites, and crab beignets for apps with Flank steak and chimichurri, crawfish etouffee, mac and cheese, and crispy chili Brussel sprouts for dinner and let me tell you; everyone raved about the food! A niche thing, that was really important to us, was Capulet was an incredibly inclusive environment. We had a very diverse group of people at our wedding, many of whom had never been to Louisiana and they made everyone feel at home, their staff is also diverse and we felt truly like we were being cared for by a tight nit community welcoming us to their space. I think it's easy to fall in love with what a venue has to offer, but the thing that sold us about Capulet was Steve and the staff. Steve is so attentive to you in the entire process, he responds to emails/texts/calls in what felt like 2-3 hour turn arounds, he worked with us on every detail and made sure to get us everything we needed to feel comfortable signing and we thought once we signed maybe we wouldn't hear from him again but he checked in on us, called us the day of our wedding tasting even though he wasn't managing it, and generally was invested in us as people and a couple not just as clients checking a box. We can not recommend working with Steve and the Capulet team enough! Oh and one other thing, I know all venues have lists of recommended vendors, but Capulet's list is top tier. We got 2 of our vendors from their list who were the absolute best, made our day so special and we wouldn't have found them without Capulet so hats off to them for supporting other vendors who have the same values and level of expertise as they do!

Magical, A Dream Come True, Fairy-tale Wedding!!! The Degas House, A Historic House Museum, was the perfect venue for my daughter and her husband's destination wedding. New Orleans was the perfect city for us. David, Kalin, Kathy were a complete joy to work with. The home and furnishings were exquisite. The Estelle Room was so beautiful and made their wedding day and evening very special. There was plenty of room for the bridesmaids to dress. The groom and his groomsmen stayed in a beautiful 18th century furnished parlor. The courtyard was so beautiful. I worked closely with Kalin, she helped with every small detail and made sure we had everything we needed for a perfect wedding. And the Food!! Many of our guest said the food was the best food they ever had at a wedding. Cajun/Louisiana dishes and the Pork Roast was the best I've every eaten. Ms Sharon and her staff even made fried chicken and fries for the kids before the wedding. Our every need was taken care of. And then, there was Ms Elaine, the personal attendant, she made sure we had plenty of champagne and finger foods before the wedding. Everything was Perfect!!! Thank you!!!

We have nothing but praise for Latrobe’s and an abundance of it, at that. Rylan, Millie, Hana, and the entire team are rockstars of the wedding industry. They guided us through the planning process with warmth and expertise, giving us complete confidence that our day would be perfect. As out-of-towners, we were especially grateful for how easy they made it to plan from afar without the need to enlist an outside planner. They were generous with their time, incredibly responsive, detail-oriented, and deeply knowledgeable about all things wedding-related. The venue itself is both stunning and historic, a true showstopper that requires minimal decor. The carriage house was the perfect setting for a romantic, intimate ceremony, while the main reception space easily transformed from an elegant soirée into an all-out dance party with just a change in lighting. Beyond the planning, the Latrobe’s team and day-of staff know how to execute an event. The food and drinks are phenomenal. Since everything is made onsite, we never had to worry about timing, temperature, or anything running out. Rylan was instrumental in making the day run smoothly without us ever having to take on any stress. She made it so we could be the guests of honor at our event, not the hosts. This care extended to our parents as well who had attendants making sure they had everything they needed throughout the night. Our family and friends couldn’t stop raving about how amazing the venue was and many said it was the best wedding they have ever attended. We are already trying to convince everyone in our lives to have events at Latrobe’s so we can keep returning for more top-tier parties.

I cannot recommend Napoleon House highly enough as a wedding venue! I had the pleasure of celebrating my wedding there in March, and it was an unforgettable experience. Karen and Beth, the fantastic team behind the scenes, truly made our day special. Their attention to detail and commitment to ensuring everything went smoothly was unparalleled. The food was absolutely incredible, with the prime rib being a standout dish that our guests are still raving about. The quality and flavor of the meals surpassed our expectations, and it was clear that a lot of thought and care went into the menu. Additionally, the support from the staff throughout our wedding day was unmatched. They were attentive, friendly, and genuinely invested in making our celebration perfect. If you’re considering a wedding venue, Napoleon House is the place to be!

If you are on the fence about your choice, don't be! They served a delicious meal; and Aaron is extremely receptive and attentive. They offer a high-quality array of local and upscale gourmet food options. We highly recommend him to family/friends.

Space/Venue: We got married in the “Garden Courtyard” and had our reception there as well as the Royal Room & The Bienville Ballroom. We planned it so our ceremony would be ~30 minutes before sunset and had some natural light and some from candles/string lights. The Courtyard is so dreamy! I’m so happy we had beautiful weather so we could see the romantic lights and sky above. We had ~60 people and plenty of space! The photos / 3D tour don’t do it justice. Its so much bigger and cuter IRL! The dance floor was packed, so I’d recommend not putting too much furniture (highboys/tables/chairs etc) outside. We fell in love with the space and I can’t wait to see the photos!! Also, we had a Welcome Reception & Farewell Brunch on the Conti Patio/newly renovated dining room. This was an amazing choice - the space was new, clean, and bright! The dining room area had drinks on one end and the food on the other end with tables in the middle. The outdoor area had some patio furniture and was pool-side. We even ended up taking photos there after the ceremony! Lots of open space, especially with the doors open between the dining room and the patio. ///////// Food & Drink: Chateau LeMoyne uses Messina’s Catering and Events for all of their catering — see their page for reviews. Spoiler: Chef Mark and Messina’s was really what won us over for choosing this venue! :) ///////// Planning: There was quite a bit of personnel turnover during our planning. Despite the change in people who we were working with, it was pretty seamless! ///////// People: The bridal attendant who assisted us during the wedding, Debbie, is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. She’s a pro, thats for sure! She knew what I needed before I knew. And she was a lot of fun! Again, due to turnover, we didn’t really have a relationship with folks at Chateau LeMoyne - for the most part, everyone we interacted with was from Messina’s. ///////// Hotel: The wedding reception and associated events was excellent - my ONLY hesitation in giving this a full 10/10 is the hotel and room reservation process. Booking rooms for guests wasn’t as easy as we’d expect it to be for a well-established chain like IHG/Holiday Inn. Every single guest who booked through our wedding block had an issue and I’m not exaggerating. I’m not entirely sure whether the issue was through the parent company or the hotel (IHG vs. Chateau LeMoyne). But unfortunately, Chateau LeMoyne’s Sales Coordinator who was our point-of-contact for hotel rooms wasn’t very helpful to resolve those issues. The hotel rooms were great, especially our suite above the courtyard (so big and beautiful!!), but the process to book them with the discount block rate was a challenge. ///////// Overall, such a great choice and would highly recommend them as a wedding venue!!

We had our dream wedding at Race & Religious. Having considered a variety of locations around the states, after our first walkthrough we knew that New Orleans and specifically Race was the venue for us. The space is absolutely magical; full of character, charm, and New Orleans soul. The staff was top notch and their organization and prompt communication made planning the wedding from out of state much less stressful. We’d highly recommend Race and Religious to anyone looking for a unique, intimate setting in New Orleans!

AMAZING! Courtney and Leah were absolutely exceptional and navigated tricky situations with ease. We used Courtney as our coordinator and we could not be more happy with that decision. Courtney ensured that all the details fit our vision and made everything come together perfectly. Not only that, the staff took great lengths to make sure that me and my husband were comfortable and happy. Not to mention- the house is GORGEOUS! It speaks for itself. We had many NOLA natives thank us for showing them a part of the city and its history that they had never seen before. The space is well laid out and makes everything feel much more intimate while not being cramped at all. It’s astounding that a gorgeous house with so many unique spaces, a courtyard, and a garden was so reasonably priced. My husband and I can’t stop talking about how perfect our wedding was, and it’s pretty much entirely thanks to the BK House. We highly recommend!!!
