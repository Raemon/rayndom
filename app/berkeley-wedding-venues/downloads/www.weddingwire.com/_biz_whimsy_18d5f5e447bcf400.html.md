Janet and crew were extremely helpful with my (now) husband and I when we were so clueless when it came to our invitations, programs, etc. They made the entire process so painless and even fun! We got countless compliments on our wedding invitation, reh. dinner invites and even our programs. All of our visions turned out so beautifully and none of it would have been possible without Janet's expertise. Thank you so much and we cannot wait to use you for all of our invitation needs in the future!

We had our invitations made from Apropos. Not only they arrived on time, but also they are perfect. Janet was very detail oriented and helpful. She knows everything I need to know to make my invitation appropriate and prefect.

We were so lucky to have Apropos right in our own backyard. They were willing to work with us- listen to all of our ideas- and work within our budget.   
They were prompt and helpful. Friendly and accommodating!   
One of our cards came back from the printer with a small glitch and they worked with us to fix it with speedy service and friendliness.   
We actually ended up using them for engagement party , shower, brunch and wedding invites. They also did a great job on tent cards for our reception. Loved working with Janet and Barb.  
Five stars all the way around!

Apropos is one of the best vendors I worked with. Despite being the only brick and mortar invitation store in northern Delaware with good, old-fashioned invitation books, their prices are competitive and their service is top notch. Over the course of the past year, I worked with every staff member to first put together completely custom save-the-dates, then gorgeous formal invitations with lots of little parts, and finally escort cards and thank you notes. When the vendor we were using for the invitations repeatedly made mistakes, Apropos was fantastic in staying in touch with me and the vendor to make sure we got exactly what we needed.

I worked with Janet from Apropos to assist me with my wedding invitations. I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful invitation with an affordable price. With the bride's vision in mind, Janet guides you and helps you create exactly what you're looking for. The turnover time for proofing is super fast and when I had to make a correction I got an immediate response. I couldn't have been happier with the service and the quality of the product. I've gotten many compliments!

I worked with Apropos to design and order my wedding invitations, rehearsal dinner invitations, thank you cards, and place cards. I could not have had a more positive experience. Everyone was a pleasure to work with, and I had the opportunity to review the proofs of all of my orders to confirm everything was as I expected. And indeed, everything was fantastic! I absolutely love my invitations!
