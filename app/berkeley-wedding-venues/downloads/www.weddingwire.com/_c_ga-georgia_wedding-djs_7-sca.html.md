I cannot recommend Jesse Busch and SE Events highly enough for both ceremony and reception music. From our very first meeting, I knew we were in great hands. Their online planning portal was user-friendly, detailed, and made it easy to customize our music choices. I had a few key songs in mind, but Jesse helped fill in the gaps with well-curated playlists—like the top 50, mother/son, and anniversary dance options—that made decision-making easy and enjoyable. Jesse’s expertise was especially valuable during our ceremony. We opted to use SE not just for music but for sound amplification as well. He equipped our officiant and my husband with lapel mics, which perfectly captured our vows. Our ceremony setup was long and narrow, and the added audio support ensured every guest—front row or back—heard every word clearly. What really sets Jesse apart is his responsiveness, creativity, and calm, professional presence throughout the planning process. He made us feel supported, listened to, and totally confident on the big day. SE was one of the best vendor decisions we made!

First of all, has an amazing personality and knows exactly what music the crowd wants to hear. If you want someone who will give everyone a memorable time, DJ Reddot is the man to book

Luma was absolutely perfect for our wedding! We could not ask for a better DJ! We spent hours dancing to the BEST music selection. If we could do it over again, I would choose Luma again and again. Marilyn was super communicative and made sure everything was perfect!

J&M Productions was absolutely AMAZING and truly made our wedding unforgettable. From start to finish, the entire process was so easy, stress-free, and organized. Johnny was incredible to work with, he genuinely listens. Every detail we mentioned, every preference, every timing cue was heard and executed perfectly. He made us feel confident and at ease throughout the planning process, which meant everything on the wedding day flowed seamlessly. The music was perfect, the energy was spot-on, and the transitions were smooth. He read the room so well and kept the night fun, emotional, and exactly what we envisioned. If you want a DJ who cares, communicates, and truly delivers, J&M Productions is the best choice. We couldn’t be more grateful and would recommend them 1000 times over.

From the very first song, the dance floor was completely packed. I’m not exaggerating when I say the entire room ran to the dance floor and stayed there all night. The DJ and live saxophone combo was unreal and created the most electric, fun atmosphere we could have hoped for. The music flowed perfectly, the energy never dipped, and every transition felt seamless. So many of our guests commented that it was the most fun wedding dance floor they’d ever been on. If you want a celebration where no one sits down and the party never stops, this is absolutely the team to book
