Dana Osborne was my lifesaver through this wedding planning process. As I was looking at invitations, I kept coming back to Dana Osborne designs. I finally decided to go with Dana, and she did not disappoint! I did the custom invitations and they turned out beautiful! I got so much positive feedback for my invitations. During the consultation, Dana told me to let her know if I needed any other paper products or signage for my wedding. After receiving my invitations, I asked if she could help with the welcome sign and the seating chart. We worked together designing the signs and she had a couple hiccups with the printing company she worked with. Dana was so on top of everything and made sure that everything was correct and continued to work with the printing company to make sure the issue was corrected. I also decided to ask for help with table numbers and a bar sign on shorter notice than I would have liked, and she came through with that. Everyone had such great things to say about everything Dana made for us. She was an absolute pleasure to work with and could not recommend her more!

I had the best experience with Anna Malie Designs! Andrea was able to take my vision and make it a reality. The quality of her work was incredible and she always went above and beyond when responding to my constant edits. She made a custom map brochure for our wedding weekend which was a favorite among guests and our family! Such a unique addition to our invitation suite that was uniquely ours. I’m so glad I chose Anna Malie Designs and will continue to use her for all of my paper needs into the future! Would highly recommend her for your big day!

I love my wedding invitations from Argyle Octopus! I didn't know exactly what I wanted when I came in for my initial meeting, but I described my style with Hannah and she came up with the perfect design. The process of editing the invitations was stress-free, and I always got quick responses to my emails. The final package was exactly what I wanted, and I felt great sending the invitations to my family and friends.

Mike L. was great to work with! We ordered about 200 invites and magnates, and they all turned out beautifully! I am very happy I heard about Mike at Physicians Mutual... Which apparently is not just a place for insurance! We corresponded mostly through email, and he was very patient while I made my invites, and changed them. I would definitely recommend them if you want good quality invites for much less than most other websites.
