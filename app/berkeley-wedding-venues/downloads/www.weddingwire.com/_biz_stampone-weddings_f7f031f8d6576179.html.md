All around amazing experience

My now-husband and I cannot recommend Stampone Weddings enough. Mike is simply the best and a pleasure to work with. He’s incredibly dedicated to making sure each couple gets the music experience of their dreams. Not only is he talented and versatile with music styles and vibes, but he’s also a genuinely kind person. From our very first call, we knew he was the perfect fit for us.  
  
Stampone Weddings gave us the most amazing wedding experience from beginning to end. Mike flawlessly captured the different moods we envisioned for the night from elegant cocktail and dinner vibes to an energetic, packed dance floor that went on for hours. We’ve had countless guests telling us how amazing the music was, and some even shouted from the dance floor that they needed the playlist!  
  
We also added on the photobooth package, which was a huge hit! Our guests loved taking as many photos as they wanted with tons of props. It was such a fun addition and gave everyone a little keepsake from our special day.  
  
Stampone Weddings played a huge role in bringing our wedding day vision to life and making it an unforgettable night—we couldn’t have asked for more and highly recommend.

Ballroom at the Ben 12.21.25

Stampone Weddings was 10/10 from the first meeting. We knew we wanted to choose Mike when we realized he genuinely wanted to know more about us as a couple and hear about what we envisioned for our wedding. He understood that to provide good service, he needed to make a connection and create a foundational trust- something we appreciated after multiple meetings with other vendors who made us feel like another number and a paycheck.  
  
Fast forward to wedding week, Mike was communicative and flexible with our changing reception timeline. On wedding night, he provided amazing energy, incorporated smooth transitions, and kept the dance floor busy all night. Multiple people missed the infamous dessert room at our Finley catering venue (Ballroom at the Ben) because they were too busy dancing. To sum up, Mike Stampone kept our dance floor going all night- people SPRINTED from the bar to make it to the next song.  
  
We would recommend Stampone Weddings to anyone and so would any of our 200 + guests!

Mellon Wedding!

My husband and I just used Stampone Weddings for both our DJ and our photo both in our wedding last Friday. Their DJ Joe was phenomenal in keeping the crowd up and dancing with amazing music and energy. We could not have wished for a better entertainment company; the whole process was spot on with extremely quick answers. Mike the owner was amazing to work with throughout the whole process.

An incredible DJ!

I am a wedding planner and had the pleasure of working with Stampone Weddings at a recent wedding. Mike is friendly, professional, and truly cares about making his clients happy. There was never a dull or awkward moment during the reception, and the dance floor was packed all night. I highly recommend booking with Mike!

Unforgettable Experience

From the moment we got engaged, we knew entertainment would be the most important part of our wedding, and that’s exactly why DJ Mike Stampone was the very first vendor we booked… and wow, did he exceed every expectation we had.  
Mike didn’t just DJ our wedding, he brought the energy, the vibe, and an unforgettable experience that we and our guests will talk about for years to come. People are continuing to rave about the music. The dance floor was packed the entire night, and the music was absolutely perfect for every moment, from our 90s alternative vibes for cocktail hour to the bridal party introductions. He read the room like a true professional and matched the tone of our celebration effortlessly. Not only was he amazing on the mic and behind the booth, but he also helped us secure a violinist for our ceremony last minute, which ended up being one of the most special touches of the day. That alone speaks volumes about the kind of care and attention Mike brings to every event, he goes above and beyond and made us feel like not just a client, but family. We feel so lucky to have worked with Mike and his team. His professionalism, passion, and talent made our wedding day truly one of a kind. We will 100% be recommending Stampone Weddings to every newly engaged couple and anyone planning a celebration. If you’re looking for a DJ who will make your wedding unforgettable, Mike and his team are absolutely it!!!

Wedding DJ Review 

Mike knows what he is doing. From the beginning of the planning process through the wedding, Mike made us feel extremely comfortable. My husband and I are not big music people and put our full trust into Mike and he did not disappoint. The dance floor was PACKED the entire night. Guests came up to us during and after the wedding telling us how awesome Mike was. He also transitioned from an outdoor ceremony to indoor (due to rain) in 30 minutes seamlessly. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

The BEST DJ for your Wedding

​​We had the most incredible experience working with Mike for our wedding! From our very first meeting, we instantly vibed with him. Choosing him as our DJ was one of the easiest decisions we made. Mike was incredibly responsive, friendly, and committed to bringing our vision to life throughout the planning process. He always made it clear that our priorities came first, while also offering helpful suggestions when we needed them. On our big day, Mike kept the energy high and the crowd engaged all night long- the dance floor was packed from start to finish. At one point, the floor actually split in half from all the dancing, which was a true testament to how amazing Mike was at keeping the party going! He truly understood the vibe we were going for and executed it perfectly. We can’t recommend Mike enough. He was a key part of making our wedding unforgettable.

Mike is the best!

Mike was everything we could have hoped for in a wedding DJ—organized, friendly, and full of vibrant energy that kept our entire celebration alive and unforgettable. From our first conversation to the last song of the night, Mike was professional, easy to work with, and totally in sync with what we wanted. He kept the dance floor packed all night long.  
  
He’s been the DJ for multiple weddings in our family over the years, and he’s crushed it every single time. We’re beyond excited that he’s already booked for our cousin’s wedding next year—we know they’re in for another incredible night.  
  
If you want a DJ who truly cares, reads the crowd flawlessly, and brings the party to life, Mike Stampone is your guy. We can’t recommend him enough!

5-star DJ!

We couldn't be happier with the DJ services at our wedding! From the first meeting to the final song of the night, everything was absolutely perfect.  
  
The music selection was spot-on — Mike read the room perfectly and kept the dance floor packed all night long. Our guests are still talking about how much fun they had! Our venue staff was even dancing at certain points too lol. Mike was organized, transitioned to other songs smoothly and was genuinely invested in making our wedding unforgettable. I cannot recommended him enough!
