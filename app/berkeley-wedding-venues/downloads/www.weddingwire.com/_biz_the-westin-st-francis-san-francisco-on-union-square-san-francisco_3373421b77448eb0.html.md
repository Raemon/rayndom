Westin St. Francis - Borgia and Mission Bay Room 

Prior to booking the Westin St. Francis, my partner and I searched literally all of the Bay Area to have version 2 of our wedding (version 1 was in 2020, yikes). Immediately, we were drawn to the romanticism of this location. We viewed 2-3 different rooms we could hold our 60 headcount wedding. We loved every room, but what really helped us make our decision was the Mission Bay Room on the 32nd floor of the Tower building. The view of Union Square below and the airiness of this room (floor to ceiling glass windows) literally took our breaths away. In addition to this, Jenevieve Beaulieu, the Event Manager at the Westin made further solidified our decision. Besides the amazing wedding package the Westin offers, Jenevieve was the hidden gem here. She was there for us from day 1 and took her time to answer every single question we threw at her (there were A LOT of questions). She has a certain demeanor that is very hard to find in a Event Manager. Sometimes it feels as though Event Managers can be somewhat jaded to weddings because they deal with them every week, but not Jenevieve. She really gave us the care we needed and wanted. She wore a moon necklace for us as it was mentioned in our vows and she even cried during the ceremony! What a special moment to share with someone that has been along this journey with us since the start of version 2. We cannot thank her and the staff at the Westin for all they have given us.

Very delayed review, but better late than never! Especially when I had the most dreamy wedding ever! I couldn't have asked for more from my venue, The Westin St Francis. Everything was PERFECT, beautiful decorations, delicious food, well-trained servers/bartenders, very helpful wedding coordinator! (Can't say enough thanks to Selma! She really made my wedding perfect!) I did not have to worry about one single thing throughout the whole day! No, throughout the entire week of! We had guests flying in from everywhere with their own schedule and they accommodated them flawlessly! I just can't say good happy things about the Westin St Francis! I will always have this memory of a perfect wedding because of them!

Selma and the entire Westin St Francis team were absolutely fabulous and helped us create the most beautiful wedding for our son and new daughter-in-law! Every guest at the wedding and reception remarked on the impeccable detail and the fact that it was the best wedding and reception every witnessed. From start to finish Selma was very accommodating, answering every question and providing us with experienced and honest direction. She listened carefully to our vision for the day, and recommended lighting, music and floral vendors who hit the mark with making the vision a reality. Those of you contemplating a wedding, you will be in excellent, caring hands with Selma!

Selma was truly wonderful to work with! I was one of those brides who had a million questions throughout the planning process, and she responded to each in a timely manner with lots of detail which I appreciated! The Westin was a wonderful place to get married, right in the heart of Sf. The Imperial floor is jaw-dropping stunning and Selma and her team made sure my wedding was perfect. Thank you!

We had an amazing wedding at the Westin St. Francis. The space is gorgeous, as are the linens, tables, chairs and china. It was such an easy experience working with the team at the Westin. Our site coordinator Selma Santoyo was responsive, professional, super friendly and engaging, and handled our wedding perfectly. The service was impeccable, and the food was amazing. Our guests raved about the food and the space. We highly recommend having your wedding at the Westin St Francis.

I could not have been happier with my decision to go with the Westin St. Francis for my reception! I wanted something indoor but I also didn't want it to be the typical ballroom wedding. When I saw Alexandra's on the 32nd floor I instantly fell in love! It was different from anything I had previously seen! As soon as we met with the wedding coordinator at that time, Lauren, I knew it was where I had to hold my reception! She was extremely helpful & informative & always quick to respond to any questions or concerns I had. She was very helpful when it came to choosing the other vendors and also setup the room block with discounted prices for our guests. So when I had received an email from her letting me know that she was stepping down from that position, I was definitely concerned. Thankfully as soon as I started working with the coordinator who replaced her, Selma Santoyo, all my concerns had disappeared. From the initial phone call she made to personally introduce herself, I felt at ease knowing that she would help make the rest of the process as easy as possible for us. We first met her at our menu tasting & were immediately impressed by her! She was extremely helpful with the menu selection & made great recommendations! To this day, our wedding guests are still complimenting the food, saying it was the best appetizers & dinner that they've ever had at a wedding! They also loved our signature drinks, which were also recommendations of Selma! The day of the wedding, Selma & the rest of the Westin team took care of every detail & made my husband & I, along with our guests, feel extremely special! Everything ran on schedule & our night was better than we could have ever imagined! All of our guests LOVED the hotel. We had a lot of family from out of town, & it was the most perfect location for them to truly enjoy the city. For any future brides, I would HIGHLY recommend going with the Westin & Selma! Thanks to them, our wedding was truly a dream come true!
