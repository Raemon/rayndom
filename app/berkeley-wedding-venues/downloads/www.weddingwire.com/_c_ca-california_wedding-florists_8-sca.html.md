This is a long overdue review (sorry Kerim!!). 05.01.2022 was the best day ever and so glad Kerim and his team was part of our special day!! I’ve known Kerim for almost a decade now, from being a customer relationship to friendship. The best part of our wedding was to have Kerim and My Wedding Blooms to be in charge of our floral decorations. We could not have asked for a better florist, Kerim went above and beyond & exceeded our expectations!! WOW OH WOW! Look how beautiful and unique our wedding floral arch is for the ceremony!!! We had a crescent gold arch , which I’ve never seen at weddings before. Kerim suggested to use this unique arch instead of the traditional ones, and I’m so glad I listened to him. He has the BEST suggestions and tips. The best part was, they were able to repurpose the ceremony flowers for our sweetheart table. I showed Kerim an inspo photo of how we want our flowers to look on the sweetheart table, and he slayed it!!! I mean.. I was speechless and teary when I saw how beautiful it turned out. It was the best sweetheart table floral decorations I’ve ever seen. I can’t hype enough about Kerim and My Wedding Blooms. They are seriously the best and nicest people in the industry. Beautiful fresh flowers, reasonable price, and honest people. What more can you ask for? If you are looking for a florist for your wedding or any special occasions, look no further. My Wedding Blooms are the best!!! I highly highly recommend them!

I have worked with Vicky for years as vendor partners and selecting her as the vendor for my wedding florals was the first thing I crossed off the list. Not only is Vicky incredibly talented, she is reliable and a joy to work with! She makes the whole process so easy and fun! Not to mention my florals, MY FLORALS, they were perfect!! All of my guests raved about them and I couldn't stop smiling the whole day looking at how everything had come together. She took my vision, and ran with it, delivering florals that I dreamed of! Thank you Vicky for your amazing work and being such a huge perfect part of my big day!

My husband and I hired Citti's for our wedding. They were so sweet and made the whole ordering process very easy. They made great suggestions and were very communicative about our options. The delivery was on time and there were no hitches along the way (except for my husband and I getting hitched...bah dum bum). :) The flowers we received were absolutely gorgeous and the colors were incredible. The flowers held up throughout the entire day and continued to make us smile the week after the wedding. I was so sad when they finally all died! I would absolutely use Citti's again and am so grateful to them for helping to make our special day really beautiful.

The Flowers Etc. team was excellent and the flowers were stunning! Debbie worked with me to design florals exactly how I had envisioned. And they were able to provide a beautiful arch that took our ceremony to the next level! We got lots of compliments on the arrangements and I loved my bouquet. Highly recommend!

We had the most incredible experience working with Megan and the whole team at Mrs. Brown Floral and Event. Megan takes great detail to ensure the entire process is impressively seamless and meticulously carried out. The communication was extremely clear, perfectly timed, collaborative, and just generally kind. Megan’s passion and professional experience make her the ideal wedding planner/coordinator and florist. We were very careful when selecting our coordinator and florist because we really wanted to find someone who not only provided a fun party, but also a logistically sound ceremony and day. From our first presentation with Megan we could tell she was the superior choice. Whereas other coordinators and florists offered a quick chat and minimal info, Megan had an informative presentation and beautifully organized documents that covered the pre-wedding process, including packages, to-do’s, personalization, inspo, timelines, and so much more. Every last detail is accounted for and the pricing is fair. Our ceremony and wedding events were perfectly seamless and our reception was incredibly fun- all thanks to Megan and her team. Our advice- do not under any circumstance give your friend or family these roles, or hire a coordinator that is not invested in using the time leading up to your day to create the best day of plan. Some planners say things like “we will not talk to you until X weeks out.” Megan is not this type of person, as she truly cares about you, advocates for you from day one planning to the end of the night on your wedding, and is there to support you every step. The florals were absolutely gorgeous and perfectly cared for to ensure they looked amazing all day and night. You could just tell this team was genuinely happy to be included in our day and were there to do the best job possible. We hope you choose to trust Megan with your day!

Shae did a fantastic job bringing my wedding vision to life. The florals were absolutely perfect and I loved my bouquet more than I could've imagined. They worked so well with our venue, Talega Golf Club, that I didn't have to worry about a thing when I got there. They also setup the additional decor items, like drape for the arbor and candles for the tables, perfectly without me having to lift a finger on the big day. They were also the most reasonable quote I received for all the florals that I wanted and then some. They even threw in flowers for the cake, welcome sign, and sign in and in memory tables without any additional cost. I could not recommend them more!

Leah was an absolute pleasure to work with and understood my vision from start to finish. The flowers from my ceremony to reception including my bouquet and perfect natural arch were more beautiful than I could have ever imagined. On-site, Leah and her team had seamless execution, which meant one less thing I had to worry about as a bride. I knew I was in good hands. Thank you for making our day even more beautiful.

NONA. IS. THE. BEST. Floral Design Studio came highly recommended to me by a friend who had a great experience with them with her own wedding. I met with Nona once just prior to the pandemic to discuss my options and vision. Then COVID happened. I communicated with Nona via email throughout the remainder of the process and she was very responsive. Nona was extremely understanding and flexible when I needed to make changes to my floral order due to downsizing our wedding. Nona was so kind and said whatever we needed, she was there to help. I only showed Nona a few pictures of what I wanted but really didn't give her much direction. I trusted Nona and her talent to work her magic. And she did not disappoint! My bouquet was absolutely stunning, the centerpieces fit well with our color scheme, and the boutonnieres/corsages were all made beautifully. Everyone was very happy with the flowers. I would definitely recommend Nona and Floral Design Studio for a wedding or any special event and plan to use her services again in the future.

We loved our wedding florals from Flower Divas! The team was very friendly and made the process of deciding what we wanted very easy, despite the fact we didn't have a lot of wedding experience. On the day of the wedding, we were blown away by how beautiful our arch was and appreciated the beautiful florals at each of the tables for our reception. Thank you Flower Divas!
