## How to Choose Wedding Invitations

Your wedding invitation – whether a classic suite of formal card inserts or a more modern, web-based approach – is the first glimpse your guests will see of your wedding’s theme and style. So choose wisely! For some couples, sending out invitations can be a bit of a nerve-wracking experience, but WeddingWire is here to help.

If you're looking for a bit of inspiration, check out these [wedding invitation](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/invitations-stationery--t28 "Invitations & Stationery") ideas from our fabulous editorial team. Finding the sweet spot on when to [send wedding invitations](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/when-to-send-wedding-invitations "When to Send Wedding Invitations") depends on whether it is a hometown or destination wedding, but in either case, a simple save-the-date card can be sent as soon as the date and venue are set.

## Breaking Down Wedding Invitations

Wedding invitations can be surprisingly complicated since there is a lot of information that needs to be clearly communicated to guests. Traditionally, wedding invitations include multiple cards. While all of these cards may not apply in your unique situation, consider the following components when designing and ordering your wedding stationary.

First and foremost, you’ll want to include the actual wedding invitation card. This will feature the who, what, when and where of your special day. Make sure it has both you and your fiancé(e)'s full names, the date and time of the ceremony along with the venue’s location. If the ceremony and reception are not at the same place, you’ll also need to include reception details. A separate reception card can include this information – along with options for [wedding transportation](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-limos "Wedding Limos & Wedding Transportation") between the ceremony and reception for guests.

Next, include a [response card](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/what-to-include-rsvp-card "What to Include on an RSVP Card") and self-addressed, stamped return envelope so that your guests can easily RSVP. This card can have checked boxes for attendance and menu selections, along with blank space for personal messages. (These messages become lovely momentos!) Be sure to include a RSVP date so that you can establish an accurate headcount for your [caterers](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-caterers "Wedding Catering & Wedding Caterers").

Although optional, many guests appreciate a directions card that includes a map to your venue(s). If your ceremony and reception aren't at the same place, opt for a double sided card. Another optional insert for out-of-town guests provides information on accommodations, such as reserved [hotel blocks](https://hotelblocks.weddingwire.com/Group-Rate/ "Group Hotel Quote Request"). Alternatively, this can be listed on your wedding website.

Some modern couples opt to cut down on the number of wedding invitation inserts by adding relevant details onto their wedding website. They simply include a single additional insert with instructions on how to access this website.

Finally, wedding invitations often include both inner and outer envelopes. Outer envelopes will have guests' names and addresses, along with a return address. Some couples opt for an inner envelope to convey more traditional formality.
