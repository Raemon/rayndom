The Landmark Center was the most perfect setting for our ceremony and reception. It is incredibly beautiful, the staff is organized, professional, and easy to work with, and our guests were impressed with the beauty of the building. We used courtrooms for our get ready rooms and they were perfect for elegant family photos. The turn over time from ceremony to reception was flawless while we had cocktail hour on the 2nd floor. Honestly, we barely needed any decorations because the setting is just so wonderful. It couldn't have been a more perfect venue. The value is amazing. The whole night was simply magical. We highly recommend The Landmark Center!!!!

We got married in the Sunken Garden with our reception in the Covered Porch and absolutely loved our venue! It felt unique but accessible. It's obviously a beautiful venue and any location there is going to be gorgeous. Staff worked with us to make all aspects of our day run smoothly. The in house catering (Lancer) made decisions easy. The food, bar, wait staff, decor, and clean up are all taken care of for you.

We held our wedding reception at North Garden Theater, and I could not imagine having it anywhere else. Ryan, Tina and Grace were incredibly helpful and attentive the entire evening! We really appreciated all of the personal touches they provided, (such as custom lighting, personalized cocktails, etc...) which made our special day truly unique. Our friends and family were constantly mentioning to us how impressed they were with the venue. We cannot recommend NGT enough!

Our Oct 2024 wedding at the Bakken was a magical occasion. Chris, the events team, and everyone at the Bakken Museum helped make the ceremony and reception so special. Chris has been at the museum for ages and is attentive to detail and responds quickly as needed. His experience shows and nothing phases him. He is familiar with many vendors and runs a tight operation with enough flexibility. (He's quite good with boutonniere as well!) Our ceremony was outside in the garden followed by cocktails on the roof. We moved inside for dinner and dancing and our guests were able to explore the museum.

Couldn't have chosen better place for our ceremony and party. Everyone had something to do: kids plenty of exhibits to explore and adults neat venue with dance floor next to the waterwall. We were on a budget but this venue was worth every penny. Alexis (the event coordinator) is the sweetest and most accommodating person I've ever met. I couldn't have asked for a better service!

Our wedding reception at the Science Museum was SPECTACULAR. Leah was a tremendous help, and made sure everything went smoothly. Hire-a-host (the new catering vendor for SMM) was also phenomenal. We got many compliments on the food (it was SO good), and the layout/decorations were amazing. There were some bumps along the road (due to COVID), but in the end the Science Museum event staff delivered and made everything go smooth. We got a ton of compliments from our guests on the entire event, and we are incredibly happy we decided to choose the Science Museum. There's nothing quite like getting wedding pictures in front of the T-Rex ;)

Gorgeous venue with both indoor and outdoor ceremony options, which was important to us as we very much wanted an outdoor wedding that had a good indoor backup option. Amy M. from D’Amico was a joy to work with. She was responsive to our emails, answered all of our questions, and made sure we were getting what we requested. She did a tour with us when we were first looking at venues then another tour with me and my mom (who was from out of town) later in the planning process to help us bring the wedding vision to life. The food was excellent. We did a buffet set up, and everything was hot the entire time. Our guests were raving about the food at the wedding, and we were still getting comments on how good it was several weeks later. The team even made sure my husband and I had our own plate of the hand-passed appetizers, which was a nice touch! Highly recommend the white cake with raspberry studded white mousse - my husband and I went back for seconds and thirds later during the dancing portion of the night because it was so tasty. One thing to watch which felt a little shady - the food/beverage prices were at one price point when we initially signed our contract (about 15 months pre-wedding), but had gone up by the time we actually paid the final bill and you get stuck with the price increase. 4.5 stars.

We fell in love with the Walker Art Center as soon as we took our first tour. The spaces they have to offer simply cannot be beat. We were looking for a venue that was unique, timeless, and fully-integrated into the city of Minneapolis, to accommodate both our ceremony and reception. The Walker checked all those boxes. They helped us create a unique wedding plan that utilized multiple spaces, including a large outdoor terrace. Our spaces offered views of the sculpture garden and downtown that were stunning. They have an incredible in-house catering team that exceeded our expectations. Our tasting was easy to set up, and the chef was incredibly kind and accommodating. They were able to accommodate numerous dietary restrictions to create appetizers, salads, and dinners that got rave reviews from our guests. We cannot imagine having had our wedding anywhere else!

If you're looking for an alternative "wedding venue" we would definitely recommend Public Functionary! Especially if you're ready for a beautiful, blank slate and ready to fill it with your own projects and/or decorations, they are so accommodating, open and great to work with. We were so excited to find this space!
