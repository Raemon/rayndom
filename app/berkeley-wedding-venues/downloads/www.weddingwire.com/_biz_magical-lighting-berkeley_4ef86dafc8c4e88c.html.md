Amazing to work with!

Highly recommend Magical Lighting and would totally work with them again! We gave them a heck of a project for our Sept 2021 wedding and they knocked it out of the park. We wanted a huge light canopy over our 50ft dinner reception table and a creative lighting design for our night ceremony in a redwood cathedral on a remote venue, in the middle of the redwoods, with an off-the-grid solar power energy source. Cecil is everything you want in a vendor -- professional, thorough, knowledgeable, easy to work with, reasonable/fair on the budget, and communicative. He did the site visit, spoke with the venue owners to discuss energy/power needs, and asked all the questions I wouldn't know to ask. His team came the day before to set up (so they could see the finished product at night) and they must have worked 12 hours with the install - incredible attention to detail and made sure everything was safe and worked. It was epic and, of course, magical :)

Hiring Eddy for our wedding was one of the best decisions we made in planning the event, as he went above and beyond in handling a complex job and making our wedding a beautiful, well-lit evening. We held our wedding in the middle of a field in the effectively the middle of nowhere in rural California, with no access to electricity, infrastructure, etc. Eddy not only built a series of poles and other infrastructure needed to light the reception, he also helped organize our power needs, which was outside of his job requirements. He helped us rent a large generator, retrieved the machine, set it up and worked with our band to ensure we would have enough power for them. And beyond all that, he created beautiful lighting along a walking path, above our reception, in little nooks and crannies and highlighting a tree 100 yards away where we got married. And through it all he had a terrific attitude. We highly recommend Eddy and Magical Lighting!

We used Magical Lighting for our wedding in September 2013 and they were wonderful to work with. Their prices were very reasonable and they made great suggestions based on the venue. My husband and I thought lighting our venue would make a great impression on our guests, but we were completely blown away by the overall transformation! Hiring Eddy was the best decision we made, his work made the night! Everyone complimented us on how amazing our venue looked.

I spent a really long time looking around for lighting for our wedding in our budget and I am so happy I found Magical Lighting Design. Eddy and his team were amazing! We got married at the Admiral's Mansion at Mare Island, Vallejo, CA and the whole event took place outside so I knew I needed lighting but I wanted it to be romantic. The bistro string lighting and up lighting he did for some of the trees looked beautiful. Exactly what I had envisioned. Eddy was flexible and accommodating with meeting with us beforehand to walk through the venue and with our payment schedule. Everything was great and if you are stressed about finding a lighting person, stress no more, Magical Lighting Design is your answer.

We had a wonderful experience with Magical Lighting. Eddy helped turn our reception venue into a beautiful event! He was easy to work with and had great lighting equipment to make all our ideas come to life. He has a great artistic eye for how the lighting should be setup. Eddy was very reliable and our event had no lighting/electrical problems at all. We would highly recommend Magical Lighting for any event.

Right from our first meeting with Eddy we knew he was going to do an amazing job with the lighting for our reception and he did not disappoint. Magical Lighting took care of all the spot lighting and the gobo lighting for our reception. We also had a personalized gobo design made and had it shine on the dance floor. From meeting us before our wedding to plan the lighting to helping us make our custom gobo, Eddy was on top of it and made sure everything was going to be perfect on our wedding day. It turned out absolutely amazing and many of our guests commented on how impressed they were with the lighting and ambiance. They all said it was the funnest wedding they have ever attended.

As a Mother-of-the-Bride, Magical Lighting came from a referral from a Wedding Faire.   
Our event was an outdoor wedding reception for 150 peo. lasting into the evening.  
We had never done lighting for an event before, and he came thru as knowledgeable, humble, willing to work, and knew what to do to make things work. He suggested a few cool things we hadn't thought of, which were really nice additions to our reception.  
We had an outdoor patio at a bay area restaurant. He had everything it took to get the job done, was always very pleasant and professional, on time, and kept his word.  
Even at the last minute when the restaurant changed their schedule with his installation time, and he had less time to set up, he adapted to the potential stress with no complaints and did what he had to to get the job done for us. I thanked God for Magical Lighting. It brought great light to our reception.

Eddy at Magical Lighting did a fantastic job to transform what would've been a very corporate looking space into a classy and elegant wedding venue-- my mind was blown by how gorgeous everything looked when my new hubby and I first entered the ballroom! He was very helpful and proactive throughout the wedding planning process. We were going for a romantic candle-lit feel, and he gave great recommendations that made the lighting truly beautiful and even better than what I had ever imagined. Thanks for making our day that much more special!

Magical Lighting provided the lighting for our reception and it was amazing! They were only given an hour and a half to string hundreds of lights and they made it happen seamlessly and it looked beautiful. They were able to turn a somewhat drab hotel conference room into a great reception venue. My husband was amazed at the transformation.
