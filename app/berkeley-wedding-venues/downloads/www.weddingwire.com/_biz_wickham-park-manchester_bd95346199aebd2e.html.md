Had the best wedding!

We absolutely loved having our wedding at Wickham Park in the Emerald Room. All of the staff were amazing and so easy to work with. Diana was such a tremendous help throughout the entire process. Our pictures came out amazing with the different backgrounds throughout the area too. I highly recommend this place.

Beautiful Ceremony Space

I had my wedding ceremony at Wickham Park, specifically the English Gardens. It was absolutely STUNNING for our ceremony, with the variety of greens and blooming flowers. The space is perfect for a ceremony as it is secluded by tall bushes, has a large open lawn, and a beautiful gazebo. The grounds of the entire park are impeccably maintained.   
  
It was an absolute pleasure working with Wickham Park, specifically Diana as she made the process very easy and was very responsive and helpful with any question. They set up the tent and number of chairs we needed.   
  
We highly recommend the space if you want an outdoor garden ceremony! Our guests LOVED the space and it was absolutely perfect for what we were envisioning for our ceremony!

Beautiful wedding

We just had our wedding on 9/23/23 and it was amazing and beautiful. The staff was so attentive to ourselves as the bride and groom, the guests, and every detail. They made sure to keep unwelcome guests (people and animals out of the wedding). The wedding was able to be held outside and the reception was wonderful with a cozy atmosphere would recommend to any bride and groom that would like a wonderful wedding with amazing staff. We worked with Diana who is amazing and would recommend her 10/10. The only issue is the tent had some holes so some of the guests had to move stay dry from the rain

The most perfect wedding day 

Sarah at Wickham park is the absolute best!! She was there for me every step of the way. Quick to respond to my emails. She made things super easy and made sure everything went smooth not only on the big day but the days leading up to. I had a few concerns going into this as a “covid” bride but she eased my mind and she made the big day nothing less then perfect!!!!! Not to mention the ground at the cabin were BEAUTIFUL and soooo clean. 10/10 would recommend this venue

Everything we hoped for and more

When our wedding planning started back in 2018 we had the pleasure of working with Pam to plan for our Aug 2020 wedding. She was wonderful to work with. We live in California (I'm originally from CT). I would say that planning a wedding from cross country was a challenge, but honestly we were so blessed to have the most incredible vendors and venue to work with that made our experience so easy. From answering all questions we had (no matter how insignificant they may have seemed), to being very understanding in allowing us to postpone our wedding to Aug of 2021, Wickham was incredibly supportive every step of the way. We spent the last months leading up to the wedding working with Sarah who is the new event coordinator at Wickham. To say she is INCREDIBLE at her job would be an understatement. My advice to you is to take her advice in what she recommends, because she knows what she's talking about. We simply cannot put into words how grateful we were to have had such support behind our LGBTQ+ cabin wedding. It was stunning in every way. Also want to shout out to Dave who was the day of coordinator there for our event. He was wonderful! Thank you so so very much for all of your help in making our dream day come true.

Wonderful, even through tough times.

We got married at Wickham Park twice... kind of. Like so many couples, our plans to have our ceremony and reception at the park in 2020 did not go as planned. The park worked with us to allow us to split our day in half- we held our ceremony in Sept of 2020 and held our reception last month (both at the park).  
Sarah come on to the scene between the ceremony and reception. She was absolutely wonderful to work with and went above and beyond for us when we had a crises during our reception. She literally saved the day!   
The park was beautiful as always and our guests had a great time. 10/10, would get married there a 3rd time (kidding, but the park was great).

Everything I imagined 

Working with Pam was a 10/10 experience she was beyond nice and answered every question I had with quickness. The Irish garden was absolutely beautiful and meant a lot to my husbands family because his grandmother is from Ireland. I would recommend this venue to anyone especially during these crazy covid times because I felt like every standard was meant to keep my guests and my husband and I safe. Thank you again to Pam!!!!

Beautiful !

My husband and I are so glad we found Wickham Park! When our first venue fell through, I was panicked, but it ended up being a blessing because I found Wickham Park. It had everything I wanted and more. We were married at the Cabin in September and it was just magical. The view, the gardens, being able to set up lawn games, everything was perfect. The attendants were wonderful, and Pamela was so easy to work with, always available to answer my questions. My guests are still commenting on what a lovely day they had and how beautiful the Park is. I highly recommend it!

Pamela and the staff at Wickham Park have been nothing short of fabulous for every event we have had the pleasure to have served there for many years now. They are always responsive to any question or request, whether it be from us directly or from the clients we have served there. There is never a difference in service between pavilion outings or Cabin weddings, and a staff member is always around to make sure every event goes as planned, and they treat them all as if they are the only one they are hosting that day. We strongly recommend Wickham Park for your next event, and look forward to providing our services there for many years to come.
