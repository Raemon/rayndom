Beautiful work!

Indigo Envelope was the perfect choice for our invitations and paper goods! The team is so creative and incredibly responsive. We would absolutely work with them again and encourage you to hire them for your paper needs.

Choosing an exceptional stationary designer is key to setting the tone for your wedding or any event! It's the first impression that your guests will get to preview as part of your wedding planning experience. If you're looking for a unique stationary designer at a reasonable cost, choose Indigo Envelope. Since we live in the Washington DC area, we worked with Christina Headrick of the Arlington location and picked up our non-invitation products at the Durham office, close near our wedding venue. Christina by far is extremely talented and has a passion for stationary (just as much as I), except I can't design :). Together, we created a unique invitation suite using rose gold foil and selected a skyline of Durham as our focal design since we technically were having a destination wedding. She also helped brand our wedding by designing other stationary products from signage, programs, to favor tags. Oh, and did I mention that our invitation suite is the first rose gold foil featured in in the Durham office! Such an honor. We will be using Indigo Envelope for all of our stationary needs in the near future.

The great team at Indigo Envelope handled everything for my wedding, including invitations suite, table numbers, napkins, seating chart, and several other custom items. There use of BaseCamp made "meetings" easy and decisions were able to be made promptly. They had a lot of great ideas and were able to help create the look that represented my fiancé and me. We were very please with all of the printing the provided and would definitely use them again.

We LOVED Indigo Envelope! Amber and the rest of the team were so amazing to work with. My husband and I wanted personalized invitations without exceeding our budget, and Indigo Envelope was very willing to work within our budget and provide us with different options based on the vision we had for our invitation suite. I had found a few invitation suites that I liked bits and pieces of online, but I wanted a local focus for our Durham NC wedding, so I sent Amber a few ideas, we met and talked about my overall vision and Amber designed the most beautiful invitation suite for us! We heard so many times that our invitations were the most beautiful ones that our guests had ever received. One highlight in particular was that I really wanted a gold glitter bandwrap, but I was concerned about glitter falling off the paper, about the price, and about getting glitter paper that didn't look tacky. This was the first time Indigo Envelope had done a glitter bandwrap, and they did some research for us into paper quality and shades of gold. I was able to come into the office, see/feel the different options they found and pick the one I liked the most and that worked with our budget. Indigo Envelope was wonderful to work with throughout the entire process- communication was always very quick, and Amber did an amazing job taking my general vision for the look/feel of our wedding and designing invitations that fit perfectly. Indigo Envelope also designed and printed our save the dates, thank yous, programs, menus and wedding signage. We have highly recommended them to our friends, and they were one of our favorite vendors to work with.

Christina and her team are simply the best. I had been stressing out a LOT about the invitations, finding a design that was representative of us, and was within our budget. Our planner suggested Christina (who also has an office in Arlington, VA!), and she was the best thing that could have happened to us. Her eye for design, attention to detail, patience with our indecisiveness, insane organization skills, and ability to keep us on schedule - all amazing. While I cannot remember all of the great people working with her, I do also want to thank Amber for her amazing editing skills! I cannot recommend her enough for all your paper needs for your wedding - invitations, programs, table numbers, signs, thank you notes, and anything else! It was great to have our theme weaved throughout everything. You will not be disappointed!

I absolutely loved our entire experience working with Janelle from Indigo Envelope. I didn't think I cared about the paper products for our wedding and was planning on getting everything off Wedding Paper Divas, when I came across some of the Durham-specific designs that Indigo Envelope has put together for other couples and just falling in love with a save the date postcard they had. We ended up ordering invitations, thank you cards, placecards and table numbers too. The designs were beautiful (and original), communication was easy, and we loved being able to pick everything up easily when we were in Durham for other meetings. I would definitely recommend working with them on your wedding.

Working with the team at Indigo Envelope was a breeze! Amber & Janelle are absolute rock stars - always responding within 24 hours, answered every question, and willing to do whatever edits necessary (including changing the font 1000 times, taking away some of the swirls on fonts, and creating a map from scratch). With all that, the invitations were ready to go in less than a month and all our wedding guests love them. 10/10 would work with them again.

Indigo Envelope did an amazing job with our invitations and our programs for our wedding. Christina was very meticulous with her work and made sure everything was perfect. She was also really great about rushing anything we needed done quickly. We couldn't have asked for anything better!

I booked Indigo Envelope for our wedding invites after admiring my sister-in-law's wedding invitations, which were also done by Indigo. I was thrilled with them from day one - they were so easy to work with. Everything went through an online service called Basecamp, which made communication and design incredibly easy. We enjoyed meeting with them in person, and working to update the colors, font, and text on an older invite design so that it was personalized but still incredibly reasonably priced! Amber was always incredibly responsive to my emails and made sure that it was exactly what I wanted. Their work is so beautiful, and the invitation turned out perfectly. They even gave me a sixpence to wear in my shoe for the ceremony as a little favor - so sweet. I would highly recommend them!!!!
