They was wonderful from beginning to end. I ended up starting my ceremony an hour late and I was stressing and they was like everything is fine. They provided great food and bar service. They help make sure that everything ran smoothly. I really appreciate their help

Cassie was great! She was very flexible and frequently sent me an updated list of guests registered to stay at the hotel. She was very professional and courteous. She was a little difficult to get a hold of, but fortunately, it didn't effect our guests reservations.

Ardenwood Farms was a beautiful venue for our wedding in September- perfect weather, the grounds were well maintained and there were even baby peacocks! But what set this venue apart for my husband and I was the dream team that made our wedding so seamless. Claire, Stephanie and Lindsey are not only incredibly sweet, responsive and organized, but they executed our day to perfection. They somehow managed to keep all the details straight, even when I changed my mind several times. They even went through the buffet line and brought the food to us so we could have a chance to sit and eat! The venue even makes it simple with so many aspects that you can rent: table numbers, heaters, lawn games, etc. It made wedding planning significantly less stressful, and they are happy to make recommendations when you get stuck. I could not recommend this venue more! Everyone raved about how perfect it was.

We had our wedding here and it was absolutely perfect. The venue itself is stunning, but what truly made the experience exceptional was the staff. From day one, they were organized, thoughtful, and genuinely cared about making our day stress-free. Every little detail went off without a hitch—timing, setup, vendor coordination, everything. We never felt rushed, and every time we had a question or a small request, someone was already on it before we even had to ask twice. On the day of the wedding, they kept everything moving so smoothly behind the scenes that we could just focus on enjoying the moment. We felt fully taken care of, and so did our families and guests. We couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out. Truly unforgettable.
