I cannot say enough about the staff of the Mob Museum and how amazing they were from start to finish. They were responsive from the get go and that never wavered. They helped make the day seamless and fun. Their attention to detail was top notch! The minister took the time to meet with my husband and I separately to learn about us to make our ceremony unique to us. We couldn’t have asked for it to go better. Having a secret room to our party after was elegantly decorated and a nod to the mob. The food and drinks..WOW! Delicious and no complaints at all! We are so glad we booked our small wedding here. Was affordable and you even get to take pictures and tour the museum with your guests. Highly recommend!

Great venue! We had the wedding in their adorable little one room school house and the had the reception across the street on the top floor of the museum. It was perfect for our small wedding!

We had our wedding upstairs at the museum and it was the best day ever. The views of Reno are beautiful from the rooftop where we did the ceremony. The reception room is also wonderful. The catering and bar service were great, and Nikki was amazing to work with and plan the whole thing. They were also super flexible and easy to work with when we had to postpone for a year because of COVID. The museum made our wedding day perfect!
