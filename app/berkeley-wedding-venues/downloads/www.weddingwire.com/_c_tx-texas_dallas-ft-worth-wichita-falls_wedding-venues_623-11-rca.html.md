Miranda and Amanda were so helpful in preparing our dream wedding at The Springs in Arlington. Their kind reminders for important tasks and deadlines helped us in the midst of all the planning and their support and genuine desire to make this a beautiful for moment for us stood out. The venue itself was wonderful. Easy to locate and get to, large halls, so many spots for beautiful photos. While on the highway, it still felt secluded. Thank you for making this a spectacular wedding!

Rachel and Pepi did a phenomenal job as wedding coordinators. They helped us out through the process of booking with them and making sure we got the wedding we wanted within our budget. The moment my now husband and I walked into the venue, we knew that this is where we wanted to have our wedding. The inside rooms are beautiful and spacious. The outside garden and gazebo is like something out of a fairytale. The food was incredible the night of my wedding and the staff brought the plates to us even though we had a buffet. I thought that was a nice touch especially since we were on our feet all day. The venue is very well maintained as well.

The conference center at Texas Star was perfect for our wedding. There were many different food and drink options to choose from and the room size was customizable based on how much space we needed. There were some table decorations available to choose from at no additional charge, and we chose to rent the arbor with draping from the venue which made it very easy for me. I love that it was basically one stop shopping - all food and drinks were handled by the venue, as well as table linens. I only hired an outside bakery for the cakes. We served ham, fire roasted veggies and mashed potatoes with a garden salad (dinner station style) and received compliments to the chef from many people. The food was good! I can't say enough nice things about Leslie and Erika. They were responsive to all of my questions and helped us from the day we toured the venue to the day we got married. They seemed genuinely happy for me and my husband. Everyone on staff was so attentive and nice the day of the wedding that I couldn't have asked for anything better. The attached picture is from my phone during setup. All I did was add LED flicker votive candles and silk rose petals to the tables. Everything else was provided by Texas Star. I wish I had more pictures of the room to share but haven't received my professional photos yet.

This venue was a dream! It was so beautiful, and made planning so easy - no need to add tons of decor when the location has so much to offer. Halea and team were amazing to work with, very responsive and informative on every step of the way. Finally, I was surprised how many guests came up to me afterward and told me how delicious the food was - some of their top wedding meal experiences. Could not recommend them more!

The Fairmont and its entire staff were involved in making my event, THE WELCOME PARTY, A TASTE OF THE BAHAMAS the talk of the town. From the event coordinator to the manager of the restaurant to the bellman who helped with bringing the favors to the room, to the staff who cleaned up at 2 am to ensure they did not disturb our function, we could not have asked for a better venue!!! Will recommend it to brides. The food was fantastic and timely too!!

Highly, highly recommend Colleyville Center for your next event (and specifically weddings!) Kristi and Becky were absolutely wonderful to work with. Super responsive, incredibly friendly and easy to work with. The flexibility and space provided by the venue was perfect for our 200 person wedding, all at an affordable price. It is very much a DIY venue, so you have the flexibility to make it your own!

I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect wedding venue! From start to finish, everything exceeded my expectations — the staff was incredibly accommodating, our guests had a wonderful experience, and the food & drinks were outstanding. The entire weekend felt seamless thanks to the attentive team who made sure every detail was taken care of. What truly stood out was the incredible on-site team. The bartenders at The Library Bar kept the energy high and the drinks flowing, the concierge staff throughout the building made every guest feel welcomed, Patrick the head chef and his servers delivered the most delicious meals with flawless service, the staff at Le Spa provided such thoughtful care and relaxation, and of course, our onsite wedding planner Ashley went above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect. The spaces themselves made the day even more special. The exquisite Presidential Bridal Suite was the dreamiest backdrop for my bridal party to get ready together, while the Bridewell Suite served as the perfect space for the groomsmen to gather, welcome guests, and prepare for the big day. Both suites added such a sense of celebration and set the tone for everything that followed. I’ve received so many compliments from our guests, not only about the celebration in the Turtle Creek Ballroom itself but also about their stay at the hotel. It truly made the weekend that much more meaningful to see so many of our friends and family enjoying themselves. Our wedding was unforgettable, and I know it wouldn’t have been possible without this amazing venue and the people behind it. What was already such a special landmark will forever hold an even deeper meaning for me and my growing family. Cheers to 100 more years of memories made here — I’m so grateful ours will always be a part of its history.

We had our wedding and reception at the Hilton Park Cities and we could not have asked for more! We recently celebrated our 10 year anniversary at the hotel and it is still just as great as the day of our wedding! Planning was easy and fun and the staff had many ideas to accommodate all of our requests. The ballroom was beautiful for the ceremony and flipped quickly for the reception. We picked a custom menu and our guests still comment on how much they enjoyed the food. The staff was very attentive and nice, assisting us for the entire day until our event was over. Many of our guests stayed at the hotel. The rooms were clean and trendy and the restaurant and bar area were beautiful! The location is great with lots of shopping and restaurants in walking distance which was perfect for our out of town guests. Everything went smoothly and all of our guests had a great time! It is still a fun place for dinner and drinks or to stay for a weekend!
