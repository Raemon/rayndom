Helen from Flowers N Such was wonderful to work with from the start. She asked thoughtful questions, heard us, and implemented our vision perfectly. She is so talented and warm, and quickly became one of our favorite vendors. We 100% recommend her to anyone!

We worked with Viviano Flower Shop for our wedding, specifically with Kimberly, and I truly could not be happier with how everything turned out. I had a very specific vision for my bouquet and was honestly a little nervous about how it would come together—but the Viviano’s team executed it perfectly. It was exactly what I imagined and more. The florals throughout the day were straight out of my wedding dreams; they completely understood the vibe I was going for. One thing I loved was how convenient it was that they also offered rental items like chargers, candles, an easel, and more. It made planning so much easier and kept everything cohesive. Their pricing felt very reasonable, especially for a downtown Detroit wedding and our guest count. Working with Kimberly was truly one of the highlights of our planning process. She went above and beyond for us. As an admittedly indecisive bride, I wasn’t entirely sure what I wanted for our reception—tables, décor, cake flowers, everything—but she helped guide us toward choices that looked beautiful and fit our budget. She met with us multiple times and genuinely took the time to get to know us. During the final week, she even gave me her personal cell number and took a call from me on her lunch break just to help confirm final details and answer my lingering questions. Her communication was exceptional. On the wedding day, Kim and her team handled all the setup and takedown seamlessly. Everything was stunning and exactly as planned. I am beyond thrilled with our flowers, rentals, and overall experience. Thank you, Viviano’s and Kim, for bringing our vision to life so beautifully!

We are still in awe of the breathtaking floral arrangements that Chalet Floral & Events created for our wedding. From the very beginning, they understood our vision — soft, romantic pastels with a timeless, elegant feel — and somehow brought it to life even more beautifully than we imagined. Every single detail was perfection. The bouquets, centerpieces, ceremony arch, and even the tiniest boutonnières felt like something out of a fairytale. The pastel palette was expertly blended into a stunning display of color, texture, and artistry. Walking into our venue and seeing the flowers for the first time quite literally took our breath away. It was like stepping into a dream. Guests are still talking about how gorgeous everything looked — the flowers added so much warmth and emotion to the day. Beyond the design, Chalet Floral was an absolute joy to work with: kind, creative, responsive, and deeply passionate about their craft. We felt so cared for and completely trusted them every step of the way. Thank you for making our wedding not only beautiful, but bloom with love. You are truly gifted, and we’re forever grateful. With all our hearts, Bo & Megan Davis

Our wedding day was made even more beautiful thanks to the work of The Flower Alley. Every single floral arrangement they created for us took our breath away - from the wedding party bouquets to the ceremony and reception florals, everything was absolutely perfect and exceeded all of our expectations. Leading up to our wedding day, the company was very professional, organized, and great to work with, and we truly appreciate all of their helpful suggestions to maximize our budget and make our vision a reality. We cannot thank The Flower Alley enough for their role in our dream wedding, and we highly recommend them to any couples looking for a talented florist for their special day!

I am so thankful to have booked Posh Petals as my florist!! Elyse and Annie were an absolute joy to work with. They brought such expertise, guidance, and care into all of our planning meetings. They truly understood my vision and executed it perfectly. Their work was SO beautiful-all of our decor and florals were even better than imagined. I love that Elyse will also coordinate rentals like linens, chargers, flatware, and china which made one less vendor we needed to work with. She has such an eye for overall design too and helped curate so many elements of our wedding aesthetic, more than just florals. She is truly so talented! Cannot recommend Posh Petals more!!!

Jennifer's flowers were absolutely gorgeous. She also was incredibly flexible and helpful while we were dealing with covid, long-distance planning, and last-minute changes. She saw my vision, did it within my budget, and did I mention her flowers were gorgeous? I'd definitely hire her again!
