Jennifer was our day of coordinator for our October 2025 wedding and did an outstanding job. We did not have to worry or question anything about the day. She kept us on schedule and was amazing to work with. Everyone involved in the wedding highly enjoyed her that day. She was prompt with arriving and responding to any and all questions. She made the moment so relaxed and fun!

Crystal did a beautiful job with my daughter’s wedding. Her skill and vision are second to none. She kept vendors organized, informed and focused on the big event. Crystal is friendly, easy to talk to and listens intently, not missing a beat. It definitely shows in her attention to detail. She is professional and flexible which was a must for me. Thanks to her, I was able to keep my attention with my daughter on her wedding day, which made it flawless in my eyes!

Ever since I first met Rose in 2024, I knew she was the wedding planner for me! She was so professional and responsive for every detail I wanted. She turned my dreams and inspirations into reality and made my wedding day the smoothest day possible - it truly was perfect! There is no one else I would have trusted to coordinate my wedding day or do my florals and rentals. My hydrangeas were perfect is every way and they made the space. Every little detail was in the perfect place and I wouldn’t have had it any other way. 🫶🏼

If you are looking for a day of wedding coordinator, I promise you Taylor and her team at Champagne Toast Events ARE YOUR PEOPLE!!!! Starting communication 3 months out from the event ensured she was aware of all the details, vendors, and plans well ahead of time. Taylor always responded promptly to any and all of my silly questions leading up to the day. She was incredible and thorough leading up to the wedding and day of, her and her team were beyond amazing. They truly brought my vision to life perfectly. Everything down to each table setting was beyond my expectation. When I saw everything for the first time I was in awe. Her and her team checked on us constantly throughout the day and evening during the reception. They fluffed my dress before walking down the aisle. We never were without food, dessert, or a drink. They made the flow of the day and night so smooth. Everything went perfectly, truly not one mishap and I owe it all to Taylor and her team. They were truly my rock and calm in the storm of all the wedding nerves I was feeling that day. I could never thank Taylor and her team enough for everything they did for us on our wedding day. It’s something I’ll never forget!! It’s worth every single penny to add Taylor to your wedding team because I promise she makes it happen and executes your vision with perfection!!!

we could not recommend working with morgan more!! our whole day went seamlessly and if something didn’t, i don’t even know about it! she is very communicative and helpful if you aren’t quite sure what direction you want to go with certain things. she helped us with timelines and took the reigns with our decor and vendors the day of. everything turned out exactly (if not better) than i imagined and she kept everything right on schedule through the night. so glad we had the chance to work with her!

Hiring Moments by Hannah was, without question, the best decision we made for our wedding. Hannah Stanback went above and beyond in every possible way, from the planning process all the way through the wedding day itself. Her attention to detail, organization, and calm presence made everything feel effortless. On our wedding day, we truly did not answer a single question or worry about a single detail. Hannah handled everything with such care and confidence that we were able to be fully present and enjoy every moment. What sets Hannah apart is not only her professionalism, but also how genuinely kind and invested she is. She has an incredible ability to anticipate needs before they arise and make thoughtful decisions that keep the day running smoothly. Even in moments that could have felt stressful, she remained calm, reassuring, and completely in control, which made such a difference for us and our families. If you are even considering hiring a wedding planner, I cannot recommend Moments by Hannah enough. Hannah does far more than manage timelines. She creates an experience that allows couples to truly enjoy their wedding day. Our day would not have been the same without her, and we are endlessly grateful for everything she did to make it so special.

Jenah and her assistant were wonderful! I hired her for day-of services. We could never have handled set up, take down, or all the behind-the-scenes things with our her! She brought my vision to life and executed flawlessly! My family always says she is so kind and sweet but also knows how to direct people efficiently and get sh** done! We love Jenah and would highly recommend Seed and Seal.

After several interviews with wedding coordinators my daughter decided to hire Kaela and her team. Well we both agree...she made the right decision. They were amazing from first meeting to leaving the venue. They were very helpful with suggestions when she was confused on what she wanted, they were organized, professional, timely and fun. Kaela and Shelby were just wonderful to work with. I don't know of anything that went wrong. They had it all under control. I will be recommending these two to anyone that needs someone to help. Because of the work these ladies put in, I was able to enjoy my day with my daughter and that was priceless. Thank you Kaela and Shelby for all your hard work. You were amazing!!!!

I worked with Candice for my September 2025 wedding at the Kentucky Derby museum. She made the process so lovely. And helped me organize more than I thought I needed to. She gave me good questions to think about to help with the flow of the event and she executed all of my wildest dreams for my wedding. She was very accommodating to all my request and I can’t thank her enough for helping with my wedding!

Whitney Holmes from Christina Burton Events is amazing. We hired her as our day of coordinator for our wedding on October 8, 2022 and she made sure that everything was perfect on our special day. I met with Whitney a few times in the months leading up to the wedding so she knew every little detail about the day. She also sent me an online planning tool where I could update things about the wedding for her there too which made me feel like we were always in touch. She created the most detailed timeline for our wedding day and made sure every single vendor had it. On the day of the wedding, Whitney took care of literally everything. I have no idea when vendors showed up, when or how they got set up, or anything because Whitney had it completely under control. That meant I was able to be entirely stress free and enjoy my day with my girls while getting ready! Whitney rangled in my wedding party when it was time for pictures, the ceremony, cocktail hour, and the reception portion of the day and we never got off schedule - which I super appreciate because it meant my husband and I got to enjoy every single moment of our wedding without being rushed. Our wedding was a dream and turned out beautifully, all thanks to Whitney from CBE. If you’re thinking about hiring her, do it now before she books up!! You simply cannot have your wedding without her. We love you so much Whitney!! Thank you!!
