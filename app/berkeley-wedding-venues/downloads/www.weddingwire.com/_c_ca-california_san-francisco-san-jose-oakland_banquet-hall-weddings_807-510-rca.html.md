We had an exceptional experience hosting our daughter’s wedding at this venue. From start to finish, the management and staff were professional, respectful, highly responsive, and extremely prompt. They honored every contractual commitment and were flexible whenever possible, making the entire planning process smooth and stress-free. What truly stood out was their understanding of the pressure and emotions involved in a wedding. They ensured that every detail—venue setup, hall, chairs, tables, buffet arrangements, and food—was delivered exactly as agreed. The owners were always actively involved, closely monitoring everything to ensure the event’s success, which gave us great peace of mind. One of the most impressive and memorable gestures was when the owner, Arunji, personally ensured that the chef we had originally agreed upon was secured—even though the chef had already moved on. Thanks to Arunji for bringing back Chef Mani! The food was absolutely excellent, and even today our wedding guests continue to talk about how delicious it was. That says everything. A special shout-out to Manager Manoj for his coordination and support throughout. We are truly grateful to the entire team for making our daughter’s wedding such a beautiful and memorable celebration. Highly recommended without hesitation!

I had my Wedding Ceremony and Reception at Villa Ragusa in September 2023 and it was so beautiful and funny. My guest really loved the venue, food and bar. we have 360 guests and had plenty of space for ceremony, reception, dancing and dinner buffet. Villa Ragusa's staff took great care of us!

Great central location, good team for day or and planning up to the wedding day. If you want a venue where you can have options for vendors your hiring this is a good choice. The team day of was assertive on helping it go smooth and the security was awesome to have. The bartenders that came with the venue did such an amazing job keeping up with my guests. That was a huge deal for me as most of my guests were between 30-50 and like to have a good time so I wanted to make sure there was no line at the bar and good drinks being made. It went well and I'm sure happy with how the wddding went. Leanne my planner helped me so much and did such a great job. Couldn't have done it without her as well. Thank you for having us.

As a member of a Warriors family, I thought of the Chase center for my milestone celebration and it was the most memorable experience ever! Kendra and company were incredibly accommodating, flexible and went above and beyond to bring my vision to life. The stadium tour, my photo across every screen, custom draped entry with a champagne greeting. It was a special night. The catering and beverage options were very flexible. Icustomized my menus to fit my guests. There was a great selection of wine and desserts. The catering and events staff arranged everything as I instructed down to the custom lighting. Kendra found ways for me to utilize space and decor cost effectively and she really impressed us with the keepsakes for guests. I can't wait to book with them again and I'd highly recommend booking your special occasion here. It's a beautiful place awaiting your vision to bring it to life.

I'm a professional wedding photographer and I've recently shot a wedding at Granada Ballroom. It's a great venue for weddings. The overall atmosphere, picturesque spots, and very helpful staff members play a huge success for any couple and create a magical moment for photographers. I can't wait to go back and do it again!

We could not have been more excited to have our wedding at the MMC in San Francisco for our October 2016 nuptials. Lisa Jimenez was so attentive to all of our questions and any concerns that we had along our almost 1.5 year process. She made sure we had all we needed for our special day. The bridal suite was amazingly wonderful. Plenty of room for my bridesmaids to get ready. We had 2 hairdressers and 2 makeup artist, 2 photographers and a videographer in the room and we had plenty of room. We had our ceremony and reception on the 11th floor in the Crystal Ballroom. Our ceremony was beautiful. We transformed the ballroom with curtains and floral arrangements to block the back and front walls. The help we received with all of our plans was amazing. We selected an open bar with passed hors d'oeuvres. From the buffet set up, we asked for the antipasto and cheese trays to be placed in the cocktail bar for our guests to enjoy before dinner. Our guests tell us the food was great, we didn't get to try much of it as we were chatting with guests and taking pictures. We took our main set of pictures in the beautiful library post ceremony; totally recommend at least a few pictures there. Simone, our day of coordinator was great. She made sure everything ran smoothly throughout the day, even fluffing my dress one last time before I walked down the aisle. We set up a charging station for our guests and the MMC set up a sign with their Wi-Fi. What a nice touch...our youngest guests were excited to have Wi-Fi available throughout the night. Our wedding ended early the next morning and were welcomed to our suite with a bottle of sparkling wine, cake and a set of beautiful MMC flutes (which we accidently left in the room). We had the wedding of our dreams and can't thank the MMC staff enough for all they did! Lisa you are the best!

My wedding at The Log Cabin in 2024 was nothing short of magical. The venue exudes a charming rustic vibe with its beautiful wooden beams and stunning views of the surrounding greenery. Right when we stepped in we were captivated by its warm and inviting atmosphere, making it the perfect backdrop for our special day. The natural light streaming in created a cozy yet elegant ambiance- our guests couldn’t stop raving about how breathtaking the venue was. The staff at The Log Cabin were absolutely incredible, ensuring everything went off without a hitch. They were attentive and friendly, which made the planning process a breeze. The food was exceptional. Our day was filled with laughter, love, and unforgettable memories, and I can’t recommend The Log Cabin at The Presidio enough for anyone looking for a beautiful venue with a laid-back yet classy vibe.
