Breathe taking views, amazing food, perfect party 

We truly had the best day of our lives at Rancho Nicasio and cannot say enough good things about it! From the beginning the process was seamless. RN provides nearly everything - food, alcohol, lights, wedding coordinator, etc so all we had to do was make a few decisions and provide DJ, photographer, dessert. Marina was incredible to work with and made the months leading up and day of stress free.  
  
The location is the perfect combination of character and beauty and the fact that they pride themselves in sourcing local food and drinks was the cherry on top. Our guests are still talking about how beautiful the venue was and nearly every person said it was THE BEST food they ever had at a wedding!

Thank you Rancho Nicasio! 

I got married in September 2025, and the whole day was absolutely amazing. From initial conversations with Marina all the way to the final day-of details, Marina was organized, considerate, and an overall pleasure to work with. Her organized planning document and phone calls helped me feel heard and on top of things! She helped my wedding vision come to life! The venue itself is beautiful and it was the perfect space to accommodate 160 guests. The food and drinks were fantastic, and there were many options for every dietary need. Rancho Nicasio's crew and sound tech were all so kind and professional. There is a bridal cottage on site that my bridesmaids and I had access to the morning of the wedding. This made getting ready and seeing the venue come together easy and relaxing. Our wedding day was the best day of my life, and Rancho Nicasio played a huge role in that! I cannot recommend and thank them enough!!

Perfect Wedding 

We hosted our daughter’s wedding ceremony and reception at Rancho Nicasio in late September and could not have been happier with the outcome. From initial contact throughout the planning and execution of the 150 person event, Marina was a pleasure to work with and made everything effortless. Her guidance and recommendations were very helpful and always aimed at delivering the best possible guest and bridal experience. From coordinating with our band to the minute to minute timing of the day, it all went without any hitches or surprises. Clearly this venue knows what they are doing and does it well. The settling is of course gorgeous, surrounded the beautiful Marin countryside and provides an ideal layout for ceremony, dinner, and dancing. While space is abundant it maintains an intimate feeling to ensure guest are comfortable, relaxed and have an enjoyable time. The cottage provided to the bridal part for the entire day was a huge benefit for overall logistics and providing the bride that special time with her closest friends. Last but certainly least, the food was amazing! Getting a buffet done right for 150 is not easy task, yet the kitchen delivered perfectly cooked salmon and chicken, a beautiful spread of roasted vegetables as well as everything else on the menu that simply exceeded expectations. We were beyond pleased as was our daughter. At the end of the day, giving the bride her dream wedding is what it is all about and with the right excellence of Rancho Nicasio, her dream came true.

Amazing Wedding at Rancho Nicasio, Thanks to Marina!

We would highly recommend Rancho Nicasio as a wedding venue! Marina was great to work with throughout the process - she’s an incredible and detail oriented planner.  
The venue is gorgeous; beautiful views for our ceremony, large outdoor spaces, and the charming, rustic Rancho room. The food was delicious & service was made easy by the onsite restaurant & staff. The team made sure everything ran seamlessly, and our guests have had nothing but good feedback. Get the late night bites!  
If you're looking for a beautiful venue and a stress-free experience, we highly recommend Rancho Nicasio!

Perfect wedding

Absolutely perfect experience. We reached out to Rancho Nicasio with a pretty short timetable after a previous venue fell through, and they made it happen with no fuss or drama. Everything taken care of, all our requests incorporated into the plan. Plus a very reasonable price, delicious food, helpful staff, and beautiful venue and scenery. Could not possibly have been better.

Our Dream Wedding Venue!

My husband and I fell in love with Rancho Nicasio the first time we toured the venue. It had such a warm, authentic feel — the perfect mix of natural beauty and charm. By the time of our wedding, we knew we couldn’t have chosen a better place to get married. Marina was so patient, professional, and level-headed throughout our planning process. We had a last-minute chance of rain, and Marina spent hours perfecting various individualized backup plans so that we could approach the day with minimal nerves. It ended up being a beautiful day. Our guests did not stop talking about how tasty the food was and how special the setting was. We felt so taken care of the entire time. We are so grateful to Rancho Nicasio for creating this experience for us, and we would not change a thing.

Ten out of ten

As a queer mixed-race couple with a very diverse community, we wanted a place for our May 2024 wedding that reflected who we were and that would be comfortable and inviting for everyone. Our criteria were that it was somewhere beautiful, had delicious food, and wasn’t too far from the East Bay. We visited a few venues around the Bay, but they all felt like copy/paste of whatever pinterest wedding fad was happening at the time. Beautiful, but just not us. I heard about RN and asked a friend from the area if she knew it. Without hesitation she said, “That place is great!”   
We went to visit in May 2023 to scope it out and meet with Marina, the event coordinator. The backdrop for RN is quintessentially California: tightly nestled in golden rolling hills flanked with redwood forest. The venue itself is funky, rustic, and meticulously cared for. We went through the event space and overviewed the planning process. Before we even left, we knew it was a solid yes.   
People say planning a wedding is stressful but not when you’re working with Marina. Over the next year we had regular phone calls to go over the spreadsheets she’s created that cover EVERYTHING, and were customized to our vision. We did our own flowers, had friends make cakes, a memorial table, and lots of bespoke table decorations/ signage. The organizational planning we’d done over the previous months made it simple and easy to drop off the items the day before/morning of, and they were set up exactly how we wanted. Picking up the items the day after was just as easy.  
When the Big Day came, we walked through the gates into our own private and stunning wonderland. The garden teemed with flowers, butterflies, and birds. During the ceremony, a family of quail scuttled behind the arbor. During cocktail hour, servers passed delicate appetizers and fresh drinks to our guests. Dinner was superb. “Buffet” and “salmon” don’t usually go together for me, but the chef is a sorcerer; it was moist and perfectly seasoned. As the evening progressed, the friendly bartenders crafted our specialty cocktails with consistency and finesse. When the fog rolled in, we headed inside to the dancefloor where the nearby tables offered space for non-dancers to still be a part of the party. The entire experience went off without a hitch. The whole experience exceeded my expectations.  
As for Marina. It’s palpable she genuinely cares about not only the couple, but also the guests, staff, and the West Marin community. Her approach to planning is methodical, focused, empathic, and invested. She went above and beyond to make our wedding special. Marina did her own research and worked with the chef to come up with recipes for foods we wanted to reflect my fiance’s culture but they didn’t offer on the menu– Cuban pork and black beans. We wanted to make sure the venue was wheelchair accessible, and Marina happily sent us measurements and photos of all the door thresholds. Her care reflects in the staff– everyone seemed happy to be there. In all the packing and unpacking of the decorations, nothing was missing or broken. On top of being REALLY good at her job, Marina is a brilliant and funny person. We were happy to have her as a wedding coordinator, and now thrilled to have her as a friend.   
Tips: Marina offers various table decorations to rent for the event such as votive candles; This will save you time, space in your garage, and money. Also, rent the heat lamps. That fog is cold.

Best wedding decision!

We are so glad we chose Rancho Nicasio as our wedding venue. This was without a doubt one of the best decisions we made about our wedding. The setting is beautiful, food was absolutely delicious (and attended to many different dietary restrictions), and all the staff were excellent. The venue day-of coordinator, Marina, was also incredible. She is very experienced, organized, and went above and beyond to make our day as smooth as possible both before and on the big day. And of course, the location is incredible being within an hour to 2 major airports, yet feeling tucked away in rural old style California. I cannot recommend Rancho enough!

Best night ever!

I grew up in Marin County and now live in Brooklyn, NY. When I got engaged, it was important to me that we had a West Marin wedding as this special part of the state is something we really wanted all of our friends from all over the world to see. The first planner I spoke to told me what I wanted was impossible to pull off. But I’m determined….  
My first idea was to have a Welcome Party at Rancho Nicasio for what ended up being 150 people. I had my 8th grade Father Daughter Dance there and its been a special place to me since I was a little girl. From the moment I reached out and started talking to Marina, the events co-ordinator, everything was SEAMLESS. She was so on top of it, helped me plan every detail and stayed in consistent, clear communication.   
This planning took about one year and had many meticulous details- a roving count of guests, a local band, a little girl’s birthday and provided transportation to name a few. Marina was AMAZING all along, as was Jamie who did the sound for our speeches and the event. A truly TOP NOTCH crew.  
Then came the actual night- because of other events planned for this Wedding Weekend, I wanted Rancho to not be decorated and just be shown for the beautiful, special and preserved place it is. When we arrived, I was blown away by how beautiful it was- the setting sun, beautiful table settings, lovely bar, such polite and well dressed service. It was far beyond my expectations. The food was amazing, the setting breathtaking and the whole night beyond our wildest dreams.  
Thank you to Marina and everyone at Rancho Nicasio who made our dreams come true and gave ourselves and our guests a true West Marin night that will remain unmatched and be in everyone’s memories for many years to come. I could not recommend this venue and their staff more, and we will always be back to remember the best weekend of our lives.

Long Distance Win!

Planning an important event long distance is hard, but the folks at Rancho Nicasio made it really easy. Working over the phone with Marina to plan food for 45 and select the most comfortable space to gather was a real pleasure. It’s not always possible to do this, but they allowed us to wait until the day of the event to decide whether to eat inside or outside with space heaters. The food was delicious, the setting was charming, the wait staff was attentive, and our guests raved about how wonderful the evening was. Thank You Rancho Nicasio!
