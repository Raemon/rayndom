I can not say enough about how Paige made a special day even more special. It was out 45th anniversary and we did a vow renewal. She absolutely is wonderful. No one has any clue how much love and time that she dedicates to behind the scenes to make sure every detail is handled. This is the 3rd event she has done for us. Our daughter's wedding and one month later our son's wedding. She has an absolutely creative and beautiful vision for everything. She treated every event as if it was her own. Can't say how much we appreciate her and her family.

Andrea was just the girl we needed to make our wedding day seamless. Meeting once a week a couple months before the wedding was perfect. She was always reliable which made me feel so at ease on our wedding day, know she had everything under control!! We had some weird issues come up in the planning process with our venue contact, but Andrea helped us feel very justified in our concerns and advised us so well as to how to handle it, what questions to ask etc! It felt like she had our backs through and through, throughout the whole process. I can’t think of anything that went wrong on the wedding day, which I’m sure is a testament to all Andrea did behind the scenes. She’s the best!

Working with Jenn and her incredible team was hands-down one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. I’ve known Jen personally for a while, and she has always been amazing—but seeing her in action during our wedding planning process was next level!! From start to finish, she brought a level of professionalism, creativity, and calm that made the entire experience so much more enjoyable. Every little detail was handled with care and intention, and it truly felt like she and her team poured their hearts into bringing our vision to life. Everything about the day and the process was so smooth and if anything went wrong I definitely didn’t know about it! Not only was everything absolutely beautiful and seamless on the big day, but the entire journey leading up to it felt organized, supported, and fun. I never had to worry about a thing. Jenn anticipated the needs I didn’t even know I had and went above and beyond. If you’re thinking about hiring a planner—do it, and hire Jenn and her team. You’ll get so much more than a wedding planner. You’ll get a true partner, a calming presence, and someone who genuinely wants the best for you. Happy wedding planning!! ❤️

We had the Royal Team do Hair and Make Up for our wedding in June and I could not recommend a better team! We had a pretty large group of 16 girls, Chenea and Amber doing hair while Andrea, Resha and Liz were doing make up. They were absolutely wonderful to work with from my trial, which included making arrangements with me because I live out of state, up until the touch ups to ensure perfection before they left on wedding day! They traveled to us, brought all the necessities and more, and made sure we were happy with our hairstyle and make up and didn’t hesitate to fix or change something if we asked. Not only did I, as the bride, feel beyond beautiful, but all the girls felt the same! We all received so many compliments throughout the day/night on our hair and make up. Thank you again for making not only me feel absolutely beautiful on my wedding day, but the entire bride crew!

Jean and her team are professional, proactive, connected and solved any issue that came up throughout planning. Me and Vamsi couldn't have planned these events over 3 days without the help. My family came in from India and it was the best time

Deciding to work with Sarah for our wedding was one of the best decisions we've ever made. Sarah provided a sense of calm and security for our big day. She kept us on track with various timelines and budgets while navigating us through all of the planning process. Most (if not all) of the vendors we worked with were recommendations of Sarah and we loved each and every one of them. Sarah and her team really go above and beyond and are the reason our wedding day went without a hitch! I would recommend Sarah to everyone!

We cannot say enough amazing things about Christine and her tam! From the very first consultation, she made my husband and me feel completely supported and confident in the entire planning process. Over the 12 months leading up to our wedding, she kept everything organized, on track, and moving seamlessly. She thought of things we never would have, even the smallest details, making sure nothing was overlooked. On the wedding day, she was incredible at coordinating all the vendors, guiding guests, and keeping the day running smoothly, so we could fully enjoy every moment without stress. Her calm, professional, and proactive approach made everything feel effortless. From timeline creation, vendor management, décor guidance, and day-of coordination to keeping us sane through the planning journey, she truly went above and beyond. If you want a wedding planner who is organized, detail-oriented, creative, and genuinely cares about making your day perfect, look no further Christine is your girl!!

Indygigz was absolutely my saving grace during all planning, coordinating, and execution of my wedding day. Betsy genuinely got to know my husband and I as a couple so she could really make our personalities shine through every detail in our wedding. She without a doubt made our vision come to life. She was so attentive to all of our needs and was always available for every question, big or small. Betsy stood by my side during everything and was always there for support and to lend a helping hand. She also graciously took over all vendor communication so I would have less on my plate. No matter what unforeseeable hiccup came along, Betsy handled it with determination and charm. (Most of which I never even knew happened because she was so on top of things) Betsy provides helpful advice when asked and advocates for all hopes you have regarding the big day. She makes it happen. She truly made things feel easy in a stressful time. Betsy is dedicated, hard working, detail oriented, and a great communicator. She has wonderful relationships with all vendors and provided the best recommendations for my team. All aspects of my wedding went smoothly and I am so grateful I chose Indygigz for the most important day of my life. I could not have done it without her!
