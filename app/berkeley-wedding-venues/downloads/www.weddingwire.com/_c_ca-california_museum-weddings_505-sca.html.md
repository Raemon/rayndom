OCMA was an amazing wedding venue to work at. Been in the industry for a number of years, we've DJ'd venues all across California but found OCMA to our favorite one yet. The staff was wonderful to work with and the acoustic sound that this venue was able to produce was astounding. Our couple had the night of their lives here. Definitely OC's hippest new wedding venue right now and a hidden gem that probably won't be hidden much longer.

I had my wedding at the Gray Matter museum. The event set and the whole staff made my day perfect! I originally was going to have the reception on the lawn and it started pouring and the whole staff moved the whole set up inside. All the chairs for the ceremony got wet and right before the ceremony they wiped down every chair. Marie made sure my day was perfect for me. Our photographer Shane was awesome! He made sure he got all the right photos with the right lighting. Our DJ Joey C played the music we wanted plus some other great dancing music. The whole night Marie and Kelly kept making sure I have eaten, I drank water, made sure I had a drink if I needed one and I could not be more thankful for them

I found this venue after typing in budget friendly venue options. Now hear me out… This is an all inclusive space and if you have a budget, I assure you that Monica will help you stick to that. When we had our very first meeting and I received my quote I told her that this is where I wanted to stay And we made it happen. The venue does not need much as it is beautiful on its own. We had the entire venue for the entire day so that allowed us to not have to rush and so I think that that is an option to explore if that is within your budget. Everything was what I imagined it to be! The only hiccup was the lighting was not what I requested, but in the big scheme of things I’m not going to dwell on that. Monica, was our person for the venue. She is extremely efficient and a pleasure to work with. My wedding was perfect!

The Heritage Museum of OC is a beautiful little gem in Santa Ana. My husband and I knew after our first tour of the grounds that this was our wedding venue. We have zero regrets. It’s a gorgeous space! The house is beautiful and the grounds are well maintained year-round. Not only that, but the staff at the museum are so wonderful and easy to work with. Kaitlyn was our venue coordinator and she was fantastic from day one. She answered all of my endless questions throughout the wedding planning process and was always incredibly patient, helpful and kind. She really calmed my nerves the night before and the day of the wedding. The venue was also super flexible with last minute rainstorms. The canopies didn’t take away from how beautiful the venue is. I highly recommend getting married here rain or shine!

We loved this venue and all our memories from our wedding. We worked with Narod who helped in all communication. We also got help from Ryan in AV. They were both so easy going and great to work with! We loved how beautiful the setup is. The ceremony outside was so nice. The Redwood Hall is also so gorgeous for photos and fun for dancing. We also really liked the cocktail area. We got an animal ambassador and guests had fun seeing the ferret and kestrel. We got nothing but compliments related to how fun the venue was. We are so happy we chose this place for our wedding. We loved the experience. Thank you to CuriOdyssey for going above and beyond. From communication early on to day of. It was amazing!

As mother of the groom I was asked to help with the planning of their 'wedding's eve' event. I found the Seymour Center online by chance and I'm so glad I did! From it's awesome location on an ocean bluff to the event room itself, it was the perfect setting for the dinner. We really appreciated that they did not require us to use their vendors (although they provided suggestions), plus we were able to bring in our own alcohol which saved us a lot of $$. The staff was so easy to work with. Of all the vendors I had contact with, they always gave the quickest responses. They were very accommodating to some of our more unique needs. We used just the La Feliz Room, but the entire Exhibit Hall was also available to rent. It is a flexible venue that can be used for a fully catered formal wedding or a more casual do-it-yourself event. Ours was somewhere in between so it was perfect. I would highly recommend this venue for any large gathering.

As people who have loved the Exploratorium since we were kids, it was the perfect wedding venue for us! We had the ceremony in the outdoor gallery and the reception in the Central and West galleries. We chose these spaces to prioritize the best exhibits over the best view of the Bay (but the view back into the city was perfect for the ceremony!). Everyone at the Exploratorium was so helpful in the planning stages, expertly answering all questions and helping figure out some complicated logistics with dropping off and picking up decorations (we did all the flowers and decorations ourselves). The day went so smoothly - the timeline was tight, but everyone coordinated expertly! Our 160 guests LOVED playing with the exhibits throughout the evening, and having the Exploratorium staff on hand to run exhibits made it that much better. We truly couldn't have asked for a more perfect wedding!

If you’re considering getting married at the Los Altos History Museum—do it, and make sure you work with Lisa. She made us feel taken care of in every way. When it looked like rain, she calmly walked us through backup options and made everything feel manageable. When we needed help, she had answers before we even finished the question. The most memorable part? She hand-crafted the golf-themed signage for our wedding. It was a masterpiece and became one of the most talked-about details of the entire night. Lisa made our day magical, personal, and seamless. We are forever grateful.

Wow! What more can we say. We had very high expectations for our wedding and Rincon highly exceeded these expectations. The Santa Barbara Zoo is an unbelievable venue - stunningly beautiful arrangement with high attention to detail. Our guests were able to arrive early and explore the Zoo and the giraffe-feeding was a major highlight. Rincon Events (we worked with Kinsey) is a highly-professional wedding coordinator company and catering company. Kinsey made us feel so special, like we were the only wedding she was planning. The day-of coordination was brilliant and executed flawlessly. The food is out-of-this-world good. Highly recommend the churros and the carrot-walnut souffle. You can't go wrong with Rincon and the Santa Barbara Zoo.
