I cannot recommend Madeleine ENOUGH!! From the moment we had our first conversation to my actual wedding date she was responsive, flexible, helpful and gave me the most wonderful music on my wedding day. I am so thankful that I found her. I had some odd requests for my ceremony and she made my music dreams come true. Absolutely the best and so easy to work with. Thank you Madeleine!!!

The Synergy Twins were amazing! They are incredibly gifted musicians & so kind to work with! We booked with them a year in advance for my daughter’s wedding & they were so wonderful during the entire process! I recommended them to a friend of our family, who also used them to play for their wedding! You will love having them as a highlight of any event!

We were thrilled to have Charleston Entertainment play at our wedding ceremony and cocktail hour. They not only did a phenomenal job, but they were incredibly professional, and you could tell that they wanted our day to go as smoothly as possible. Ahead of the wedding, everyone we communicated with was helpful and efficient with responses; they made the whole process so seamless and easy. I cannot recommend them enough!

Arline and David were the perfect bow on top to our wedding day. Their strings helped set the exact mood and vibe we were trying to create and we would recommend them to anyone! Arline sent us a very long list of songs they were prepared to play, and was super accommodating when we picked options off the list. On wedding day they were on point in terms of timing and sound. We appreciate the flexibility and professionalism throughout the process, thanks again!!! \- Emily and Charlie

We were absolutely blown away by the performance of Charleston Virtuosi string quartet at our wedding ceremony at the French Huguenot Church. Their music added a touch of elegance and romance to our special day. The band they provided for our wedding reception at Dewberry Hotel was equally amazing, keeping the energy high and the dance floor packed all night long. Not only did they play all our favorite songs, but they also learned and performed a few special requests that made our day even more memorable. We cannot recommend Charleston Virtuosi enough for their exceptional talent and professionalism
