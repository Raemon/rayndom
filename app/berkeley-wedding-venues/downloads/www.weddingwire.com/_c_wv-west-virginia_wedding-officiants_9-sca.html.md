Ours was a bit of a complex situation. My husband to be has some health issues that caused us to have to postpone in November. Chris was a pro's pro in demonstrating genuine concern for his health. He made a stressful situation flow extremely smoothly given the circumstances.

Pam is a sweet lady and does a great job. She lives in a country setting and has a gazebo with beautiful background that she uses to marry couples in. Her and her husband both were great as he took pictures while she was reading the scripture and marrying us.

We were married on 10/15, and we LOVED using her for our officiant! She was always responsive to our needs and questions, and she designed a beautiful ceremony that fit us perfectly! We received many compliments on her ceremony. We chose to do a non-religious ceremony. We highly recommend Bethany to anyone looking for an officiant who goes above and beyond!

David was absolutely phenomenal. He was flexible with how my husband and I wanted our ceremony to be. We wanted our ceremony to be personal and even though David was not familiar with what we wanted he did his research and accompanied whatever we wanted! His personality was easy to get along with and enjoyable to work with. Definitely recommend!
