5.0 

Juan Carlos was amazing to work with. We booked him for guitar and violin playing for our ceremony and cocktail hour. He is capable of playing so many songs and they sound absolutely beautiful. He perfectly played all the songs for our processional, groom entrance, and bride entrance. He is willing to learn new songs, but we picked from the ones he has because he already knows so many. I highly recommend Juan Carlos. He is super talented, professional, and all around an amazing vendor to work with.
