The best anecdote I have to describe these guys: The invitations we ordered had a design that included a verse in Hebrew. When we got the proofs, I went over the information we submitted: our names, the date, venue, etc. I was excited. I forwarded the email to my husband, who immediately comes back with, "There's a typo in the Hebrew." As mentioned, we did not submit the Hebrew. It was part of the design. I emailed our contact person about it, a bit flustered. She came back and basically said, "We've had that design for 15 years, and no one has ever noticed that. Let me contact the designers." Within a few hours, we had a response. The design was being corrected, and if everything else looked good, we'd be the first with the correct Hebrew. Our invitations were beautiful. The pictures didn't do them justice. And we spent far less than we would have with many other vendors. They were perfect.

Celeste was so great and fun to work with! We absolutely loved all our wedding stationery! From our magnet save the dates to our beautiful glittery invites we couldn’t have been happier! Celeste was very creative and made all our stationery unique while still keeping a consistent theme. She was even able to provide us with vinyl stickers with arrows for the floor of our reception venue to help guests find their way. If you’re looking for a wide variety of options and great customer service, this is the place! Thank you to everyone at Zephyr for helping our dream wedding come true!

This is probably a very much long over due review. But going through my wedding box I had to leave a review for Ephemera. My husband and I got married in a theater and had an old Hollywood theme. Arin was a miracle worker and made our wedding truly one of a kind. I had no idea all the personalizations you can do, and the creativity Arin had. Sometimes I felt like I was talking in circles in what I wanted but she got the vision perfectly. She did our wedding invitations, playbill programs, and movie posters for our entry way. Wow. Wow. Wow. I still have them in my wedding box. And proud of the work she was able to create for me. Arin was there for every question I had, and got everything done as quick as she could. She was up front on costs and when things needed to be done and ordered. Thank you Arin. And I’m sorry for this delay in a review

I loved working with Emily! We were very collaborative to create the prettiest wedding invitation suite and then my wedding program fans as well. They turned out just perfectly. The communication process was so easy and fun. She can work with you on any budget! So happy we chose her and added that little something extra special to our big day.

When I got the invitation for my best friend's wedding a year ago, I immediately commented on how beautiful and unique they were. She told me about Laura's Etsy shop - and it was an easy choice to go with Laura for my own invitations! We decided on the Astoria wedding invite suite, which perfectly captures our modern but elegant style. Laura was a pleasure to work with and the process of ordering and proofing the invitations was very easy. Best of all, the quality for the price is unbeatable!

Without Bridal Sweet and Deb I would have been lost! I found just what I wanted and she is the best! I wanted old fashioned invites and I told her my vision. She went right to a invite sample book and found what I wanted. She is amazing and so fair with her prices!!! My cake server and toasting flutes were both under $20. Without Bridal Sweet I would have not been as happy with my products and would have spent much more!!!
