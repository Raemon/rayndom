Germán did a wonderful job as a DJ for our wedding in La Romana! He video chatted us a couple times before the big day and made us feel comfortable using his services- and he did not disappoint! He listened to our wishes but used his expertise to liven up the dance floor. He also did a great job as MC and paid attention to the wedding to have great timing. The whole GCStar team is great and Veronica had great communication and was great help as well! 10/10 recommend using their services!!

Best Dj service ever!! My friend recently got married at Dreams and she hired this Company for her wedding. So easy to work with!! We just completed a form and he provided the music and turned it into the best party we have ever been to. I highly recommend hiring Weventz for any event. I am sure your expectations will be exceeded. Alejandro we love you. You are the best DJ in Punta Cana!!!

I cannot express how thankful I was for Vizman & his team! Sooo professional. Kept the wedding organized and fun! His MC is phenomenal such a great time and experience! They provided lighting, dance floor, love sign & cold fire & even threw in a few cold fire completely complimentary! They were so easy to work with! Would definitely recommend my resort charged a $600 fee for outside vendors and even with that fee his prices and professionalism was so much better than the dj the resort suggested !! I did so much research before hiring him and my goodness soo worth it! Thank you for making my wedding so memorable Vizman!! \- the Swanson’s!

Professional, responsive, and provides excellent service! EPC events made planning a destination wedding seamless. We had a walkway on the beach, the illuminated LOVE sign, awesome DJ, cold fireworks, and dance floor. Everything was done perfectly and can't thank them enough for helping to create my dream wedding!

Moncho is the best DJ you can get!!!, no doubt!!. My wedding planner had a couple of vendors she worked with and I trust her with almost everything, but the DJ had to be something really special. I wanted to make sure I find a DJ able to keep everybody on the dance floor and that’s what Moncho did. My guests were on the dance floor from the beginning till the end of the party (crazy!). It was a challenging mission because my husband is american and I'm latina, so being able to mix music for both of our cultures was just beyond amazing. We danced Merengue, salsa, hip hop, reggeaton, pop, dance music, tambores, etc etc. We found moncho on Weddingwire (and stalked him on social media). After watching his videos playing at weddings and corporate events, we had to hire him!! My wedding planner contacted him, and he was responsive, willing to work with her, very professional, kind, punctual and just amazing. I sent him 4 playlists with 2 notes: 1) please for the cocktail hour please put the playlist as it is and 2) My only desire is to keep people on the dance floor, if my playlist doesn't work, do your thing, I trust you. He did his job perfectly! Thank you Moncho for the best party of my life, and so lucky it was my wedding! 100% recommended. 5 stars everything!

We used Makuto Deejay + MC services for our wedding this past Saturday, January 17th 2026. I cannot say enough great things about them! They followed my exact vision for the dance floor and there were people out there all night long! One song after the other got the crowd going and I should add that I am a Colombian who married someone from the midwest, so there was the need for a good mix of Salsa but also American classics to keep both parties engaged. They blew it out of the park! Would highly highly recommend for your destination wedding. We had several people tell us it was the best wedding they had been to and I attribute the majority of that to Makuto and their team. 10/10!!
