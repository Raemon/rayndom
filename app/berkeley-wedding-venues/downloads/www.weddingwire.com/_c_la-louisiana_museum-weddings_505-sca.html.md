We got married in The Presbytere last week and had an amazing experience. The second floor gallery has enormous floor-length windows that fill the space with terrific light. We rented some chairs, an aisle runner, and flowers and VOILA -- we had a beautiful wedding in a historic setting! Guests also loved perusing the Mardi Gras exhibit on the second floor as they arrived. Faith and Yvonne at the venue were flexible to work with through months worth of calls and emails and they helped us troubleshoot solutions when a hurricane forced us to move everything up 3 hrs on short notice (i.e., the night before the event!). Can't say enough good about our experience!

We had our wedding at this venue in October and the location was perfect. The building has a great New Orleans feel right in the middle of the French Quarter. Even as a blank slate, the venue was beautiful and fit our theme perfectly. You have to keep in mind this place is not a traditional venue but Tori was so helpful and was instrumental in making our dream vision come true. This is a great place to book if you are looking for a classic New Orleans wedding. Keep in mind traffic though and watch out for any events, that would be my only concern in hindsight.

I loved working with the wonderful women at Snyder Museum. They were easy to work with and accommodated me with everything I needed. Also, we could use the site for as long as we wanted to. We didn't leave the reception until midnight.

I cannot say enough about how incredible The Cabildo was for our wedding venue. Especially have to give a shout-out to their event coordinator, Madison, who is incredibly responsive, patiently answered all of our many questions, was a thought partner as we tried to figure out what works for us and how we wanted to structure the event, and let us visit when we could be in town (we're from Houston) so we could see and remember the venue layout. All of our guests were impressed and loved the setting. We loved the beautiful, historic touches and diversity of the space, from the enclosed courtyard to the cupola overlooking Jackson Square. It was the perfect place!

The LPBMM was just absolutely gorgeous on the day of our wedding. We got ready in the cottage, married on the dock, and the reception was held upstairs in an event space. Everything was wonderful and the staff was helpful and flexible throughout the night. Lora Haddox made the process of setting everything up incredibly easy for us as our special day approached.

We thoroughly enjoyed having our Louisiana Wedding weekend kickoff with our Rehearsal Dinner at ArtSpace. It was a fantastic space to show our friends and loved ones the culture of Louisiana and a prized piece of our Shreveport downtown. The cocktail hour was great, and our guests were well refreshed. It was great to move the festivities upstairs for dinner, and we enjoyed the tasty Louisiana cuisine catered by the in-house catering company, Southern Fork. Cheers to a great rehearsal dinner!

The pharmacy museum was the perfect setting for our wedding ceremony. The staff were so helpful and welcoming. The courtyard was absolutely stunning and made it feel so secluded— even though the location is right on the middle of everything. I couldn’t imagine getting married anywhere else and definitely recommend it!’
