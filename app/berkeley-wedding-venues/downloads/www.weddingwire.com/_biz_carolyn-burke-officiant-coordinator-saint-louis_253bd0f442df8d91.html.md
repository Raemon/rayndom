## About

**Marriage License Signing Service in Kirkwood, Missouri**  
**An alternative to the county courthouse. Fees starts at $50.  
****For faster response, call or text 314-669-4933.  
Visit the website : www.ElopeInStLouis.com  
**

Sometimes love is about getting straight down to making your marriage legal. If you and your partner have decided to skip a formal ceremony and just want to be legally married, I can help you with this. Meet in Kirkwood MO, provide two witnesses (in some cases) and your marriage license from Missouri.

A marriage license signing ceremony is an alternative to being married in the courthouse (and more convenient too!). When you have your marriage license paperwork, reach out to me and we can schedule a time in which to get together in Kirkwood, MO (like a coffee shop, restaurant, or park) to legalize your union. The whole thing will last as long as it takes for me to fill out the paperwork and have the two witnesses sign it.

Absolutely amazing service 

We had such a great experience with her. Called in last minute when there were issues at the court house and she was there like 40 minutes later to save the day. Very very nice and lively, would absolutely recommend her.

Carolyn was absolutely wonderful

Carolyn officiated our wedding ceremony. At the rehearsal, she was organized, knew exactly where to guide everyone and got us all prepared for the next day. At the ceremony, she was full of energy and certainly made our moment at the podium even more special. Would recommend her without a doubt.

Wonderful!!

I had a hard time finding the right officiant but when I found Carolyn, I was so relieved! We did the deluxe elopement package and it was perfect! The quality of the flowers and photographs are outstanding! Carolyn is so nice and she made us feel comfortable. She even made me laugh too! Carolyn is professional and prompt. I can't say enough good things about this experience! I highly recommend her!!!

We hired Carolyn as our wedding officiant and were extremely pleased with her services. We discussed everything over the phone with her prior to booking. Her policies were very clear, and she provided us with all of the information we needed well in advance of our ceremony. She allows couples to add customized readings, ceremonies, etc. to their events, but we wanted a short and sweet ceremony, and that’s exactly what we got! We had a phone rehearsal the day prior to the event, where she explained exactly what she would do from the time she arrived to the time she left the venue. We also went over pronunciation and preferences for how we’d be introduced, details about the wedding party, etc.. She was very professional, but also fun, and her pricing is very reasonable. We would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for an officiant!
