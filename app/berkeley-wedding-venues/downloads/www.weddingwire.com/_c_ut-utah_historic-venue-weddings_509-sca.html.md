Courtney was amazing and super easy to communicate with while planning my wedding! I set up 3 different times to meet with her to see the space, see how a few of my decorations looked on the tables, and even to practice my father daughter dance! The building was so spacious and matched the exact feel I wanted my guests to have! I could not have asked for a better experience for this special day. I highly recommend this space to anyone holding any kind of event!

The Lion House was the perfect place to host our immediate family wedding luncheon. We wanted something small but refined, and this place was just right. We had our luncheon in the Garden Room, which we highly recommend - the room was very beautiful. The food was phenomenal! Our guests still talk about how delicious the food was - and they were very accommodating to some slight variations we requested in our menu selection. Our event coordinator was incredible - she was very attentive and polite, and helped make our luncheon the best it could be. The only letdown was their music system was temporarily down, so we had to enjoy our luncheon without pleasant background music. The Lion House is an excellent choice for a wonderful wedding luncheon. NOTE: The entry for the Lion House Banquets/Events is through the front, the entry for the Pantry/Cafe is on the left.

The venue is elegant and historic and (due to its recent opening) still fairly unknown to local guests, which made it a wonderful destination. Amy was so helpful getting tables and linens ordered and set up and answering all of our questions along the way. Couldn't have been more pleased with how our event went! Highly recommend Moonlight Lighting lights on the balcony and gelato there as well on a summer evening. Magical.

Hearthside was amazing to work with. We had our ceremony, reception and they also catered our luncheon, all for a reasonable price. Ruth was able to answer all of our questions and wanted to help make our day perfect. They did set up, clean up, centerpieces, tablecloths and had a few other decorations for us to use. All of our guests loved how beautiful it was there, and enjoyed the food. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a beautiful affordable venue. It was the perfect venue for the perfect day!

This is such an elegant venue in Memory Grove Park! We have attended many events here and it's always a great experience. The staff are friendly, the surrounding park is beautiful, there is ample parking for a downtown venue and I hope to book an event here in the future!
