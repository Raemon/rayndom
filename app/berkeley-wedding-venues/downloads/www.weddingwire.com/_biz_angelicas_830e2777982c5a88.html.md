The best place to get married!

We got married here, and I can truly say it was the most perfect place and support we could ever ask for! Our day felt like a dream coming true from beginning to end.  
Crystal was absolutely excellent — so organized, calm, punctual, intelligent, and incredibly kind. She brought such peace and confidence to our day. Truly an angel!  
Angelical created all the floral arrangements, and it was the most beautiful décor I have ever seen. Every flower was placed with so much love and intention. The team worked flawlessly with every wedding detail — the food, the decorations, the flower arrangements — always showing so much love and care in everything they do. You can truly feel their passion.  
  
Everyone was organized, aligned, and attentive, making our entire wedding flow effortlessly. I would get married there 1,000 times again with my husband because it was the most beautiful night of my life. I recommend them with all my heart! 💖✨   
  
The foods, the staff, the decorations, my BOUQUET, the drinks EVERYTHING was speechless!!! ❤️🤩❤️

Awesome team and awesome venue!

Angelica's is such an amazing place to have our wedding, and we feel so lucky to have Crystal meticulously organize and coordinate everything for us for the event, from menu selection, floral design, wine pairing, and table/venue setting up, to rehearsal and on-the-day coordination. Crystal and Angelica are extremely accomondating and flexible, actively willing to offer assistance and provide valuable suggestions. All of your guests, vendors, and, most importantly, the most nervous people of the day, you and your loved one, will always be welcomed and soothed by the composure of Crystal and her fast-acting service team. You are in great hands with the Angelica's team to have your once-in-a-life experience and happy moments there.

Espectacular! La mejor elección !!

Revisé varias opciones antes de elegir Angelica’s, sus precios se adaptaron a mi presupuesto, la comida estuvo INCREÍBLE, el trato fue de lo mejor!! Crystal es extremadamente amable, me acompañó en todo el proceso y el día de la boda estuvo pendiente de hasta el más mínimo detalle, lo cual se agradece, ya que permitió que nos centráramos más en disfrutar. Por último, el lugar es precioso, el servicio fue muy bueno, los meseros muy amables también, sin duda los volvería a contratar para otro evento, los recomiendo ampliamente !!!

Wedding Review

We had a short timeframe to plan our wedding—just five months—and we were so lucky to come across Angelicas on a couple of wedding websites. It instantly became our top choice. While we were rushing to find a venue, nothing felt as magical as discovering Angelicas. We loved that it’s family-owned; it genuinely made us feel at home.  
  
Crystal made the entire planning process a breeze and walked us through every step. She helped us think through details we hadn’t even considered and was always open and supportive of any ideas we brought up. She also shared a list of preferred vendors, which was incredibly helpful—we ended up hiring one of them as our DJ.  
  
When our wedding day arrived, everything ran smoothly. Crystal and the Angelicas team were attentive, efficient, and clearly invested in making sure couples have an amazing experience. Every time we saw a staff member, they were smiling.  
  
Cocktail hour was beautifully organized. The patio was warmly lit and heated, which made all the difference on a cold, rainy night. Our guests kept raving about the ambiance, the food, and the garden setting—especially how magical everything looked at night. Fan favorites included the tostadas and the Pink Señorita drink. For dinner, we chose a buffet, which flowed perfectly and offered plenty of variety. We also added a late-night snack option, which was a huge hit and perfect for guests who needed a little boost before heading home.  
  
Thank you again to Crystal and the entire Angelicas team for helping make our day truly special!

Made my dream come true!

We hosted our wedding at Angelica’s, and it was truly the best decision we made for the entire celebration. The venue is absolutely beautiful, with a warm, intimate charm that our guests couldn’t stop raving about. It’s also incredibly affordable for what you get — genuinely the best value for money we found after months of searching.  
The food and drinks were outstanding, every bit as amazing as the restaurant’s reputation suggests. Many guests told us it was the best wedding meal (and drinks) they’ve ever had.  
Our coordinator, Crystal, was a dream to work with. She’s attentive to every detail, flexible, communicative, and always two steps ahead. We couldn’t have done it without her — she made the entire planning process so smooth.  
The florals were also done by the venue - they were elegant, exactly how i've imagined them to be, and elevated the entire ambience, tying everything together beautifully.  
If you’re considering Angelica’s for your wedding, don’t hesitate. It was perfect in every way!!

Dreamy wedding experience!

We had an incredible experience with Angelica's as our wedding venue. From start to finish, everything was handled with care, professionally, and with attention to detail. The biggest highlight was working with Crystal, who was amazing. She made sure everything was organized, planned every detail, and was very supportive with any questions or suggestions during the planning.  
  
Angelica's also took care of our florals, and they nailed it. The venue looked stunning. They listened to our requirements and made sure that everything was perfectly aligned with our vision. The bouquet was especially beautiful!  
  
The food and drinks were another highlight. We appreciated the menu tasting ahead of the wedding, and everything was delicious and beautifully presented. They took care and consideration to accommodate our guests' dietary restrictions.  
  
If you are looking for a venue with a vibrant setting, a dedicated coordinator, the best staff, and top-notch food and drinks, we can't recommend Angelica's enough. They made our wedding day truly unforgettable.

Perfect wedding venue

Hosted my son’s wedding at Angelica’s and It was perfect from beginning to end. The staff was so accommodating during the planning and at the actual event. Service was top notch all my guests felt totally attended to, food was amazing better than anticipated, bar tender was fantastic and super engaging. We actually had the ceremony in the garden room and then went straight into happy hour and dinner which was perfect for my out of town guests. Venue is beautiful all my guests commented how much they loved it. Crystal and Angelica are so accommodating and make you feel at home in their establishment. Angelica’s are arranged for all the flowers and gave me exactly what I asked for based on two pictures. I would not change one thing about the day. This wedding was planned in a 2 month period of time and came off like it was a year of planning. Crystal took all the stress out of planning for me and guided me the whole time.

Amazing! Dream Wedding 

We have nothing but amazing things to say about our experience with Angelica's for our most special day! We had our wedding at Angelica's this past November, and from the moment we met Crystal, we knew we had found the perfect venue. Crystal truly understood our vision from the very beginning and helped bring it to life flawlessly. Everything exceeded our expectations, and we couldn’t be happier with how the day turned out. We highly recommend Angelica's for weddings or any special occasion!

Christmas Wedding at Angelica's

We would get married at Angelica's 100 times again. From end to end the event was perfect. Crystal the event manager was incredible. She is professional and works so hard to make the event come to life. The entire staff at Angelica's was wonderful to work with. We had our wedding reception in the main dining room and also cocktail hour in the back patio. Our wedding was an absolute Christmas dream thanks to Crystal and the entire Angelica's staff! We had a blast, the food and drinks were amazing and our guests raved about it, the decor was perfect, the dance floor and DJ was easy to work with, and Crystal made sure every detail was attended to. I could not recommend this restaurant more highly for weddings or any events you want to host and have you and your guests be completely happy.
