Ghislaine (“Gigi”) – Caribbean Blue Wedding Planning We hosted our daughter’s destination wedding in Curaçao in November, and I can say without hesitation that Ghislaine (“Gigi”) from Caribbean Blue was the single best decision we made in the entire planning process. About a year before the wedding, we interviewed Gigi and immediately knew she was the right person. From day one, she was organized, responsive, thoughtful, and completely tuned in to our daughter’s vision. Her communication was constant and clear, and she truly listened—not just to what was being said, but to the feeling and intention behind the dream wedding our daughter had imagined. Gigi has an incredible ability to take a vision and translate it into what’s realistically possible on the island—while still making it feel magical. She was creative when needed, resourceful when challenges arose, and seamlessly pulled together a series of flawless events for nearly 100 guests. Every event was outstanding: • Welcome drinks and a white-party celebration at Soi 95 • A beautiful rehearsal dinner at Avila Hotel’s Blues (over-the-water restaurant) • And finally, the wedding itself at Avila’s Octagon, which was absolutely breathtaking Not a single event missed the mark. Everything ran smoothly, on time, and without stress—for us, for our daughter, or for our guests. People are still raving about how incredible the entire experience was. Gigi didn’t just plan a wedding—she helped create lifelong memories for our family and friends. If you are considering a wedding or event in Curaçao, look no further than Ghislaine and Caribbean Blue. She is a true professional and an absolute joy to work with.

There is not enough word to Describes how grateful we are to Gina and the team at LOOF for how perfect they made our Vow Renewal. Gine Came highly recommended from many people we knew on the Island ( My wife and I are from NY so it was a destination vow renewal). From the first meeting, we knew we wanted LOOF to Decorate our Event. Gina was Patient, Kind, made us feel comfortable and most importantly listened and gave great advice to achieve the look we were going for. She was very helpful in making sure we got what we wanted and how best to achieve that with the budget we had in place. Regardless of how far away we were Gina answered all our questions and she also helped resolve many unexpected challenges that weren't even related to LOOF. We did alot of research and resched out to many vendors when looking for a decorator, and we just felt like a number. Give Gina a call you will not be disappointed. LOOF went the extra mile in every way. All in all, I would confidently say they are the Best on the Island Bar NONE!!

I honestly don’t have enough words to thank Marilse from Celebrations for the incredible work they did for my birthday event. From the very beginning, I felt as if Marilse was my right hand not only professionally, but with heart and soul. She took the time to plan meetings, understand my vision, follow up on every detail, and stay fully informed about all my ideas from décor and music to entertainment and the overall experience. She guided me with honest advice, structure, and clarity. I truly don’t know what I would have done without her. Marilse is strict, correct, and highly professional and that is exactly what makes her so strong in her work. On the day of my celebration, she and her team ensured everything flowed perfectly according to the tight schedule. With so much entertainment and a detailed program, I never once felt that timing was off or that something was forgotten. Everything was flawless. I am deeply grateful that I was able to organize my birthday with her. I will recommend Celebrations and Marilse to everyone! she is experienced, dedicated, and truly knows how to bring an event to perfection. Marilse, from the bottom of my heart: thank you for creating such a beautiful and unforgettable day!

Words cannot fully capture the outstanding experience I had with KCEvents. Donna's expertise, promptness, and meticulous attention to detail brought my vision to life in a way that surpassed all expectations. From the moment I shared my ideas, Donna and her team worked seamlessly to execute every detail without a single hiccup. When I walked into the venue for my beach-themed birthday dinner, I was completely blown away. The setting was immaculate, from the table arrangements to the backdrop and welcome sign. My guests were equally speechless, and the entire evening was nothing short of magical. I am forever grateful to Donna and the entire KC Events team for turning my dream into a reality. Their dedication made my night unforgettable, and I will always highly recommend their services to anyone seeking exceptional event planning in Curaçao. Thank you so much, KC Events—I look forward to working with you again in the future!

Gwyn and Ryan helped us to have the perfect vow renewal for our 20th wedding anniversary. They followed my wishes perfectly. Each vendor they used was amazing and helped us to have the vow renewal we had dreamed of! I felt completely at ease throughout the entire process, with them handling things. They thought of all the little details that made the evening so special. I highly recommend trusting them to handle your special day! 💓

I can't believe that I ever thought I could manage our destination wedding without the support of an experienced local professional. Once we met with Matsy from Eventi Diverso, we immediately felt relaxed and confident that she would help to make our wedding exactly what we envisioned. Matsy knows everyone and everything on the island - her recommendations for bakery, DJ, and photographer were all amazing. Matsy took the planning stress off us and allowed us to focus on the big details while she organized everything else. We truly could not have done it without her. The extra details she added during our wedding day truly amazed us and made our wedding feel more special than we could have ever expected. Matsy is fun and easy to work with – we came away with not only an amazing wedding but a new friend in Curacao. We would highly recommend Matsy for your wedding or event in Curacao!
