Shawn and Michelle with DJ7 Evan’s were amazing to work with. They really helped facilitate our reception, I got to pick out the music I wanted, and Shawn MC’d our wedding shoe game! They were fun, took care of us, and helped make a memorable evening. If I got married every day, I would use them every time. Also, very reasonably priced!!

We were very happy with booking DJ connection. We ended up getting DJ Tasha, who knew our venue well, got the party started right by teaching our guests some dance moves, then kept the dancing going the rest of the night. We thought DJ connection was the right price, and overall we got great value in booking them.

Best people that I've ever worked with! The DJ (Julian) went above and beyond to make our day special! for the price he gave us, it felt like we were at a concert. He kept the crowd entertained and engaged and the dance floor never had less than 20 people on it and when the DJ showed us his moves EVERYONE was blown away! The way he mixed the songs were so smooth we barely noticed the song changed. We'll no doubt remember this night for the rest of our lives. Highly recommend!

Oklahoma Live Productions is a great company with wonderful people running it! Kiersten is organized and professional and made sure our day went perfect! She was helpful with her suggestions and listened to everything I wanted and made it happen! Our day wouldn’t have been the same without her! I cannot recommend them enough!

Santiago was really flexible and had a great vibe! He arrived early to set up and the guests were feeling the music. The equipment played the music with great quality! He can either provide a playlist or he is happy to work off of the couple's playlist. We would definitely reccomend him he was very kind, understanding, and professional.

OKC Mobile DJs was an absolutely fabulous choice for our wedding reception. So many of the other DJs we talked to were really obnoxious or pushy, but Steven was so kind and easy to communicate with. He honored all of our requests and kept everything moving right on time, and he played banger after banger to keep people on the dance floor throughout the night. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a good DJ who will make your reception a great time and smooth from start to finish.

Joel was our DJ at our wedding and he did a wonderful job! We were pretty hands-off for the most part in our planning for our music and he came up with a great playlist that kept people on the dance floor. He was also flexible and was able to play last minute song requests/changes. Very satisfied with his service and would 10/10 recommend!

At first we decided not to get a professional DJ. We were just going to play our own music. Then we met Ray. Ray helped us coordinate our wedding timeline as he made suggestions to keep the party going. During our wedding ceremony, Ray took our songs and our vision and made it a beautiful reality. He kept the vibe going during dinner. Then at the reception he was the BEST Master of Ceremonies as he kept the guest dancing and entertained. A big thanks to K and R, we have memories that will last a lifetime.
