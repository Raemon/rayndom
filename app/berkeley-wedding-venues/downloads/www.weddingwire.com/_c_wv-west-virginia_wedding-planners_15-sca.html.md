Amanda was our day-of-coordinator and we were so happy that we met her and chose her to be such a huge help and part of our special day! She has had so much experience and is so well-prepared that we felt like we didn't have to worry about a thing!-- Which is priceless to me! I didn't want my mom and family having to worry about taking care of things on my big day and Amanda really helped ease all of our minds and allow us to truly enjoy the day without worrying about all the details! She is very professional, super organized and again, her experience over the years really shows! Amanda thinks of all the little things, too! She was even willing to allow us to use some of the items she has collected over the years for our reception. I am a very detail-oriented person, and knowing that what I wanted mattered as much to her as it did to me, was really something I appreciated. She was a pleasure to get to know and work with and I would most definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a wedding coordinator!

David and Stephanie were amazing for us to work with! They were kind and made us both feel very comfortable. Their timing and elegance in setting up our venue was top notch. They were engaging and kept everyone on time to take all the stress away from us on our wedding day. They worked great with all of our vendors and made everyone feel comfortable. We could not have asked for a better company and planners to work with!

Words cannot express my gratitude for Infinity Studios. My wedding was everything we wanted it to be! It was the PERFECT wedding and it's all because of them. When I first called Carmela I was frantic. My wedding was a few months away and nothing was done except sending invitations out pretty much. Carmela put me at east immediately and her and Brian met with me to talk about details. I am not much of a decorator, I left pretty much all of that up to Carmela. I came to them with a simple idea and they worked their magic and brought it to life. I have high anxiety and I worry A LOT. I texted her a few times (saying that lightly lol) with unexpected changes and issues that I thought were just detrimental… and she just would just tell me “I got it”… she was always so calm and took care of everything I threw at her like it was nothing. Carmela is a top-notch planner and I am incredibly lucky to have had her help. She always made us feel as though she had everything 100% under control. Both Carmela and Brian are like a design genius’s! They made me beautiful rustic doors for my outdoor wedding and a very elegant arch that I just LOVED. It's like she was reading my mind!! Oh and did I mention that I got married at the very top if a mountain? LOL they handled that like pros... I'm pretty sure its not an easy task to haul an entire wedding site to the top of a mountain where the only way to get up there is by ski lift. They acted like it was nothing, they make things happen. I loved everything she came up with! She respected my input and added her special touches to my ideas. The day of the wedding ran so smoothly. Everything, every person, every moment... She also hit me with a pleasant surprise that she does make up too! She did my make up and all my bridesmaids make up. We all loved it. She even used special techniques best for taking photos and from looking at my photos, she knew what she was doing. Carmela and Brian were very genuine and very nice people. Carmela was

Lauren and Scott are incredible! We hired Lauren as our day of wedding coordinator primarily to set up decor at our DIY reception venue, but Lauren did so much more and exceeded our expectations in every way. Several weeks before the wedding she met with us to discuss our vision and then immediately began reaching out to all off our vendors to make sure everyone was on the same page. I’m a very type A person and find it difficult to delegate tasks. However, Lauren’s attention to detail matched mine perfectly and i felt comfortable letting her take over in the days leading up to the wedding, saving me valuable time. Not only was she the backbone of our wedding day, she was there to coordinate the rehearsal as well. On the wedding day Lauren and Scott executed our design beautifully (there were several hundred items) and directed the vendors as needed. Lauren then came to the church to lead the bridal party through the ceremony. When we arrived at the reception it was pouring rain, so we sent our transportation home. Within 15 minutes it stopped raining and we were able to get pictures at a nearby location - Scott himself drove us in his personal vehicle to get these priceless photos. Later, when my caterer became overwhelmed and refused to plate our cookies and put together the cookie table as they were contracted to do, it was Lauren and Scott who saved the day and put our cookie table together. Lastly, as our venue was DIY, we had to break everything down and take it with us after the wedding. Unexpectedly, Lauren and Scott were the ones that helped my husband and I clean up the entire venue - at 12:30am we were the last four standing. I can not recommend them enough - they are worth their weight in gold! Please, do yourself a favor and hire Ren+Ott for your next event!
