We loved this venue and all our memories from our wedding. We worked with Narod who helped in all communication. We also got help from Ryan in AV. They were both so easy going and great to work with! We loved how beautiful the setup is. The ceremony outside was so nice. The Redwood Hall is also so gorgeous for photos and fun for dancing. We also really liked the cocktail area. We got an animal ambassador and guests had fun seeing the ferret and kestrel. We got nothing but compliments related to how fun the venue was. We are so happy we chose this place for our wedding. We loved the experience. Thank you to CuriOdyssey for going above and beyond. From communication early on to day of. It was amazing!

Thank YOU for helping make our Engagement Party so special! It was truly a joy working with Rachel and the amazing team at the Crowne Plaza! From the moment we arrived, we were met with such helpfulness and support. Every question we had was answered quickly, and all of our (sometimes last-minute!) requests were handled with such flexibility and care. Your team was incredibly hands-on and truly committed to making sure everything was set up just the way we envisioned. It really felt like everyone was there to support us, and that made a huge difference in our experience. That same level of care and support was felt throughout the entire event, and it gave us so much peace of mind to know we were in such good hands! (My whole family felt the support)♥️ The staff was so kind, professional, and attentive. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience. I’ve gone through the invoice and everything looks good on our end. If anything comes up, I’ll definitely reach out. Thanks again for being such a big part of this special time in our lives. We truly appreciate all your support and hope we get to work together again in the future!

I am really impressed by the customer service and professionalism exhibited by Amanda and the Marriott team. This is a beautiful and well maintained (recently upgraded as well). This is truly a venue where all dreams of the bride and groom will come true. Good luck to this team.

Recently had my "minimony" here. We originally had planned our wedding to be in May, but because of Covid we had to postpone until October. They were very accommodating and flexible with changing my dates. They were responsive and helpful. I can't wait to come back next year for our big celebration with our whole family!

We are so glad we picked CSM and the Bayview Dining Room for our wedding ceremony and reception. Unlike some of the other venues we toured, the dining area is big and airy. It has floor-to-ceiling glass windows/walls that provide great views of the bay and blue sky above. Our guest list was pretty small, so we had tons of extra room, but the set-up staff made it work really well, filling the space with extra bar tables and couches with coffee tables to provide a variety of areas for mingling and lounging. Between the patio, the main dining area, the dance floor, and the bar/lounge areas, our guests had tons of space and options, and they used it all. We had our ceremony here, too. The fountain provided a very nice backdrop, and the balcony allowed our photographer to get some neat shots of the ceremony and all our guests from above. We were lucky to have pretty much perfect weather on our big day, and our guests couldn't stop talking about the view. They loved taking pictures on the patio with the bay and blue sky behind them. Both prior to and on the big day, Allison was great to work with. She was easily accessible via email, quickly answered any and all questions, and was very friendly and accommodating. On the day itself, the setup and catering/bar staff members were great, too. They were efficient, friendly, and helpful. We were very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food, both at the tasting and on the wedding day. Many of our guests shared how much they enjoyed the meal - especially the ice cream sundae bar! On the booze front, we provided the alcohol and mixers for the bar, which likely saved a lot of money; the corkage fees were very reasonable and the bar staff were friendly and kept the drinks flowing. Overall, CSM and Pacific Dining were a great choice for us. The space was excellent, the rates were very reasonable, the food was great, and the staff was friendly and helpful. We had a fabulous day!
