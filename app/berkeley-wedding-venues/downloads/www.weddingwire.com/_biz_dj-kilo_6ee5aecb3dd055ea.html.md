Book DJ Kilo! 

We hired DJ Kilo for our wedding reception (Sept. 2025), and he and his lovely wife (the MC) were the most critical part of making the night a massive success. We couldn't recommend them enough!  
  
From the initial planning stages, DJ Kilo and his wife were a pleasure to work with—organized, and genuinely listened to our vision for the evening. They took time to understand our "must-play" tracks and, more importantly, the general vibe we wanted to achieve.  
  
If you are looking for a DJ and MC duo who bring a massive amount of positive, engaging energy and professionalism to your event, then DJ Kilo is the right choice.

Great job!

Kwamane did an awesome job as a DJ at my daughter’s wedding. He took care of the music at the ceremony and the reception. He arrived early and stayed late. He kept the guests on the dance floor the whole night. I would be glad to use him in the future.
