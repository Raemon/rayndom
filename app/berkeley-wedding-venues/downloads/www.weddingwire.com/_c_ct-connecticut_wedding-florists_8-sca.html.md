Our wedding flowers were absolutely beautiful! I loved working with Terri and her team. She was respectful of our budget while still being incredibly creative and flexible with our requests. Terri did an amazing job listening to my likes and vision and translating them into something even better than I imagined. The décor flowers were bright yet fall-inspired, adding the perfect seasonal touch, while my bouquet was more muted and elegant — exactly what I wanted. Every detail felt thoughtful and intentional. I cannot recommend Terri Krisavage enough. I only wish I had more events to work with her on!

The owner was incredibly sweet whenever we talked on the phone about details and was incredibly understanding of my lower budget. I was really basic in my concepts (very simple, white flowers), and she was amazing at creating gorgeous bouquets & boutonnieres that were better than my wildest imagination. She came and delivered everything herself, as I believe I might have been her last bridal client. I wish her all of the best!

They did a fantastic job with the bouquets and all flowers over all! They brought the flowers to the bridal suite at the Aqua Turf, they were in vases or at least some source of water to keep them fresh. We loved meeting with Virginia and the staff prior to the wedding. We kept in touch with phone calls and emails. We had a lot of compliments about how beautiful the flowers were !

Phil was a preferred vendor of our venue, and my wedding manager truly could not stop raving about him. After my very first appointment with Phil, I could understand why! Going into that first meeting, I knew absolutely nothing about flowers. I had a few inspiration photos and knew the color scheme I wanted, but I had no idea about flower types or arrangements. Phil walked me through everything with such honesty and expertise. He would look at an inspiration photo and say, “I can get you that flower if you want it, but it’s a bit expensive. Let me show you a very similar alternative that I love that’s cheaper.” When I mentioned wanting candles around the centerpieces, he even told me, “You can get candles through me, but it will be more expensive than if you buy them yourself. If you purchase your own, we’ll happily set them up for you.” He also offered to set up candles along our staircase, which was such a thoughtful touch! It was immediately clear how knowledgeable and incredibly talented Phil is. I showed him photos and shared my color scheme, and he instantly began suggesting flower types that would best match my vision, my dress style, my bridesmaids’ dresses, and the overall aesthetic, all while showing me photos and examples of how everything could come together. I left that appointment knowing I wanted to work with him and only him. I trusted his judgment, his opinions, and felt completely comfortable putting everything in his hands, which meant so much to me as someone who knew nothing about florals. Leading up to the wedding, Phil was always responsive, patient, and accommodating with my many questions and changes. On the day of the wedding, when I saw the bouquets, corsages, boutonnieres, centerpieces, and chapel arrangements, I was truly SPEECHLESS. Everything was absolutely STUNNING! He executed my vision more beautifully than I could have ever imagined. Long story short: book Phil for all of your floral needs!! He is not only incredibly talented, but also a genuinely wonderful person. I cannot recommend him enough!!

Collette is everything you could ask for a vendor— prompt, attentive, kind, patient, and so talented! She went out of her way to make me feel cared for and attended to throughout the entire planning process. She is extremely responsive, worked so well with our venue and other vendors, and was truly such a delight to work with. Not to mention, the floral arrangements she and her team created were absolutely STUNNING. I would recommend Collette’s services to anyone!!

We used Haworth's for our March 2025 wedding. I knew I wanted our florals for our wedding party to be done by a professional, and Jenn and her team were the perfect fit. Their shop is charming, and the team is warm, professional, and a breeze to work with. They executed our vision perfectly, and we could not be more thrilled with the results. I would highly reccommend them to anyone!

Luisa and the staff at Ruth Chase Flowers exceed my expectations in every way. With a knack for patient listening they have been able to take my ideas on more than one occasion and transform them into a beautiful floral piece. They are professional kind, and, no matter how busy, I never feel rushed. Just stepping into the store is a calming and uplifting experience. Their flowers and arranging work are the highest quality.

Deb and her team are so much more than florists, they really take time and effort to create an entire event. With less than 2 months lead time, A Gala Affair managed to put together the romantic vibe I was looking for. Jill made wonderful suggestions that I would not have considered myself but they turned out to really make our wedding extra special and memorable. They also worked with me to transfer bouquets from the ceremony to the reception to keep the costs reasonable. On the day of the wedding, Deb and her team worked tirelessly to ensure a perfect execution of our vision, including an impeccable breakdown of everything after the wedding was over.I highly recommend A Gala Affair for an exceptional wedding or event, they are true professionals.
