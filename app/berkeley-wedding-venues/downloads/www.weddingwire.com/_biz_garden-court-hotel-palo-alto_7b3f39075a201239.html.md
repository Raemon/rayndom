Great Venue

We had our 90-person wedding at el PRADO, and our guests loved the charming ambiance of the venue! The food and drinks were great as well. A special shoutout to Sherry, our event coordinator, for going above and beyond to address our questions and concerns along the way!

Beautiful Wedding Venue in Bay Area

el PRADO absolutely exceeded our expectations!   
  
So many of our guests (family AND friends) told us el PRADO was beautiful. Our moms specifically were wow'd by the opening of the ballroom at the end of the cocktail hour, and our foodie relatives loved the food! (which means a lot as they can be very... critical).  
  
Sherry took great care of us through all the planning, and both her and her staff were flawless and flexible in their day-of execution. We were able to fully immerse ourselves in the celebration with our guests, which means so much to us.

Awesome Hidden Gem

We were looking for a perfect indoor venue near Palo Alto for our wedding of ~125. We decided to have both the ceremony and reception on-site and we could not have been happier.  
  
We were so lucky to find el Prado and be able to work with Jesse. Our experience was incredible -- from the best reception food ever (for real), to the quaint vibes of the hotel, to Jesse's guidance and help in the planning process, we could not be happier.   
  
If you're looking for a hidden gem in Palo Alto, check this place out!

FIVE STARS in Every Aspect of a Wedding Venue!

9/15/2024:  
Our wedding reception at this venue was truly exceptional – better than we could have ever imagined. Highly recommend!  
  
The Team:  
It all started with Jesse’s impeccable planning and coordination. His expertise and attention to detail were a huge relief, making the entire process seamless and stress-free.   
  
The Venue:  
El Prado’s courtyard and patio are simply stunning. With its large fireplace lit at night, beautiful Spanish-style balconies and string lights, the ambiance created a beautiful, global, and inclusive atmosphere that made the evening unforgettable.  
  
The Food:  
As many others have mentioned, the food was incredible – some of the best you can get at a wedding! The steak and salmon were fantastic, and the hors d'oeuvres, especially the lamb and twice-baked potatoes, were a big hit. We also used the second-floor lounge for an after-party, which was absolutely perfect.  
  
Accommodations:  
Having the venue as a hotel was the icing on the cake. Our family was able to stay together in the rooms, adding so much convenience and comfort to the celebration.  
  
Overall:  
Our experience was nothing short of amazing, and we couldn't have asked for more. Highly recommend for anyone looking to host an event here!

11/14/2023:  
Jesse, the events director at el PRADO, is exceptionally diligent, responsive, organized, and kind! We are only at the early stages of wedding planning (we'll update this review later), but we wanted to write a review just to emphasize how meaningful it is to us to have someone like Jesse on our team. We've learned that the role of the events lead at one's wedding venue is critical from the very beginning – Jesse never made us feel rushed during our walk-through, sent a simple sample quote in a clean and easy to adjust Excel sheet so we could estimate costs quickly, compartmentalized the steps of venue planning so we could focus on what matters at the initial contract stage, and was flexible with us to ensure we had everything we needed.

Simply the Best

El Prado Hotel is absolutely beautiful. We were set on an outdoor wedding from the beginning of our engagement- thinking that was the only way to include our dogs in the ceremony.. but I was wrong. El Prado is hugely dog-friendly! To be honest, my then-fiance didn't even want to look at el prado it wasn't what we originally envisioned for our day but once we stepped on the property and saw how beautiful the hotel was- the small, intimate vibe, the aesthetics, the colors, the choices in furniture and everything- we just fell in love with the venue. Our original plan was to get married in March (off-season.. cheaper) but we learned that el prado doesn't have different prices for different months or days of the week! WHAT?! We were soo excited to hear that! They only have a minimum food & beverage cost. SOLD. We get a beautiful venue, in July, on a Saturday evening for nothing extra.   
  
The team at el Prado, especially Jesse, were our heroes! Jesse answers all emails quickly, promptly, and with humor. He went above and beyond ensuring our wedding day went smoothly- coordinating with all the vendors, and making sure the things I prepared are placed and prepped in the correct areas. Our guests were so impressed by the service of everyone. And these family members go to A LOT of weddings and they help out at pretty much all of them so it's with HIGH praise when they were impressed with the level of service and competencies of everyone at el prado.   
  
It's not the cheapest out there but I'd pay for quality and the peace of mind that everyone is working to ensure we have the best day possible. And it was absolutely perfect. I mean don't all brides and grooms think their day is perfect? But ours was perfect, not just to us but to so many of our guests who came gushing about our day. Some even said it was better than their own wedding. *beams* it's everyone working together to make our vision come to life.

el PRADO as a wedding venue is an absolute dream!

We found el PRADO Hotel through WeddingWire in the summer of 2021 when we first got engaged; they were going through a remodeling and let us stop by for a quick tour even before they were reopened. We had already toured other wedding venues but we were pretty impressed by the layout of the boutique hotel and fell in love with the architecture and all the little cute nooks that we knew would be absolutely fantastic for photographs. When they had a soft reopening later that year in the fall, we visited again for another tour just to see how things had been updated and heard about all the plans.   
  
The Director of Events, Jesse Bresnahan, has been such a key player in our decision to book our wedding at el PRADO. el PRADO was probably the 6th or 7th venue we had toured and we hadn’t really been to one that we really walked in and felt comfortable saying yes to right away. el PRADO was exactly that. The combination of a super sweet staff and lovely setup and environment of the hotel even before setting up any wedding decor really vibed with us. We were pretty set on booking el PRADO after visiting a couple times and speaking with Jesse. Jesse has been extremely patient with our millions of questions (we have email threads of 40-50+ emails back and forth with him about wedding planning), is always professional about everything, was such a positive force during our planning, and guided us through a lot of decisions we had to make for our wedding.  
  
We were able to start drafting a contract for our wedding to book our date (well in advance) by December 2021 and just had to wait on a couple things before signing it, but Jesse made sure that all of our concerns and questions were addressed and worked with us over email and phone calls to get our contract just how we needed it; we booked el PRADO 12 months in advance of our wedding and felt so comfortable and excited about our decision!  
  
Sarah Rennert also started helping us with rooming blocks and wedding planning questions mid-2022 in the midst of all of our planning. Both her and Jesse were just phenomenal pillars of support for us. It was so great to meet her on our wedding weekend and she helped us get what we needed whenever we needed it.  
  
el PRADO as a wedding venue is an absolute dream! The entire staff was extremely hospitable, everyone we encountered was so warm and welcoming and always put a smile on our faces. They let us set up for our wedding ahead of time (we did a lot of DIY decor since our wedding was so specifically themed to a particular video game) and went above and beyond for us from setting up some decor day of for us, plating our dessert donuts (which we were totally just planning to have in the boxes they came in with labels from our vendor), cleaning up our room (the bridal party got ready and made an absolute mess in the Penthouse and by the night of the wedding they had cleaned up the bedroom area and sprinkled a bunch of rose petals on the bed and in the shape of a heart!), and helping us clean up and pack things away after the reception ended.  
  
Jesse kept checking in on me and my partner whatever floor we were on (1st floor lobby/reception, 2nd floor bar area or Biblioteca, 4th floor Penthouse, etc.), made sure we were fed and hydrated, and kept the event going and kept us aware of timing (when to come down for the processional, when to get ready for the reception grand entrance, when do start going around making toasts at all the tables, etc.). Seriously could not have appreciated him more!  
  
During and after our wedding, our guests were just gushing about the venue, staff, and food. We’ve heard from multiple guests that the food for dinner was some of the best, if not the best, food they’d had at a wedding, and they loved how the venue looked!  
  
We had our rehearsal dinner, wedding, and weekend stay at the hotel. If we ever need to hold another big event for whatever reason, we would definitely do it at el PRADO, and we’d absolutely try to find a reason (perhaps an anniversary) to stay at el PRADO again. The Penthouse is gorgeous with its outdoor patio (where we did our first look photos) and has such a lovely bathroom with a rainfall showerhead and a deep soaking tub.  
  
After we booked for our wedding, they opened a Tapas Bar on the 2nd floor and we visited frequently in the months leading up to our wedding. The drinks and bites available daily are delicious!  
  
Highly recommend el PRADO as a place to check out, have an event, do a weekend getaway, grab some drinks, or all of the above! Literally cannot stop thinking about everything, it was everything we could’ve asked for and more!

Best. Wedding. Ever.

Wonderful venue, incredible staff. Delicious food, professional execution. Everything was stinky and Juli Calderon was an absolute dream. Thank you for helping us celebrate the beginning of our marriage with a bang!

Winter Wedding at the Garden Court Hotel-AMAZING!

I absolutely LOVED my experience with the Garden Court Hotel. Jesse Bresnahan, who was our Event Manager, was AMAZING and perhaps a big reason why our wedding was so great. Planning a wedding, as most will figure out soon enough, is extremely stressful, but with Jesse's help, I couldn't be at more ease. He was super responsive, gave tons of details when needed, and had a "can do" attitude for everything. Of course I loved the actual setting, food, and general service at the Garden Court, but I don't think I would have had such a great time planning my wedding if it weren't for Jesse. As an added bonus to the Garden Court, they give you a 5 day stay at a sister hotel in one of their locations in Spain for your honeymoon (which you have a year to use)...unheard of! They also help set it all up for you, so just one less thing to stress about. My husband and I went to Barcelona and of course, it was a trip to remember. Thank you Jesse and Garden Court team for making our wedding what we wanted and more!

An Amazing Wedding Reception Experience

Words can not describe how appreciative I am of Jesse! He was our point of contact throughout of wedding planning process when we selected to host our reception at the Garden Court. Jesse was great in providing us feedback on our plans and making spot on suggestions to make sure everything went off without a hitch.   
  
If you are planning a wedding reception, I highly recommend doing it here - not only is the food amazing (I was getting compliments all night), but the Terrace room on the 2nd floor is absolutely lovely - the beautiful dome windows and private balcony are just perfect for family and friends to take a breather and go outside to chat and get some air during the festivities.   
  
There are also so many amazing perks with hosting a wedding here - among those complimentary stay in one of their lovely suites and also complimentary stay at one of the sister hotels in Spain for 5 nights. I was really touched when we entered our suite at the end of the night and saw rose petals trailing to the bedroom and decorating the bed in the shape of a heart. Everyone I interacted with from the Garden Court was so amazingly sweet and helpful and I received endless compliments on the venue and food.

We had our wedding at the Garden Court Hotel about a month ago and we could not have been happier. We received sooo many compliments about the elegance of the location. Our guests still tell us that the food was AMAZING and it was the best food they've had at a wedding. Seriously! Jesse, the venue's representative, was amazing to work with. A really great guy! He was super accommodating with our requests including working with us to bring in our favorite wine for the reception. He worked with us on getting a room for the groom to get ready in, the day of the wedding. We can't stop gushing about how absolutely beautiful the location was and just how it was all absolutely perfect. Even after the wedding, Jesse and the team were very responsive in helping us book our complimentary honeymoon in Spain (5 free nights in sister hotels in Spain, woohoo!) that comes with having your wedding with them. Thank you Jesse and the Garden Court Hotel.

I love shooting at the Garden Court Hotel in Palo Alto! The staff is highly professional and their clients are treated with the kind of care you'd expect from the best of hotels. Downtown Palo Alto is charming and has great little spots all over for making unique wedding photos. The courtyard at the hotel is stunning and looks amazing at night. You really have to check it out!

Garden Court Hotel is a charming gem in Palo Alto. The rooms are updated and tastefully modern, yet the courtyard has an Old World feel. At night the courtyard looks extra lovely with lamp posts and stringed lights. Wonderfully romantic spot for a wedding and the staff here takes excellent care of you!

GCH is my favorite venue to do business with; not only is the entire staff a dream to work with because of the team spirit & kindness, I just love the atmosphere. I feel like I'm in another world in Europe, especially w/ the amazing dishes they serve. I've been here as part of networking groups/ guest at weddings & parties & also as the floral designer working for clients weddings & parties. The whole gamut & I always leave with a very satisfied heart. Oh- I've also delivered flowers to the room of the brides & just love the room decor! What an awesome hotel in the heart of Palo Alto!!!
