From oversized chandeliers that surpass your wildest glam wedding dreams, to a charming country ranch in the desert, Las Vegas offers wow-worthy backdrops that you won’t find anywhere else.

## See why we’re obsessed with these epic Las Vegas wedding backdrops.

### The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas

For a wedding venue that combines unconventional luxury with fabulous entertainment, food and all the amenities you could ever want, head to [The Cosmopolitan](https://www.cosmopolitanlasvegas.com/weddings). This stylish resort not only offers a range of photo-worthy options for your wedding day, but will create a memorable experience for you and your guests. The Cosmopolitan’s seasoned event staff will assist you in planning the wedding you’ve always dreamed of, from choosing the best location to hosting an amazing reception. One of The Cosmopolitan’s most unique wedding venues, The Chelsea, is a former industrial factory turned theater that offers 4,000 square feet of customizable event space. For views of the Strip, get married at Point Loma or in one of the breathtaking Chelsea Penthouses. And for the real OMG moment, host a cocktail reception in the stunning two-story Chandelier Lounge — or at least stop by for a photo op!

### The Palazzo

If you’ve ever dreamed of having a romantic, European-inspired wedding, [The Palazzo](https://www.palazzo.com/celebrate/weddings.html) is our top Las Vegas venue choice for you. Adjacent to The Venetian, this elegant venue on the Strip has a wedding chapel, several gardens, terraces, and private banquet rooms for your big day. At the Atrium of the Grand Canal Shoppes, you can get married with The Palazzo Waterfall as your backdrop. The waterfall is decorated seasonally, ensuring that your wedding photos are beautiful and one-of-a-kind. For weddings with less than 20 guests, you can exchange your vows on the Bridge of Love overlooking the Grand Canal and replica of Venice’s famous St. Mark’s Square.

### Luxor Resort & Casino

With traditional and unexpected wedding venues on site, [Luxor](https://www.luxor.com/en/meetings-groups/weddings.html) offers epic backdrops for every type of couple. If you’re going for classic-with-a-twist, the Luxor Garden is surrounded by statement-making views. Your guests will be blown away once they step into the garden, which accommodates up to 40 people and is side-by-side with the Strip’s iconic pyramid and sphinx. You won’t be disappointed by the indoor venue options at Luxor, either. A traditional chapel, a banquet room with modern decor, and a replica of the Titanic staircase are all available as wedding backdrops. Complete your day with one of Luxor’s wedding packages, which range from basic elopements to grand celebrations and include add-ons such as floral design, catering, photography, and event coordination.

### Fremont Street Experience

The [Fremont Street Experience](https://vegasexperience.com/) is a historic Las Vegas attraction, making it a great choice for couples who want the ultimate Las Vegas wedding backdrop. This four-block area along the Strip is lined with shops and light displays beneath a 90-foot tall canopy, giving you plenty of opportunities for ceremony and wedding photos. Fremont Street provides dozens of excellent backdrops, and the colorful neon signs represent the spirit of classic Las Vegas, including some of the city’s most iconic landmarks.Your Fremont Street Experience wedding package includes a hand-tied bouquet, boutonniere, officiant, and wedding photos. 

### Bellagio Las Vegas

In Las Vegas, there are few things more impressive than the Fountains of Bellagio, and this venue gives you an up-close-and-personal view of the famous attraction. At the [Hyde Bellagio](https://www.bellagio.com/en/meetings-groups/weddings.html), you’ll have private use of an outdoor terrace overlooking the fountains — time your “I Do’s” to align with a fountain show for a truly magical moment. You can also get married on a waterfront terrace or in the Bellagio Fountain Courtyard, which has a view of the Eiffel Tower in the distance.

### New York-New York Hotel & Casino

This urban chic venue offers a little slice of “The Big Apple” in Las Vegas. While getting married on the actual Brooklyn Bridge might be out of the question for you, it’s totally doable at [New York-New York](https://www.mgmresorts.com/en/groups-and-weddings/new-york-new-york/weddings.html). The hotel has its own life-size replica of the famous NYC bridge, which is available for private rentals (that means no tourists walking through your wedding photos!). New York-New York is a Manhattanite’s paradise — the hotel also has a replica of the Statue of Liberty, a Greenwich Village area complete with sidewalk cafés and boutique storefronts, and various New York-style pubs. For an especially memorable wedding, your ceremony can take place right before a performance of the hotel’s Cirque du Soleil show. A performer from Zumanity by Cirque du Soleil will officiate your wedding in the Zumanity Theater before leading you to VIP seats to watch the acrobatic show.

### 

### Wynn Las Vegas

Hello, opulent and dramatic spaces! The [Wynn Las Vegas](http://www.wynnlasvegas.com/MeetingsAndWeddings/Weddings) is our number one recommendation if you’re searching for a venue with plenty of character and grandeur. Whether you want a garden wedding or prefer a ballroom backdrop, you’ll find it at this resort. The Wedding Salons at Wynn Las Vegas features timeless, neutral decor and chandeliers, while a swanky poolside cabana would be perfect for an informal outdoor ceremony. There is also a [romantic courtyard venue](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/las-vegas-wedding-venues-to-wow-your-guests), a boldly colored ballroom with floor-to-ceiling windows, an upbeat nightclub venue, and a Moroccan-style foyer aptly named “Tranquility Hall.”
