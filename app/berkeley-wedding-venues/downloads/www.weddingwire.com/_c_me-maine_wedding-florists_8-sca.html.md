I am one of those mothers-of-the-bride who knows nothing about putting on a beautiful wedding. Thank goodness we came to Jennifer. Her knowledge is boundless, and her kindness put me immediately at ease. So professional! Such a lovely personality! She listened carefully, asked many insightful questions, and then came up with a proposal that needed very little adjusting. She stayed within our budget, yet added so many extra touches that put the whole experience way over the top. Just the color and the creativity.....breathless beauty.....her work totally made the wedding. One example -- she spent over two hours wiring flowers to a wagon wheel hanging from the venue's ceiling (a barn) which totally set the tone with such beauty. What a centerpiece statement for our guests as they entered! If you have the chance to use Copper Penny Flowers, grab it. Jennifer is the real deal in every respect.

We are from NH, getting married in Maine. Being gardeners ourselves, I was absolutely stunned on how this company operates. Unlike many companies, this privately owned family oriented company grows flowers in a more natural way. We forget that the earth is like a chain, and if we destroy that chain, we get less of everything. This farm grows their GORGEOUS UNFLAWED flowers without pesticides. Using organic and original methods of growing natural flowers. I had a special color palette, and they took my pallet and went over and beyond any dream I had. Beyond kind and sincerely thoughtful. Can’t express enough about them! I garden, I am a major critic. This company is so wonderful, so let’s treat them with the same kindness they show us! Highly highly recommend, and would hire again a million times over. Married May 31, 2025

As the Mother of the Bride, I helped my daughter through the maze of interviewing and hiring numerous vendors. The venue she chose was a barn in Maine, that was rustic and needed a lot of decor to create the ambience we were hoping for. To keep the cost within our budget we wanted to DIY some decorations like floating candles, votives. Laurie was open and attentive to this, and listened to what was important and priorities for us relating to flowers. Laurie helped my daughter to develop her vision, such as including gauze table runners, and aisle decorations that were EXACTLY what my daughter was looking for but had a hard time expressing what she wanted. She was VERY congenial, easy to work with and delivered absolutely stunning, gorgeous arrangements, bouquets and arbor decorations. AND she was patient with a few changes we made as we were finalizing the contract. Thank you Laurie and team for all of your hard work and talents, to make the ceremony and reception truly magnificent!! **PHOTOS by JAMIE DESI MEDIA**

We chose C.M. Skerritt Designs for our wedding florals, and it was truly the BEST decision we could have made. The flowers were an absolute moment — breathtaking in every way. Chris was incredible to work with from start to finish. I went back and forth in the beginning about what I wanted, but he patiently helped me clarify my vision with thoughtful suggestions and expert advice. From our first conversation, he took the time to understand exactly what I was hoping for, and the final result exceeded every expectation. His work showcased his remarkable attention to detail, seamlessly woven into a stunning overall design. The way our tablescapes flowed, accented with candles, created such a beautiful and romantic atmosphere. Lilacs can be a finicky flower, but he brought my dream arrangements to life so gracefully. Beyond his talent, Chris was simply a joy to work with — his passion for what he does shines through and makes the entire experience even more special.

I can not recommend Chevaughn and her team enough. From the first call, to mood boards, design mock-ups and day of execution, Chevaughn truly makes your design dreams come true. I could not imagine a more perfect wedding day and it is so clear how much Chevaughn cares for her clients and bringing their vision to life. If you are looking for floral design, you will not find someone who is as passionate or has the eye for it like Chevaughn Marie Designs. Highly recommended!

After two family weddings where Brianne, the owner of Stem and Vine, worked her magic, I felt it was time to share my experience. First, I want to say I am so impressed by how Brianne and her team consistently create stunning floral arrangements and event aesthetics, all while maintaining a positive attitude, even during stressful moments. I first worked with Stem and Vine for my daughter’s wedding in Kennebunkport in 2018. Living in California while the bride was in New York City, I was anxious about planning. However, Brianne quickly put me at ease during our first meeting. She listened carefully, shared her work, and showed a clear understanding of our vision. Her expertise in florals and her ability to combine unique elements made me confident in her abilities. My daughter adored Brianne, and together they selected tablecloths, candles, and flowers, including some from her mother’s garden. The wedding was breathtaking, and the florals and elegant touches added by Brianne left a lasting impression on our friends. When last year in 2024 we planned another wedding, I immediately thought of Stem and Vine. This time the California venue had strict setup windows and a preferred vendor list, but Brianne flew in from Maine early to help with the welcome party, the wedding cocktail hour, and additional design areas. Having Brianne help saved my life. Thinking of her flying 6 hours and jumping into the wedding work with such ease brings tears. Brianne has become family to us, we love ordering from her and visiting her shop in downtown Biddeford, a fantastic place for gifts, and floral workshops that are enjoyable and informative. I wholeheartedly recommend Stem and Vine!

We worked with Erin at Skillins and she helped us come up with the bouquets and table arrangements of our dreams! She was incredibly helpful and responsive and completely realized our vision. We have gotten SO many complements on the bouquets, they were absolutely gorgeous. We opted for living planters for the tables with bud vases for pops of color. Some of our friends took the table plants for home and we kept a couple that are still thriving! Plus the prices were so reasonable. We absolutely loved working with Skillins and would recommend them to anyone for any occasion (or just to peruse their plant selection!)

Shelley was absolutely wonderful to work with! On our initial phone call she spent a generous amount of time with me working through all the details, discussing many different options, and creating a vision with me that reflected my budget. Everything we discussed on our call was formally written up within a few hours for my fiancé and I to review. Changes were very flexible throughout the whole process and she even followed up with us a month before our big day to re-confirm the details. She also offered a preview of everything the day before the wedding to ensure that each piece was exactly what we had envisioned. Additionally, the bouquets as well as the florals she did for our arbor were all designed to be able to be repurposed throughout the evening to be used as centerpieces and other decor. Overall we had an amazing experience with Shelley and would highly recommend her to others seeking a very professional and experienced florist!

The Flower Spot truly went above and beyond for a late wedding request. I had a family friend agree to do flowers, but the drought in Maine got the best of her garden. I emailed around one month to my wedding and then got this recommendation by our wedding coordinator, Dirigo Events. They were very responsive and a great price. I sent them a picture to give them a reference for flowers. They went WAY ABOVE and beyond what we were expecting. When I called to pay for the flowers I had a great conversation with the woman on the phone. The owner arrived early the day of the wedding to set up our flowers and we were able to see them way before people arrived. They even had some extra flowers for us, which truly made us feel extra special. I would give them a 10 out of 5 stars if I could. Thank you for treating us with the best service! This is one of the reasons we chose Main for our wedding, because Mainers are just the kindest people! Photography by our incredible photographer @jpaige.photography
