Stunning Views To Remember

The views of this church are stunning. Christina was an amazing church coordinator! She helped us tremendously throughout our wedding rehearsal and ceremony. Even with the rain pouring an hour before the ceremony, it went beautifully. Our guests are still raving about how perfect our wedding ceremony was. It was a wedding to remember.

Hidden Gem For Breathtaking Views Perched A Top Tiburon

Stunning location for an intimate & unique outdoor wedding ceremony. Incredible value. 180 degree & unobstructed view of Richardson Bay and the golden gate bridge from the top of Tiburon. Easy parking for guests- location is not even known by locals. Weather may be a little overcast and unpredictable but we were blessed with perfect weather in May. Our ceremony was on a Saturday morning - and both the bride and groom managed to get sunburnt! Christine was attentive and easy to work with. Thank you!

Great views and helpful staff!

I was present for an intimate vow renewal (40years) and the location did not disappoint! Beautiful facilities with a grounded and inviting landscape.
