You can tell Apple Creek Flowers loves what they do! Even though I grew up around the ladies in the shop, it was truly amazing seeing them in action when it was my turn to experience my wedding day. Every single person on the team will go above and beyond as if you were their family. If you want your space to feel like you on your wedding day, they will make that vision come to life. Lexee my day of coordinator will allow you to feel like a guest on your day, I got to enjoy every minute with her help. What I have learned from them is that flowers are not just flowers…it showcases a beautiful fleeting moment in time that will forever be engraved in my memory. Don’t ever regret getting the flowers…it’s so worth it!

I HIGHLY recommend Trudy’s Flowers! I didn’t have a clear vision of what I was looking for in flowers, and Jocelyn really helped to fine tune and develop the vision/idea that I was thinking of. I was STUNNED by the flowers when they arrived the morning-of, they were a million times more beautiful that I could have imagined. Thank you Jocelyn!!!

I worked with Mark and Pam from Kloeckner Preferred Flowers for my wedding, and they did phenomenal work. I was coming in from out of town for my wedding so we did everything remotely by phone and email-- they were kind, responsive, efficient through the whole process, and made my vision a reality. The ceremony backdrop, centerpieces, and my bouquet were all gorgeous, the colors and floral designs were just as we discussed, and I couldn't have been happier.

Denise and team at Walden Flowers blew my expectations away with my bouquets - they were absolutely stunning! During our first meeting I came in with my inspiration photos and she took them and ran with it. She immediately understood exactly what I was looking for and starting arranging things right there on the spot to provide just a quick glimpse of what is possible. Would highly recommend Walden Flowers for any event!

We worked with Cassandra for our June 2022 wedding, and I am so glad we did! She was so kind and easy to work with. She made the whole process so easy. She listened to all our requests, and helped fill in the gaps with amazing suggestions when we weren’t totally sure what we wanted. She really brought our vision to life, and our day was more beautiful than I could have imagined!

We couldn’t be happier with the floral arrangements for our wedding! From the very first consultation, Kim understood our vision perfectly and brought it to life in the most stunning way. Every bouquet and floral accent was absolutely breathtaking — fresh, vibrant, and thoughtfully designed. The flowers completely transformed our venue and tied every detail together beautifully. Kim was professional, creative, and such a joy to work with throughout the entire process. We received endless compliments from our guests, and we truly couldn’t have imagined our day without her incredible work. Highly recommend An English Garden Wedding & Event Floral to anyone looking for a talented and reliable florist who genuinely cares about making your day unforgettable! 🌿💐

Heritage House of Flowers (Rich, Kathy and Brenda) did AMAZINGLY on the flowers for my wedding shower and wedding. I am not familiar with flower types and only knew I wanted to keep my flowers simple, wild flower-like, giving them only a few examples of flowers I loved and hated. And they blew me away! The flowers were incredible, beautiful and smelled amazing. I got compliments at both events on how beautiful the flowers were and I wish I could have kept them forever. They also helped bring to life a few unique planter/flower pots for the centerpieces for the ceremony and they were amazing. They arrived early and set up just as I had imagined! I couldn't have picked something so beautiful! Thank you all for your masterpieces! I will certainly use you for EVERY event or non-event going forward. Thank you!

Absolutely lovely florists with what felt like full service! We originally set up a meeting to discuss what kind of floral arrangements we needed and what colors we wanted. They had TONS of photos to look through to help give us an idea of what they could do. We placed our order and didn't need to think about it any further - they brought all the flowers to our venue, set up the arch decor, and even CAME BACK to remove arch decor to place on our head table. They provided extra petals and tiny arrangements for a little extra oomph on our entryway tables and cake! We received so many compliments on my bridal bouquet, the bridesmaids bouquets, the boutonnieres, and table decor which was such a huge relief! Our photos of them turned out so magical too!

My experience with Jamie and Town & Country Gardens was everything I could have hoped for - and then some. Jamie truly understood the vision and inspiration I had for the color palette, and the way the floral arrangements and bouquets not only matched but also enhanced the color scheme was incredible. Town & Country Gardens was so easy to work with throughout the entire planning process, and it was an amazing feeling to leave everything in their hands on wedding day. I could not recommend Town & Country Gardens more!!!
