Our wedding at the SC Aquarium was just beautiful! Even though we planned to have our ceremony on the terrace, the weather decided otherwise. The ceremony was instead switched to the Great Ocean Tank Room image and the massive tank served as our backdrop vs the bridge. That was no problem because it worked out perfectly. Sarah Noble and her staff were great! They worked seamlessly with our other vendors.. Family and friends are still raving about what a great venue it was and how elegant, fun and unique the Aquarium was for our wedding. If you love a unique venue that does not require a great deal of decorating, is easy to work with and is absolutely beautiful in every way…choose SC Aquarium. Oh, and I highly recommend going with the additional 1hr…the photo booth was a hit and the rehearsal time gave off the opportunity to prepare in case of wedding day rain…this was a big help since it did rain on our wedding day.

Kim at the Kaminski House Museum was so great to work with!! She was very responsive with any questions we had, and was willing to send pictures of things we had questions about since we were out of town. She was always flexible with meeting us to go over the grounds at the venue and made the process so easy! The Kaminski House Museum is so well taken care of and absolutely gorgeous! Our guests were so amazed of it's views and how well kept the grounds were. Thank you for everything Kim, and thank you for helping make our day PERFECT!!!

I loved having our wedding and reception at the Upcountry History Museum. The front staircase is beautiful and the rest of the museum has plenty of room for guests. They also provided their own rental tables, which saved us some money along with their already reasonable cost. Kimberly was very responsive to any questions. The only things to consider would be that not all guests will fit in one room to eat during the reception, not an issue for us but might be for some. Also you can't start set up until 4. That worked well for us too since we were doing everything in the evening, but might sway some future brides. Such a fun venue!

We had our ceremony upstairs and reception outside, it rained on our day and they were happy to change all our plans and allow us to take pictures in the museum. Katie was amazing to work with. You have to book the tent and heaters through Skyline if you use the Gibbes and we were not happy with them, but the Gibbes itself was everything we wanted. Strongly recommended!!!

Despite living on Hilton Head for almost 20 years, my husband isn’t a beach guy, so when we were looking for venues I wanted to find a location that captured the beauty of Hilton Head but wasn’t too beachy. We were a “Covid couple” and had to rebook our wedding two times before we were finally able to celebrate with family and friends in April of 2022. Robin was amazing to work with, with all of the planning leading up to, and including the day of on the day of, she even recommended our wedding planner that we ended up using- Trish Beck. The venue is so beautiful and captures all of the gorgeous elements of Hilton Head that we wanted to capture. After our postponements, with over two years in the making, the big day was everything we hoped it would be- everything came together as we had hoped and it was such a beautiful day.

Chapman Cultural Center is a venue in Spartanburg, SC for mainly theatrical productions and classes within the arts. My husband and I were fortunate enough to have our wedding reception within the main lobby and entrance area of the beautiful main building. Kathy Campbell was our contact, and she was amazing! Kathy was quick to respond via email or phone. She gave us her cell phone numbers incase we had any questions while she was out of the office. She allowed my family and I to visit the venue as many times as we wished to see how we wanted to decorate, show us all of the tables and chairs that were included, and answer any questions we had at that moment. The Chapman Cultural Center has many beautiful locations for pictures. My bridesmaids, family, and I were actually able to use the awesome, roomy dressing rooms to get ready for our big day! There were make-up mirrors around the entire room, and all TEN of my bridesmaids, hairdressers, and several other family members were able to comfortably enjoy getting ready altogether for the event! My husband and I wanted to exit out of the main entrance to leave for the night with our guests holding sparklers. Kathy made sure to have a police officer stand behind our car in the road so we could take our time telling our family members goodbye before we left for the honeymoon. Kathy thought of everything. The Chapman Cultural Center is filled with classy, laid-back, genuine employees who simply go above and beyond to make their customers happy. We could not have asked for a better experience! We HIGHLY recommend the Chapman Cultural Center for your next event!
