The wedding turned out so much better than I dreamed of it. I am very happy and proud to recommend to anyone who need a stress free wedding planning — use Bee Vang at plant work and floral designs. Thank you, Bee for making my son’s wedding a memorable and good experience to remember. My husband and I appreciated your awesome work.

Best floral design ever

Planning a wedding is a very stressful event, especially if it was going to be out of state. I had contacted Plants Works & Floral Design. I spoke to her about my wedding vision, the color theme and what I would like to have at my wedding. She heard the frustration and stress in my voice; she told me not to worry about it and that she will take care of it. The morning of my wedding day, I walked into the reception hall and I cried with joy and happiness. It was more than I could have imagine, she did such a great job. She made my vision came true. It turned out beautiful. I wish I could have taken all of the floral arrangement home with me. If you ever need a floral designer, I highly recommend Plants Work & Floral design. She will go above and beyond to make your wedding a beautiful one. You will not be disappointed. I love her works and design.

A Magical Experience 

My wedding flowers were a breathtaking reflection of me—vibrant rose in soft blush and creamy whites, interwoven with vine and sprigs of eucalyptus that seemed to capture my warmth and elegance. Each bouquet felt like a love letter, perfectly tying into the joy of the day and making every moment at the altar and reception feel magical. The florist was an absolute dream, taking my vision to heart with such care and ease. They listened to every detail, offered gentle suggestions that felt so me, and handled everything with a calm professionalism that left me free to soak in the love and celebration.

Great experience, highly recommend

Plant Works & Floral Designz was the florist for our wedding. Bee was easy to work with and gave us so many ideas. She listened to what we were looking for and narrowed down a list of ideas, which helped make the overwhelming process so much easier. I trusted her completely, and with all of the other wedding planning we had going on, I trusted her completely, and the result was amazing. Bee made the bride's and bridesmaids' bouquets to the centerpieces, and everything in between was all perfect and fit our theme and color scheme perfectly. I would recommend Plant Works & Floral Designz and will use them for all my floral arrangement needs in the future.

Highly recommend! 

Bee was our wedding florist and my husband and I couldn’t have asked for a better florist! She was great at bringing our ideas to life. Easy to communicate with and very professional. She is passionate and loves what she does and it shows in her work! If you’re in need of a florist who loves what she does then Bee is the right person!
