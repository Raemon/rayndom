5.0 out of 5 rating

Golden Scrolls is absolutely incredible. We had a micro wedding at a castle and our wonderful violinist and cellist duo made the whole evening (music for the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception) feel elegant and enchanted. In addition to their broad song selection (and willingness to learn two additional songs special to us), they arrived perfectly on time, were wonderfully professional, and played beautifully. We especially enjoyed working with Kevin from start to finish because of his attention to detail and terrific service. Golden Scrolls was truly *instrumental* in making our big day as special and memorable as it was. We’d highly recommend them!

Matt is absolutely a professional at what he does! We reached out to him relatively close to our wedding date because our original pianist couldn't play during the Mass, and that was the best happy accident we could have! He was very quick to respond and willing to play with some other violinists we hired for the Mass, and he joined with them seamlessly. His professionalism will leave you stress free and your ears happy!

Andrea and her group were so, so wonderful to work with! We hired them to perform as a duo (cello and harp) at the church for our wedding service, then as a trio (violin, cello, viola) at our cocktail reception at another location after. Throughout, Andrea was super accommodating, communicative, and seamless with logistics, playlists, and arrangements and delivered a top-quality tone and professional sound which was so well received. My only regret is that as the groom I was not able to simply sit and listen and enjoy! Pizzazz has a wide variety of songs and genres in their expansive catalog to choose from, and they were so pleasant to meet in person and were genuinely happy to be there. With so many moving pieces in organizing a wedding, hiring Pizzazz was a major relief in all aspects and let us focus on other areas knowing our string music was superb. Thank you!

This group was fantastic - Ben Dean, a violinist in the group, coordinates these engagements and called me several times just to check in. His group knew a relatively uncommon piece we wanted for the processional and they did a great job. This was the only vendor to follow up with a survey post-wedding.

Kate is wonderful! She was perfect for our cocktail hour. She played outside in the heat, our guests loved her and it was a perfect touch to add. Highly recommend Kate to any brides. She will definitely not cause you any unneeded drama or headaches. She is on time and was wonderful to work with.

I kept putting off determining our ceremony structure and music hoping that the perfect ideas, songs readings, etc. would come to me in due time (silly, I know). I had originally planned to use our DJ/Band for our ceremony music, however at the insistence of my parents (who wanted a string quartet) I agreed to doing some live music instead. As we were having a more relaxed outdoor summer wedding, I wanted something that was elegant, contemporary and upbeat for purposes of the ceremony but not stuffy, too classical or cliche (ie wedding march, canon in D, etc.). A single guitarist sounded like a good fit. My wedding planner suggested Scott and I'm so glad she did. After reviewing his song list I was excited about the possibility of using some fun, modern stuff for our ceremony. When I saw the Beatles' "All you Need Is Love" on his suggested recessional playlist I was sold. We ended up using "I Will" for the walk-down song. My Dad and I were a little worried about it sounding too fast but after finding a couple of examples of other classical guitarists playing the song on youtube, I was able to give Scott some guidance as to tempo. He was more than happy to oblige and the song turned out exactly as I had hoped. Guests all had very complimentary things to say about the music he played during the seating time too. We simply asked that he stick to mostly modern, upbeat stuff for that as well (jazz tunes, girl from ipanema, etc.) and he accomodated. In short, Scott set the tone for the rest of the wedding and did an excellent job. In general Scott was friendly, really easy to work with, and very responsive. This was great especially considering that we only hired him with less than a month to go! Thanks Scott!

Amanda is a talented harpist who played at our indoor ceremony. She was mistake-free and very expressive in her playing. She was able to time the music perfectly so that there were no times of too much or too little music. All of our guests loved the sound of the harp, and she was able to fill the space with her sound easily. She met with us weeks before the ceremony, and was able to give us a sample of several different pieces to help our selection process. She was very professional and arrived very early to set up. An excellent choice for your ceremony!

Elizabeth played the flute accompanied by an organist at my daughters wedding ceremony. She did an excellent job, choose beautiful pieces, and was very reliable. I would recommend her highly for anyone thinking of having a flutist at their ceremony.

We wanted Spanish guitar at our wedding since we were married at Spain restaurant. Lorena is one of the only musicians around that plays at these types of events. Her music was wonderful!

Tim was absolutely one of the highlights of our wedding! We received many compliments on his playing and song selection but his inspired rendition of Tequila (which he composed just for us) was truly unforgetable and totally WOWed our crowd. Choosing Tim to perform at our wedding was one of the best decisions we made.
