Wow, the wedding reception was spectacular and our wedding coordinator, Victoria Hansen from Black Tie entertainment exceeded every single one of our expectations!!! We loved how calm, professional and extremely helpful she was from the beginning to the end of the reception. We did not have to worry about one thing the entire time. Every detail was meticulously attended to. Her professionalism, kindness and joyful nature made our experience perfect. Honestly, Victoria made our wedding a complete success. With her direction behind the scenes, every detail, and every moment was outstanding. We could not possibly have been happier!

Kevin was amazing, he played everything we had requested and made sure to not play our do not play songs. He kept the mood bright through dinner and kept people on the dance floor afterwards. Really strong song mixing and overall superb job!

Truly just a perfect night. Gwin entertainment was on point for everything. We had a complicated ceremony and he didn’t miss a beat. And the dancing after was exactly what I was looking for. He played everything I requested and really set the mood the way my wife and I wanted. We had gone to a few weddings before ours where the dj’s weren’t super amazing but Gwin entertainment was perfect and better than we could’ve asked for. I highly recommend him for any event!

Truly a wonderful DJ, extremely professional and expert in what he does. Would recommend him to everybody!!! Please book him for your event to have a stress-free event and a lot of fun!

From the moment we first contacted Music, Music, and More Music, we knew we were in good hands. They made the entire planning process seamless and stress-free. Christian was great communicating and requesting the necessary info from us. DJ Craig Whitacre executed our requests PERFECTLY! We wanted a classy music selection with a few dance songs mixed in. We weren’t very specific on songs we wanted played and he understood what we were looking for and played great music! Craig also did a perfect job with announcements and staying on schedule with our timeline. Thank you Craig for a being a big part of why our wedding was so fabulous!

Alex was wonderful to work with. He scheduled an informational call with me as soon as I reached out, and I got great vibes from him right off the bat. We had another call about a month before my event where we went through all of my song selections, timeline and a few special requests I had for him. He was super accommodating - even when he learned he’d need to completely move his set up between the ceremony and the reception. Without missing a beat, he said he could do it and offered to bring on his business partner, Michael, to help him for the first part of the evening so the move would be quick. Alex and Michael arrived right on time, got set up quickly, hit their song cues perfectly during the ceremony and then got re-set up before anyone even noticed there was a break in the music. It was clear that they are both true professionals. After the ceremony, Alex transitioned seamlessly into the role of emcee for our entrance, dances, cake cutting and toasts, and then back to DJ to get the dance floor going after the formalities wrapped. Alex had a great read on our guests’ energy and played a great mix of music to appeal to every age group in the crowd. I’m pretty sure every single guest was on the dance floor at some point the night - even my 91-year-old grandmother couldn’t resist dancing to Sweet Caroline. Throw some Lizzo and Britney Spears into the mix and we had ourselves a party! Alex is really fantastic at what he does, not to mention very fairly priced. I’d highly recommend his services to any couple!

Dwight dj'd our July wedding at Keswick Vineyards and he was the BEST! Dwight worked with us for over a year, checked in constantly to make sure we had what we needed, and encouraged us to give as little or as much guidance as we wanted when it came to the music we wanted at our wedding. He played every song we asked him to, understood our music tastes so he could build songs into the set that made sense for us, and kept things moving throughout the reception at the perfect pace. He's the best of the best, and I really trusted him with our day even before the wedding -- after the wedding, I can't recommend him enough! He was also a really warm presence and comfort throughout the day, kept reminding us the day was about us, and made our last private dance really special. You can't go wrong with Dwight!

Scott answered my email and questions from the very beginning. He was already set up for the reception when we arrived and he was great with the music selection and lights.

Organizing everything leading up to our big day was so so easy, and Danny absolutely nailed our vibe! I sent him a 12 hour long playlist that took years for me to curate, and he handpicked the absolute best songs for every single moment of the night in no time. Also, when I decided to changed the order of dinner and dancing, Danny went above and beyond to make it easy and breezy for us!! Absolutely cannot recommend Danny enough and Astro is a rockstar company!!!!
