Shopping for a dress as the mother of the groom is notoriously a difficult task—but what about a grandmother-of-the-groom dress? If you're attending your grandson's wedding, you deserve an outfit that's just as wow-worthy as the moms, [grandmother of the bride](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/grandmother-of-bride-dress), and the rest of the wedding party. We've hand-picked some of the best grandmother-of-the-groom dresses available to buy online, so you (or the grandma you're shopping for) can focus on celebrating this special occasion, not stressing about what to wear.

Whether you're a glam grandma or your style leans more traditional, we promise this list will give you plenty of options to shop. 

## 

## Beaded Chiffon Gown

Perfect for the warmer seasons, this floor-length gown has illusion flutter sleeves for a dramatic touch. The shimmering hand beadwork is paired with a blouson fit for an ultra-flattering and ethereal look.

## 

## Pink Eyelet Lace Shirtdress

For the grandmothers out there who appreciate proper etiquette and table manners, this timeless dress might be just your style. The shirtdress has a laser-cut eyelet lace design and a modest tea length, with a belted waist that ties in an oversized bow. 

**Rickie Freeman for Teri Jon** taffeta shirtdress with eyelet skirt, $595, [Teri Jon](https://www.neimanmarcus.com/p/rickie-freeman-for-teri-jon-taffeta-shirt-dress-w-eyelet-skirt-prod230620318)

## 

## Black Sequin Gown

The glam grandmas are going to want to see this long-sleeve evening gown. The allover sequins, midnight hue, and form-fitting silhouette make this a stunning grandmother of the groom dress if you're going for a dazzling, glitzy look. 

**Adrianna Papell** floral beaded dress with sheer long sleeves, $349, [Adrianna Papell](https://www.adriannapapell.com/collections/sequin-dresses/products/floral-beaded-dress-with-sheer-long-sleeves-in-midnight-ap1e205390)

## 

## Blue Pantsuit

[Jumpsuits](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-guest-jumpsuit) are a popular alternative to classic wedding guest dresses. And while that might sound too trendy for the grandmother of the groom at first, we think even the most traditional of grandmothers will approve of this modest three-piece look. The solid straight pant legs paired with the sequin top and matching jacket is a comfortable yet stylish ensemble. 

**R &M Richards **3-piece sequin top, jacket, and jersey pants set, $129, [Kohl's](https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-6739534/womens-r-m-richards-3-piece-sequin-top-jacket-and-jersey-pants-set.jsp)

## 

## Two-Piece Evening Gown With Jacket

Here's a perfect option for grandmas who love versatile dresses. This two-piece set comes with a floor-length chiffon gown and matching jacket that you can remove and re-wear after the wedding day. 

**Alex Evenings** embroidered lace mock two-piece gown with jacket, $229, [Nordstrom](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/alex-evenings-embroidered-lace-mock-two-piece-gown-with-jacket/5554083)

## 

## Black Long-Sleeve Velvet Dress

You can't go wrong with a classic black maxi dress. The velvet fabric and full length of this formal dress make it a sophisticated option for [black tie weddings](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/black-tie-wedding-attire), and you can easily re-wear it for other occasions in the future. 

**Donna Karan New York** Social Occasion Jewel black velvet gown, $550, [Saks Fifth Avenue](https://www.saksfifthavenue.com/product/donna-karan-new-york-social-occasion-jewel-back-velvet-gown-0400019729034.html)

## 

## Sequin V-Neck Gown 

Shimmer and sparkle is the name of the game when it comes to this glamorous look. This full-coverage long dress features a blouson bodice to add shape and highlight the waist. The glittering silver color is ideal for a winter wedding.

**Sachin & Babi** Gabby sequin gown, $1,095, [Farfetch](https://www.farfetch.com/shopping/women/sachin-babi-gabby-sequin-gown-item-18848328.aspx)

## 

## Pink and Orange Patterned Dress

Headed to a beach wedding? Try a colorful grandmother of the groom dress, like this crinkle georgette dress with a bright pink and orange print. Pair it with high heels or [flat sandals](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-sandals) for a summery look. 

**Sachin & Babi** Chelsea gown, $285, [Sachin & Babi](https://www.sachinandbabi.com/products/chelsea-gown-pastel-sunset-hydrangea)

## 

## Jumpsuit With Cape

A special occasion doesn't require you to wear a floor-length gown. In fact, a timeless jumpsuit can do the trick. The cape detail adds a fun, trending element to an otherwise formal outfit, and it's available in two other classic colors. 

**Ralph Lauren** belted cape georgette jumpsuit, $295, [Ralph Lauren](https://www.ralphlauren.com/women-clothing-dresses/belted-cape-georgette-jumpsuit/0073996647.html)

## 

## Long-Sleeve Red Dress

This regal dress is adorned with intricate details like allover sequins and soft tulle ruffles along the neckline and shoulders. If the wedding takes place in December, choose the festive red color to complete the holiday vibe. Otherwise, the dress comes in three other colors (ivory, pink, and champagne) and two different lengths. 

**Needle & Thread** Aurelia long sleeve gown, $769, [Needle & Thread](https://us.needleandthread.com/collections/evening-dresses/products/aurelia-long-sleeve-gown-deep-red)

## 

## Knee-Length Jacket Dress

A matching embroidered lace jacket is the focal point of this chiffon dress. The three-quarter sleeves are partially sheer, so you won't overheat while adding coverage for your shoulders and arms. 

**Jessica Howard** soutache jacket and jewel-neck midi dress, $169, [Macy's](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/jessica-howard-womens-soutache-jacket-jewel-neck-midi-dress?ID=17068555)

## 

## Structured Crepe Dress With Cape

A semi-sheer cape overlay takes an otherwise simple grandmother of the groom dress to the next level, without stealing the show from the happy couple.

**Teri Jon by Rickie Freeman** crepe chiffon overlay cape gown, $810, [Saks Fifth Avenue](https://www.saksfifthavenue.com/product/teri-jon-by-rickie-freeman-crepe-chiffon-overlay-cape-gown-0400020344138.html)

## 

## Two-Piece Pantsuit

Dresses and skirts not your thing? For an outfit that gives a bit more flexibility, this wide-leg pantsuit allows you to show off your best dance moves. The jacket and top add the perfect amount of embellishment to the plain black pants.

## 

## Satin and Chiffon Midi Dress

You'll look luminous in this tiered chiffon and charmeuse satin midi dress. The best part about this dress (besides the comfortable flowy silhouette)? A matching jacket adds coverage if you don't want to show your shoulders. 

**Komarov** beaded charmeuse & chiffon tiered dress with jacket, $460, [Nordstrom](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/beaded-charmeuse-chiffon-tiered-dress-with-jacket/5501301)

## 

## Lace Gown and Jacket

Comfort meets style in this two-piece dress made of soft ace. With an A-line silhouette, this gorgeous gown is flattering without being restrictive. Allover lace and a scalloped trim on the jacket give this set a bit of pizzazz. 

**Tadashi Shoji** strapless corded lace gown and jacket set, $1,018, [Nordstrom ](https://www.neimanmarcus.com/p/tadashi-shoji-strapless-corded-lace-gown-and-jacket-set-prod268170030)

## Blush Satin Gown

This floor-length satin gown has a V-neckline and faux wrap bodice for an elegant fit. The pretty light pink color and puff sleeves make this formal dress a perfect choice for a [springtime wedding](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/spring-wedding-guest-dresses). 

**Mac Duggal** draped faux wrap puff long sleeve gown, $298, [Mac Duggal](https://macduggal.com/products/55624)

**Mac Duggal** sheer long sleeve beaded gown, from $798, [Mac Duggal](https://macduggal.com/products/93902)

## 

## Flutter Sleeve Knee-Length Dress

Keep things simple but chic in this knee-length dress accented with statement flutter sleeves. The skirt flares out for a flattering fit, and the lace is woven with sequins to add shimmer for a fancy dress code. 

**Kiyonna** Starry sequined lace cocktail dress, $178, [Nordstrom](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/kiyonna-starry-sequin-lace-fit-flare-cocktail-dress-plus/7577531)

## 

## Off-the-Shoulder Trumpet Gown

Your grandson's wedding is such a special event, so why not dress accordingly? The draping throughout the bodice and beaded appliqué on the back of this gown will have you feeling especially glamorous. We also love this option as a mother of the bride dress or grandmother of the bride dress. 

**La Femme** off the shoulder beaded satin trumpet gown, $599, [Nordstrom](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/la-femme-off-the-shoulder-beaded-satin-trumpet-gown/4797185)

## 

## A-Line Dress With Collar

This bronze-toned dress is polished and sophisticated with its bold portrait collar and pockets. Ruching at the waist flatters your midsection, while the A-line skirt skims over your hips.
