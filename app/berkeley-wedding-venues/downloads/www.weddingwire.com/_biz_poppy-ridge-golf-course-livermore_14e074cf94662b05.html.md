Peaceful, beautiful, and stress-free wedding venue

We could not have picked a better wedding venue than Poppy Ridge. What clinched our decision was how awesome the planning staff are. Isadora and Abby were so easy to get in contact with, answered all of our clarifying questions throughout the process, and made it flexible and easy to send in our final numbers and payments. The all-inclusive price at Poppy Ridge is a fantastic value and made our wedding planning so much easier. Furthermore, the venue is absolutely stunning. The outdoor/indoor vibe, peaceful setting, and clean, classic aesthetic were exactly what we wanted. The jaw-dropping sunset happened perfectly during our first dance and was an added bonus that had all of our guests taking photos. Furthermore, the venue provided ample food and alcohol to supply our guest count of 150 people. Poppy Ridge was our dream wedding!

Poppy Ridge Oct Wedding

My husband and I had our wedding this past October at Poppy Ridge and it was an amazing experience! Abby and Tiffani were both extremely helpful and communicative. Tiffani went above and beyond on the day of to make sure everything ran smoothly and made us feel extremely supported. The venue is absolutely stunning at this time of year, our guests had an amazing time and the food was delicious! The amount we spent was well worth it and reasonable. We can’t wait to play some rounds of golf and grab a bite of the delicious food again. Please don’t hesitate to call or tour this place for your special day!

Perfect location for a DIY Bride

Got married at Poppy Ridge in April and it was such smooth and wonderful experience thanks to Abby and Tiffani. As we were planning our wedding by ourselves, we greatly appreciated their expertise and recommendations throughout the process. I greatly appreciated how accessible Abby and Tiffani made themselves to us in our final weeks of planning. On the day of, they managed our timeline well and the food was fantastic!  
  
We think Poppy Ridge is a fantastic venue if you’re looking for a flexible space or planning a DIY/local wedding :) we especially loved that there were lots of opportunities to customize the options, they had a lot of wedding pieces included (cutlery, linens, etc) already, and we were able to come in the day before to drop off items for set up.

Holiday Administrative Luncheon

I recently hosted our Holiday Administrative Luncheon at Poppy Ridge Golf Course, and I cannot express enough how exceptional the event staff was! From the moment we arrived, the team was incredibly welcoming and attentive, ensuring that every detail was taken care of.  
  
The venue itself was beautifully decorated for the season, creating a warm and festive atmosphere that set the perfect tone for our gathering. The staff was highly professional, assisting with setup and ensuring that everything ran smoothly throughout the event. They were always available to address any needs or requests, making us feel valued and well-cared for.  
  
The catering was outstanding, with a delicious menu that impressed all our attendees. The presentation was beautiful, and the food was both flavorful and fresh. The staff was efficient in serving, and they handled dietary restrictions with ease, which we greatly appreciated.  
  
Overall, the event staff at Poppy Ridge Golf Course exceeded our expectations and contributed significantly to the success of our luncheon. I highly recommend them for any event, and I look forward to hosting future gatherings at this wonderful venue! We have continued to host our luncheons here because the staff and service is so amazing!  
  
Thank you, Poppy Ridge, for making our holiday celebration so memorable!

Celebrations

I used Poppy Ridge for 2 events this year. They have so many options to make sure that your event can fit their space and the team is so easy to work with. They are quick to respond, always willing to help and are focused on the people at the event. This is somewhere I plan to continue to come when we need an event hosted.

The most Beautiful Venue!

We had our wedding here end of April and we had the best experience! The golf course was bright green, with green rolling hills surrounding the venue. We felt like we were away from the busy-ness of the bay area; the most perfect wedding venue!  
We worked with Isadora and Abby for over a year and they were always very helpful and communicative with even the smallest of questions. We moved states during our planning so they were able to move up our food tastings to accommodate our move and were responsive with continued planning over phone and email.  
The food was FABULOUS and we got feedback from guests all night long that it was the best wedding food they've ever had! They made our custom drinks one by one and exactly how we wanted them! We appreciated the attention to the detail and the ease of having everything all in one spot.  
Would highly recommend!

Absolutely Amazing!

We can not rave enough about poppy ridge! The food was amazing, the venue is so perfect for the rustic romantic wedding we had, and the views are to die for! Abby and Isadora made everything so much easier, and are the absolute best around! They made sure the bar was stocked and that all the guests and especially myself and my new husband were taken care of. They went above and beyond to make our day as special as can be! We already plan to make it a traditional to go to poppy ridge each year for an anniversary lunch😁. Thank y'all so much for everything and I will recommend to anyone looking for even space!

Love Our Wedding Reception Venue!

  
My husband and I are so glad we hosted our wedding reception at Poppy Ridge. The venue was absolutely perfect for our event size. It's neither too big nor too small. The food and cocktail prices were very reasonable. We love the food and our guests commented how delicious the meals were. We got awesome golden hour photos by the venue's vast rolling hills considering it's a golf course. We didn't have to worry about houses being in the background in comparison to other golf course venues we looked at. Thank you Abby, Leanne, and the entire Poppy Ridge staff for helping make our wedding day perfect.

One of my favorite venues to work with. Not only a beautiful facility that lends itself to the amazing out door shots of pre and post ceremony, but a wonderful atmosphere that puts everyone at ease. The staff are wonderful and a treat to work with, very professional and knowledgeable. I have worked with them for many years and I am always pleased to find out I will be shooting there again.
