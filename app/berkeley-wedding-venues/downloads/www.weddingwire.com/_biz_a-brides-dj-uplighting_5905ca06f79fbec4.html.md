Best DJ Ever

Robby was such a phenomenal DJ for our wedding day. From planning to the final song, he was kind, knowledgeable, and just an all around wonderful guy. He was easy to work with, friendly, engaging, and continued to check in with us to see if all was going well with the music on our wedding day. He understood our vision and random taste in music, and even played some of our favorite songs that we didn’t mention- he just had such an understanding of what we liked and wanted for our big day. We’ve had many of our wedding guests tell us how much they enjoyed dancing the night away with DJ Robby at the helm. We couldn’t be happier with any other DJ and I highly recommend A Bride’s DJ if you want a personalized experience and genuine hype DJ for your wedding or any other event! It was spectacular!

So much fun

Robby killed it!! Working with Robby and Diana was effortless from the jump. They brought so much fun energy and made planning so simple. Robby totally captured the energy and vibe we wanted and our guests were dancing all night long. We had so much fun and couldn’t be happier!

I'm a Believer

When I met Robby, I told him right away that I was against having a DJ at my wedding. Though my partner and our planner were telling me it would be helpful for the flow and energy, I wanted a personal, intimate vibe and didn't like the idea of a random guy squawking at my guests all night. I came in very skeptical.  
  
HOWEVER! A Bride's DJ turned me into a believer. In total, my partner and I spent ~4 hours on planning music and emcee wedding things. That's it! Including a really fun date night where my partner and I got to go through Robby's fancy app and pick all of our favorite songs to play throughout the day. And our meeting with A Bride's DJ a week before our wedding was so fun - Robby is quick to laugh and also quickly picked up our vibe, making us feel so comfortable throughout the process. I can't imagine our wedding night without him.  
  
Take it from a skeptic: DIYing your event's sound equipment, playlists, and emceeing sounds simple, but having a professional is absolutely worth the cost. Especially when you get an all-around guy like Robby as your DJ! Book him!

DJ Tony - Homewood Wedding

Tony & the entire A Bride's DJ crew were incredible! They enthusiastically helped create a custom father daughter dance song prior to the wedding to help my family practice. DJ Tony was possibly the best DJ I've heard at a wedding. His transitions were great and he was able to read the crowd. I had so many people tell me they've never seen a wedding dance floor so crowded all night. I really didn't want the night to end. He responded well to our requests to songs and politely declined when people requested songs on our do not play list. I would emphatically recommend DJ Tony and A Bride's DJ to anyone. We still talk about how great he was.

An unforgettable wedding experience

Tony is easily the best wedding DJ we’ve ever seen. He was thoughtful, detail-oriented and intuitively understood what we wanted. He adapted on the fly to what our guests liked, which kept them out on the floor dancing from the first song to the very end. Guests couldn’t stop raving about how much they loved the song choices and clean transitions. We also did a first song instead of a first dance, and Tony was super easy to work with as we figured out what we needed.   
  
Everyone from A Bride’s DJ was super easy to work with during the planning phase. They understood exactly what kind of vibes we wanted, and did a great job of accounting for all the details we would have missed. Tony and A Bride’s DJ were a huge part of why our wedding was a huge success!

truly… an above & beyond experience 

Every part of this process was fun & easy. It was so nice to have this aspect of planning the wedding go so smoothly & stress free, & that was all because of A Brides DJ! We even gave some super last minute requests & they delivered above & beyond. Would recommend a million times!

A Bride's DJ exceeded our expectations!

A Bride's DJ - North Carolina was an amazing choice for our wedding. From the first call, their communication style was easy, organized, and energetic. They brought incredible energy and fun to the dance floor all night long, and their expertise helped bring our vision for the perfect wedding celebration to life. The DJ had fantastic ideas that kept our guests engaged and dancing all evening. We couldn't have asked for a better team to make our special day so memorable!

Just hire them, you won't regret it!

We had our wedding ceremony and reception at The Hideaway in May 2024 with A Bride’s DJ as our DJ and master of ceremony, and they were phenomenal.   
  
The entire process was seamless. They are such a well-oiled machine that we truly felt zero stress because we knew we were in good hands. We’ve been to a lot of weddings, and even though we may be a little biased, A Bride’s DJ was by far the best.  
  
Diana was professional, responsive, and easy to work with for pricing and scheduling. Robby was our DJ and master of ceremony. Music is important to us, and Robby listened to our likes/dislikes, and was able to balance a pretty extensive list of songs we liked with his own choices, making for an awesome night. During the ceremony, all of the songs were spot on, exactly as we requested, and volume was perfect for the venue. There were no awkward silences and every transition was seamless. As we moved to the reception, he kept the dance floor full and smiles on everyone’s faces and was excellent at reading the room. As the bride, I only left the dance floor once all night! Robby checked in on us multiple times throughout the night, asking if we were OK or needed drinks, which was so kind and unexpected.  
  
There isn’t one single thing we would change from our experience and would highly recommend them for anyone looking for these services!

Amazing Service!

I was very intimidated at the thought of figuring out all of the wedding music, but Diana and Robby made it easy! Their planning website has a ton of helpful information for selecting music and organizing your reception. I am not a huge dancer, so they also provided suggestions for things that we could do besides dancing. We ended up doing bride/groom trivia and it was a huge hit!  
  
Our DJ, Matt, did a wonderful job for both the ceremony and reception music. I wouldn’t change anything about our day!   
  
We also opted to use one of their photo booths and I’m so glad we did. Ours was a smaller wedding (~40 people), but the photo booth was busy all night and the photos are great keepsakes for us and our guests.

If you want a fun wedding you need A Brides DJ

A Bride's DJ is exactly what you need to have a fun wedding. From our first interets call to our wedding day, Diana and Robby were responsive, playful, and dedicated to making our vision come to life. The DJ services were truly catered to our event and it matched our vision perfectly. Robby was able to mix and cute songs so that transitions were flawless. He even took the time to check in with me during the reception to ensure that everything was to my liking and asked if he needed to change anything. He kept all of our guests on the dance floor for over 3 hours. All of our guests were raving about Robby and his music selection. If you want a fun wedding run, don't walk to book a Bride's DJ.

When you book with A Bride's DJ, you can have total confidence that they have the experience and attention to detail to make your wedding great. Robby & Diana are great people to work with too! Since I am a DJ too, I hope you'll consider me too :) , but when I am already booked, they are the first ones that I recommend! Eric Everett
