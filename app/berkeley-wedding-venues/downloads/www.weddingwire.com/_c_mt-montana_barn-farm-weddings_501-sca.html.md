My husband and I were married at this BEAUTIFUL location, and we couldn't have had a better experience. The venue was so well located, close enough to Bigfork for guests to stay overnight at. It also had a gorgeous waterfall that we had our ceremony in front of. As for the reception, there was enough space for over 200 guests to fit comfortably, and the FOOD was absolutely delicious. We received MANY compliments for our reception meal, and we couldn't get enough of it. Bobbi, the event planner for us, was extremely easy to communicate with, and she worked tirelessly to make sure our day was perfect. Any concerns we had, she answered them right away as we prepared our wedding away from Bigfork. The owners are some of the most gracious people we have ever had the opportunity of knowing, and we truly believe you wouldn't be happier with any other place but here. It's true Montana beauty and charm, but also classy and elegant. We will be recommending this place to anyone and everyone!

I got married here in July of 2019, and this venue is as good as it gets! The staff are simply wonderful, down-to-earth, and make you feel valued. The guests loved the scenery, Cindy is absolutely incredible from start to finish, and GRH made our day special. I could not have asked for better service, especially considering reviews I read for other venues. My eight bridesmaids and I also stayed in the treehouses on site, which were fabulous. Clean, comfy, spacious, and wonderful for the day-of or other out-of-town visitors. A++++++++++ times a million. If you're considering Gallatin River Hideaway, just commit and book it!

We absolutely loved our experience with 320. The team was truly incredible, the venue was perfect, and our guests had a wonderful time. Brittany was so responsive and helpful and everyone during our wedding weekend went above and beyond to make it amazing. If you're thinking about getting married at 320, don't wait - DO IT!

My husband and I had our wedding at Rockin' TJ Ranch in July 2024, and we can't recommend it enough! Teresa is the owner and she is on top of everything and very easy to work with! Everything was seamless from all of the planning to the perfect wedding day! Teresa and Melanie, the event coordinator, were incredible with scheduling the tastings, helping us find nearby vendors, and answering all of our questions throughout the process. The in-house catering, Catering Under the Big Sky, served AMAZING food and had a variety of unique options to choose from! Our day of concierge, Maggie, helped us set up all of our tables and made my visions come to life! She was very lovely to work with. Troy with Mach1Music did an epic job as our DJ. He kept the whole day flowing smoothly and knew how to keep the crowd on the dance floor! All of the service was outstanding from the bartender, servers, and clean-up crew. Teresa was present on our wedding day and took care of all of our needs. We had the best day of our lives and we would recommend Rockin' TJ Ranch to any couple looking for a beautiful wedding venue where everything is taken care of for you!

For years, I have been hearing about weddings at the Barn, but nothing I was told could match the incredible experience we had. It started with our amazing host, Darcy. She was friendly, knowledgeable, and eager to help us with everything from recommendations on rentals to caterers. With her help and guidance we were able to create an experience for our daughter and new son in law, that was unlike anything we have ever attended before. The Barn is spacious and our 150 guests comfortably mingled about from the front entry way, to the dance floor, through the beautiful causeway, decorated with sparkling chandeliers, out to the back patio where they could enjoy a drink at the bar while enjoying the breathtaking views. We are so grateful to Darcy and her family for catering to our every need! They gave us the use of their golf cart, they helped us arrange tables, coordinated with our wedding planner, and even took our left over flowers to the retirement home when it was all over! We also took advantage of the rental above the Barn. My daughter and her bridesmaids enjoyed a fun night with just the girls on Friday and it was a great place for the newlyweds on Saturday. Darcy allowed us access to the Barn prior to the wedding so we were able to put drinks in the huge/walk in cooler and set up flower arrangements. She also gave us access to her storage rooms where she houses tables, vases, signage, and more! The folks at The Barn on Finley Point know how to treat people. They are truly kind and generous. Darcy responded quickly to my texts, encouraged us throughout the entire process. We are so grateful for the wonderful experience!

If you are looking for the epitome of the Montana location for your wedding or event, you absolutely must see Big Vista Ranch. With unparalleled sweeping views of the Gallatin Valley and the Bridger and Madison Mountains towards Big Sky as your backdrop, this very special venue has it all and is one of a kind... It's breathtaking in every direction and Mark and Jayne have thoughtfully curated their incredible property to make any event one that is memorable and truly unique. Elk are randomly heard in the distance while mule deer run through the fields beyond the fountains in the lake. Sweeping meadows of undulating grasses make for the most amazing glow hour photos. Flower gardens, water falls, and even a koi fish pond surround the beautiful venue that has attached covered pergolas allowing you to extend your dining and cocktail experience outside. Slate patios lead your guests to either the ceremony site by the lake or inside to sit before the warm glow of the fireplace under the stunning vintage crystal chandelier suspended in the venue while you dine or dance. Warm up around the campfire as the mountains take on their alpenglow and the cool nights commence, and be amazed at the beauty of Montana. It is truly so special here. Big Vista Ranch is truly a gem in the center of it all. They also have a beautiful home/lodge for guests to stay at and have additional lodging options also in the works on site in addition to the lodge. I am an event planner in Bozeman and this is my very favorite venue for all of the reasons above, but also because Mark and Jayne are engaged in making the experience for their couples and clients one that they will never forget. They are incredible people so committed to creating a special place for very special moments. It is a true joy to work with them.

Since getting engaged in Montana, we knew we wanted to do our wedding there. I researched quite a few venues, but only really “looked” at one. I was an out of state bride, so we did a video tour with Heather and I fell in love immediately. We booked it the next day. Our first time seeing the venue in person was the night before the wedding and everything I had pictured for the big day started to come together. I envisioned farm house tables, rustic barn, beautiful scenery, and cream/greens as my floral. This venue is everything you could imagine. The bridal suite was the perfect place for my girls and I to get ready. It had the perfect view of the alter and where guests arrived. The men all loved their time getting ready in the cabin on the property. Heather was our saving grace on the day of and kept us all on schedule and in line. You will not regret choosing Hart Ranch!

Summer Star Ranch was the perfect venue for our perfect day! Starr and Matt are amazing to work with: extremely kind, helpful, and accommodating. The location is great: a beautiful 30min drive out of Helena (close enough for easy access for guests and vendors but far enough to feel like you’ve been transported to a magical mountain getaway), nestled in the Big Belt Mountains, with stunning views for all your photography needs. The barn is beautiful and is equipped with pretty much everything you need (no need to rent tables or chairs) and can be decorated however you like. There are two ceremony spots to choose, both beautiful. There are also a couple of cabins and a glamping tent on the property. We stayed in the glamping tent on our wedding night and we also rented the two cabins for our immediate family and bridal party to get ready in and stay in. There is also a campground down the road that many of our guests camped at. The large horse pastures made for some amazing photos, and since we were married they have also added some highland cows! It did end up raining on our day, but even that couldn’t have ruined the beauty of the ranch, and honestly, the photos turned out amazing. It was the moody magical western wedding day of our dreams and we couldn’t have asked for anything more. We cannot recommend Summer Star Ranch highly enough! Thank you so much Starr and Matt!
