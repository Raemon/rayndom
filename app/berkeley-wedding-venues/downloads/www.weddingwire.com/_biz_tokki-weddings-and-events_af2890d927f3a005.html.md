Suzy made our Thailand wedding unforgettable!

I can't recommend Suzy enough for anyone looking to create a truly memorable wedding experience. She was always ready with the perfect suggestions that fit our vision and style. As we were planning our Thailand wedding festivities, Suzy was incredibly knowledgeable about fun activities for our guests during their time in Bangkok. She recommended a terrific rooftop bar for our welcome cocktail reception, which everyone loved, as well as an excellent hotel that catered to our guests' every need. For our wedding reception, she shared great options for take-home Thai desserts, which added a nice personal and unique touch to our special day. If you want someone who cares deeply about making your wedding unforgettable and personal to you, Suzy is the one to trust!

Amazing Experience 

I had the pleasure of working Tokki Wedding and Events for a few events during my wedding celebrations. From start to finish, I didn’t have to think about a single detail — and yet, every moment felt so personal and perfectly tailored to me. Suzy brought together all the people I love most in a setting that was fun, beautiful, and completely stress-free. I felt celebrated, relaxed, and truly seen. It’s rare to find someone who can take your vision and turn it into reality without needing constant input, but she did just that with grace and creativity. If you're looking for someone who will make your special event unforgettable while taking all the pressure off your shoulders, I can’t recommend her enough. She’s a true professional with a heart of gold!

Hire Suzy for your next event!

Suzy is kind, accommodating, and collaborative, making her a valuable partner for anyone who is looking for event planning services. From venue outreach and communications to day-of set up and coordination, Suzy was so helpful in making both my intimate wedding rehearsal dinner and larger welcome event with 100 guests real successes. I would recommend hiring Suzy for your next big event!
