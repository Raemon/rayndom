Rev. Deb was absolutely fabulous! From the very first conversation, we knew she was the perfect person to officiate our ceremony. Throughout the planning process, I called and emailed her many times while feeling overwhelmed, and she patiently answered every question with kindness and professionalism. She truly put us at ease. On our wedding day, the ceremony was more than we ever could have imagined—it was us. Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how beautiful our ceremony was. Thank you so much, Rev. Deb. She is truly the best!” Abby and Mark

Kevin was phenomenal to work with. We talked to a number of officiants and he was the first one we spoke to who really helped us understand the “vision” for our ceremony, even as we were still making it. He struck the perfect balance between guiding us through the ceremony structure and collaborating with us to realize our vision. He nailed everything in the ceremony itself and was such a positive part of the process from start to finish. We worked with great vendors across the board but Kevin was the one who helped us really get excited putting things together. Can’t recommend him highly enough!

Steven was super knowledgeable and helpful with the process of getting married! He provided us with everything we needed to get our marriage license and made the process smooth. He did an amazing job at the ceremony and had guests and my husband and i smiling and laughing. He does a great job making you feel comfortable and helping with the flow of everything! So glad we booked him!

Working with Justice Carol made our wedding ceremony so special. It could not be more clear how deeply she cares about her couples. She really took the time to get to know us through multiple phone calls and zoom sessions of just chatting about our wedding and our relationship. Her ceremony was beautiful and personal, and I had so many family and friends comment on how lovely it was. We definitely recommend Justice Carol!
