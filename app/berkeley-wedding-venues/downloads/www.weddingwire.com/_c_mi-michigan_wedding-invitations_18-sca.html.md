We had a winter wedding with a snowflake theme. Liz and her team did an amazing job bringing my ideas to life. They surprised me with their creativity! This is not your run-of-the-mill print shop. Most of the people who came in were immediately greeted by name and I soon felt like one of the family too! Just be sure to start early, even if you think you know what you want. There are soooooo many options that we didn't even know existed and so many choices to make, it took us awhile to decide. We got save the dates, invitations, thank you cards, a guest book, a seating chart, table numbers, ceremony programs, and stickers for our favors. Thank you Liz, Teaira, Meghan, Quinlyn, and Alex!

When I started planning my wedding I had no idea how expensive invitations would be. Everyone told me I would never be able to find the type of invitation I wanted for under $1000 dollars and I was determined to. When I first found this site, I was hesitant, but after ordering a sample and emailing with them back and forth, I felt 100% confident. Now 129 days until my wedding, I received my invitations and they are perfect, and may I add they were half the cost of what everyone thought I would be spending. They are classy, formal, amazing quality, and I could not be happier!! Thank you!!!!

I was referred to Soiree by Design by an acquaintance, who used Andrea for her wedding invitations and programs. Andrea was very flexible in meeting times and listened to my fiancé and I’s ideas. She turned around two mock ups in less than a week. We liked both and were able to mix and match to create “our” invitation, then tweaked the wording a little. Andrea was very responsive in my emails asking her suggestions on language to use, etc. Once decided, the invitations came in quickly and Andrea hand delivered them to my house since she was in the area! Andrea was very professional and a pleasure to work with. We had a very specific color (burnt orange), which came across beautifully as an accent in the invitations, and we even used it as the envelope color for the RSVP cards! The paper was beautiful and had some shimmer to it. We received a lot of compliments on our invitations, which, per my (now) husband and I’s request, were simple yet elegant. Best of all, I thought the cost was on par with our budget-conscious plan, and the quality of the product and service far exceeded my expectations. We would definitely work with Andrea and Soiree by Design again in the future!

Katie was great! She did our wedding invitations and we LOVED them and her! There's no other way to put it, she is amazing at what she does! She was incredibly helpful and made the process easy and enjoyable :) She did a wonderful job designing a one of a kind invitation based on our style. We definitely recommend Print Julep!

We bought our invitations from Meijer and then took them into QRP to have them printing off there as well as our response and reception cards and I was really impressed with the cost and the quality. It took them only 2 days to get them back to me and they were really cheap. We had 250 of each ran off and it only cost 100 dollars. I would definatley reccomend them!

Letrice made my paper fabulous. Outside of her being a genuinely nice person, she is passionate about her craft and it shows in her work. I used LeTrice for all of my stationary needs and her work was well worth every penny. From my save the dates to my menu cards, there was so much beauty and quality! She was flexible to changes, and even shipped my items to me at the LAST minute without so much as a second thought. Don't be fooled-your stationary is important and does set the tone for your event! Letrice is highly recommended in my book!

With Plush Paper Design, you're NOT just dealing with another huge nameless, faceless company-- you are dealing directly with the amazing designer, Kathleen! Kathleen is creative, flexible and extremely accommodating!! She kept in regular contact with me, making sure that all of my questions were answered thoroughly, and accommodated us with two custom designed invitations-- both came out looking incredible!! Kathleen takes all the stress out of coordinating invitations, envelopes, RSVP cards... She has already done it all for you with her beautiful collections. If you don't find just the right images, scripts, and sizes to fit your occasion, simply contact Kathleen and she will put her expertise to work for you!! She goes way above and beyond and deserves all the business she gets!!!

I had a very pleasant experience working with Sarah at Belletristics! I made menus, place cards, and signs for my wedding! They turned out beautifully and were very easy to print and cut out. I saved a lot of money and the results exceeded my expectations! I highly recommend this company for your diy wedding stationary!
