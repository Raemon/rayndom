Rev. Philip Sciscione officiated our wedding back on 11/4/2023 when he was located in PA and we couldn't have asked for anyone better to do so. He took the time to listen to what we wanted and delivered on our special day. I would highly recommend him and/or his lovely wife to officiate your wedding. 10/10

Great. Thank you for leading such a beautiful, faith-filled ceremony for our daughter's wedding. Your words and prayers made the service truly meaningful and memorable.

Troy was GREAT. I believe the services were worth the price. She is very helpful and made the process of our wedding run so smoothly. I highly recommend Troy as a wedding officiant if you are in the market for one. You will not be disappointed!

Kasey was the absolute best!!! He is a professional through and through. We had multiple friends and family reach out to us complimenting Kasey and saying how amazing the ceremony was. Kasey made everything personalized to us and it felt like he truly knew us as a couple. We were all highly impressed with his ceremony speech and his beautiful words that laid the foundation for us as newlyweds. His words will stick with us throughout our marriage. If you are looking for an officiant hire him! You will be blown away!

Alan was wonderful and helped make our special day perfect! We were able to have a very intimate, personal, and fun wedding which is exactly what we wanted! Meeting with Alan on zoom gave us the opportunity not only for him to get to know us as a couple and as individuals, but for us to get to know him as well since we don't live in Charleston and wouldn't be meeting him face to face until the actual ceremony. He was in constant communication with me, as well as my husband if either of us needed anything or had any questions. By the time our wedding day arrived, we new exactly what to do and what to expect! Im so glad I found and chose Alan with Two Guys and a Wedding!

Bettina was an absolutely exceptional celebrant. From the first time we consulted with her, she was on top of everything. She was very open about her rates and communication was a breeze! Her questionnaire and our correspondence helped us craft a beautiful and personal ceremony. Her bright and bubbly energy brought laughter, joy, and happy tears throughout our families. We couldn’t have asked for a better officiant!! We would, a million times over, recommend Bettina for any special occasion!

Lisa Baker is an incredible officiant! She helped us understand and navigate all of the legal parts to becoming married. She made our ceremony so personal. She listened to all we had to say and helped answer all questions. I loved everything about her.

They are the absolute best! Patrick is the guy to ask for. He made the entire day super easy, and was also super nice and lighthearted, making everyone laugh. He calmed our nerves when it got a little tense at times, was very considerate of our elders in the group, and had extreme attention to detail when it came to directing photography and music. I couldn’t recommend him enough!

Our civil wedding was one of the most beautiful and emotional moments of our lives. Mr. Eric was very courteous, kind, and professional throughout. From the moment you meet Mr. Eric, you realize how professional and wonderful a person he is. He treated us both with great respect, and it was a very beautiful and pleasant ceremony. We are very satisfied with the excellent job Mr. Eric did; it will be a cherished memory in our lives.
