The Farm made our wedding everything we imagined and more. The venue itself is stunning- especially when we had ours this fall! Even our rain plan, which we did just in case (we got lucky with beautiful weather despite a chance of rain), was perfect in the pavilion- the views of the pasture and mountains made for a gorgeous backdrop. Just as beautiful as the views is the amazing energy brought by the Farm’s team throughout the planning process, but especially our day of team who helped make it so magical and ensured that my husband and I were as stress free as possible. The food was incredible- I’ve had guests tell me it’s the best they’ve ever had at a wedding, and I agree! We did the family style, and it truly helped bring our table guests together in a way that buffet or plated can’t. We miss our day already. If we could do it all over again with the Farm, we absolutely would!

We highly recommend giving Starlight Meadow a chance as the venue for your wedding. We got married there this October, and it couldn’t have been more perfect. Jeremy, the owner, was incredibly responsive and helpful throughout the entire planning process, always answering our questions quickly and thoroughly. On the day of our wedding, the staff went above and beyond helping with cleanup, moving decorations from the ceremony site to the reception area, and taking care of so many small details that made the day run smoothly. Holly was especially amazing, making sure the groom didn’t see me before the ceremony and ensuring that we were getting exactly what we envisioned. Overall, our experience at Starlight Meadow was truly unforgettable, and we couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate our day.

We chose Chimney Pond for our wedding venue and couldn't have been happier! There are so many positive things to say about this venue outside of it's beautiful views. We initially spoke with Lauren and Raquel, but then worked primarily with Brooke and her team throughout the planning process, and she was incredible! We didn't want family to be stressed with setting up or breaking down for the event, so to have the venue do all of that was well worth the price. They provided a preferred vendor list who were all incredible and so friendly and professional. Their portal makes it so easy to organize the event, and being someone who tracks on spreadsheets, I loved being able to see all of the details in one location. It really helped make the planning process less stressful. Brooke was always available for messaging or a phone call and would give her thoughts and recommendations when we were unsure or wanted her help. It unfortunately started to rain the morning of our wedding and some throughout the day, which of course had me nervous and emotional. Brooke and her team were on it, from watching the radar to having umbrellas available, wiping down the chairs, and even pushing the ceremony time back so we could have it outside. It truly meant so much that they were doing everything possible for us to have the ceremony outdoors with the beautiful views. We didn't have a "dream wedding" in mind coming into wedding planning and felt like we were making a lot of decisions quickly (less than 1 year engagement), but after seeing it all come together, it came to be our dream wedding, and they made it all happen! Thank you for making our big day so special and so memorable! We can't thank you enough!

My (now) wife and I got married at Hawkesdene in September and could not have had a better experience. When we started envisioning our wedding, we pictured a wilderness retreat where we could spend quality time with our friends and family, and as a same-sex couple, we were especially keen on finding a venue where we felt valued and supported. Hawkesdene ended up being exactly what we were looking for. From start to finish, the team at Hawkesdene was incredibly helpful and accommodating. We started with a tour of the property, which was very well-manicured and included cute spots to sit and relax, a bonfire with ample seating, and a creek to dip your toes into. Spread throughout the grounds were a dozen or so cabins, each well-equipped and varied in size, making it easy to accommodate different groupings of guests. After we chose the venue, we went and stayed a night on the estate and had a planning session with Jami and Ashley. They were both incredibly knowledgeable and both accommodated our requests and advised us when we had any hesitations. Throughout the planning process, Jami and Ashley were very responsive to any questions we had about the property, our invitations, other vendors, etc., which was immensely helpful. On the weekend of our wedding, which ran from Thursday through Sunday, we had an amazing time with our loved ones! Our guests ranged from less than a year old to over 90 and everyone was well-accommodated and had an amazing time. The food was excellent, everything ran smoothly, and we got to spend a ton of time with everyone! On the day of our wedding, Ashley took care of all the décor for us and executed on our vision perfectly. We also had rain on our wedding day, and Jami and Ashley kept a close eye on the forecast and walked us through contingency plans in case we needed to change ceremony locations. We really valued being able to show up on Thursday, tell Jami and Ashley what we envisioned, and not have to worry about anything the whole weekend. We feel very fortunate to have had our wedding at Hawkesdene and highly recommend it for anyone searching for an outdoor retreat with your loved ones.

Choosing the perfect venue was one of the most important decisions for our wedding, and we couldn't be happier with our choice. From the moment we toured Oakhaven, we received truly exceptional care—anticipating our needs before we could even voice them and consistently going above and beyond to make us feel like family. Their warmth and attention to detail made the entire experience seamless and enjoyable. The venue itself is breathtaking, with beautifully landscaped grounds that offered countless photo opportunities. The multiple houses surrounding the venue allowed us more than enough room to have all our friends and family on site while having private space when needed. The Manor house and Cabin gave us peace of mind and allowed everyone in the wedding party to get ready in comfort. The elegant indoor spaces provided a warm and inviting setting for our celebration, and our guests were consistently impressed by both the ambiance and the attention to detail throughout the facilities. The best part, you never have to worry about sharing your weekend with any other party. The barn is updated and they recent addition added more room for us to comfortably fit all our guests, while having plenty of room to dance. One highlight was the accessory room, thoughtfully stocked with everything we needed to create unique details and added touches which saved us hundreds. One particularly unforgettable touch was the Model-T car available for our use. Taking photos with this classic car added a unique, vintage charm to our day, and the ride made us feel like stepping back in time. This thoughtful amenity was a guest favorite and made our celebration even more memorable. Jeanette, Elizabeth, Bob, Jaden, and Gary remained outstanding—professional, organized, and genuinely invested in making our day perfect. They worked closely with us during planning, offering helpful suggestions and listening to our ideas. Jeanette and Elizabeth saved our big day when we had issues with one of our vendors by finding a last-minute replacement. They also added little touches to the itinerary simply because they knew it would make me smile. On the wedding day, everything ran smoothly thanks to their expertise and unwavering support. Overall, our wedding exceeded all our dreams, thanks in large part to this incredible venue and its remarkable team. Patience (owner) and the staff pour their heart into making Oakhaven a one-of-a-kind venue. It shows in every way. They have so many nods to the past while incorporating modern amenities. We enthusiastically recommend it to any couple seeking a beautiful location, outstanding staff and amenities, and a truly unforgettable event.

My daughter and husband were married at this site in June 2022. We toured in fall of 2021, after what was then a serious flood. We, like most of the people who use this venue, arranged to stay on the site with the full wedding party and family members for 3 full nights and 4 days. So unlike the individuals that are commenting, we have first hand knowledge of the venue, the staff and the owner. First, the area that is shown fully flooded recently, is well above where past flooding has occurred. There is no way that anyone with knowledge and experience with this property would ever have thought that those upper pastures would flood at such a high level. Look at the picture of the reception tent. Water is almost to the tent level which is close to 9-10 feet off of the ground. This tent sits 400-500 yards from the river and is elevated from the river area in two progressions. The flood in 2021 didn't make it past the ponds at the first progression. No one could have anticipated anything like this. I would ask the individual who took this video that has caused all these callous comments that if they were so intelligent and had such foresight, why did they remain on the property during the storm or for that matter why did they book a venue that they knew would flood so dangerously? And the answer is simple, because they didn't know what was going to happen. Just like the owners and staff did not know or anyone else for that matter in the entire region. Please have a bit more empathy for people who are suffering and have lost maybe everything they have. I have met them and worked with them, seen them with their animals and I know that they are distraught over what has happened, so callously commenting with no first-hand knowledge of the geography or people just to make yourself feel better about your views on animal well-being has done no one a service, but has materially impacted real human beings. Good human beings.
