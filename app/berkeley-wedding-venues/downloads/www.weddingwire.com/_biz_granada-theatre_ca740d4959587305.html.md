Great wedding venue for photos!

I'm a professional wedding photographer and I've recently shot a wedding at Granada Ballroom. It's a great venue for weddings. The overall atmosphere, picturesque spots, and very helpful staff members play a huge success for any couple and create a magical moment for photographers. I can't wait to go back and do it again!

St. Patrick’s Day Wedding

I was an officiant at a wedding at the Granada Theatre in March, 2019. The venue itself is simply breathtaking. No detail was overlooked when they renovated this place. The staff of coordinators were nothing short of spectacular. They were on-time, professional, and accommodating in every way. It was the easiest staff with whom I’ve ever worked as an officiant. I cannot recommend the Granada Theatre highly enough!

..Classy.. 

I had my wedding (little over 200 people) this past April at The Granada Theater.   
  
The venue was inclusive with their own decorating team, coordinators, DJ, and catering, all a part of the Live Love Leal company. Some people like to be able to choose multiple vendors, but having them handle it all was well worth it. It's less stress, less meetings, more flow, and time to enjoy our engagement.   
  
My bridesmaids (who were already married) were buzzing how coordinated, attentive, and helpful Edith and Christina were (they still mention it to this day!). One of our family members were late in bringing home made desserts for the cocktail hour. I asked my husband to call his cousin to check with them, and immediately Christina pulls out her phone and turns to my husband asking him for the number so she can do it herself. Another time I was overwhelmed by all the socializing during cocktail hour, I ducked into the main ballroom to hide. Edith saw me and asked if i needed anything. I told her no, that everything was great. She then cocked her head to the side, squinted a little, and asked, "whats wrong?". I laughed and said it was just me and nothing else. She then asked if i wanted a chair to sit down or anything to eat and drink. Point is, they got your back brides!! The decor was executed wonderfully. We loved having our name in the marquee. We also had movie posters we customized on our own up outside. The chandeliers sparkled beautifully and give a Sinatra-esque vibe. For food, people couldn't stop talking about the hors d'oeuvres along with the pork osso bucco. I was slightly worried since at the tasting it was slightly flat, but at the wedding it was all fresh and people went back for seconds.   
  
Everyone kept raving after about the wedding :). My mom being Asian even had to throw out that people said ours was better than our cousin's that occurred two months after (weird flex?).  
  
I highly recommend Granada for your big day!

Wedding planning made easy with live+love+leal

From the moment Edith took us on a tour of this venue, we knew we were in for something special! We had narrowed down our venue search to a couple places we wanted to visit, and decided to visit the Granada Ballroom first. The venue is pretty unique, in that it used to be a theater, so I was a little skeptical on how nice it would look once we got there. We met up with Edith for a tour and were completely blown away! The ballroom was set up for an event later that week, so we were able to get a really good idea on how the layout would look if we decided to book there. This venue is 'all inclusive', so they handle everything from the catering, floral, cake/dessert, music and decor. This makes everything easier since there are less people to coordinate and interface with. We decided to have our wedding reception here and ended up working with Edith and Christina throughout our preparation. We really appreciated how prompt and thorough they were with all the questions we had and they were able to guide us through all the steps of planning our reception. The planning process went really smooth and everyone on the team was very knowledgeable and professional with us. The night of our reception, our guests kept raving on how nice the venue was and how amazing the staff and service were. The catering team was very attentive when we mentioned we had a few guests with allergies. They made sure they knew who was allergic to what, and even made modified versions of the hors d'oeuvres that they could enjoy! Not only was the level of service amazing, but the food and cake were also up to the same level, everything was great! We can't stress enough how stress free and easy the whole process was working with the team at the Granada Ballroom. We definitely recommend visiting to see for yourself, but just be prepared to fall in love with the place/staff and start planning your wedding there!

Phenomenal Venue and Staff

This review is long overdue, but I was having a really hard time trying to come up with the words to say how much we loved and appreciated working with Live Love Leal, Granada Theater and their staff.   
In short: 6 month engagement (5 months to plan w GT). Great food, beautiful venue, reasonably priced. Staff: Amazing, accommodating, extremely warm and professional staff.  
In long:   
Short engagement; getting frustrated finding a place in the Bay Area that met our needs: available, within a reasonable distance from our home (1 hour), fit approx 150 people, look nice, reasonably priced, have food that nut allergy safe (MOST other venues said no). We originally asked about Willow Heights Mansion, but Christina called back shortly after saying that the Mansion was not available, but they had two other properties: a classic movie theater and a vineyard. After touring Granada Theater we knew we found the perfect venue.   
Edith gave us a tour, helping us really imagine our wedding there. She walked us through what a typical day would be like giving a few ideas, so that we could start dreaming up our perfect day. Edith has such a warm positive energy about her that we couldn’t imagine going any where else.   
The planning is made so easy! They do everything there: food, decorations, cake, floral and DJ. They even know an officiant if you need one. Only the photographer was booked separately.  
For the decorations and floral, you will meet with Jeanine’s design team at the WH Mansion fine tuning the overall details. They have linens, centerpieces, pedestals, etc. In short, they have it all. They take their time with you, so they can really help to capture the look/feel that you want.   
For the food and cake, if you get one of their classic packages, they coordinate a dinner tasting with you, providing you with pages to take notes on, touching bases by the end of dinner to finalize your menu & cake flavors. We ended up with their BBQ buffet, which you can taste at their restaurant The Grove in Hollister. Whichever you choose, you can’t go wrong. All delicious. Side note: My nephew was so happy he wasn't singled out due to his allergies and was able to go thru the buffet. They also made sure meals for our vegetarian guests.   
We met with Christina in the final weeks, who had been truly instrumental since the beginning. She had been such an amazing help in guiding us through the whole process: outlining all of options, finalizing all the special details, and helping us to work within our budget.   
Our DJ, Darren, nailed it. I have never seen my family dance so much at a wedding.  
Day of, Christina and Edith were there for me all day! They made sure I had everything I needed, that we ate, and helped me repair my bustle multiple times all while keeping us on schedule.   
I cannot tell you how many compliments I received in the following weeks about how great the staff was, especially Edith, in making sure they were having a great time. The consideration shown by repeatedly checking on our guests was one of the most impressive things.   
To top all of this off, the staff maintained complete professional attitudes in the face of personal crisis. The Garlic Festival Shooting happened during dinner service, where coworkers and family members attended. Not once did staff ever let on something was wrong. We found out at the end of the evening, through a family member. The staff of Granada Theater is filled with truly amazing people. You will not be disappointed.

More than I could have imagined 

The Granada was the perfect venue for our wedding. The entire Leal crew was so helpful throughout the whole wedding planning process. They are a one stop shop (food, decor, venue, dj) so it makes the process that much easier. Our day of coordinator was awesome and she really was more than just a "day of" coordinator. She was always willing to help with my many emails/questions. They were able to make everything we wanted and needed happen! It was PERFECT!   
Leal has many venue spaces available so if you're looking for the perfect place to get married, choose one from them, you won't be disappointed!

My husband and I have the great pleasure to be the first wedding at Granada Theatre on October 6, 2017. Our wedding was phenomenal and beautifully executed! The Leal Granada Theatre team are truly amazing, especially our coordinator Ayumi. They are all very sweet and a fun group of people that were super attentive to us and our guest needs. The planning process was a breeze as they are very organized, responsive and professional. The food, cupcakes and taco truck were scrumptious and delicious. All of our guests were raving about it. And the beverage selection had everyone having a good time.   
Booking with Granada Theatre was an easy decision as it is an all-inclusive package, as I like to call it. In the ballroom you can have both the ceremony and reception. You get married onstage with a huge LED screen in the back. You can setup a laptop with fun video/graphics to make an “arbor”. The venue has a huge attached bar area and beautiful lobby. They have their own in house caterer and pastry chef. They also have a full in house design team that includes floral design, full table setup and chairs. A photo booth also comes with the package and you can add valet parking. Having our names on the marquee was such a special touch.   
If you are hesitant to setup a meeting or a venue walk thru, it might help to know that the owner of Granada Theatre also owns Willow Heights Mansion, Leal Vineyards, Sycamore Creek, The Barn and The Grove. And they do hundreds of weddings a year, so they really know what they are doing. We cannot recommend and thank Leal Granada Theatre enough!!
