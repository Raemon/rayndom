It was a beautiful wedding!! There were so many areas to choose from for your own picturesque moment. They only annoying thing was that the area wasn’t closed off to the public. But they mostly stayed out of the way.

I cannot say enough good things about this venue. Everyone is so easy to work with. From the moment we decided to get married here until the reception ended and we walked out, Hannah and Mrs. Aline (along with their staff) were there. The venue itself is GORGEOUS and the you cannot beat the price. Thanks Maison De Tours!

I specifically went back to this site because I remembered Courtney's 1 star review from when I was searching for wedding planners earlier this year. I'd like to say my experience with Lani Bailey could not have been more opposite. I had a four month engagement, and planning the wedding of my dreams would not have been possible without Lani. My wedding day was perfect, and I have no regrets. Lani guided me through every step of the planning process, staying in regular communication with me over email. She helped me find the most fabulous local vendors even though I was aiming for a fairly low $25,000 budget. On the day of the wedding, I never had to worry about where I needed to be. No one was bombarding me with questions. She managed every detail, even pieces I never would have thought of considering. Please consider choosing Lani as your wedding planner. You will not regret it.
