Located just south of the Kansas City metro in Centerville, Kansas, The Pumphouse Venue offers an elegant industrial setting to host your wedding celebrations. As a restored 1900s pump station, the venue boasts historic grandeur and flexibility so you can create the big day of your dreams. 

**Facilities and Capacity**

The Pumphouse Venue is a full-service estate so that you can host your entire day from start to finish here.

The spectacular indoor Chapel and Atrium for unforgettable ceremonies means you can tie the knot, whatever the season. Step inside the reception space, and the architecture speaks for itself. The cathedral-like atmosphere in the Grand Hall is accentuated by 36-foot peaked ceilings, exposed brick, and extravagant steel beams.

Beautiful Venue! 

I had the pleasure of attending my sister’s wedding reception at The Pumphouse Venue, and it was an absolutely wonderful experience.   
  
The space is beautiful, elegant, and thoughtfully designed, making it the perfect setting for celebrating with family and friends.  
  
The reception flowed seamlessly from start to finish. The layout made it easy for guests to move around comfortably, and there were so many stunning areas that created the perfect atmosphere for dinner, dancing, and photos. Everything felt intentional and well organized, which allowed guests to truly relax and enjoy the evening.  
  
The attention to detail throughout the venue really stood out. From the overall ambiance to how smoothly everything came together, The Pumphouse Venue played a major role in making the reception feel special and memorable.  
  
I would highly recommend The Pumphouse Venue to any couple looking for a beautiful and well-executed space to host their wedding reception.
