We had the best time at our wedding with Dylan! He made sure to incorporate all our song requests and played an amazing mix of music. Our guests were raving about him for days after!

I had an absolutely incredible experience with Trey Smith from 636 Entertainment at my wedding. From start to finish, Trey's professionalism and attention to detail were exceptional. He effortlessly created the perfect atmosphere, blending a diverse playlist that catered to all generations and kept the dance floor alive throughout the night. Trey's ability to read the crowd and adjust the music accordingly was impressive, and the sound quality and lighting setup were top-notch. I cannot recommend Trey Smith and 636 Entertainment enough – they truly made our wedding unforgettable!

They did a fantastic job, professional leading up to the wedding and fun when it was time to party. No issues with sound during the ceremony either. Would highly recommend this team!

Anna and setup technician did a great job setting up our "dance on the clouds". We found out on very late notice that the company we initially paid for this service were using a simple fog machine so we reached out to Anna just a few days before our wedding and Dancenhance Entertainment came through with a beautiful display for my wife and I's first dance! Reasonably priced considering late notice.

Bobby Riley was our DJ for Prom and he was terrific. We had some last minute change of plans and he rolled right on with us and it turned out just fantastic. The kids only complaint about their prom has been it wasn't long enough and that wasn't Bobby's fault! Lol I'm really hoping we can have him again next year.
