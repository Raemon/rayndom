We hired Happy Huckleberry Studios along with Events by Autumn for our wedding package. Our suite included save the dates, letterpress invitations, welcome letters/itineraries for our guests, buffet signage, custom table numbers, and thank you cards. For our invitations, we wanted a custom letter press design that represented the Montana mountains that would be visible from our wedding venue, which was executed perfectly! The whole process was seamless and collaborative, and we are incredibly happy with the final product. We just moved to New York City and one of the first pieces of art we put up was our framed wedding invitation!

I absolutely loved our invitations. She brought to life exactly what I had envisioned. There were so many wonderful touches, from vintage postage, to velvet envelope lining. They are so elegant & timeless!! Paper invitations are just such a romantic touch. She was also very easy to work with & always reassured me that you can change as much as you want, as many times as you want! I would absolutely recommend.

Sheba is not only a talented designer, but a true ARTIST! I've worked with her for many of my wedding couples for invitations and wedding day stationary (escort cards, menus, etc.). She is hands down my favorite stationary designer because of the care and thought she puts into every project. For couples wanting to stay away from the cookie-cutter, hire Sheba! She will craft an invitation suite you'll want to put in a frame and keep on your wall forever!
