The Oaks at Hooks Farm will always hold an incredibly special place in our hearts. We were honored to be the very first wedding ever held there, and the experience was truly unforgettable. From the moment we stepped onto the property, we knew it was something special. The setting is absolutely stunning, with beautiful oak trees, open space, and a peaceful, timeless feel that made our wedding day feel magical. Gail and her team were wonderful to work with and genuinely cared about making our day perfect. Even as their first wedding, everything felt thoughtful, intentional, and well-prepared. They were attentive, accommodating, and open to ideas, which made the planning process feel exciting rather than stressful. Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how beautiful the venue was, and we felt so lucky to be part of the beginning of what will clearly be an amazing wedding venue for many couples to come. We are so grateful to have trusted The Oaks at Hooks Farm with such an important day in our lives and would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone looking for a gorgeous, meaningful place to get married.

My daughter's wedding was held on a beautiful sunny day in November at The Grande, in Kennesaw, 1 year after she & her fiance selected the site. The Grande is a refurbished farmhouse with plenty of parking, excellent backdrops for photographs, & a spacious interior of lovely rooms which could accommodate the potential 158 guests. Our daughter & SIL, aficionados of all things farm house related, absolutely loved The Grande. We booked the venue immediately. The package included the wedding, reception, cake, DJ, & a credit towards floral. We found our own photographer & officiant. Then came a year of excellent, patient, service by each representative of The Grande. Grace in particular kindly shepherded my daughter, her eldest sister, & me each time we had a question or concern. By email, phone or text, we never had to wait or wonder. When the meeting for choosing particular decor came, the selections were immense; thank goodness I didn't have to lift a finger, just enjoy the process. It was also easy for my daughter & SIL to choose a menu from the food tasting meeting. The timeline of the reception meeting was smooth & thorough. During planning, after each meeting regarding choices of decor, food, flowers, & timeline, my daugher & SIL were emailed detailed information about each selection & corresponding cost of any thing they chose that was above the basic budget amount in the contract. Financially speaking, compared to other venues we visited, the bang for the buck at The Grande was simply amazing. Linda was our flawless wedding coordinator for the wedding rehearsal, wedding, & reception. She explained everything everyone needed to do & when. Due to her, the pacing of the reception events was perfect. No one had to wonder, "When will the pictures end?", "When will the bridal party come?" & the all important, "When can we get a drink?". The bar at the venue has a lovely turn of the century ambiance. We provided our own alcohol. We chose to have one extra bartender for the duration of the reception, for a very small fee, either $100 or $150, I can't recall. With 2 entrances/exits, the bar was never crowded. The DJ was professional. He played the 5 or 6 songs the wedding couple requested. He also played extensively from the list of 30 or so songs I suggested. Cutting the cake, throwing the bouquet, the garter toss, the gathering for send-off bubbles - all went so well, due to Linda's expertise. During the 3-plus hours of the reception, Linda came numerous times to ask if I needed anything, or had any requests. She had encyclopedic knowledge of the particulars of my daughter's wedding; she knew way more than I did. However, there were times when she asked my opinion. For instance, setting up the candy bar & my preferences. My go to answer was always, "hmmm, I don't know. Do what you think is best" And Linda quietly, efficiently, made it work. We ended up with 117 'yes' RSVP's, but less people actually attended. There was never an issue with crowding or waiting. I was told by several people how much they enjoyed the entire event & how fast it went. In sum, I found each representative of The Grande, with whom I spoke, to be kind, patient, & efficient. I wish I had known about The Grande when my eldest daughter married! While her wedding was lovely, it did not have the ease of the wedding planning The Grande provided. Truly a lovely venue, with lovely people, &.....an amazing price!

We were looking for something in our budget and this venue was the perfect one, besides money wise we were looking for something flexible for catering and I like the natural look with the wood and the view was so perfect for what I was looking, we would definitely recommend this place. On our wedding day it rained couldn’t use the outside space but I still loved!!

The Barn at Oak Manor is such a beautiful property! From the manor where we spent our mornings, to the great oak standing tall behind the ceremony platform, to the deck overlooking the eloquent pond at cocktail hour, this venue captivated its audience with rustic charm and natural beauty. While spacious, each location within the venue could easily be traversed by all ages and physicality. We had a small wedding: 54 people in total. Our party would have been dwarfed by the venue, had it not been for the wedding coordinator’s effective use of the space. Not to mention the farmhouse-chic style she lent the barn for our after party. (On that note, props to Ashley who hand picks her decorations for her clients to use.) While our ceremony took place in August 2022, it was originally slated for August 2021. Low and behold, COVID caused us to postpone our exciting day. But, we wouldn’t let this postpone the day we had set in our hearts. We contacted Ashley and told her the situation. Not only did she call all of our vendors to let them know we would be postponing the wedding, Ashley let us use the venue for an elopement ceremony that was both intimate and special. I will be forever thankful, especially considering the circumstances, that our wedding day turned out to be the day of our dreams.

I can’t say enough about how perfect our experience was at Gaithers for my daughter’s wedding. The staff was like working with family. Beautiful venue! Large and spread out! Very accommodating for any event. Emoni and Mr Tim were so very kind and worked so hard to make our day special. So much gratitude for that

I just have to give a huge shoutout to Mighty Hacker Recovery for coming through in the clutch for me! I lost my wallet phrase key for my digital currency and was freaking out, but they managed to help me recover it in just a few hours after reaching out to them. It was such a relief to have access to my funds again, and I can't thank them enough for their quick and reliable service. If anyone out there is dealing with similar issues or needs help with hacking services like school grade upgrades or credit score improvements, I highly recommend reaching out to Mighty Hacker Recovery. They are the best in the business and you can find them on all platforms. Trust me, you won't be disappointed with their expertise and professionalism. Thank you, Mighty Hacker Recovery!

When we first went to look at the venue we instantly knew this was the place for us. the venue itself is so beautiful. On top of that everyone that works there went above and beyond for us from providing trusted recommend vendors (which all did great) to waking us through every detail of our day. We are so grateful for RGF making our big day so special.

There will never be enough good things to say about our wedding venue! Every single detail of this place made for the best night we could have ever imagined! Mike & Renty were perfection at making sure that everything we needed/wanted was taken care of for us! Coming from out of town and having booked the venue before even seeing it was a little scary but we couldn’t be happier with our choice. 10/10 would recommend them to anyone looking for a top notch place to celebrate their big day! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Vinewood Stables was a dream! Their all-inclusive features allowed me to actually ENJOY planning my wedding without stressing over the small items. Their services allowed me to work a full-time job and plan an incredible wedding in 6 months. Diane was a DREAM and her and her team happily accommodated some of my requests that made my wedding feel unique and special to my husband and I. All of our guests keep telling us how gorgeous the venue was, how spectacular the food was, and how the ice cream bar was the best idea ever! We are so grateful to all of the event staff who were so friendly and seemed to genuinely enjoy being there to celebrate us. We loved the versatility of the venue (multiple photo spots) and the grounds are so beautiful, we didn’t have to add a lot of decor to enhance it. If you want an stress-free and dream wedding day, I cannot recommend Vinewood Stables enough!
