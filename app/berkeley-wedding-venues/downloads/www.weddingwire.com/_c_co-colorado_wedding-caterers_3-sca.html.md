We had a wonderful experience working with Alexa and the catering team at Savory! After a delicious tasting at Savory, we knew we wanted them to be our caterer for our Welcome Reception at Rembrandt Yard in Boulder. We had an Italian style buffet and we received compliments throughout the evening from our guests about how much they were enjoying the food! Savory made kids' meals for our younger guests, and the kids told us they were delicious. We also ordered desserts from Savory and their chocolate mousse cups and brownies were the perfect treats! Throughout the evening, the staff at Savory was attentive, kind, offered to help us unload and carry up our Welcome Bags from the car, and even recycled the boxes we used to transport the bags! The did a great job at packaging up our leftovers. Alexa was the best to work with! She was quick to respond to emails, made the planning process easy, offered great suggestions, and was present at our final planning meeting with Rembrandt Yard. I could tell she truly cared about our event and wanted us to have a great evening! Savory went above and beyond for us, and we highly recommend working with Savory as your caterer!!

I have been to a few weddings in my life and they love to serve the typical white-chicken-and-asparagus-with-a-beef-option, and that's fine, but I wanted to actually enjoy my dinner at my own wedding. And let me tell you: going with Smoke Shack was brilliant. Holy guacamole, they knocked it out of the park. It's no wonder they've won tons of awards -- I want to give them an award! They were the hight of professionalism, and their barbecue cannot be beat. If you're worried someone in your family might not like barbecue, this will change their life forever. I cannot recommend Smoke Shack enough for their delicious food, quality of service, and amazing staff!

Loved Footers! They were so wonderful to work with from start to finish! They provide any and all you could possibly want for food on your wedding day! They The food was delicious and the dessert bites as well. Our guests were raving about the night and how delicious everything was. Even with the rain storm, everyone worked above and beyond to make sure food was served hot and timely. Along with constant smiles through all the extra work the rain provided, they wore masks to join in our masquerade ball cocktail hour! So fun!

Working with Samantha from Three Leaf Catering was such a wonderful experience! She is incredibly knowledgeable in her field and made the entire catering process feel easy and seamless for both the couple and for me as the planner. Her calm, grounded presence paired with her efficient work ethic was such a gift both leading up to the event and on the wedding day itself. Three Leaf’s plant-forward menu is always a standout, and the food was absolutely delicious — guests raved about it all night! Samantha’s professionalism, communication, and genuine kindness made collaborating with her an absolute pleasure. I would happily recommend Three Leaf Catering to any couple looking for amazing food and a truly supportive, thoughtful catering team.

With a Twist was the perfect bartending service for our 100-person wedding in September. They offer a variety of packages and were communicative from the initial inquiry to the wedding day. We did the complete beer & wine package, which came with the mobile bar, ice, and some extra nonalcoholic offerings for our guests, and the bartenders were efficient and kind. Jacob and I were never without a drink in hand during the night thanks to their awesome service! We would recommend With a Twist to anyone!

Jules Gourmet did what many other caterers would not or could not do: she helped me create my unique and custom menu, was flexible and understanding, she listened and heard what I wanted, and she delivered beyond expectations. The food was amazing and she is a dynamo. Thank you Jules!!!

We had Brothers cater our engagement party and it was such a hit that we hired them again for my dad’s birthday. Both events were amazing and our guests couldn’t stop talking about how good the food was. Jazmine was incredibly helpful and responsive both leading up to and during both events. The food was delicious and the experience was great. 10/10 recommend!
