My husband and I got married at Jimmy’s Jazz & Blues Club in June 2025, and it was truly the most special day at the most incredible venue. From the moment we left our initial tour, we knew our search was over—we wanted something different, and Jimmy’s Jazz was unlike any venue we had seen. The space itself is stunning, unique, and so much fun. Our guests are still raving about how beautiful and memorable it was, and many have told us it was the most fun they’ve ever had at a wedding. The venue really lends itself to that energy. Having the stage was such a standout detail—it felt like having our own private concert, and our band was genuinely excited to perform there. The food was absolutely incredible and exceeded our expectations. The team was so accommodating with our requests, from swapping out sides to offering several mini desserts instead of a traditional cake, and even adding a mocktail option. Everything was thoughtful, delicious, and beautifully executed. The flow of the night was seamless. We loved being able to use the art gallery for cocktail hour—it was spacious, visually striking, and perfect for guests to mingle. Multiple bars kept things moving smoothly, and the bartending staff were true rockstars. The team also flipped the main room from ceremony to reception with impressive efficiency and care. Rachel, the Event Director, was an absolute dream to work with. She answered all of my many questions with patience and warmth, made me feel completely comfortable and confident throughout the planning process, and helped ensure everything ran smoothly on the big day. The entire staff was professional, attentive, and genuinely wonderful. As an added bonus, we had access to the rooftop, which allowed us to take incredible photos with downtown Portsmouth as the backdrop. We love Jimmy’s Jazz and can’t wait to come back for a show. We truly cannot recommend this venue enough—especially if you’re looking for a stunning, unique, and unforgettable wedding experience.

This space was the beautiful industrial mill background I wanted for our wedding, situated in downtown laconia but right on the river, so many beautiful spots to take photos. They allowed a decent amount of decorating & were flexible with us about setup. It is a DIY sort of venue where you bring your own vendors which gave us an opportunity to really create the wedding we wanted.

Where to start… When choosing a venue, my fiancé and I had a very specific vision - an all indoor venue that was not a country club, barn, fancy hall, vineyard, etc. From the moment we walked into La Pièce after touring only one other venue, I immediately knew it was the one. From the copper bar area, to the perfectly laid out space, the large windows overlooking the Winnipesaukee River and the beautiful exposed brick accented perfectly by the wooden beams and hardwood floors, it was a true pinch me moment. We met Anna for our tour and we immediately clicked. The way she absolutely lit up when telling the backstory of the venue and how it came to be and the attention to detail of every corner of the spaces reassured me that not only was this venue the one, but SHE was the one that we wanted to work alongside to create our perfect day. We proceeded to have our calls with Anna and at no point did we feel as though we were not being heard or our vision was being overlooked. She was able to provide us with a customizable package that was not only within our budget, but well exceeded our expectations. She made finding additional vendors (specifically our DJ and caterer) stress-free and enjoyable. Knowing they work with specific vendors that are familiar with their venue and have been carefully vetted gave us peace of mind. Being a creative, hands-on person who was eager to take on some of the work myself combined with Anna’s expertise (Designs by Anna!) was an absolute dream. Anna embraced my every detail and DIY project while making sure our visions aligned and no detail was overlooked. She embraced every suggestion and request I had, never made me feel as though I was being a pest and reassured me that everything would be perfect. Seeing our two worlds and visions mesh seamlessly on our wedding day was nothing short of amazing. (I know they say to never sweat the small stuff, but it all proved to me that sweating the small stuff is worth it, haha.) From start to finish, the entire day/night was flawless and there wasn’t a single point in which we regretted our decision to go with La Pièce as our venue. In addition to our wedding, we also hosted our rehearsal dinner the night before. The food was fantastic, Anna and Jasmine (apologies if I spelled her name incorrectly!) ran the ceremony rehearsal in an organized and timely fashion allowing us all to get to dinner on time and enjoy our time with our wedding party. Every single person we interacted with throughout our experience was just amazing, whether it was Gabrielle as our first ‘email’ point of contact, David during our drink tasting, Jasmine throughout the rehearsal and day of, as well as the outstanding bartenders that took care of us and our guests throughout the entirety of the night. Each and every encounter was just further confirmation that Anna has built an incredible team of people who truly enjoy their work and care about the experience from start to finish. We had countless friends and family come to us throughout the night expressing how beautiful everything was and how wonderful the bartenders and all staff were to them throughout the evening. Long story short… We LOVE you, Anna! And the team, space and dream you’ve built! I’m already plotting how I can convince my now husband that we need an encore.

The Hamilton House was the perfect venue for our wedding ceremony! We chose to have a micro wedding, and the garden setting in August couldn’t have been more ideal. The intimate scale of our wedding fit seamlessly into the garden’s natural beauty, creating a romantic setting that felt both personal and picturesque. The Langdon House provided a stunning historic backdrop that elevated the entire experience. If you're looking for a venue that combines natural beauty with classic New England charm, The Hamilton House is truly a gem.

We had our wedding at The Winthrop Carter House in August of 2021. This was the perfect venue for what we were looking for in our wedding weekend. Having the opportunity to spend the whole weekend right at the venue with our bridal party made for such terrific memories, and our families and guests were all able to stay just down the road in Concord. The house was spacious and comfortable, and made for great wedding photos in the barn and bridal room. We had plenty of space throughout the whole grounds for our entire wedding weekend, we used the barn for our rehearsal dinner, and we had a beautiful outdoor ceremony out in the back garden followed by the reception in the back lawn where we had rented a large tent. Katie and Colm were very helpful throughout the planning process, and we can't recommend the venue enough for your wedding weekend!

I cannot say enough positive things about the Rosewood Country Inn as a wedding venue. This venue is special in that you get the entire 11-room inn for the weekend (Fri-Sun), and so we were able to have our closest friends and family staying with us, which was a blast! The inn offers a beautiful country setting on the outside that is perfect for an outdoor ceremony. We held ours at the gazebo in the courtyard, which was surrounded by beautiful trees and scenery that make for gorgeous pictures. The dining hall of the inn hosts the reception, and is perfect for an intimate and stylish dining experience that then morphs a dance floor! The food is excellent (Stan's stuffed french toast can't be missed), not only for the reception but the rehearsal dinner and breakfasts on Sat and Sun. Stan and Odo are extremely kind and gracious hosts, who let us make our wedding truly our own!

My husband I were married a the Old Meeting House in Francestown. The OMH is a beautifully restored classic New England setting for a wedding....Our wedding went off without a hitch, everything went as planned. Truly a very picturesque setting. We had singers come up from Boston, the acoustics were great.
