We got married in late July at The Gardens at Heather Farm Park, and it was truly the most perfect day. This venue holds such a special place in our hearts. My husband asked me to be his girlfriend under the gazebo years ago, and later proposed under the same gazebo. Choosing to get married where it all began was a complete no-brainer. We had a ceremony-only wedding, and the gardens were absolutely breathtaking. Every flower was fully bloomed, the grounds were stunning, and the atmosphere felt magical. So many of our guests, especially those visiting from outside Walnut Creek and neighboring cities, could not stop complimenting the venue. Many even took time to wander the gardens and take their own photos because it was just that beautiful. I cannot say enough good things about Cathleen and the entire GHF team. They were incredible to work with and made everything feel seamless and stress-free. The weather was perfect, the venue was perfect, and honestly, everything was perfect. It was truly the best day of my life, and I will forever be grateful that we were able to say I do in such a meaningful and beautiful place.

I recently hosted my third bridal shower at Boundary Oak, and once again, it was absolutely flawless. At this point, I’ve become something of a serial matron of honor (dear lord, no more... I say that every time), and each time I’m tasked with planning a shower, I know exactly where to go. Boundary Oak has become my go-to for a reason. The venue is beautiful, the setting is perfect, and most importantly, the team is truly exceptional. Angelique and the staff are incredibly professional, responsive, and thoughtful in every step of the process. They make planning easy, even when you’re juggling a hundred other wedding-related tasks. The space is bright, elegant, and adaptable for any vibe you're going for, and the views never fail to impress. The food is always a hit: fresh, well-presented, and something guests actually talk about afterward. And the staff during the event is just as amazing as the planning team: attentive, friendly, and on top of everything without being overbearing. After three showers here, I can confidently say that much of the praise I get for these events really belongs to Boundary Oak. They consistently deliver a smooth, high-quality experience that makes me look like I know exactly what I’m doing, even when I’m just trying to survive another round of bridal duties. If you're planning a bridal shower (or any celebration, really), I can’t recommend them enough. I’ll be back again... though hopefully as just a guest next time.

We loved getting married at the Ruth Bancroft Garden! We got married there at the end of April when everything was in bloom in the garden and it was so so beautiful. The team was so nice and kind and super responsive. Tawny was so great to work with from booking the venue to the execution of the event and responded so kindly to all my questions. She has an amazing team and they also work to set up all the chairs and tables and stay on site for the whole event. She worked seamlessly with our coordinators, Contigo Events, to make sure the wedding ran smoothly! I found this venue to be very affordable compared to a lot of venues in the Bay Area and it was one of the most beautiful venues that me and my husband looked at. We were very picky and were looking for the perfect place to have a garden-y wedding where we could have a delicious meal outside in a beautiful location and we were so lucky to have found Ruth Bancroft! The garden feels so intimate, there are so many different nooks that you can explore, and so many cool plants. We had a 45 person wedding and it was just worked wonderfully. We also loved that we were able to bring in our own vendors -- we were able to save a lot of money on food and alcohol by having our event here. You do have to bring everything in yourself, except for tables and some miscellaneous furniture, but it was very worth it to us to customize our event and save money on food and bev that are usually even more marked up at all-in event centers. We 1000% recommend Ruth Bancroft Garden for your wedding venue. Such a beautiful garden and an amazing team!! We had no hiccups planning the wedding and our day went perfectly, we can't recommend them enough!

My husband and I had our wedding reception at the main ballroom at Marriott. A lot of the stress associated with planning our big day was alleviated with the help of Marriott's awesome wedding coordinator, Rebekah Bridges. We actually had to change the date of our wedding and move it up two months because of out of the country relatives. We were anticipating that the change would be nearly impossible, or be so chaotic and stressful but with Rebekah's assistance, finding an alternative date was quick and so easy! What we liked about Marriott's was the quality of service Rebekah and the other staff provided. They were flexible and very accommodating as well as responsive to our needs. Just as the planning went well, the day of also ran smoothly. Marriott and Rebekah consistently provided us with 5 star service and at such a reasonable price!! Most of our 250 guests stayed at Marriott. For us and them, reserving and booking rooms was a breeze. As a bonus, Rebekah made it possible for my husband and I to spend our first night as husband and wife at the presidential suite. What a treat!!!!! The room was enormous with a full sized living and dining room as well as an adjoining conference room, with a total of three bathrooms. The space was definitely appreciated and used as I had our mothers, all my bridesmaids, and other relatives get their hair and makeup done in the suite the morning before the ceremony. We would definitely recommend this venue if you're looking for a warm and elegant venue that offers 5 star quality service. You definitely get the most bang for your buck at this place.

We loved our reception room. It was beautiful! The room was decorated as we had discussed. Our reception started at 1730 and the sun was quite bright on the stage area. This left some of guests a little blinded with no solutions. The food was delicious! But they were not going to bend on spending money on food and beverage. Overall, it was well worth our money.
