Wedding DJ

Danny and his team were amazing at our wedding. Everyone loved that our DJ new what to play to keep the party going. He offered up lighting and it added such a wonderful touch to our venue. I highly recommend Ultimate Sound Productions for any of your DJ needs. We also used them for my daughter graduation party a few years ago and all the kids loved it. We currently have him booked for my oldest daughter's wedding next year and Danny was on top of everything we needed as always.

Dj and mc were very helpful and kept the pace of events moving in a timely fashion. 

Was professional and helpful with the timing of each song for each part of the ceremony. Also was able to burn a cd of songs for the church. Provided uplighting with our color of choice.
