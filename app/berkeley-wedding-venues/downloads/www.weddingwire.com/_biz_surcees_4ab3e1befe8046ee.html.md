Such a dreamy day ❤️

Where do I even begin with this review?  
We had our wedding here on April 30th 2021 and it was an absolute DREAM. The day was perfect from beginning to end.  
  
First of all this venue is stunning. If you’re wanting a smaller wedding but you don’t want to sacrifice having a beautiful venue, this is your place.  
We had about 40 people in attendance and it was perfect.  
  
Second of all, HIRE THE COORDINATION TEAM, the people that run this well oiled machine are everything.  
Kathleen, it is very clear that you work your butt off and you do it so well and effortlessly. She was seriously an angel.   
  
THE FOOD. We got soooo many compliments on the food. And they were all correct, it’s incredible.  
The KSHG team even did our cake and it was unbelievable.   
  
They seriously thought of everything from making sure we had a glass of champagne immediately after the ceremony, to bringing us hors d’oeuvres while we had a few minutes of alone time to sign our marriage license, to even dropping off the stuff we left at the end of the night to our Airbnb.  
  
Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!

Upstairs at Midtown is AMAZING! 

If you are planning a small intimate wedding ceremony & reception in downtown Charleston, Upstairs at Midtown is just your place. While planning our impromptu destination wedding- time allowed for only ONE visit, and one visit was all it took to know it was our spot! From the exceptional customer service and continuous communication with Sofie and her team- it was as if I was there everyday at the venue helping them prepare for our special day. Having to forgo the opportunity of a food tasting, we were a little apprehensive but let me tell you! It was amazing! Our guests ranted and raved about the food all night and for weeks to come. From the hand passed apps, displayed tables, and un-traditional tapas style affair, Upstairs at Midtown gave our guests so much to talk about. Our guests as well as ourselves, were touched at how attentive the staff was. Drinks were always full, and bellies were always fed. They really brought the “family” essence to the evening, and it was truly magical. The newly updated bridal suite on the 3rd floor was not there when we toured the venue and to see it there, day of was awesome! A nice place to slip away and get a moment to breathe, before during and after your night of celebration is simply another detail not missed. We would truly relive the night over again if we could. Thank you, Upstairs at Midtown.

Friendly professionals who will help you every step of the way!

We choose Upstairs at Midtown as the venue for our wedding in April of 2022. We recommend this venue wholeheartedly. From the preparations, to the service to the food and drink, everything was top of the line. The kindness, the smiles, the patience of the staff members, helped us create an unforgettable memory. A big Thank You for Maddie and all the staff members! Cindy and Case

Everything we could have hoped for!

I booked with KSHG at Upstairs at Midtown for our destination wedding to Charleston. I had a virtual tour of the venue but didn't see it in person until wedding weekend. These ladies did a phenomenal job in helping me plan with their prompt email responses and thorough answers to any question. The venue is GORGEOUS and all my guests adored how nice and welcoming the staff was. The phrase "best wedding food I've ever had" was overheard at several tables during dinner. My favorite options were the mini chicken and waffle and the shrimp and grits! KSHG truly is great at what they do and go above and beyond to making your wedding day special and accommodate everyone. I'm so glad I held my wedding reception here!

Amazing venue!!

We could have not asked for a better experience at Upstairs at Midtown. The staff, service, and food were beyond compare. Sofie and Maddie made everything so easy and stress free. The service was white glove and exceptional. The food was "the best wedding food we have ever had"-guests. They really know how to make you feel special. If we every get married again, we will definitely be having the wedding here :-).

The best last minute decision we've ever made!

The venue, the team, and our wedding night were everything we wished for and then some. After some last minute, unexpected issues with a prior venue we had just over a month to “re-plan” our wedding and were lucky enough to stumble across Upstairs at Midtown. From our very first phone call with Sofie we knew we were in good hands. The King Street Hospitality Group bent over backwards and went the extra mile in every possible way. They were responsive, diligent, and extremely friendly. They took an interest in our wedding as if it were their own. We planned from 500+ miles away, site unseen, and our wedding night turned out to better than we could have ever imagined. Once we arrived on our wedding day, Kathleen and Maddie took all possible stress off of our shoulders and let us truly live in the moment. The venue was beautiful, the location was perfect, the food was spectacular, the hospitality was one-of a kind…. Nothing but good things to say!

Historical, Charming, Beautiful Venue + Incredible Food and Staff 

We had our wedding at Upstairs at Midtown in November and it was a magical, joyous and gorgeous affair. While this was not our original plan, location or state - our wedding turned out to be absolutely wonderful and essentially everything we envisioned for our special day.   
  
The Upstairs at Midtown venue is gorgeous. It's intimate, historical, charming, and is a great blank slate to make it your own or just let the natural historical beauty fill the space with elegance. We loved having the outdoor rooftop and market lights - such a great touch!  
  
The Upstairs and King Street Hospitality team was outstanding. Honestly, I think almost every single person that attended our wedding raved about the food especially - the chicken and waffle appetizer was the star of the evening! I had people trying to bribe the team to give them the recipe, it was that good! The staff was wonderful, the service was wonderful, the setting was wonderful - seriously an all together wonderful team, space and evening!

Great Location, Staff and Venue! 

I booked this space for a bridal shower and it exceeded my expectations! You cannot beat the location. Located in the heart of downtown Charleston right on King Street. Staff was very helpful and accommodating. Would 100% recommend this venue and the management group to anyone interested in throwing a bridal shower, baby shower, wedding and etc. they can do it all!

Perfect venue

Upstairs at Midtown was the perfect place for our wedding. The staff was PHENOMENAL. They helped us every step of the way in planning and made us feel extremely safe in the midst of a pandemic. From the food, to the drinks, and the entire set up, Upstairs at Midtown is and was exceptional. Highly recommend!!
