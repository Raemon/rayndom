One of our lovely couples had a wedding at Silver Creek Valley Country Club this fall. Life.Film team really enjoyed the location by being wedding photographers and videographers there.  
  
The event manager of the venue had contact us several month before the day of and invited for the tour around the venue. She shows us all the best spots for the pictures and explained us the policy for the photographers there.  
  
The location has plenty of spot for the great wedding photos wasteful area, ceremony area, staircase Such a pleasure to work at this beautiful location for us!  
  
Can’t wait to capture our next event there.

Risa is amazing! She helped coordinate our whole day and when it got down to the wire- she kept us on track so we wouldn't lose our schedule. When I had questions after business hours ( and I had a lot) she was right there.. Emailing me back with no hesitation. . The venue was absolutely stunning!

Silver Creek Valley Country Club was a great place to have the wedding. Everyone was great to work with and helped make the day as smooth as possible. Any problems that came up they handled without me or my family being bothered. The ceremony was beautiful by the waterfalls and all the new landscaping. I would recommend this to anyone.

Silver Creek was the first venue that we looked at. Nothing else could compare after that. Not only was it the MOST elegant and classy place, but the wedding coordinator, Denise, made it so much more worth it's while. Everyone at our wedding was beyond impressed with every nuance. We felt so blessed and proud. We would recommend Silver Creek Valley Country Club to anyone looking for a high class, well organized, easy and elegant wedding venue.

Excellent venue with stunning views. I wanted an outdoors venue feel but my parents want the comfort of indoors so this is a perfect combination! The coordinator Susanna was very friendly and helpful and even helped to work with our budget. The bakery they come with is excellent.. cake design turn out to be exactly what I want and it is yummy. Many guests complimented on the food too although I think the Salmon is excellent but not the steak. Overall, highly recommend this palce.

My brother and his fiance were married at Silver Creek Country Club on 7/25/15. They used the perfectly situated outdoor gazebo area for the ceremony and the grand ballroom for the reception, which overlooked the manicured golf course. We had about 150 guests. They were very accommodating when we needed to drop off items in advance for our traditional table setting. They took our wedding programs the day before, and laid them out on the chairs on the day of the ceremony. They allowed us to use our own catering. They had a cocktail hour in between the ceremony and reception, on a balcony overlooking the golf course. The service was excellent, professional and timely. The table settings were tasteful, stylish and well done. The venue was beautiful, serene and lovely, befitting the gorgeous bride and handsome groom, and all the guests who had flown in from far and wide to partake in the festivities.

Once we saw this venue, we fell in love and no other place could compare. This place is gorgeous! We had so many compliments! Our coordinator, Risa, was awesome and she went above and beyond for us. The only drawback was the price...this place is pretty costly, but it's so beautiful that what can you expect? Regardless, we loved it and would get married here again all over if we could!

I was married here on August 23, 2013 and it was a smashing success!! Our guests had the time of their lives, the scenery was picture perfect, and the food was divine.   
  
We had to rush this wedding in 6 weeks, so the planning phase was a little difficult. Our director of catering, Susanna G. is a very busy woman (she does EVERYTHING!!) so sometimes it was tricky getting a hold of her, but she was always sending email responses at midnight, so I know she put her effort in.   
  
The cost is expensive, but you get a lot for your money. It is a gorgeous venue, and the food really is wonderful, so if you can get past the price, it's worth it. Just be mindful of the 20% service charge (which most places charge anyway, but it still caught us off guard).   
  
Regardless, it was a night to remember, and the staff did a great job making sure everything went smoothly. Very happy bride here!!

Silver Creek Valley Country Club is the most beautiful wedding venue in the South Bay in my opinion and I would have my wedding there again in a heart beat. The only problem I had was with the wedding coordinator. Denise is very professional but she's also very by the book. Everything has to be done with the club rules and timeline and there's no room for change. I didn't get the feeling that she went out of her way to help us and that's something I expect from such a high scale place. For example, I was supposed to drop off our wedding favors the night of the rehearsal but forgot. I sent them instead the day of the wedding but she couldn't find them so she just didn't put them out. She didn't bother calling me and asking where they are, even though I had sent her a note telling her they are there. Her response later to me was too bad, you should have brought them earlier.   
I have to add in that when I contacted Denise a year later to tell her our original photographer was a scam artist and ran off with our photos and we would like to do a re-shoot at Silver Creek, she was very kind and allowed us to come in on a day the club was closed. Overall she was nice to work with, just don't expect her to jump over hoops for you.
