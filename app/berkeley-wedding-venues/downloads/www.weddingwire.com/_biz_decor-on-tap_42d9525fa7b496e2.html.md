White umbrella rental 

We rented white umbrellas through Bailee at Decor on Tap, and they were perfect! They were surprisingly hard to track down, but she made it happen and handled everything seamlessly. She dropped them off and picked them up, which made things so easy for us. Bailee was so sweet and easy to work with, we’re so glad we found her!
