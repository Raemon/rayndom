Leah and the rest of her staff at Envision Wedding Studio are absolutely amazing!!! My husband and I were living about 4 hours out of the area during the time we were planning our wedding in Sioux Falls but Leah was so helpful in making it a stress free and enjoyable experience!! I knew with my type A personality from the second we got engaged I was going to need to be able to give all control to someone on the day of the wedding so my husband, family and myself could relax on the wedding day and truly enjoy spending time with those we love most. Leah was the perfect person for the job. She helped us customize a package that filled spots we didn't want us or our family to have to deal with on the day of the wedding. She answered countless emails and phone calls to help provide the perfect atmosphere for our wedding and nailed the vision I had by just showing her a few pictures. She was extremely flexible by adjusting her schedule when we were in town and even came out to the ceremony venue with us since she had never had a wedding there before. She helped me feel completely relaxed during the whole process and the day before the wedding she told me to drop off all the decor I had for the ceremony and reception venues and took care of it all!! Her attention to detail and style just blew me away. I couldn't be more thankful for our decision to have Leah be such a big part of our day and I would recommend her studio to anyone needing a little or a lot of help to put together their perfect day!!

For the longest time, my fiancé and I could not find wedding invitations that we agreed on...and then we found Gwen Marie. Not only were her invitations beautiful, unique, and customizable, she was extremely responsive, easy to work with, and was able to provide us with what we needed within a very short time deadline. We could not be happier with our stationer or stationary, and have not stopped receiving compliments on our invitations. I highly recommend Gwen Marie and her shop and will definitely use her again in the future!

Our invitations were BEAUTIFUL! I am pretty laid back and did not provide A LOT of direction as to what we were looking for--basically, I said purple and "springy" and the design she came up with matched our theme and wedding personality perfectly! We received so many compliments on them--thanks Melissa! :)

I'm not sure why it's taken me so long to say how wonderful our experience was working with Confetti Creative! We are half-way across the country and never actually met Andrea in person; however, after some phone consultations and lots of email communication, Andrea produced a fabulous package of print materials that exceeded our expectations. She made it easy, was open to all feedback and crafted Save the Dates, Invitations, Thank You Cards, and Maps (of an area she didn't know) that were unique and memorable. I would highly recommend Andrea and look forward to the next opportunity to work with her again.

Phyllis and Shantel are wedding superheroes. They're able to piece together the various concepts you envision and somehow merge them into a cohesive backdrop for your celebration. From driving 90+miles to select the perfect greenery for our bouquets to overnighting our groomsmen's suit pieces to adjust for some "quarantine 15" action, they went above and beyond in every way. I can't say enough good things about them. These wedding superheroes are worth their weight in gold.

Alphagraphics was so easy to work with! I stopped by the store to explain what I was wanting and a price quote and they got back to me that same afternoon. They printed my invitations with ease and were so flexible to work with when we needed additional invitations. The quality was amazing and I received many compliments on our invitations!

Brandi is the BEST!!!!! Somehow from my super technical ideas of "beachy, watercolor, fun" she turned it into our dream design for the programs and thank you cards!! Lightning fast response and turnaround time. The design was flawless. She even gave us a couple different options to choose from. EXTREMELY easy to work with! If you want something unique, fun, modern, the list goes on, she is your gal! Brandi definitely has the creativity to think up any dream designs specifically catered to what YOU want! Love her, will be calling her again for our Holiday cards this winter.

It was really great working with Danielle at Autumn Fox on our stationery and day-of signage, even if it was only via email! Danielle's dedication to crafting a personalized experience shone through, and we were genuinely impressed. She went above and beyond by creating a stencil image of our beloved pet bunny, which adorned our envelopes and bar signage. In the end, the stationery and signage seamlessly integrated into our wedding theme, exceeding our expectations. Working with Danielle was a pleasure, and her attention to detail added a delightful touch to our celebration. We couldn't have been happier with the results!
