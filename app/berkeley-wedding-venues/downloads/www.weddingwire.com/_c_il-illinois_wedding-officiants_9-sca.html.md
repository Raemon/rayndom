Rev. Russ created a lovely ceremony—one that was profoundly moving, meaningful, and felt us all the way. From the moment he began speaking, everyone in the room was fully present. There was a perfect balance of warmth, sincerity, and gentle joy. What stood out most was how personal the ceremony felt. Rev. Russ took the time to really know our story and shared it with such care and grace. It felt authentic, intentional, and sacred in the best way. So many of our guests commented afterward on how touching the ceremony was and how it set the tone for the entire day. We are incredibly grateful to Rev. Russ for creating a moment we will cherish for the rest of our lives. Highly recommend to any couple looking for a heartfelt, meaningful ceremony.

We couldn’t have asked for a better reverend to lead our ceremony. Rev. Phil is different than any other. He guided us through each step, even planning from out of state. From our first meeting, we had full confidence that the day would be seamless. He had meaningful contributions to the script that highlighted things about us as a couple. He created a guide, and script that was shared with us incrementally before the big day. On top of his organization, he was lighthearted, friendly, and flexible. He remembered small things about us and created a warmth to our rehearsal and wedding day. From the very beginning, communication was seamless. He was always quick to reply, thoughtful, and incredibly easy to work with. From our first zoom call with him, we had full confidence that our ceremony would be perfect.

From the first call we had with Rev Bill we knew we had found the right officiant for us. We cannot express enough gratitude for making our wedding ceremony such a special experience. From the beginning, he took time to understand our story, our values and what mattered most to us. Conveying the essence of our journey together while also staying true to our religious background. The ceremony was heartfelt, beautifully written and delivered with such warmth that it felt deeply personal. Rev Bill went above and beyond to create a ceremony that reflects our love story and made our day just that more special.

Dave was wonderful as an officiant for our wedding. We wanted someone fun and someone to keep the guests entertained with a short and sweet ceremony. Dave did it all. He told a love story about us, kept the crowd engaged, and was very touching with his statements. We met with Dave a few times before our wedding. He is very organized, prompt, and a wonderful officiant. He also handled making sure the marriage certificates were delivered to the county fast. I recommend Rev. Dave to anyone!! Thank you again!!

Adam Jamsa was our officiant, and he played a pivotal role in making our wedding ceremony a heartfelt and meaningful experience. His warm, welcoming, and engaging presence immediately put us at ease and he crafted a ceremony that truly reflected our love story, after having several sessions to go over our background. Adam took time to understand our values and incorporated personal touches that made the ceremony uniquely ours. We are a nontraditional couple, and that was never an issue with Adam and he made us feel comfortable and important throughout the entire process. His eloquence and ability to capture the essence of our relationship left a lasting impression on both us and the guests. Guests asked even if we had known him already or if he was a family friend because he knew and captured so well who we were and our story. We are incredibly grateful to Adam for officiating our union with such grace and sincerity, and we wholeheartedly recommend his services to couples seeking a personalized and memorable wedding ceremony I had only ever been to weddings where it was someone's friend officiating for the couple, and moreso just as a utility, so didn't realize how powerful and beautiful having a professional wedding officiant would be. I would highly recommend to any couple to have a professional officiant, especially Adam Jamsa!

Pam is the best officiant we could have found for our wedding. She has amazing uplifting and positive energy which is exactly what is needed that day. We immediately felt she takes her work seriously and she worked with us one-on-one to curate a beautiful ceremony. She provided a lot of examples and texts, helped us edit and add new parts, and in the end delivered a ceremony that all of our guests will remember for ever. Everyone absolutely loved the moment. She helped us keep calm and relaxed during the ceremony, which was much appreciated. There is no way for anyone to not consider Pam, regardless of the type of ceremony you are looking to have. Thank you so much!

Denise was wonderful to work with! She guided us through the preparation of our ceremony, understood our vision and gave us great ideas. On the day of rehearsal and on our wedding day, Denise took charge and organized the wedding party effectively and efficiently. The ceremony was beautiful! She did such an amazing job! All of the guests commented on how beautiful the ceremony was and loved how she was able to incorporate meaningful traditions from both of our families. I would recommend Denise for your wedding!

We found Tom through The Knot, and his excellent reviews convinced us to set up a meeting. From the very first call, Tom was professional, warm, and genuinely funny. We immediately felt comfortable with him. Throughout the planning process, Tom was patient, organized, and incredibly diligent. With everything going on, it was hard for us to stay on top of every detail, and Tom consistently followed up to keep us on track—never pushy, always supportive. He made the entire process feel easy. Now for the most important part: the ceremony. Tom arrived exactly when he said he would, and even though we weren’t able to have a rehearsal due to venue constraints and scheduling challenges with family, he handled everything flawlessly. His delivery was heartfelt, thoughtful, and had the perfect touch of humor. We requested a completely non-religious ceremony, and he honored that fully—every word felt intentional and true to who we are. What truly set Tom apart, though, was the way he made us feel in the moment. When my bride walked in, I found myself overwhelmed and stuck in my own head. Tom made a few quiet, perfectly timed comments that brought me back into the present so I could truly experience that moment. That meant more to me than he’ll ever know. Tom is not only an excellent officiant but a genuinely kind and grounding presence. We couldn’t recommend him more highly. If you’re considering him—just book him. You’ll be grateful you did. Thank you for being such a meaningful part of our day. With gratitude, Mr. & Mrs. Pennington
