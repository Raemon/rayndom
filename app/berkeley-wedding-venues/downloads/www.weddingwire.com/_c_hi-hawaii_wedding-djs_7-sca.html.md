We had the pleasure to have CC as our amazing DJ for our wedding. Through each step of the process she was helpful and responsive to our needs. We had several unexpected delays and changes in the program and she was able to adjust and keep everything running smoothly. Everyone had a great time and partied on the dance floor until the very end. Could not have asked for a better time or DJ.

My husband I chose DJ James to be our DJ for our wedding at Paliku Gardens this June! We already felt confident about our choice early on, but it was immediately confirmed when we attended an event December 2024, that he happened to be DJing as well! We provided a guideline of the types of songs and styles of music we enjoy, but also wanted to give him the freedom to select some pieces based on the vibe of the crowd! He did a great job and everyone was extremely satisfied!!! We have received so many compliments from our guests on our choice of vendors and would definitely recommend DJ James to anyone on Oahu in need of an engaging, fun, and talented DJ! -Taylor & Andrew

From start to finish, Hunter was composed, professional, and totally in sync with the vibe we were going for. The music throughout the night was perfect — from cocktail hour to dancing, he kept the energy flowing and the dance floor full. But the true highlight? His photo booth! It was a massive hit with all our guests and created so many fun, unforgettable memories. We’re still laughing at some of the pictures! Thank you, Hunter, for being such a crucial part of our special day. You exceeded every expectation and we couldn’t be happier. Highly, highly recommend!

Nate is truly the best DJ you could ask for for your wedding! From start to finish, he was amazing to work with — very professional, easy to communicate with, and always responsive (he replied within 24 hours every time). The music was perfect. He read the room so well and had everyone dancing all night long. Our guests are still talking about how fun the dance floor was! Nate was also incredibly flexible, even with last-minute changes on the wedding day, which made everything completely stress-free. On top of that, he connected us with our saxophonist — who was absolutely incredible and took the party to the next level. If you’re looking for a DJ who delivers top-tier service, great energy, and unbeatable value, Nate and his team are it. Truly the best DJ for your wedding — we couldn’t recommend him enough!

DJ D-lyte (Dwight) did a great job as the MC/DJ on our wedding day. The music was great and the little special touches like the up-lights and projectors were great as well. All of our guests especially enjoyed the Photo Booth! If you need a DJ for your wedding who also provides basic MC services in addition to services which will enhance the vibe of your wedding we would definitely recommend DJ D-lyte!

We are so grateful we had Ed as our DJ for our wedding! From the very beginning, he was friendly, professional, and easy to work with. On the big day, he brought such an amazing energy and kept the flow of the evening running perfectly. He read the crowd so well, kept the dance floor packed all night, and also took care of all our lighting and set up the dance floor! The night wouldn’t have been the same without it all! Not only is he incredibly talented, but he’s also so kind and generous. He truly went above and beyond for us, and we’ll always remember how special he made our celebration feel. We would recommend Ed to anyone looking for a DJ who genuinely cares about making your day perfect. Thank you, Ed, for being such an important part of our special day!
