Ashley and Fog City Entertainment are AMAZING!

Ashley was amazing! Leading up to the wedding, she was super helpful in guiding us through the steps to set up playlists and coordinate the intros/outros of the bridal party. Our wedding was spread out over a large property, and she had zero issue running speakers to each area, providing a festive, cozy atmosphere! We had a couple live performances and she was very accommodating in getting mic stands and cables all ready to go. Then the DANCING began! Lights, speakers, the whole deal - Ashley killed it! We leaned into more 70’s and 80’s music, and Ashley completely understood the assignment. Needless to say, the music mix was brilliant. Since then, we have had at least a dozen of our friends and family tell us that this was the most fun they have ever had at a wedding. I have no doubt that Ashley is 99.99% responsible for that. Hiring Ashley and Fog City Entertainment made a lot of sense 6 months ago, but now, having seen what she can do for a wedding’s atmosphere and dance floor, it’s a no-brainer. Thank you, Ashley!!

Fog City Entertainment

We had an amazing experience working with Jose, our wedding DJ, and Ashley, the owner of the company. From start to finish, they were incredibly easy to work with, very responsive, and truly took the time to ask all the right questions to ensure our wedding vision came to life. Their professionalism and attention to detail gave us so much confidence going into the big day.  
Jose absolutely nailed the music—our guests loved the song choices, and the dance floor was packed all night long. Everyone had an incredible time dancing the night away, and we received so many compliments on the music. We couldn’t be happier with our experience and highly recommend Jose, Ashley, and their team to anyone looking for a fun, seamless, and unforgettable wedding celebration.

Fog City Entertainment brought our vision to life!

Fog City Entertainment, specifically DJ Ashley, was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding on November 22, 2025. From the very beginning, Ashley was incredibly hands-on — helping us plan, refine, and perfect every detail of the music and overall event flow.  
  
On the day itself, everything felt effortless. The transitions were smooth, the energy was perfect, and the entire program flowed seamlessly thanks to Ashley’s guidance and professionalism. Our guests had an amazing time, and we genuinely felt so taken care of throughout the entire experience.  
  
Highly, highly recommend Fog City Entertainment! Ashley brought our vision to life and made our celebration unforgettable.

Wedding with Fog City

My now wife and I had a fantastic experience with Fog City for our wedding. The team was organized, responsive, and genuinely invested in helping us create an unforgettable celebration. Their intake process for the event timeline and music preferences was impressively thorough and easy to use. It made planning seamless and stress-free.  
Ashley was fantastic in helping us stay on track leading up to the big day, and our DJ, Jose, brought the energy to the dance floor. He read the crowd well, adapted to last-minute timeline changes, and kept the flow of the evening smooth. The uplighting transformed our reception space beautifully, and the full-service photobooth was a huge hit with our guests. We were even sent a digital copy of all photobooth images following the wedding.  
We’d highly recommend Fog City to any couple looking for a professional, talented, and fun team to bring their wedding vision to life.

Loved DJ Dean from Fog City Entertainment

DJ Dean and his lovely CO-partner were an amazing duo and just so perfect for our wedding. They read the vibes, played great songs and even helped us coordinate karaoke! It was such a special night facilitated by the amazing DJ Dean and were super happy we went with Fog City Entertainment for our wedding. DJ Dean was so kind and took his time to do a pre-call with us just two weeks out and really seamlessly worked in the karaoke with the dancing to make really special moment for my husband and I. We loved it and we loved DJ Dean!

Our dance floor was lit!!!!

DJ for our wedding was DJ Jose. He was amazing, our dance floor was lit and our guests had a night!!!! We pretty much gave him free rein to play whatever he wanted apart from the important moments like introduction and cake cutting. He could adapt to multiple song requests given by our guests in multiple languages and blend it so well. Also Ashley was very easy to work with. We had some last minute changes and she was able to accommodate them.

FCE made our wedding a real celebration!

I could not be happier with our decision to have DJ Ashley as both MC and DJ at our wedding. From our first chat, she was responsive, thorough, and open to any and all ideas we had for the day and delivered on everything we asked for!  
  
Leading up to our wedding day she took extra care to check in to make sure the day went exactly as we wanted and she was aware of all our song requests and music preferences. She even took the time to visit the venue beforehand to make sure she was prepared to set up all the different areas needing sound and music (ceremony space, reception area, etc.) and placement for the photobooth.   
  
The day of, I was confident everything would go smoothly and as planned and I was correct! She handled the flow of all the functions seamlessly from guest entrance music, bridal procession, reception entrance, and speeches. When it came to dancing, she created a perfect mix of all our songs requested and included others that fit our vibe perfectly. It was really special to hear all the songs we love to dance and party to, surrounded with all our friends and family and seeing everyone having a great time. The energy she created not only on the dance floor but throughout the venue for all guests was amazing!  
  
Many of our guests told us personally how impressed they were with her, and I couldn’t agree more.

Great time!

We knew immediately we wanted to hire FCE for our music! Ashley was so friendly and professional, and I'm sure would be worth the premium upgrade, however she was booked on our date and we had a total blast with DJ Jose! It was easy to share our music selections and they did a great job blending in Persian music throughout the night!

Peace of Mind & Fun with Fog City!

DJ Dan and Fog City Entertainment were amazing to work with and helped bring the party at our wedding!! From the outset, FCE was easy to work with - they were among the most communicative in the planning process, answering all of our questions promptly and thoroughly. That was great, as we've never hired a DJ before and had LOTS of questions. It made the decision to hire FCE really easy.  
  
Top notch communication continued in the weeks leading up to our wedding. We wanted to include my cousin, who is a musician, in the ceremony music, and he was able to communicate directly with DJ Dan who made it really seamless to include him.   
  
At the wedding itself, DJ Dan was flexible and rolled with any changes (aka delays) to the timeline, and was responsive to our requests. And he had the dance floor bumping, which was our hope!! I knew my friends would dance, but wasn't sure about my husband's friends or some of our family. I told Dan that my goal was to have all generations on the dance floor, and he made it happen - right up to the end of the evening! We even decided to pay overtime and go past our original end time because the party was still hopping at 10 pm, thanks to Dan!  
  
Overall, DJ Dan and FCE met every expectation we had and just made the whole process easy, which is such a blessing during wedding planning - there are so many details to keep track of; it was great to feel like we were in safe hands and didn't have to worry on the music front. Plus, they made it fun! I highly recommend.
