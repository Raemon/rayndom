Montfair Resort Farm was the perfect choice for our outdoorsy fall wedding. Victoria offered invaluable advice in the build-up to our wedding, whilst the rest of the team helped to create a super friendly and warm environment for our friends and family over the weekend’s celebrations. With a lot of family travelling from overseas, the on-site cabins helped us to create a cosy and warm atmosphere in the days leading up to our wedding, and we loved being able to utilise the different spaces the venue has to offer from the Lake, fields, and lodge. When the weather didn’t play according to plan on our big day, Montfair’s staff flawlessly executed our rain-plan, which surpassed all expectations and allowed for an intimate ceremony, still surrounded by the beautiful nature of Montfair. We can’t recommend Montfair enough!

Historic Jasmine won me over years before my engagement. As a wedding vendor myself, I fell in love with the charm of the grounds and the ease of working with the Smith family. I could not imagine my wedding day anywhere else! My husband fell in love with the venue the moment we turned down the long driveway. The venue has a great deal of character and a cozy ambiance. The owners go above and beyond to assist their clients and the wedding vendors on site. We highly recommend Historic Jasmine!

Wow, this venue truly outdid themselves! Not only did I get my absolute dream wedding, but the owners were incredibly kind, attentive, and genuinely helpful every step of the way. They went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly and that we felt supported throughout the entire process. On top of that, the pricing was very affordable for everything that was included, which made the experience even better. I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect place to celebrate such a special day and would highly recommend this venue to anyone planning their wedding or event.

Amber Grove is an incredible wedding venue that is staffed with incredible people! John and Kristina were wonderful in making sure every aspect of our wedding from the first venue tour to the last minute of our reception went smoothly. We did not have to worry about a single thing and any questions we had they always had a response. They clearly care so much about the couples they have at their venue- down to providing us a gift at the end of the wedding along with leftovers for the next day! We had so many compliments from people about the venue and how they wish they had heard of Amber Grove for their wedding. On top of everything that John and Kristina did for us, the chef was just as amazing. He spent time talking to friends and family at the rehearsal dinner, provided coffee to us the morning of the wedding, and delivered incredible plate after incredible plate. We would recommend this wedding venue to everyone.

The Barn at Kline’s Mill is an amazing venue for whatever your needs are. The owner (Kay) and her staff are amazing. The venue is beautiful! The grounds surrounding the barn are just amazing. My daughter’s wedding was the middle of October. The weather was absolutely perfect! Thank you for putting in the “perfect weather” request! The venue is surrounded by farm land. The farmers were baling hay but unless you were a farmer (we are) you’d never know what was going on. The Air BnB on property was exquisite, intriguing and awe inspiring. I kept saying “ if you can’t find it in this kitchen/house, it doesn’t exist!” The Farm house is right next to the venue and would HIGHLY recommend renting it in conjunction with the venue. Super convenient!! Kay is right onsite if you need anything at all! The other Air BnB is a short walk from the Farm house and just as convenient and lovely! I CANNOT say enough good/great things about this venue! Highly recommend for a wedding, family reunion, whatever your small or large event needs.

From our first visit to Big Spring with Buddy we knew this was the perfect place for our wedding! Emma has excellent communication throughout our planning process and helped our coordinators plan our day beautifully. We had our ceremony on the hilltop, reception on the veranda and in the barn, and added the ATV and mountaintop experience to our package and I would not have changed a thing! The team was very thorough in our final walk through to make sure we had a detailed rain plan, ensured we had all inventory items needed, and created a layout to get the best use of this beautiful space. The mountain top experience is a must for portraits and was a great place to have some time together before joining our guests in the reception. Thank you to BSF!

Winning a $25k wedding at Fairview Farm Events has truly been one of the biggest blessings for Nicholas and me. Planning a wedding can be overwhelming, and we were starting to feel the weight of the financial stress. When we found out we had won, it felt like a miracle. We are so grateful to have our wedding fully covered, and it has brought us so much joy and peace knowing we can now focus on celebrating our love and preparing for our future together. Fairview Farm Events has been incredible from the very beginning. Their generosity and the way they honor military families is something we will always remember. The venue is absolutely beautiful, and we are thrilled to be able to get married in a place we never could have afforded on our own. We want everyone to know how thankful we are and how special this opportunity is. Fairview Farm Events has truly given us a gift that will stay with us forever.

Mount Ida Barn was a beautiful setting for an outdoor/indoor wedding. Everyone I dealt with at Mount Ida from start to finish was extremely professional and I would highly recommend this venue. It is very reasonably priced and the grounds looked beautiful for the outdoor ceremony and the barn is beautiful and big for a nice sized reception. We were so happy we picked this venue!
