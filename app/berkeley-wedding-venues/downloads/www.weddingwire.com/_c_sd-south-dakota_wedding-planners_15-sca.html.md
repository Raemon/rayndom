Loghin was AMAZING! Our wedding was in Mexico and we heard great reviews about her so we reached out and it was by far the best decision ever made. She started helping about 3 months prior with our package we chose and helped with ideas of decor, spacing, timing, etc. She then came to Mexico with us and worked with my vendors to figure out timing, placement, etc. and was very patient with the language barrier. She made it extremely stress free prior to the wedding as well as the wedding weekend. She helped with the littles things you forget about as well like sending people down the aisle on time, and getting everyone to cocktail hour directly as well as bringing everyone in for the reception. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE AND ANYONE!!!!!!!

Our venue (5 Family Ranch) recommended Hitch Studio and I'm so glad! Natalie at Hitch Studio walked us through the entire wedding planning process. Our check in meetings up until the wedding were so helpful to make sure everything was on track. She answered my questions as they came up and talked through any additions or changes that came up along the way. Having her assist with our decor and day of timeline was so worth it! Since the decor set-up and take down was covered, that made the day a breeze. One less stress! She helped bring my wedding decor vision to life! Having the day of timeline also helped with the ease of the day, all the vendors and family/friends knew where to be and when. Natalie helped with all the behind the scenes details which made the day run seamlessly. Our day was perfect! Myself and the groom as well as our parents could be fully present in the day knowing all the details were covered. I would highly recommend working with Hitch Studio for wedding planning, decor and a day of timeline, your day is guaranteed to be beautiful and worry-free! Warmly, The Waceks

Jennifer with Plan to Party was incredibly professional and exceeded expectations from start to finish. We booked her for coordination of our special day as we neared closer to the date. She helped us tie up the loose ends and take away all the final stressors. My now-husband and I were so relaxed and chill on our wedding day because we knew everything was organized and executed professionally with finesse. In hindsight, I can’t imagine having gotten through the day so seamlessly without her! Highly recommend
