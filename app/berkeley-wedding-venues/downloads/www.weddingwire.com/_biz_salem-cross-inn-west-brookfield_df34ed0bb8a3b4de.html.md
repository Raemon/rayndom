Rustic, charming and unforgettable!!

Billy and I got married 10/15/23. The Salem Cross Inn speaks for itself. Old, rustic, charming and cozy. The grounds are absolutely beautiful! The barn is breathtaking. We cannot put into words how amazing the staff is. From the moment we walked in for the first time, peeked into the barn and then met Donna, we knew it was perfect. She was so welcoming, great to work with and made everything so easy for us. The food is amazing and from scratch. Our wedding guests were truly blown away and cannot stop talking about it. We are so thankful to have our wedding here at this amazing, historical venue. We will be returning often to enjoy a wonderful meal along with the taking in the scenery. Jennifer and Billy

The best place to have a beautiful barn wedding 

I'm not sure where to start. We got married 9/19/25 at Salem Cross inn. And it was just amazing! We chose Salem Cross for multiple reasons. One of the biggest, especially when it comes to a wedding, the cost and the food! No price gouging on particular days of the week or time of the year! Was very well priced, and the food! Omg!!! The food is ALL amazing!!! The hourderves were incredible! The entrees as well. We knew the food was going to be amazing as we attended a fire place feast (highly recommend those as well!!!). They are a restaurant, so the quality of food and the taste is extremely important to the venue as it is to you and your guest! Also we wanted a barn wedding. And Salem Cross is an actual, original barn. Not just a new barn someone built as a venue because it's trendy. They've been in business for years!! Actually during the fireplace feast we sat with a couple that had been married there at the barn 30yrs prior!! Nancy and Donna who run Salem Cross are incredible ladies!!! So helpful, quick responses, always accommodating to anything we needed or wanted to do! Everyone of our guests LOVED the venue, the food, the cake, everything!!! They also have a preferred vendor list that came in very handy. We used Kristin Woodis for our justice of the peace/ceremony coordinator and she was also fantastic to work with and very easy to work with!

Best choice we made!

Choosing the Salem Cross Inn was one of the easiest - and best decisions we made for our wedding! From the moment we first visited, Nancy made us feel so welcome and informed. You could instantly sense the passion she and her family have for their food, the restaurant, and every event they host.  
  
We were lucky enough to get our preferred date, and from that point on, planning with the venue was seamless. Nancy and Donna were always just an email or call away, responding quickly and thoroughly to any question we had. Our final planning meeting with them was incredibly helpful—they offered thoughtful suggestions about seating and overall setup that made the day flow perfectly.  
  
The pricing was straightforward and reasonable, especially considering the incredible quality of the experience. So many guests told us it was the best prime rib they’ve ever had—not just at a wedding, but anywhere! Watching it cook in the fireplace added such a unique and memorable touch. From our initial tasting to the night of the wedding, every dish was absolutely delicious.  
  
The venue itself is stunning. We were lucky with the weather (75 and sunny in April!) so we held our ceremony outside, followed by dinner and formalities in the barn, and then dancing downstairs in the cozy fireplace room. It was perfect. Every staff member we interacted with was kind, helpful, and genuinely seemed happy to be part of our day.  
  
We truly couldn’t have imagined our wedding anywhere else. Salem Cross Inn made our day magical, and we can’t wait to come back and visit again!

Even Better Than We Dreamed Of!

Our wedding at Salem Cross Inn was even better than we dreamed it could be. Everyone at Salem Cross was extremely helpful, from Nancy and Donna, who helped us plan leading up to the wedding day, to the bartenders and waitstaff, who helped make the day feel extra special. (The bartenders took some videos of the wedding day, unprompted, and sent them to us after!)  
Salem Cross's list of recommended vendors made planning the wedding so easy, and everyone they recommended was fabulous.  
Our guests keep raving about Salem Cross, too. Everyone agrees that it's the only wedding they've ever been to where seconds were served at dinner!  
Salem Cross is so magical, from the fields and cows at the back to the barn and indoor ceremony area. We had to pivot at the last minute to having our ceremony indoors, and not only did Nancy and Donna make the last-minute change a breeze, but our ceremony ended up being even more amazing than we'd imagined, especially thanks to the fairy lights and the fire crackling in the background with prime rib roasting.  
We highly recommend Salem Cross and all the people they work with!

From start to finish Donna, Nancy and Martha walked us through every detail and left nothing to chance. They were professional, yet very personable to the familial areas that made our day meaningful and beautiful. They become an extension to a memorable day.

Incredible Experience!

My husband and I got married at the Salem Cross Inn in June 2023 and we had a great experience! Donna and Nancy were extremely attentive and helpful with the planning process. We had several phone calls and in-person meetings with them leading up to the day and they always made time for us. I loved being able to get ready in the bridal suite, it was a perfect space to relax and get ready with my bridesmaids before the ceremony. It ended up raining on our wedding day so we got to utilize the downstairs area and it was so cozy with the fire going and the lights on the ceiling. Our guests loved the food - we have received several compliments about the strawberry shortcake and the prime rib. We loved the vibe of the venue and the quality of the experience. I highly recommend the Salem Cross Inn for any event, it is a wonderful backdrop for photos!

Intimate Wedding Venue

I've been going to dinners at the Salem Cross Inn throughout my life and I decided to have my wedding here June 2nd 2023. Donna & Nancy were really helpful and attentive leading up to the day! They are very patient and organized.   
If you're looking for a barn style wedding that's more upscale, this is the place! The space itself is perefect if you love an old school, classic New England look. The outdoor space has an amazing backdrop of pastures for great photo ops with the wedding party.   
The food was very good (it always is here). Spring for the fire roasted prime rib if that's your thing, your guests might even see it turning over the hearth in the basement. Can't recommend Salem Cross enough.

intimate Christmas Wedding

With only having 32 guests, we had our wedding in the Brookfield room, it was a perfect room. Nancy and Donna were amazing, they guided us from the very beginning until the very end with every detail, it didn't matter that it was a small wedding. I appreciate everything they did for us. Our guests are still raving out the food and venue.
