See's provided a beautiful box of four chocolate candies in an individually packaged box for each guest. The white box with gold lettering worked perfectly with our decor and was just the right size to put a tent-folded card on top of each box with a message to our guests. The Lynnwood store even let me place my order with them and have it shipped with on of their regular shipments and saved me shipping charges altogether...especially great with warm-weather shipping charges from the online source!

Destiny and Paul (the owners) are probably 2 of the nicest and sweetest people I have ever met. We have been eating The Confectional's cheesecakes for many years as we go to Pike Place Market where they are located quite a bit, and have been to other events in which they have been served (including my sisters wedding 4 years ago) When we went in for our tasting Destiny was beyond amazing, she had our 6 flavors all ready for us and walked us through each one telling us about the ingredients that they use, which are all top quality and also that they also use other local vendors for some of the elements that go into the cheesecakes! For our actual wedding day we chose 3 of their regular flavors and then they also created a special flavor for us, a Lemon Passion Fruit since we love Hawaii and it was AMAZING. I can not recommend enough getting your wedding cake from them, not only is is a unique choice, but it is DELICIOUS and the left overs are easy to store since they are individual cakes so you can freeze them and just take out a few at a time!

We are athletes and used Five Ultimate to create reversible basketball jerseys as our favors. These were one of the biggest hits of the wedding - as we entered the reception, everyone, including grandparents, had these hot items on over their dress clothes! Five has lots of talented clothing designers and suppliers at their fingertips and were able to help us create our perfect, personalized favors with our family name on the back of the jersey on either side and my picture/name on the front of one side and my husband's picture/name on the front of the other side. It was the perfect mix of casual fun and classy craftsmanship that I have grown accustomed to working with Five. Awesome!

I bought two sets of wine glasses for my two sisters and they absolutely loved them. They have since then showed them to other family and friends at candle parties and other various events. I highly recommend this business to anyone.
