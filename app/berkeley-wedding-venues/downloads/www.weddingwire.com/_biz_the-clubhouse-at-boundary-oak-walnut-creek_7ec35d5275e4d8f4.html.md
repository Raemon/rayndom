Great Place for a High School Reunion

We had our 60th High School Reunion at Boundary Oak with a total of 94 guests. The whole evening was amazing. We had the Mira Vista Bar Room plus the vista Room and the adjoining balcony was also ours. Everyone just loved the view, the dinner, the whole setup. The staff was so great, courteous, professional, thoughtful and wonderful! We ended up with 4 additional guests and the staff immediately brought in 2 smaller tables to accommodate us without any problem. Thank you, Angelique, for taking such care of us during the past 6 months. It was a pleasurable experience and I expect to be here at our 70th reunion.

The Dream Venue for a Serial Bridesmaid 

I recently hosted my third bridal shower at Boundary Oak, and once again, it was absolutely flawless.   
  
At this point, I’ve become something of a serial matron of honor (dear lord, no more... I say that every time), and each time I’m tasked with planning a shower, I know exactly where to go.  
Boundary Oak has become my go-to for a reason. The venue is beautiful, the setting is perfect, and most importantly, the team is truly exceptional.   
  
Angelique and the staff are incredibly professional, responsive, and thoughtful in every step of the process. They make planning easy, even when you’re juggling a hundred other wedding-related tasks.  
  
The space is bright, elegant, and adaptable for any vibe you're going for, and the views never fail to impress. The food is always a hit: fresh, well-presented, and something guests actually talk about afterward. And the staff during the event is just as amazing as the planning team: attentive, friendly, and on top of everything without being overbearing.  
  
After three showers here, I can confidently say that much of the praise I get for these events really belongs to Boundary Oak. They consistently deliver a smooth, high-quality experience that makes me look like I know exactly what I’m doing, even when I’m just trying to survive another round of bridal duties.  
  
If you're planning a bridal shower (or any celebration, really), I can’t recommend them enough. I’ll be back again... though hopefully as just a guest next time.

Perfect Venue

My son and daughter in law were married at Boundary Oak in July 2025. From the beginning, we knew we had selected the perfect venue. Not only was the venue a beautiful location, Angelique was amazing in assisting us with every aspect of coordinating the event. Throughout the process, she handled all of our questions and was quick to handle any issues that arose. The food was outstanding, much better than we anticipated, and we received many compliments from the guests. The facility offered a beautiful area for a cocktail reception following a ceremony overlooking the greenery of the golf course. The attention to detail in every aspect was amazing. Overall, the entire staff staff was attentive and pleasant, providing excellent customer service. The ability to work with their preferred vendors, from the DJ, florist, etc. made the coordination of the event so easy. Pricing was reasonable and flexible. We couldn't have been happier with the level of service, quality of food and the customer service provided.

The clubhouse at Boundary Oak 

I was looking for an affordable but nice venue to have my wedding reception and after looking at a few different places I came across Boundary Oak golf course. The grounds are beautiful and the interior space is gorgeous as well. The food is first rate and Melissa the co-ordinator is amazing. She kept me informed of anything that came up she ran me through the different looks that people had used including colors setups and lighting. I would recommend this venue to anyone who wants to have there wedding at beautiful and well organized venue. Actually I did and one of my friends had her wedding there just a few weeks after mine, and she loved it.

Great Venue & Coordinator!

We chose the Clubhouse at Boundary Oak as our wedding & reception venue and got married on January 11, 2020. I just want to say that Lilly is an amazing coordinator and we really enjoyed working with her. Since both my husband and I were one of the first ones to get married among our friends, we weren't super familiar with this whole wedding planning process. Lilly offered us so much guidance and tips which made our planning much easier. Lilly was very attentive to detail, accommodating to our needs, and made sure things went smoothly on the day of our wedding.   
  
Just a few days before the wedding, I had a last minute question for Lilly, but because it was New Year's Eve, I wasn't really expecting a reply from her right away. But she did on the very next day, on January 1st! This says something about her work ethic and how much she cares about her clients.. :)   
  
Overall, we were very satisfied with Boundary Oak and would definitely recommend Lilly as a wedding coordinator!

We recently got married at the Clubhouse at Boundary Oak in October of 2017. I cannot say enough about how much my husband and I loved both the venue and the staff! We had our ceremony at the lakeside ceremony site, our cocktail hour in the Mira Vista room, and our reception in the Celebration room. Every staff member that I interacted with was friendly, efficient, and helpful. The Catering director was responsive during our initial contract discussions, and worked with me to fit everything into our budget, even before we signed the dotted line! Their packages are extremely reasonable based on my research, especially on Friday or Sunday. The tables, basic chairs, linens and napkins, staff (including day of coordination), food, set up and break down are all included, not to mention FLOOR LENGTH linens as the default! They offer lots of luxe upgrades if you want them, but we actually went with the Gold package, and our only upgrade was to buffet instead of plated and everything was gorgeous! We did end up scoring a few upgrades for free though :) We worked closely with Charlene, our onsite and day of coordinator, and she was extremely responsive and very flexible and helpful! She worked with us on every detail, and had great suggestions for keeping things in our budget, while still getting everything we wanted! The day went off without a hitch, and we could not have been happier with how everything came together! If you have a modest budget and big wedding dreams, I whole-heartedly recommend Boundary Oak!

The Clubhouse at Boundary Oak is wonderful venue. A lot of space with a natural progression from ceremony area to cocktail area to reception area. All areas are separate so that the Guest do not see the Magical work done in the reception room until dinner. One of my favorite venues to work at.

As a vendor who has worked with The Clubhouse at Boundary Oak, I have had the privilege of helping brides with their stationery and every bride has expressed how much they just LOVE how easy and stress-FREE The Clubhouse at Boundary Oak has made their wedding planning process. In addition to the grounds being so beautiful and so GREEN, the views and "out-of-the-city" feel makes every bride feel like the "Whole World" is theirs for the day! Recommending The Clubhouse at Boundary Oak is a "no brainer" in my book!
