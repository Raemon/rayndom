Working with Emi Ink was a wonderful experience. We were luckily able to set up a consult with her at a cafe; which at the time she brought her designs that were available; it was really nice to be able to physically touch and see the designs and paper selection. Which as compared to other online companies we were thinking of using. More than likely, we would not have been able to do the same without buying samples to review before we made our final order. Stacey helped us from start to finish with helping us narrow down our design, font style, and even making a mock preview to review before finalizing. She is a very easy to work with vendor as well as very friendly. Any questions we may have had along the way, she was always quick to respond back via email. When making payments, it was so simple, no loops to run through or having to schedule meet ups to make a payment; it was all done online. Her completed work of our wedding suite was perfect! It was everything we(I) had hoped for, she was even able to customize the color scheme to match with our wedding colors. Her prices for designing and producing orders, are very comparable with other online retailers as well as other local vendors. We will certainly refer other couples to her for their wedding suites.

This vendor helped design my wedding invitations. We initially met in person and discussed the concept and colors of the wedding invitations. After the initial meeting she drafted up some sample wording with various designs to choose from and sent it to me via email. After finalizing the design, a sample was printed and mailed to me. After finalizing the draft the order was completed within a few days. The invitations are printed and made locally. The turn around time from the time I "OK" the final draft to picking up the invitations was less then a week. I had received many compliments on how lovely the invitations looked from my friends and family.

Bradley & Lily Stationery did my wedding invitations and I couldn't have asked for anything better. Stacey and Ian were great to work with and were so helpful in planning the design of my invites. They were also incredibly fast considering how much of the work had to be done by hand! B&L has an amazing portfolio of work (you can preview it on their website but seeing it in person is even better!) The invitations were elegant and simple enough but still portrayed the semi-formal beach theme I was going for. My invites were done in letterpress (amazing) but the other pieces (map, rsvp card) were just printed regularly. The paper is such nice quality and WAY different than a lot of those online wedding invitation vendors. (Be sure to order samples of the online invite if you are even considering buying them. I went through dozens of samples before I gave up ordering online.) In the end it's so much better to work with someone locally where you can actually touch the paper and know the quality of what you're getting. Stacey also hooked me up with a great calligrapher who did the addresses on the outer envelopes for me. Be sure to ask her for recommendations! I received so many compliments from guests on our invites and I would recommend Bradley & Lily to everyone for weddings or birthday parties or anything else you need beautiful stationery for.

I received a lot of compliments on how beautiful my invitations were and I must agree! Merriam worked with the colors I wanted and incorporated them into the design she had already created. Everything turned out the way I wanted. She was easy to work with and created whatever you wanted..fonts, designs, colors:)
