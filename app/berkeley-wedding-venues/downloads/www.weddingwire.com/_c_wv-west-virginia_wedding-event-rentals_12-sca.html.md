We were so so grateful to book W Rentals & Events for our Summer 2023 wedding. They were kind, communicative, and executed our vision perfectly. We rented their stunning plates, vintage glassware, gold flatware, wooden chairs, and ivory wooden sideboard. They were willing and able to travel with the rentals and were quick and efficient with loading and unloading equipment. We would highly recommend W Rentals for all of your wedding rental needs!
