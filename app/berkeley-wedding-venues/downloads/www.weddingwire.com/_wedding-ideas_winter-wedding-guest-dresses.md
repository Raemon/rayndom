### 3\. Statement mini

It's winter, which means jewel tones are once again the stars of the show. A dramatic surplice skirt and an asymmetrical one-shoulder neckline make this 'fit equal parts glamorous and sexy. This winter wedding cocktail dress reminds us of incredibly luxe gift wrap, making you the [best wedding gift](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-gifts-for-the-couple-who-has-everything) _and_ the best-dressed guest. 

**Simkhai** Cameron dress, $545, [REVOLVE](https://www.revolve.com/simkhai-cameron-dress-in-plum/dp/JSKI-WD282/)

### 4\. Beautiful burgundy

In the winter season, both shades of red and jewel tones are a fitting choice.

If you're on the hunt for a plus-size winter wedding guest dress, this could be the one.

**City Chic** Sassy dress in Ruby, $150, [Nordstrom](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/city-chic-sassy-dress-plus-size/6575644)

### 5\. Metallic maxi

Did someone say gold sequins? We _love_ an allover sparkle moment, and this charming designer dress gives all of that and more. The metallic gold hue is especially fit for a [New Year's Eve wedding](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/why-your-wedding-will-be-better-than-new-years-eve) (but really, it'll work throughout the holiday season). Thanks to the streamlined silhouette, it's just as fitting for a cocktail wedding as it is for a formal affair. 

**Reformation** Bevelyn dress, $328, [Reformation](https://www.thereformation.com/products/bevelyn-dress/1313990RGL.html)

### 6\. Formal maxi

If the invitation calls for black tie attire, your safest bet is to choose a full-length dress. Materials like velvet and satin are considered appropriate for formal events (plus, they fit the season really well). This deep purple maxi dress is exactly the kind of regal hue winter is known for.

**Chi Chi London** plus size cowl neck satin slip maxi dress in Purple, $202, [Chi Chi London](https://chichilondon.pxf.io/rnYQ6v)

### 7\. Electric blue

This otherwise streamlined wedding guest dress lets the bold blue color do all the talking. Wondering how to complete the look? Strapless dresses look stunning with a faux fur wrap or delicate pashmina. 

**Amanda Uprichard X Revolve** Shiran strapless midi dress in Lapis, $189, [REVOLVE](https://www.revolve.com/amanda-uprichard-x-revolve-shiran-strapless-midi-dress-in-lapis/dp/AMAN-WD1887/)

### 8\. Ombré effect

Here's another suitably sparkly outfit for a wedding that's taking place around Christmas or New Year's Eve. The puff sleeves add a playful element to this elevated attire. Bronze turns to black in an eye-catching ombré moment that you can guarantee you'll get complimented on. 

**Trina Turk** Asandra jumpsuit, from $69 to rent, [Rent the Runway](https://www.renttherunway.com/shop/designers/trina_turk/asandra_jumpsuit)

### 9\. Minimalist maxi

You can never go wrong with a simple-but-chic crepe dress, especially if you choose a color that salutes the holiday season. Add a touch of glam to this elegant outfit with a pair of heeled pumps and some bling. 

**Birdy Grey** Ash curve crepe dress, $99, [Birdy Grey](https://www.birdygrey.com/products/ash-crepe-dress-curve-emerald)

### 10\. Sultry slip

When it comes to [what _not_ to wear to a wedding](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/colors-you-cant-wear-to-a-wedding), many guests get the wrong idea about the color black. In most cases, it's totally fine to wear black to a wedding, especially in the winter when darker hues are trending. This versatile midi dress has a slip silhouette and cowl neckline. Dress it up with a pair of strappy heels and some statement earrings for a cocktail wedding.

**Anaphe** silhouette silk cowl slip dress, $252, [Anaphe](https://www.anaphe.com/en-us/collections/silk-dresses/products/silhouette-silk-cowl-slip-dress-classic-black)

### 11\. Floral velvet

We don't know about you, but this combination of teal velvet and dark florals checks all of our boxes. The V-neckline provides an opportunity to show off a nice necklace. 

**Lulus** Evenings With You dark teal floral velvet asymmetrical dress, $69, [Lulus](https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-11575-88550-157915?sid=WWeditorial&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lulus.com%2Fproducts%2Fevenings-with-you-dark-teal-floral-velvet-asymmetrical-dress%2F1554316.html)

### 12\. Eye-catching color

While powdery mauve and blush tones are arguably more suited for the spring, you can totally wear pink to a winter wedding if you want to. The trick is to choose a shade that fits the season, such as fuchsia or magenta. Pair this hot pink satin dress with a faux fur wrap or leather jacket to combat the cold weather. Barbie would totally approve. 

**ASTR The Label** Gaia dress in Bright Fuchsia, $98, [REVOLVE](https://www.revolve.com/astr-the-label-gaia-dress-in-bright-fuchsia/dp/ASTR-WD415/)

### 13\. Sleek jumpsuit

A jumpsuit is an excellent (read: warm) winter wedding outfit idea, especially if part of the celebration is taking place outdoors. The sleek material, wide-leg silhouette, and high neckline give this jumpsuit an especially formal feel. Since it's sleeveless, we recommend pairing it with a cute bolero to keep out the chill.

**Norma Kamali** sleeveless jumpsuit, $125, [REVOLVE](https://www.revolve.com/norma-kamali-sleeveless-jumpsuit-in-black/dp/NKAM-WR32/)

### 14\. Asymmetrical one-shoulder

The dainty florals on this one-shoulder dress remind us of budding blooms, while the dark black background keeps it rooted in the winter months. It's an excellent wedding guest dress for late February or early March when the lines between winter and spring are blurred. 

**Amur** asymmetric one-shoulder dress, from $70 to rent, [Rent the Runway](https://www.renttherunway.com/shop/designers/amur/asymmetric_one_shoulder_dress?lens=membership)

### 15\. Ruffled tiers

Shades of blue are also popular during the winter, from deep midnight hues all the way to light icy tones. This navy winter wedding guest dress has a plunging neckline and romantic tiered skirt.

**Lulus** Celebration Time navy blue sleeveless tiered midi dress, $86, [Lulus](https://www.lulus.com/products/celebration-time-navy-blue-sleeveless-tiered-midi-dress/1440256.html)

### 16\. Column silhouette

If you've been invited to a black tie wedding, it might be time to invest in an elegant gown you can wear again at future formal events. Everything about this column dress is perfect for winter, from the dark green hue and satin material to the elegant off-the-shoulder style. 

**Amsale** Pryce off-the-shoulder column dress, $495, [Anthropologie](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=39789&u1=WWeditorial&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropologie.com%2Fshop%2Fbhldn-pryce-off-the-shoulder-column-dress2)

### 17\. Feather trim

We can imagine Mrs. Claus herself in this magenta cocktail dress. The dark hue and velvet material feel delightfully festive, while the feather trim adds a lavish touch. It's easily one of the most Christmas-worthy wedding guest dresses we've seen.

**Adrianna Papell** long sleeve velvet tuxedo dress with feather hem in Magenta, $295, [Adrianna Papell](https://www.adriannapapell.com/products/long-sleeve-velvet-tuxedo-dress-with-feather-hem-in-magenta-mn1e208384)

### 18\. Lovely lilac

If you're looking for a dress to wear as a guest to a wedding in February, you might want to move beyond festive reds, greens, and metallics. This dusty lilac dress is a beautiful transitional piece that doesn't feel overly spring-y thanks to its darker-than-usual hue. 

**ASTR The Label** Sadyra dress in Mauve, $138, [REVOLVE](https://www.revolve.com/astr-the-label-sadyra-dress-in-mauve/dp/ASTR-WD446/)

### 19\. Put-together pantsuit

There's no denying that dark green is a festive hue—after all, it's the color of Christmas trees. With that in mind, it's a great color to go with if you're looking for an outfit to wear as a guest at a December wedding. This pantsuit offers plenty of coverage from cold weather, but the plunging neckline can still show off a little skin. It's a daring spin on a sophisticated ensemble.

**Banana Republic** Isa Italian Satin Blazer in Dark Juniper Green, $280, [Banana Republic](https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=821209012&rrec=true&mlink=5050,12413545,brproduct1_rr_1&clink=12413545#pdp-page-content); **Banana Republic** Isa Pleated Italian Satin Pant in Dark Juniper Green, $170, [Banana Republic](https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=820538002#pdp-page-content)

### 20\. Casual mini

If you're attending a winter wedding with a casual dress code, this sweet velvet mini will do the trick. This chic design will be a versatile addition to your wardrobe even after the nuptials. It comes in a range of inclusive sizes, including petite and plus-size options. 

**Anthropologie** The Somerset Mini Dress: Velvet Edition, $168, [Anthropologie](https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/the-somerset-mini-dress-velvet-edition2)

### 21\. Semi-formal sheath

For a semi-formal dress code, you want a winter wedding guest outfit that's less glitz-and-glam and more subtle-and-sophisticated. This sheath dress gets it right. The high neckline, long sleeves, and knee-length skirt feel modest but not overly formal. A silver sequin trim around the cuffs adds subtle sparkle. Pair it with silver jewelry to match. 

**Connected** boat neck sheer sleeve sheath dress, $79, [Macy's](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/connected-boat-neck-sheer-sleeve-sheath-dress?ID=12615833)

### 22\. Winter romance

Who said romantic, whimsical styles can't rule the colder months of the year? Don't feel confined to sultry silhouettes if that's not your vibe. The combination of an icy blue hue with flirty feminine details makes this dress another great option for late winter and early spring. 

**Hello Molly** Sky Child steel blue maxi dress, $82, [Hello Molly](https://www.hellomolly.com/collections/dresses/products/sky-child-maxi-dress-steel-blue)

### 23\. Winter florals

Dark shades of green like emerald and forest are popular throughout fall and winter. But if that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, there are ways to brighten it up without going off-theme. Exhibit A: This long, dark green dress with a fun floral print. Flowers in white and light green add plenty of life to this winter-friendly look. A slim fit and high slit provide plenty of opportunities to show off your figure. 

**Reformation** Twilight dress Es, $278, [Reformation](https://www.thereformation.com/products/twilight-dress-es/1309308PRT.html)

### 24\. Dramatic maxi

Looking for a showstopper? Consider it found. This long dress for a winter wedding guest falls dramatically and elegantly from the high neckline all the way to the ankle-length hem. The short sleeves are perfect for a destination that's a little warmer (and for adding a sparkly bracelet or two).

**Banana Republic** Aurelia crepe & satin maxi dress, $180, [Banana Republic](https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=755269042&cid=69883&pcid=69883&vid=1&nav=meganav%3AWomen%3AWomen%27s+Clothing%3ADresses+%26+Jumpsuits&cpos=6&cexp=2252&kcid=CategoryIDs%3D69883&cvar=17249&ctype=Listing&cpid=res23112015395486762000008#pdp-page-content)

### 25\. Berry red

Red is another color that can sometimes feel a little too daring to wear to a wedding, especially if it's an extra-vibrant hue. But if there's one time of year you can most definitely pull it off, it's the holidays. This strapless jumpsuit will help spread seasonal cheer at a Christmas wedding.

**Lulus** Power of Love red strapless jumpsuit, $68, [Lulus](https://www.pntrac.com/t/8-11575-88550-157915?sid=WWeditorial&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lulus.com%2Fproducts%2Fpower-of-love-red-strapless-jumpsuit%2F612642.html)

### 26\. Ruched metallics

This silvery gray midi reminds us of tinsel on the Christmas tree (if it was a little more elevated, obviously). A simple neckline makes room for a statement necklace, shoulder-duster earrings, or both if the dress code is cocktail attire. The ruched material hugs your curves in a fitted bodycon silhouette. Consider your December wedding guest dress found!

**Vince Camuto** metallic ruched puff sleeve dress, $109, [Nordstrom](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/metallic-ruched-puff-sleeve-dress-plus/7645358)

### 27\. Patterned mini

On the hunt for a casual wedding guest dress for the winter? This dress nails the casual aesthetic without feeling bland or boring. An ornate allover print brings celebratory vibes, while puff sleeves and a high neckline create an elevated finish. Complete your winter wedding guest look with heeled sandals and simple stud earrings that'll add subtle sparkle. 

**French Connection** Avery puff shoulder long sleeve burnout dress, $158, [Nordstrom](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/avery-puff-shoulder-long-sleeve-burnout-dress/7549384)

### 28\. Pretty pleats

This flowy style features subtle pleats, a plunging neckline, and twist-front accents. Choose from emerald green or a festive, silvery grey—both are perfect for a wintertime wedding.

**Lulus** Perfect Refinement emerald satin sleeveless pleated maxi dress, $98, [Lulus](https://www.lulus.com/products/perfect-refinement-emerald-satin-sleeveless-pleated-maxi-dress/2152416.html)

### 29\. All-out glamour 

If toning things down has never really been your style, you'll be happy to hear that a cocktail dress code is all about amping up the glamour. Winter wedding cocktail dresses are generally more extravagant than semi-formal 'fits. Take this fabulous purple midi, for example. A one-shoulder neckline, figure-hugging silhouette, and feather trim are about as fun as you can get. Time to hit the dance floor! 

**PrettyLittleThing** plus lilac satin feather trim one shoulder midi dress $130, [PrettyLittleThing](https://www.prettylittlething.us/plus-lilac-satin-feather-trim-one-shoulder-midi-dress.html)

### 30\. Velvet jumpsuit 

There's no shortage of winter-ready wedding guest outfits available on Rent the Runway. This velvet jumpsuit will definitely help you stay warm in chillier weather. 

**Bronx and Banco** Cleopatra jumpsuit, from $100 to rent, [Rent the Runway](https://www.renttherunway.com/shop/designers/bronx_and_banco/cleopatra_jumpsuit)

### 31\. Cutout details

How's this for a festive winter wedding guest dress? The silky satin material and black-on-black print are a match made in heaven, especially at this time of year. Looking for long-sleeve winter wedding guest dresses? It's got that going for it too.

**ASTR The Label** Suzie floral cutout long sleeve midi dress, from $148, [ASTR The Label](https://www.astrthelabel.com/products/suzy-floral-cutout-long-sleeve-midi-dress)

### 32\. Ribbed midaxi

Dusty purple hues are extra beautiful in the transitional period between winter and spring. When you're not quite ready for bright pastels but rich, saturated hues feel a bit too dark, dusty in-between shades are your best friend. This long-sleeve ribbed maxi is an excellent cold-weather winter wedding outfit for January and February. 

**ELOQUII** petal sleeve midi sweater dress, $100, [ELOQUII](https://www.eloquii.com/products/petal-sleeve-midi-sweater-dress/302484863.html)

### 33\. Subtle glamour

Here's another simple-but-sophisticated style you can easily rewear. This navy midi features a unique asymmetrical hem and a trendy cowl neckline.

**Petal & Pup** Cyrpus dress in Navy, $59, [Petal & Pup](https://petalandpup.com/collections/wedding-guest/products/cyprus-dress-navy)

### 34\. Gorgeous one-shoulder

In the mood for a designer moment? If you're prepared to splurge on something truly special, check out this Mac Duggal masterpiece. The statement one-shoulder dress goes big on style, with eye-catching ruffles across the neckline, shoulder, and sleeve. Wear it to a formal wedding with classic accessories (think: black stilettos and diamond drop earrings).

**Mac Duggal** Ieena asymmetric ruffled chiffon gown, $498, [Saks Fifth Avenue](https://www.saksfifthavenue.com/product/Mac-Duggal-Ieena-Asymmetric-Ruffled-Chiffon-Gown-0400019950981.html)

### 35\. Teal maxi

There are so many different types of winter dresses you can wear to a wedding. We love this strappy maxi's flowing A-line skirt and deep teal hue. This beautiful color is a slightly more unique alternative to emerald green or navy.

**Petal & Pup** Ricki maxi dress, $89, [Petal & Pup](https://petalandpup.com/products/ricki-maxi-dress-deep-jasper)

### 36\. Wrap silhouette

You really can't go wrong with a wrap dress (or faux wrap dress, in this case), no matter the season. That said, this pick is particularly fitting for winter thanks to snug long sleeves and a navy hue. The tie waist adds a sweet, figure-defining detail. 

**Leota** Perfect Wrap midi with blouson sleeve dress, $148, [Leota](https://shop.leota.com/products/perfect-wrap-midi-w-blouson-sleeve-dress)

### 37\. Faux feathers

Turn heads in this ankle-grazing maxi. The classic black hue certainly feels formal enough for this time of year, while the feather trim adds a fun, stylish touch. If it's a winter wedding cocktail dress you're searching for, complete the look with costume jewelry. Since the hem is already making a statement on its own, avoid any over-the-top jewels around your neck. Instead, opt for earrings, bracelets, or a chic hair accessory. 

**16Arlington** strapless feather trim dress, from $1,450, [Farfetch](https://www.farfetch.com/shopping/women/16arlington-strapless-feather-trim-dress-item-19090854.aspx)

### 38\. Winter blooms

Green, red, and white adorn this beautiful floral maxi dress—basically the primary colors of the holiday season. The satin material and dark green hue make it a wonderful wedding guest dress for a formal winter celebration. 

**Lulus** Still The One emerald green floral print satin maxi dress, $99, [Lulus](https://www.pntra.com/t/8-11575-88550-157915?sid=WWeditorial&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lulus.com%2Fproducts%2Fstill-the-one-emerald-green-floral-print-satin-maxi-dress%2F876542.html)

### 39\. Edgy slip

L'AGENCE pairs luxury elegance with just a hint of street style to create this beautiful slip. Bias-cut silk skims over your body in a breezy (but still flattering) silhouette. The crown jewels of this winter wedding guest dress are the gold chain straps. Chunky gold jewelry will coordinate perfectly. 

**L'AGENCE** jet chain strap silk gown, $695, [Saks Fifth Avenue](https://www.saksfifthavenue.com/product/L-agence-Jet-Chain-Strap-Silk-Gown-0400019841785.html)

### 40\. Ice blue

If Elsa from _Frozen_ was a guest at a winter wedding, this is what she'd wear. Made from comfortable stretch satin, this tea-length party dress features a cowl neckline, corset back, and side slit. 

**Azazie** Ceci stretch satin dress in Dusty Blue, $99, [Azazie](https://www.azazie.com/products/azazie-ceci-bridesmaid-dress)
