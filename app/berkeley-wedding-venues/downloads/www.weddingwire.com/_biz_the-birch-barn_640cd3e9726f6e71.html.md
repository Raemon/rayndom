__Small team (2-10 members)

The Birch Barn isn’t just a venue — it’s a love story brought to life. Owners Chuck and Dawn built The Birch Barn in 2021 on their beautiful 60-acre property in Amery, Wisconsin, originally designed for their own wedding day. Every beam, every detail, and every space was thoughtfully created to celebrate their commitment and to bring family and friends together in a place that felt deeply personal and unforgettable.

Today, that same spirit lives on in every celebration hosted here. The Birch Barn combines rustic charm with modern elegance, offering a serene backdrop surrounded by nature. With its bright, airy barn, peaceful outdoor ceremony spaces, and thoughtfully designed amenities, couples can create a wedding weekend that feels warm, inviting, and truly their own.

At The Birch Barn, family is at the heart of everything we do. We are honored to share our space with couples and families, helping them create moments they will cherish for a lifetime.

The Birch Barn is AMAZING!!!

We are still on cloud nine from our wedding at The Birch Barn! The weekend rental option was hands down one of the best parts — not having to clean up or rush out the night of the wedding made all the difference. We actually got to enjoy our night and wrap up the weekend on our own terms.  
  
The venue itself is stunning. The Birch Barn is surrounded by natural beauty and the barn is so thoughtfully laid out and decorated. Every single corner of the space is photo-worthy and created the perfect backdrop for our big day.  
  
The owners were incredible to work with — so helpful, responsive, and just genuinely kind people. They made sure everything was seamless from start to finish, and it truly was. I didn’t have to worry about a thing the entire day, which is every bride’s dream!  
  
We couldn’t be happier that we chose The Birch Barn. If you’re looking for a gorgeous venue with the most amazing owners, stress-free planning, and space to truly enjoy your wedding weekend — look no further.  
  
-Katie Hemmelgarn

5 Star Experience & Customer Service 

This venue offers a weekend rental option and it’s HANDS DOWN worth it! The stress-free opportunity to set up Friday night and host your rehearsal dinner there on-site, as well as having a stress free wedding reception with the option to clean up the next morning was so relieving and carefree! It makes a world of a difference for the bride & groom, the wedding party, the party planner, and all who is involved in set/take down! It allows for you to take your time and perfect all the details that go into the day, and a well rested evening after a long and eventful day! HIGHLY recommend booking the weekend rental package!

Dream come true!

This wedding venue was a dream come true. The natural beauty of where it’s located and how it’s designed made our dream wedding come to life! Getting to spend the entire weekend with the venue and the on-site cabin was the best part because it was stress-free and there was NO clean up immediately after the wedding! We also had some friends and family stay on-site with us which was so much fun to be together for the whole weekend. Couldn’t recommend this place more!
