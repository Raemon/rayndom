We used City Blue Print to custom make our invitations as well as our programs. They were very quick and it was easy to pick out exactly what I wanted for my programs. I did have to buy the color of card stock I wanted elsewhere because they didn't carry it, but it was much less expensive than going through another company.

Office Depot is great if you are designing your own wedding invitations and they even have some kits. If you do get them printed here, make sure you check everything before they do the final print or you will have to pay for it twice, I used to work there so I know the ends and outs. They have a great selection of paper though to find exactly what you need.

Jenni designed the invitation we had in our minds but couldn't find with other vendors. She is easy and efficient to work with and you will not find designs like hers, anywhere. We were also very happy with our save the dates and programs that she created for us.

Jill created a beautiful paper suite for our wedding - save the dates, invites, programs, menus and other signage. She was very responsive and provided quick turnaround.

We HIGHLY recommend Craftsman Paper Co! Veronica and her team are fast, responsive, helpful, and incredible what they do. They helped us create the most stunning and beautiful invitations that I've ever seen. It's funny/painful how during the wedding planning process, you sometimes spend money on things that it seems like no one notices. It's the opposite with Craftsman Paper Co. They came in at or under budget of some of the other Invitation companies we looked at, and I can't tell you how many of our guests reached out to us saying how they were floored by the quality of the invitations. If you're looking to elevate your invitations beyond the basic options at Zola or Minted or the Knot, then we highly recommend Craftsman Paper Co. We'd give them 10 stars if we could.
