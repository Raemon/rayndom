Josh was great throughout the entire process from beginning to end. We originally met him at a wedding expo in Boise and we had the best conversation. When we finished talking and walked away my wife and I looked at each other and we knew we would love to have him. Josh was there early and eager to help with the finishing touches. You could see he had talent in how smooth he was at making sure everything was running the way it was suppose to from checking on the bride, making sure my bow tie and boutonnière were on correctly. Josh curated such a beautiful ceremony that people are still talking about. He made us laugh and he made us cry. He was thoughtful, knowledgeable and he took the time to learn about a few Mexican traditions that we requested as well. The wedding was that much more beautiful with him being the officiant. Thanks again Josh for being there for our big day!

When my partner of 6 years and I decided to make it official, we had no idea the adventure that awaited us. After a smooth license application process, we hit a roadblock trying to find a judge to officiate. Enter Pauline Downey, our wedding day savior! From the moment we called her (thanks to Trent, the helpful City Clerk), Pauline demonstrated unparalleled professionalism and flexibility. Within 20 minutes of our call, she arrived at the courthouse, ready to make our impromptu wedding a reality. Pauline's warm personality immediately put us at ease. Her vast knowledge of the process made the legal aspects a breeze, and her genuine joy in being part of our special moment was evident throughout. Not only was Pauline incredibly accommodating and efficient, but she was also remarkably affordable. Her ability to drop everything and come to our rescue truly saved the day. If you're looking for a wedding officiant who combines expertise, kindness, and adaptability, look no further than Pauline Downey. She turned what could have been a stressful situation into a memorable and joyous occasion. We couldn't be more grateful for her services and highly recommend her to anyone in need of an officiant. Thank you, Pauline, for making our courthouse wedding an unforgettable experience! We will be sure to utilize your services when we have the ceremony!

Nancy did a great job with our wedding. Her ceremony is beautiful and she changed somethings to make it personal for us. We met with her once in person and then did the rest of our communicating via email which saved a lot of time. She was on time for both the rehersal and wedding, Did a great job running the rehersal smoothly. Really did all that I could ask for in am officiant. Our ceremony was beautiful. She also gave us a beautiful typed copy of our ceremony right after it was over, which I think was a great added touch. Thanks Nancy!

We were seeking an intimate, private ceremony with just the two of us. Nicolle intuitively understood our wishes for the wedding and communicated promptly for all planning. We married at my husband's family cabin, so Nicolle had to travel and also hike through a bit of terrain - which she did gracefully (and even took photos for us!) Nicolle revealed her true gift during the ceremony. Her delivery and expression were intentional, heart spoken and beautiful. As my husband said, "She nailed it". It was an honor having her with us through those moments.
