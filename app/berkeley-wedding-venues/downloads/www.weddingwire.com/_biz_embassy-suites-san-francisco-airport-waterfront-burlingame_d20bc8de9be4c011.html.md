Wedding in quarantine 

  
The best of wedding planners starts with Joanie! I was married in the middle of a pandemic, and while planning a normal wedding has enough stress of its own this event invited even more pressure. I was very grateful to have Joanie in my corner. She offered flexible deadlines, timely suggestions of solutions to counter the hindrance of social distancing, and best of all she was a friend who reminded me to enjoy the process something I often forgot. It was such a treat to work with her.
