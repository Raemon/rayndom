I am so thankful to have had Murphy Jones Collaborative organize my wedding. As a bride who wanted an alternative look, they fulfilled all of the dreams I had envisioned from fall aesthetics to the fact that it was a theme wedding (steampunk). I am also blown away by the quick thinking of Veronica in particular. The day of my wedding a few issues popped up, including my husband suit being stolen, but she was able to fix the problem without guests noticing a thing and me not lifting a finger. It truly felt like the perfect day. I highly recommend them for any bride that is looking for someone that will respect their personality and wants when it comes to their special day. They are truly creative and go above and beyond to make it YOUR day. ❤️

It was a pleasure working with Carol for my daughters wedding. Whenever I had any questions or suggestions she’d listen and either respond or work with my daughter to make sure it was still within her vision for her day. She was easy to work with and did her job making sure the vision became a reality. Thanks Carole.

My husband and I chose Courtney from La Luz Weddings and Events as our wedding planner and coordinator and we couldn't have been happier. From the very beginning, she was organized, calm, and on top of every detail. Exactly what we needed. Courtney coordinated with all of my vendors pre wedding day and had a ton of helpful templates to help you organize and plan your wedding. On the actual wedding day, she made everything flow so smoothly that my husband and I were able to just enjoy the day with our friends and family instead of stressing about what was supposed to happen next. It felt like everything magically fell into place, but we know it was really Courtney behind the scenes making it all happen. I used rental flowers and was so worried that some of the arrangements would be lost or thrown away. Courtney and her team ensured everything was set up perfectly and that everything was boxed up and ready to go at the end of the night while everyone was enjoying themselves and dancing. One thing we loved is how she kept finding us throughout the night with food and drinks, making sure we actually ate and stayed hydrated. It was such a small thing, but it meant so much and made us feel genuinely cared for. If you’re looking for someone who is organized, thoughtful, and truly invested in making your day perfect, we couldn’t recommend Courtney more. She made our day better than we ever imagined!

From the moment we met Jenna and Tessa at the Cocktails and Veils wedding event, we were super impressed and wanted to work with them. From the initial meeting to the final event, Tessa and Jenna worked tirelessly to ensure I didn't lose my head or my way in the details. From providing guidance regarding vendors, to decorating our dessert tables, guest tables, and cake they did not have a misstep. I made a mistake regarding the date, and the situation was remedied and they kept me calm regarding the whole situation. When I said I cried tears regarding realizing the mistake I am not kidding, and they were there to assist me in staying calm and assuring me it would be alright. They created customized signs, handled details while my husband and I were getting married at the church, and made sure all vendors were accounted for during the wedding. To say their services were invaluable is an understatement. Thank you Jenna and Tessa, we were truly blessed to find you and get to work with you from start to finish.

We started working with Camilla of Corazon Events a year before our wedding, and well before we had any idea we would be getting married during a pandemic. Camilla gracefully and graciously helped us turn our large wedding into a small, intimate event at home. We could never have done it without her, and she and her team made our event go off without a hitch. We are so grateful to have worked with you and gotten to know you, Camilla!

A piece of our minds regarding the gift of planning peace of mind. It is our great privilege to tell you about our experience with Vicki and Jerry Newsom. As we looked for help planning our New Mexico wedding, a close friend offered us a few recommendations. Orange September immediately stood out to us after learning they are a husband and wife team, working in unison to help other couples celebrate this momentous event. Our first conversation over the phone highlighted one of the great keys to their success - they are incredible listeners. The discussion was in many ways like a first date, or a mutual interview; a collaboration that asked both sides if they wanted to dance with the other. The “date” went smoothly because of the ease at which they put you, giving us permission to freely express who we are and how we wanted to celebrate. Our decision to let them guide us on this adventure was a simple one. As the business of planning moves forward, you begin to see the staggering amount of details required to complete the dream that we, as couples, formulate and are continuing to develop during the months leading up to the wedding - details we never would have considered, nor would we have time to. Vicki and Jerry deftly guide you with recommendations, using their vast network of connections to maximize your budget. To witness the reciprocal respect between the vendors and Orange September continually validated our decision to hire them. Multiple vendor solutions were always presented, matching us with potential partners in the shared mental model we had developed, and without exception every vendor we chose gushed about coming together again to work with Orange September. It was not only us who noticed the care involved in this process. Members of our families sought out Vicki at the wedding, expressing heartfelt gratitude for finding ways to care for the many specific needs of various family members. From accessibility issues to dietary restrictions, their attention to detail allowed us to simply be in the moment of the celebration. This never could have happened without the trusting relationship Vicki and Jerry cultivated with us. Our wedding experience was all we could have hoped for and more. Vicki and Jerry are truly gifted in articulating your wishes - they look into your heart and deliver an event that makes you feel like you are their only client. Their own vision statement says it perfectly, "We take pride in seeking the road a little less traveled, pulling inspiration from the daily lives and real life to create timeless and effortless experiences for couples and their guests. Every event should be visually inspiring from the moment your guests arrive until it's time for them to say goodbye. Our goal is to create just that … environments where people will want to stay a little longer, reconnecting with family and friends and depart wishing it to never end." That is exactly how we felt. We feel so lucky to have chosen them as our wedding planners, and even more lucky to now call them friends. Shawna and Joey Hemphill est. September 22, 2018

We interviewed several potential wedding planners and Lauren was the clear choice. She understood that my personality was more about the details and logistics than about the creative side of things. She totally filled in where I needed help creating a vision and pulling it off. Not only does she have the ability to execute on a vision, but she knows the vendors and venues in Santa Fe. Her recommendations and relationships with the vendors made for such a great experience. We could not have pulled it off without her!

We hired Cassie from Tasteful Events by Tomas for our Santa Fe elopement, and it was the best decision we could have made. We reached out to Tomas' company about 6 weeks before we ideally wanted to show up and get married, and Cassie was just brilliant. Not at all thrown for a loop by our short timeline, she took it all in and ran with it, when we told her we wanted everything but the audience--hotel, ceremony venue, cake, flowers and photographer. She helped us find everything we needed and stayed on top of every detail right up until our wedding. We trusted her to hold our 8 month old baby while we got married, if that tells you anything about how we felt about her! Cassie is warm, kind, patient (but has the right sense of urgency about wedding details!), and just all-around great at this work. If anything even started to look like it might go off the rails, she was on it before we could blink. We'd hire her again in a heartbeat!

Natalie and Celine are not only pros in the event planning business but are an absolute pleasure to work with throughout the entire process. Although they already had three other weddings scheduled the weekend of my big day, they agreed to take on our out-of-town wedding as well. They have top-of-the line quality products at reasonable prices and are quick to offer their creative vision in designing the perfect concept. They ran out of gold chiavari chairs the week of my wedding due to their high demand so they upgraded me to their vineyard chairs for the same price! I was thrilled! They added a personal touch to my wedding and I will undoubtedly go to Occasion for all my future event needs!
