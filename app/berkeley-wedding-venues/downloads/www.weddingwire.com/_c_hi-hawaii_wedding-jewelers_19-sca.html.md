Moshe’s work is beyond exceptional. Regardless of your budget he works with you to create beautiful pieces based on your vision. My engagement ring was something I immediately fell in love with! My fiancé wanted something unique for his wedding band and Moshe was able to create something upon his request. He is honest, personable, and really makes the whole experience enjoyable and stress free. We are so excited for our wedding, and would not recommend anyone else but Diamond Guy Hawaii for all your wedding needs. Everything is uniquely designed to your individual needs so when you are ready for an appointment, be sure to have ideas to show him what you’d like. He really can do anything!

Hawaiian heirloom jewelry has a distinct look, but if you are in the market, City Jewelry is the place to go. Scott designs and creates everything himself. Each piece can be customized with minimal extra expense. The metals are high quality and very durable. I get complements on my wedding ring and Hawaiian bracelet all the time.

Since my fiancé is from Hawaii it was important to me to incorporate his culture into his wedding band. We went to a Na Hoku store while in Maui and found the staff there incredibly helpful! They were kind and excited and interested in my purchase. They loved the idea of getting a ring that featured Koa wood, native to Hawaii as an inlay to the ring. The prices on their rings was very affordable. I like that they have stores in Colorado as well, so if there are any issues we can easily go and get their help/advice.
