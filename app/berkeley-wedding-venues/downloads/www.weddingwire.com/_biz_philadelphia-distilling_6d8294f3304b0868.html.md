Best Wedding Ever at Philadelphia Distilling

Our wedding at Philadelphia Distilling far exceeded our expectations. Nicole the event coordinator was in touch with us throughout the whole process, able to answer any questions we had and walk us through the day. She did an incredible job as our day of coordinator and everything ran so smoothly and without a hitch.   
  
The venue itself was exceptional. The custom cocktail creation meeting was so fun and all of our guests loved our cocktails. The layout and spacing of the event worked so well with the dance floor and the outdoor space. I was worried about having more guests than seats, but the cocktail party style high tops and other tables made it easy for anyone to sit and rest but still kept people involved on the dance floor.   
  
The food was delicious and we’ve gotten a lot of compliments on the options and the quality/taste of the food. The lighting in the room during the reception and the flowers that were on the tables created a perfect atmosphere. 10/10 recommend!

Wouldn’t change a thing! 

Our vision was to throw a fun wedding party outside of the traditional hall venues, and the distillery made for the party of our dreams! The space was beautiful and made for amazing photos. All of our friends said we had the best drinks and food of any wedding they went to. One of our friends decided to host her event there as well after attending our wedding. Our coordinator Nicole was excellent to work with every step of the way and even did great handling our “difficult” families :). We wouldn’t have changed a thing!!
