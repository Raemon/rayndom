Great DJ and Great Service

Amos Productions and DJ Aaron were awesome to work with. We had a lot of special ethnic songs that Aaron integrated into the evening flawlessly. The cummunication regarding the event was great with lots of collaboration of the music and the flow of events during the wedding.

DJ JD is the man!!

DJ JD was our wedding DJ and he was amazing to work with and so professional. Very attentive in our meetings and communicative! So happy we got to work with JD. We received many compliments of the song selections and how busy the dance floor was all night!

The Perfect DJ and So Much More!

As a wedding planner, I’ve had the pleasure of working with Amos Productions for many years, and I can confidently say they are one of the most reliable and professional DJ companies in the business. Their team is consistently responsive, organized, and on time, always arriving with top-of-the-line equipment and a great attitude.  
  
Most recently, I worked with DJ Rick, and he truly went above and beyond. In the days leading up to the event, he reached out to the full vendor team to introduce himself, provide key details, and even ask about social media sharing—something that made everyone feel like part of a well-connected, collaborative effort. On the day of, he and his assistant seamlessly set up in three separate locations (ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception) without missing a beat. Throughout the night, Rick kept the dance floor packed and the energy high. Anytime I needed help making an announcement or rallying the vendor team, he was right there to support. He even took the time to walk the bridal party through their grand entrance, ensuring it was upbeat, smooth, and fun for everyone.  
  
At the end of the night, Rick was the last one to leave, still smiling as he packed up—and that speaks volumes about his work ethic and dedication.  
  
In addition to their amazing DJs, Amos Productions also offers photo booths and lighting services, which I’ve had wonderful experiences with. Plus, their sister company, Altamont Limo, provides fantastic limo services. Booking multiple services through them often comes with great discounts, which makes an already stellar company even more appealing.  
  
I wholeheartedly recommend Amos Productions to any couple or vendor team looking for professionalism, talent, and exceptional service from start to finish.

DJ Aaron was the best! 

We had an all-around great experience with the whole company! We loved our DJ, Aaron!! He did a phenomenal job at our wedding and we're so glad we chose him! He was professional from the first phone call to the day of the wedding. He helped us with any questions we had along the way, quick and efficiently. We will definitely be recommending him and the company to our friends!

Just Perfect!!

Rick was amazing! We used him for our wedding and he went above and beyond checking in multiple times before the big day and making sure we were on the same page every step of the way. He gave great suggestions for both music and schedule/transitions and made the process so easy. On the day of, the music and MCing went perfectly! From the ceremony to reception everything was exactly how we imagined it. We are so happy to have had Rick as our DJ

Great experience working with Rick Mustafa and Amos Productions

We worked with Amos Productions for our wedding on May 18, 2025 at the Palm Event Center in the Vineyard.  
  
Rick Mustafa was our DJ and we also used their photobooth services.  
  
Rick was fantastic. We got on a call, and we immediately knew that we wanted to work with him and this team. The site was well organized, and Rick walked us through all of the steps needing to be done, checking back in regularly and ensuring that everything was in order. Rick listened to us and made sure to accommodate all of our requests.  
  
On the day of, Rick kept everything in order, making announcements and guiding guests appropriately. The music was in-line with whatever we discussed, and Rick also made sure to help us with last minute changes due to changes in schedule. Rick was just very easy to talk to and work with, and we would highly recommend him and the Amos team for anybody interested in DJ services for their wedding.  
  
The photobooth services were also great. Everybody had an awesome time, the props were a lot of fun, and our guests took tons of pictures, all of which we had access to afterwards.  
  
Thanks again to Rick and Amos Productions for making our wedding so memorable.

DJ and Photo Booth Services

Rick was amazing not only on our wedding day, but throughout the planning process. The zoom calls were extremely helpful and also gave us the opportunity to learn more about Rick and get to know him. All of our guests enjoyed the music and dancing and we received a lot of great compliments about our DJ. Everyone loved the Photo Booth and appreciated a tech being there to help run it. The backdrop looked great, and the prints came out perfectly. The digital copies are also a great keepsake to have. Couldn't be happier with the service! Thank you again, Rick, Addie and Amos Productions!

Would Recommend AMOS 

July 2024 Bride & Groom here! We really loved working with DJ Rick at Amos! He made the experience so seamless and easy for us! We had a few ideas we wanted to incorporate into our day in regards to music and he was able to make it happen no issues. Had a great experience with our photobooth and attendant, Elissa, too. Would highly recommend using Amos for your wedding DJ/Photobooth needs. Was a fabulous experience and had competitive pricing for the area! Which we love.

Outstanding!

AMOS Production was extremely easy to work with. Look no further! Michael was so fun and helpful along the way. He kept the crowd going, helped us pick out music prior to our big day and was always available if we had questions. The Photo Booth was a huge hit as well!

DJ/MC services

It was our pleasure to work with Michael. He took the time to get to know us and our music preferences/wishes for our big day, and was so helpful throughout the process. He is very experienced and offered great advice and input while also giving us a lot of flexibility to customize based on our preferences. Love the online portal, very easy and user friendly tool.

I had the pleasure of working alongside Jody Amos and his team during a wedding. In any industry it is important to get along with your peers and your vendors. As a photographer and a videographer we are all there trying to accomplish the same thing. It’s important to be respectful and considerate of what the other person is trying to do for their clients. All the members of Amos Productions were absolutely wonderful, easy to get along with, and we all did our very best to work together to do what we needed for our bride and groom to have the best experience possible. I will be highly recommending Amos Productions to my brides and grooms.
