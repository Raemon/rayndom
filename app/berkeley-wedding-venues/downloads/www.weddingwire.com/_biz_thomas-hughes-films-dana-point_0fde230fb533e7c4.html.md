They did a wonderful job on our wedding video!! They did a full length, 10 minute highlight video, and a music video that I had requested. They all came out beautifully. It took about 7 months, which is what they had told us originally. No surprises. The guys who came out to film were fun and made everybody feel comfortable. Would definitely recommend them!

My husband and I recently received our wedding video and highlight video from Thomas Hughes. The video is so much more than we could have ever imagined. We wanted to have a video to show our family and friends who couldn't attend our destination wedding and are thrilled to show them this wonderful video. Pat captured so many special moments of our day and we will always cherish it. We cannot say enough great things about this company. You will be so happy if you use this vendor. Every step of the way they were helpful, flexible and quick to respond. We are so thankful that we were recommended this company.

I hired Thomas Hughes Films to videograph my daughter's wedding because her father could not attend this important event in her life (for health reasons). I have not received the video yet but the responsiveness of the team (Alex in the office and the videographers who shot the wedding) were all very good, friendly and professional. It takes a while to get the finished product - I was told 6 months (probably since it is wedding season and there are only so many editors on staff). I don't know what the norm is but it seems like a long time to wait. I will have to review this vendor again after I receive the finished video. So far, so good!

We hired Thomas Hughes Films for our Carmel Valley wedding this past April. We absolutely LOVE the video, it has been so much fun reliving the memories from our weekend! We had the rehearsal dinner + wedding day filmed, and are so happy we did. We were so busy having fun that weekend, we hardly remember it all!! We have watched the video way too many times to admit, and have shared it with all of our family & friends. Everyone loves it!! Working with this company was so easy from start to finish, which is really such a blessing in wedding planning. I am so thankful to Alex and the rest of the company for making my life as easy as possible!  
  
We had two videographers, James and Daine, but most of the time I had no idea they were there! That was a major plus, as I can be camera shy. The video showcased the entire wedding weekend in a way that is like re-living it every time we watch it. We are SO happy we got a video. THANK YOU Thomas Hughes Films! We LOVE the video and highly recommend this company!

I have had the pleasure to work with Thomas Hughes Films for 15 years and have been extremely happy with the various videographers I have worked with, quality of the videos and their follow up. I own a wedding planning company in the Sonoma and Napa wine country, A Dream Wedding, and my team of planners always highly recommend Thomas Hughes Films to our clients.

Thomas Hughes Video Productions can provide you with a lovely representation of your Wedding Day. It can be as simple or as intricate as you would like. And, the finished product is beyond compare. Their staff is great to work with and always puts the guests as ease during the event. I would highly recommend them.

We are so glad we chose to have a videographer at our wedding! I didn't realize that it would take 4 months to get our video from them but it was worth it! We just watched the video and it was so nice! They got all of the right moments, some really funny things that I had forgotten about, and the gentlemen (sorry I don't remember his name) was very nice and had a good sense of humor. Definitely well worth using them.
