Olive Garden was a HUGE success. Great value, included chaffing supplies and plates, bowls, flatware, napkins, cups and ice. Tiramisu and black tie cheesecake were a hit.

These guys were worth every penny. The food was excellent. The staff was efficient and was willing to help with keeping our lemonade carafes full even though they didn't supply it. The decorating service was AWESOME. I don't know what other words to use. She was able to take the vision and ideas I had and make them real and even better than I had imagined. Best of all was that I didn't have to supply anything which meant I wasn't left with a bunch of extra decorations. She was so willing to be able to make small changes as the day crept closer and answer any questions that I had along the way. So even if you don't care to use their food catering services (which is excellent, so why not!), check out their decorating service. You will be satisfied!

Bridgette is astounding! I have no idea how she does it all. We had our wedding meal catered from Carinos for 150 people. As it was also Father's Day, we didn't get quite the turnout that RSVP'd and Carinos graciously boxed up the leftovers for us and made sure we knew where to grab them at the end of the night. They also offer gluten-free pasta and my dear friend who has a gluten allergy nearly cried when she had a plate of real food she could eat at an event. That detail alone, beside the fact that their food is amazingly delicious, will have me looking at Carinos first for all of my future catering needs.

MSUM was the only caterer that would prepare the meal we wanted. They listened to our ideas and then suggested some amazing ideas too. They were quick to respond, and I felt like they had our best interest at heart. Very great to work with, and amazing during the COVID drama.

Where do I Start! GREAT food, fresh and hot! The service we got from spitfire was wonderful! You get to pick and taste test your food before the wedding day. They bring extra food the day of just in case...so no worries about running out. They are fast with communicating and again the food was perfection. I even had three guests through out the night tell me how it was the best wedding meal they have ever had.

Bill Fradet was great to work with. He had a lot of good ideas. We had tomato soup shooters with mini grilled cheese and macaroni balls during the cocktail hour, which everyone seemed to love. For diner we had a choice of chicken A-side roast beef. The chicken and sides were delicious. The roastbeef tasted a little plain. The servers were decent, but they jumped from table to table.without serving everyone. They made special glutton free meals for one bridesmaids and our pastor. Id use them again and just pick a different beef.
