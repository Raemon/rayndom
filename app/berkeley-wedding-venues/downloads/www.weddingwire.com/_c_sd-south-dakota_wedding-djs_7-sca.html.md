5.0 out of 5 rating 

5.0 

My name is Terry Callender, and we had our wedding at Monick Yards in Sioux Falls this summer. Arson Lively and his team at South Dakota Wedding Pros were absolutely amazing! Everyone at the wedding kept saying how fantastic the music was, and the lights brought such a cool, energetic vibe to the party. The music during the reception was spot-on, keeping everyone on the dance floor, and the lighting setup made the whole night feel magical. My husband and I can’t thank Arson enough for making our day unforgettable. We truly had the best day ever and loved everything he did to make it so special. Highly recommend South Dakota Wedding Pros for anyone planning their big day—you won’t be disappointed!

Our wedding was our 3rd wedding with DJ Matt as the DJ and he is a blast! He kept everyone out on the dance floor all night. He took song requests and made sure everyone got to hear something they enjoyed. He was super easy to work with and is a great time! He even participated in our sparkler exit. I could not recommend him enough!

Hiring DJ Marek was hands down the BEST decision we made for our wedding! From the first conversation, he took the time to understand our style, preferences, and vision for the day. He didn’t just play music, he created the most unforgettable experience for us and our guests. The dance floor was packed all night! Marek has an incredible ability to read the crowd and play the perfect mix of songs that got everyone moving; from our grandparents to our college friends. He coordinated seamlessly with our other vendors, kept the timeline on track, and his emceeing was spot-on, enthusiastic but never over the top. We can’t say enough good things about Marek, he made our wedding a night we’ll never forget, and our guests are still talking about how much fun they had. If you want an amazing DJ who truly cares about making your day perfect, look no further than DJ Marek!

The services were so well done. They took all my input, complaints, and suggestions with such pride and charisma. Nick and Levi were so willing and eager to do whatever was wanted of myself and the groom. I am beyond grateful for their work.

Words cannot even describe how thankful we are to have had DJ Eric James as our wedding DJ. We are so grateful for everything he and the WOW team did to make our day go smoothly and put us at ease - from the planning sessions, to being open to our crazy ideas, and to handling the little things that came up throughout the night. The roasts we asked him to read during the grand entrance were perfect, the videos and pictures he took throughout the night were incredible, the personalized monogram was beautiful, and the That’s WOW Photo Booth was SO much fun (the old-school photo strips were such an amazing touch, and we are still in awe that Tara put together an entire scrapbook for us to take home at the end of the night - what an amazing gift)! Eric was the ultimate hype guy, and we had such a huge crowd on the dance floor even until the very end!! He made us feel like we were the most important and only client (even though we know he’s probably crazy busy), and we cannot thank him enough. He and the rest of the WOW team were so professional and so responsive to anything we needed. We highly recommend Eric and the WOW team to anyone and everyone!! You are the man, Eric!!!

We used Sieff Style Entertainment, specifically Zach Sieff as our DJ for our wedding on 9.21.25. I (the bride) am a lover of oldies music and classical music and Zach found the way to perfectly weave it into our day. I could not rave more about how amazing he is as a person and as a DJ. He cares so much about the couples he works with and their vision while also giving it a hint of his amazing flare. I would book him over and over again if I could. We heard countless compliments from the guests over the night about how amazing his mixing was and how he kept the dance floor packed all night. Definitely book him for any event you are ever considering having music at!

DJ Barry Robert’s captured our day perfectly. He is so professional and makes you feel so incredible comfortable. He understood what our vision was and ran with it. We met prior to our wedding and he ensured us that he will have it all under control and he did. He was able to adapt to change very quickly. You have a plan for the wedding day but we all know how fast that changes and he was quick to adapt. I could not recommend DJ Barry Roberts more!

Jason with EEG was absolutely incredible! From our very first phone call all the way up to the day before our wedding, he made sure every detail was exactly how we wanted it. He truly made us feel like family with how much he cared about making our day perfect. During the reception, and even now, guests keep telling us how amazing our DJ was! Jason not only kept the dance floor alive but also doubled as our own personal paparazzi for the night. He captured so many fun, candid moments of us and our guests that we’ll cherish forever. We are beyond grateful for his energy, professionalism, and genuine passion for what he does. I would recommend EEG to any couple looking to make their wedding day unforgettable!
