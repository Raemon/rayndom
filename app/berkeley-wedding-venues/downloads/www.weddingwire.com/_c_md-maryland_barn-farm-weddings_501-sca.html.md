While our event was a reunion and not a wedding, the professionalism, communication, and event pricing are still very relevant. I cannot express enough how fantastic Kate and the Circle D Farm staff were with helping us have a successful family reunion. Kate was kind and patient. She answered every question. Came up with solutions for various issues that we had that came up prior to the reunion. She patiently worked with me when I was out of the country and still trying to plan. She understands event planning and mentioned things that I did not consider. On the day of the event, the food was delicious, the service was excellent, and even more importantly, we did not have to worry about the logistics of food preparation and clean up. We could concentrate on being with each other and having fun reconnecting. The pricing was reasonable. We enjoyed the rustic environment of the farm. We highly recommend Kate and Circle D Farm and would definitely have a reunion there again.

Bohemia Manor Farm was the most perfect venue! My husband and I are local to Chesapeake City and when we toured the Manor House, we knew it was our wedding venue from the moment we walked in. A big reason why we loved this venue so much was because we were able to have everyone we love, like family, close friends, and our bridal party, stay in the manor house with us all weekend. Being able to celebrate the biggest day of our life with our favorite people right there with us (all three days) was so special. Another reason we booked this venue was because the property was absolutely stunning! In the beginning, we did have a little stress and hiccups with planning because of staff changes BUT everything worked out perfectly. Danielle was my venue coordinator and she was absolutely AMAZING. She jumped right in and didn’t skip a beat. When I had questions after hours about small details, she was there with an answer. She bent over backwards to make our wedding day so special and let me tell you it was perfect!

The Howard County Conservancy was the perfect venue for our November 2025 wedding reception. The staff was amazing and responded quickly to all of our questions leading up to our event. We got married at our church while our vendors set up for the reception, then had our cocktail hour on the deck and dinner/ dancing in the main ballroom area. Because the space is so beautiful on its own we were able to save a lot of time and money by keeping all of the decorations simple and minimal. We highly recommend this venue.

We are so happy we chose Bortner Valley for our wedding! The venue is absolutely beautiful, but what made the whole experience even better was the team behind it. Molly and Tracey, the owners, were amazing to work with from day one! They are super organized, quick to respond, and genuinely caring. They made sure every need was met and worked with all our vendors so the day went perfectly. By the end of it, they honestly felt more like friends than vendors. We couldn’t have picked a better place or better people. Highly recommend!

My husband and I just celebrated our wedding here, and it's hard to put into words how absolutely amazing not only the property is, but Whitney and her family. This is truly a venue that is created out of love and dreams, because Whitney is just a top tier human and venue owner. She was amazing from the start and was just so easy to talk to, get answers from, and work with as a whole. She was so flexible and easy to work with and rolled with the punches! The venue is absolutely stunning, so it really didn't need anything much added to it. But the few things I wanted to do such as hang florals from the chandeliers in the tent, she was completely on board with! They were also so helpful day of with helping us get extra tables, set up, etc. Our guests could not stop raving about the property either. We must've gotten asked at least a dozen times "how did you find this place?!" because our guests have never been to a venue such as The Manor. The bridal suite was PERFECT and enough room for myself, 9 bridesmaids, and mother of the bride to get ready in. We had two hair stylists and one make up artist as well and you didn't feel like you were on top of each other. The groomsmen suite in the converted cellar is also so fun and cool. The guys got to watch football, play pool, and have their own bar set up. I cannot wait to see the pictures our photographer got to really show off how stunning the property is. Whitney makes sure that the driveway that comes through the tree tunnel is rerouted around so that pictures can be taken underneath. I promise it's worth the hike up the hill in heels to do so! The barn, the tent on the hill, the ceremony aisle infront of a super large and old tree - it was all literal perfection. I got the forest fairy whimsical wedding of my dreams! For reference, we rented the venue for the weekend (Friday - Sunday) and set up early on Friday, then did our rehearsal dinner there, wedding Saturday, returned Sunday to clean up so we didn't have to do it the night before. Whitney and her family set up all the tables and chairs and moved furniture around for all nights for us! It really took a lot off of our plates, which was much needed. Bonus points for Otis, Whitney's dog who popped out to say hi while we were cleaning up the next day (don't worry if you're not a dog person - Whitney made sure to ask first if we wanted to have the dog out and our answer as a YES!!). He was such a cutie and made our day while cleaning! If you're in the market for a wedding venue, look no further, you found your place!!

Maxine was so great to work with. She was very responsive from the start, and communicated with us every step of the planning process including rescheduling our 2020 wedding to July of 2021. I'm sure it was a stressful time for everyone in the industry and she was so kind, professional and helpful. The delivery and coordination went smoothly of all of our vendors and I know Maxine was a huge help in making sure that all went smoothly. The bridal suite was super spacious, and full of character, there were ENDLESS photo opportunities for us on the property – water, rolling hills, the house, the horses, sunset, the patio and gorgeous fields behind the house... Everything was beautiful. The property was STUNNING. Stunning is an understatement. Our guests can not stop talking about how beautiful the property was weeks later. We adore Maxine and Harwood Farm. Her and the venue will always hold a special place in our hearts. I would 100% recommend having your wedding or special event at Harwood. I'll let the photos speak for themselves!

Vignon Manor Farm was a truly spectacular venue for our daughter’s wedding. The property is absolutely beautiful, with a perfect blend of elegance and rustic charm. Every space—from the ceremony area to the reception hall—was thoughtfully designed and created an unforgettable atmosphere for the entire day. It was the ideal setting for such a special occasion, and we couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue.

When my (at the time) fiance and I toured Stone Ridge, we fell in love with it - a beautiful venue that we picked for our wedding right on the spot. Working with them throughout the process was great and the night of our wedding was even better. Everything was organized, well put together, and looked great. We received numerous compliments from our guests about how much they enjoyed the venue and how smooth everything went. A beautiful ceremony in a beautiful venue - even if the rain didn’t fully hold off. The team’s knowledge and helpfulness provided us with peace of mind throughout our wedding day and made everything flow perfectly. Thank you to Lindsay, Jordan, Shelby and Lindsay for their help throughout.

Worsell Manor's team was so flexible to work with. From start to finish they made it seamless for us to plan and execute out wedding. Worsell Manor has a beautiful manor home and a barn that has countless areas to take photographs. The inside of the home is perfect for the bridal party to get ready, too. The aesthetics here are top notch! Highly recommend Worsell if you are looking for a fairytale wedding.
