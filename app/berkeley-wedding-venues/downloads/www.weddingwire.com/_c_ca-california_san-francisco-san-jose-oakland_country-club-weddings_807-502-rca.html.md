I recently hosted my third bridal shower at Boundary Oak, and once again, it was absolutely flawless. At this point, I’ve become something of a serial matron of honor (dear lord, no more... I say that every time), and each time I’m tasked with planning a shower, I know exactly where to go. Boundary Oak has become my go-to for a reason. The venue is beautiful, the setting is perfect, and most importantly, the team is truly exceptional. Angelique and the staff are incredibly professional, responsive, and thoughtful in every step of the process. They make planning easy, even when you’re juggling a hundred other wedding-related tasks. The space is bright, elegant, and adaptable for any vibe you're going for, and the views never fail to impress. The food is always a hit: fresh, well-presented, and something guests actually talk about afterward. And the staff during the event is just as amazing as the planning team: attentive, friendly, and on top of everything without being overbearing. After three showers here, I can confidently say that much of the praise I get for these events really belongs to Boundary Oak. They consistently deliver a smooth, high-quality experience that makes me look like I know exactly what I’m doing, even when I’m just trying to survive another round of bridal duties. If you're planning a bridal shower (or any celebration, really), I can’t recommend them enough. I’ll be back again... though hopefully as just a guest next time.

My husband and I held our wedding reception at the Bridges Golf Club, the Garden Pavilion room, and we were so delighted at how beautiful everything turned out! We worked with Sharon, who was highly responsive, flexible, and answered our many questions. Sharon was honest and provided great recommendations for the food, table layout, timeline, etc. Her feedback and wonderful communication skills made the wedding planning process so smooth. The wedding day was a breeze. The staff at the Bridges were on top of things and were on schedule. The table settings were beautiful, the staff were kind and professional, and the setting was stunning. Our guests were blown away by the spectacular views of the canyon, and took epic sunset photos. The staff always checked in on my husband and I to ensure we had sufficient food and drinks. Speaking of food, the food was so delicious! With Sharon's recommendation, we selected the prime rib, salmon, and ravioli. The portions were generous, and the guests were very impressed by the quality! We also had an open bar, and everyone enjoyed the quality of the drinks. We would recommend the Bridges without hesitation! Thanks Bridges for making our wedding day so magical.

We hosted our 3rd Annual Molly Smiles Foundation Tennis & Pickleball Fundraiser at Diablo Country Club and loved every minute! The venue is gorgeous, the courts and court house are stunning, and the staff are professional, attentive, and so easy to work with.

My son and his wife got married outdoors next to the Chapel with reception following at the Golden Gate Club. The wedding and rehearsal went so smoothly and everything was perfect! Both our son and his wife have busy jobs so working with Wedgewood was great for them. Wedgewood acts as the wedding planner. Everything was organized and laid out in a helpful book along with in person meetings. We were so happy with how everything went and would highly recommend!!

Our wedding day at Blackhawk Country Club could not have gone more perfectly. We cannot thank Andrea and the staff enough for making sure the day went off without a hitch. Without her guidance and expertise I would have been lost. Thank you Andrea and the staff at Blackhawk again so much everything! We would highly recommend anyone in the Bay Area to considering this beautiful venue!

Our wedding day was everything we dreamed of and it went off without a hitch thanks to Jenelle and the entire crew at DBGCC! Discovery Bay is my hometown and my parents are members of the club, so it meant a lot to host our wedding in a location that had a sentimental value. I did a lot of venue research and you truly cannot find another venue that is so open and friendly to making a wedding day vision come to life. I consider myself very lucky for already having a special connection with the location. Our guests have continuously shared how much they enjoyed our wedding, from the atmosphere to the great food, and now looking back myself I couldn't imagine our wedding day being hosted anywhere else. I was my own wedding planner, so I am so grateful I had Jenelle as my day-of coordinator. Thanks again Jenelle & DBGCC!

I photographed a wedding here in February of 2022. It is a gorgeous venue. The catering was delicious, the scenery was gorgeous and the hall was so perfect, with glass windows overlooking the golfcourse. It is a nice light venue, not dark and gloomy.

The Club at Castlewood - the venue is absolutely perfect. It is a beautiful place to get married. The palm trees that line the entrance is such a show-stopper. Sandy and her team were so receptive and responsive to everything my husband and I wanted. I used an outside caterer as my husband and I wanted family-style Asian cuisine so I cannot speak to the food here. I had a guest count of a bit less than 200. Pros: \- Multiple locations for guests to hang out and mingle that wasn’t the reception hall (outside patio, indoor bar area with couches, lobby area with more couches) \- Bar area was huge and quick to serve my guests. Many guests told me the bartenders that worked at our wedding were some of the best ones they’ve seen. We upgraded the bar package at the last minute, and it was worth it to us. \- The men and women’s locker room has a cute area to get ready in, chairs, couches, lounge chairs, make up stations (and showers)! They also have a lot of amenities including razors, combs, hairspray, deodorant, etc. \- Service was awesome. They refilled waters, bussed tables, all of the above. \- Allowed us to leave our decor there the day prior so we wouldn’t have to do it the day-of (even though there was an event the night before!) It was about 4 large totes, 6 smaller ones, and a few easels. \- We had asked for a golf cart to wheel some older guests back up to the reception area after the ceremony. They almost forgot this until my coordinator asked the banquet manager. Thankfully they were able to do it for us in the end. Cons: \- Outside caterer has to cook outside which is one level below the reception hall. This is particularly difficult without an elevator to help get to the reception area, especially since we were doing family-style and not buffet, which means plates for each and every table. We were able to come to an agreement on how to make it work, but it was a bit challenging on all parts. \- There’s no dedicated bridal suite so my things were out in the open for the club members to see and possibly take. On the day of, it didn’t matter too much as nothing went missing, but it was stressful thinking about it leading up to the event. I also felt bad I basically took over the whole area away from the club members. It would be helpful to have our own space to change. \- That being said, there isn’t a designated groom suite either. He had to leave his clothes in the women’s locker room after changing. We knew about the cons before booking with Castlewood, but due to how beautiful it was and that they could hold my guest count indoors in a reception room, we went with them anyway, but I still wanted to point those out to future brides and grooms.

Working with Tracey put me at ease. Her experience and professionalism were beyond my expectations! She literally was able to "predict the future" and help us make informed decisions that spared us stress and heartache on our wedding day and general planning. Her response time to emails and phone calls I wish people would take a lesson from her on that. It was flawless which made her so accountable and trustworthy. This is what every couple needs in a very fun yet, stressful time in their lives. Tracey is an asset to this venue.

We hosted a wedding at Club Los Meganos on 11/8/24. Katrina, Lily, and staff were very professional, collected, responsive, and helpful throughout this process. The venue offers many delicious food options and really puts your vision together. There are not enough words to say to recommend this venue as it is perfect to host a wedding of any size and any time of the year. Katrina was so calm and cheerful the day before and the day of that it helped me calm down and not stress. I enjoyed this venue as they have great recommended vendors and room for creativity, and it was great not to have to outsource everything. I highly recommend touring the venue and talking with the staff to see the vision come together and answer all your questions.
