John was very professional in creating a ceremony that we wanted. From the very first meeting (we spoke over the phone since we live in Buffalo, NY), he brought warmth, professionalism, and sincerity to helping create the ceremony that we were looking for. He really took the time to get to know us and crafted a ceremony that felt personal, meaningful, and also felt true to ourselves as a couple. He was super responsive and helpful and we were able to customize out ceremony to fit our style and comfort level . We received so many compliments on how beautiful the ceremony was. One of the family members wanted a copy of the script since it was so memorable. We couldn't have imagined the day without him. We definitely recommend him

Sarah helped me officiate my brother’s wedding. Sarah provided many resources and guidance. After the vows, wedding guests came up to me and said the ceremony was PERFECT. Part of the process, which involved interviewing the couples, the best man, and the maid of honor, actually not only yielded a very complete picture of the couple’s love, which I was able to share with the audience that day, but the interview process also supported the couple in composing their vows, and I suspect it helped the best man and maid of honor write even better speeches. So grateful to Sarah for sharing her craft with me. It was an enormous help!

I wanted to elope in Colorado but we are from out of state. I had no idea where to start planning but Iver really helped with everything. It was a very smooth process and straightforward which I really appreciate. Once I booked him everything fell into place. I am very happy we decided to do this. He was very accommodating and helped my dream come true. Overall very happy with this service.

I cannot speak highly enough of the support Carey gave my husband while he planned a surprise elopement for us. To be clear—I was the one surprised! He spent months organizing this amazing wedding in Colorado without me knowing, made even more challenging since we live in New Hampshire. Carey, the kindest soul, helped him with every aspect of the event. She offered support and assistance far beyond what anyone could ever expect from an officiant. The evening was beautiful, and she was the perfect person to usher us into the next phase of our lives. Now, a month later, my husband still says it felt like he had a true friend helping him every step of the way.

Lisa was a fantastic officiant for our wedding this September. She was professional, transparent and easy to communicate with. Most importantly, she dedicated a good amount of time to getting know us and she encouraged us to be mindful of the ceremony portion of our wedding when it was all too easy to be focused on the event logistics and other small things. Overall, we had an extremely meaningful and personalized ceremony and hope to have a continued relationship with Lisa.

Matt Raynak did a fantastic job officiating our wedding ceremony! He was very easy to work with from day one, and just had a great personality. He focused directly on our needs and requests and helped make our day so special and beautiful. He reminded us that it was our big day, and he worked hard to make our ceremony exactly the way we envisioned it. You will not regret choosing Matt as your officiant! We are nothing but pleased with his services. :) The Ogletree's

Jan was so sweet and perfect for our wedding! She helped us craft the perfect ceremony designed for us and kept us on track for our vows - which were the highlight of the day. We got to know her throughout the process and she fit right in with our friends and family. We would highly recommend hiring Rev. Jan to perform your ceremony!

Marcia drove from Denver to Vail in a snowstorm to get us married. She not only did an incredible job during the ceremony, but also took the time beforehand to learn more about us and know exactly what we wanted for our special day. She was responsive to any requests we had and so kind throughout making it feel like the day was truly about us. The ceremony itself was beautiful and full of love. We couldn’t have asked for anything better. We would highly recommend her for any ceremony!
