I have been gushing about Fonte Sala and Lorenzo since our wedding this October. When we drove into the property the first time I cried a little (it’s that beautiful), the roses were blooming and the vineyards were changing color and the statuesque villa was enough to take your breath away. From the minute I booked with him, Lorenzo was incredibly responsive, kind, and went out of his way to help us ensure everything was ready for our big weekend. He connected us with a wedding planner, answered my (many) questions, coordinated wine delivery, set up lights and tables, was flexible with last minute guest count changes, and was always willing to stop by and chat with us throughout our stay. We really felt so welcomed and taken care of, their hospitality is unmatched. The villa was perfect for our 50 person wedding. We booked it for four nights and were able to host half our guests on the property. The separate apartments mean that there is plenty of space, the kitchens are well appointed, there are lots of opportunities to gather inside and out. Our offsite guests dropped in throughout the weekend (as well as for planned events like our welcome party and wedding reception), and we had plenty of seating and places for people to mingle. The pool was a hit, as was the onsite wood fired pizza oven. You MUST walk down to Osteria I’ll Sagrantino (10 minutes walking). It’s a beautiful little restaurant with amazing food, they hosted our whole group for our rehearsal dinner and their patio is magical. I highly recommend hiring the pizza chefs that Lorenzo and Silvia (our wedding planner) coordinated for us, the food was amazing and our guests were thrilled. We were blessed with perfect weather, and were able to open all the large windows and hold our events outside, it was magic. Even if weather doesn’t cooperate, they can help you coordinate a tent and their are a few big spaces on the property indoors to gather too. The team did an incredible job setting up our wedding reception, our cocktail hour with a view of the valley at sunset will forever live in my mind, and the long tables set next to the villa with overhead string lights made for a very romantic setting. The caterer they arranged was SO GOOD- multiple guests thought that the cocktail hour appetizers were dinner and were surprised when we sat down for four more courses. You will not regret getting married here, I’m considering renting it again for regular anniversary parties because it was that much fun. Thank you again Lorenzo!!! Note: I don’t have my professional pictures back yet, so the ones included here are a collection from our guests.

Our experience at Belagaggio was beyond magical, and words will never fully capture the gratitude we feel. We were fortunate enough to celebrate our wedding here over three unforgettable days with our closest friends and family, and it was nothing short of a dream. From the very beginning, Giorgio guided us with care and expertise through every stage of the planning process. His kindness, patience, and attention to detail gave us such peace of mind and made what could have been a stressful journey feel joyful and effortless. We could not imagine having done this without him. Once on site, we were welcomed with such warmth by Martha, Angela, and Antonella, whose graciousness and generosity made us feel not only cared for but truly at home. Their thoughtfulness touched every part of our stay — from ensuring every little detail was perfect, to making our guests feel cherished. We will always remember the smiles, the kindness, and the way they poured so much heart into making our celebration extraordinary. The beauty of the venue itself speaks for itself — breathtaking views, elegant spaces, and an atmosphere that felt timeless and romantic. But what we will remember most is how loved and supported we felt every moment we were there. Our guests were in awe, not only of the setting but also of the warmth and seamless experience created by the entire team. We are endlessly grateful to everyone at Belagaggio for giving us the most meaningful start to our marriage. This place, and the people who make it so special, will forever hold a piece of our hearts.

Dario and Armine were the ultimate hosts for our three day wedding. We had 23 guests total. The first night we had a welcome party with a live band and a gelato cart. The second night we had a semi-formal rehearsal dinner with grilled meats and the third day was wedding day. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious. Every single thing they served us was amazing. Breakfast was included each day. They helped arrange a private wine tasting with the neighboring winery. That was a fun experience. The property itself was breathtaking. Pictures do not do it justice. We would definitely recommend this farm to everyone looking for personal service, amazing food and warm hospitality within a low/moderate budget.

A great place to have a wedding. Very cozy atmosphere, the restaurant food is of extremely high quality and so delicious. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Our wedding was exactly as we dreamed. We were very satisfied and recommend it to everyone who loves delicious food, good service and coziness.
