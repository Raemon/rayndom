Ann, Dom, and the whole team at Wente made our wedding day an absolute dream come true! The food was spectacular (which is surprisingly rare at weddings!!) They even went out of their way to accommodate special diets and allergies!! The venue was just stunning! Truly, the photos don’t do it justice! Dom (or event coordinator) had everything running like a well-oiled machine! It was just a picture perfect day! I would recommend Wente for any and all events, big and small! We absolutely loved it! Enough so that we went to their sister site Murrieta’s Well the next day for some wine tasting with close friends and wedding guests! Top notch hospitality all around!

My husband and I had our wedding this past October at Poppy Ridge and it was an amazing experience! Abby and Tiffani were both extremely helpful and communicative. Tiffani went above and beyond on the day of to make sure everything ran smoothly and made us feel extremely supported. The venue is absolutely stunning at this time of year, our guests had an amazing time and the food was delicious! The amount we spent was well worth it and reasonable. We can’t wait to play some rounds of golf and grab a bite of the delicious food again. Please don’t hesitate to call or tour this place for your special day!

Our wedding weekend at the Purple Orchid was outstanding! The venue was beautiful- a lovely setting for both the ceremony and reception. Our guests commented on the quality of the food and the attentive service throughout the weekend. Interactions with the staff of the Purple Orchid were very good- everyone was friendly and helpful- on rehearsal evening, on wedding day, and at the brunch on Sunday. Thanks to Taylor, Rhiannon, and Derrick for their friendliness and organization throughout- we were able to enjoy ourselves completely!

I photographed a wedding here in October 2022 and it is such a beautiful venue! So many great areas for photos. The inside of the event center/barn is pretty dark, but is beautiful with wine barrels on each side and hanging chandeliers. The only thing that I don't like is that they're ceremony time is so late, by the time the ceremony ends, the sun is setting and you have to rush for sunset portraits. No time for family photos. You would have to do a first look.

Rios-Lovell has a beautiful vineyard, gazebo, pavilion, reception room, and ballroom. There is also a nature reserve across from Rios, so the view is gorgeous. Rios was a significantly more affordable venue than the other wineries in the area. The staff was great to work with. They helped us with a payment plan. They welcomed us whenever we brought family and friends by to show them the venue in the months leading up to the wedding. They coordinated with us to set up and decorate, and helped us bring in our own caterer. We had about 250-300 guests and over 50 of them were kids, so we were intent on finding a venue that had plenty of space for kiddos and was also away from the road or parking lot. The kids at our wedding had plenty of space to run around and play. We had our receiving line in the front room, buffet in the main room, drinks and hor d'oeuvres at the wine bar, dinner in the green space, dancing in the gazebo, and the candy bar and games in the pavilion. Highly recommend this venue!

This is the most darling place. When I visited this site for the first time, I feel in love with it and wanted to get married there. It has a nice intimate rustic feel and has so many lovely details...a red barn, chicken coop with live chickens, vintage clawfoot bathtub, bocce ball court are just some to name many... Brett was extremely hospital on our wedding day....he even got a ladder to get fresh fruit from his trees because my family wanted them and opened his private tasting room for my guests to hang out because the evening got chilly. His (and dog Max's) presence there put us at ease and we really enjoyed ourselves that night. If I could get married all over again, it must be at Boaventura de Caires!
