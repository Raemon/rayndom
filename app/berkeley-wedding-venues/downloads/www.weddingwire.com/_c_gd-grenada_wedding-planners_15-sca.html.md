I read lots of great stories and some bad ones about Hangers. Obviously, a wedding can serve as great anxiety for those involved in it. Everybody wants it perfect and it almost never is. Also, wedding planners are many times limited to a certain extent as to what they can do when a supplier fails to deliver. These are definitely things you must always keep in mind when describing one's service. Let us tell you how our experience was: We contacted the wedding planner Khaleen with VERY short notice. We set our own plans for our wedding until we realized that this was just way too much headache, organizing to deal with on our own. She had 2 weeks to put everything together. Fortunately, she took us on as clients (others did not due to the time limitations we had). We had some specifics we wanted but we did not want a big wedding, rather intimate and hassle-free; after all, this was OUR day! Khaleen and Sascha made the necessary arrangement and halfway there we implemented some add-ons. I must say "Hangers" was very flexible in terms of working with the changes. They were on point, up-to-date, and kept us posted every step of the way. They co-ordinated everything timely (something of which they did not have much of) and they made this whole experience so much smoother. We also described the type of officiant we would like and our pastor could not have been a better choice. What a wonderful man! I even put in a special request for after our wedding and they promised to do just that and free of charge. Honestly, we could not possibly be happier for choosing Hangers. A big thank you to the entire team who was a part of our big day and for making it so much easier.

Carats and Champagne truly made our wedding dreams come to life! From the initial consultation to the final day, their team demonstrated unparalleled professionalism, creativity and attention to detail. They took our vision and elevated it beyond our expectations, ensuring every moment was a magical as we imagined. With Carats and Champagned at the helm, our special day was flawless, unforgettable, and filled with love. Highly recommend!
