Axl is a wonderful DJ! He was extremely personable, flexible, and hilarious. It felt like he was another guest at our wedding and not just our DJ. His music choices were excellent and his set up was subtle, and out of the way, yet the music carried throughout the venue without being overbearing. My husband and I would highly recommend My Way DJs (especially Axl) for any event!

Thank you to both DJ Inessa and the AZBestDJ.com team. We recently hosted a quinceañera for our daughter, and DJ Inessa absolutely delivered. From the first song to the last dance, she had the teens engaged.We were especially happy to find a DJ company that offered a fantastic female DJ. My daughter and her friends connected with Inessa right away, and you could tell they felt comfortable and energized by her presence. She understood the vibe, kept things flowing, and played a perfect mix of music including some songs we requested ahead of time and also some day of on the spot requests too . We originally booked through DJ Daniel, who was professional, responsive, and explained that since Saturdays are in such high demand, he often assigns one of his trusted DJs. He thought DJ Inessa would be a great fit. He was right. The booking process was smooth and well-organized. We received planning forms in advance, and DJ Inessa met with us virtually to go over quince-specific music and announcements. Everything was planned out thoughtfully, and the event ran flawlessly. 5 stars :) If you are looking for a DJ for a once in a lifetime special event, I can’t recommend DJ Inessa enough. The experience and results were outstanding from start to finish.

Jordan was awesome! Kept the ceremony cocktail hour and reception running smoothly. We really appreciate how he got all of the guests seated for dinner and cut the dances at the right times. We got so many compliments on him by the end of the night! The whole crowd was engaged and he mixed the songs perfectly to keep the dance floor busy all night long. Would highly recommend working with Jordan!

Our DJ was the best ever! He listened to the details of what I was after for our wedding, studied our interests and then synchronized the most beautiful playlist! He went above and beyond to make my fairytale dreams for music come true! He made our wedding the best the family has ever had and got my family dancing!

We hired DJ Flo as our DJ for our wedding and she was awesome! Super responsive and easy to work with and she made sure everything ran smoothly and helped bring our vision to life. We had a few hiccups with the dancing fog machine, but that was more due to our venue’s restrictions on the number of machines we could use. Definitely check with your venue ahead of time if you’re hoping for that dramatic, dense fog! That said, the bit of fog we did get still added a great vibe to the dance floor. All in all, Stacey did a fantastic job and we’re really happy we had her on our big day!

We had a BLAST with DJ Adi at our wedding! He played the dhol and kept the energy up for the baraat, seamlessly aided in announcements for the ceremony, and curated such a great vibe for the cocktail hour and reception. People could not stop dancing! Here are some texts we received after the wedding from our friends and family: "Can't stop thinking about last night, I literally need that DJs business card" "Props to your DJ for being the best wedding DJ of all time" "Great job picking your DJ, he was fire” Picking a great DJ can take your wedding from good to AMAZING, and DJ Adi did just that. In addition, he was incredibly kind, communicative, and aware of our desires for our wedding day. We could not have picked a better DJ :)

Tony was an incredible DJ!! While we were planning our wedding, we had multiple phone calls with Tony and his enthusiasm and passion for DJing is evident and made us so excited for our big day. Once the day came, Tony was professional, fun, energetic and picked the absolute BEST dancing songs. Our guests were dancing all night long and we had so many guests come up to us and tell us what an incredible DJ he was!! We would HIGHLY recommend him to anyone who is looking for a DJ for their event!

He did such a great job, we had gone through the songs on my playlist, and he supplemented and took some requests for songs that everyone really enjoyed and loved.

If you’re looking for a DJ who can truly elevate your event, look no further. We partnered with DesertHouse Productions (specifically Drea Strickler) for our magical wedding in Arizona. To this day—two years later—she remains the vendor we rave about most. She didn’t just play music; she engineered an atmosphere. From the reception to the after-party, she curated a soundscape that felt authentically “us.” Her instinct for reading the room is unmatched, and her range across genres—especially her house selections—took the night to another level. As someone who is borderline obsessed with music and the ambience it can create, I can say confidently that she exceeded every expectation. Her taste is impeccable, her transitions seamless, and her presence warm and professional. She made what was already the most important day of our lives even more unforgettable. Our guests still talk about the dance floor energy and the after-party she facilitated. It was the most fun, joy-filled night, and her talent was the driving force behind it. We will be forever grateful for the magic she brought to our wedding. If you want a DJ who is both wildly skilled and genuinely wonderful to work with, she’s the one!!!!
