The Baucom House was the absolute perfect wedding venue for our special day. Everything you could possibly need is right there, with a wonderful set of staff to help execute your plan. We initially heard about BH when we got engaged on a tropical vacation, & just so happened to meet a couple at the same resort for their honeymoon who were also from the triangle area. Small world! They mentioned they’d been the first wedding at this gorgeous venue: Baucom House. They gave such a rave review that we had to check it out. When we got back in town, we took a tour & it ended up being perfect for us - call it fate! Lauren & her crew were so wonderful to work with throughout the planning process. It really is a gorgeous, timeless property that ended up being the most amazing venue for our wedding day. We got the package that allowed my bridesmaids & I to spend the night at the venue the night before, & absolutely loved it!!! It felt so close & convenient for our local guests, yet so private & peaceful. You won’t regret booking the Baucom House!

The Stockroom at 230 was an absolutely beautiful venue for our wedding! We had so many compliments from guests on the stunning decor and details in the building, friendly staff, and ease of use in downtown Raleigh. Natalie was so helpful, communicative, and kind from the beginning of our venue search to the days after the wedding. The entire team made sure we were taken care of- I cannot say enough good things about the staff. The Glass Box was an incredible place to get ready and take photos with my ladies, and the guys enjoyed their getting ready space too. The space was exactly what we dreamed and would highly recommend. They made it a truly magical day.

My husband and I got married at Rose Hill on October 4th, 2025. We never even toured another venue, we knew from the moment we were there this was the place for us! We chose the swan gazebo as our location and the views, the lighting, the swan, it was all so perfect! The staff at Rose Hill is incredible and so attentive, they made the process so seamless. We love this place and hope to visit this special place again in the near future! With Love, The Dennys

Mrs. Gretchen, Mrs. Angie and their team are absolutely amazing! They go above and beyond to remove all stress from the bride and groom. The venue is gorgeous allowing you to be as elaborate or simplistic with your decor. We were married in July and had the ceremony at 7pm in the courtyard. The natural light and setting was simply perfect for the photographer. And the extra bonus for us was that we were informed that the proceeds the venue receives goes to the Charlotte Fire Dept. I more than recommend using The Palmer Building for your events. 5 stars all the way!

I can't say enough about this venue. The location, the ambience, the staff made the wedding day an unforgettable experience. But what makes this venue stand out is the willingness of the staff to work hard and be available to make the occasion spectacular. Meredith was always available to answer questions and help out in any way we asked. Her presence and professionalism helped to make the wedding day unforgettable. It's a wonderful space and place for both the rehearsal dinner and wedding. 5 Plus Stars.

The Bradford was truly the perfect wedding venue, and it’s easy to see why they come so highly recommended. Every single one of our vendors spoke incredibly highly of The Bradford, and after experiencing it ourselves, we completely understand why. From start to finish, the entire day felt seamless and stress-free thanks to their exceptional organization and attention to detail. The team was professional, responsive, and always one step ahead, making sure everything ran smoothly without us ever having to worry. They coordinated effortlessly with our vendors, which made the day flow beautifully and allowed us to fully enjoy every moment. The space itself is stunning, but what truly sets The Bradford apart is the team behind it. Their experience, care, and dedication made our wedding day feel easy, joyful, and perfectly executed. We couldn’t recommend The Bradford more highly to any couple looking for a venue that truly delivers in every way.

We planned a very small wedding and reception (40 ppl) at Little Drum Landing in 14 days. Lindsey the coordinator was very responsive and helpful in the planning. The venue included all tables, chairs, china, utensils and set up so we didn’t have to worry about anything! The appetizers and main were delicious and the service from the staff was exceptional. It was affordable and low stress which is exactly what we needed.

We held our wedding at Brick and Mortar and when I tell you they're the best possible venue choice you could find, I'm not lying. The entire planning process was seamless, wonderful, fun, helpful, and flexible. The venue is BEAUTIFUL, spacious, and has a on-site bridal suite and grooms suite. The balcony second floor was the perfect place for us to hold our cocktail hour while the ceremony space was flipped to the reception. They offer food/catering and bar services although you don't have to book through them, I don't know why you wouldn't. The catering was some of the BEST food I've ever eaten in my life (shoutout Craig) and the menu is completely customizable. When we wanted customized appetizers for cocktail hour, Craig sat down with us to create the exact passable apps that we were looking for. The dinner was served buffet style, and was delicious and hot. I'm still dreaming about the pesto ravioli and sirloin!!! Bernice was our main contact for planning purposes and she was so friendly and sweet that I seriously squealed when I saw her two different times on wedding day. My bridesmaids were obsessed with the bartender, Lorenzo, and I found the bar packages to be very fairly priced especially considering that it included the staff and the glassware. I cannot say enough good things about Brick and Mortar Events and if you choose them for your wedding venue you will NOT regret it, trust me!!

The venue itself is absolutely stunning. Decorating felt effortless because the space is already art. Every corner carries character, history, and beauty. It doesn’t need to be transformed, it enhances whatever vision you bring. Mr. Greg, Mrs. Edie, and the entire team are some of the most solution-minded, knowledgeable, and genuinely caring professionals we’ve ever encountered. Their experience shows in every interaction. They anticipate needs before you even voice them, which allowed us to completely flow through our day with calm and confidence. By the end, they didn’t feel like staff, they felt like family. Our guests are still talking about the beautiful lighting and delicious signature drinks. Several of our family members have stated that they plan to make dinner reservations here since our wedding meal was so phenomenal. We just thank them and remind them it’s a venue. When you serve 5 star meals as an all inclusive wedding venue, it confuses people lol. The overall ambiance perfectly captured our style: Timeless, warm, and glamorous.It truly doesn’t get any better than The Millennium Center!
