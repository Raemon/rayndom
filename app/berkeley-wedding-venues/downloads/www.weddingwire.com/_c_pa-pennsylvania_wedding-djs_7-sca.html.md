Michael Kane DJed our wedding back in May 2025 and we were thrilled with how everything went! He was so so so easy to work with and he listened to what type of music we liked and helped us with deciding which songs would work well together! He had everyone on the dance floor the entire night, so I would say it was a success!!! We would highly recommend him!!!

Richie was an essential part of our wedding—he absolutely nailed the vibe! Music is such an important part of our lives, and he kept the energy going from start to finish with a perfect mix of songs that had us (and our guests) dancing all night long. From our first dance to the final song, everything flowed seamlessly. He read the room so well, kept the dance floor packed, and made sure everyone—from our youngest guests to the oldest—had a blast. The photo booth add-on was also a huge hit and added such a fun, interactive element to the night. We’re still laughing at some of the photos! Richie helped make our wedding unforgettable. If you want a DJ who truly gets how to create a great party atmosphere and is super easy to work with, Richie is your guy. Highly recommend!

Blake was amazing to work with! He provided his DJ services for our wedding ceremony and reception, played acoustic during cocktail hour, and provided his photobooth for the reception. Our wedding day layout was not easy to maneuver and parking was difficult between venues and he did it all perfectly without any complaints. We would recommend Blake to anyone looking for wedding entertainment!

Tracy was the absolute best DJ we could have ever asked for! Our guests loved the music he chose and the dance floor was packed the entire night. Leading up to the wedding, Tracy was so organized and really made sure he had a plan for our wedding day. He is so professional. You would be so lucky to have him as your DJ!

We hired No Macarena for our wedding on 1/10/2026 at the College of Physicians in Philadelphia. First off, their administrative process was very easy and helpful. No Macarena was on a list of preferred vendor we received from our venue/catering company. Their website was easy to navigate and gave us a very good sense of what they were about. It was important to us to have more unique song choices and we didn’t want to include certain typical reception games that just weren’t our style. In hindsight we felt they were true to their name (though they will play the Macarena if that’s what you want), they were comfortable working outside the box with us (not that we were all that far outside of it). Their communication was prompt and helpful. The contracting process was easy. Their pricing was very reasonable, though we didn’t shop around extensively since they already came well recommended. We communicated with Sarah administratively and then were directed to Ryan who was our performing DJ for the event. They had us fill out a questionnaire and create playlists of music we wanted at different parts of the event. Then we had a very constructive meeting with Ryan where we were able to tell him what we wanted and he guided us through clarifying things we wanted, things we didn’t know we wanted until he offered it, and what we didn’t want, that in hindsight he did an excellent job respecting our preferences. Preceding the start of the event, we only made it on-site shortly before our ceremony started due to our photography schedule. Ryan was very tactful and polite about asking us questions to assure things were setup the way we wanted, without overloading us while we were busy taking care pictures and preparing other aspects of the event. Nothing felt extraneous or burdensome, only helpful and perfectionist. The event went better than we could’ve hoped, and a large portion of the credit for that, especially regarding our reception, can be attributed to Ryan and the company he was representing. We picked a lot of songs we wanted him to play, and restricted him on use of remixes and crowd favorites. He did an incredible job organizing the music to play through the event seamlessly, cutting and speeding song up without them sounding weird in order to play almost every song that we selected. He had great equipment, everything sounded good, but also wasn’t overpowering. Our guests had so much fun, we loved it, and it wouldn’t have been what it was without him. He even took some extra videos for us of some special moments, which was especially appreciated as we did not choose to hire a videographer. We can’t thank him enough!

Hiring DJ Steve Lebo was one of the best choices we made for our wedding! From start to finish, he delivered an incredible experience and truly made our night unforgettable. Quality of Service: Steve was amazing at reading the crowd and kept the dance floor packed all night! He played the perfect mix of songs we love and added just the right energy to keep everyone dancing. His collaborative approach helped us find the music that matched us perfectly, and we had multiple guests tell us he was the best DJ they’d ever heard! The blend of live mixes and original tracks was such a great surprise and really made the evening feel unique. Responsiveness: Communication with Steve was seamless—he was always quick to respond by email, phone, or text. We felt supported at every step, knowing we could reach out whenever we had questions or last-minute ideas. Professionalism: Steve’s professionalism was top-notch. Despite dealing with a difficult wedding coordinator at the venue, he handled every situation with a smile and kept a polite, positive attitude. He expertly guided us through the planning process, ensuring the night reflected our vision. His attention to detail and commitment to our experience went far beyond our expectations. Value: DJ Steve was worth every penny. He went above and beyond with additional lighting, sound equipment, extra DJ setups, and microphones, which made a huge difference. We even had friends whose DJ didn’t bring backup equipment and ended up with a portable speaker in a rainstorm! Steve always travels with spares and guarantees the quality, which provided us with priceless peace of mind. Flexibility: Steve worked with us up to the very last minute to make sure everything was perfect. His flexibility and willingness to adapt helped everything run smoothly, even as we made a few changes just before the big day. Overall: We couldn’t be happier with our choice. Steve is a true professional, a hard worker, and a fantastic DJ who knows how to keep a party going. If you want a DJ who cares about making your night perfect and will go above and beyond, DJ Steve Lebo is the one! Highly recommend him for anyone looking to start an unforgettable celebration.

Excellent DJ service! We had guests complimenting DJ Jake weeks after our wedding. This team is highly professional and we couldn’t have asked for a better entertainment service. DJ Jake was punctual with every song choice, extremely personable, and did a phenomenal job. Thank you SO much FC Productions!!!

Scott was an amazing addition to our wedding team. He was incredibly responsive and professional. He sent us an extensive questionnaire and really listened to what we wanted. Our wedding was in May and he was able to provide a mic for our vows and played our entrance music for our outdoor ceremony and outdoor Cocktail Hour. I had made edits to our first dance track and Scott was able to play my version without batting an eye. During the reception (indoor) he played the perfect mix of traditional wedding music and our more niche tastes. He artfully live mixed the tracks for seamless transitions and was able to read the crowd to keep the vibe alive. Everyone (and I mean everyone!) was on the dance floor the whole night - he truly made our wedding an unforgettable experience. I would highly recommend Scott (and his team)!
