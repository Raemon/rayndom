We had our ceremony in the Plaza with our reception in the South Pacific Aquarium, in front of the shark tanks. From start to finish, Lancer Catering (Chip Venzone specifically) was great about answering all of our questions in a very timely manner. We were on a pretty tight budget, but Chip helped us put together a night that we will never forget. We had several compliments on the wedding, and both my wife and I agree that it was even more than we had hoped for. I would absolutely recommend PDZA as a venue!

WOW! We can’t say enough about the Seattle Aquarium for a wedding or special event venue! We had our wedding there this past June 2022 and from start to finish the entire process and experience was flawless. Chelsea and Philadelphia our wedding coordinators with the Seattle Aquarium team were a pleasure to work with and went above and beyond to make our dream a reality. It was so easy and fun to collaborate with them and The Seattle Aquarium venue offers it all. They have in-house catering, all the seating and linens, lighting, music plug ins and multimedia screens and endless possibilities to use the aquarium venue space. We had our ceremony right on the beautiful waterfront back pier, cocktail hour in the touch tank area and our dinner reception in the main hall with the enormous fish tank behind our wedding party main table. The dinner food was absolutely fantastic with amazing presentation. We truly can’t recommend the Seattle Aquarium enough for any special event or wedding!

I write this review from an event professional standpoint, as I recently did a few private parties at LeMay - America's Car Museum. The staff is great to work with, and the early load-in day-of is a time saver! The cars are the real eye candy, and they do rotate out on a regular basis. If you are planning a wedding or private party on the top floor, make sure your entertainment brings in multiple speakers. As a DJ, I've found the solution to this cavernous room is more coverage, not pushing the volume.

Bramble and Wood and the entire team at Woodland Park Zoo were such a joy to work with! After our former venue closed suddenly four months before our date, we selected the Woodland Park Rose Garden to hold our wedding and can't believe that wasn't the plan from the start! They were so patient and thoughtful as we had many questions planning sight-unseen from across the country, and our wedding at the Rose Garden turned out even more beautiful than we'd imagined. All of our guests raved about the garden's beauty, and we especially love that it's a public park that we can go back and visit again and again to reminisce on our wedding day!

Dave and all of the other staff we interacted with were wonderful. I dropped into the museum several times during the planning process and they were always accomodating of my questions and concerns. We added a couple of extra hours to our package, maxing out our time at the venue allowing guests to be there from 5-11pm - the time flew by and was probably a little late for some of our older guests. Nonetheless, we got soooo many compliments on the venue. The museum is very accessible and temperature controlled which was wonderful for a summer wedding.

We had a wonderful experience working with the TAM on our wedding, and Angie was incredibly helpful every step of the way. Hosting a wedding in a museum is a unique opportunity and can have its limitations, however we appreciated how Angie helped us get creative with the space to comfortably accommodate our 175 guests. She was responsive, organized, and made sure all the details were covered so we could enjoy the day stress-free. The wedding came together beautifully and went off without a hitch!

The Chinese Room is fabulous. The photos make it look wildly bright, but that is the camera flash, not the actual experience in person. This venue will make your wedding look like a million dollar event. This is a perfect venue for a very small wedding. The room handled around 60 people with plenty of room for a small band. It can hold 90, but we wanted space. The venue is completely updated and a bargain. They have a great selection of approved catering companies and the prices are very flexible at each caterer, so you can spend as you can afford. The venue has an excellent bar area for your caterer. Some vendors allow you to buy the alcohol from Costco directly and they provide a licensed bar tender at a small fee. You get your own elevator operator for your event! The floor below is where the caterers work. You see only the food and beverages, not the workers. Here are my photos: https://www.flickr.com/photos/luckykelly/sets/72157646043649442/

The wedding was amazing!!!! It felt magical! I could not have asked for anything more. All of our guests had loads of fun. My wedding will be talked about for a very long time. I love how we were able to have a beautiful ceremony and then playful fun for the reception. The HOCM staff were wonderful! They were out of the way but close by! The price may seem high but when you consider that you have the staff and a coordinator it is more than worth every single penny. When I arrived I was actually able to just enjoy myself and get ready. It was a pure joy to not worry about getting things set up. I cannot say enough good things. HOCM made my wedding dreams come true.
