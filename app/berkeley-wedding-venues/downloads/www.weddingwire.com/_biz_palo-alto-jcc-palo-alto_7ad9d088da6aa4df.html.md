I love this venue

Megan and Jen made my special day so beautiful and easy. I contacted them and always had questions and they were more than happy to answer and provide all the answers for me. The Fredenrich Conference Room was gorgeous and the views were gorgeous and I cannot stop gushing about how wonderful the staff were at Oshman Family JCC

This is absolutely the best venue for a wedding! We worked with Ed, Jen, and Brian, and they all have professional, friendly, and overall amazing personalities. Jen handled all the wedding day coordination and she was so well organized and even made sure the bride and groom had water during the dance party at the reception!! Brian is a talented AV master as he was able to put up the best ceiling decorations and was also really helpful with other coordination as well. Ed is definitely one of the best people we've worked with! He was so personable and friendly. We really enjoyed working with their team and the space itself is beautiful, large and well managed. Definitely recommend this space for a wedding or any other special event!   
  
Oh the dressing room is such a wonderful space! A small plus point to the already amazing venue!
