We had an amazing experience with Ali Besler in consulting and then booking Besler's for our 2020 wedding. She was incredibly welcoming and responsive to all of our questions and supplied us with a very helpful packet of information not only about Besler's, but other vendors and venues in the hills. We can't wait to have our family and friends out to experience the river and great green spaces and the rustic barn perfect for the reception.

The staff were extremely easy to work with and very accommodating. They have some decorations they let you use at no extra charge! We held our wedding at dusk and the large windows provided an amazing view of Pierre and Fort Pierre.

The Meadow Barn is the most beautiful wedding venue in the area! Right when you walk in your breathe is taken away by beauty. We could not have asked for a better venue for our reception and a host our ceremony outside next to the beautiful apple trees. The staff and Katie made our experience so wonderful. Katie always responded to our question and made the day run so smoothly. We had so many compliments about the venue and staff!

Hitch Studio has the pleasure of working with couples to plan their wedding and style their weddings. We get to know many vendors and Kallie and Tim are wonderful to work with! They are authentic individuals who are knowledgeable and experienced in the industry. They are more than accommodating and are sure to help in any way they can. The venue is beautiful, unique and and has character; perfect for a ceremony and reception! They setup the tables and chairs, and always have a staff member onsite for questions. I love The Canton Barn and recommend to anyone looking for a wonderful venue in the Sioux Falls area!

Where to start! On my check list of things that my reception venue needed to have, they checked all of them! Needed to have power for DJ/caterer check! Needed to have cell phone service, check! Enough parking so grandma doesn't have to walk far, check! Close to rapid and cebntral hills for easy travel for all guests, check! Tables and chairs at location, check! Fire place for S'mores, check! This place has it all! The owners were amazing to work with and answered my 1000 question with smiles on their faces. They worked with my crazy schedule. This was a perfect place to have a reception at!
