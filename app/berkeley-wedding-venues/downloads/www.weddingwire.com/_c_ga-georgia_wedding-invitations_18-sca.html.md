Mirror Mirror is right — their BEAUTIFUL work is such a true reflection of everything we had dreamed for our wedding day and more! I had some very grand, Pinterest-inspired ideas that I did not think we could make real and Donnine totally made it happen in a way that felt special like the inspiration but also authentic to us and (very important, wedding planning folks know) WITHIN OUR BUDGET! Before working with Mirror Mirror we had some roughly connected pieces and it’s truly night and day now of how unified the look and feel for our whole day feels. It truly does all work together to tell a story. The magic is in the details and they have all been executed perfectly! It has been such a treat to get to work with Donnine on bringing this to life and it took something I felt unsure about to one of the most exciting pieces of our day. I can’t thank her enough!! Donnine was so helpful in working with print vendors to answer tons of questions that were totally foreign. She took care of everything, from gathering print quotes to setting up print sizes, and more! I started working with Mirror Mirror after I already had a vision in mind. Donnine was so respectful and open to what I was dreaming of while also evolving and elevating it to a level I didn’t know we could reach. She knew what I was picturing before I even did!

Wedding Reviews: My name is Lyndsay & I’m a happy bride from July 2020! Kyle & I had a gorgeous day as we celebrated our intimate treehouse wedding that is unforgettable. All the LIL’ details made it even more special... And that’s why I’m reviewing Maren from Dreamweaver Calligraphy. Maren is a super woman of many talents! I originally met her as she painted murals on our wall at our home. I fell in love with her energy & spirit & professional turned to friends & professional! Maren made so many special gifts for our special day! She made a beautiful hand painted canvas invitation that we will forever hang on our wall, an adorable wedding chalkboard joining our families, plus an adorable Mrs. Polycranos jean-jacket that was perfect for pictures & real-life! She also wrote calligraphy for our vows on beautiful scrolls. I cannot express how creative, thoughtful, talented, & meticulous that Maren is. I highly recommend her for so many avenues of artistic needs, weddings, birthdays, businesses, etc. If you want the small details to achieve uniqueness... Hire Maren - You will only have your expectations superseded!

I can't say enough positive things about working with Sunny of Pistachio Hill Letterpress. Everything turned out beautifully done, the design so unique and appropriate for my daughters wedding. I still enjoy looking at the beautiful invitations, save a dates, menu cards, placecards and especially the fantastic programs,(I had to save some for great memory keeping!) All items were printed and delivered at the desired times necessary for our wedding timetable. Everyone commented on the invitation, how special they were and different. We had almost 100% turn out for the wedding which I think had something to do with our save and dates and interesting invitations. I would like to work with her again in the future for other stationary needs, she is the best!

I used Tigerlily for my wedding invitations, welcome box stickers and custom napkins. From the beginning Jessica was so responsive, helpful but never pushy for business. She knows her wedding etiquette and helps to make your invites exactly as you want them. I cannot recommend her enough, you get excellent quality invitations and other party supplies that you will love! Also they arrived so nicely packaged and organized. I found her through her Etsy shop and so glad I reached out and used her as a vendor. Would recommend her to anyone!

I was referred to Invitations, Galore & More by two of my best friends. Jeannie Hayes was a pleasure to work with & provided excellent, professional & prompt service. She sat patiently with my now husband & I to help select our perfect invitations. We told her what we were looking for & she pulled out binder after binder of options until we were happy with our final decision. We also purchased thank you cards, programs & stationary from Jeannie. Whenever I had questions or adjustments to our order - she was available by phone or email & worked diligently to ensure our order arrived exactly as we agreed upon. I've already recommended her to 5 friends!
