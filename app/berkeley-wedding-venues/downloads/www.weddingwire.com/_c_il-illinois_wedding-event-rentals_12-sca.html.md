Sydnie was so accommodating and so easy to work with! The best part was it was obvious that my dog loved her! My friends were calling her "the dog whisperer". Her prices were fair, and knowing my dog was well cared for and happy made it all worth it! I also use her as my regular furbaby sitter (photo below). I highly recommend her!

Odyssey Group was the perfect choice and would highly recommend them to anyone having an outdoor wedding. We had our ceremony and reception at my dad's home and didn't want all of our guests going in and out of his house all day and night, so Odyssey was recommended to us by a friend and I'm glad I made that phone call. Their customer service was excellent from first contact to delivery and pickup. We received so many compliments from our guests on how luxurious the facilities were. Thank you for helping make our day easier.

Working with Lottie Linens for our wedding was easy and the linens they provided were beautiful. I initially sent over pictures of our venue, the bridesmaids and groomsmen colors, and our flowers. Anne sent back a full mood board with suggested linens, which was awesome! We ended up picking the Ivory Domask pattern, which is one of the premium linens. They were so beautiful on the day. Lottie Linens were flexible on set-up – they showed up the day before to make sure linens were on tables for us to decorate. They showed up again at tear-down time to remove the linens. Anne also worked with us when we needed to change the quote to reflect our final guest count. Great service!

Super easy to work with and everything looked great. They delivered everything as scheduled, had a whole crew for set up, and were very communicative throughout the process. We really loved working with them and found them to be WAY more reasonably priced than other rental companies in the area. They didn’t have a “wedding tax”, which allowed us to actually get the look we wanted at a price we could afford.

We used Dave, and his amazing crew, from Blue Peak this past weekend for my daughter’s wedding. Dave is exceptional; consultative, reasonable and patient. His crew did a stellar job with set-up, and equally important, take down of the tents and bathrooms. Blue Peak is your answer if you’re looking for a tent for your event. Run don’t walk….you’ll be so happy.

The team at Hall's was super easy to work with! They were very flexible and accommodating with slight schedule changes. The chairs we rented for our wedding worked perfectly with the rest of the decor. Thanks, Hall's team!
