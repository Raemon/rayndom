I had the privilege to work with Abby and her team for my wedding and they were amazing. She helped with the entire wedding planning process and talked to all vendors. She stayed in communication with me at all times and kept me updated on the next steps. She was organized, well-versed in the industry, and above all respected my views and requests. During the day of coordination, her team helped to stay on schedule and had everything planned out from waking up to the end of the night. I couldn’t have done it with her. I’m truly grateful for all her hard work and everything her team did for me. Thank you so much, Abby, you are the best. I pray God bless your business and continue to elevate you. I will 100% recommend Abby and the D’exquisite team for all your planning and coordination needs. Looking forward to working with them again soon

Jennifer Rose Events was an absolute pleasure to work with. As a fellow wedding vendor, I worked with her in October, and she was incredibly organized, communicative, and always one step ahead. Everything ran smoothly, and it was clear how client-focused she is throughout the entire process. I’d happily work with her again and highly recommend her to any couple planning their wedding.

Dailey Forte Designs was hands down one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. From the very beginning, they were incredibly organized, responsive, and truly on top of everything. Their coordination, vendor recommendations, and timeline planning made the entire process feel so much easier. On the day of the wedding, they handled all the logistics seamlessly and stayed in constant communication with every vendor, which gave us so much peace of mind. What stood out the most was how smoothly the entire day flowed. The timeline was perfectly planned, nothing felt rushed, and we were able to fully enjoy every moment without worrying about what was happening behind the scenes. They made sure everything ran exactly as it should, and we felt completely taken care of. We are so grateful for their hard work, professionalism, and genuine care throughout the entire process. If you’re looking for a planning team that truly goes above and beyond, Dailey Forte Designs is the way to go.

As someone who knew close to nothing about weddings, I was expecting the wedding planning experience to be overwhelming and stressful. Until someone suggested we hire a day-of planner. RCC made the planning process simple, straightforward, and fun. In our meetings I remember laughing a lot and working as a team to make sure the day was catered to our wants and needs. Our wedding day was beautiful, thanks to RCC!

Charlene was very helpful throughout our planning process and had regular meetings with us to help keep us on track. The day of our wedding, our coordinator Tia was fantastic and so on top of everything! We didn’t have to worry about the timeline at all, everything ran smoothly and we could just enjoy our wedding. She was also able to make some adjustments to the timeline on the fly without any issue at all. We would definitely recommend Your Day Your Way!

Stephanie is the most amazing wedding coordinator! She truly helped my husband and I countless times throughout the wedding planning process by offering us helpful recommendations to include on the big day, putting together a seamless & efficient wedding timeline, and taking care of handing all the little details on the big day. There was no feeling of stress or worry when working with Stephanie, both in the lead up to the big day and on the big day itself. If you are a bride planning your wedding, or any event, I would highly recommend hiring Stephanie Day Events & Travel.

Justina and Noelle are amazing! They helped make my day run so smoothly! From the first phone call, the multiple in person meetings, and the wedding day, they made sure all of the details were perfect. Communication was very frequent. They helped me create a timeline and provided ideas I didn't even know I needed. This is a great duo for all of your wedding day needs. I highly recommend Weddings by Wives!

Jill was absolutely awesome!! She made my wedding planning a lot easier and helped me with my vision (which I had a hard time articulating). Jill was flexible, charismatic and a life saver! While all of Jill’s help leading up to the wedding was extremely helpful, Jill also made sure that all day of operations ran smoothly without me having to be involved at all. Jill - thanks so much for everything! If you are looking for wedding planning services, look no further! Highly recommended!!!!!
