Swan Harbor was Fantastic!

We had our wedding at Swan Harbor in late October 2022 and it was wonderful. Terri and Diane were extremely helpful, responsive, and kind throughout the entire planning process (and I had a lot of questions from beginning to end). The venue offers a beautiful sprawling space for small or large weddings, and the tent being included was an added bonus. We used both the front and back of the house for our cocktail hour and got married under the gorgeous tree overlooking the Bay. Another reason we loved Swan Harbor is that we felt like this venue offered us the ability to make our wedding truly unique and bring in aspects that we wouldn't have been able to do at an all-inclusive venue. There are trade-offs to this, as working with additional vendors and rental companies can add onto the budget and create for some additional challenges/coordination leading up to the big day, but it was important to us that we had a wedding that brought in different aspects of our relationship and families. We also really loved that we could add on hours to the day (for an additional cost that will be written into the contract). That allowed the guys to go earlier in the day to get ready and then have an extended reception, which often wasn't offered at other venues.   
  
All in all, we loved our experience with Terri and Diane and the rest of the Swan Harbor team, and would recommend this venue to friends and family in the future! They went above and beyond in making sure everything was squared away. Thank you for helping to make our vision for our big day become a reality!

Stunning backdrop for a wedding!

Can’t say enough good things about this venue! It is absolutely stunning and our guests are still calling to tell me how beautiful it was, two weeks later! Terri was extremely helpful and responsive, and they were as flexible as they could be with our requests! Made our day magical!

The Perfect Venue! 

I love this venue, it effortlessly created the perfect setting for our wedding! Terri and the entire staff are welcoming and friendly! Even when we had to postpone because of Covid - they were responsive and understanding! The air-conditioned farmhouse really sealed the deal because I knew my guests would be comfortable and have access to real bathrooms. And there are SO many places to get the perfect photos of your day! Would highly reccomend it!

Beautiful venue!

Great service.   
COVID prepared.   
Beautiful land. Well-maintained.   
Meets every style: Red barn, open green field, willow trees, soy/corn fields, garden, manor house for getting ready, outside tent for covered reception... It has it all.  
  
My day was absolutely beautiful!  
The staff was very responsive in the weeks leading up to the wedding and answered all of my Mom’s questions. Gave us great referrals for other vendors. Drove us down to the water in the golf cart. Helped keep us on schedule...  
  
Best staff & outdoor venue!

Most beautiful venue ever 

I have always loved Swan Harbor and was lucky enough to have our reception there! Beautiful bayside venue with a constant breeze to keep the tent cool!

Wonderful Tour!

My fiance and I went to tour Swan Harbor Farm and it is beautiful! The responsiveness was fast and we had all of our questions answered! Swan Harbor would have been a great choice if my fiance and I hadn't chosen to go with a destination wedding. Note for brides: The walk from the tent and building to the water would be rather far if you have elderly or disabled individuals at your wedding, however the view from the lawn is just as lovely and much closer to the reception area!

Thank you Swan Harbor!

Swan Harbor staff were so friendly and accommodating, they all ensured that our day went as planned. The venue itself is absolutely gorgeous, landscaping is thoroughly managed, and the house/ tent area set a vintage/timeless ambiance. Sophisticated yet charming, the view alone encompasses numerous willow trees, water/dock, well manicured lawn and an enormous Kentucky coffee tree. Our wedding was breathtakingly perfect, couldn't have asked for a better venue. My Husband and I want to thank you so much Swan Harbor! you made our day so special! From the golf cart rides to the water and back, to the friendly and most helpful staff.

Amazing and Beautiful!

Swan Harbor was so helpful from the first day we did a site visit. Terri was super responsive to all my questions and they even worked with me becaus I had a lot of rentals coming to the venue so the companies could all get there at the needed times. If you just look at the venue you will love the openness and beautiful views from all over! I am beyond excited this is the venue we used!

If you haven't seen Swan Harbor and met the folks who work at this place, you don't know what you're missing! The venue has it all... An absolutely beautiful ceremony area overlooking the Chesapeake Bay, manicured grounds, a topiary garden, a tented area to accommodate you and all of your guests, and they also have a manor for when you need its amenities. Once you go there, you'll easily find out why it's a place that Mix Masters looks forward to coming to every chance we get!

Swan Harbor is hands down, one of my favorite venues in Harford County! I dreamed of photographing here and after shooting my first wedding there in October 2016, I fell in love! Portrait sessions are a breeze here too and the staff/owners are incredibly hospitable. I love the regal and vintage aesthetic the manor house has, paired with the beautiful bay view from the gazebo/fishing pier.
