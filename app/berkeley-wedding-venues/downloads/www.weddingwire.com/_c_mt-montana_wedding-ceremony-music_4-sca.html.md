As a wedding planner, I work with a lot of musicians! Baerbel and Big Sky Strings are hands down the BEST I've found for Bozeman, Big Sky, and Livingston! They are kind, responsive, and have a massive repertoire of new and old songs! If you're looking for a unique experience for your guests and yourself, book Big Sky Strings!

Kassidy was the most elegant addition to our wedding. She was professional, very responsive, incredibly sweet, very talented, and even indulged my personal Taylor Swift requests (have you ever heard Sparks Fly on a cello?). I cannot recommend her enough for your musical needs. Kassidy, we love you! Thank you so much!

Tom Catmull's music is fabulous, fun and danceable for all ages! Everyone left our reception wanting more, and settling for a CD so that they could continue the fun at home. He played our 2 requests-- our first dance and the father-daughter dance -- PERFECTLY and then entertained us with his original and "borrowed" tunes for the rest of the night. He and his band are great, kind guys who were a joy to have with us that day.

Halladay has a beautiful voice and is a true musician who can interpret a song to fit her style. I hired Halladay to do our ceremony music and requested 5 songs for her to learn and play. She was happy to do this and, although I didn't get to hear everything because I was the bride and had to hide until my turn down the aisle, the songs I did hear were perfect. Just absolutely beautiful. She brought all her equipment and set up in a timely manner. She was dressed well and performed wonderfully. So many of our guests commented on how beautiful of a singer she was. I am so happy I was able to have her perform at our ceremony. It really set the perfect tone and was just beautiful. Thank you Halladay!

We hired the Eric Alan Duo (88 Keys to Happiness) for our wedding reception. Kelly and Eric played throughout our cocktail and dinner hour. They have an easy laid back sound which still allows you to mingle and talk to guest but also keeps your attention with songs you will want to sing along to. Everyone commented on our amazing band choice. We would have loved to listen to them sing and play piano all night! Kelly and Eric DJed for our wedding as well and helped play a predetermined song list for the final hour of our wedding. You will not regret choosing these two for your wedding as they are an easy crowd pleaser and awesome musicians.

I can't even begin to express how amazing Dave at Guitarborist is! My wedding day would not have been nearly as amazing without him. He took the time to get to know my and my fiancé and paid such close attention to details about us. He was so entertaining and professional. I have been receiving compliments about him even almost two years later! If you want your wedding day entertainment to go off without a hitch I highly recommend looking in to Dave Francis at Guitarborist!!!
