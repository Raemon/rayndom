I recently had the pleasure of working with Carey for an event, and I can’t recommend her highly enough! From the very start, she connected with me on a heartfelt level, ensuring that every aspect of the planning process reflected my vision and personality. Carey’s creativity shines through in her stunning decor and breathtaking tablescapes, which transformed the venue into something truly magical. Every detail was thoughtfully considered, leaving my guests in awe and creating an unforgettable atmosphere!What I appreciated most was how comfortable and at ease Carey made me feel throughout the entire process. It was clear that she genuinely cared about bringing my dreams to life, consistently going above and beyond to ensure that nothing was overlooked.If you’re looking for an event planner who combines creativity, attention to detail, and a genuine connection, Carey is the one for you! She has a remarkable talent for creating unique experiences that resonate with the heart. I can't wait to work with her again! 💖✨ #EventPlanning #CareyYourEventPlanner #UnforgettableEvents

Being from Maryland and doing a destination wedding in Montana, my husband & I were very nervous when it came to booking vendors we have never met. From the first interaction with Leann, she was so friendly, outgoing, and personable. We knew we would be in excellent hands from the moment we had our first meeting over zoom! Leann was always so responsive & one step ahead to ensure we would have the best wedding day. Not to mention, she was a gem that went above and beyond, letting us ship items to her since we were out of state. All of our guests (and most importantly us, the bride and groom) were able to take in every minute of the wedding day thanks to Leann! Would recommend her to ALL brides in Montana!!!

Joe went above and beyond to help plan our wedding. He was amazing at bringing out detail to life and supporting us each and every step along the way. Joe was someone who I relied on for every detail, small or large, and trusted his opinion. Not only was he amazing at communicating with me, but also every vendor. Joe made wedding planning stress free, fun, and easy! I would hire him to plan every single event in my life, if I could! Thank you for all you did, Joe! You truly are the best.

Hiring Chelsea as our full-service wedding planner was hands down the best decision we made for our wedding on September 19, 2025, at The Cabins at Blacktail in Lakeside, Montana. From the moment we started working with her—about 18 months out—we knew we were in the best possible hands. Chelsea is incredibly organized, reassuring, and direct in the best way. Throughout the entire planning process, she gave us thoughtful, invaluable advice on things we never would have even thought of on our own. She understood our vision immediately and helped bring it to life in a way that felt so true to us. At every step, she made the process feel manageable, exciting, and never overwhelming. On the wedding day itself, Chelsea and her team were nothing short of amazing. They started setup early, handled everything seamlessly, and quietly took care of any issues behind the scenes without ever letting it affect our experience. Because of her, we were able to stay calm, present, and fully soak in every moment of the day—something we’ll be forever grateful for. Knowing she was there allowed us to truly enjoy our wedding without stress or worry. What really sets Chelsea apart is how personal the experience felt. She wasn’t just our planner—she felt like a trusted friend who genuinely cared about us and our day. She kept us grounded, supported us emotionally, and always made sure we felt confident and taken care of. We truly cannot imagine our wedding without Chelsea. We would hire her again in a heartbeat, and we wholeheartedly recommend her to any couple looking for a planner who is professional, compassionate, detail-oriented, and truly exceptional at what she does. Our day was everything we dreamed of—and that’s because of her.

Sara was our wedding planner--and we could not be more thankful for her services! Initially, we weren't going to hire a planner. It turned out that we really did need one, and Sara did a great job filling that role. It was complicated for us to live and plan from Hawaii, be married in Montana, and have our family coming in from Maryland. Sara helped to pull everything together. She went above and beyond in many ways to ensure we got what we needed to the venue, and was where it needed to be, when it needed to be there, for our big day. She was communicative in the months leading up to our wedding, helping us feel good about our plans. Sara was organized and made her roles clear to us, so there was no confusion day of. We would defintely recommend Weddings by Sara!
