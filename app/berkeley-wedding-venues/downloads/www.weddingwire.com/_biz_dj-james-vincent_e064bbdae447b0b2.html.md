Best Wedding DJ in oahu!! 

My husband I chose DJ James to be our DJ for our wedding at Paliku Gardens this June! We already felt confident about our choice early on, but it was immediately confirmed when we attended an event December 2024, that he happened to be DJing as well! We provided a guideline of the types of songs and styles of music we enjoy, but also wanted to give him the freedom to select some pieces based on the vibe of the crowd! He did a great job and everyone was extremely satisfied!!! We have received so many compliments from our guests on our choice of vendors and would definitely recommend DJ James to anyone on Oahu in need of an engaging, fun, and talented DJ! -Taylor & Andrew

Congratulations! You found the DJ of your DREAMS.

James was fantastic to work with from start to finish. He was communicative, organized, and incredibly flexible with our requests, making the planning process so much easier. He had super straightforward instructions on how to submit our song choices and helped us with any questions along the way. On the day of the wedding, he exceeded all expectations—his song selections kept the dance floor packed, and guests couldn’t stop complimenting the music. He really knew how to read the room and create the perfect atmosphere. Beyond his talent, he’s just a great guy overall, and we’re so glad we chose him to be part of our special day. Highly recommended!

Thy 808 Wedding 

Man where do I start?! Needed a DJ after firing one, 1 week prior to wedding day july 2024. Hands down BEST DJ I’ve came across in my 29 years living. Mr. James Vincent really brought his A Game & knocked it out the park. My family is from the North Shore of Oahu, Kahana. They NEVER have experienced a DJ mash up of all genres of music. DJ James got taste, flavor, variety, culture and vibes. Most professional and responsible DJ hired to turn it up and shut it down.

Best DJ for your next event! 

We can’t thank Dj James enough! Our wedding planning was done in less than 3 months and Dj James was recommending to us through our planner. We weren’t picky and let him know our vibe and ideas and he executed our dream playlist for us. We loved his vibe and energy he kept our wedding flowing and knew exactly what music to play to get our guests dancing.

Best dj ever

DJ James Vincent did our wedding in June 2024 and he was the best DJ I have ever experienced. The music was so good we couldn't and didn't want to stop dancing. He is very talented and good at reading the crowd...the dance floor was legit never empty. He was hands down better than all the bar and concert DJs I have experienced and I would hire him again in a heart beat.

Best Ever!

I cannot say enough good things about DJ James! We hired him as our wedding DJ and we are so thankful we did because he made the atmosphere perfect at every step of the night. His music knowledge is unmatched, and he is so great at mixing songs together. All of our friends were asking for the playlist at the end of the night because it was so good!!

Had the perfect night with James Vincent as our wedding DJ! 

DJ James Vincent was exactly what we were looking for for our wedding DJ. My wife and I envisioned having an easy-going, overall just good vibes wedding to enjoy being around our close friends and family. After meeting DJ James and seeing his price, we felt very comfortable having him as our DJ.   
  
In the pre-wedding process, we very easily were able to share the requested songs we wanted and align on any final details before our big day. But besides our few requested songs, we wanted DJ James to take the reigns for the night and he did an outstanding job. I wasn't personally expecting everyone from our reception to get to the dance floor, but the vibes were that good! From the great music selection, articulate sound mixing, and being a great person to work with, you are getting a true professional with James Vincent as your DJ. Cannot recommend him enough!

The Perfect DJ Selection

From our first call with James we knew we made the right choice. He was responsive and flexible to make sure we felt great about the night. James read the crowd and knew which songs to play based off of that. He was great with introducing everyone as well as timing for when to start speeches, do our first dance, all of that. We have no regrets with having James as our DJ. Very satisfied!!

The best wedding DJ on Oahu

We were absolutely blown away by the service we received from DJ James. The wireless set up for our ceremony was perfect, his timing and pre-ceremony check in was perfect, the songs and energy he brought out to the dance floor. yep, perfect. I can not say enough good things about how DJ James made our special day a party to remember. There wasn't a minute that our dance floor didn't have a crowd on it. We asked for an even mixture of cumbias and 80s freestyle and boy did he deliver. As far as we, our family and our wedding party are concerned DJ James is the THE BEST DJ ON OAHU!   
  
Words cannot express how happy we are.

The real deal

We hired DJ James as our wedding DJ and we could not be any happier that we did! DJ James is fun, energetic and a true professional. He knows how to read a crowd and keep the energy and atmosphere lively.   
  
DJ James is so kind, humble and fun. He also MC’ed and made our wedding day so easy. He is accommodating and truly a pleasure to work with. Thank you DJ James! Our guests still rave about how fun and awesome our wedding was, notably the DJ behind it all!
