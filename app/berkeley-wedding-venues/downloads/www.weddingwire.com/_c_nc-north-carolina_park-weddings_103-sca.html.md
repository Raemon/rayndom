Whalehead was our dream venue. We hosted an 180 person outdoor wedding in May 2024 and we had the time of our lives! We got really lucky with temperate weather, had our ceremony on the Point outdoors, a perfect cocktail hour under the trees off the west porch of the building, and a massive dinner and dancing reception under a huge tent on the North Lawn with Corolla Light in the background. Whalehead was super accomodating and responsive throughout the entire process - big shoutout to Samantha Payne and Chris Hooper! They made sure we had all the permits we need and were so helpful as we worked to organize our various on site vendors for the big day. We had a few folks who required special care and transport and Chris and the golf cart were a wonderful addition to the day. We cannot wait to come back and renew our vows here someday or just visit and take some pictures :)

We had the best time as Basecamp. Everything was even better than expected. including the unbelievable from Summit Lodge. We loved Walking the private trails and spending time by the fire pit with Friends. Relaxing in the hot tub under the stars, was just what we needed.

Working with Danielle and the Alexander Homestead team made planning for a large event relatively simple. The team had vendor recommendations, checklists for decisions to make with simple “multiple choice” options so not to overwhelm me or the set-up team, and several free in-house rental items we could use for signage/décor. The weekend of the wedding, Danielle was an incredible resource for set up, directing family members, keeping everyone hydrated, and overall keeping the day running smoothly. She coordinated the catering, beverage, and outside vendor teams with confidence and ease, so I never felt like I was having to check in on anyone. The gardens were beautiful and well-maintained year-round, we were very relieved the weather cooperated for our big day so all the guests could enjoy the full space AH provided. Our guests had a great time and appreciated the flexibility to be inside or outside during the reception. As far as flexibility on the planning front, my advice to brides is to be aware of what is included and what is provided at an additional cost. Overall we had a great experience with AH and would recommend them.

We had our small wedding at Earth Sky Dwellings, and it was absolutely perfect! We were able to use most of the property for our guests to stay the night, which made the whole weekend feel extra special and relaxing.The space itself was beautiful, peaceful, and thoughtfully designed. Being able to use the provided wedding themes and decorations took so much pressure off of us and made everything run so smoothly. It was truly an unforgettable experience, and we couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate our day!

All I can say this venue is beautiful and is a nice place for a wedding or any kind of celebration. The owner and staff was on point and everyone was helpful on making sure everything was ready. The food was awesome especially the steak. The outside ceremony was beautiful from the flower garden to the butterflys that swarm around us. It was breath taking. Thanks again Mariani.

I was the event coordinator for my friend's big day, and the owner, Stephanie was an absolute Godsend. She was there early the day of the wedding and helped me set up every little thing, even helping me make the sangria for the guests. She stayed throughout the wedding and only left when she knew we had everything under control. She was kind and funny, and I was so, so grateful for her. I couldn't have pulled it off without her! Not only her, but the venue and the cabins were AMAZING! I stayed on sight for the weekend and felt right at home, the lightning bugs at night gave me such calming nostalgia, and everything was so cozy and thoughtfully put together. I cannot recommend this venue enough!

As Mother of the Bride, I feel my experiences will be as much important as the bride's, so I want to express how absolutely fantastic it was working with Jessie and her team. She was energetic, knowledgeable, extraordinarily helpful and quickly responsive to any and all questions we had throughout the entire process. The grounds are gorgeous, the home on the property so convenient and cozy! Proximity to Asheville is great - not so remote, but remote enough to be peaceful. I would wholeheartedly recommend Twisty Maple as a wedding venue that combines nature and elegance to create the perfect wedding setting.

We chose this venue for our recent wedding and I cannot say enough about how beautiful and charming this park is. Hidden away, you would never know it's even at the park. Would definitely recommend for anyone.
