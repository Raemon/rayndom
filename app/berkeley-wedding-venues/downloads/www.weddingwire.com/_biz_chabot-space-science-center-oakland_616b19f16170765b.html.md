An Unforgettable Evening

One of the first requirements for our wedding venue was to find a place that is truly unique and memorable. Chabot Space and Science Center checked all the boxes as both a fantastic backdrop for the ceremony as well as the reception. For our wedding, we booked the Astronomy Hall and Observatory Deck. What we truly liked about Astronomy Hall was that it was a perfect blank canvas for us to decorate and fill. The high ceilings added to the grandeur and the space fit our guest count perfectly. Working with the Chabot Team was fantastic as well, they provided onsite support during our event and worked closely with our coordinator and caterer which made the event go smoothly. Many of our guests enjoyed the night and mentioned how unique a venue Chabot Space and Science Center was and we’re very happy we decided to go with such an amazing venue.

Chabot was perfect! 

We loved having our wedding ceremony and reception at Chabot Space and Science Center. Rasheda was amazing to work with. She answered all my questions promptly and thoroughly during the entire planning process. The space itself was so unique and a huge hit for our guests. We have been getting consistent compliments from guests about the telescopes and how nice the observatory deck was overall. Thank you to Rasheda, Alex, and the entire Chabot staff for making our dream wedding happen!

The best venue your guests won’t forget!

Words can express how wonderful it was to have our wedding at Chabot! My husband and I were looking for a venue that was different than your traditional wedding location and Chabot was the perfect place. We booked the “Across the Universe” package which allowed us to have the ceremony in the Planetarium, cocktail hour upstairs & the reception in Astronomy Hall, 3 different places! We were in love with the idea that our guests could enjoy different settings all in the same location. The ability to customize the Planetarium in terms of lights, music & projections allowed us to really personalize the space. We got married October 7, 2023 and Chabot was able to project the sky from October 7, 2016, the day that we met which was super special! We had 150 guests and Astronomy Hall had the perfect amount of space where everyone had enough room to be comfortable to sit down but also move around and dance. We decided to go with their recommended vendors for wedding coordination (Simply Elegant by Diana), catering (Blue Heron), and lighting/DJ services (Verducci Event Productions) which really made the coordination process so easy! The Chabot team, Alex and Chelsea, are very organized and great to work with. They did an amazing job bringing our vision for the wedding to life and we are truly grateful for them! And because they are a non-profit, the rental cost of the venue goes back to fund the center, it was a no brainer for us to choose Chabot! If you’re looking for a unique and fun wedding venue, you will not regret picking the Chabot Space & Science Center!

Magical and Perfect

Chabot was absolutely incredible. We searched for cool wedding venues in Oakland, it was the first result to pop up, and we locked it in. The space is absolutely amazing and the guests loved being able to wander the exhibits and socialize, experience the Planetarium, dance around a rocket, and enjoy the general ambiance and magic (feedback is that it was the coolest wedding they had ever been to). The team, Rasheda, Chelsea, and Alex, were wonderful to work with. They were super communicative and organized, helped us stay on task, and were always available for questions from us and our wedding planner. The bonus is that the cost of the venue goes back into the STEM program for kids! If we had to do it all over again, we would 100% choose Chabot. It doesn’t get more magical than the wonders of space surrounded by a redwood forest.

A night to remember

We were so happy that we chose the Chabot for our wedding, we got so many comments from happy guests about how unique and memorable our wedding was. We chose to have our wedding indoors in the planetarium, but the Chabot also has outdoor spaces available and is surrounded by redwoods that make a beautiful backdrop for photos. The Chabot events team is AMAZING! They were super responsive throughout the entire planning process, and their recommended vendors list was a lifesaver. I can't recommend the Chabot enough!

Beautiful Oakland gem of a venue with an amazing staff

This venue was a great space for our needs/desires for our wedding: indoor/outdoor space, surrounded by nature but modern/accessible, lots of space for tables, bar, food, dancing, band...the staff was extremely organized, nice and professional. We planned this wedding from France and they were very helpful with everything that comes with planning an event from abroad. Our guests all raved about having access to the telescopes, and the volunteers made it that much more fascinating by going above and beyond with their explanations of what we were gazing at.

Wonderful team, unique venue, and fun for everyone!

Chabot was such a unique, fun space that our wedding guests of all ages enjoyed, and the events team there was excellent to work with from start to finish! As one might expect from the venue, the events team has wedding execution down to a science. Scheduling time with their team, touring the venue, and planning out details was all very easy and went smoothly. We also were able to rely on their team for vendor recommendations and timeline estimates to help with the planning process.  
  
Start time doesn’t have much wiggle room because it is an open museum, but there’s a ton of flexibility in other areas like where to have ceremony/reception, set up of tables, and even what you might want projected on the Planetarium! While the decor was flexible, too, we felt we didn’t need to spend much on this line item because of the museum’s exhibits and existing decor.  
  
Our guests had a fantastic time, with kids entertained throughout and adults having fun exploring too! Our ceremony was in the Planetarium complete with free show, we were able to set up our photobooth in front of starry skies for fun photos, and we lucked out with clear skies and views of Saturn and its rings through the telescopes!

Such a unique, wonderful venue! 

My husband and I are nerds, and when we visited Chabot for the first time, our imaginations ran wild with all of the cool things we could do with our wedding there. We chose Chabot as our venue, and we are so glad we did. Everyone at our wedding had a blast. We had so much fun, but so did our guests, and I’ve never seen kids enjoy a wedding so much. Afterwards we heard from our guests that it was the happiest/funnest/most unique wedding they’d ever been to. It was such a joy.   
  
We chose the Across the Universe package, which was great: getting married in the planetarium (thanks to Nicole for helping us with the planetarium A/V!), cocktail hour among the museum exhibits, and dinner and dancing in the Astronomy Hall. Our guests all loved the public telescope viewing, too.  
  
In addition to how cool the space itself is, the museum staff were great to work with. Samantha and Nicole were both friendly, and they were so helpful as we navigated changing COVID safety requirements on top of all of the usual wedding challenges. They were very communicative and worked well with all of our other vendors. We had a perfect wedding day, and a big part of that was working with such a rad venue.

If you want to create a highly entertaining, unique wedding, look no further. Chabot has so much to offer, from gorgeous sunsets, interactive science-y fun (including planetarium shows and telescope viewings) and incredible Bay Area views.... and let's not forget the free parking! They also offer stellar catering options (sorry for the pun, but it's true) so you and your guests will enjoy an amazing feast.
