The Oaks at Hooks Farm will always hold an incredibly special place in our hearts. We were honored to be the very first wedding ever held there, and the experience was truly unforgettable. From the moment we stepped onto the property, we knew it was something special. The setting is absolutely stunning, with beautiful oak trees, open space, and a peaceful, timeless feel that made our wedding day feel magical. Gail and her team were wonderful to work with and genuinely cared about making our day perfect. Even as their first wedding, everything felt thoughtful, intentional, and well-prepared. They were attentive, accommodating, and open to ideas, which made the planning process feel exciting rather than stressful. Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how beautiful the venue was, and we felt so lucky to be part of the beginning of what will clearly be an amazing wedding venue for many couples to come. We are so grateful to have trusted The Oaks at Hooks Farm with such an important day in our lives and would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone looking for a gorgeous, meaningful place to get married.

I can’t say enough kind things about this venue and its owner. They worked with us through the entire process and were willing to answer any questions we had at any time. I only wish we could have used the getting-ready suite all day, but we made it work. The grounds, the building, the location… it was all exactly what I wanted. I can’t recommend this vendor enough!

Amy Donahue and her staff were absolutely perfect making our Casino Night beyond our expectations. The Women’s Club hosted a Casino Night for a Cause raising money for 5 local Forsyth County Charities. Amy was a delight to work with always willing to help provide suggestions for other vendors such as casino table rentals, etc, helping to provide expertise on layout of the room and overall guidance for how the event could flow smoother. The staff was always so flexible with our team when we needed to adjust something before and during the event. The newly renovated ballroom was so beautiful with the new hardwood floors, new paint colors, and new wall sconces. The changes really make the room such a classy location for any event. The evening was such a beautiful night that our attendees were able to step outside to enjoy their drinks when they weren’t participating in our games or silent auction. Thanks for helping make our event such a success.

I cannot recommend the Payne Corley enough! The venue is all-inclusive, which made the entire planning process so much easier. They took care of everything: from coordination, delicious food offerings, in-house florist The Cottage Florals, and an included day-of coordinator (the amazing Bryana)- the planning was the easiest part of the whole wedding process for me. They made us feel completely supported every step of the way and had the best timely communication. The staff are so professional, kind, and organized. They even have the perfect on-site spot the Magnolia Cottage where we had rehearsal dinner. Seriously, they take care of everything and think of everything- even down to being provided brunch on wedding day!!!! What really sold it for me was no insane upcharges and no surprise fees. They are transparent with the extremely reasonable pricing from the start. You get the venue for a whole 12 hours (which if you look anywhere else you know this is amazing). I am Vietnamese American so having a traditional tea ceremony was important to me. Other venues only offered 4-6 hours max on site and additional fees for additional time… Unlike those places, I was able to get ready on site in the beautiful bridal suite, have a tea ceremony, and have the wedding ceremony with no issues. Our guests are still talking about how delicious the food was and how amazing the staff treated them. If I could, I would re-have my wedding again to experience it one more time here. If you're looking for a venue that takes the stress out of wedding planning and delivers a beautiful, seamless experience, have your wedding at the Payne Corley. I can guarantee that you will book a tour and not look elsewhere. (Bryana, Hope, and Michael are the best!)

My husband and I got married in October of 2025 and we are so happy that we got married at the Historic Dekalb Courthouse. It was so beautiful and perfect. Mallory was amazing and went above and beyond to help us. The courthouse is a perfect place to get married. The outside and inside are stunning and the perfect backdrop for photos. We love Decatur and this was the best venue ever for us.

We had an absolutely amazing experience at The Carl House. From start to finish, the staff was incredibly accommodating, kind, and attentive- not only to us, but to every single one of our guests. The venue itself is stunning, and we received nonstop compliments all night about how beautiful everything was. Our guests could not stop talking about how amazing the staff was and how delicious the food was. It truly exceeded expectations. A huge shoutout to Indira, our coordinator, who was absolutely AMAZING!! She made us feel so special and completely at ease, and she ensured the entire day flowed effortlessly. Her professionalism, warmth, and attention to detail made all the difference and allowed us to truly enjoy every moment. I genuinely miss that day and wish we could relive it. I would recommend The Carl House to anyone without hesitation. An unforgettable experience and hands down the best venue we could have chosen! 💕

The Classic Center was wonderful both Emily (wedding coordinator) and Meredith (catering consultant) were great to work with! Emily made sure that the whole day ran smoothly and I wasn't worried with one detail that day. It was wonderful how they prepared our food and drinks for us so that we could actually sneak some food in. It was so great to work with professionals who were there every step of the way to make sure I was not stressed that day!

Caroline did a great job of making the day easy for me! Rhodes Hall is absolutely gorgeous. I loved that I did not feel the need to add any decorations to the inside of the venue. I forgot to bring the few artificial flowers that I planned to tie to a few seats outside for the ceremony. The yard is gorgeous too, so there really was no need for any decor there either. The venue is reasonably priced and worth even more because of great staff like Caroline.

As a vendor, we love it when venues make it easy to create a great experience for guests, and Park Tavern does just that every time. We've had the pleasure of working multiple weddings at Park Tavern, Piedmont Room, and the Garden Tent, and the staff is always warm, professional, and incredibly accommodating. Most recently, we curated a Black & White Glam Booth for Taylor & Shannen’s wedding, and their family truly brought the energy. Such a fun night! 📸 -Luxe Booth Atlanta Team (Photo by Compass Films Productions; Photo Booth by Luxe Booth)

Fernbank is a beautiful venue! We had our first date there, and my fiancé proposed there, so it was incredible to round it all out with our wedding. The staff is communicative, friendly, and easy to work with. We actually had our point of contact change twice throughout the planning process, but each transition was quite smooth and didn’t lead to any bumps in the road for us. We’ve gotten so many compliments from guests about how cool our venue was. If you’re looking for something really unique, Fernbank is the place for you!

##  Hosting at a Gorgeous Atlanta Wedding Venue 

Atlanta is known for many things including, but not limited to, southern hospitality, sports, music, and housing the world's busiest airport. We're here to add something else to that list: wedding venues. Atlanta has a large selection of wedding locations to fit the needs of every couple. Here are a few things you should know before picking an Atlanta wedding venue. 

##  Popular Atlanta Wedding Venues & Prices 

As one of the original 13 colonies, Atlanta still maintains historical flair. The most popular wedding ceremony venues are manor houses and plantations. Fun fact: most of the historical wedding venues that are available today may not have existed before the Civil War after General Sherman burned the city to the ground. 

Other popular wedding venues include: gardens, houses of worship, and country clubs. If you and your fiancé(e) are looking for something more off the beaten path, consider a museum for your wedding venue. 

In Atlanta the average wedding price comes in at $27,620, which is about $2,000 below the national average. Don't worry if that's above or below your wedding budget. Each wedding is planned in a completely unique way. 

##  Travel and Hotel Accommodations 

As mentioned, Atlanta has the busiest airport in the world. It's the perfect location for short flights to major cities across the country. The best part is it's only about a 15 minute drive to wedding venues located in the center of the city. If your wedding location is in one of the many surrounding cities including, Alpharetta, Fayetteville, Marietta, Fairburn, or Decatur the drive may last anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. If your out-of-town guests are close enough to drive, Route 75 stretches from Tennessee to Florida. 

Out-of-town guests also need a place to stay for the duration of the wedding festivities. Preferably a place that is close to your ceremony venue and reception venue. In Atlanta, the average price for a night in a hotel is $108. When looking to accommodate a large number of guests we suggest looking into renting room blocks. To start your search, check out this [wedding hotel block](https://hotelblocks.weddingwire.com "Wedding Hotel Block") service. They will help you find the hotel rooms you need that are within your budget and near your wedding venue. 

##  Weather Considerations 

Atlanta is nestled in the foothills of the southern Appalachian Mountains, sitting atop the Chattahoochee River, which is a beautiful outdoor wedding location with plenty of water sports to entertain wedding guests. 

The city's interesting location on the Eastern Continental Divide as well as being close to the Gulf of Mexico, creates a warm, humid, and temperate climate. Atlanta has hot summers and mild winters, with little to no snow. That doesn't mean that snow is an impossibility so keep up to date on weather patterns around your wedding and check your wedding venue's policy on inclement weather. 

In Atlanta, the warm season lasts from late May to mid September with daily high temperatures around or above 80 degrees. If you're hosting a wedding at an outdoor or open air wedding venue, make sure you have ways for guests to get out of the heat. Giving fans as favors or having a misting tent can make your wedding a much more pleasant experience for everyone involved. You should also be aware of hurricane season as well as the summer thunderstorms. Summer weather can change by the minute, so have a backup plan for outdoor wedding venues. The most likely time to see rain is in July, which is also has the hottest days of the year, so consider booking wedding reception venues that are available in May or August, and September. 

The cold season lasts from the end of November to the end of February, with daily average high temperatures below 59 degrees. Outdoor wedding venues and activities are not completely out of question in Atlanta, but it's important for you and guests to be dressed appropriately. 

When you're starting your search for Atlanta wedding venues, look no further. WeddingWire has everything you need to find the perfect wedding location for your special day.
