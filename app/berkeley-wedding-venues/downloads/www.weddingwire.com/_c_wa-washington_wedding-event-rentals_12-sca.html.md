We rented wooden farm tables for our wedding, and they were absolutely perfect! The tables were large, sturdy, and beautifully crafted — exactly what we needed for our outdoor, woodsy venue. They added such a warm, rustic charm to the overall look and tied in seamlessly with the natural surroundings. Guests kept commenting on how lovely everything looked, and the tables definitely played a big part in that. Highly recommend for anyone wanting that blend of elegance and nature for their special day!

A huge THANK YOU to the Team at Kitsap Event Rentals!!! From start to finish they were absolutely phenomenal! Mike Bozinski gave wonderful suggestions on what to order. Mike suggested we didn't need to order such a large tent -- he was 100% correct AND saved us money! Additionally he had great suggestions about windows and walls in the tent. It was the perfect temperature and well lit! They were transparent about pricing and billing and even sent us reminders (thank you Sue!) The team that set up did a beautiful job. We could not be happier. Would absolutely suggest them to ANYONE looking for rentals. Professional, very affordable, excellent communication, flexible with scheduling and great products. Thank you again for making our day stress free and memorable!!!

We rented our linens and a few extra tables from them and it was easy! We were able to rent everything online and pay in full prior to the day of, which enabled my parents to pick everything up. I wish that delivery weren't so expensive- our rentals would have cost as much as the rental fee just for delivery, so we declined that service. Otherwise, very easy to work with and super friendly people!

They had everything I needed and it was all for a good price. All the towers and flowers I rented were in a great condition and looked beautiful!

Dean Allen was wonderful to work with from start to finish. He was on the catering list provided by our vendor (Laurel Creek Manor) and thus was very familiar with our venue. His team provided setup/takedown, linen ordering, bar service and dinner service. One of the best cost-saving things with Dean Allen is he lets you provide your own alcohol and his bartender will take care of the rest. So, we bought all our alcohol from Costco (and took back the unopened leftovers) which saved us a TON of money. Throughout the process, I noticed that Dean is very passionate about food and service and is in the business for the love of it. I am glad we chose to work with him and would highly recommend him to others. And oh yeah, THE FOOD WAS GREAT! And it was displayed beautifully- my guests loved everything (and me too!).

We got married at AXIS Pioneer Square, and had Prop Gallery provide cafe lights and drapes for the event. Our wedding would not have been the same without them! Not only was the finished product amazing, but the efficiency and professionalism with which they do their work was astounding. From receiving updated quotes (complete with example photos) while we were booking, to watching them set up at the venue day-of, we were completely amazed by Prop Gallery! It was so fun to see the venue transform in front of our eyes (and in a matter of minutes), from a cool but empty space, to a warm and inviting wedding! We are so grateful to Prop Gallery for helping to make our wedding amazing, and we recommend them so highly!
