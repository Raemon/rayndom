An Amazing Duo!!

Anand is not just an engaging speaker but an exceptional storyteller that captures your attention with such ease. Anand was the MC for the Sangeet and Reception at my wedding, each event including 300+ attendees across many different cultures and Indian sub-cultures. It is far from an easy task to keep such a large group captivated. However, Anand's ability to seamlessly transition between performances and speeches ensured that the events flowed smoothly. I have been to many Indian weddings, and few MCs have been able to keep the audience so connected in the way that Anand has such a natural talent for. The typical extraneous chatter was replaced with laughter and pure enjoyment at my wedding.  
  
What can I say about Dr. Srimix as a DJ that likely hasn't already been said -- not only is he's a human database of music, but a genuinely kind person. Srimix seamlessly blends genres and beats that keep you on the dance floor. He has a constant pulse on the vibe and, given his long-standing experience, understands the cultural and experiential music that is needed off the dance floor. Srimix is not just a DJ, he's one of the many partners you need throughout the wedding planning journey.   
  
I highly recommend both!

The dream team duo!

Anand and Sri are the dream team. At my son's wedding, we had a complicated timeline with a lot of moving parts, and I was stressed about how it would all come together. I shouldn't have worried. From the start, they ran the program so seamlessly that we didn't even notice if things were running behind. Everything just flowed perfectly thanks to their coordination. Anand is fantastic at managing the crowd—a comedic genius on the mic—he didn't just make announcements; he entertained the crowd and kept the energy high in a way I’ve never seen at a wedding before. Meanwhile, Dr. Srimix’s DJ set was fire! He played actual mixes and hidden gems instead of just the usual radio hits. If you want peace of mind and a packed dance floor, these are your guys. They’re simply in a league of their own. You might find cheaper options out there, but you will not find this level of quality and professionalism. They are worth every single penny.

My musical dream!

I needed a dj who could bring more than generic hype music for a multicultural and multilingual event, and Dr Srimix delivered. He was a fantastic DJ and an amazing guide through multiple Indian languages and stories, and truly blew us away! Anand was a great MC to get the crowd moving, and was funny exactly when he needed to be to give life to the crowd. Definitely a recommend
