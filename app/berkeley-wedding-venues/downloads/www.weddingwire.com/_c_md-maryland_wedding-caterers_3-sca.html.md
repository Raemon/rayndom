Chesapeake Celebrations is a great vendor. Not only did Kim and Kevin work with us with us within our budget, making recommendations as we talked about menu options but adding additional things that we hadn’t thought about. Their staff was amazing, very professional and went above and beyond. And where do I start on the food!! Our guests are still raving about the “restaurant” quality food that was served. It was delicious, from the appetizers to the main course. I would recommend them in a heartbeat!

Paula and her team are beyond perfection. They were so helpful picking out the linens (and so patient as I changed my mind multiple times!), they accommodated allergies and kids meals and answered so many wedding related questions along the way - food and non-food related! The food was a huge hit and people are still talking about it. The service was top notch! We will be heading back there for our anniversary every year!

After much review and research I selected Ken's Creative Kitchen of Annapolis, MD and it was the absolute right decision. We celebrated my son's long awaited wedding on Maryland's Eastern Shore this past July. Ken was an invaluable resource, being in the business for many years. The reviews I read and the photos I saw of his work were all stellar. He was accommodating, always available for questions and resources. The staff were 1st rate. The event went off perfectly. The food was delicious and there were rave reviews by the guests, the presentation was lovely, abundant & seasonal. I am so glad I trusted my instincts. I highly recommend Ken & his kitchen.

All I can say is WOW and THANK YOU!! Everything was spectacular. The food was superb and your crew was outstanding!!! Mich listened to every detail I mentioned to her before we went to the ceremony and implemented anything that I asked. She even packed my cooler of leftovers for me. I did not worry about a thing. We received many, many compliments about the food and your staff. The favorites mentioned were the London Broil, Scalloped Potatoes and the Champagne!! It was a pleasure working with you and your staff! Again, thank you from the bottom of our hearts for a job superbly done! ❤️

Beefalo Bobs catering was the perfect choice for our outdoor wedding venue? The food was spectacular as usual, and the guest thoroughly enjoyed their slice to order meats. The staff was very accommodating, polite, and super friendly. Many of the guests asked for references for their future events. Having the pit on site added to the already awesome venue. Dave Neall and his assistant went out of their way to service the wedding party and all the guests. It was easy to see why Beefalo Bob’s is one of the top caterer in the state. Thanks again!

Best company to go with in terms of food and warmth. Their owner is very hands on and was on site the night of the event. He was very helpful with any questions I had and very accommodating for food allergies that people in the wedding party and guests had. They set the tables with the tables clothes and napkins alternating colors exactly how I wanted them. They know how to get it done and they are so nice. I will be recommending they to everyone who needs a caterer for their wedding

It’s always a pleasure working alongside Palate Pleasers. Their team is professional, efficient, and incredibly mindful of shared spaces and event timelines, making every event day run smoothly. From load-in through breakdown, their communication and organization are greatly appreciated, and their attention to detail is evident in every aspect of their service. We truly value partnering with Palate Pleasers and look forward to many more successful events together. Highly recommend to couples and fellow vendors alike.
