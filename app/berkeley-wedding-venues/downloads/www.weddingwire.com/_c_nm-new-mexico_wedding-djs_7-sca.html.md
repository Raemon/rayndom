We really didn’t know what to expect with our DJ as we’d been to other weddings that seemed like the DJ could be a little hit or miss, but with Justin, it was a hit!! He did such a phenomenal job. Things got so hectic leading up to the wedding that we hadn’t had a chance to talk prior to our wedding. We filled out our online questionnaire/profile and just hoped for the best. Justin certainly delivered! The music was spot on, the transitions between different songs we requested, to particular covers of songs, he nailed it. We had many guests who had never done La Marcha before and we weren’t sure how it would go over, but he set it up perfectly. Our guests loved it and so did we! Hands down would book with Complete a billion times over!

Miles DJ'd a private community event where we had a particular genre we wanted. The music was great and fit perfectly with the scene, the food, the atmosphere. We will definitely hire him again.

Nathan from Too Hot to Stop was an amazing DJ and made our wedding so much fun! He was professional, easy to work with, and kept everything running smoothly. The music was perfect, the transitions were seamless, and the dance floor stayed packed all night. Our guests are still talking about how great the music was. We couldn’t have asked for a better DJ and highly recommend Nathan for any event!

We hired DJ Styles for our daughter’s wedding, and he was fantastic! From start to finish, he was professional, organized, and kept the energy high. The music was perfect for every part of the day, and the dance floor was full. He read the crowd well, took requests, and made everything flow smoothly. Our daughter and son-in-law had a great time, and so did we. Highly recommend for any wedding or special event!

We had our wedding in Evergreen, CO and was looking for a wedding DJ who would make our day absolutely unforgettable. We had some ties to King Mobile Music and knew they were the best. Brad was phenomenal from start to finish, he delivered way beyond our expectations and gave us the party of a lifetime. Brad was incredibly easy to work with, super communicative, and totally in tune with our vibe. He crafted the perfect soundtrack to every moment of our wedding, from the ceremony to cocktail hour, dinner, and the full-blown dance party that followed. The transitions were flawless, the song choices were spot on! And then Heather!!! Heather is the glue that holds the entire experience together. She was our day-of coordinator and behind-the-scenes MVP. Her attention to detail, calm presence, and ability to keep everything flowing smoothly was top notch and crucial especially with how crazy I felt preparing for the day. She made everything feel effortless, from managing our timeline to coordinating with other vendors and keeping everyone where they needed to be, without us having to worry about a thing. Honestly, we don’t know how we would have done it without her. Between Brad’s DJ talent and Heather’s coordination superpowers, King Mobile Music gave us the most beautiful fun wedding that we could ask for more. They are truly the best!! We love them so much!!

We would absolutely recommend them! They were super easy and fun to work with, and both us and our wedding guests had a great time. We had a lot of specific songs to be played at certain moments and Daniel got them all right. Tanya also did a fantastic job as emcee and kept the whole reception running smoothly. Loved having them be part of our special day!

Allen was a great addition to our wedding – we got many compliments on the music and although my husband and I were pulled away for photos for a good portion of the night, we know our guests had a blast! He was able to adjust his style to accommodate those who were dancing most (my aunt was very adamant about playing 80’s) without overdoing it and he was able to save a few of our requests for the end of the night when me and husband were finally able to join on the dance floor. My only wish was that we had coordinated a bit more in advance on our entrance: we went straight from the entrance to the first dance, so Allen started playing the dance song right away but I had to take off my veil, so we were a bit delayed in starting the dance but Allen handled it well by looping the intro of our song in a way that seemed pretty natural until we were ready to start our dance. I don’t think anyone else noticed, to be honest! He kept the vibe up all night and was very responsive via email during planning. We would definitely recommend Allen, as he had a great value for the price and even had lighting as an add-on to help our reception area look great! Thanks, Allen, we wish we could have spent more time on the dance floor with you, but we know our guests really loved it!
