I would gladly get married again just to have Assunta marry us. She was so attentive to detail and made the experience personal. She took out the guess work and worked with us to tailor the ceremony to us.

Dawn was super fun to work with. The process she has to tailor your wedding ceremony to each couple is so fun and it truly felt like ours was so personal. She is very friendly and helpful with any questions you may have regarding the marriage process. Everyone said how much they loved our ceremony and we did too! Thank you Dawn!!

Catherine gave us a wedding script template to edit and that was very helpful in our customization of our elopement ceromony. She was flexible and came early to walk through the formalities with us and did a great job being personal during the presentation that was photographed, videographed and streamed via FacebookLive.

We are so happy we chose Kezia to officiate our wedding! Kezia was absolutely wonderful to work with. She is thorough, extremely organized, and made the process of creating our ceremony as seamless as it possibly could be. The script she created for our ceremony was beautiful on its own, but her delivery is what truly made the ceremony so special. We had so many guests tell us that this was the best wedding ceremony they have ever attended. The ceremony covered our story so beautifully and everyone attending truly felt invested in our love and a part of the special day. We would highly recommend Kezia!

Dale was absolutely wonderful to work with as our wedding officiant. He was incredibly patient with me, (a bride who had many questions), and he always made us feel supported throughout the entire process. He’s warm, personable, and has a great sense of humor that really helped set a relaxed, joyful tone for our ceremony. He was also fantastic with our young nephews who were part of the wedding, which meant so much to us. We would highly recommend Dale to anyone looking for an officiant!

Working with Alan W. Ulrich has been an incredible experience from start to finish. He is professional, patient, and genuinely knowledgeable, the kind of person who makes complicated decisions feel clear and stress free. You can tell he cares about the people he works with. One of the biggest things I appreciated was his guidance during a very personal moment for us. My wife and I had a private wedding before our actual ceremony, and Alan helped us choose the perfect location to elope beforehand. That meant a lot he didn’t just handle paperwork and details, he helped us shape a memory we’ll carry with us for the rest of our life. His vision made that moment beautiful and special, and we’re genuinely grateful for that. Alan is reliable, kind, easy to communicate with, and someone we confidently trust. If you’re looking for someone who is not only professional but also thoughtful and attentive, Alan W. Ulrich is the person you want as an officiate.

It’s been one month since our wedding and every day I go back to how loved and supported I felt on the best day of my life. Michelle played such a major role in that. Everyone was asking us who are officiant was, and whether she was one of our aunts, because she came off like family so naturally. She made our ceremony seamless, personal, and funny. Scheduling the officiant was admittedly one of the more stressful parts of the planning. We were not doing it in a church, nor was there someone that both my husband and I were equally close to who we thought should play the role, so I worried about finding someone I did not know. But within the first phone call with Michelle, it felt like I had known her for years. She is warm, kind, supportive, and professional, and any couple would be lucky to have her. Thank you for everything Michelle!!

Nick Boas was amazing to work with for our wedding ceremony! He made the planning process so easy and met with us over zoom to review everything we wanted for the ceremony. He provided excellent suggestions and guidance in terms of developing the ceremony and in terms of the paperwork needed for the marriage to be legal. He was completely open to whatever type of ceremony we wanted and designed it to be exactly what we imagined. We loved that he provided us with the full script for the ceremony ahead of time (and even recorded a video to walk us through it) so we knew exactly what would be said and what we had to do during the ceremony. He was so accommodating with our rehearsal and made sure everyone knew where to go and what to do. We loved having Nick be part of such a special moment on the wedding day and would recommend him to anyone looking for an experienced and truly caring officiant. Thank you, Nick!
