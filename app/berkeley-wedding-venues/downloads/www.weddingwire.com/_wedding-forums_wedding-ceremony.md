Weddings are already so expensive, and I don’t want to spend hundreds just on background music. Is there a free way to handle it?

We booked our venue! I am so , I could scream! It is very beautiful, within budget. It was my first choice as well. My soon to be husband loves it as well. It has a pond that they can fish out off...

So, is using a vape at a wedding a big no-no or is it chill? I don’t want to be that guy, but also, I can’t go without it! What do you think?
