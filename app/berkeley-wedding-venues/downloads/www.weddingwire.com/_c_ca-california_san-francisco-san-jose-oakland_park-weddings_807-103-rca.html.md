We got married in late July at The Gardens at Heather Farm Park, and it was truly the most perfect day. This venue holds such a special place in our hearts. My husband asked me to be his girlfriend under the gazebo years ago, and later proposed under the same gazebo. Choosing to get married where it all began was a complete no-brainer. We had a ceremony-only wedding, and the gardens were absolutely breathtaking. Every flower was fully bloomed, the grounds were stunning, and the atmosphere felt magical. So many of our guests, especially those visiting from outside Walnut Creek and neighboring cities, could not stop complimenting the venue. Many even took time to wander the gardens and take their own photos because it was just that beautiful. I cannot say enough good things about Cathleen and the entire GHF team. They were incredible to work with and made everything feel seamless and stress-free. The weather was perfect, the venue was perfect, and honestly, everything was perfect. It was truly the best day of my life, and I will forever be grateful that we were able to say I do in such a meaningful and beautiful place.

Nestldown is truly the most magical place. Not only is it physically beautiful with the scenery, but there is a real sense of magic in the air that makes you feel like you’re in a fairytale. My husband and I toured Nestldown shortly after getting engaged, and didn’t need to tour any other venue after because we knew it was the one. We booked a minimony due to wanting a very intimate ceremony of 20 guests and it was absolutely perfect. We were so lucky to have Diana as our SEM, and she is a rockstar!! Her communication was consistent and she was always friendly and responded to questions quickly. Nestldown knows how to run any event seamlessly, and Diana ensured our day was absolutely perfect and ran smoother than I could have dreamed of! My only concern with a minimony was that it might feel rushed due to a shorter rental timeframe, but it couldn’t be further from the truth. It was the perfect length to have a first look, a 30 minute ceremony, family photos, additional photos of just the bride and groom, and all the special moments such as toasts and a Father of the Bride dance! Our guests and I felt it was a smooth schedule with ample time to socialize and take candid photos in the reception area! No one felt rushed at all and just kept commenting on how beautiful the venue was and how amazing Diana was! Diana not only made sure our wedding day was perfect and ran smoothly, but she also made our families feel special and cared for! She helped our family members with accessibility issues get to all areas of the wedding events and went above and beyond to make sure they were comfortable. All of the staff at Nestldown were friendly and helpful during our event as well as any time we visited for the planning process. We seriously cannot say enough wonderful things about Nestldown, Diana, and the team. It was the most perfect day and we are so grateful for everyone who helped give us live out our fairytale moment!

We reserved Hastings House for our wedding in early November 2024. It was a fantastic event thanks to Linda and her leadership, her marvelous garden, and the ambiance created by her husband Richard and his guitar. We got lucky with a gorgeous sunny day that brought out the best lighting for the garden ceremony and photos. Our family and friends were impressed with the whole experience. Linda helped us right from the start with a recommendation list that included Dave Medal Photography, La Costanera for the reception and Alena Jean for our florals. The few months of preparation and the day of events could not have gone any better and we cannot recommend Linda and her garden enough.

Most excellent wedding venue! My daughter and her husband had the most beautiful wedding on 9/2025 in Cathedral Oaks for 130 people. The venue was so perfect, the staff was extremely attentive, and food was fantastic . All our guests commented on what a fabulous wedding. Most important of all, the bride and groom were so happy! I most highly recommend this for a wedding venue. It is such a lovely place, surrounded by spring fed creeks, shade trees, and natural beauty! Thank you Saratoga Springs staff!

VRC helped accommodate us and our entire family when our original reception venue cancelled due to wildfires (we were married in September 2020)! We ended up doing an informal wedding ceremony and reception here. They were super flexible and obliging even though our very large group scheduled with them very last minute. We used all of the grounds (stayed the night before our wedding and the night after) and it was so beautiful! The venue is surrounded by nature - some woods and very close to the beach - but still had the comforts of a very spacious kitchen/dining, bathrooms, etc. The only issue we ran into was that there was no cell service - but we wanted an unplugged ceremony anyway. :)

We loved getting married at the Ruth Bancroft Garden! We got married there at the end of April when everything was in bloom in the garden and it was so so beautiful. The team was so nice and kind and super responsive. Tawny was so great to work with from booking the venue to the execution of the event and responded so kindly to all my questions. She has an amazing team and they also work to set up all the chairs and tables and stay on site for the whole event. She worked seamlessly with our coordinators, Contigo Events, to make sure the wedding ran smoothly! I found this venue to be very affordable compared to a lot of venues in the Bay Area and it was one of the most beautiful venues that me and my husband looked at. We were very picky and were looking for the perfect place to have a garden-y wedding where we could have a delicious meal outside in a beautiful location and we were so lucky to have found Ruth Bancroft! The garden feels so intimate, there are so many different nooks that you can explore, and so many cool plants. We had a 45 person wedding and it was just worked wonderfully. We also loved that we were able to bring in our own vendors -- we were able to save a lot of money on food and alcohol by having our event here. You do have to bring everything in yourself, except for tables and some miscellaneous furniture, but it was very worth it to us to customize our event and save money on food and bev that are usually even more marked up at all-in event centers. We 1000% recommend Ruth Bancroft Garden for your wedding venue. Such a beautiful garden and an amazing team!! We had no hiccups planning the wedding and our day went perfectly, we can't recommend them enough!

As a Wedding Videographer referrals are my preferred way to connect with future clients. Whether by photographer, planner or venue - It is the highest compliment! Whenever I see a referral from The Mountain Terrace I am delighted. It is a stunning venue and is the perfect mix of a variety of locations and a compact, accessible and comfortable venue. It is so well designed and offers beautiful views as well as cozy places for guests to enjoy. The locations for filming are gorgeous as well, between the redwood trees, sweeping views, expansive lawn and twinkle lights hanging from the white tent - the backdrops are perfect to capture the many sides of a Wedding Day. I am always impressed by the food and the professionalism of the staff. They care so much for their clients and guests experiences and have high standards that they hold for all the vendors as well as their staff. I always feel a part of a team which helps me serve my clients all the better! I am grateful to have built the relationship that I have with Caren, Anastasia, and Kristy and look forward to seeing more referrals in my inbox and having the opportunity to film at The Mountain Terrace many more times!

My wife and I hosted our wedding at Little Hills and it was a really great experience for us — and for our guests. From the venue tour all the way up through the wedding day, the Little Hills staff were clear and friendly when communicating, took time to listen and get to know us and what we wanted out of our wedding, and just generally very easy to work with. Little Hills Events can be quite flexible based on what you want, ranging from having food, beverage, and a lot of decorations available in-house to allowing outside vendors or BYO. The venue itself is beautiful, with multiple options for ceremony sites and a nice reception area that is tented but still feels fresh and part of the natural environment. Our wedding was in late May and the weather was lovely, with the hills still green and super pleasant temperatures. Overall we are so happy with our wedding and couldn’t imagine it being anywhere else!
