But even though your escort cards are first and foremost functional details, they don't have to be boring.

## Champagne Escort Card Wall 

Get the party going as soon as guests walk in the door by pairing your escort cards with glasses of bubbly! Champagne walls have been trending for a few years now, and truthfully, we can't get enough of them. Personalize yours with a neon sign, flowers, or colorful balloons. Of course this wedding escort card idea works for the 21-and-older crowd, so if you have any underage guests, be sure to swap out champagne for juice or sparkling water.
