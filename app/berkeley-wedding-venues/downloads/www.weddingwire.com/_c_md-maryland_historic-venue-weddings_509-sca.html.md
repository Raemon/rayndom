I just had my reception at The Grand Baltimore September 2023 and I cannot say enough good things. I will start with the venue coordinator, Nina, who was instrumental to the success of our day, and then move to the venue itself. The Grand was just the second venue we toured and we signed shortly after, so we had been working with Nina about a year and a half from contract date to wedding date. From day one, she went above and beyond to be as welcoming, patient, flexible, and transparent as possible to make our experience a better one. She went far beyond the expectations of her position to ensure that we were getting everything we wanted and needed, from letting us get ready at the venue when we had no other space, to making an extra entree just for us to try when we misread the menu for the tasting. Over that year and a half of countless email back and forth, late-night texts, meeting my family during several visits, Nina became a friend who was such a big part of the day. Now the venue itself can speak for itself just with pictures alone, but I will give a little extra. Like I said, we only toured two places before deciding on The Grand, but it's because there was no point seeing any more. After stepping foot into the building, we knew nothing else would compare. Built in the 1800s as the freemason's headquarters and boasting the most stunning stonework and architecture you'll see in the city, The Grand has not only the elegance I wanted, but the history and character of a building made to impress. It has multiple ballrooms, each with their own individual style to suit your event vibe. We were having a celestial wedding, so it was a no brainer to choose the Mirror Room for our reception, which had spectacular star-shaped light fixtures dotting a ceiling the color of the night sky. The adjacent room was used for our cocktail hour and looked like it came right out of a story book. People raved about the food and the day went off without a hitch. It is expensive, but you get so much for the price: attendants, bridal suite, amazing hors d'oeuvres, open bar, all tables/linens/cutlery, three course dinner, cake and coffee service. So yeah, it was a lot of money but I loved it so much I actually cut my guest list down just to be able to afford it and don't tell the people who got cut, but it was totally worth it and I'd do it again haha The wedding pictures I got from this venue, the memories I got for this venue, the friendships I made from this venue are priceless and beyond compare. 10/10 would get remarried here hahaha

We could not have imagined a more perfect wedding day than the one we had at The Belvedere. From start to finish, everything was truly exceptional. The ballrooms are absolutely stunning. They are grand, elegant, and full of historic charm that made our celebration feel so special. Our guests are still raving about how incredible the food was. Serving crab cakes in Baltimore is no small feat, and they absolutely nailed it! A huge thank you to Olivia, who made the entire planning process so much easier. She was knowledgeable, responsive, and genuinely invested in bringing our vision to life. And we can’t say enough good things about Harmony, our wedding day coordinator. She kept everything running smoothly and anticipated our needs before we even knew we had them. The entire staff went above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect. One of the most thoughtful gestures was when someone discreetly ran across the street to pick up my husband’s exact drink of choice without us even asking. Just one of many examples of how attentive and caring the team was throughout the day. If you are looking for a venue with beautiful spaces, incredible food, and a truly dedicated staff, look no further than The Belvedere. They made our wedding unforgettable.

We had our wedding at the Vandiver 12-6-25. The whole day was a dream! John and his team made everything run seamlessly and were so attentive to the bridal party as well as our guests. Made the day so much less stressful knowing I was in such great hands! Not one single complaint! I recommend it to everyone I talk to and guests are still raving about the venue !

Had a great experience having our wedding here - the venue itself is very beautiful and well located right downtown near the water. The food was a highlight for us - really very good and better than food usually served at weddings. There was some staff turnover with the wedding coordinator(s), but the managers Michelle and Matt stepped in to answer all of our questions beforehand and were there the day of to make sure everything ran smoothly, so we were very impressed to not feel any effects of the turnover.

Rockfield Manor was the perfect setting for our Halloween-inspired fall wedding. The venue is absolutely stunning, with a charming manor house, beautiful park surroundings, and a warm, inviting atmosphere. From our very first visit, Eileen and the Rockfield team made it clear they were there to support us every step of the way. When we unexpectedly needed a new day-of coordinator, Eileen went above and beyond by offering Rockfield’s in-house coordination services, which we cannot recommend enough. Her communication was excellent, and she was incredibly attentive throughout the entire process. One of the biggest advantages was being able to drop off our décor a few days early at the rehearsal, knowing Eileen and her staff would handle setup perfectly. They also assisted with packing up at the end of the night, which made things so much easier. We were especially grateful for how seamlessly Eileen worked with our other vendors, like Nicole from Crossroads Bistro. Everyone collaborated beautifully to keep the day on track and stress-free. Tip for future couples: Book the day-of coordination services through Rockfield. It is absolutely worth it for the peace of mind and the level of care you will receive.

We were so happy to find the Cloisters and immediately booked our wedding as soon as we were able to attend an open house and see the venue in person. Photos do not do it justice. It is so beautiful and unique, especially in this area. The perfect venue for any couple that loves anything historical, fantastical, or fairytale (which is us!). Staff were beyond friendly and easy to work with. There are so many beautiful spots to take great photos and a lovely area upstairs to get ready in (and take quick breaks when you need a breather). All our guests loved it and had a wonderful time, and so did we. Perfect for a medium-sized wedding especially.

London Town & Gardens was the perfect venue for our wedding! The grounds are beautiful and the backdrop for the ceremony is really stunning-- we couldn't have asked for anything more! Kristin was very helpful and responsive throughout our wedding process, always responding to questions/emails quickly and putting us at ease. Everything went smoothly day of, and we're so grateful the weather cooperated so we could take full advantage of the space and the views. Our guests raved about the views and the whole property! We couldn't recommend London Town more.
