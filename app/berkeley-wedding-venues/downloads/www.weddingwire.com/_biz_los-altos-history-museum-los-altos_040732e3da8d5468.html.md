A couple can celebrate outdoors in the courtyard, enjoying the gardens and picnic tables, or indoors in the main gallery.

Obsessed with LAHM and Lisa

The Los Altos History Museum was perfection. From the very beginning, the event manager Lisa was responsive, warm, and incredibly helpful in making our vision a reality. She worked seamlessly with our vendors to ensure the day ran smoothly, and her knowledge of wedding best practices and attention to detail were incredible. The museum itself is both beautiful and functional— the ability to flip the ceremony space into the reception (all with furniture rentals from the museum, another perk that was one less moving piece during the planning!) while our guests enjoyed cocktail hour in the back of the same property made for an easy, enjoyable guest experience. The twinkly lights over the lush greenery created a lovely backdrop, and our guests also loved the opportunity to check out the museum a bit too! With Lisa's guidance and enthusiasm, we were able to create an event that was stunning, unique and effortless for our guests, and an incredible value! We couldn't have asked for a better venue or better partner (again, s/o Lisa!) in planning our special day

A Seamless, Magical Day Thanks to Lisa

If you’re considering getting married at the Los Altos History Museum—do it, and make sure you work with Lisa. She made us feel taken care of in every way. When it looked like rain, she calmly walked us through backup options and made everything feel manageable. When we needed help, she had answers before we even finished the question.  
  
The most memorable part? She hand-crafted the golf-themed signage for our wedding. It was a masterpiece and became one of the most talked-about details of the entire night.  
  
Lisa made our day magical, personal, and seamless. We are forever grateful.

the wedding venue of our dreams 

Bride’s Perspective  
Our wedding at the Los Altos History Museum was a candlelit pizza party in the garden — casual, approachable, and elegant all at once. About 80 guests joined us for a joyful fall evening surrounded by trees, brick pathways, and twinkling candles & string lights.  
  
We held the ceremony under the large tree near the entrance. During cocktail hour, guests (especially those with kids) loved the docent-led tours of the historic house. For dinner, we sat everyone at two long banquet tables on the bricks, followed by dancing inside. Guests who stayed outdoors gathered around heaters and blankets we provided, creating a cozy, candlelit atmosphere.  
  
Because the garden is naturally so beautiful, we didn’t need much decoration — just some DIY Trader Joe’s flowers and lots of candles. When the sun set, the combination of candlelight and the venue’s string lights created a magical glow. My favorite moment was cutting the cake at one end of the tables and looking out at all our laughing guests illuminated by the flickering candles.  
  
Our mid-October wedding ended up being chillier than expected, but the heaters worked perfectly. The lights, warmth, and blankets made everything intimate and romantic.   
  
Before planning, I thought my dream venue would be a rustic barn, while my husband wanted something more elegant. The museum was the perfect balance — and even better than we imagined.  
  
Lisa, the venue manager, was wonderful from start to finish. She’s organized, calm, and incredibly professional. She answered questions promptly, helped with logistics, and coordinated beautifully with our vendors. Everything ran smoothly, and we couldn’t have asked for a better partner in planning.   
  
We joke that if we ever got married again, we’d do it all exactly the same way — same venue, same vendors.  
  
Groom’s Perspective  
We knew our venue search was over the moment we toured the Los Altos History Museum. Lisa not only manages a stunning property but also operates with transparent pricing and straightforward policies, which gave us freedom to design the event we wanted.  
  
The layout allows your event to flow naturally — ceremony under the trees, cocktails by the house, dinner on the bricks, and dancing inside. It feels private yet easy to access, and the gardens are perfect for photos. Watching the sun set over dinner while the candles and string lights took over was pure magic.  
  
Lisa was exceptional — responsive, flexible, and proactive. She met with our vendors in advance, made space for supplies, and was the first to arrive and last to leave. She even helped us pack our car at the end of the night.  
  
A few practical notes for other couples: there’s limited getting-ready space onsite (we used our house nearby, which worked great), tenting for rain can be expensive, and there’s no commercial kitchen. None of these were issues for us because Lisa communicated them early.

A little hidden gem in Los Altos 

The Los Altos History Museum is one of my favorite venues to work at! It’s a little hidden gem in Los Altos — the gardens and courtyard are naturally beautiful and offer endless photo opportunities. It’s perfect for couples who love an outdoor celebration with a relaxed, elegant vibe. It’s always such a pleasure to work with Lisa — she’s so kind, helpful, and truly makes the planning process seamless. Every wedding I’ve planned here feels timeless and full of charm, and we can’t wait for all our upcoming weddings here!

Our magical LAHM wedding

The Los Altos History Museum was the perfect venue for our wedding. From the moment we first reached out, Lisa was friendly, empathetic and incredibly responsive, making us feel special throughout the planning process. (She even recommended other great vendors like an EPIC churro guy!) The space itself is beautifully decorated and landscaped with a warm, welcoming feel that set the perfect scene for our ceremony and reception. Lisa ensured everything ran smoothly so we could fully enjoy our special day. We couldn't recommend this hidden gem enough - not only is the venue stunning, but we knew our money was going towards a wonderful community organization that puts on great programming. Our guests are still talking about how beautiful and unforgettable the museum was!

Wonderful Wedding Venue with Exceptional Support

We had a blast hosting our wedding reception here. Lisa was very helpful from the very first day where she toured the grounds with us, answered all of our questions, and helped us make the right decision for us. Throughout the process Lisa communicated with us and updated us as the day got closer. The week of, she was very attentive, very helpful, and accommodating, all of which are very helpful as the day approaches. On the day of, she was there, all the way to the end of the wedding, which was very nice. So many things are happening that day, and knowing she was working hard in the background, did not go unnoticed!! She helped keep our evening running smoothly and allowed us to enjoy the night. I would HIGHLY recommend this venue for anyone looking for a venue. It is a beautiful place, that honestly doesn't need much decor as the foliage and setting speak for themselves. Thank you Lisa and LAHM for making our night one that we will never forget!

Summer Garden Wedding

We were married at the Los Altos History Museum on a Sunday evening in June, 2025. The venue was perfect, with gardens in bloom, a beautiful courtyard, plenty of space for cocktail hour, dinner, dancing, and so many great sites for photographs around the Museum grounds and exhibits.   
We had the museum at the top of a short list before we went to visit, hoping for an outdoor venue for a wedding with a family reunion feel. We were blending a large multi-generational family with roots on the East and West Coasts, and the museum grounds feel like a perfect blend of New England and California summertime, with a brick courtyard, large heritage oaks, and historic buildings. The secret gift in booking the venue, though, was Lisa Porter, the Museum’s Event Coordinator. Lisa was responsive, professional, knowledgeable about every detail we could think of, and had so much helpful advice at every step of the planning process. She worked exceptionally well with our vendors and made it easy for them to get information and support whenever they needed it. She was present through rehearsal and event; she told us when we first met that she would be the first person to arrive and the last person to leave, available for whatever might come up.   
It was just beautiful at night; perfect for a summer evening wedding, and the “golden hour” glow is gorgeous in the photos. We held cocktail hour, dinner, toasts, and first dances outside, then moved the dance party indoors. We had 150 guests; there was plenty of space for everyone who wanted to dance, and the weather at night was still comfortable outside between dances for talking and mingling.   
We are so glad we had our wedding at LAHM; the setting was perfect, and Lisa made sure our plans came together just right.

Corporate Team Building Event - 10/10!!

We had such a great experience hosting our corporate team-building event for ~60 people at the Los Altos History Museum! The venue is beautiful — we used both the full courtyard and the galleries, and it worked perfectly for our day.  
  
Our event had a few moving parts, including a scavenger hunt, full catering for breakfast and lunch, and even a magician/mentalist — and the space handled it all seamlessly. The amenities were super convenient too. We had a shuttle drop off team members, and those who drove had no issues finding parking.  
  
Lisa was amazing to work with. She was responsive, helpful, and incredibly accommodating — from the early setup to coordinating all the logistics. Our team had a great time, and the smooth transition between indoor and outdoor spaces made the whole experience feel effortless. We also selected Heirloom from their approved vendor list, and the combination was smoother than I could have even dreamed!  
  
Would definitely recommend for events — both personal and corporate!

Beautiful romantic venue for a reception!

We recently held our wedding reception at the Los Altos History Museum, and it was truly PERFECT!  
  
The venue itself is simply gorgeous. We started out with cocktail hour in a beautiful shady area of the property where guests could mingle and enjoy the beautiful landscape & architecture. Our reception was held on the main patio, which was spacious & allowed us to very comfortably host almost 200 guests. The bistro lighting, surrounding trees, barn-like buildings, & pergolas made the space so romantic - with the natural beauty of the venue, no additional florals were needed. There is also a perfectly sized indoor area for dancing. On top of that, the venue offers a ton of flexibility - we were able to bring food trucks & food stands to the venue, and there are few venues in the Bay Area that would allow that!  
  
The location itself is ideal. Parking is plentiful; and while the museum is very close to downtown Los Altos and I280, it feels so isolated & private - perfect for a wedding reception!  
  
The secret to hosting the perfect event at Los Altos History Museum is LisaP, the event planner at the museum. Lisa is AMAZING - she is incredibly responsive, so organized, and has a true "can do" mindset. From the start, it was clear that she was committed to helping us make our vision for our wedding reception come true! We were taking an unconventional approach by bringing food trucks & food stalls to LAHM - and Lisa helped us brainstorm ideas & ways to make everything work. She answered all of our questions promptly, and with such a positive attitude - we couldn't have pulled off our reception without the help of Lisa!  
  
The Los Altos History Museum is a true gem & the ideal venue for wedding reception or any special event. We highly recommend it for any event where you want to wow guests in a beautiful & romantic setting - your guests will be impressed, and you'll get the benefit of working with a true event planning wiz in Lisa!

Lovely Spring Wedding Venue

We had our wedding at the LAHM in the spring - wonderful location, lots of space for decorations, tables, etc! Venue comes with string lights, which was nice once the sun started setting. Lisa was super helpful and accommodating. Really beautiful courtyard and garden space, it gave us the cozy backyard feeling without the hassle of actually planning something at home. The museum exhibits were also very charming. They offered more flexibility than other big wedding venues, though there is still a list of preferred vendors. The terms were pretty transparent - no big hoops to jump through or navigate. Spacious parking, just keep in mind time constraints for your event. Overall, we loved having our wedding here and would recommend!
