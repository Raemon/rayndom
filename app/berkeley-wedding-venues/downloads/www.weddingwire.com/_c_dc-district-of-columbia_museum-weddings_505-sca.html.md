Getting married in Old Town Alexandria was truly a dream, and Torpedo Factory Art Center (TFAC) was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding. The location is incredible, full of charm and history, and created such a special atmosphere for our day. From our very first email, Deri was amazing to work with. She gave us a thorough tour of the venue and provided a helpful list of recommended vendors, which made planning so much easier. Throughout the entire process, she was incredibly supportive. She even took the time to meet with a vendor who was new to the venue, ensuring everything went smoothly. The venue itself is extremely flexible and can truly accommodate any type of event. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience and highly recommend TFAC to any couple looking for a beautiful, historic, and well-supported wedding location.

We had a great experience having our Friday night Shabbat dinner before our wedding at the Capital Jewish Museum. It was such a special space and all of our guests loved it. Michelle was awesome to work with and made sure we had everything we needed for our event. Highly recommend booking CJM for your event!

Gunston Hall is absolutely gorgeous, from historic architecture to the beautiful gardens and foliage. We found that Gunston was a great option for us in the NoVA area especially because there a lot of options for how to use the space and the price is so phenomenal compared to similar venues in the area. Truly, though, the best part of having Gunston as our wedding venue was working with Nicole, who manages events at the venue. Nicole was a sweetheart and such a lovely person to work with. My husband and I had a long engagement AND had to have a COVID reschedule, so I had plenty of questions and changes over time. Nicole went above and beyond as a contact and resource to me throughout the time we were planning. She was always communicative, extremely flexible, and so so kind. It was a great experience, and I secretly wish I could work with Nicole more in the future! Definitely recommend.

We had the most amazing experience having our wedding at the Spy Museum! The views are incredible, the location is unbeatable, and the space itself feels modern and elegant. Our guests were excited and impressed by the venue and it set the stage for a great event. All were impressed with the rooftop views and location. The staff made everything easy, and having the Hilton right next door was perfect for our guests and for us to get ready. It’s also convenient to the airport and metro, which made travel stress-free. We held our ceremony on the rooftop, cocktail hour in the ballroom, and the reception back on the rooftop, which gave us a perfect indoor/outdoor flow without having to worry about weather. Spilled Milk Catering was fantastic and clearly knew the venue inside and out, which gave us total peace of mind. From the venue and views to the staff and catering, everything exceeded our expectations — highly recommend!

We were so proud to host our event at VisArts. We were able to have our wedding on the roof, cocktail hour in the concourse, and reception in the Buchanan Room for our 138 person event in late March 2025. Mary was a dream to work with – she is hardworking, incredibly creative, and accommodating. She was onsite all day for our wedding, and even took an 8:30pm call in advance of the day to make sure we felt comfortable and ready. We had a few unique requests for the paper lanterns, uplighting, layout, and vendor delivery that VisArts accommodated and executed seamlessly. I couldn’t recommend this venue more.

The venue is stunning and the whole team was fantastic to work with. Very responsive, worked great with us and our planners. We loved having the cocktail hour in the 3rd floor gallery. Dinner on the mezzanine with dancing on the ground floor worked super well. Absolutely loved it!

The staff at MSV was friendly and extremely helpful leading up to our big day and on our actual wedding day. Catherine was very patient and answered ALL of my questions...and I had a lot. On the day of our ceremony, everything was smooth. My bridal party and I had our own separate space to get ready prior to the ceremony as did my Groom and his groomsmen so we were able to remain separated prior to walking down the aisle. The ceremony was held in the Grand Allee and was stunning. But, the Grand Allee wasn't the only beautiful spot at the museum. We made sure that we had plenty of time after the ceremony so my Groom and I could have pictures taken throughout the gardens. My Groom and I can't wait to celebrate future anniversaries with a trip back to Winchester. Of course, when we visit, we will walk through the gardens at the Museum of Shenandoah Valley!

Riverdale House Museum was a natural choice for my husband and I as we live only a block away BUT I couldn't have picked a better venue. It's truly a "hidden gem" that not many know about and was not only a beautiful ceremony (we had ours out back on the porch) and reception (in the ballroom), but they also provide house tours which was very unique and the guests loved it. The staff is extremely helpful and enthusiastic, providing tables, chairs, gift table, and set them all up as part of the venue fee. You can't go wrong with Riversdale!
