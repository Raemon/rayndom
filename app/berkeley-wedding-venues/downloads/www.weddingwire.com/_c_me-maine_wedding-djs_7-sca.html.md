Mike was very friendly, and did a great job working with our wishes. He was professional, and our Zoom meetings with him were very helpful in putting our minds at ease and making sure everything was set in place. The music was spot on, everyone had a great time on the dance floor! Definitely worth every penny.

I have hired many DJs in my lifetime for both private and corporate events and we hired DJ Dave Smith for our daughter’s wedding and he was outstanding. You could not ask for more from a DJ. He carried out everything we asked for, and it was done with the utmost professionalism. Hire him you will not be disappointed.

Barbra was lovely to work with! Our families are not dancers but she had almost everyone on the dance floor. The music for our ceremony, announcement, and first dance were perfectly cued and set up. She was great on the mic when needed but kept the focus on our guests and the music. Barbra showed us exactly what she was thinking for cocktail hour and pre-ceremony in advance, and welcomed suggestions to modify her playlists to make sure we loved the music. Everything went smoothly, with no technical difficulties - the evening was perfect!

If you are reading this review, you have found your wedding DJ. From the very start, Sean was incredibly knowledgable and responsive to all of our communication. His portal makes wedding planning so easy and removes a lot of the stress. Sean was a pro at reading the room and nailing the coolest transitions between songs. Our dance floor was packed all night. He had the perfect balance of calm energy when guiding us through events during our day and infectious joy when DJing our reception. Truly could not imagine our day without Sean. He is a top tier wedding vendor!

Mixed Up DJ (Shawn) were great; the song selections kept our guests entertained, dancing, and moving all night long. Shawn's light show was fantastic, added a lot to our event. And the price was great. Highly recommend them.

DJ Claude was absolutely phenomenal! All of our guests raved about him, with many saying that every song he played was a hit. He matched our vibe perfectly and nailed every transition. Would definitely recommend hiring him!

We cannot recommend Adam enough!! He was accommodating, flexible, creative, etc. He helped us with the decision making process, helped with a concrete timeline and made sure everything was on schedule. Even accommodated last minute adjustments. We would suggest him for any event and we had many guests compliment the music choices (we put full trust in him and only really recommend a few songs)!!

We had Ed for our wedding and we highly recommend him!! You can tell how much he loves what he does, and it’s not just a job for him. He was attentive to what we wanted and really listened to us. The music was spot on, and he went above and beyond to make our day go as smooth as possible.

Brian was recommended to us through our photographer, and did an outstanding job from start to finish helping to make the vision for our special day come to life! He has an easy-to-use online portal for song requests, and is very responsive to emails and calls with questions. Brian really "got" the eclectic mix of music and specific vibe we were going for, and even went out of his way to create some special song mixes. He was enthusiastic, professional, flexible, and did an incredible job of keeping the party going throughout our reception, easily reading the crowd and getting everyone dancing. Many guests have commented that it was one of the most fun weddings they have ever attended. We were looking for a DJ that would set a professional and upbeat tone without being overbearing or "cheesy", and Brian definitely fit the bill. Top notch and highly recommended!
