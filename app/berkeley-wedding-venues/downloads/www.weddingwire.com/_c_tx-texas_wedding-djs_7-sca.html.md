Some companies just know what they are doing. They know how to take care of people and it has nothing to do with money. This comes from caring and understanding that the more service you give the more money you make. My family enjoyed not only the music but the photo booth and the matrix video camera. I look forward to hiring them again for ANY event in the future. Thank you for taking care of my family and making it a truly wonderful event.

We cannot say enough about how much we loved working with Rosa Gibson. As a very busy working professional living in a different state, Rosa was a life-saver for my Austin wedding. She tailored her wedding packages to our specific needs instead of nickel and diming for every charge, knew the perfect vendors to book for our wedding, and got us a ton of vendor discounts. She was extremely organized, very thorough in her planning, and when any small thing popped up she took care of it immediately and effectively. Picking Rosa was the best choice I made when planning my wedding, because she helped me make all the other choices to make our wedding awesome!

We had a great experience with Monte! He helped us plan the flow of the entire reception and got everything on track during the evening. He definitely tailored the themes and music for our event and made the night memorable.

We couldn’t have asked for a better DJ for our wedding! From the very first conversation, He was extremely professional, attentive, and genuinely invested in creating the perfect soundtrack for our day. Tom made the entire planning process feel effortless — listening to our preferences, communicating thoroughly, and making sure every detail was covered. On the wedding day, they absolutely nailed it. The ceremony music was timed perfectly, the cocktail hour had the exact vibe we wanted, and once the reception started… the dance floor was packed. So many of our guests told us it was the most fun they’ve ever had at a wedding, and we know that Tom played a huge role in that. What truly stood out was their professionalism and presence — friendly, smooth transitions, great announcements, zero stress. They created a seamless flow and made the entire evening feel magical. If you want a DJ who understands how to set the tone, keep your guests dancing, and make your day unforgettable, look no further. Hiring Tom was one of the best decisions we made!

We hired It’s Your Night entertainment and Ben Honeycutt to play a live set and DJ/MC our daughter’s recent wedding reception at The Hillside Estate. From the initial inquiry/quote to the big day, they were professional, responsive, and fantastic to work with. Ben Honeycutt is just a phenomenal talent - WOW!! He learned and played our special dance songs and also played throughout dinner. Then he switched it to DJ mode and the dance floor stayed packed all night! I am still getting calls and texts from friends asking about Ben because he was that good! I highly recommend It’s Your Night and Ben Honeycutt!

Sean was the DJ for our wedding, and he was absolutely AMAZING! Not only did he show up on our wedding day and deliver absolute bangers all night long, but he also checked in with us multiple times throughout the planning process to make sure everything was on track. He offered so many great suggestions—like kicking off the reception with a group photo—and that picture is something I will cherish forever. He knew exactly how to engage with our guests and kept people on the dance floor the entire night. We couldn’t have asked for a better DJ!

Jesse was the absolute perfect DJ for our wedding! He brought the exact energy we were looking for, was communicative and respectful (asking the correct pronunciation of last names and ensuring the timeline was followed perfectly), and was just an absolute delight to work with. Our dance floor was popping from the moment it opened- and never died down! We really wanted a party on our dance floor and that is exactly what we got. Throughout the booking process Jesse and the Byrne Rock team were so informative, kind, and thorough. He really made our night special, and we couldn’t recommend more strongly to anyone that they should hire him to DJ for whatever occasion they have!
