Leah worked with everything the wife and I were wanting. Our first meeting, she brought several books to help structure the ceremony. After Leah created the script, we were able to sit down with her and add or take away anything we wanted. Leah created a beautiful cord for how handfasting ceremony. Leah helped make our wedding our own and was a HUGE factor of it being so beautiful. We were lucky to have met her.

Denise was exceptional! She is a very organized & efficient person. She didn’t rush the ceremony but kept us on schedule for rehearsal & for the ceremony. We started on time! During the ceremony when the photographers were taking pictures, she knew when to step back to the perfect shot of the groom & bride. I feel like she truly cared & wanted it to be the perfect day for the bride & groom but also for the friends & family. Her voice is also very audible. I couldn’t be more happy with how the ceremony turned out.

Shirley recently married my husband and I. We never met her until the day of the rehearsal and only dealt with her over emails but even with just that we knew we loved her from the rehearsal. She was exactly what we wanted and the price was right too. We had an issue with a cousin's little boy and I saw her giving him candy to calm him down. I'm so glad we chose her to marry us.

Rev. Patricia Cassinelli was the officiant for my wedding, and she was wonderful. Willing to work with us to make sure the ceremony was truly reflective of what we wanted and who we were as a couple. Took time to get to know us as a couple and learn our values. We had so many compliments on using her from our wedding guests and all remarked that it was a unique and meaningful ceremony. She also did a fantastic job at rehearsal and made a point to get to know our wedding party and family members.

Molly did a wonderful job! She was easy to communicate with and had no problem using the script that I pieced together. She braved the cold weather during rehearsal and her suggestions along the way were great. The day of the wedding she did a good job of talking loud since the microphones didn't work at our outdoor ceremony. Highly recommend her!
