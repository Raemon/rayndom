I might be bias, but Salisbury House & Gardens is one of the pretties venues in the Des Moines area. Because of this, my husband and I didn't have to go overboard with decorations, the space took care of providing an amazing experience all on its own. Depending on your headcount there are a variety of spaces you use utilize onsite, allowing you and your fiancé to layout your event exactly as you envision. We also loved this venue because of its proximity to downtown. We had our ceremony and our hotel blocks downtown then had shuttles bus out to the venue which is only about 10 minutes. To top it off, the staff at Salisbury were very responsive and extremely helpful throughout the entire process. I would highly recommend this venue to anyone getting married in the Des Moines area!

I knew I wanted a rustic, barn themed wedding and the stable was the perfect location! It was really beautiful with all our decor and the beams wrapped with lights. The beams did make it a struggle to set up tables but we made it work. The only real issue was there was no PA system to connect the downstairs, upstairs, and outside for our guests to hear announcements and the music.

Bash is such an amazing building to begin with! Catherine manages to turn it into the most beautiful facility to host a wedding in and she utilizes the space perfectly. Catherine was so much fun and so pleasant to work with! We highly recommend choosing Bash for your venue! Catherine has the best set up and package for all of the venues that we researched and chose! Our wedding was a dream come true and was even better than we ever imagined it would be! We received constant compliments about how amazing our venue was and how beautiful! Thank you to Catherine at Bash and all of her crew for making such a wonderful night possible for us! We are so grateful and happy!

We would recommend The Tea Room to anyone! Their staff were amazing, responsive, and just lovely people. They always had an answer to our questions and took so much stress away from us! Sarah and Maddie were a joy to work with. The Tea Room is the most gorgeous venue in Des Moines with stunning windows and amazing views. We are so glad we chose The Tea Room for our reception!

We are a wedding planning company, and the HarMac team doesn't know I'm writing this. We highly recommend them for their professionalism, organization, and value. It's a gorgeous venue with tons of spots for the most beautiful photos. It's conveniently located in Cedar Rapids, easy to find, and has lots of parking. We love the space's versatility for designing and organizing a variety of events, especially our weddings. It's literally such a great blank space. I had a meeting with Lia yesterday about an upcoming 2026 wedding, and she was so accommodating with everything our couple was requesting for their big day. If you're searching for something that is in Eastern Iowa that isn't a barn, check this out. It's a wonderful option.

This is a beautiful place to host your wedding. We were looking for something flexible and budget friendly. We rented the hall for 4 days to allow time to set up and take down and it was the best! We were able to supply our own vendor for food and drinks. It was everything we wanted! It has its own charm so you do not have to spend a fortune on decorations! In the beautiful scene of downtown Galena, our guests were so amazed with the beauty and charm our wedding offered! They had a great time and we got exactly what we wanted! A day that was all our own!

We loved working with Shane and the team at The Scottish Rite Consistory!! They were quick to answer all my questions and help me with anything we needed. Scottish Rite set up the table arrangement and chairs that I had mapped out for them and allowed us ample time to set up the week of the wedding. We were so happy with the remodel and the beautiful new chairs they had (we didn’t have to pay for chair covers)!!! I’d recommend this venue to everyone. It held our 250+ guests very comfortably.

Ushers Ferry was great to work with! They were so flexible as we had to change the location for the ceremony literally an hour before our wedding was to start due to rain. I would book with them again in a heartbeat!

Willing to work with clients, understanding to a point, as a COVID bride I can say these circumstances can bring out the worst in people. But not here.

Our corporate retreat, which included the escape room, was absolutely perfect! Service was amazing, and three months later my team is still talking about what a great day it was. So extremely affordable, welcoming, and thorough. Don't hesitate to book your event at Shores!
