We chose to have our ceremony and reception last minute at the Timberline Restaurant on top of Mt. Roberts and could not have been happier with the location and experience. The team was incredibly accommodating and all of our questions and needs were met a few weeks ahead of the wedding. We had a full out wedding including a photo booth, DJ, 7 piece band, dance floor, open bar, custom dinner menu and all. The team executed everything to perfection. We were blown away by the service, which included providing coordination services for our big day, set-up and break down, and changing over the space from cocktail hour to dinner service. This was the perfect team and venue to showcase the best of Alaska to our guests and we could not have picked a better spot to celebrate our love for each other. I highly recommend the Tram as a wedding venue; they were professional, responsive, detailed-oriented, and able to accommodate all our asks. We’ve had non-stop compliments from our friends and family about how awesome our wedding was and how much fun they had. I cannot thank Timberline Restaurant and the Tram enough for helping us have the perfect wedding!

We had a winter wedding, and I wanted it to be outdoors and magical. There were supposed to be 30 guests, but at the last minute more than 75 people RSVPed. Bear Creek Lodge was so accommodating, and they even had additional staff help us set up and clean up. I highly recommend this beautiful Alaskan backdrop to your wedding!

My husband and I had our wedding here in June of 2017 with about 40 guests. The setting is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! The weather was not cooperative (it snowed up on the pass!), so even though we had our ceremony on the beach, we ended up having our dinner and party mostly indoors, and it was really nice that this was an option. Kim was so friendly and helpful but also gave us our space and privacy, which was perfect. We had the best rehearsal dinner in the house, she cooked the food and was the BEST hostess. We HIGHLY recommend Viking Cove!!
