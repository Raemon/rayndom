Their performance felt effortless and polished, and they were wonderfully attentive to the flow of the ceremony ....amazing cocktail hour music. Many of our guests remarked on how memorable and magical the music made the day. It was a truly exquisite touch that added a sense of sophistication and heartfelt beauty to our celebration.

Hiring Will Faust to play guitar at our ceremony and cocktail hour for our wedding was one of the best decisions we made! I found Will after doing extensive research online and loved his entire song list. Will was so great and easy to work with leading up to the day, and went above and beyond by creating a custom arrangement for our processional and learning new songs that we requested to walk down the aisle to. We felt confident after having watched many of his YouTube videos and reading so many positive reviews, but were still blown away by his talent the day of. We received so many compliments from our guests, and would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a solo guitarist!!

Udeshi is so nice to work with. I’m so happy I hired her company for my daughter’s wedding. Her String Quartet performed during the arrival of guests and cocktail hour at the wedding and also at the Rehearsal Dinner. They were amazing and they really are the Best of the Best! Thank you Udeshi!! Michelle M

I can’t say enough great things about Deans’ Duet. Our entire family is very musical, and my daughter plays an instrument, piano, guitar, and has been a soloist and member of many choral and acappella groups. So we knew choosing the music would be an integral part of the wedding planning. I was worried about how we would get the right music outside on top of a mountain in the fall, but Deans’ Duet was the perfect choice for helping make my daughter’s dream wedding come true. Even though we went with the classic string quartet, having so many instrument group options was so nice when deciding. I never thought string versions of rock songs could sound so amazing but their expansive repertoire allowed us to incorporate all the music styles important to my daughter and our family. From the tv/movie theme prelude to the hard rock entrance and exit to the classical/hymn cocktail hour, these talented musicians helped make this day just as we all envisioned, as well as elegant and special for everyone there. They were prompt, courteous, and helpful in all communication and I really enjoyed working with them!

Monique was so easy to work with. Cafe String Quartet added a air of elegance and sophistication to my daughter's wedding. They played before and during the wedding ceremony and during the cocktail hour. They have a wide variety of music to choose from so they played classical pieces before and during the ceremony and more contemporary pieces during the cocktail hour. They are wonderfully talented musicians. Thank you Cafe String Quartet!

Elegant Ensembles did an excellent job performing for my wedding ceremony and cocktail hour. I was so impressed by the string trio's talent. They truly created an elegant, sentimental atmosphere. Mark was very easy to work with from day 1. His prices were among the best I found in the area. We got to choose all the songs that were played out of their extensive repertoire. They even offered to learn a Jewish song to play after the breaking of the glass ("Siman Tov, Mazel Tov"). Sometimes it was difficult to communicate: about a week before the wedding, my emails had not been answered for a couple weeks and I started to worry, but I was finally able to reach Mark by phone, so in the end it wasn't an issue. I was also concerned about timing since they weren't present for the rehearsal, but I shouldn't have worried at all because they were absolute pros and knew exactly when to play what based on the timeline I'd created in their online portal. Everything went off smoothly and beautifully! All in all, I'm very happy that I went with Elegant Ensembles!

Wow! They gave a beautiful performance at our wedding ceremony. I was surprised by how many guests mentioned it to me! They truly did a wonderful job. We are grateful that they were able to accommodate our song choices to give us a really special and magical wedding ceremony. They showed up early, dressed professionally, and were so kind as well. I booked with Sakira, and her communication beforehand made the booking process so easy. Would definitely hire again! Thank you!

Corda entertainment created the environment for both our ceremony and our cocktail hour. I absolutely loved walking down the aisle to the live song of my choosing, and guests kept telling me how much they loved listening to them play before the ceremony. Both parts outdoors and they had no problems with that. Would highly recommend them, additionally they are budget friendly and very easy to communicate with.

I am so thankful that Maura was a part of our special day, and I cannot recommend her to enough people. Having her play at our cocktail hour elevated the experience for our guests and so many people have reached out to say how great Maura was. She made everything leading up to our wedding and the day of so easy and effortless. I'm so glad she was recommended to us and having her play was a highlight of our wedding day.
