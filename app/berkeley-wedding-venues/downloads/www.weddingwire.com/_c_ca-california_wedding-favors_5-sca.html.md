Not only is Bwitched incredibly talented, but they brought such a calm, elegant energy to the day. Each portrait was spot-on, flattering, and done so beautifully. Our guests couldn’t believe how quickly they were drawn. It felt like watching art come to life in real time. The portraits doubled as the most memorable wedding favors. People were lining up because they loved the experience so much, and several guests told us it was their favorite part of the whole reception. It was easy to book and communicate during the wedding planning process which made my life so much easier.

Working with Mementro was one of the best decisions we made. The creative call was so much fun. We shared stories about how we met, our favorite spots, and little inside jokes, and they created merch that looked legittt. Our guests loved discovering those details, and the stand became one of the most photographed parts of the wedding. Can’t recommend enough !!

I came across Wild Nite and absolutely loved what I was seeing! Everything looks so elegant and beautiful. I definitely have my eye on a few things for my wedding day, but was also curious to see if there was anything else for my bachelorette trip and my honeymoon. To my pleasant surprise, the founder Taylor, exposed me to more of what Wild Nite has to offer. More pieces that are fun, flirty, and sexy! A little something for every part of my wedding journey. Taylor even mentioned that she could create custom pieces for me, my fiancé, or even my bridesmaids if that is something I’d be interested in. She was so sweet! I’m looking forward to connecting with Taylor and Wild Nite again as she made this part of my wedding process stress free. I can’t wait to pick out the right pieces for myself and my bridesmaids!

Working with Pink Matter was one of the easiest decisions in the wedding planning journey. The small details mattered a lot to us... and having a personalized element like this was exactly what we needed in the sea of rentals and decor. Every guest got to take something uniquely theirs and that made the whole celebration feel even more special.

I inquired working with idyllhands In December for an open house event I hosted at my place of work. The lovely sisters did permanent jewelry with their adorable set up for a few hours. They are a joy to be around and my coworkers and l still talk about how much we love our gold bracelets. I would highly recommend them for your next event.

We had the absolute pleasure of having Yurik as our live painter for our wedding, and we couldn’t be happier with the experience! From the very beginning, he was responsive, communicative, and so easy to work with throughout the entire planning process. On the wedding day, he captured our moment beautifully—every detail, color, and emotion came through perfectly in the final painting. It’s such a special keepsake that we’ll treasure forever. Yurik truly went above and beyond. 10/10 highly recommend!
