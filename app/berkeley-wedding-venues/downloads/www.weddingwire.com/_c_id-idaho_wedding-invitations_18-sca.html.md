I can’t say enough how happy I have been with this company, the pricing, and the quality achieved by Save The Date Originals. My save the dates turned out amazing! Thank you so much for working with me and my fiancé to achieve exactly what we were looking for!

Working with Chris for my invitations and all my stationary needs was a delight! She has such an eye for design and was able to incorporate my basic ideas into creating the most amazing formal invitations ever! Many of our guests felt as though they were receiving an invitation to a royal wedding, which gives you an idea of how intricate, detailed, and gorgeous they turned out. From Save the Dates to the invites and RSVP cards to Thank You notes and wedding programs, each and every item was stunning! She even made mini-passports showcasing the itinerary of the evening for our "travel-themed" reception. Chris's flexibility with handling clients during the early onset of COVID was reassuring and easy. She was quick to respond to any questions or changes as they arose. I would highly recommend Chris for any occasion or stationery needs!!

We had a custom wedding invitation created for our wedding, as I could find nothing online that was simple enough but still beautiful. We had a consultation Nichole, and then she created beautiful wedding invitations for us. I could not have asked for more beautiful invitations, or better service!

Her work is amazing and the 'save the dates' & invites' turned out just the way I wanted them. Jenica is a great artist! She is pretty much able to do anything that you want and I love her style! I gave her plenty of wiggle room to add her own touches and it turned about beautifully.
