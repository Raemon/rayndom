I am not an easy person to please as I expect excellence and perfection - which is tough with a wedding. But every vendor Cláudia recommended went above and beyond to make our day so magical. Claudia was so organized with the schedule and was our point person day of and it took a lot of stress off me and my family. She also clearly takes pride in her work and gives her all. I would one thousand percent recommend her. And I would listen to any and all advice! Anything connecting to Claudia and her role was flawless.

I’ve never wanted to write a review more than this one. Oui Love You Weddings is truly the most amazing wedding planning company and gave us the best day of our lives. I had a destination wedding in Portugal and needed a local planner who could help me coordinate everything from the U.S. After hours of research on Google and Reddit, I found Oui Love You. I compared several planners at different price points—low, medium, and high—and Oui Love You stood out immediately. They responded quickly, communicated clearly, and made the entire process easy despite the six-hour time difference and language barrier. Destination weddings don’t come with a step-by-step guide—you never really know if you’re getting scammed or what things should cost—but Oui Love You made me feel completely at ease. I was assigned Carlota as my planner, and she is now not only someone I consider a friend but an expert who deserves serious recognition for her incredible work. As a project manager (and a self-proclaimed Type A micro-manager!), I know how hard it is to impress me—but planning with Carlota was effortless. I gave her my budget, she built a detailed spreadsheet, had me create a mood board, and only presented vendors and options that aligned perfectly with what I wanted. She was honest, transparent, and even advised me where not to spend money—something rare and invaluable. Since I couldn’t travel to Portugal for tastings, venue visits, or vendor meetings, I had to put complete trust in Carlota—and she delivered beyond expectations. She communicated even outside of business hours and kept me informed during every lull in planning. When we finally arrived in Portugal, I was blown away by the quality, organization, and attention to detail she put into everything. On the wedding day, Carlota was everywhere at once—keeping vendors on time, managing every detail, and somehow always appearing when I needed her (like when I needed help with my shoes!). Beyond logistics, she also mastered something few planners truly do: the flow of the day. Every moment transitioned seamlessly into the next, building excitement from start to finish. Our guests kept saying it was the best wedding they’d ever been to. If you’re a bride looking for a sign to hire Oui Love You Weddings, this is it—and request Carlota!

Where do I even begin… Fashion Moments Joana and her entire team were an incredible privilege to work with. From the very first time we spoke with and met Joana we knew we made the right decision choosing her company. Every single part of the wedding day, rehearsal and the planning leading up to it was an amazing experience handled with professionalism, laughs and awe! What Joana was able to bring to life for us was breathtaking, emotional, memorable and unique. She will forever be apart of our some of our fondest memories of the wedding planning process! Our guests 2 months later are still talking about the beauty of the tables, the ceremony, the decor, the flowers and everything that was brought to life, she listened to our dreams and made them a reality. The vendors that were recommended were all professional and experienced we were not disappointed! If you are thinking of working with Fashion Moments, don’t hesitate they are kind, professional, easy and amazing artists! Thank you thank you thank you we will never forget what you brought to life for our family and our daughter!

We had the most amazing experience working with Monica and Patricia to plan our elopement in the beautiful Douro Valley. We are so incredibly grateful for their wealth of experience, professionalism and attention to detail. And for helping us bring together the absolute dream team of vendors who together made our wedding day truly special. Thankyou for helping us bring our elopement dreams and visions to life & for being the sweetest, kindest and most wonderful humans X Tania & Luke
