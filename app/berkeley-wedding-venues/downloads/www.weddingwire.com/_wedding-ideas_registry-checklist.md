## How Many Items Should I Put on My Registry? 

Wondering how many gifts to add to your registry? There's an easy answer, and it all comes down to simple math. Multiply your guest list by two, and add a few extras. This will give loved ones plenty of options to choose from (at a variety of price ranges too). Since every guest is working with a different budget, they'll appreciate having an abundance of choices. Creating a fuller wishlist can also prevent guests from shopping off-registry. Keep in mind that not every gift will be purchased—but guests will appreciate having lots of wedding registry ideas to browse. 

## What Should I Put on My Registry? 

The contents of a wedding registry will vary for every couple. As you begin wedding planning, the most important task is to create a registry with gifts you need most. If you and your S.O. have been living together for years, don't feel pressured to register for traditional gifts like serving sets and cookware if you already have them. Instead, ask for items you're excited about, like a sleek espresso machine or handmade artisan throw pillows that'll match your home aesthetic. To help you narrow down your wishlist, we've rounded up the best wedding registry ideas for every room in your house. Use this wedding registry checklist to ensure you've got the basics (and the extras) covered.

## What Should You Not Put on Your Wedding Registry?

While there aren't too many rules about what you can add to your wishlist, there are a few [things you shouldn't register for](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/things-not-to-register-for). Because there are so many wedding registry ideas, it's easy to get carried away when selecting gifts. Keep in mind that your wedding registry is a shared list for you and your partner, so it's not the place for personal items (think: clothing, jewelry, or individual tech gadgets). Also avoid registering for gifts for other people, trendy items you might want to return in the future, and things you specifically want to use for your wedding day. By keeping your wedding registry list specific to items for your newlywed life, guests will have no problem selecting the perfect present. 

## How Many Registries Should You Have?

We'll let you in on a [wedding registry secret](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-registry-tips-secrets): You can (and should) have more than one wishlist. Diversifying your wedding registry lists will give guests even more options and make the gifting experience as easy as possible. Consider making two to three registries at different stores—or, combine a variety of stores with [a universal registry](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/honeymoon-registry). You can even add a specialty registry, like a honeymoon fund or a charity registry, into the mix. Having multiple registries [on your wedding website](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-things-your-wedding-website-needs-right-now) will diversify the gifts you receive, allowing you to make the most out of your requests. Use our wedding registry checklist above to organize your wants and needs, and determine the best stores to fit your lifestyle. 

## How Expensive Should Wedding Registry Items Be?

One of the most important considerations to keep in mind when creating your registry is the cost of each item. With so many wedding registry ideas to pick from, it can be easy to add the most luxurious (and expensive) gifts to your wishlist. It is important to include a few high-ticket items, because some guests will want to splurge on your wedding present. But also be sure to cater your wedding registry list to all guests, including those who might be working with a smaller budget. We recommend adding a range of wedding gifts between $50 and $200+. Having plenty of gift options at various price points will create an easy gifting experience for your nearest and dearest. After all, that's the most important reason for creating a wedding registry list—and it's a great way to ensure you and your partner will get the gifts you want most on your big day.
