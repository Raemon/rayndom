### Something to Grow Together

Plants bring beautiful balance to any interior design concept, and a new plant is a perfect way to symbolize a new life together! Fill this stylish, handmade pot with a young houseplant (like a trendy fiddle leaf fig) and leave it to your couple of honor to help it grow, along with their love for each other.

**EliteEssentialsArt** handmade ceramic planter, $70, [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1286146296/handmade-ceramic-planter-ceramic-planter)

### A Reason to Hang Out More

If you think they already have everything they need for inside their home, consider the outside! This eye-catching and eco-conscious woven hammock will brighten up everything from their suburban backyard to their big-city balcony, and will encourage them to slow down and just hang together. Such a creative wedding gift idea.

###  A Branded Bottle for their Brews

Craft beer couples might have their own homebrew setup under the kitchen sink, but do they have a heavy-duty glass growler personalized with their very own “brand?” Didn’t think so! Grab a couple of these to encourage even more bonding over their favorite local beers.

**BlueRidgeMountainCo** personalized beer growler, from $24, [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/639849760/personalized-beer-growler-engraved)

### A Stylish Upgrade They Probably Haven’t Thought Of

This simply designed, kinda-mod, kinda-farmhouse number plaque is an easy way to add a hit of style to a part of the house that’s often overlooked.

**CJamStore** house number plaque, from $85, [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/712124546/house-number-plaque-address-sign-house)

### A Cozy Cuddling Device

A beautifully made blanket perfect for cuddling up underneath together for a long, rainy day of binge-watching? That’s ultimate wedding gift for the couple who has everything if you ask us! The whimsical rainbow and modern colors make it gender neutral and fit for just about any room.

### A Monthly Dose of Inspiration

A magazine subscription is a great gift because it keeps right on gifting and will remind your favorite couple of their wedding day every time they get a new issue. Pick a mag you think they’ll both enjoy—like Condé Nast Traveler, which is packed with dreamy stories and adventure inspo.

**Condé Nast Traveler** magazine subscription, from $20, [DiscountMags.com](https://www.discountmags.com/magazine/conde-nast-traveler)

### A Heartwarming Paw-trait

The only thing a married couple loves more than one another is [their pet](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/couples-getting-a-dog-together). Take it from someone who knows! This bespoke art piece, custom made from an image of your friends’ pet, will be loved for generations. It might just end up side-by-side with the wedding portraits!

**OnTheEdgeCreations** custom cameo pet portrait, from $60, [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/759514733/custom-cameo-pet-portrait-gift-for-pet)

### A Cheeky Bath Mat

**Urban Outfitters** sweet cheeks bath mat, $39, [Urban Outfitters](https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/sweet-cheeks-bath-mat)

### An Alcohol Infusion Kit

They’ll definitely get those Moscow mule cups and that rose gold cocktail shaker on their registry. But it’s up to you to help them find a whole new way to mix drinks! This fun, interactive kit is a great way for your favorite couple to spend time together and create one-of-a-kind cocktails at home.

**Uncommon Goods** infuse and pour alcohol kit, $25, [Uncommon Goods](https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/infuse-pour-alcohol-kit)

**SideHustleSerenity** lavender vanilla mini spa gift set, $26, [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/669648642/lavender-vanilla-mini-spa-gift-set)

### An Outdoorsy Couple’s Best Friend

This genius backpack is a triple threat: gear carrier, lightweight fold-out seat, and cooler! It’s the perfect partner for the outdoorsy couple (second only to one another, obvs). Get it emblazoned with their new family initials to make it even more special. 

**WeddingWire Shop** personalized cooler chair backpack, $56, [WeddingWire Shop](https://www.weddingwireshop.com/product/personalized-black-folding-cooler-chair-backpack-monogram-embroidered?utm_source=weddingwire&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=wedding-gifts-for-the-couple-who-has-everything&utm_campaign=wweditorial)

### A Board to Make their Bathroom More Luxe

They registered for towels, soap dispensers, even a digital scale. But they have no idea how much they need this beautiful bathtub caddy made from solid pine. It props books, toiletries, candles and wine glasses for a spa-like bath every time.

**OspreyWolfWildWoods** bath caddy, from $107, [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1318603768/bath-caddy-live-edge-bathtub-tray-bath)

###  Something That’s Just for Fun

For the games-loving couple who also happens to have good interior design sense, this personalizable piece is just as fun to look at on display as it is to play! Perfect for hyper-connected couples who might want something analog to do together once in a while.

**Uncommon Goods** personalized hearts four-across game, $90, [Uncommon Goods](https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/personalized-hearts-four-across-game)

### A Sleek and Stylish Apron

Whether they’re novices in the kitchen or super-foodies, they’ll appreciate a pair of these Japanese-inspired aprons in breezy linen. And whoever is responsible for laundry in the household will double-appreciate them… especially on red sauce nights.

**MagicLinen** Japanese cross back linen apron, $75, [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/554386225/japanese-cross-back-linen-apron-japanese)

### A Vintage-Inspired Record Player

Listening to records together > watching Netflix together. Encourage cozy nights in with cocktails and conversation over favorite albums with a petite, portable and beautifully made record player that will add a bit of rock-and-roll cool to any room.

**Crosley** Cruiser deluxe turntable, $100, [Pottery Barn](https://www.potterybarn.com/products/crosley-cruiser-deluxe-turntable-mp/)

### The Ultimate Wifi Router

It may not be the most romantic or sentimental wedding gift for the couple who has everything, but it’s definitely the most practical and has the makings to be their absolute favorite thing. This (adorable) wifi extender from Google blankets their entire house in fast wifi, so they’ll never have to argue over who gets to stream what again.

**Google** Nest wifi router, $169, [Google](https://store.google.com/us/config/nest_wifi?sku=_google_nest_wifi_point_snow)

### A Pre-Written Bucket List

All the work has been done by the author of this book. All that’s left to do for your favorite couple is hit the tarmac for some adventuring! For travel-loving couples, outdoorsy couples or simply couples who love trying new things, this heartfelt gift will be as fun to page through together as it will be to use as actual inspo for experiences to share together.
