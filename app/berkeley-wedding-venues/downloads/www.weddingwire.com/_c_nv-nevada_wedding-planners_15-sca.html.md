I have been to a couple of parties that were planned and organized by Toastworthy Events and they were gorgeous. They will cover every detail of your event. Centerpieces, balloons. personalized cookies, and even dressed characters for children’s birthday,. Toastworthy Events will bring your party vision to fruition.

Lynne and her team were so amazing and sweet! Lynne was so helpful leading up to my wedding day, from organizing my wedding timeline to contacting my vendors and making sure everything was lined up perfectly for wedding day. She helped my wedding run so smoothly that I didn’t have to worry about anything and just have fun! The team did a great job setting up my ceremony and reception venue just how I wanted, and keeping us all on time! I can never thank her and her team for giving us such a special day we will remember forever!

Working with Julia was great with helping us bring our outdoor Tahoe wedding vision to life. We live in Oregon so she was very helpful with her expertise of the area and referring us to a lot of great local, trusting vendors. She helped kept us organized and I really appreciated her calm demeanor on the wedding day to help us all stay on schedule especially when it stormed right before the wedding! Julia is also a very lovely person to get to know along this journey and glad we were able to work together!

Jessi, Monique and their team did a truly *epic* job of capturing our vision for our wedding day in June 2025 and executing flawlessly. From day one, they came in with energy, joy, enthusiasm and full support of making our dreams come true. And boy did we have some unconventional dreams, like my husband arriving to the ceremony by scuba diving up to the ceremony cite!! The venue gave us some grief, about that and many other things we wanted to achieve, but Epic Thyme navigated it perfectly and helped us execute everything we wanted. Their eye for style and design far surpasses our own, and the day of, they created absolutely magical, show-stopping visual impact. The whole day flowed perfectly, on time, zero mishaps, and we enjoyed the day without a care in a the world. Every one of our guests told us ours was the best wedding they had ever been to, and this was all due to Epic Thyme, their expertise, full heartedness and commitment to their clients. Thank you Jessi, Monique and making our dreams come true, for us and all our guests. We will never forget it

My husband and I got married on November 1, 2025 in Truckee, CA and had been planning for about a year. I found Stephanie in late 2024 on Instagram and from the very beginning of our planning process, she was an absolute gift. While she was our day-of coordinator, she felt so much more like a planning partner and steady guide throughout the entire journey. In the months leading up to the wedding, Stephanie was incredibly organized, thoughtful, and generous with her time, answering questions, offering guidance, helping us think through logistics we never would have considered, and making the planning process feel manageable and calm. As a bride, having someone who was both knowledgeable and reassuring made such a huge difference. I’m very type A and like things to be done a certain way, and Stephanie not only understood that immediately, but met me exactly where I was, respecting my vision, honoring the details, and executing everything flawlessly without ever making me feel stressed or unheard. On the wedding day itself, Stephanie was nothing short of amazing. She handled every detail seamlessly, kept everything running smoothly, and solved problems before we even knew they existed. Because of her, I was able to be fully present and enjoy every moment without stress. She was completely on top of everything from start to finish. If you’re looking for someone who will support you before, during, and throughout your entire wedding experience, someone who truly cares and shows up in every way, Stephanie is it. My husband and I are so grateful for her and her team and cannot recommend them enough.

Andrea at Symphony Weddings & Events was amazing. Our wedding was a smaller Vegas destination wedding, and everything ran flawlessly. She and her team were incredibly organized, prepared for literally anything, and handled every detail without me having to think twice. I was able to fully enjoy the night and just be present, which is exactly what I wanted. Highly recommend working with Andrea if you want a stress-free wedding.

Hiring Rachelle was the best decision we made. We thought we could plan our wedding alone, and 6 months in we realized we need help. We hired Rachelle and since day one she took over and took charge of everything. She helped us finalize the vendors, the timeline, she helped us hire a trio to play during Cocktail hour. But most importantly she was there in charge on our wedding da, which allowed us to have a blast. Thank you Rachelle!

My husband and I had the pleasure of working with Liane on our wedding day this past summer, and recommend her very highly to any couple looking for any planning or day of assistance! Our start with Liane was a little untraditional in that we had a change of plans from another coordinator/planner who could no longer make our event, and she sent us to Liane - about a month prior to the wedding. While we were momentarily stressed about this change, we quickly realized we had no reason to worry. Liane jumped in and did not miss and single beat, she immediately was well familiarized with our vision, plans, preferences, challenges, etc. She worked quickly, efficiently and accurately to get up to speed with us and go above and beyond to make our wedding day impossibly smooth! The day of our wedding, I cannot say a single thing went wrong and I firmly believe a lot if not all of that is thanks to Liane and her team. As the bride I didn’t notice or see anything off plan or out of place, our guests were very well taken care of, as were the groom and I. I told her my 2 non negotiables were getting married and getting a slice of cake, and she made sure both happened without any issues! She even calmly but firmly ushered the groom away from the bar and back to me, and got his drink out for him. If you want somebody who will be there right along side your vision and wedding dreams - who can clearly thrive even with minimal direction and time - Liane is the one for you. Your wedding day, you and your partner, friends, family, and vendors will all be cared for and on the same page. Obviously I hope this is my one and only marriage, but if I ever did it again I’d choose Liane again - and recommend her up and down to anybody and everybody looking for these services.

We had the absolute pleasure of working with Lindsey throughout our entire wedding planning journey, and she truly helped us create our dream wedding. From the very beginning, she took the time to thoughtfully listen to us and understand our vision, ensuring every detail reflected who we are. Lindsey is not only incredibly organized and professional, but she also handled countless details seamlessly behind the scenes so we could simply enjoy the day. Thanks to her expertise and relationships, we were connected with an amazing team of local vendors including our florist, cake designer, musicians, photographer, and videographer. Our wedding day was everything we hoped for and more, and we owe so much of that to Lindsey’s dedication, creativity, and care. We cannot recommend her highly enough.
