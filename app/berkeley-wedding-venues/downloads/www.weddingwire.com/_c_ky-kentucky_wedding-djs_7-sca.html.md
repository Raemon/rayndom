We had Andy as our DJ for our wedding and couldn’t be happier with how it went. She really understood our vibe and made the party memorable. Could recommend her enough!

Randy did an amazing job and was super easy to communicate with. Reviews from the guests have been great as far as I am away. Definitely would recommend to any future bride :)

Junie did an awesome job at our wedding reception! He was very easy to talk with and the list that he provided was great in making sure we did not leave out any important music. No explicit lyrics were played which was great since we had young children there. We would recommend him to anyone!

We booked Encore Event Group for our wedding reception, and they were BRILLIANT! From the decor, to the DJ experience, to the energy in the room -- everything was perfect! Their quote was very reasonable given the design we had in mind, and the set-up/tear-down experience was a breeze. Book this group with confidence!!!

We used PartyZone for lighting, staging, pipe and drape and ceremony/ cocktail hour music for our August 2025 wedding. They delivered 100% and we are so happy with our wedding looked. They were communicative, prompt and budget friendly. They had no trouble with our playlists for ceremony and cocktail hour, and the lighting was beautiful. So glad we went with PartyZone!

Kenny played at our wedding reception! Kenny was an absolute gem and easy to coordinate and work with. A week out from our wedding we still hadn't nailed down the songs. Kenny handled our last minute requests with ease and gave awesome recommendations. Our guests could not stop raving about how beautifully the playlist flowed! Kenny made our dinner reception full of old classics and modern soft songs. For our dancing he handled guest request as well as following are vibe that we wanted. We ended up leaving a little bit earlier from the reception then planned, he handled everything will grace and ease. I 1000% percent would recommend him for any wedding. He was the absolute best! Thanks again Kenny, you made our wedding wonderful!

Patrick Salyer was our DJ and he was fantastic! He was very easy to work with. He took all of our requests and added in some great complementary songs during the night. We were really happy to have Patrick as our DJ!

DJ Fuse and the KY Pro DJ team were perfect for our Cincinnati wedding earlier this fall! Communication was very professional before the event, with Fuse taking the time to fully understand out playlist preferences and the atmosphere that we wanted the music to create. We had a unique set-up for a backyard wedding with multiple vendors, and the KY Pro DJ team integrated seamlessly with zero drama. The set itself was amazing! For weeks afterwards, we had guests tell us 'the music was great' and they 'had so much fun dancing' and 'it was the best wedding DJ they'd ever seen'. Fuse kept the energy high past 1:30am, interacted with our guests, and came with more than a few surprises... We could not have asked for anything more and wholeheartedly recommend Fuse and the KY Pro DJ crew! Great people and great music.
