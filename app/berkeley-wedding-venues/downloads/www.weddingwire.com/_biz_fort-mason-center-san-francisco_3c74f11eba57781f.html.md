A Dream Wedding

If I had do it all over again, I would do it exactly the same! It was a dream come true to have our wedding reception at Fort Mason and I'm so thankful to have had Shawn and the whole team at Fort Mason to assist with our wedding day. The venue is beautiful and all of our guests were stunned by the view and location.

Lovely Firehouse wedding

Shawn was my main contact for planning my wedding. He was responsive and flexible and helped me create a floor plan that worked really well for our event.  
The Firehouse was so lovely and the views are amazing! The space was perfect for our wedding with 75 guests.

The historic Fort Mason Center on the SF Marina made a beautiful backdrop for our wedding ceremony. There was also ample parking which is rare in SF. We rented the Conference Center and the Marina Room in the back where the me, the bride, and the bridesmaids could get dressed. The facility coordinator, Laurie Brown, was very professional and informative. The chairs were set up just like we asked and there was a cleaning crew to handle any mess.

We got married in October at the General's Residence. The view is stunning and the old-school feel of the entire building is priceless. The first time I saw the Residence I was worried it would be a little bleak. But once the flowers were arranged, the caterer had set up, and our DJ did some uplighting, the Residence was breathtaking. It was the perfect way to show our out-of-town guests some classy San Francisco style.

I immediately fell in love with the old time and traditional feel of this venue. The venue is breathtaking and beautiful. I enjoyed it as the venue for both my wedding and reception. In an effort to be truly helpful to couples considering it as well, here's a pro/con assessment.  
  
Pros: The view! Again, magnificent. The building itself. Old style and classy. A lot of space overall, with the various rooms to dance, sit, dress, eat, etc. as well as take pictures. Has a kitchen for whatever caterer you choose. Linens available to rent; typically cheaper than other rental places and they set them up for you. Chairs/tables included in fees (inside only). Chapel (across the driveway) also available for rent (separate fee) if your heart was set on a church setting close to the reception venue. I would have loved to do that but the total fees would have exceeded our budget.  
  
Cons: Parking. Some available for free and close, but the majority is in lower Fort Mason and is a bit of a hike to the venue. Guest should allow plenty of time to walk from there. Kitchen is not a working kitchen; you will need to rent a fryer or oven or whatever your caterer needs to prepare hot food if required by your menu. Trash-you're responsible for disposing of it and there's no bin on site. Our caterer took it back for us and disposed of it in their bins. Finally, on the day of the wedding, as my vendors and I were arriving, another couple had a ceremony in the chapel and decided afterwards to block the street and only entrance into the General's Residence by having a motorcycle show for 15-20 minutes. I called the main office and was told there was nothing they could do. Fortunately, and ultimately, it made little difference for my preparations. It did create some frustration and unnecessary anxiety for me.  
  
All in all, I would still recommend the venue. I loved it. My guests loved it. And our pictures are breathtaking.

Amazing venue! Great views, lots of space, rooms available for both bridal parties to get ready. Flameless kitchen (big) but requires catering to rent ovens/stovetops which adds up in rental costs. Over our budget but we wanted to splurge on a great SF venue. Our guests were really wowed at how cool and unique this venue is!

3.1 

The location is absolutely beautiful. However, like with several other venues that work with wedding parties, they were at times extremely unresponsive and inflexible. There are a lot of hidden costs. The first person we were working with only helped until we made a deposit. Then we were passed to another person. We tried for three months to get ahold of either of these individuals only to learn that they both quit or were released. So we got another person, who of course shared information different from the first. The person who was on hand the day of, which was also a different person was absolutely lovely. Though, I think I had a reaction to her eating the hors d'oeuvres. Did I say the space was truly beautiful. They have a lot of rooms upstairs, but discourage you from using them. Lastly, they refused to bend any and let us buy an extra hour, which the original person said would be possible. They said it would not be legal for us to be on the property while they were cleaning up. This meant we had a half hour to get everything ready and start the ceremony. But they asked our caterer if it would be okay with her if they left a dump truck from the previous group onsite during our ceremony. I was very disappointed as they weren't in contract with the caterer, but instead with us. Overall, my experience was great, despite all of that. I really think they deserve a 3.5 - 4, but just not because of the areas above.
