I would recommend Danielle again and again! After just one call with her, she brought my vision to life! She really listens and pays attention to every little detail that sets paper goods apart. She was also very helpful and creative in finding ways to make unique paper goods for our wedding that also fit our budget. Going with Franklin paper studio was one of the best decisions we made in wedding planning - I consider our paper goods art that I’ll always treasure!

I've had the pleasure of working with the Arlene Segal Designs team for several years on invitations for an annual Make-A-Wish Gala event. Each year the event's theme changes, and each year the ASD rises to the occasion in a big way, coming up with inventive and elegant invitations. From cowboy boots to tuxedoes to rainbow zebra patterns – their creativity and flair for design provide truly over the top, lavish results that our attendees rave about.

Marcelle does amazing work at a very affordable price. She was also extremely flexible with us as we had not yet completed our seating chart when we first sent her our list of names for the Place Cards. She was very easy to get along with, very organized, very efficient, and very professional. We had several guests compliment the places cards, and even more took them home as a keep sake.

I cannot recommend Creative Weddings in Coral Gables enough! From start to finish, the experience was seamless and personalized. Erasmo truly listened to our vision and brought it to life with the most stunning invitations we could have ever imagined. The quality of the paper, the elegant design, and the attention to detail were beyond anything we expected. Professional, creative, and genuinely caring — Creative Weddings made the process stress-free and enjoyable. If you’re looking for beautiful, high-quality invitations with exceptional service, this is the place to go!

Working with Diane at Tampa Calligraphy was an absolute pleasure! From our invitations to every detail in between, she is truly a master of her craft. Her expertise, combined with her open and responsive communication, made the entire process enjoyable and stress-free. She’d be the only person I’d ever call for something like this again (thankfully not for another wedding!). Her work is nothing short of breathtakingly beautiful. If you’re considering Diane and Tampa Calligraphy, book her now, I promise you won’t regret it. Anna and I can’t thank Diane enough for everything she did to make our stationery perfect!

Denise is a class act, and absolutely on top of it. Her work is stunning and she comes up with ideas that help fit within your budget. We worked with her on our invitations and all paper goods for wedding day. She completed proofs to make sure it was exactly what we wanted. Everything was absolutely perfect and we can't thank her enough for her patience and hard work!!

Cami did the seating chart, and welcome sign for our 05/04 wedding. Both mirrors looked absolute gorgeous and were exactly what we were looking for. Her writing is beautiful and she was very reasonably priced!
