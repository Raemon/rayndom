Hotel DuPont and Alisha!! 

Alisha truly was the best to work with! She coordinated everything perfectly and was so amazing to work with. She always responded right away and answered all questions and eased all of our nerves! She truly was so amazing to work with and made sure everything was taken care of- from the details that we would have never thought of to the big stuff - she truly made everything perfect. Alisha truly made our day perfect and beyond what we dreamed of!

Unforgettable Experience

Getting married at Hotel Du Pont was a magical and incredible experience. Shellie, the hotel's Director of Catering made this entire experience feel easier, calmer, and more joyful than we ever could have imagined. Her patience, kindness, and guidance were so helpful throughout the entire process. Shellie listened to every detail, big and small, offered thoughtful suggestions, and helped us navigate decisions we didn’t even realize we needed to think about. Her experience and calm confidence made the planning process feel effortless — especially during moments that could have easily become overwhelming. We truly had our dream wedding and she played a big role in that! There is not one thing I would change. I want to relive it over and over again! We are so grateful for the care and intention Shellie and the hotel staff brought to every detail. Everything flowed so seamlessly, and we know that was because of all the hard work happening quietly behind the scenes. Our experience overall at Hotel Du Pont was phenomenal and everyone truly went above and beyond. From Bruce our driver, to Frank one of our bartenders, Gary one of our servers, to Chris serving us in the morning (and so many more!). Everyone was kind and sweet and the service was incredible. Thank you for helping us create memories that will last a lifetime.

Best Wedding Venue 

Our wedding at the Hotel Du Pont was an absolute dream. From the moment we arrived, we were blown away by the elegance, attention to detail, and incredible level of service. Every member of the staff went above and beyond to make our day feel special, and we truly felt taken care of from start to finish.  
  
The venue itself is breathtaking—timeless, romantic, and rich with character. From the stunning ballroom to the intimate spaces for photos, every corner of the hotel became the perfect backdrop for our day. The food was exceptional, the service was flawless, and everything ran seamlessly.  
  
Our guests are still raving about how beautiful the venue was and how smooth the entire experience felt. We couldn’t have imagined a more perfect place to celebrate such an important moment in our lives.  
  
If you’re considering the Hotel Du Pont for your wedding, don’t hesitate—it’s everything you hope for and more. We are beyond grateful for the unforgettable experience and memories that will last a lifetime.  
  
Special shout out to Shellie the wedding coordinator she is fabulous!

The best weekend of our lives! 

We got married at Hotel Du Pont last weekend, and it was absolutely incredible from start to finish. The venue is stunning, the food was exceptional (our guests are still talking about it!), and the rooms are truly incredible. Every detail felt thoughtful and elegant, and the entire team made the day run seamlessly. It was the best weekend of our lives. We couldn’t have imagined a more perfect place to celebrate our wedding. Thank you to the entire Hotel Du Pont team for making it all so unforgettable!

The perfect venue!

We are SO glad we chose Hotel du Pont as our wedding venue.  
  
We had our ceremony off-site in the chapel at Villanova University and it was so nice that once our guests arrived at the hotel, they were able to stay put and be taken care of for the rest of the weekend, but there were enough spaces to be somewhere different for all of our events. The bars at Le Cav and The Green Room were perfect gathering spaces for our guests throughout the weekend, and everything from the cocktail hour and reception in the Gold Ballroom, to the after party in the Christina Room, to the brunch in the Du Barry room was perfect!  
  
We worked with 2 other coordinators briefly in the year and a half leading up to our wedding before Shellie took over, and we are so glad she did. She was able to accommodate all of the small requests that made our day run smoothly and feel like us, and overall was just a pleasure to work with - very responsive with all of our questions along the way! She was especially helpful with accommodating us with additional space to get ready when the Currie salon closed effective immediately one week before our wedding.  
  
All of our guests are raving about the grandness of the venue, the food, and how much fun they had.  
  
We can't wait to come back for weekend trips for years to come, and hope we get to be guests at a wedding here - one night wasn't enough!

Elegance and Fun!

The historic Hotel DuPont's stunning architecture and elegant interiors created the perfect location for the wedding of our dreams. Our ceremony took place in the charming DuBarry Room, which held our 220 guests comfortably and was just a winding staircase away from the iconic Gold Ballroom, where our reception unfolded. Our 12-person band performed on a stage at the rear of the ballroom where we had plenty of space for dancing, which made for a fun night of entertainment and mingling with guests.  
  
The high level of professionalism and service provided by the staff at Hotel DuPont stood out not only to my husband and me but also to our guests. With every single interaction, the staff was attentive and made people feel special. We felt like we had stepped back in time! Our guests also raved about all the dinner courses, the variety and presentation of food and drinks at the cocktail hour, and brunch the next morning.  
  
From day one, we knew we were in good hands with Shellie. She was so knowledgeable, responsive, flexible, understanding, and always pleasant! She was available every step of the way, even for last-minute changes. She and her staff used their extensive experience to make our wedding day perfect. Most of our vendors had worked at the hotel in the past, and with each other and Shellie, making planning the wedding easy and the day of logistics seamless. It felt like a well-oiled machine!  
  
My husband and I have so many wonderful memories of our wedding and cannot recommend Hotel DuPont enough. We look forward to celebrating our first anniversary at the hotel and enjoying the delicious wedding cake we had at our reception.

Best Wedding Venue!

Hotel DuPont and Jenni were all amazing with assisting us with all of our wedding dreams. From getting ideas, confirmation of details, and wonderful tasting in the months leading up, to the day of everything was perfect. I was able to relay on their communication, attention to detail, and professionalism. The Hotel DuPont is absolutely stunning and they have an incredible staff that supports all wedding needs.

The Best Wedding Ever

The Hotel DuPont was amazing! So many of our guests said this was the best wedding they had ever been to, whether it be the food, service, or just the beauty of the venue. The entire staff was so attentive to my now husband and I throughout the entire planning process, and the day turned out perfectly. I could not have asked for a better wedding.

Timeless and Elegant

Absolutely amazing experience. From our first tour with Courtney it was obvious how special this venue was, our guests were SO impressed. It made decor EASY. The team really catered to our needs, even going as far as working with the bar manager at Le Cav to customize our signature drinks. The food was incredible (how often do you get to say that at a wedding?) and various staff throughout the event were professional and kind. We even had a few guests extend their weekend at the hotel after the wedding and they were granted the hotel block price. Cannot say enough great things about this venue. It's a no-brainer.
