When my fiancé and I first started envisioning our wedding day, we knew one thing for sure: pizza had to be the main course. It’s our favorite meal to make together, so having it at our wedding felt personal and meaningful. After searching online, we found Pizzasmith, and we truly could not be happier with how our wedding dinner turned out. We wanted to serve an entirely vegan menu, and the Pizzasmith team was so excited and eager to help us make that happen. They worked with us to create four incredible varieties of vegan pizza, and everything was absolutely delicious. Our guests raved about the food and many were excited to enjoy the extra leftovers with us the following day. The entire team was wonderful to work with: friendly, responsive, and totally on top of the schedule we had agreed on. Dinner service went smoothly and stress-free, and the fun, casual vibe of the pizza truck added so much joy to the atmosphere. We’re so grateful we found Pizzasmith. They helped make our wedding meal not only delicious, but truly memorable. Highly recommend!

Joy and the entire Festive Boards team added so much heart and care to our wedding day. From the very beginning, they treated us with genuine kindness and made us feel so supported throughout the whole planning process. On the day of the wedding, their coordination, warmth, and attention to detail were extraordinary. The food was incredible—not only delicious but clearly made with pride and creativity. Our guests are still talking about it. But beyond the food, it was the service that made the biggest impact. Joy’s team went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly, and they did it all with such a joyful and uplifting spirit. We couldn’t be more grateful. Festive Boards helped make our wedding feel effortless, beautiful, and filled with love. We wholeheartedly recommend Joy and her team to anyone wanting a catering experience that is both exceptional and deeply caring.

The first thing you're supposed to do when planning a wedding is to book your venue ASAP and Constantino's was the last stop on our venue tours and I booked it, thinking it would be WAY out of our price range and not fit the "vision" my husband and I had. We left the appointment knowing that this was going to be where we were getting married in a year. Our consultant was very friendly and patient and the location is beautiful and picture perfect. When I went home and ran the numbers, for an "all-inclusive" venue, this was actually CHEAPER than any other location we toured! (BRING BACK ALL INCLUSIVE WEDDING VENUES!) We booked it on a Friday, which saved us some money, and chose the sit-down dinner package vs. buffet. Our coordinator and Larry, the owner, were kind and patient throughout the whole planning process, answering any questions I had through email, and spending the extra money to not worry about every little detail was worth every cent. Our wedding was absolutely gorgeous and our guests were blown away by the food and organization of the night. Our coordinator packed up all of the decorations, candles, bridal suite items, and we were able to pick them up in the morning, you DO NOT have to clean up anything yourself at the end of the night! My ONLY issue with the night, was the service. Not that it was POOR, but that it was TOO good. Our guests weren't allowed to finish their drinks or food before a member of the wait staff swooped in and grabbed ANY unattended drink. Guests complained to me later, that they weren't finished with their meals and staff were impatiently waiting/insisting on clearing the tables. Now, I completely understand the hustle of trying to keep up with guests, however, I wish the staff SLOWED DOWN. As the bride and groom, we had our drinks snatched away from our sweetheart table before we were able to finish them, throughout the night. The staff also tossed out time capsule cards and QR photo cards our guests were supposed to fill out/keep before they could get to them. Bottom line, this venue is incredible, and while it's pricier up front, do your research/math if you're leaning more towards an a la carte wedding/reception, Constantino's may be a more affordable option, especially for all the additions they provide, including making custom requests you'd like to add to your ceremony/reception.

We couldnt be happier with Encks. Kim was wonderful to work with in going over the menu and logistics of the day. All of our guests raved about the food. I was up last to get food from the buffet because I was doing my rounds to say hi to all of my guests and one of the servers was kind enough to offer to take my dinner plate to my table so I could get from the salad bar as well and not try to juggle 2 plates. I asked the staff if they could go around before cocktail hour and turn on the lights I had inside mason jars for my center peices and they of course were very accommodating to me. We are 100% pleased with our experience from Encks. Thank you Kim & staff.

We were told over and over again by many vendors and planners how amazing the food at JDK is! Let me tell you - they were right! The food was unbelievable and still has my guests talking about it! The buttermilk chicken breast was to die for. They also nailed my hors d'oeuvres preferences - grilled cheese bar and pierogi station! And the night was complete with our build-your-own ice cream station. The service was impeccable and the staff was all so kind. Even the bartenders were fantastic and did amazing jobs with our signature drinks and beyond. I will say that we went over budget with JDK but don't regret it one bit - we absolutely got the delicious food and quality service that we paid for.

My wife & I would recommend Monteverde's to anyone & everyone over and over again! Kelly is BEYOND wonderful & made our day so special. She made sure to grab us a plate from our cocktail hour since we missed the entire thing for pictures, we never once had to get up to get our food, AND she even made sure to ask both sets of grandparents so they did not have to walk with full plates given their limitations! Since day one Kelly has been nothing but the BEST! Her staff are all lovely, we went through them for bar services too and the bartenders were sweethearts! Kelly made sure to get us everything we wanted even down to color flatware that matched our colors so nicely. She even brought extra cookie trays & displayed all of our cookies for us. The food was absolutely delicious & ALL of our guests raved about the food all night & wanted seconds, even THIRDS! I would recommend them over and over again, any day. Kelly & her crew were god sent angels and we LOVED working with her. Kelly truly is a shining light on your big day!!

Joe and the ginger babies team was the BEST EVER for our wedding. We had a dry wedding so food was really important to us so our guests were full and happy! We went all out and Joe happily accommodated and provided EVERYTHING we wanted and more. We talked many times throughout and had meetings and he was always so workable and reliable. Joe also catered our wedding shower. Everything was beautiful and delicious for both events. He also provided a brunch for morning of for the bridal and groom suites. It was amazing! We got so many compliments on the food. We didn’t have many leftovers! We actually didn’t have leftovers of most things… and there was plenty of food! Which I heard from most other couples that there’s always a ton of leftovers. Safe to say everyone loved the food! Not only that, we also got compliments on the service and servers that day too. Everyone was so kind and helpful. Everything flowed smoothly and my husband and I had no worries! We are so happy with our decision to book gingerbabies. Everything went perfectly. We would do it over again and would recommend them to everyone for any event! Thank you so much Joe!

The event went well. Exceeded my expectations. John Serock took the main things that you worry about most and handled them; table linens, plating, silverware, hors d'oeuvres, Mains, desert and cake through their partner. They listened to my concerns and assuaged any fears. Their staff was friendly and attentive. All the guests loved the ladies at the bar - Hey Rose! The hors d'oeuvres received rave reviews - especially the Mini Grilled Cheese & Tomato Bisque Shooter and the Hoisin Braised Short Rib Bao Buns. Guests raved at how abundant the appetizers were at cocktail hour and that they weren't that hungry at the reception. For our mains, we chose the buffet and there was no more Stuffed Flounder at the end. I think this was the most popular choice. MaryAnn made sure that I always had a full cup and choice of food. No matter where I was, she found me and made sure that I was taken care of. Sarah was our coordinator, and she was so relaxed and affirming that it was calming. As a bride without a wedding planner, it was nice to have Sarah available to offer guidance.

Kate and the entire team at Common Plea Catering are amazing! They made the whole process of planning the food and drinks for our wedding at Heinz History Center so easy. Kate was so easy to communicate with and she ensured that we got exactly what we wanted. They were so accommodating with any requests we made. And the food was OUTSTANDING! We knew the food was good at the tasting but it was just as good if not better for the actual wedding! We had people coming up to us all night raving about how amazing their meals were! The bartenders were fabulous and so efficient while also making delicious drinks. We are so grateful for all of CPC for going above and beyond to help make our special day a dream come true!
