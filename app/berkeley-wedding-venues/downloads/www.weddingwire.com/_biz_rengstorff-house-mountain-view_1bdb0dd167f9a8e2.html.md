## About

Rengstorff House is a fully-restored historic wedding venue located in Mountain View, California. As Mountain View’s oldest home, this venue is one of the best examples of Victorian Italianate architecture on the West Coast. Surrounded by a 750-acre wildlife and recreation area and featuring historic charm, natural garden areas, brick patios and 19th-century décor and furnishings, the Rengstorff House is the perfect setting for a secluded and intimate wedding with the ambience of a bygone era.  
  
**Facilities and Capacity**  
Fully restored in 1991, the Rengstorff House features a Victorian Italianate design with a hip roof, central gable crowned by a widow’s walk, front portico, ornate brass chandeliers, Victorian plaster rosettes and a symmetrical room layout. The gracious dining room and four lovely downstairs parlors are all decorated with classic period décor and open up to brick patios surrounded by manicured lawns, blooming flowers, a charming lakeside area and natural scenery. Three distinct lawn areas provide additional event space, and an on-site restored windmill and water tower structure serves as a unique location for wedding photos.   
  
**Services Offered**  
Rengstorff House offers venue rental for weddings and other social events. While the majority of events typically occur outdoors, guest can enjoy perusing indoors to take a brief step back in time. Event services offered include the following:  


  * Reserved parking with 23 dedicated spaces and overflow parking  

  * An elegant white wedding arch  

  * Modern catering kitchen for warming and serving food  

  * Designated couple’s suite  

  * Approved outside vendors or option to self-cater  

  * Wireless internet access  




**Other Services**  
Rengstorff House is an ideal location for hosting private parties of varying sizes. In addition to wedding ceremonies and receptions, this location can accommodate all of your wedding events, such as engagement parties, bridal showers and rehearsal dinners. This venue is also available for hosting corporate meetings, holiday parties, birthdays, anniversaries and other special occasions.  
  
**History**  
On a site framed by orchards and the San Francisco Bay, rancher and entrepreneur Henry Rengstorff and Christine Hassler-Rengstorff set about building a family home in a quiet setting. When Rengstorff died in 1906 at age 77, his daughter and her husband moved into the family home. Saved from destruction and then beautifully furnished by a community-based organization, this structure is available for public tours.   
  
**Location**  
The Rengstorff House is located within Shoreline at Mountain View, a 750-acre wildlife and recreation area on the edge of the San Francisco Bay. Nearby, you will find the Shoreline Lake, Golf Links and two classic eateries to enjoy and explore.

Stunning venue!

We're wedding florists (Flowers Valley) and for us working at the Rengstorff House was a delight. The staff was accommodating and professional, and the venue provided a stunning setting for our floral designs. Highly recommend for any event!

Beautiful Historic Venue

The venue was an absolutely adorable venue. The oldest house in Mountain View, CA is now historically preserved. If you’re looking for a garden type wedding, this is probably your venue. It’s also right off of Shoreline lake which allows for some magical pictures. We absolutely loved it there.

A great local venue!

Such a beautiful BEAUTIFUL location to have our wedding this October. We loved how many different spaces the venue had to use for the wedding - we were able to move from one lawn for the ceremony (they had a pretty arch that we could use), the front lawn for reception (where we had lawn games), and the west lawn for dinner, and the brick patio was great for dancing. The inside of the house was also beautiful - it was the perfect place to get ready with my bridesmaids. After dinner, our guests could also walk to the nearby park and enjoy the sunset.  
  
We had around 100 people and it was perfect for that size! Loved the venue and would definitely recommend

Gorgeous, Affordable Venue

There are not enough words to describe how much I loved having our wedding at Rengstorff House. I remember visiting it for the first time while venue hunting and knew this was the place for us to exchange vows. There are so many beautiful spots and shots: the house (indoors and outdoors), the bridge, the lawns, the lake (we had a beautiful pink sunset which our photographer caught), the windmill... My sister said upon her first venue visit that the pictures online don't do it justice, even though they are great. So many people came up to us and commented on how they loved it. It was the perfect backdrop to my wedding vision.   
  
Kristina, the venue coordinator, was great. She was always available to answer any questions that I had, no matter how dumb it may have sounded. Since I have not planned something at this level, it was amazing to have someone like her to walk me through this important process.   
  
The cost for the venue is affordable considering how expensive they are nowadays. However, you are only paying for the grounds. They do offer an arch for free, which is very convenient. However, you will need to rent tables, chairs, lighting, tablecloths, decor, tableware, flatware, etc. It can add up so make sure to budget and plan accordingly. In the end, it was completely worth it to me. I would not change anything about that day

Gorgeous Venue

I looked around for a while and when I walked the Rengstorff House I fell in love and knew this was what I had been looking for! Kristina is awesome, she helped me with all my questions and made sure she was there for me through it all. It’s beautiful lawns have the right space. I had my ceremony on the side of the house, cocktails on the front and the dinner and dance on the opposite side. Everyone was I love with the layout and enjoyed taking pictures throughout. I loved that i didn’t have to go any where for pictures as there are many locations onsite! Thank you Kristina! Thank you Rengstorff House for allowing me to celebrate this important day of my life there!

Rengstorff was a perfect venue. Exactly what we wanted and the staff was friendly and helped us leading up to the date if they could. For the cost of the venue it’s great, very affordable for the Bay Area.

This is the most beautiful venue. I knew that I loved it when I first did a site visit. It wasn't until I went to a wedding faire here that I really fell in love with it. The lighting was perfect and I envisioned a beautiful outdoor wedding. They are very helpful and respond well. The value of this place is PHENOMENAL. I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful venue and for such a great price.

The Rengstorff House is at the end of the Shoreline Park. The price is very reasonable ($200/hr) and it is such a beautiful venue to host a small & cozy garden or indoor wedding in this old Victorian style luxurious place.

The Rengstorff House is a beautiful venue. It is secluded from the lake and the road so you feel like you're in a private garden. The house is open and they allow you the option of letting your guests walk through and enjoy the rooms. However you can choose to restrict access if you want to save it just for your bridal party.   
  
We had our ceremony and reception at the venue. The kitchen is small but since we just had a dessert reception our caterers were able to make it work. The kitchen window opens out onto a porch that leads into the back lawn area for easy passing of dishes to be set up.  
  
We had our ceremony on the smaller lawn which fits about 150 chairs. Then moved the reception to the larger lawn and had a few tables, but the majority of the seating were chairs circled around umbrellas. Worked out wonderfully.  
  
There is always a nice breeze from the lake, making even the hottest days more bearable.  
  
The staff was responsive and helpful and were always responded quickly to my emails.  
  
I highly recommend this venue -- I have received countless compliments on the venue and how pleasant it was. There is plenty of parking at Shoreline lake and it takes less than a minute to walk from there to the house.   
  
It's affordable and beautiful and your guests will love it!

What can I say about Rengstorff House as a venue? It's beautiful and clean and, above all, QUIET (unless there's an event at Shoreline Amphitheatre -- double check those dates). It's easy to find and has plenty of parking. My husband and I walked past this historic site all the time with our friends out on walks, so when the time came to choose a venue, it was our first choice. It took us less than two weeks to reach out with our interest, get available dates, and send in a contract with our deposit. Our coordinator helped us take care of the rest of the details after that point. The only small issue we had was some confusion during the transition in points of contact at the venue, as the person we initially worked with went on maternity leave, but was still back to work in time for our wedding. If you're looking for a venue-only (they provide nothing more than the location and wedding arch if you request it), I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this location to anyone looking for a quiet, outdoor setting without hassle.
