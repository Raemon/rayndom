Tom was an incredible DJ! We got married at Castle in the Clouds and he was highly recommended by the staff there. His booking process was incredibly easy, the online portal was very handy and made it easy to pay, pick songs we liked and didn’t like, and review a timeline for the day of. He was there for us via text, email, or phone call leading up to the wedding. Tom worked with all of the staff to ensure things ran smoothly and my goodness they certainly did! Tom played everything we could have wanted to hear on our wedding night and did a great job avoiding songs on our “Do Not Play” list. We essentially had background music playing from the moment guests arrived for the ceremony, to the moment they left the reception. It felt like a movie! He also sent us photos he took which was really nice to see his perspective of our wedding. If you’re considering Tom as your DJ, I highly recommend him he will not steer you wrong!

DJ Jodi was an absolute highlight of our wedding weekend! From our first interaction, she was a joy to work with. Her approach was incredibly thoughtful, detailed, and caring, which made the entire process feel effortless and relaxed. She kept the entire weekend running smoothly, and we couldn't have been happier with her professionalism and amazing energy. Without our knowledge, DJ Jodi even recorded all of all the toasts and speeches. That was our one regret and a few days after DJ Jodi surprised us with these recordings! She truly went above and beyond on the planning and prepping everyone for their toasts so they were confident and comfortable. With immense gratitude, we would glowingly recommend DJ Jodi to anyone and everyone we know getting married in Maine. She is truly amazing at what she does.

Roger did a wonderful job at our wedding! He was professional and kept the night very lively! Our only issue was for the mother/son and father/daughter dance he held his phone to the mic so the dances were a bit too quiet. Other than that he had everyone on the dance floor having a great night! We would definitely recommend!

We had a wonderful experience working with Mike from Audio Events! Mike was kind, easy-going, and flexible. We changed our order of events multiple times during our wedding day, and Mike took everything in stride and was organized and professional during every unforeseen change. Even before our wedding day, Mike helped keep us organized with emailed checklists, planning, meetings, and expert advice. Our guests, after our reception, complimented us highly on the music and MC work, and the amazing time they had. We are so happy with Mike and the DJ service he provided!!!

We had the pleasure of working with Pete for our recent wedding, and we couldn't be happier with the experience! From the very beginning, Pete was a true professional—clear, responsive, and incredibly helpful throughout the entire planning process. He made us feel confident and at ease, and it was clear that he genuinely cared about making our day perfect. On the big day, Pete absolutely nailed it. He kept the energy high and the dance floor packed all night long! His ability to read the crowd and adjust the music accordingly was spot on—every song felt perfectly timed, and our guests had an absolute blast. He also has a fantastic MC voice, striking the right balance between fun and professional, and was great at keeping everything flowing smoothly, even when we needed to shift the timeline a bit. We also added on a photo booth option, which turned out to be a huge hit! Pete’s son, Pete Jr., did an awesome job running it—friendly, organized, and super helpful with guests. Overall, we can't recommend DJ Pete enough. He played such a big role in making our wedding celebration so memorable, and we’re incredibly grateful for his talent and flexibility. If you’re looking for a DJ who truly delivers, Pete is a great option.

We had the best experience working with DJ Chris from Crown Events for our wedding! From the very beginning, he was so professional and willing to hop on calls before the big day to make sure we felt comfortable and everything was lined up exactly how we wanted. On the wedding day, he absolutely delivered—he kept the energy up, engaged all of our guests, and created such a fun atmosphere. The dance floor was packed all night, and we received so many compliments about the music. We couldn’t have asked for a better DJ to make our celebration so memorable. Highly recommend DJ Chris and Crown Events!

Aaron was a professional, fast responder, easy to communicate with, and kept us on time. We hired him for our wedding in Oct in NH. We added in a violinist as he plays the piano for ceremony/cocktail hour. Unfortunately, due to the weather, it was just a little too cold to have them play for the ceremony so we switched to a soundtrack. We were still able to pick out instrumental versions of the songs we wanted and they sounded great. Cocktail hour they were moved inside to play live. He provided the mic for the officiant. We were able to send him do-not-play and must-play lists and they were followed great. I was more picky about reception music and throughout the night I heard everything I wanted and received compliments all night on the music. Everything was perfect and would highly recommend him!

Ben Bostock was an excellent DJ! He took the time to get to know us and our style of music. He accommodated us for the vibes we were trying to set, especially with our wedding being much smaller and with guests being of older age. During the event Ben was excellent at checking in with us and ensuring everything was on schedule. He also took charge and coordinated with the photographer for the first dance and speeches. Overall the experience and services were phenomenal. Thank you Ben!!

Nazzy was awesome! He listened to everything we wanted and made our wedding perfect! He was even able to play a video of our Best Man’s speech who wound up not being able to be there in person. The music was great and he had people on the dance floor all night long, and the Photo Booth was a hit! Might be a little biased here, but it was the best party I’ve ever been to!
