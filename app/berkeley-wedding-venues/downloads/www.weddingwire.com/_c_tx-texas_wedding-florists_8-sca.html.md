If you want someone to help uncover and fulfill your flower dreams - Bloom House ATX is for you! As a scientist, floral arrangements ( and lets be real here, anything artistic) have never been my forte. That's why I knew I needed to hire someone with excellent taste to transform my wedding venue. Domenica, the owner and artistic lead for Bloom House ATX, patiently guided and advised at every step. The process was lovely and the end result was incredible. She is caring, knowledgeable and her taste in flower arrangements is beyond elegant and sophisticated. Look no further if you want to support a local Austin woman artist and want your flowers to enchant and wow your guests.

Melissa White from Botanica was absolutely fabulous. She demonstrated the upmost professionalism and listened to exactly what we wanted for my daughters wedding. The florals at the church and reception were gorgeous. She had everything and every detail covered. She had lots of great ideas and it was obvious she has done this for a long time. I highly recommend Botanika and Melissa White. Expectations exceeded!

Angie’s flowers provided beautiful flowers for our recent wedding. The whole process was seamless from the initial appointment of choosing flowers to the day of the wedding. They knew how to balance out budget while still giving us our vision for the wedding. Very happy to have used them for our special day!

Haute was really great to work with and made the process so easy! We got so many compliments from our guests. We absolutely loved the arch, and the team were very accommodating in helping us work books into our centerpieces. I would highly recommend!

My daughter and I couldn't have imagined more perfect flowers, they were just gorgeous! My daughter's bouquet was stunning and exactly what she had dreamed of! As were all the bouquets, centerpieces, etc. Rebeckah quickly captured the vision and style my daughter wanted for her wedding and truly made the dream come true. Rebeckah and her team were also so friendly and helpful from the first phone call through to the end, we can't recommend them enough.

Planning a wedding in a different state is no easy task, but Tami scheduled a phone call to understand my vision and the end result was a thousand times more beautiful than I could ever imagine. As soon as she showed me my bridal bouquet I couldn’t stop smiling. All my bouquets and venue flowers were absolutely stunning and I got so many compliments!!!

John and his florals were amazing!!! I was overwhelmed with the flower choices, and I wasn’t really sure how to describe what I wanted. During our consultation, John brought out different flowers, made makeshift bouquets and table set ups, and lent his creative eye. It was so fun, and he nailed my vision! The flowers were gorgeous the day of the wedding. We even had to make some changes a couple weeks before the wedding, and he was more than willing to do so. We visited a few other florists, and he was BY FAR the best and was the most affordable. We are so glad we used John!
