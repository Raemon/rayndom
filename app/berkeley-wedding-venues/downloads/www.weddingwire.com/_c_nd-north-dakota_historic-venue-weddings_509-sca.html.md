Bonanzaville is the place to be with its great facilities and awesome staff. Our wedding was put together in a short amount of time and we couldn't have done it without the help of Bonanzaville, they were cooperative and accommodating in so many different ways. Our winter wedding came with additional challenges, but that was not a concern thanks to the diligent help from the skilled staff at Bonanzaville. They allowed us to personalize the venue in order to create our vision, and thanks to the charm of the historical buildings, both inside and out, Bonanzaville holds an abundance of great photo opportunities! From the buildings themselves to the smallest details, everything came together absolutely perfect. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to hold our once in a lifetime event.

NDSU Alumni Center was perfect for our open house reception. It is very open and spacious and has great parking close to the building. The cost was not bad at all either. They have specific caterers and bar that they typically go through. I planned on going with MSUM catering and they were one of the main options (very good food and Judith is wonderful!). However, Green Mill is the only bar they use for alcohol and they weren't the best to work with. Everyone loved the venue and we received many compliments for how we hosted the open house reception and what a good venue it was for it. I highly recommend this venue for a wedding/reception.
