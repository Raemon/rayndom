One of the Best Decisions We Made

We had lots of music at our ceremony but for our processional we wanted to make that unique. We chose to have strings played. It made a nice separation and our entrance special. Virginia James (Chris and Alicia) nailed it. My wife wanted a unique song which they learned just for her. It was beautiful and brought tears to my eyes. Virginia James brought all their own equipment and were set up well before the ceremony. They were also one of our vendors who checked in several times leading up to the wedding. Leaving us with no questions and a quiet confidence of what we will get on the day. They are the sweetest pair and we couldn't be more grateful that we found them. Thank you Alicia and Chris for everything.

Highly Recommend! 

We had the privilege of working with Alicia & Chris for our wedding ceremony, and we are so grateful with our decision to have them as part of our special day. They are incredibly kind, professional & talented. From the beginning we appreciated them taking the time to have a video call with us to discuss our vision. They were able to learn a special song my husband wanted to walk down the aisle too, as well as mix instrumental and vocals which added an element of fun! We highly recommend Virginia James Music to be apart of your wedding day, or any other event you need live music for!

Amazing ceremony and cocktail hour music!

Alicia and Chris were absolutely incredible in providing the music for our wedding ceremony and cocktail hour. They were responsive, friendly, professional, and a pleasure to work with. We had a church wedding, and they went above and beyond by coordinating with the parish’s music coordinator well in advance, ensuring every detail of the ceremony music was exactly as we envisioned. I highly recommend Virginia James for any bride/grooms in the Rhode Island area!

Amazingly talented musicians who are super friendly too!

Wow!! Alicia and Chris made our wedding so magical with their incredible musical talents!! We would highly recommend them to anyone that wants that special addition to their event! We knew from the start of planning that we wanted live music for our ceremony and cocktail hour. When we met Alicia and Chris, we knew they were the ones to deliver. Besides being incredibly kind and easy to talk to, their musical repertoire is sooooo comprehensive! We wanted a mixture of nerdy theme songs (like Lord of the rings), oldies like Neil Young, and newer hits as well. Alicia and Chris were able to perform all of them beautifully! Even two months after the wedding, we are still getting so many compliments regarding their music- it is definitely one of the highlights of the day! We highly recommend Alicia and Chris for anyone looking to add beautiful music, performed by kind hearted people who will make your event that much more special 😊 Thank you both so much for everything!!

10/10 Best choice we made! 

I cannot express enough how grateful we are for Alicia and Chris who played at our wedding ceremony at Greenville Vineyards. The combination of guitar and violin created the most enchanting atmosphere that perfectly complemented our outdoor setting.  
  
From the moment we reached out to them, their professionalism and passion for music were evident. They took the time to understand our vision and even offered suggestions that truly elevated our ceremony. On the day of the wedding, their performance was absolutely stunning. Many of our guests commented on how beautiful the music was, and it truly set the tone for a magical day.  
  
Thank you for contributing to our special moment in such a profound way. You helped make our wedding unforgettable, and I wholeheartedly recommend their services to anyone looking to add a touch of elegance to their event!
