The Daisy Shop at The Shops at Devereux in Devon, PA is an amazing place to see creativity and inclusion join hands to make employment opportunities for adults with disabilities. Londyn is the florist at The Daisy Shop. She has only the freshest flowers to put in her very creative arrangements. Clients participate by helping in the shop and by delivering arrangements to customers. I have personally had The Daisy Shop provide centerpieces for a wedding shower and a baby shower. London gladly made samples for my approval prior to each event. It is fun to stop in the shop to pick up a bouquet for my home or for a friend who may need a "pick me up". I highly recommend Th Daisy Shop for all of your floral needs. You will be very satisfied with Londyn's creations while helping to provide employment opportunities for adults with disabilities.

Working with Richard made finding the right flowers for our wedding so easy with his responsiveness to messages, tips, and general guidance throughout the months leading to the wedding. Not only that, but the flowers for the ceremony and reception were stunning! Since we got married in a garden, we wanted something elegant and accentuated the venue, which worked out perfectly with the selection of flowers we ended up going with. I'd absolutely recommend All Event's Floral to anyone in the area looking for a reliable florist for their events, as their work will go above and beyond expectations, and for a good price.

Gina at GMK Floral Designs is a true artist. Our wedding florals were beyond what we could have ever imagined — breathtaking, lush, and personal in every possible way. From the very beginning, Gina worked closely with us to tailor everything to our vision and our budget, offering creative ideas on scaling, repurposing, and making a big visual impact without overspending. Every question I had, she was already three steps ahead — her organization, communication, and care are unmatched. Gina is not only exceptionally talented but also kind, fair, and a joy to collaborate with. The next morning, when I saw her gorgeous arrangements again in the daylight, I actually teared up all over again — they were that beautiful. I would recommend her to anyone without hesitation — five stars is not enough!

My Daughter's decision to book GIDAS FLOWERS for her wedding was the best decision she could have made! From the very first visit, I felt like Amy went out of her way to listen to exactly what she wanted, to show us each of the flowers we were planning to use (no other florist did this), and to make suggestions, based on their own experiences. When the flowers arrived on my daughter's wedding day, they were EXQUISITE, probably THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS I HAVE EVER SEEN! There were very few fillers and mostly beautiful high-quality roses and ranunculus. GIDAS FLOWERS made the tables, the wedding arch, the table seating chart, the cake, and the bridal party's, mother's, and grandmother's bouquets stunning. Everything together made the venue look magical! I am a type A, very picky personality, and honestly there isn't anything I would change. I will add pictures shortly so you can see for yourselves. Book GIDAS FLOWERS for your wedding, so it can be the best decision you ever make!

Pod Shop absolutely nailed the vision for our late October wedding. From my first phone call with Kim, I knew I was in excellent hands. I described a very vague image of what I wanted, and without skipping a beat, she understood what I wanted and made it absolutely come to life. The bouquets, centerpieces, chuppah, and other adornments really made every detail shine, and we received compliments all weekend about the stunning autumnal flowers. I cannot recommend Pod Shop enough!

My husband and I had the best experience working with Mark. We came into the process not even really having the language to describe what we were thinking for our wedding florals, and with Mark’s expert help we were able to see our vision come to life. He could not be more pleasant to work with, and our florals were absolutely stunning. We felt totally taken care of, and did not feel pressured to do or spend anything we didn’t feel comfortable with. We cannot recommend Mark Bryan Designs more strongly - they’re great people who do incredible work, and you will not be disappointed.

Greg from Carl Alan helped us create the flowers of my dreams for our September 2024 wedding. Instead of the typical fall colors I chose a sunset color scheme for the end of summer (pinks, oranges, yellow). They turned out better than I could have ever imagined. Greg & the Carl Alan team were extremely responsive, professional but kept it fun, detailed, and really made what can be a daunting (and pricey) task pretty enjoyable. After reaching out and sending in our vision board, about 7-8 months out we met with Greg in the office and he had a fully detailed outline for us with pictures and prices all ready to walk through and discuss. He took us through the warehouse where they have almost every hardware option you could think of! We went through and picked which ones with liked and then we were on our way. Then about a month and a half out he reached out to start to nail down the finer details, we had another phone call to answer the logistical questions and it was as easy as that! And then came the wedding day...... everyone tells you that no one notices the flowers. Well they are wrong. The compliments on the flowers were endless. People were absolutely blown away. The bouquets were perfect, the colors were SPOT ON, and the centerpieces just pulled the room together like no other. I'm so glad I went with Carl Alan I would do it over again 1000x.
