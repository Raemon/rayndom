Pricing varies based on factors including, but not limited to, vendor’s experience, level of expertise, event guest count, date, and geographic region.

## How much do wedding flowers cost?

Your wedding florist will make your wedding day even more beautiful by providing gorgeous [floral arrangements](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-flower-arrangements-shopping-list). Depending on your style and needs, your wedding flowers cost will vary, but the average cost of wedding flowers in the U.S. is around $1,500 with most couples spending between $700 and $2,500. Note that there is a wide range for the cost of wedding flowers, which is based on both where you’re getting married as well as the types and quantities of flowers you want for your wedding day.

## How much is a bride's bouquet?

When it comes to bridal bouquets, the cost will vary depending on the types of flowers you want to include, and the arrangement’s size and complexity. The average cost of a bridal bouquet is $160.

## How much is a bridesmaid's bouquet?

Bridesmaid bouquets tend to be smaller and less expensive than bridal bouquets. The average cost for a bridesmaid bouquet is $75.

## What services does a wedding florist provide?

A [wedding florist provides a variety of services](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-flower-arrangements-shopping-list), some of which might not be obvious at first.

  * Consultation: Your wedding florist will meet with you to discuss your vision for your wedding—your venue, your wedding style, your desired color palette, and the types of flowers you like and dislike. Your florist will then create a proposal which will describe the arrangements he or she will create as well as the prices.
  * Samples: After you’ve signed a contract and shortly before your wedding, your florist may also provide sample arrangements to ensure that you’re on the same page about how your wedding-day flowers will look.
  * Flowers: A big part of your wedding flower budget will go to the actual purchasing of the flowers. It actually takes several hours for a florist to put a flower order together—and the flowers your florist will receive from his or her wholesaler or grower are far better quality than the ones you can buy at your local grocery store. They’re grown especially to be featured at events and are hand-selected for their quality.
  * Flower processing and storage: Once your flowers arrive to your florist, he or she will take several hours (often a whole day!) to process your flowers (taking thorns off of roses, counting the flowers, etc.) and storing them in a refrigerated space to ensure they look amazing on your wedding day.
  * Labor and production: Now, it’s time for your florist to create those beautiful arrangements! Each arrangement takes time to design (probably more than you would think!), so it’s quite a long process.
  * Delivery and set up: Your florist and his/her team will then bring your arrangements to your venue. A good amount of work needs to be done on premises to make sure that your ceremony and reception looks picture-perfect, from the altar to the reception table arrangements.
  * Cleanup: After your wedding, your florist and his/her team will go to your venue to remove all of the arrangements and vessels, and assist with cleanup.



## When should I hire a wedding florist?

We recommend hiring your wedding florist early on in the planning process, at least eight months before your wedding day. Start by [reading online reviews of florists](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-florists) in your wedding location, and then narrow down the list to a few that you’d like to reach out to and meet with. 

## What questions should I ask a wedding florist before hiring?

When first meeting with a wedding florist, it’s important to get a sense of his or her experience, creativity, and personality—as well as his or her wedding flowers cost. Here are some [questions to be sure to ask a wedding florist](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-questions-to-ask-your-wedding-florist):

  * How many weddings have you done?
  * Can you offer some suggestions for creating the look I want?
  * Can you work with my wedding flower budget?
  * Do you have other weddings booked on my wedding weekend?
  * Can I see a portfolio?
  * How do you store your flowers?
  * How do you transport the flowers?
  * Are there additional fees?
  * Will you provide samples before my wedding date?
  * Which other items (vessels, rentals, etc.) can you provide, and which will I have to source myself?



## Do I have to tip my florist?

Florists do not typically receive tips, but you should tip the delivery people who set up your floral arrangements at least $5 to $20 per person. Be sure to include room in your wedding flower [budget for these tips](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-tipping-guide), and don’t forget to write [an online review](https://www.weddingwire.com/shared/rate?formEntryPoint=40) of your wedding florist after your big day. 

## How much of my budget should I allocate for wedding flowers?

Typically, wedding flowers, décor, and lighting comprise about eight percent of a couple’s total wedding budget—so be sure to [plan to spend accordingly](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-budget-breakdown)! 

## Do certain wedding flowers cost more?

The average cost of flowers for a wedding varies so widely because there are so many different types of flowers! The most expensive flowers include peonies, gardenias, and hydrangeas. If you’re on a tight wedding flower budget, using [lots of greenery](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/12-ways-to-decorate-with-greenery) is an affordable (and on-trend!) way to decorate your reception. Other inexpensive flowers include freesia, baby’s breath, roses (not garden roses, though), daisies, and carnations. 

## How can I save money on my wedding flowers?

If the average price for wedding flowers seems high, there are several easy ways to [have amazing floral arrangements without costing a lot](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/5-ways-to-save-money-on-wedding-flowers)! Here are a few of our favorites:

  * Choose [seasonal flowers](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/12-wedding-flowers-that-are-always-in-season)
  * Reuse ceremony arrangements (bouquets, altar arrangements, etc.) in your reception
  * Mix flowers with non-floral elements like greenery or candles
