## About

**I am retiring after 26 years of joyful weddings. I turn 80 June 23, 2019.**  
**Intimate romantic weddings in my home by appointment only**  
  
 _**intimate Weddings Here in our Home.**_ Once again we can offer weddings at a rate of $200 for those who want a quiet, ceremony in our home at 4947 Ringer Road, St. Louis, MO 63129. You can have up to 8 people with you (limited parking) In addition to completing all the legal requirements, I will give you a bound copy of your wedding. With 24 hours notice in advance, I enjoy creating a wreath of fresh roses, ivy and herbs for you to keep. I have married couples in Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Arizona, Virginia and in Italy.

Just so you have a basis for comparison in contacting other officiants, I offered weddings anywhere at a standard rate of $350 with exception of winery weddings which are $400. A deposit of $50 is required to secure a date and time. The balance is due on the day of your rehearsal. Long distance weddings required lodging and travel expenses. My ceremonies were romantic and fun--not rote. 

Only failing health and turning 80 has caused me to make this decision.

**PLEASE NOTE:if there should be an emergency such as an officiant dropping out ( or dropping dead) I will be available to you. I just don't want to make long term committmentsdue my husband's health.**

Sandy will tailor the ceremony to your specific values, morals, and personalities. Many of our guests said it was the best ceremony they've ever attended. She spoke in words that we understood and felt comfortable making our vows to. She made it touching, funny, and so heartfelt. All of us (including the groom and myself) were laughing and crying. I'm so grateful we chose someone who spoke of our relationship on such a personal level. Sandy is a gem- you will not find a better person to be your officiant!

After Sandy performed our ceremony, we kept getting pulled aside by guests to tell us how great she was! She's the perfect blend of humorous and serious! The flower crown is a great touch. And worth every bit of $350, by far NOT the most expensive officiant you'll Google. If you want your guests to be entertained instead of bored out of their minds at "just another wedding", get Sandy. You won't regret it!

Sandy was absolutely wonderful. You could tell she truly loves what she does and cares to make your day as magical as you've imagined it. We were so lost on how the ceremony would go and she made us so comfortable. We kept getting comments all night about how much everyone loved her! And most importantly, so did we!

Everything about Sandy and what she does is amazing. I saw her marry one of our family friends and was in love with the ceremony and at the time I told my parents no matter who I end up marrying, she will be the one to do it for us! She is the funniest, most kind and caring lady. Everything about our ceremony was amazing and received so many compliments on her! I could listen to her for hours, she has her way of talking and honestly I could never get bored. Thank you so much for everything Sandy, Eric and I only wish to have what you and Bob have! I will miss our random email exchanges! Love you!!!

I cannot speak highly enough of the people who made our wedding so special and unique. Sandy and her husband Bob are an incredibly gracious, kind, and generous couple. It is apparent this is Sandy's calling, as although she makes what she does appear so very natural, we know the effort and time she put into making our day beautifully memorable. She and her husband opened their home and hearts to us, and through inviting us to do the same, she created an amazing, individualized ceremony for us. We are so glad we made the choice to contact her and have her carefully chosen words, oozing of wisdom, as the poetry accompanying the start of our lives together. We will never forget how they treated us, and made us feel on one of the most important days of our lives.

Rev. Sandy was the best choice for us. We spent a while getting to know each other, she really took an interest in us and our families. Not to mention the attention she paid to our style and religious preferences. She was able to customize our ceremony to fit US and our personalities. She's very responsive and reliable. On top of all this, she's amazing at officiating, her personality and sense of humor made our ceremony not only special but it wasn't BORING! Can you believe it? People will be talking about our ceremony for a long time thanks to Rev. Sandy. We absolutely love her like family.

AMAZING. Had so many compliments on Sandy and our ceremony. It was so perfect and made just for us. She gave us a book of every word of our ceremony and her husband took pictures as a bonus! She sent us the CD of the pictures within a week! She was so amazing and genuine and really got to know us prior to the ceremony. We were a little off the beaten path as a couple and she catered to us perfectly. I could not have asked for a better ceremony or officiant. She was down right amazing and I would recommend her in a heart beat!

Sandy was truly amazing! She ensured that our wedding was all that we dreamed of. We even threw a curve ball with some surprise homing pigeons and she rolled with it with two days notice! She was witty and made our guest laugh-it made for a very light-hearted wedding. Just what we were looking for! It felt like we knew her for years! She has interesting stories to tell and is sweet as pie! Thanks for making our day so special.

I contacted Sandy after our original officiant had to back out of our wedding and I was a little concerned that she wouldn't be able to perform the ceremony on shorter-than-average notice, but she was more than willing. She's unique, sweet, entertaining, and very easy to talk with. She performed a ceremony that was personalized just for us and everyone there was speaking fondly of her afterwards. There isn't a single thing I would have asked her to do differently and my husband and I are so happy that we now have memories of a sweet, unique ceremony! I really cannot recommend her enough :)

When we first met Sandy in person we knew that we had found the right officiant for our wedding. She is charming, sweet, and absolutely adorable in every possible way. The extra little details that she put into our ceremony really made it something special. Her words were heartfelt and sincere, and many of our guests told us that it was the best wedding ceremony they had ever witnessed. We couldn't have made a better choice with anyone else. Thank you so much, Sandra!  
  
PS, Keeva wore the crown of flowers for most of the rest of the night, and we plan on getting it framed to keep forever as a special reminder of that incredible day! Thank you thank you thank you!!! :D

I have been referring people to Sandy since the day I met her. My husband and I LOVED her the moment we were introduced, and to this day, almost 7 years later, people still rave about her amazing ceremony for our wedding. She's original, she's hilariously funny, she's brilliant! And above all: she REALLY cares about her couples, and her husband is just as invested in your wedding as she is. Love her!

Sandy provides a heartfelt very meaningful customized wedding ceremony for you! She speaks with authority about love, commitment, and sharing your lives together. With her life's experiences of being a corporate planner, she knows what needs to get done , but delivers it with deep conviction and has everyone thinking and remembering the day that they said "I do". We love having her officiating at both of our venues. She makes what this day is about "The Wedding" the focal point!
