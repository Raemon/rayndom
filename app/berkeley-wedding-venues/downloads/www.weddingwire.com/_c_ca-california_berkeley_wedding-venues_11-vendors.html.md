We recently celebrated our engagement ceremony at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel, Berkeley Marina, and it was an absolute dream come true! From the moment we began planning, the entire team at DoubleTree went above and beyond to ensure every detail was perfect for our special day. Their level of cooperation and collaboration was unparalleled. They worked tirelessly with us, listening attentively to our ideas and desires, and offering valuable insights to make our event truly unforgettable. No detail was too small for them to handle, and their dedication to excellence was evident in every aspect of the planning process. On the day of the event, we were blown away by the professionalism and warmth of the staff. From the event coordinators to the servers, everyone treated us and our guests with the utmost care and respect. They anticipated our needs before we even had to ask, ensuring that everything ran smoothly from start to finish. The venue itself was stunning, with breathtaking views of the Berkeley Marina that provided the perfect backdrop for our celebration. The atmosphere was elegant yet inviting, creating the ideal setting for our special day. We cannot thank the DoubleTree Hilton team enough for their outstanding service and hospitality. They truly exceeded our expectations in every way possible, and we feel incredibly grateful to have chosen them for our engagement ceremony. We wholeheartedly recommend DoubleTree Hilton, Berkeley Marina to anyone seeking a truly exceptional event experience

(Review for catering/events/venue service) I don’t have enough great words for Nicole and her team at Berkeley City Club. I planned my wedding entirely “remotely” from out of state and Nicole was always ready to answer my millions of questions and make sure everything was being planned to perfection. I had actually never seen the hotel in person, and I must say the architecture, foliage, vibes, etc are better and MORE stunning in person than in photos. Truly a breathtaking venue that transports you with its historic arches, details, etc. Wedding food is often lackluster in my experience, but I was thoroughly impressed by all of the plated dinner dishes we were served. My salmon was perfectly cooked and guests complimented their meals as well. They were also able to accommodate all gluten free food as I have celiac disease, which was the cherry on top. Additionally, a special shout out to the staff who worked the event day-of. Everyone was kind with bright smiles, and treated me and everything/everyone else with care.

Compass Rose Charters made our wedding very memorable. Most of our guests had never been to the West Coast, so we figured this would be a perfect way for them to experience the Bay Area. Unfortunately the weather was pretty bad on the day of our wedding so we weren't able to go far, but the crew was so much fun that we didn't even notice. They had great appetizers while we were dancing and waiting for dinner and didn't mind that everyone was on the dance floor and singing. Ken was great at coordinating the extra decorations that I brought and making sure things flowed smoothly thoughout the night. Several people even went up to see the captain and thought that was pretty cool. The only thing that wasn't absolutely perfect was that it took a little while for all the plates to come out for dinner. But in the end everyone did get fed (and got some cake) and I'm sure it's not easy serving 30 people dinner from a ship's kitchen. The food was absolutely delicious and there were several menu options. I am a super picky eater (my friends were proud we weren't serving chicken nuggets and pizza) and I managed to find a meal that appealed to me. I would reccommend keeping a wedding on the smaller side if you plan to get married on the yacht. We had about 30 people and it was perfect. It was cozy, but not overcrowded. The reason that I gave a them a 4.5 on responsiveness is because I had a little trouble getting in contact regarding when I could drop of decorations in advance and whether the bridal party and I would be able to board early. They did get back to me well in advance of the wedding though and everything worked out just fine. Also, we got married right around the Christmas holiday and I'm sure that had something to do with it. Everyone had tons of fun at our wedding and I would defintely use them again for another event. Great food, great venue, and great staff!

We chose this venue because we are members of UUCB community, and we knew that we would be able to collaborate with our ministers about what we wanted in our ceremony. As a lesbian couple, this was important to us. We had the support not only of our ministers, but the music director and staff as well. Of course, the physical space is wonderful: the sanctuary, the atrium, the patio, the Fireside Room - all of it - was perfect for our needs. Since then, I have attended several other weddings at UUCB and can without reservation say that it's always a joy to celebrate in that space.

Chochmat HaLev provides a warm, beautiful intimate venue, perfect for a small and/or informal reception. (They also have a space available for a wedding for those who are Jewish!) They have a no-meat and no shellfish policy because they're a synagogue--check with the staff about appropriate food! The staff itself is warm, professional, patient, and helpful! There's a small, lush garden that can be used as an extension of the Social Hall. Their rental prices are competitive! Can't recommend it highly enough.

We booked this venue for our reception a year in advance. Because it is on campus, we had to find a date that did not conflict with the campus event schedule. Their coordinator changed a couple times before the wedding, but this did not hinder our communication. Our reception turned out perfect, and we could not have asked for a better venue. Unfortunately, our cake topper was misplaced. I loved how they gave us a closet to store our gifts overnight, so we didn't have to worry about hauling them to our car right away. I would definitely have another party here!
