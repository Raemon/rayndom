Truly exceptional planning and execution! 

If you’re looking for an event planner who will go above and beyond to create a beautiful, meaningful, and flawlessly executed celebration, Terri is the one.  
  
She brought my dream engagement party to life and made it even more beautiful than I imagined. Every detail was stunning, personal, and perfectly executed—an unforgettable day I’ll cherish forever.  
  
She didn’t just plan my party, she created a one-of-a-kind celebration that felt like it was made just for me. As a luxury wedding planner and event designer, her eye for detail, creativity, and custom event styling brought my vision to life in ways I never imagined possible. Every flower arrangement, table setting, and decorative touch reflected her heart, vision, and dedication.  
  
From our first conversation to the final toast, her professionalism and warm, organized approach made the planning process completely stress-free. She crafted an unforgettable experience that I, and everyone who attended, will treasure forever.

My daughter’s dream wedding 

Terri was an incredible person to work with. She made planning the wedding a delightful experience, from finding the ideal lighting solution to securing the most amazing vendors, including the band, videographer, and photographer. On the wedding day, she handled a myriad of big and small details, allowing us to simply enjoy the moment. I would highly recommend Terri to anyone planning a wedding.

Best experience

I hired Terri to plan my wedding after attending an event she had planned and seeing how thoughtfully and intentionally she curated every detail and she blew my expectations out of the water!   
  
During my consult Terri took the time to listen and understand not just what I wanted my wedding to look like but how I wanted myself and my guests to feel during every big moment and in each different space. It was the event of my dreams. She had such a beautiful way of bringing my vision to life while also suggesting great ideas and details I never would have thought of.  
She is organized, passionate and communicated with me every step of the way. I got to enjoy my event without worrying how anything would come together. I highly recommend Terri for any event big or small!

An Effortless Event!

We worked with Terri to plan a party and had a great experience. She was communicative, professional, and timely throughout the entire process, and took full ownership of the details. On the day of, we didn’t have to worry about anything. Honestly, it didn’t even feel like we needed to “host”. We were able to truly enjoy our guests and the event itself.  
  
It was clear to us that she approached our event with genuine care and thoughtfulness, and that she was invested in delivering an experience aligned with our vision. She took the time to truly understand who we are and what mattered most to us, and that care was reflected in the final result. I would highly recommend her.
