Eden's professionalism is outstanding. She helped us every step of the way to create a meaningful ceremony unique to us. She was prompt in response and very accomodating. If you are looking for someone to help design an inclusive and welcoming ceremony for all- you need Eden!

We wanted a secular handfasting, Michael has experience in this and provided templates for various ceremonies so we could create one uniquely ours. After the ceremony we even had guests asking for his info so they can use him in the future. He’s worth hiring!

We had the absolute pleasure of having Randy Lioz as our wedding officiant, and he was truly amazing! From the very beginning, Randy went above and beyond to make our ceremony feel personal, heartfelt, and completely us. He took the time to get to know us before the big day and even reached out to some of our family and friends to learn more about who we are as people. Hearing those thoughtful details woven into our ceremony was such a special and emotional moment — it made everything feel so genuine and unique to our story. Randy also shared a few versions of the ceremony in advance and encouraged us to collaborate and make edits, which meant so much to us. It really felt like a team effort, and we appreciated his flexibility and care in making sure everything reflected our personalities and values. On the day of the wedding, Randy was incredible — he delivered the ceremony beautifully in both English and Spanish, allowing all of our guests to feel included and connected. His charisma, warmth, and calm presence instantly put us at ease and made the entire experience unforgettable. We are so grateful to have had Randy as part of our day. We couldn’t have asked for a more thoughtful, genuine, and talented officiant!

We met Mary through The Knot app, and from the moment we connected, it just felt right. Her energy is so warm and gravitating — the same beautiful presence we felt during our virtual meetings carried all the way to our in-person moment on our wedding day. Mary truly won the hearts of our guests. She kept everyone engaged, present, and emotionally connected throughout the ceremony. Her support during the entire planning process was unmatched, and she played a huge role in making the experience far less stressful. By the end of it all, Mary wasn’t just our officiant — she became family. We have zero regrets and endless gratitude for the love, intention, and joy she brought to our day.

Pastor choy was amazing from beginning to end, he made the entire experience painless and very personalized. However we had absolutely no idea what readings/passages to use and he provided many samples, examples from prior weddings. He made it stress free and met with us several times to go over details and a very detailed plan for the day of the wedding. He was a joy to work with and we would highly recommend him to anyone looking for an easy stress free experience for their wedding day. He was sweet, caring , and has a great sense of humor! cannot recommend pastor choy enough!! amazing!!

It's an absolute privilege to recommend Bill and Joanne to other couples. Working with them both was one of the best experiences I have ever had with a vendor, and they created a beautiful and meaningful ceremony for our family. Many of our guests told us it was the best ceremony they've attended, and we couldn't agree more. As a same sex couple who wanted a ceremony that was spiritual and reflective of our religious upbringing, while also respectful to our identities, working with Bill and Joanne was one of the best decisions we could have made. From the first call, they met us with open minds and hearts, and built a ceremony that was rooted in love, respect and reflective of our family's hopes and dreams. They incorporated our three children into the ceremony in a way that engaged them and made it fun and meaningful. I would happily serve as a reference for anyone considering working with them and recommend that you reach out. They brought a tremendous amount of dignity, care and consideration to every interaction and have our utmost gratitude.

We couldn’t have asked for a more wonderful officiant. From our first conversation to the ceremony itself, Joan was warm, professional, and truly invested in making our ceremony meaningful and personal. She took the time to get to know us and crafted a ceremony that perfectly reflected our story and values! The ceremony was beautifully delivered — heartfelt, engaging, and the perfect balance of emotion and joy. So many of our guests commented on how much they loved our officiant and how touching the ceremony was. It felt genuine, memorable, and incredibly special. We are so grateful for the role Joan played in our wedding day and would highly recommend her to any couple looking for an officiant who is thoughtful, kind, and exceptional at what they do!

Rev Louis was exactly what we were looking for in a wedding officiant. He was interested in getting to know us in order to personalize and tailor a ceremony that was right for us. He was sensitive to our personal story and created a welcoming, inclusive and spiritual ceremony for our guests and most importantly for us. Also, he and his wife can really cut a rug on the dance floor!
