Located in San Francisco, California, the Exploratorium is a science museum and wedding venue that offers something different for your “I dos.” The museum was founded by Frank Oppenheimer, a physicist, who was inspired to create a science museum after seeing the quality of European institutions. His personality inspires much of how the museum is run, which seeks to be a place of learning and exploration without pomp. The location provides you and your sweetheart a dynamic place full of possibilities for you to celebrate and showcase your love.

**Facilities and Capacity**

At this museum, you can choose from several galleries for your special day, or you can combine multiple galleries at once. The latter option allows you to host different parts of your wedding in different rooms. You can also rent the entire museum, allowing your guests to discover the many exhibitions. One of the popular spaces at the Exploratorium to host your wedding is the Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery & Terrace. This area affords you views of both the bay and the city. Inside there is a seated capacity for 150. The outside can accommodate 100 guests. This area features an understated design that is angular and contemporary. The space's simplicity and the neutral hues make it the ideal canvas for a variety of decor. This design extends throughout the building. There are also other galleries suited for events, such as Osher West, East, and Bechtal Central. These many options offer versatility and work for gatherings of between 40 and more than 400 people.

**Services Offered**

The Exploratorium employs a team of professionals to work the events at the museum. These individuals use their skills to help make your wedding a success. The museum also provides the catering for your event, crafting dishes and culinary treats to delight your loved ones. You also get access to classrooms for use as dressing rooms, providing convenience to you and your wedding entourage. A gallery can also be closed off for an hour so you may use the space for your wedding photographs. As a bonus, the rental packages also include a one-year membership to the museum.

The perfect wedding experience!

As people who have loved the Exploratorium since we were kids, it was the perfect wedding venue for us! We had the ceremony in the outdoor gallery and the reception in the Central and West galleries. We chose these spaces to prioritize the best exhibits over the best view of the Bay (but the view back into the city was perfect for the ceremony!). Everyone at the Exploratorium was so helpful in the planning stages, expertly answering all questions and helping figure out some complicated logistics with dropping off and picking up decorations (we did all the flowers and decorations ourselves). The day went so smoothly - the timeline was tight, but everyone coordinated expertly! Our 160 guests LOVED playing with the exhibits throughout the evening, and having the Exploratorium staff on hand to run exhibits made it that much better. We truly couldn't have asked for a more perfect wedding!

A Unique & Modern Indoor/Outdoor Venue

The Fisher Bay Observatory & Terrace at the Exploratorium was the perfect venue for our September wedding. It was perfect for our outdoor ceremony and cocktail hour overlooking the bay during golden hour, followed by our indoor ceremony in a modern space with floor to ceiling glass windows showing the Bay Bridge lit up at night. We were looking for some place unique and fell in love when we saw the kids playing at the exhibits during our first walk through. Our guests had free admission to the Exploratorium prior to the wedding, and we had a fun time taking newlywed photos wherever we wanted after the museum closed. Most importantly, Katie, Billy, and Lauren had such close communication with us, our wedding coordinator, and all the vendors throughout the entire process, everything went so smoothly.

The Event Manager and Event Team were so easy to work with throughout the planning process. They responded so quickly and accommodated endless requests. As a planner, I have worked at many venues before, and I've never had a team assist with unloading and loading my car like them. They never complained and were always willing to help. Everything ran so smoothly and was executed so effortless throughout the wedding. It is an amazing option as a venue, and you will not be disappointed with the quality of service provided.

Unique Spot, Fantastic Staff!

The Exploratorium team is so fabulous and friendly, and they do everything they can to be helpful and accommodating.   
  
The venue is unique, memorable, and requires minimal decor/activations because it is, in itself, a fun and beautiful activation! Plus the views are exquisite. Highly recommend to couples looking for something different and interesting!

Beautiful Venue for a Memorable Evening

We held our 40th wedding anniversary celebration in the Fisher Bay Observatory on June 9. it was a sit down dinner for 130 people with a cocktail reception and then dancing on the terrace. The setting was SPECTACULAR!! So many of our guests commented on how beautiful the view was. The staff at the Exploratorium was so helpful and easy to work with. We've hosted a lot of parties over the years, and honestly, this was the best experience we have ever had with a venue. We will for sure have our next anniversary celebration there--the whole evening was beyond amazing!!

Absolutely spectacular!

I had my wedding at the Exploratorium in September of 2018. The night could not have been a more magical evening. The staff were so accommodating, professional, and literally were one step ahead of every process. I did not have to worry about a SINGLE thing. The ability of their team to work together, and execute such a big gathering (with many moving parts, such as: tech, different set-ups for different areas, food, bar, ect) was exceptional. We had some family pieces we wanted to integrate such as wine collection being served. Each table had a selection which was a hit! They even saved some of the bottles for us to use as keepsakes. They also customized special drinks that we wanted and made a cute menu at the bar! The tech ability was amazing- we had a powerpoint going the whole time of me and my husband, we had wonderful lighting for each "vibe" of the event (i.e dinner, dancing, cocktail hour), and not to mention an amazing sounds system! The view is one of a kind. It was a full glass box looking out to the Bay bridge and Bay- it was sparkly and to this day my guests still talk about how spectacular it was. It was my dream wedding, and I couldn't of done it without the amazing staff and event team at the EXPLO. 10/10 HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

Perfect reception at the Exploratorium

My husband and I threw a wedding reception at the Exploratorium. We couldn’t have been more happy with the experience. Our guests still mention how extraordinary it was to be drinking and dancing at the museum, along with so many incredible interactive exhibits. When it came to logistics the Exploratorium team was so helpful and accommodating. We would recommend this as a wedding venue without reservations.

Looking for a wedding venue? Explor(atorium) no further!

Our wedding at the Exploratorium was absolutely perfect! We knew we were looking for a unique wedding venue that let our personalities shine through and we found just that in the Exploratorium’s quirky vibe and spectacular views. After our initial tour, Katie and the rest of the staff really went above and beyond to make sure our event was everything we hoped it would be and more. Everyone on staff was incredibly responsive and communicative throughout our planning process. Katie recommended excellent catering and planning professionals that worked flawlessly with the venue and staff. As our date approached, we were able to tour our rental space with our planning crew multiple times so we knew everything would run smoothly. To top it off, Katie arranged for some of our favorite exhibits from around the Exploratorium to be brought into our reception space. The exhibits were a hit with the guests and got people talking who would otherwise never have struck up a conversation. We have heard from several guests that our wedding is now the gold-standard and that’s because the entire Exploratorium crew worked tirelessly to make our night magical. Thank you so much for an unforgettable wedding!

A One-of-a-kind Masterpiece

My husband and I have had the pleasure of being a part of several events at The Exploratorium. The absolute care and attention to detail is second-to-none. We are actually wedding photographers in real-life, and are fortunate to be a part of some very special gatherings around the Bay Area. The Exploratorium and its staff are something special. Not only is the location unique and one-of-a-kind, it is also located in one of the most convenient parts of San Francisco. The ability to have your guests arrive by Ferry, train, car, bus, or maybe even a rickshaw? It's one of those things that some couples overlook when they decide on a venue. On the Embarcadero you have all of these options at your disposal.  
Another incredible plus is the preferred vendors they have access to. During every event we have attended, the catering has been superb, the decor trendy, yet classic, the florals stunning, and the entertainment top flight.   
We encourage every couple considering a one-of-a-kind wedding to really explore everything these folks have to offer.
