The Chrysler Museum of Art is a wedding ceremony and reception venue in Norfolk, Virginia. This venue radiates timeless appeal, dramatic magnificence, and true elegance. Couples seeking a venue with a historic backdrop, awe-inducing architecture, and a sense of grandeur will be saying “I do” the minute they see all the Chrysler Museum of Art has to offer!

**Facilities and Capacity**

The Chrysler Museum of Art, a renaissance-inspired building that is sure to drop jaws and impassion hearts with its elaborate architecture, accommodates up to 220 seated guests. Couples will never forget saying their vows and enjoying a reception in Huber Court, the impressive atrium that is both the entryway to the museum and the entryway to the rest of your married life. Magnificent features of this atrium include renaissance-inspired archways, dark wood frame work, polished marble floors, a grandiose double staircase, and a high glass-paned ceiling for natural light (enjoy bright sunlight for a daytime wedding, and celebrate an evening reception under the stars). Couples who prefer their sun and starlight outdoors may choose to have an outdoor ceremony in one of two breathtaking gardens. These gardens offer the dramatic backdrop of the museum’s high walls, the shade of lush green trees, open manicured lawns for plein-air appeal and a classic fountain. These gardens make for excellent photo opportunities before, during and after your special day.

**Services Offered**

Chiavari-style chairs, tables, silverware and china are all-inclusive to a five-hour rental package with the Chrysler Museum of Art. Couples getting married in Huber Court are also granted one hour of access to the gallery or garden areas, making for a wedding experience that is culturally enriching and explorative. A wedding suite complete with vanity lighting and perfect for pre-ceremony photography is also available. Other more general services include setup and cleanup, as well as all essential staffing.

**Location**

The Chrysler Museum of Art is located in Historic Ghent, overlooking the Hague Inlet of the Elizabeth River, which offers a timeless and stunning aesthetic - as well as stunning sunset photos. Being a renaissance-inspired building, the Chrysler Museum of Art has all the panache and high drama that lovers of European architecture will adore.

Beyond Wonderful Wedding 

My husband and I got married at the Chrysler Museum of Art this past September and all we can say is WOW! Our experience from the time we decided to book the museum as our wedding venue to the actual wedding day was amazing. Everyone (the staff) we spoke/worked with was great! Our wedding included a lot of details and moving parts, and the museum definitely worked with us and our vendors so that the vision we had for our wedding could come to life and come to life it definitely did. EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFUL! EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT! This includes the food. The museum’s exclusive caterer, Taste Catering & Events was beyond impressive. Their food is super delicious, the people were helpful and a wonder to work with. We can go on and on about our experience, but overall, five stars across the board.

Our date spot turned wedding venue!

My husband and I have been visiting the Chrysler Museum for years. We had one of our first dates there and we’ve had the opportunity to visit with friends and family numerous times. On a given weekend day, if we’re in Norfolk with no set plans, we drop in to see the different permanent and temporary exhibitions. This is our spot; so it was the perfect setting for our marriage celebration. Huber Court is a beautiful ceremony and reception location, and the Ancient Worlds and Porcelain Galleries made for a unique cocktail hour for our guests. We appreciated, too, having wide access to the museum and museum grounds for photographs prior to the ceremony and during the cocktail hour. We were able to take some truly epic photos – just us and with our wedding party, parents, and siblings. We loved it.

Memorable Experience

We had our wedding here a month ago & I will tell you we fell in love with the venue the first day we visited. This venue is beautiful, there are so many beautiful views for you & for your guests. We loved being able to provide our guests with cocktail hour in the art gallery so they could all be able to enjoy some of the artwork as well. Gabrielle & Jennifer were both a pleasure to work with from the very beginning all the way through til the end. Would highly recommend.

A night to remember! 

My wife and I could not have been happier with our choice of venue being the Chrysler Museum of Art! Absolutely gorgeous building inside and out with the added bonus of having stunning artwork throughout! Our guests were blown away by the atmosphere and experience made possible there! Having the entire building to ourselves for our special event was amazing! The museum provided everything we were looking for in a venue and more! From the Bridal Suite, Groomsmen Room, Wedding Hall, and endless areas for photo ops... it was perfect!

Amazing Experience!

Everything turned out perfect, and we can’t say enough good things! We have been recommending the venue to everyone - their organization, friendliness, and communication was wonderful throughout the whole process! The staff was so helpful and friendly the night of, and made it so easy to get where we needed to be. All of our friends and family still continue to rave about how beautiful the Chrysler was! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a venue!

Epic transformation from Museum to Wedding Vibes

If you are looking for the best place to host your wedding in Norfolk, you found it! I am a professional DJ and I work several wedding events here every year along with my colleagues and already have some lined up for next year. Before this year is over, I wanted to take the time and share with all review readers how grateful I am for the opportunity to be able to collaborate with such a great venue and the talented team that makes magic happen every time I am there. They communicate well with vendors, everything is always clean and looks amazing, and the layout options are awesome. I especially love all the uplighting and decor lighting that we do here, the pictures and videos always come out amazing. They surely go above and beyond for their clients to have the best time ever. Go see for yourself, book your event here!
