We loved our reception room. It was beautiful! The room was decorated as we had discussed. Our reception started at 1730 and the sun was quite bright on the stage area. This left some of guests a little blinded with no solutions. The food was delicious! But they were not going to bend on spending money on food and beverage. Overall, it was well worth our money.

I have to say I loved my venue. The staff are very helpful and understanding. I would get quick responses every time I contacted them. Price is pretty fair.  
In general this is a beautiful golf club. I give them 4/5 because I noticed there was a miscommunication among them. I had a tab for alcohol set and I also asked to let me know when the tab was low... well the bartender was not informed and my guests were charged for alcohol for few minutes. I was able to overcome this problem pretty quick. My suggestion would be to go over alll the DETAILS a day prior to your event. They tend to forget details.
