One of the best views in the city and a unique venue. We had our rehearsal dinner here and everyone enjoyed themselves. There is a list of vendors for catering to choose from and they pretty much let you decorate however you want- candles do have to be covered. There is indoor and outdoor space, your guests have access to the grounds, event room, statue, museum. AV equipment includes speaker system, screen and projector. Clarence was a pleasure to work with, inviting and knowledgeable. He was willing to do whatever he could to make things easy and a success.

This was an absolutely gorgeous setting for a spring wedding. Although we did not get to have the wedding outdoors as we had planned, we did use a corner room that was all glass and looked out over Birmingham. We felt like we were outside anyway, yet we stayed high and dry!

The Vulcan Museum is a fascinating place to have a party. Since the guests can view the museum, those who need a break from the music can wander upstairs. I cannot rave enough about the Vulcan representative who was warm, flexible, helpful, and just plain wonderful. I would definitely use Vulcan again.

We held our Christmas Party at Vulcan. The venue was incredible, the staff responsive to my every whim. I would defiantly recommend using this venue. The views are world class in the daytime and once the sun goes down, it takes your breath away. If you have forgotten how beautiful Birmingham is this is the place to help yourself remember

We were very pleased with the venue and reception - the ceremony was held outside so it was very contingent on the weather but we had a remarkable day and the views were outstanding. The price was very reasonable and I feel we got a lot of value for our expense. My daughter wanted a Birmingham wedding and this venue surely provided that and more! My only complaint would be that the staff turned over several times during the year and a half long time that we planned the wedding. That makes it a little disconcerting to make sure that details were followed through. However, our wedding planner didn't even blink and managed to iron out all the details and problems as they happened without incident.

Vulcan was a WONDERFUL venue for our wedding. The staff are incredibly polite, professional, and helpful. The view of the city that you get at Vulcan at night is GORGEOUS. Out of all the vendors we booked, the Vulcan venue was definitely the best bang for our buck. Our guest loved it, and so did we!

We couldnt of picked a more beautiful place for our reception site. We had an evening reception outside below Vulcan. Our guests danced and enjoyed the night looking out at the Downtown Birmingham city scape. Your rental of the venue comes with access for your guests to take their glass of wine and tour the museum as well as taking the elevator to the top of Vulcan and to look over the reception. It was breathe taking and couldn't have been any better!
