We are completely thrilled with our choice of having our daughter’s wedding ceremony and reception at the Jericho; it was the perfect venue!!! They had it all, from phenomenal staff to incredible food (not kidding the food from appetizers to cake was phenomenal!!) to top notch facilities, not to mention the stunning views of the golf course. We could not have asked for better! They truly make you feel like VIPs throughout the weekend and their top notch events team, especially Christine Niessen, banquet manager, helped ensure that everything ran smoothly behind the scenes. We hosted our ceremony outside on their beautiful brand new outdoor space overlooking the golf course and the brilliant fall colors. The cocktail hour was on the fist floor (indoor/outdoor) on the patio followed by the reception which was upstairs in the banquet room with, again, stunning views of a gorgeous sunset. Guests were in awe of the view (we also lucked out with absolutely perfect weather), how fantastic the food was (tons of delicious choices for one flat fee) and how every detail was perfectly executed. We could not recommend Christine enough. She was so easy to communicate with, always had very helpful suggestions, and went above and beyond helping us. As an example of this, our wedding was destination so rather than throw out all the flowers from the reception, I had asked if we could donate the flowers to a local nursing home. Christine volunteered to transport the flowers herself to the nursing home!!! We were thrilled and so appreciative. I would also like to do a quick shout out to Janet who headed the banquet team and was extremely attentive to the bride and groom and all of our guests!! And cheers to Rich the amazing bartender who was our first friendly hello at Jericho and created a wonderful first impression! A wedding ceremony and reception are a once in a lifetime event. Make sure you have the confidence in your venue and its staff like we did and if you are looking in the New Hope, Pa area, look no further! Jericho is your spot!!

We had our wedding at Springfield Country Club in September 2025 and everything was perfect! Our wedding coordinator, Anna Evans, made the entire process so easy and was always available to answer any questions that we had. SCC included everything that we needed which made the planning process a breeze. The Golf View Ballroom was beautiful and had a wonderful view of the golf course with plenty of space for our guests. The entire evening ran so smoothly, and we did not have to worry about a thing. We received so many compliments from our guests about how well the evening flowed and how delicious the food was. They especially loved the ice cream bar! We cannot thank Anna and her team enough for making our wedding day so special and memorable! We would not hesitate to work with Anna in hosting another event at SCC!

My husband and I had multiple guests tell us our wedding was "the best ever." This was in part thanks to Bartram's Garden!! The scenery/natural backdrop throughout the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception are gorgeous. The food (especially passed apps) are delicious. And the service is impeccable. Working with Kelly throughout the planning made what many find stressful to be an easy process -- she is patient, communicative, and helpful! Our day-of-coordinator, Saayid, was perfect. He attended to all our guests' and our needs. Getting married at Bartram's was a total dream!

We were planning on touring a few other venues but we decided to go with our first choice which was Pen Ryn Estates and we owe that all to Denyse. She has been an absolute gem in helping us pick the perfect venue for our big day. From the very first meeting, she made us feel at ease and listened to our wants, ideas and visions. Her expertise and attention to detail truly shone through every step of the way. You can really tell she loves her job just by how excited and happy she gets talking about the different venues and the history of Pen Ryn Estates.

We are so happy we chose to have our wedding at French Creek - it was the perfect day! We have nothing but good things to say. Obviously, the grounds are stunning and make for a fairytale backdrop. Beyond that, we were so impressed with the service. Sara was incredibly responsive, helpful, and fun to work with. She answered every question with kindness no matter how small or silly, and made every request a reality. I loved having her there on my wedding day. Anna, my bridal attendant, was awesome. She was always there when I needed her and I’m so thankful she was there to help me on the wedding day. Krysta ensured things ran smoothly and Robyn made it easy to keep track of payments. The food was delicious - highly recommend the risotto! Something I loved was that right after our ceremony, Anna and Sara brought us a tray of all the appetizers being passed around so we didn’t miss a thing! It started to rain while we were doing our first look/wedding portraits and Sara magically appeared with umbrellas. Overall, the day ran so smoothly and I felt like I didn’t have to think about a thing - I just got to enjoy the day (and no, we did not have a wedding planner - you really don’t need one, French Creek has it covered!). My one suggestion is that if you plan on taking photos on the dock by the lake, ask them to sweep off the deck. It’s worth it! We would highly recommend French Creek to anyone!

We could not have picked a better place to have our wedding! Everything was perfect - the food, the staff, the venue itself... everything was amazing! The event coordinator Brigid Eisele started when we were 2 months away from our wedding date.. and she jumped into our craziness flawlessly. She answered all 1000 of our emails, she paid attention to every single detail we wanted & needed, and she is extremely personable, which made it easy to talk to her about any worries or concerns we had prior to the wedding. We have ZERO complaints about this venue and it's staff!

Honestly, I would give The Bucks Club more than 5 stars if I could! We booked this venue in late 2023, and couldn't be happier! Shane, the Event Sales Manager, was extremely easy to work with and we never waited more than 24 hours for a response to an email, although Shane usually responded within an hour or two! The venue itself is absolutely gorgeous with new hardwood floors, new chairs and tables and new chandeliers as of November 2023 and there are literally hundreds of places to take photos outside. The food is fantastic, and they include a cake for your wedding, with a cake tasting to choose from a ton of various cake, frosting and filling flavors, each one better than the next! My husband and I are big craft beer drinkers, and Shane helped us effortlessly incorporate craft beer into our bar for the cocktail hour and reception. One of the many reasons we chose The Bucks Club was because they offer a huge 'locker room' (don't think typical locker room) for both the bride and groom to get ready in the morning of the wedding, and also because they only host one event there per day; many of the venues we toured could potentially have more than one wedding on the same day, which we did not want. You can also bring in your own florist or use the one they provide, and can really bring any vision you have to life for your wedding with an indoor or outdoor ceremony. We really enjoyed working with Shane and his staff for our wedding, and would highly recommend booking at The Bucks Club!

Terri and her team were wonderful to work with. They helped guide us the entire process, and answered every question I had no matter how small or silly. My only minor gripe was that they do not put out all decor, as they rely on your florist to do so. We did not hire a florist as we did faux florals to save on budget, which caused some worry when it came to who would decorate the space on the day of. Luckily, we had a family member who works in the industry and was able to cover this portion of the day. I would just say to have everything planned out if this is what you plan to do, as you may have to bring in an outside hire or a talented family member/friend. Other than this, they were utterly incredible to work with, and the grounds are beautiful. We had a perfect day and the food is beyond delicious. We had a stations menu and were not given a tasting, but even blind-selecting the menu, the food was incredible and something we were complimented on multiple times by our guests.
