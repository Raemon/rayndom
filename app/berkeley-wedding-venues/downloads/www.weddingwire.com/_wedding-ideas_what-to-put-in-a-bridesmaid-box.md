Figuring out what to put in a bridesmaid box is a pretty big decision—after all, these are gifts for the people that you eventually want standing by your side on the wedding day. Lucky for you, we've got lots of bridesmaid box ideas that'll show them just how much they mean to you. The [bridesmaid proposal box](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/what-is-a-bridesmaid-proposal) is a sweet way to ask your closest friends or family members to be in your wedding, but deciding exactly what to include isn't always an obvious answer. To make it as easy as possible, we've listed all our favorite things to put in a bridesmaid box below (and if you're still stuck, check out the [WeddingWire Shop](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/weddingwire-shop) for even more inspiration).

## What to Put in a Bridesmaid Box

What you put in your bridesmaid proposal box should be true to you, but it should also delight your wedding party. That can mean gifts, pictures of a fun memory, or a card that earns a laugh—whatever feels right to you! There are also lots of different options to suit every budget, so don't feel pressured to break out your rainy day fund just yet. From a logistical side though, you may want to consider how you'll be delivering these boxes, as that might impact what you include as well. If you're going to be meeting your bridesmaids-to-be in person, delicate items like trinket dishes are a safe bet. On the flipside, if you're delivering them by mail you may want to leave out anything fragile. We've got lots of bridesmaid box ideas right here that'll work either way.
