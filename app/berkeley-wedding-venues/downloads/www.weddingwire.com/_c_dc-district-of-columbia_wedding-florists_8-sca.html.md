Designing Flowers was incredible! They listened to our vision and went above and beyond to bring it to life. The arrangements were stunning—everything from the bouquets to the centerpieces was perfect. Their attention to detail and personal touch made the entire process stress-free. Our guests couldn’t stop complimenting the florals. If you want a florist who truly cares and delivers beyond expectations, look no further! Highly recommend!

Sherry was incredible. I cannot express how wonderful, thoughtful and attentive she was to detail. She created the most exquisite bouquet for me when I personally was confused and didn’t know how to convey my vision of it properly. She understood exactly what I wanted. As to dinner setting, she has done such an incredible job that it transformed the space into the most romantic setting possible, elegant and ethereal. I did not know what the place would look like until I walked in and saw the space. Sherry got the exact vision I had in mind and turned it into a reality. She was also very quick with communication and very helpful with advice and suggestions if you asked for it. Highly recommended. I will be back for other events!

Jenny was so easy to work with, requiring minimal time and communication to make our vision come true, and working within our budget. We received so many compliments on our wedding flowers (which were absolutely stunning). I absolutely recommend working with JP!

I was literally awestruck when I saw my ceremony arbor, sweetheart table, and fireplace mantel on my wedding day. Shelley brought my entire floral vision to life in the most beautiful way, it truly took my breath away. Going into wedding planning, I knew nothing about flowers, and Shelley made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. She sent photo examples to help me narrow down what I liked and didn’t like, let me share my Pinterest board, and really took the time to understand my style. The mums and white roses she chose were absolutely stunning and fit the fall season perfectly. On top of being incredibly talented, Shelley was punctual, kind, and always available, whether by email or text, anytime I had a question. Her responsiveness and attention to detail gave me so much peace of mind throughout planning. She also came up with thoughtful ideas to repurpose pieces, like moving the arbor florals to our sweetheart table after the ceremony, and designed the most gorgeous mantel setup. Everyone was raving about the flowers from the moment they arrived. Shelley exceeded every expectation. Her artistry, professionalism, and warmth made the entire experience unforgettable. I couldn’t recommend her more!

We purchased the elopement package, plus a few extra corsages and boutineers, flower petals, and flower girl baskets from Chevy Chase florist. They were responsive, reasonably priced, and beautiful! I would highly recommend them.

Kathleen at Blooming Spaces was amazing to work with. She was so receptive to my vision for my wedding day florals, helped figure out how best to achieve that vision within our budget, and was very responsive throughout the whole wedding planning process. On top of her amazing customer service though - the floral arrangements turned out absolutely stunning. They were exactly what I had envisioned and more. I wanted colorful, joyful, and bright florals - I centered every design decision around my vision for the flowers - and she achieved it. Whenever we show our photos to anyone, one of the first things they say is how beautiful the flowers are. We are so happy we found Blooming Spaces and if you are considering working with Kathleen - 1000% do it.

Stephanie was an absolute magician! She worked so closely with us to bring our vision of a classy, elegant affair to life—truly impressive considering our modest budget. The arrangements she created were beyond stunning and completely exceeded our expectations. I still dream about how gorgeous the flowers were; they truly elevated the entire event.

Rachel did the most beautiful job with my wedding bouquet and with the floral arrangements for my and my husband’s reception! I think Blooms Reston provided exceptional value for the number and quality of the flowers we got. I received so many compliments from our guests on how lovely the flowers were, and I felt absolutely gorgeous walking down the aisle with my bouquet!
