We are so grateful we were able to hire Najla as our wedding coordinator. She was professional and organized and so so helpful. She did a wonderful job keeping us on track with the planning process even when we got overwhelmed by all the choices. We didn't have a strong vision for what the day should look like, but she was able to take the bits and pieces we did have and create a cohesive design for us, and it was so perfect. Her vendor recommendations were on point, she knows the Portland wedding scene well, and she was just a joy to work with. Thank you Najla!

Nicole was amazing! She made everything so easy. I ended up having an unplanned and scary surgery right before my wedding. Without Nicole, I would not have been able to make my wedding work. She coordinated effortlessly with all my other vendors and made our wedding so special. I did not have to worry about anything during my wedding day, thanks to Nicole. Of the vendors I hired for our wedding, Nicole was by far my favorite.

Sweety was the best Day of Coordinator that we could've asked for. Faced with one of the only rainy days in August, she took charge in creating a plan B on the spot (wife and I were reluctant in creating one beforehand) and it turned out perfectly. After setup, we had nothing to worry about because she was on top of it all. Also very involved in making sure our ducks were in a row before the wedding, which was a huge help. She's one of the nicest, calmest, and reassuring professionals - I seriously recommend booking her for your wedding!

Hiring Morgan and her team is the best choice we made for our wedding! She is incredibly fun and personable and made us feel better every time we spoke, texted, or emailed. We never doubted her organization and Annie, one of Morgan’s team, is so helpful for details. Morgan and the MH Events team were our first hire, before picking a date or venue, They helped us to find and hire the best vendor team we could have imagined. When picking a venue, we saw a few locations, but loved the first place we saw with Morgan. It didn’t have any outside space, so she suggested that we use Hoyt Arboretum for the ceremony. Everything was perfect, or if anything went sideways on our wedding day – we didn’t have any idea! They worked tirelessly to give us the wedding of our dreams. Morgan is detail oriented and super fun to be around! We heartily recommend MH Events to other couples!

Angela was an absolute pleasure to work with and truly helped make our wedding day special. From day one she brought calm, clarity, and direction to what can easily be an overwhelming process. She connected us with amazing vendors she’s partnered with many times before, and it showed — everyone was coordinated, professional, and the entire event ran smoothly because of those relationships. Her planning process was organized, transparent, and easy to follow. We loved using the shared Google Sheets, and she met with us both in person and over video to keep every detail on track. She was also incredibly responsive via text whenever questions or concerns came up, which gave us so much peace of mind. On the wedding day, she handled every detail flawlessly. We were able to be fully present and enjoy the day without stress or scrambling because she had everything under control. When my wife broke a nail the night before, Angela even went out to grab supplies to help fix it — a perfect example of how she consistently goes above and beyond. Our vendors enjoyed working with her, and our families kept commenting on how seamless the day felt thanks to her. If you want a planner who’s organized, warm, proactive, and genuinely invested in making your day perfect, Angela is the one. We couldn’t recommend her more.

We used Indigo Bride as our wedding planner company for our wedding in September at Sunriver Resort, specifically we worked with McKenzie. We have only great things to say about her; I would trust her with my life!! From the start she was honest about what things we should prioritize to ensure we had the wedding of our dreams but stayed within budget. Her and her team have worked many weddings at Sunriver/ Bend area, and it showed: she knew everything about the venue, she knew all the vendors that we had picked/ worked with them many times, she had our day of timeline perfected. Through the whole process we felt so comfortable with her and she made wedding planning so fun and seamless. She was very prompt in answering all my emails and following up with our vendors when needed. On the day of the wedding, I did not have to worry about a single thing. Mckenzie and her team kept the day running smoothly and I am so thankful to have had her as our wedding planner. 1000/10 would recommend~

We loved having Krystle help plan our wedding. Even with the partial planning package, we felt so supported throughout the whole process. Our meetings with her were super helpful. She had checklists for everything, and, without them, we would have forgotten so many details. She also offered a ton of free or cheap rentals for e.g. centerpieces, lawn games, box for cards, etc. Plus she was super responsive and clearly very organized. On the day of she was super on top of everything so we never had to worry, even if something came up. We knew she could handle any roadbumps by herself. Finally, Krystle is just a genuinely kind, thoughtful, and hard working person so it was a treat to spend time with her. We can't recommend her enough and our wedding could not have been as amazing as it was without her help. For context, we got married in McMenamins Edgefield, which she was already familiar with. Our final guest count was around 120 people. Also, her vendor recommendations were perfect for us. We went with her recommendations for a photographer and faux and live flower vendors and had great experiences with all of them.

We absolutely ADORED working with Leann. She was everything we could have wanted in a coordinator- calm, professional. knowledgeable, experienced, the list goes on. Our one and only regret in hiring Shine events is that we only hired Leann for the Month of Coordination package and didn't go with the full wedding planning package. Had we known then what we know now- we would have 100% had Leann plan the full wedding. She made us feel completely at ease. We knew without a doubt that she had everything under control. I cannot recommend Leann highly enough!

Will and his team made our wedding absolutely seamless! He thought of every detail, and was extremely thorough on every planning call, meeting, and the day of. We left each conversation feeling more prepared. The team was generous in their time, professionalism, and kindness at the wedding day. One of my favorite parts of the day was the team continually refreshing my drink without even asking! I felt like a true VIP - as if being the bride wasn't enough :) I am so grateful for their dedication to their work and for their special contribution to our day. I wholeheartedly recommend that you hire Will and DMWTB for your wedding!!!
