We can't say enough wonderful things about Michael, Hazel, Allison, and the entire team at Hart Prairie Lodge at Arizona Snowbowl! From start to finish, they went above and beyond to make our wedding day absolutely perfect. This team was incredibly detail-oriented, thoughtful, and always willing to accommodate our custom requests—even at a moment’s notice. When one of our table number settings went missing right before the reception, they recreated it beautifully within 15 minutes—saving the day without skipping a beat. Throughout the entire planning process, they took thorough notes and asked all the right questions to make sure every detail was just right. On the big day, they kept everything running smoothly and on schedule, and they stayed until the very end to make sure everything was perfect. The chef also deserves a huge shoutout—our guests are still raving about the appetizers, and the entire dinner was absolutely delicious. If you're considering Hart Prairie Lodge for your wedding, don't hesitate. Michael, Hazel, Allison, and the whole team are absolute pros who truly care and go above and beyond to deliver a magical and stress-free experience. We are so grateful to them for making our day unforgettable!

The Windmill House is an amazing breathtaking venue. The owner and his team went above and beyond. We had one of our vendors no-show, and the Windmill House staff jumped into action to do everything they could to make things go as smoothly as possible. It was truly amazing! I would still say my wedding was completely perfect! Choosing the venue was the best decision we made because they very much treat you like family!

What a stunning venue! Everyone there is super sweet, and amazing. Super budget friendly, and the perfect place for a crisp fall wedding. The meadow where the ceremony is was perfect. The weather was beautiful, it was right before sunset, and is just the perfect place for an outdoor wedding. We got ready in the cabin, and had tattoos set up in the yurt. We had plenty of indoor room to get ready, and to hide me until the ceremony. My family and friends were all so in love with the venue, and they can't stop talking about it. My wedding was absolutely perfect!

Our wedding weekend at The Cabins On Strawberry Hill was nothing short of incredible. From the moment we arrived for our 4-day stay, everything ran so smoothly that we were able to truly relax and enjoy the best weekend of our lives. The property itself was everything I had dreamed of and was stunning and well maintained. The staff went above and beyond for us throughout the entire weekend. Everyone we interacted with was kind, attentive, and genuinely invested in making the wedding spectacular. It was clear how much pride they take in what they do to ensure the best experience for the bride and groom and their friends and family. Another thing that stood out to us is the venue's preferred vendors. Every recommendation they gave - from the catering team, wedding planner, and photographer - all were exceptional. We did include some extra vendors that expressed to us the ease of working with the venue. All the vendors worked beautifully together, which made coordination stress-free and allowed us to enjoy our day. We are so grateful to The Cabins on Strawberry Hill and their amazing team for creating such a smooth, joyful, and memorable wedding experience. I can truly say I would not change a single thing about my wedding weekend thanks to this amazing venue. Photography: @marquettelaRee

We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our spring wedding than The Everly. From the moment we toured the space, we knew it was something special—modern, inviting, and full of charm. The natural beauty of the surroundings paired with the thoughtful design of the venue made for an unforgettable atmosphere. The team at The Everly was incredible to work with, especially the coordinator Kylie. They were professional, accommodating, and genuinely cared about making our day everything we hoped it would be. Every detail, from the layout to the lighting, felt effortless and elegant. The indoor-outdoor flow was ideal for a spring wedding, giving our guests the chance to enjoy the beautiful weather while staying comfortable. So many of our guests raved about how unique and welcoming the space felt—and we couldn’t agree more. If you're looking for a venue that offers both style and heart, The Everly is it. It was the perfect backdrop to begin our forever.

My husband and I got married on February 14th 2025 at the Willow Creek Inn. Originally we were going to elope at the Prescott courthouse, but the judge didn't have any availability. Nancy and her team were amazing from start to finish, helping us make our micro wedding/elopement perfect. Our package even included cake and a toast! I highly recommend booking this venue. While we had less than 10 guests, there is so much room and opportunity for larger weddings and Willow Creek Inn is perfect for smaller ceremonies. All of the staff members are wonderful. You cannot go wrong so message Nancy today!

For alcohol license, location, garbage fee it was under $30. SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DESERT LOCATION. Tons of space under Ramadas 9 and 10. The only problem was some of our guests had trouble finding our wedding spot (out of towners) Great venue- even if i wasn't working on a budget i would have still picked this place.
