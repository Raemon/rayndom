Absolutely amazing venue!

We hosted our wedding reception at Mountain Terrace and could not have been happier with our experience. The setting alone is absolutely gorgeous, but this venue does not assume its location is enough. Every interaction from the initial intake, the tasting (they have an INCREDIBLY talented onsite chef), the wedding coordination lead-up to the set-up and service for actual event was OUTSTANDING! Our guests were blown away by the venue, the food and the exceptional service. I cannot think of one thing I would do differently - if you are considering Mountain Terrace...BOOK IT NOW!

Best Team, Gorgeous Place, Always a good time!

As a Wedding Videographer referrals are my preferred way to connect with future clients. Whether by photographer, planner or venue - It is the highest compliment! Whenever I see a referral from The Mountain Terrace I am delighted. It is a stunning venue and is the perfect mix of a variety of locations and a compact, accessible and comfortable venue. It is so well designed and offers beautiful views as well as cozy places for guests to enjoy. The locations for filming are gorgeous as well, between the redwood trees, sweeping views, expansive lawn and twinkle lights hanging from the white tent - the backdrops are perfect to capture the many sides of a Wedding Day. I am always impressed by the food and the professionalism of the staff. They care so much for their clients and guests experiences and have high standards that they hold for all the vendors as well as their staff. I always feel a part of a team which helps me serve my clients all the better! I am grateful to have built the relationship that I have with Caren, Anastasia, and Kristy and look forward to seeing more referrals in my inbox and having the opportunity to film at The Mountain Terrace many more times!

One of our favorite Venues to work at! 

I run a DJ entertainment Company, Justintertainment, based here in The Bay Area. We have had the pleasure of partnering with the team at The Mountain Terrace for several Years and are preferred Vendors to provide DJ Entertainment, Lighting, and photobooths at Weddings and events at Mountain Terrace. There are several beautiful Venues in the Bay Area but this one is special! The serene view on teh Ceremony Lawn is absolutely breathtaking! They also recently remodeled teh dinner patio the interior is classwic and classy at teh same time. Its big enough to host a huge reception but cizy enough to not be too spread out . Moreover, I LOVE the events team! They are amazing to work with! Caren, Anastasia, and Kristy are organized attentive and truly passionate about making their client's dreams come true! Everything always goes so smoothly and that is rare in our industry. Its a truly testament to their experience, their preparation and planning, and their standards for the level of service they provide. If you want a venue that combines charm, elegance AND exceptional service...look no further!

One of my favorite venues!

I have officiated dozens of weddings at Mountain Terrace over the past 20 years. Not only is it a spectacular location, but the staff is unfailingly kind, efficient, talented, and professional. I always assure my couples that their wedding will run smoothly because the onsite coordinators will have everything under control. As an officiant, I find it such a relief to know that these professionals will take charge of every aspect of the rehearsal, ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. They are the best!

Amazing venue in a gorgeous setting!

I am a wedding photographer and have been working with the Mountain Terrace for more than 10 years now. They are, and have always been, absolutely wonderful to work with. The entire staff is so attentive and work seamlessly together to make sure all guests have an amazing experience. I have seen them go above and beyond countless times to give their couples the wedding of their dreams. You can’t beat the peaceful and majestic redwood setting either. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a wedding or event venue.

Serene, picturesque, and run by a fantastic team.

As a local California wedding photographer, I’ve had the joy of working at The Mountain Terrace in Woodside many times over the past few years, and it’s truly one of my favorite venues. Nestled among the towering redwoods, this place offers a magical blend of natural beauty and charm that’s perfect for weddings from 20 people to 150. No matter the size, it always feels like an elevated backyard weddings with seamless transitions between spaces with plenty of photo oppurtunities. The outdoor ceremony space, with its meadow and stunning views of the Bay Area, is absolutely breathtaking. And the transition to a yummy dinner on the deck makes for such a cozy evening to top off the celebration. Not to mention, the fire pits + s’mores option at the end of the night is an excellent way to make sure all guests feel comfortable and can enjoy their time - dance party or no!   
  
From a photographer’s perspective, this venue is a dream. The redwoods, open spaces, and panoramic views create endless opportunities for gorgeous photos, no matter the season or time of day. Plus, the staff here are amazing - always professional, friendly, and on top of everything, making every event run smoothly. I highly recommend working with their venue coordinators to keep things running smoothly, and the kitchen staff is beyond. I ALWAYS look forward to dinners at Mountain Terrace as they use fresh and seasonal ingredients and have some of the best dinner options of any of the venues I’ve worked at.   
  
If you’re looking for a wedding venue that’s serene, picturesque, and run by a fantastic team, The Mountain Terrace is a fantastic choice. It’s a place where unforgettable memories are made!

We love Mountain Terrace!

The Mountain Terrace is an absolute gem of a wedding venue! Everyone on the Heart of Gold DJ team jumps at the opportunity to work there, as we love the natural beauty of the patio & meadow, as well as the beautiful and cozy indoor space where we've had many an excellent dance party :) Kristy and the MT team are always SO helpful, going above and beyond to support their vendors & clients, no matter what the situation or weather. They make it a breeze for clients in providing in house catering that is absolutely delicious and we always have a blast working there. I cannot recommend The Mountain Terrace highly enough for any couple looking for a truly special & memorable wedding experience
