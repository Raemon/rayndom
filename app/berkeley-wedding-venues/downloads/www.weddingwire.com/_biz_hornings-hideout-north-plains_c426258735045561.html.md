9/27/25 Wedding at The Stage

We had our wedding on an absolutely stunning early fall day at The Stage and we are so thrilled with Horning’s Hideout!! We got incredibly lucky with this venue. Nancy Horning was prompt, professional, and so helpful. We were able to visit the venue multiple times, which helped us determine our set up and decor. Horning’s is a popular spot and this was helpful for curating the absolute best vendors for our wedding day. It was so important to us to be able to have the freedom to pick our different vendors and Horning’s made this easy. The grounds are kept in impeccable condition, it was easy to guide guests to our specific venue, and the bathrooms were stocked with the necessities all night! Our guests raved about our venue and it’s because Nancy and the rest of the HH staff are clearly dedicated to maintaining their different venue sites so that everyone gets to enjoy the beautiful space. The Stage site itself was spacious but still felt intimate with our 50 person wedding. Really this venue has it all- I wish I could throw my wedding here on repeat because it was such an incredible day.

Our Perfect Venue!

I couldn't say enough good things about HH!! From beginning to end, we found the staff easy to work with and helpful with details and logistics of our Friday wedding. We got married down in the grotto at their Creekside venue and it was perfect! We got so many compliments on what a unique/beautiful venue it was and the cherry on top was being able to camp with our family and friends the night before and of the wedding (since we were on a Friday). It was so beautiful that we didn't even need that many decorations which helped with setup/tear-down as well as keeping cost down. Our wedding party brought tents & campers and we got a glamping tent through City Lights Glamping and it was perfect! Only tough part was a place to get ready but us girls just got a airbnb the night before and that allowed the boys to camp/party and have the venue to chill at and get ready at the day of the wedding. All and all, THE DAY AND VENUE WAS PERFECT and I would HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND HORNING'S HIDEOUT TO ANYONE!!!!

Would 10/10 recommend!

We were very pleased with the experience at Horning's Hideout. From the beginning of the process of looking at venues, we viewed the three venue options they offer and decided to book! Nancy was very responsive throughout the whole process. You get a lot of bang for your buck and the camping option sold it for us! We had such a magical serene day and are so so thankful this is where we got married.

Amazing Venue!

We had an absolutely amazing experience at Horning’s Hideout for our wedding! From the moment we arrived, everything that was agreed upon was perfectly set up for us, making our day stress-free and enjoyable. One of the best parts was the flexibility—the venue allowed us to bring in all our own drinks, food, and decorations, which made our day truly personal and unique. The staff was fantastic, so helpful and attentive throughout the entire day. We couldn’t have asked for a better venue for such a special occasion. Highly recommend!

Perfect day, Perfect July Venue!

This venue exceeded our expectations from the very beginning. Great communication and any help along the way. Treated like family and not just a business transaction. Staff was welcoming and understanding. Wish we could do it all over again. Highly recommend.

The most GORGEOUS setting 

Bob and Nancy were so helpful. The booking process was so easy. We booked Lakeside and my goodness, it could not have been more perfect. I got to have a dream wedding in a whimsical forest and our photos came out more perfect than I could ever imagine. Bob helped during all the site visits, including the rehearsal, with any questions we had. He also came by to help with the trash during our event. So very kind and considerate. Price includes the arbor and 80 people worth of chairs, tables and linens. A bargain for how gorgeous the place is. They also have additional rental options like extra linens, chairs, tables, string light poles and more. Thank you, thank you! Highly recommend!

Dream wedding!

Many complements of the venue and how intimate it all seemed having privacy and the beauty of it in general. Staff was always friendly, inviting and enthusiastic with our plans. Bob worked with us to ensure we had a successful payment plan as well going above and beyond. Many thanks!!!

Beautiful forest venue! Great for a DIY wedding. 

We had our wedding here and loved it! We had the Creekside area, and it was incredibly lush. It's such a gorgeous venue and felt truly magical. Bob is friendly, informative, and straightforward. Very helpful and easy to work with. Overall, would definitely recommend!
