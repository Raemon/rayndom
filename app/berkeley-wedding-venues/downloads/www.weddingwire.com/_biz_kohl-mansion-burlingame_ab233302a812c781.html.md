Beautiful venue

Diane and Terri were very helpful as we prepared for our wedding at Kohl Mansion. They were responsive and professional, and helped recommend fantastic vendors who were already familiar with the venue. Both were a pleasure to work with! Kohl Mansion was the perfect venue for our wedding – all of our guests were impressed by how beautiful it is! We definitely recommend booking Kohl Mansion as a wedding venue.

I've been dreaming about my wedding at kohl mansion for years. After my fiancée proposed, I had less then a year to plan the wedding. The 2 event planners worked with me and I was able to negoiate an early morning wedding all under my budget. The grounds of the mansion are gorgeous and all the preferred vendors are easy to work with. I would recommend this location to everyone!

We absolutely loved our venue! It was so beautiful inside and so were the grounds. The staff were very helpful and responsive leading up to our big day and the wedding day itself. Terri and Diane are very organized and top of every detail. We got so many compliments from our friends and family about the venue!

Kohl Mansion made the perfect backdrop for our August 2013 wedding. The grounds are stunning, and the house creates an old-timey elegance that just added so much character and class to our wedding day. All of our guests were in awe of the beauty of the house, and the mix of colors and elegant backdrops made for stunning wedding photos. We could not be more pleased with our choice of Kohl Mansion as the venue for our big day!

After looking at several different venues (hotel, golf course etc) around the bay area, it was clear to us that the Kohl Mansion was “the one”. We wanted something unique and breath taking and had seen an ad for them in a magazine and were almost too scared to ask how much the rental fee was. I was free on a weekday and decided to go up and visit the mansion with my Mom. It was really important to us that our venue had curb appeal. The Kohl Mansion has just that (and a ton of parking too!). When we pulled up it was about 3pm and (little to my knowledge) there were catholic school girls leaving the mansion! I didn’t know t hat it doubled as a school as well. After seeing the mansions grandness from the curb I was worried again about the cost and almost didn’t go in. My mom convinced me to give it a try.  
Well, we ended up staying there for about two hours without an appointment and Terri and Dianne (the women who handle the event bookings) were fantastic. They handled all of our questions and offered some sage advice about weddings at the mansion. They supplied us with a vendor list (you are required to pick one of their many caterers and DJs provided but other than that any other vendors are up to you) and after doing the math having our wedding was not too far out of our budget when we factored in the “no corkage/cake cutting” fees and the fact that we could supply our own alcohol. One of the best parts was there were few restrictions. I felt like a lot of other venues had so many restrictions (i/e Palo Alto Hills Golf and Country Clubs no denim/no cell phone use/mandatory valet etc), but the Kohl Mansion was quite easy. There were pretty flexible time slots, although the music must stop at 11pm, and you must use a caterer/dj from their list and other than that the place was all your for the night (no double bookings etc.). As a side note, Woody Miraglia from Big Fun Dj’s was THE BEST, he was the most professional, accommodating and patient DJs I’ve worked with, he was instrumental in the success of our wedding!  
From start to finish we loved EVERYTHING the Kohl Mansion had to offer, our wedding was flawless and the women that the mansion provided for assistance were fantastic. We were able to drop off our items early (wine/favors/etc.) and Teri and Dianne were so accommodating. We couldn’t have asked for anything more and were so pleased with our wedding. We love the Kohl Mansion and wish we could endorse them in any way possible!

We got married at Kohl Mansion on 7/2/16 and since the very first visit, we love the space and knew we wanted our reception there. Dianne and Terri were both so great to work with and were super responsive via email. I was planning my wedding from New York City and they were so flexible and accommodating to my schedule when I was in town and wanted to visit the site. They were very sweet and I loved every minute working with them. They provided me with my day of coordinator who has now become a life long friend and also suggested Mills Wine Group. Without their guidance and help, it wouldn't have gone as smoothly as it did. We had 165 guests and we got to sit outside during the reception and dance inside in the Grand Hall. We received so many compliments on how beautiful the venue was and how well kept the grounds and various rooms were. Thank you for making our wedding day so beautiful and memorable!!

Total dream venue

We got married on September 23, 2023. Honestly, I couldn't have asked for a better venue. It was sophisticated and elegant, but also convenient given you can do everything on site.   
  
One thing to know about Kohl is that it's just the venue; nothing else is included. Which we took as a win, as we wanted to choose our own vendors, and also bring our own alcohol (which Kohl lets you do at no charge). We found our photography & catering vendors through their recommended list.   
  
Denise as our main POC was a gem, absolutely phenomenal in person though occasionally a little delayed over email. I really felt like she cared about making our day special, and she was very quick to share photos of other events to give us ideas, or help us brainstorm how to use a room. She didn't end up being our POC day-of, but Carol was wonderful too.   
  
As for the guests' experience, it was so good. There's plenty of parking on site, and we had a Welcome sign that easily directed them to the patio for refreshments before the ceremony. Honestly the only snag was that the grass was a bit soft and squishy so it wasn't the easiest to walk in. But then moving to the patio for cocktail hour was so seamless. And then when everyone went into the main hall for the reception, it was just beautiful. We ended up having dinner & dancing in the main hall, dessert in the black & white room, a lounge area in the white / green room, a game room in the library, and used the hallway near the staircase for a video booth. Guests being able to use so much of the space throughout the night, including the outside patio too, was so nice.   
  
The other thing I'll mention is the rooms upstairs — they have a beautiful groom's room and bride's room. You can't be there all day, just as soon as your time window starts, which for us was at 2:30pm. But then we also were able to turn the groom's room into a nursing / babysitting room for folks with little ones.   
  
All in all, I'm so thrilled we had our wedding at Kohl — it was a dream!

The kohl mansion was a beautiful venue for my ceremony and reception. The staff was very helpful and the background for pictures are perfect. The only downside is that it only held around 190 guests in the main room, so we couldn't invite everyone we wanted to.

I have had the pleasure of working at this venue twice now, and both times were so enjoyable! Early access on the day-of to set up is always helpful and their on-site staff is so nice and helpful! I have worked mostly with Terri, but everyone there is great! The property is well maintained and the grounds are always so pristine, wedding ready! I'm looking forward to returning to Kohl Mansion to serve more clients in the future =)
