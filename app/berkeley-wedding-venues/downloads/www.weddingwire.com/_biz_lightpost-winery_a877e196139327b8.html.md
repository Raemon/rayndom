Wedding Event

Daryl & I celebrated our wedding at light post, Sofia and her staff were more than helpful and made our experience memorable. Our guests were impressed on how everything was organized and coordinated. When I arrived there was a wonderful room for me to change into my wedding dress, it was decorated with a beautiful bouquet of roses, glass of wine and appetizers I felt very special. All in all, the day couldn't have gone better. We highly recommend them! We really appreciated the great service and great attitude at the Light Post!
