Beautiful Venue for a Wedding

I photographed a wedding here in February of 2022. It is a gorgeous venue. The catering was delicious, the scenery was gorgeous and the hall was so perfect, with glass windows overlooking the golfcourse. It is a nice light venue, not dark and gloomy.

What an Amazing Venue!! We could not have been happier on how our wedding turned out. From the start, communication with the event director(s) were timely. There was a change in the event director in the beginning, which caused some anxiety, but it went smoothly and without incident. The grounds were pristine and I liked how the clubhouse was set apart from the main golf course. I worked predominantly with Tricia, who was fabulous and super helpful throughout the whole process. The day of the wedding, everything went smoothly and the food had rave reviews by my guests. Stephen, the banquet manager, was also excellent during the planning process. The day of the wedding he went truly above and beyond with whatever we needed. Words cannot express how truly grateful we were for making our special day so memorable and perfect.

Peacock Gap Clubhouse is such a beautiful venue! Every guest came up to us either on the wedding day or afterwards to tell us they were blown away by how gorgeous the venue was for both the indoor reception and outdoor ceremony. The beautiful mountain scenery, the tall windows of the reception, the great amenities and rooms to get ready, everything! Everyone also loved the food from their inhouse catering team. We had such wonderful service! Their team really took care of us the day of and the food was amazing! Throughout the planning, their team answered all of our questions and made all the changes we requested and then changed our minds on and re-requested, lol. They were fantastic. I couldn't be happier! (Photos by the amazing Cassie Valente Photography)

Peacock Gap is a fantastic venue in Marin County. I love working there as a photographer because a) its really picturesque with sunsets over the golf course, b) the inside spaces are modern and very roomy so they can be beautifully lit and decorated, and c) the staff is awesome - they take great care of the clients as well as the vendors. I highly recommend Peacock Gap for weddings and corporate events :)
