I initially wrote a review that was a one star rating and decided to give Tai Flora a second chance. From the moment Marisa contacted me until the day after our wedding she was exceptional. I don’t have the words to describe how truly grateful we are for our planner/coordinator Marisa. Everything does happen for a reason. I honestly think she was the person that we needed for our wedding. She listened to every single detail and was as meticulous as we were ensuring that everything was done well. We had a few obstacles especially within the last month and it became unbelievably stressful especially not being on the ground and this woman was patient with us. This is truly what makes a company stand out from the rest. Marisa was able to accommodate us and we are truly indebted to her for this. Marisa, if you read these reviews, we are definitely handing you your flowers today as you deserve them. We hope this company sees your talent and realizes who they truly have in you. You are a professional, detailed, and most of all talented. I thought I had the planning all figured out but you opened my eyes and my goodness! You made our day just remarkable. Not one guest had a bad comment or unpleasant feedback. They were all blown away with every detail in our decor, the tent lighting details, the florals, everything period! It’s almost as if you were in my brain picking out exactly how I envisioned everything. You are a true gem! Keep doing what you’re doing! You are awesome at what you do, we really hope Tai Flora recognizes your talent and knows they have a trendsetter on hand! Thanks for making our experience worth the second chance. We appreciate you Marisa! Sincerely Reenie A Happy Bride

There are no true words to express how good of a planner the Gorgeous flowers team from Draxhall was . To say exceeded our expectations is an understatement. This team did so much for us even taking the time to wait longer than expected on last minute payments, went above and beyond before and during the day of execution. We are lost for words with how amazingly they were , took our vision board and execute our theme flawlessly IN A STORM . We got married a day before Hurricane Melissa and while most planners would have encouraged us to postpone , the team said the show must go on . It truly was the most beautiful day of our lives and we cannot stop saying thank you . I will always recommend this team to ANYONE getting married because they are unmatched. They go beyond the depths of a vendor and acted as our support system during one of the most important moments of our lives. . Thank you again Gorgeous Flowers you are the BEST !

I whole heatedly recommend them to anyone planning a wedding in Ochi. Where do I start? First off I NEED to thank Nikki for all the footwork. She is the best. I arrived a few days before the wedding to finalize things and the fans and bouquets were already in the works.. Miss Jan was with another couple but she tool time out to say hello. Then the day of my wedding well "Mother Nature" decided to rain all over my parade. The bouquets came just as my mum and I were getting into the car to go to the church. They drove through the pouring rain just to get me my bouquet! I was amazed as the flowers were so beautiful. The church was just as I wanted it. Simple and tasteful. Many thanks and blessings!

Marcinne is absolutely wonderful to work with. We engaged 4 florists from the area yet both my husband and I agree that she stood out a mile apart from the others. We both loved her energy from the beginning. We were new to the whole process and spent many days listening to other florists tell us what our tables should like. Marcine from the HOF Decor team talked to us to help us figure out what we liked. She had so many original ideas that she came up with to fit our plan. The centerpieces were gorgeous and all our guests enjoyed taking them home. She felt like family through the process and we absolutely recommend her. She even gave us great advice on how to work on our seating chart. Marcinne is truly a life saver and a visionary in what she does.

Pleasantly surprised by our end result for our wedding and reception! It was a scary experience to plan our wedding in Jamaica from Chicago. However, we were able to see many pictures from Blooms and Branches media and we spoke with Olive to finalize our ideas. When we finally saw our flowers being brought off the van for the reception and the ceremony arch flowers I wanted to cry because they were more beautiful than I could have imagined. Then we saw the fabulous tablecloth decor, candles, and centerpieces we were blown away and so were our guests. We would recommend Blooms and Branches to anyone who wants a fabulous event!
