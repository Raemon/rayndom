##  Find the Best Wedding DJ 

The right DJ is a major piece of your wedding day. Your wedding is more than just one big celebration, it is a sequence of special events, each deserving of it's own special place in time. It is the responsibility of wedding DJs to ensure that your event moves smoothly and fluidly from one perfect moment to the next. Wedding DJs are in charge of creating the right ambience for each moment. And WeddingWire has tons of options to find the best one to suit your needs. The right music is an absolute must. Imagine the greatest romantic comedy you've ever seen. Now imagine it has the soundtrack of an action movie starring Bruce Willis. Nothing would make sense. Bad music choices can take away from the beauty of your special day. 

##  Things to Consider When Selecting Your Wedding DJ 

Here are some things to consider when picking a wedding DJ. 

Your wedding venue may give you a list of wedding DJs, but that doesn't mean you need to choose one on that list. It is important to check that there is nothing in your contract that doesn't allow you to have an outside DJ. Make sure there are no noise limitations, need for extra power supplies, or other equipment a DJ may need. If there are, plan accordingly and tell the DJ ahead of time to see if they can work within those parameters. If they aren't flexible, it may be worth going back to the drawing board. 

Wedding DJs tend to be less expensive than live bands. This means some of the money you allocated for music can be used in another area. DJs also tend to have more musical options and take up less space. Ask your potential DJ selections if they are performing at any public events in the near future. This gives you a chance to see them in person and decide if they fit your style. You also have the chance to see how they interact with the crowd and the venue staff. 

Don't forget to check WeddingWire for reviews from real couples that have worked with those DJs before. Advice from couples in the same boat as you are an absolute must when making those final decisions for your big day. 

After searching around, reading reviews, and possibly seeing potential wedding DJs perform, you'll make your selection. You should give the DJ two specific lists. One should be songs and musical genres you _absolutely_ want to hear and when you want to hear them during the day (i.e. processional, recessional, first dance, mother-son/ father-daughter dance). The other should be other should be songs and musical categories you absolutely do not want to hear. 

##  Accommodate Guests with Reception Music Selection 

The last consideration should be the guest in attendance. It's your big day, but you also want your guests to have a good time. If you have older guests, have some classic songs from the 60s & 70s on your list. Make sure the DJ has a combination of both fast and slow songs to encourage all your guests to get down!
