  * ## Get started

One of the first steps in the wedding planning process is building a free Wedding Website on WeddingWire. We make it easy to include all your wedding information, and our designs are also customizable.

  * ## Design your website

You can build a Wedding Website that reflects your personality. Choose options based on color palette, style and invitation design, and create a custom backdrop with an engagement photo, personal artwork and more. These personal touches will bring your Wedding Website to life.

  * ## Lets us handle RSVPs

One of the best features of our free Wedding Website is that guests can RSVP directly on your website. No need to send out mail in cards or record your RSVPs by hand-we'll keep track of who will be at the big event.

  * ## Create your own URL

What is in a name? Everything! We want your Wedding Website URL to be personal-match it your wedding hashtag or just stick to your first names. Either way, you get to decide.
