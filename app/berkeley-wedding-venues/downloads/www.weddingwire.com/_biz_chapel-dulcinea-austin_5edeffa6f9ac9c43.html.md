__Just me

Chapel Dulcinea, a wedding venue situated in Austin, Texas, is proud to offer all couples a free chapel where they can gather with their loved ones to exchange their vows. This open-air chapel has a great deal of experience hosting weddings. In fact, it commonly hosts over 1,000 weddings in a single year. This site also offers you and your guests the convenience of being close to the downtown area of Austin, giving your wedding party plenty of options for pre- and post-ceremony fun and entertainment.

**Facilities and Capacity**

Perched on a hill near an ancient walking trail, this venue provides you and your guests wide open views of the surrounding areas. This tile-roofed and rustically arched space can accommodate up to 60 of your friends and family. When you say your vows here, you are able to use not only the main Chapel Dulcinea but also the Spence Diamond Pavilion and the Bride's and Groom's Rooms. The separate wedding party rooms allow you to prepare with plenty of privacy. While the chapel is mainly used as a ceremony site, the team can recommend three nearby reception sites -- the Veranda Room, Tuscan Hall, and Wildflower Barn -- for couples to choose from.

**What you'll love about Chapel Dulcinea**

Priceless Venue

We were lucky enough to come across and reserve Chapel Dulcinea for our February 2020 wedding. Their website has every single piece of information needed to plan your wedding with no surprises (You need to spend the time to read!!). The reservation process was seamless and any questions I emailed or called the staff with were promptly answered. They also have a robust list of service providers which comes in extremely handy when you are not from the area as we were. We chose Peary Photography & ATX Elopements for our special day and all expectations were exceeded. Our wedding was perfect for us and it all started with choosing Chapel Dulcinea as our venue.

Michael and Abi’s wedding 

This was the greatest find for a wedding destination, so beautiful, intimate and gorgeous view to have your day. I have highly recommended this place to newly engaged couples and any couple wanting to renew vows.

Great wedding venue!

My wife and I reserved this venue sight-unseen and were blown away by how beautiful it was on our wedding day. The nature surrounding the chapel was breath-taking and the chapel itself was timeless and clean, which is impressive given that it is an open-air structure. The staff were professional and kind, and everything was set up before we arrived- we rented chairs and a table for the reception. The cherry on top was the free live stream for all the family who couldn't make it! We highly recommend Chapel Dulcinea and are so glad we chose this venue.

The most beautiful venue in Texas

We were married at Chapel Dulcinea on January 11, 2020. Tomorrow will be our 5 year anniversary. I have the most wonderful memories because of this spectacular venue. Chapel Dulcinea was special in every possibly way! Words cannot express my gratitude for this place!

Perfect for a small ceremony!

Got married here a month ago and it was the best experience! The staff was great and made the whole process super easy. We hired Kim as our officiant and had Arnold the yellow case guitarist play live music. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a small ceremony.

Beautiful Chapel Dulcinea 

We got married at Chapel Dulcinea with the support and guidance of the company, Elope in Austin. I rented chairs for quests outside of the chapel to accommodate 37 people. The chapel is beautiful, and quiet, and has quaint guest rooms for the bride and groom. I found this chapel online (I am from across the country) and it was more beautiful in real life than the pictures!

Amazing and Beautiful 

This is a DYI Chapel but you can hire affordable vendors to help. They offer all the recommendations you need. I just wish we had a little more time in the bridal suit to prepare but their business model makes sense. We loved absolutely everything about our wedding day!

Chapel Dulcinea is a gorgeous Chapel nestled in the Hill Country. I have married hundreds of couples at this location and each couple has commented on how it's more beautiful in person than it is on their website. The staff is professional, helpful and courteous and you can't find a better bang for your buck than Chapel Dulcinea!
