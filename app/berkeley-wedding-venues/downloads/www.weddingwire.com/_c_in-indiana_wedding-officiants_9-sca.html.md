We found Pastor Matt through the Knot and spoke with him over the phone. He answered all our questions regarding pricing and ceremony logistics, and we felt confident moving forward with him as our wedding officiant. It was a great decision, as he was great throughout the process. His pricing was also competitive with every other option we researched and was very reasonable. We did premarital counseling with him and he provided us four sessions that were very rewarding. He put us both at ease immediately and gave us the confidence to open up to him so he could get to know both of us and our relationship. He was very flexible in terms of available timing and location for these sessions. When it then came time for ceremony planning, he provided us numerous options to customize our ceremony. Pastor Matt was professional, friendly, and caring throughout the process. He was one of our most reliable contacts throughout the wedding planning process and did a wonderful job conducting our ceremony. My wife and I both completely endorse Pastor Matt and recommend him to anyone wanting a pastor to officiate their weddings.

We were so happy that Emily was able to officiate at our wedding. She took the time to get to know us and stayed in contact with us throughout the process of crafting a beautiful, personalized script. This was a second marriage for both of us, and she was sensitive to our concerns about what would or would not be appropriate to say in front of our children. In lieu of a unity candle, we did a unity glass ceremony, which was something new to her as well as to us, but she came up with a perfect introduction to that part of the ceremony. She also provided us with an extensive list of readings to choose from, and that enabled us to make the ceremony even more special and personal. Since it was a fairly small wedding, we did not have a rehearsal, but everything went perfectly smoothly. Even though we chose the bespoke ceremony, which is the most expensive option, we felt that the price was extremely reasonable. In fact, it was one of the lowest priced services of the whole day, which is surprising since an officiant is the one thing absolutely necessary for a wedding! We are grateful to Emily for making it easy and giving us a ceremony that we will always remember fondly.

Veronica officiated our wedding during the total solar eclipse and was wonderful to work with throughout the entire process! From the very beginning, she was very personable and informative and helped us plan each step of our ceremony together. We wanted our wedding to include a handfasting which she was more than happy to accommodate and wrote us a personal script which we could change in any way we wanted. We even had a last-minute addition we wanted to make and weren't able to let her know until the day before the wedding, but she took it in stride and incorporated it into our plans seamlessly. On the actual day of our wedding, she arrived exactly when she said she would and did an incredible job with the entire ceremony. Veronica is extremely knowledgeable and experienced at what she does, knows how to personalize to her client's wishes, when to move out of the way for photos, and is a great public speaker. She was also very charming and charismatic with all of our guests and seemed genuinely thrilled to be there for us! Thank you so much!

Mark has always been close to my family and I knew he would be the perfect person to do the wedding. His stories and enthusiasm were wonderful. Many people were asking where his church was after the wedding. :)
