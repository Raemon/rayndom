Magical wedding venue!

Our wedding at Nella Terra Cellars was a dream come true. From the moment we toured the property, we knew it was the one. The venue is absolutely stunning — with vineyards cascading down the hills, a breathtaking outdoor ceremony space, and a grand staircase that makes for the most incredible bridal entrance. During sunset, we took photos overlooking the rolling hills, and it felt like we were in another world — even though it’s only about 30 minutes from home!  
  
We first met Whitney during our tour, and she instantly made us feel welcomed and taken care of. She was punctual, kind, and so helpful throughout the entire planning process. Whitney stayed on top of everything — from reminder emails to quick responses — and truly made wedding planning feel smooth and stress-free.  
  
Booking Nella Terra also meant working with Simply Lovely Events and On The Vine Catering, which was an amazing bonus. Lindsay from Simply Lovely was phenomenal — she helped us through every detail and made our day so special. The catering team was just as great. Their tasting was delicious, and the food on our wedding day exceeded expectations.  
  
The bridal cottage and groom’s area were great for pre-wedding moments and photos. While you can’t get fully ready in the bridal cottage, it was the perfect spot for final touches before the ceremony.  
  
Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how beautiful the venue was! The drive in is a bit winding, so we arranged for bus transportation — which worked out perfectly. There’s also plenty of parking for those who drive themselves.  
  
I can’t recommend Nella Terra Cellars enough. They know what they’re doing and do it exceptionally well. Every single detail came together seamlessly, and we’ll look back on our wedding day forever with full hearts and huge smiles.

Venue is a must! 

My husband and I visited 4 venues before visiting Nella Terra. After our visit, we knew Nella Terra was the wedding venue for us. It checked off all of our boxes. A tent wedding with lots of greenery and photo opportunities.  
  
We had our wedding October 5,2024 and it was beautiful. We received so many compliments of Nella Terra being the best wedding venue our guests have ever been to. Whitney, her team, and our vendors were amazing.  
  
If you're considering to plan an event at Nella Terra, don't hesitate. You won't regret it! Reach out to Whitney, she will take great care of you and your guests!

Nella Terra is 10/10! 

Nella Terra is as beautiful as it looks! My husband and I got married here in September and both the venue itself and Nella Terra's team are exceptional. We allowed ourselves two years to plan, but having Nella Terra's preferred list of vendors made it so much easier. Kendall at Nella Terra was always available and ensured our special day went off without a hitch. Her and our team of vendors are truly superheroes! Nella Terra was the first venue we toured and we knew right away, it was the one. In September, the hills turn this gorgeous golden color and we took photos during sunset. The venue really speaks for itself and Nella Terra's team is incredibly skilled and coordinated. I couldn't imagine our wedding coming together like it did without their support!

Mid Summer Dream 

My husband and I are 2 amateur event planners, working with Nella Terra Cellars, Simply Lovely Events, and On the Vine Catering was the perfect choice for our Ceremony! The venue was absolutely beautiful, and because it was a mid June wedding it was the perfect weather; our guests absolutely loved using the shuttle and they raved about Hors d’ Oeuvres during Cocktail Hour. We had a few hiccups before the Ceremony, but Tannya and Michelle were quick to communicate and help move the program along.

Our Favorite Bay Area Hidden Gem

I had my wedding in October of 2023 and everything went amazing. We loved our wedding and the people we worked with at Nella Terra. Kendall was our point person throughout the whole process and we couldn't have asked for someone better to work with. She was so incredibly patient with this type A bride with a million and ten questions. Nella Terra does whatever they can on their end to make sure that your day is how you imagined it. Their packages are so convenient and customizable. They also have a solid variety of preferred vendors to choose from. Our guests all had an amazing time and loved our venue. Nella Terra was our hidden gem in the Bay Area and we were so excited to share it with all of our loved ones. All of our guests were in awe of our wedding and could not stop talking about how beautiful the venue was. The walk down the stairs is something the guests cannot stop talking about. I highly recommend this venue because every penny spent was worth it.

Perfect place for a romantic wedding

Nella Terra is STUNNING! The moment Daniel and I stepped foot on the venue, we knew our search was over. There is a long and beautiful staircase surrounded by the grapevines, that makes for a statement grand entrance if you have your ceremony at the venue. The garden is so magical, and the beautiful waterfall makes for a great background for pictures/videos as you cross the bridge. The white tent is perfect, especially for a hot summer wedding, as it provides coverage from the sun, yet it allows some fresh air to pass through. We definitely recommend getting the white drapes for the tent, as it adds that extra touch of elegance! Let's not forget about the beautiful sunset that surrounds the property. DO NOT MISS OUT ON SUNSET PHOTOS!! We almost did, but I am telling you it is so beautiful, and so romantic as you step away from the chaos and get to spend some alone time with your forever partner!  
  
We are extremely happy to have had our wedding at this gorgeous venue. The staff and all of the recommended vendors provided by Nella Terra was nothing short of amazing! We cannot stress how beautiful this place is! We highly recommend getting married here!

Dream Venue!

Nella Terra is our dream venue, and it truly feels like a dream that we were able to get married here!! Kendall and the entire family/staff at NT is incredible. They answered all of our questions and made us feel so welcomed every time we came for a visit. We cannot say thank you enough to Kendall and Whitney for all of their help, advice, and wisdom during our wedding planning! Not to mention, their wine is incredible. We look forward to coming back to celebrate anniversaries for years to come!
