Desert Plantation was the dream location for my daughter’s wedding. The owners were a pleasure to work with. Answering any questions promptly. We had the beautiful house for the weekend which the bridal party thoroughly enjoyed. Couldn’t have asked for a better experience. Highly recommend!

I do not have the proper words to explain how incredible this venue and the team is. Five stars is just not enough! As soon as we chose this venue, the team went to work! They made our wedding planning process a breeze. From the decor, to the food, the flowers and the photography… I couldn’t have imagined a more perfect day. Holly, Hillary, Kaleb, Derek and the rest of the Sainte Terre staff went above and beyond to make our day one that we will never forget. I am so thankful that we found this group of people. Hillary… I just dang love ya girl.

If you are looking for a friendly and compassionate staff, a unique setting/experience, and a wedding to remember for EVERYONE, look no further, my dudes. My fiancé and I spent so much time sifting through venues looking for JUST THE RIGHT PLACE. Outdoor ceremony with a gorgeous background, a unique setting with lots of Louisiana flavor. A menu with a mix of everyone’s favorites, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, a venue that truly cared about our wedding day. It was challenging, but we have no regrets about choosing Bayou Barn. It’s been over a month since the ceremony, and people are still calling me daily about it. Everyone who attended (including my husband and me) said they wished it could have lasted longer, as everyone was sad to leave. They also said that they hadn’t been to a wedding like ours ever. Tammy and Tammy are such wonderful people and have something truly special going on in Marerro! What was a bonus for me and my now-husband is being able to support small businesses, as they source their food and flowers (and basically everything) locally. Take a tour, look through their photobooks, and see for yourself: Bayou Barn makes sure that your special day with be the best day ever! 🥰

Where do I even begin? Bella Rouge is one of those rare venues that makes you wonder if you’ve accidentally wandered onto a movie set. The sweeping forest views, the rolling landscape—honestly, I was so inspired the first time I toured the venue! When I stood there imagining our fall wedding, I could practically see the forest glowing in oranges, reds, and evergreen tones, with a sunset so perfect it felt scheduled just for us. Mrs. Karen was incredible, helping us choose dates that matched our vision of a crisp fall ceremony. And with Bella Rouge’s indoor/outdoor setup, I knew that no matter what Louisiana decided to do—rain, shine, 30 degrees, 85 degrees, or all of the above within an hour—we were covered. Chance and Karen worked together to deliver exactly what we needed, and being from Texas, we really appreciated their top-notch vendor recommendations. We also worked with Gracelynn, a member of the Bella Rouge team, for day-of coordination, and she managed everything beautifully, including the little hiccups no one tells you about until you’re actually getting married. During planning, Bridget helped me navigate table and chair layouts with precise scaled renderings (a lifesaver for a visual person like me). When we arrived on Friday, everything was exactly where it needed to be—no surprises, no chaos, just perfection. I truly can’t say enough about the beauty of the venue, the kindness of the staff, and how everything consistently exceeded our expectations. We also booked the Bella Rouge Lodging for our bridal party, and it was cozy, comfortable, and spacious enough that no one had to arm-wrestle for a bed. The well-stocked kitchen was especially helpful—several of our guests have food allergies, and being able to prep meals safely and easily made a huge difference in keeping the weekend smooth and stress-free. Everything came together so wonderfully. We had the wedding day we dreamed of—and then some. We couldn’t be happier with our experience. Thank you! Rachel Dobbs – Dobbs Wedding, 11-15-25

Donna was such a joy to work with. She made everything so easy, and offered so much for the value. And she is so kind! There is a whole closet filled with more than enough decor for the tables and even the outdoor ceremony area that you will have access to! She is very flexible, she allows whatever vendors you want, whatever timeline for everything within the rental time of 12 hours on your wedding day. She is responsive to all questions and gives her opinions and feedback (which were usually always the best) but honors your wishes for everything! The venue itself is gorgeous, original, and has plenty room for a large guest list (up to 200)! The bridal suite is amazing! It’s literally its own house on the property. It became a hang out spot for moms, cousins, and everyone on the day of. The guys have a separate room as well in the venue that is super nice and a great place to store items. Plenty of dance room, the bar area is roomy, and able to do a serve buffet style The ceremony space is so cute, and a perfect backdrop in late afternoon!! Pics afterward were gorgeous with the sunset spilling over the open field!! I couldn’t recommend this place enough. So professional, everything went smoothly due to all details being communicated clearly, and beautiful!

Covey Rise was perfect! The venue and accommodations are gorgeous. We did the rehearsal and wedding there and stayed on property all weekend. We rented the Magnolia Lodge for my family and the Magnolia Cottage for the bride and bridal party, which was perfect for hair and makeup on the wedding day. The Lodge was complimentary for the groom and groomsmen. They had fun hanging out, playing pool and corn hole. Both parties were provided lunch on the wedding day and the guys were treated to a complimentary shoot. All accommodations were perfect and beautifully decorated! They all had so much fun on the wedding day and had absolutely no stress. Just a blast with their friends. When planning I was nervous because it was all planned long distance. I traveled to the venue once and met Casey who then handled everything by phone and email. I could have gone down more, but doing so wasn’t necessary. Casey handled everything! The different packages are very clear and there are no hidden costs. They will accommodate requests and are very transparent about additional costs upfront. You will not have any surprise costs! The staff is amazing from the wait staff, bar staff, set up crew, and most of all their talented chef. The food for both the rehearsal and reception was incredible. The guests raved about the food! As the mother of the groom who planned the wedding, I wanted an elegant wedding but one that was fun. We definitely got that. The bride and groom loved every minute and so did all of the guests. Staying on property made everything so easy and convenient. Not to mention having wonderful lunches everyday! Don’t think another minute. Book this property. You will be amazed!

This venue was absolutely amazing! The Magnolia House is stunning and the courtyard was beautiful. The owners walked us through every detail to make sure our day was perfect. The decorations and flowers were more beautiful than we could’ve imagined. The owners helped us with vendors for the cake, music, and catering. The night was magical and everything went so smoothly and perfectly. Thank you for making our special day so magical!
