MaryHelen was THE day-of coordinator that I needed for my BEST DAY EVER!🤍✨💍 More than that, she was a friend by my side—supporting me through every moment and making sure I felt calm, cared for, and completely present. She followed the timeline flawlessly, adapted seamlessly to the natural flow of the day, and handled every detail with such grace and confidence. I never had to worry about a thing—she had it all handled, which let me actually enjoy my wedding day to the fullest. I’m so incredibly grateful to have had her there.

Lauren was amazing and went above and beyond to help us with planning, answering any questions we had, and making sure everything was on track. We had two wedding ceremonies in one day and Lauren was there working behind the scenes the whole day to make it run smoothly! She was accommodating and helped with extra seating for lunch that we wanted torn down before our reception, she cleaned throughout the day without ever being noticed. Not to mention, she was super nice and attentive to the wedding party to make sure we had everything we needed!

Bonnie made our wedding day truly unforgettable! Thanks to her impeccable planning and coordination, the entire wedding party was able to relax and fully enjoy the day. What truly set Bonnie apart was her ability to take our vision and bring it to life. She took all of my ideas and somehow designed a perfectly cohesive and beautifully wedding that was better than I could have ever imagined

Our experience with Love Bird Events was incredible. We opted for the Month-of-Coordination with the tear down package - both of with were affordable while still providing amazing service! Sarah single handedly kept us on schedule when it came to all things wedding planning. Our monthly meetings included brainstorming and pinpointing our actual wants for our day, outlining tasks to complete within the month to ensure timely arrivals, and finally going through a step by step plan for our day. Sarah’s laid back approached was so appreciated on our wedding day. She penciled in alone time and was flexible with day of events. Sarah was instrumental in the ease and flow of our day. When faced with the need to move our dance floor indoors due to heat, Sarah responded with “Give me 10 minutes.” She was key to keeping us on schedule in the end to ensure we exited the venue on time and tear down was efficiently executed. We highly recommend!!

We were uncertain if we would need a wedding coordinator, but the first meeting with Brianne answered questions we had and made us consider factors that had not crossed our mind. It was evident that her expertise would be a blessing for our planning and day of coordination. I appreciate her guiding us, helping prioritize what is important, and getting to know us as a couple. Our wedding day was truly Stress Free. Even when we realized I forgot my veil at the hotel, Brianne and her assistant were on it! Her timeline skills were impressive. We really did not need to think about anything the day of our wedding other than being present, which is exactly what we wanted. Please hire Brianne for your wedding, it will be the best decision.

We hired Abbey as our day of coordinator for our wedding. Because of her, I was truly able to relax and be present on our wedding day, knowing everything was handled. She took care of so many small details which made the entire day run smoothly. When my brother came in from out of town and the arm of his suit jacket ripped, she stepped in and sewed it without hesitation. When we realized one of the place cards had a typo, she already had her calligraphy pens on hand and fixed it beautifully. Those little moments could have been stressful, but she handled them effortlessly. She was also incredibly hands-on with setup and tear down, making sure everything was exactly where it needed to be and that nothing was overlooked. Her attention to detail, preparedness, and calm presence made all the difference. If you’re on the fence about hiring a day-of coordinator, don’t be. She went above and beyond in ways we never expected and allowed us to fully enjoy our day. We are so grateful for her and couldn’t recommend her more highly.

My husband and I are so thankful for Amanda, Becky, and the whole Mostly Becky team. Having a day of coordinator was truly a life saver. Not only was Amanda great at keeping us on track with the whole planning process, but she always had great suggestions and ideas a long the way. It was such a blessing to not have to worry about anything the day of. Our wedding day was beyond perfect and it went incredibly smooth. I can't thank the Mostly Becky team enough! 10/10 would recommend!
