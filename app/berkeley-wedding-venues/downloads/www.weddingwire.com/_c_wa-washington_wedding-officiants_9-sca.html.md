We started planning our wedding about 2 months before the official date. When I was searching for officiant, I found Nancy's profile and would like to connect. She responded so quickly and we planned a vibe check in 1 week. The vibe check went well - she learnt a little more about how the wedding looks like, and what we needed. She also explained the pricing to us. After that, she shared 2 sample scripts she has done before, which really matches our background. So we decided to move on with her. During her preparation, we talked about the concern that our parents do not speak English. She has experience with it, and confirmed that she can prepare a translated draft to my bridesmaid so she can help further improve it, and act as a translator. Nancy also spent time connecting with my bridesmaid to go through all the process. At the day of wedding, she arrived early, and checked in with my bridesmaid. She was sooo nice to greet to each guest before the ceremony started. We truly loved how she put our stories together, based on the questionnaire she sent to us about 3 weeks ago. The ceremony went on so smoothly! I would highly recommend Nancy as an officiant, especially if you are not native. She will consider those needs at the first place so you don't need to worry about it. Her words are so warm and touching. And last but not least, her service charge is transparent and very reasonable.

Ann was able to pick our brains and take our thoughts and incorporate them into a beautiful, poetic wedding. I'd recommend her for any couple looking to be married from a humble service to a grand ceremony.

Donna was a wonderful officiant! We opted for a hand fasting ceremony combined with a sharing of the rings afterwards. Donna was really helpful sharing ideas for the ceremony script and helping iron out all the details. We opted to skip a rehearsal and Donna did a great job guiding us through the different steps of the ceremony in the moment. We received so many compliments from guests on how much they loved the simple, nature infused ceremony. She showed up early to make sure everything was in place and walked us through the whole paperwork process afterwards. All in all, we were so happy to find her!

When we started planning our wedding, we knew that we wanted the ceremony to be the focal point, intentional, deeply meaningful, and reflective of our values and personalities. Many elements of traditional ceremonies didn’t really resonate with us so we were looking for additional support beyond that of an officiant. We went to Bill for his services both as a consultant in designing an original, bespoke ceremony and as our officiant. Bill has a great process in place that includes a series of regular meetings, thoughtful prompts, and writing exercises. His insights into existing traditions helped distill what was meaningful to us and his recommendations proved invaluable as we searched for texts and rituals to complement our ceremony. We felt like Bill truly understood our vision; he designed a layout in the round that both accommodated our unique processional and allowed us to feel surrounded by our loved ones. We felt supported and encouraged throughout our preparations and had peace of mind that we could fully rely on Bill’s experience and expertise. From the ceremony design to his organization and professionalism as officiant, we appreciated Bill’s amicable approach, his intentionality, and attention to detail. In the end, our ceremony was everything we had hoped for and more thanks to Bill’s expert guidance and consultation. He was a joy to work with and we’re so grateful for his role in our journey into marriage. (Photography credit: @thehannahhix)

Hillary is hands down my favorite officiant to work with in Washington. She’s bubbly, warm, and makes every couple feel at ease, while also being incredibly professional and calm under pressure. She’s super responsive and reliable, which makes the planning process seamless. Her ceremonies are always beautiful, she puts so much care and effort into each script, making them personal and heartfelt. It’s clear how much she loves what she does, and that energy shines through. On top of that, her partner is just as wonderful to work with, making them an unbeatable team. I always look forward to working with her! - Prologue Events

We had the honor of having Reverend Ron officiate our wedding on August 8th, and we could not be more grateful. From the very first meeting, he asked us thoughtful questions and truly listened to what we wanted. We hoped for a religious ceremony, and he understood our vision perfectly without ever trying to sway us in another direction. On the day of our wedding, Ron was the picture of professionalism—arriving on time, calm, and reassuring. His presence made us feel at ease and fully in the moment with each other. He struck the perfect balance between formality and warmth, creating an atmosphere that felt both reverent and inviting. The prayer he shared was absolutely beautiful and meaningful to us. Our guests couldn’t stop raving about how moving and heartfelt the ceremony was, and we wholeheartedly agree. Reverend Ron delivered exactly what we dreamed of and more. If you are looking for an officiant who is confident, respectful, and truly committed to giving you the perfect ceremony, we cannot recommend him enough.
