My husband and I held our wedding reception at the Bridges Golf Club, the Garden Pavilion room, and we were so delighted at how beautiful everything turned out! We worked with Sharon, who was highly responsive, flexible, and answered our many questions. Sharon was honest and provided great recommendations for the food, table layout, timeline, etc. Her feedback and wonderful communication skills made the wedding planning process so smooth. The wedding day was a breeze. The staff at the Bridges were on top of things and were on schedule. The table settings were beautiful, the staff were kind and professional, and the setting was stunning. Our guests were blown away by the spectacular views of the canyon, and took epic sunset photos. The staff always checked in on my husband and I to ensure we had sufficient food and drinks. Speaking of food, the food was so delicious! With Sharon's recommendation, we selected the prime rib, salmon, and ravioli. The portions were generous, and the guests were very impressed by the quality! We also had an open bar, and everyone enjoyed the quality of the drinks. We would recommend the Bridges without hesitation! Thanks Bridges for making our wedding day so magical.

I want to go back and do it all again. From the planning to the wedding day, everything was perfect. We chose the venue because it was so beautiful, but the team we worked with made the choice the best. Wedgewood Weddings does it all!! We worked with all of their recommended vendors, and they exceeded our expectations. The DJ knows how to get the party started. Our bartender kept the drinks flowing. And our captain kept everything running smoothly. I didn't have to worry about a thing. I am so happy we chose San Ramon Waters, I would make the decision again if I could.
