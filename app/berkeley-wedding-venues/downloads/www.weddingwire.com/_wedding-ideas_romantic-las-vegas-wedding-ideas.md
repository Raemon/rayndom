With its world-class hotels, premier dining options, breathtaking venues, and one-of-a-kind attractions, [Las Vegas](https://www.visitlasvegas.com/trip-planning/weddings/) is an all-encompassing destination for couples who want everything on their wedding day: romance, luxury and adventure. Whether you’re inviting dozens of your friends to join you on your big day, or are looking for something more low-key and intimate, there are romantic Las Vegas wedding ideas for every type of couple. And while you’re in town for your wedding, we recommend making the most of your newlywed bliss by checking out the most romantic spots and activities along the Strip.

## Here are our favorite ideas for a romantic Las Vegas wedding.

### Say “I Do” in a Gorgeous Garden

Nestled among the skyscrapers, hotels and bustling shopping centers along the Strip, you’ll find the [Venus Garden at Caesars Palace](https://www.caesars.com/las-vegas/weddings). This peaceful garden, appropriately named after the Roman goddess of love, is an ideal ceremony location if you’ve been dreaming of a romantic outdoor Las Vegas wedding. The Venus Garden is surrounded by tall palm trees and landscaped flowers, guaranteeing maximum privacy and a beautiful backdrop for your wedding day. Roman-inspired architecture, including an arched temple at the altar, brings elegant European flair to the garden. The Venus Garden is spacious enough for 114 guests and also features a fountain and koi pond.

### Line Your Aisle With Candles

There’s nothing more romantic than exchanging your vows while surrounded by dozens of twinkling candles. The outdoor courtyard at [Emerald at Queensridge](https://www.emeraldatqueensridge.com/) was practically made for decorating with candles, and lots of them — we’re obsessed with how dreamy this ceremony space looks. The draped fabric canopies only add to the fairytale atmosphere of this classic Las Vegas wedding venue. Emerald at Queensridge, which is a quick 20-minute drive from the Strip, also has a grand ballroom that can be used as a reception area or indoor ceremony space.

### Unwind at a Luxurious Spa

Your wedding day is all about looking and feeling your best. Treat yourselves to couple’s appointment at one of Las Vegas’ extraordinary spas — before you know it, you’ll feel completely rejuvenated and ready to walk down the aisle. [The Spa at Green Valley Ranch](https://www.gvrspa.com/) is our top choice for your pre-wedding pampering. Book a couples’ massage in the luxury suite, which features a private soaking tub followed by a relaxing 50-minute massage. This award-winning spa also offers a range of other services, including facials, waxing, nails and more.

### Rent a Gondola for Two

Glide down the Grand Canal of Venice in your very own gondola — without ever having to leave Las Vegas. Choose from an indoor or outdoor gondola ride at [The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino](https://www.venetian.com/) and relax as you sip champagne while leisurely taking in the unique views of the city, all while being serenaded by your gondolier. Looking to elope? Say “I Do” aboard one of the Venetian’s romantic white wedding gondolas. While you’re at the Grand Canal Shoppes, stop by the Wedding Bridge and the Palazzo Waterfall for excellent wedding photo ops.

### Stay in a Swanky Suite

If there was ever a time to indulge, your wedding day is it! Celebrate your newlywed status and kickstart your honeymoon by staying at one of Las Vegas’ most exclusive hotels. From posh rooms at the [Waldorf Astoria](https://www.waldorfastorialasvegas.com/?WT.mc_id=zMMEC0US1WA2DMH3Display4testcampaign_Mar56LASWDWA7EN8i80428) to tropical one bedroom villas (complete with your own private pool and butler) at The Mirage, Las Vegas is the ultimate spot for couples who want to feel like royalty.

### Go to Paris for the Day

If you’ve ever dreamed of getting married in the City of Love, you’re in luck. The Strip’s replica of the famous Eiffel Tower is one of the most romantic spots in Las Vegas, and it makes a perfect stop on your wedding itinerary. At [Paris Las Vegas](https://www.caesars.com/paris-las-vegas/things-to-do/weddings#.WqvYO5PwZTa), an elevator takes you up 460 feet to an observation deck, where you’ll have 360-degree views of the Strip and beyond. The Eiffel Tower Restaurant, located one story below the observation deck, is one of Las Vegas’ best fine dining spots for a romantic meal. Naturally, the menu consists of authentic French cuisine, such as crepes, filet mignon, souffles, and more — but the view of the Bellagio Fountains is just as memorable as the food. At the base of the Eiffel Tower you’ll find replicas of other Parisian landmarks, including the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre and the Paris Opera House.

### Make Time for Drinks

Las Vegas is home to some of the best restaurants in the world, but the Strip is also a great spot to try fabulous cocktails, fine wines, and a variety of other irresistible libations. If you and your spouse can both appreciate a glass of wine and exemplary service, then you won’t want to miss out on dinner and drinks at Hugo’s Cellar at Four Queens. From the candle-lit atmosphere to personal wine recommendations by the in-house sommelier, this classic Las Vegas restaurant is a must-visit for couples seeking a romantic evening for two. The finishing touch? Ladies receive a long-stem rose from the hostess upon arrival.

For cocktails with a view, head to 107 Sky Lounge at The STRAT Hotel, Casino and SkyPod. Admire the Las Vegas skyline from above while you enjoy bottle service, appetizers, and signature drinks prepared by award-winning bartenders. Modern decor and live entertainment add to this lounge’s sleek, posh vibe. Arrive before sunset for the most spectacular views.

### See a Romantic Show

Las Vegas is second to none when it comes to live performances and captivating shows, and no visit to the Strip would be complete without seeing one of the city’s famous productions. “O” by Cirque du Soleil is a mesmerizing array of acrobatics, synchronized swimming, and surrealism performed in a European-style theater at The Bellagio. At Wynn Las Vegas, Le Rêve — The Dream narrates a dramatic story of love and passion through lighting effects, dance and pyrotechnics.
