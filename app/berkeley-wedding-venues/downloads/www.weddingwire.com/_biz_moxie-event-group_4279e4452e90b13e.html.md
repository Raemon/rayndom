Moxie Event Group, with offices in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia, is a boutique wedding entertainment company specializing in high-energy DJ/MC hosting, modern production, and a personalized planning experience from start to finish. We’re not a high-volume company — we’re a team of passionate entertainers who care deeply about getting to know every couple, understanding their vision, and crafting a celebration that feels authentically “you.”

With years of experience across hundreds of weddings, our team brings a confident, polished, and fun energy to every event. Whether you want a packed dance floor, a smooth and stress-free timeline, or an elevated atmosphere with lighting, special effects, and clean modern setups, we’re here to make it happen. We don’t do cookie-cutter playlists or generic hosting. Everything is customized around your style, your vibe, and the moments that matter most to you.

Our team includes DJs, MCs, Event Coordinators, and Production Specialists who work together to ensure every detail is handled long before the wedding day arrives. From the first consultation to the last song of the night, we focus on communication, professionalism, and creating a seamless experience for you and your vendors. Couples love our ability to connect with guests of all ages, keep the energy right where it needs to be, and read the room in real time — creating a dance floor that feels natural, not forced.

We offer a range of enhancements, including intelligent lighting design, LED screens, cold sparks, CO₂ effects, photo booths, staging, and full room uplighting, all designed to elevate your wedding without ever overwhelming it. Everything is clean, modern, and intentionally curated to match your venue and aesthetic.

At Moxie, your wedding isn’t “another event on the calendar.” It’s a moment in your life that deserves care, intention, and a team that treats it like their own. Our couples consistently describe us as professional, easy to work with, and incredibly fun — the perfect balance of polished hosting and unforgettable party energy.

If you’re looking for entertainment that feels personal, elevated, and full of Moxie… we’d love to connect and help bring your vision to life.

These guys are the best!

We hired Jesse and his team for our wedding in October 2021. He helped us with DJ/MC, photo booth, and uplighting services.   
  
To say he was the best vendor we hired is an understatement. He went absolutely above and beyond to make sure our night was extra special. From the get go, we knew Jesse was our guy because he took the time to schedule multiple calls with us prior to the event to make sure he knew what we wanted. His energy matched ours and he made us feel comfortable every step of the way. He was professional and quick to respond whenever we had any questions.   
  
The day of, he made sure both the ceremony and reception was running the way what we wanted, he read the room and knew when to hype things up or slow things down, and he worked well with the venue and other vendors to make sure everything was aligned on schedule. His expertise and energy is beyond. If you are looking for an all-around professional and organized event team to run your party, these guys are it!

Tyler and Jesse went all out!!!

We were nervous about blending Polish and Spanish music with everything else, but the combination of Tyler and Jesse absolutely handled it flawlessly. Both sides of our family were dancing together, which meant so much to us. The transitions felt natural, and nothing felt thrown in randomly. It truly felt like our cultures came together on the dance floor.

We wanted a club.. AND WE GOT IT!

Tyler somehow made it feel like a club and a wedding at the same time. The transitions were clean, the pacing was perfect, and the vibe matched the room exactly. It felt modern and fun but never out of place. We trusted him completely, and that trust paid off.

Our Guests Wouldn’t Leave the Dance Floor!

People were sweating, laughing, and losing their voices by the end of the night — in the best way. Tyler kept the momentum going without burning everyone out too early. He mixed everything so smoothly that the night just flew by. We still hear about how fun our wedding was.

Exactly the Energy We Wanted

We were really specific about the vibe we wanted — fun, high-energy, but still classy — and Tyler delivered exactly that. We first spoke with Jesse and after hearing what we were looking for, he introduced us to Tyler and we couldn't be more thrilled! Nothing felt forced or awkward, and he didn’t over-talk on the mic. The music choices made sense all night, and the crowd stayed engaged from start to finish.

Dance Floor Was Full the Entire Night

I don’t think I saw the dance floor empty once. Tyler knew exactly when to switch things up and when to let a moment ride. It never felt like a playlist — it felt like he was reading the room the entire time. Multiple people told us it was the most fun wedding they’d been to, which is honestly the best compliment.

Jesse is The Best!

Jesse MC'd our wedding at the Hamilton Manor and we couldn't have asked for a better MC. Jesse was the perfect amount of engaged with our guests and the mix/flow of the music we selected was amazing. He kept everyone dancing all night long! We've had multiple people ask who was our DJ/MC was because they're interested in booking Him for their own weddings. We highly recommend Jesse! Not only is he good at what he does do but he was professional, personable and just made our day easier and more enjoyable. So many of our guests shared that it was an amazing wedding overall, but our entertainment was top notch.  
Overall we are so happy that we booked with Jesse because we couldn't see ourselves with anyone else. He was great from our first meeting all the way through to our special day. Seriously a great team and we can't thank them enough!

Jesse was absolutely amazing and played a huge role in making our wedding perfect. From start to finish, he knew exactly how to make it fun for everyone and keep the energy up all night. He really listened to our requests, but we also trusted him with the music choices and he nailed it!!!   
Jesse gave great suggestions for key moments like our entrance songs, and everything flowed seamlessly. He worked incredibly well with all of our vendors, which made the entire day stress-free and enjoyable. Years later, people still talk about how much fun our wedding was, and that’s largely thanks to him. I can’t recommend Jesse enough!
