During our wedding, countless things came up that needed calm, timely solutions—and Marissa was always right there, handling everything flawlessly. She brought my vision to life, especially when we ran into issues with our seating chart display. Leading up to our wedding, she spent hours helping me sort through my ideas to figure out exactly what we wanted for our day. She directed people effortlessly at our rehearsal dinner and wedding day. She was super organized, and she has such a creative eye. There were so many details I completely forgot about, and she always made sure we considered what to add, what to skip, and what we might need in each space and moment of our schedule so the entire day flowed seamlessly. Beyond her organization and creativity, Marissa has such a calming presence. She made me feel confident and at ease during moments that could have been stressful which was priceless. You’d be crazy not to book Vine & Branch as your event planner!

Hiring Brindle + Oak was the best decision we made to ensure that our daughter's wedding day was perfect. Stefany was absolutely incredible. In addition to being so adorable and sweet, she was meticulous with every detail and made sure that everything was literally perfect. We did all of our own contracts, but then she took over and made sure we had everything queued up perfectly. She took over all communication with our vendors and made it all happen exactly how we wanted. I actually don't know how people have a wedding without a day of planner. It was so amazing to just show up to all of our events and not have to run the show or worry about any detail. I will absolutely be hiring Brindle + Oak for all my daughters' weddings!

Wanda was incredibly helpful in planning our wedding, from finding the perfect venue to ensuring all the little details on our big day were accounted for; she truly surpassed our expectations to make everything perfect. She went above and beyond her contractual obligations, making the stressful planning process seamless and structured. We cannot say enough about her contribution to the most important day of our lives, and it wouldn't have been as special as it was without her efforts. She helped us look for cost savings opportunities and helped us manage all of our vendors so that our wedding day was completely hands-off. We decided to skip the videographer, and Wanda was so sweet and recorded our ceremony and speeches on her phone and sent them to us, ensuring we'd capture every moment of our wedding. Thank you so much Wanda for making our wedding what it was! We're so grateful. Nick & Nicole

Working with Angie and her team was truly one of the best decisions we made for our wedding! From the moment we started planning to the very last dance, she was right by my side — calm, encouraging, and so incredibly helpful every step of the way. On the day of the wedding, Angie handled everything so seamlessly — picking up details I hadn't even thought of, coordinating with vendors, and making sure the entire day ran perfectly. As an event planner myself I kept asking "What about..." and Angie confidently reminded me she had it covered and all was handled - keeping me the Bride at all times. I always felt supported and cheered on, and I never had to worry because I knew she had it under control. Not only is Angie an amazing planner and calming presence, but she also has a fantastic network of vendors, which made the entire process even easier. I am beyond grateful for everything Sapphire Celebrations did to help create the most incredible, stress-free day. Highly, highly recommend!

Stephanie was more than amazing when helping us plan and coordinate our wedding. I had no idea how many little things went into all of it and she made it such a smooth process! She allowed us to use a lot of her signage and decor which is HUGE when we weren’t wanting to purchase a bunch of items that we would only be using for one day. She handled so much of the “behind the scenes” communication which took a lot of stress off my husband and I, and we were able to enjoy the entire day without feeling overwhelmed! I would recommend her to anyone looking for a wedding planner or day of coordinator. We were so lucky to have found her.

I could never say enough praise for Dani, Casey, and then entire Aspen & Ivy team. We booked them for Day of Wedding Coordination less than 45 days out from our Indian-American wedding. In just over a month they entirely understood, bought into and championed my entire wedding vision. They are industry superstars through and through! The specificity of focus was unimaginable. They foresaw and managed every detail of the day with the same care and attention to detail that can usually only be expected of the bride! I felt entirely comfortable enjoying the big day, and the weeks leading up to it, knowing that the Aspen & Ivy team was overseeing the project with a diligence I could never have replicated. They executed every vignette, operation, and experience perfectly - from our non-traditional Mandap & blended Hindu-American ceremony to our dance floor alien invasion & bride-powered DJ set. They ensured our personalities shone through while giving us the space to enjoy all our hard work. As an event and entertainment professional myself, I could not recommend them more - book them now!

Kime is extremely talented! I am a Catering Coordinator from Three Leaf Catering, and had the honor of working with Kime on a wedding in August of 2025. From the initial planning discussions, to the execution on the event day, Kime was amazing to work with. She is an extraordinary wedding planner, with her incredible attention to detail, meticulous communication, and ability to solve problems as they come. Her calm, confident nature allowed the day to run as seamless as possible, even with a downpour of rain that led to last-minute timeline and floorplan changes. Her care for her clients truly shows her sincere passion for the event industry! Kime is extremely professional, passionate about her career, and genuinely invested in making events unforgettable. I have no hesitation in recommending Kime to any couples who are looking for a passionate, down-to-earth planner that is extremely knowledgeable in her field!
