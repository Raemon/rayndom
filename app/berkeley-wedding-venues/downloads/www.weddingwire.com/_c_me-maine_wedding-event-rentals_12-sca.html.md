This company was recommended to us by our venue, the Samoset Resort.

Set up was quick and flawless and the tent was excellent.

Highly recommend using Party Time for backyard events! We used them for our rehearsal dinner, and everything was set up quickly and professionally. They were, in fact, even TOO early to set up before the event, which is a good problem to have! The 30 x 60 tent we rented was perfect, and in fact proved essential and effective during a brief thunderstorm that evening. Party Time was also amazing with adding on last-minute items (glassware, etc.) and we used their items for many of our wedding weekend needs.
