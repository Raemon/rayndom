Lolita Garibaldi coordinated our wedding and her services were amazing- we couldn't have asked for better wedding planning services! Lolita coordinated all of our wedding details over the course of the year during our planning process and walked us through every step of the way. Lolita has a significant amount of experience and knew the questions to ask of us and of our vendors. We were also amazed that Lolita is an excellent wedding decor designer. We showed her pictures of what we wanted and she either already had the items or was able to find or even create them for us at a very reasonable cost. We highly recommend Lolita's wedding planning services. She made sure each moment of our day was perfect and we were extremely satisfied.

Hiring Poshed and Peachy was easily the best money I spent on my wedding. We are not local to Louisiana and wanted a New Orleans wedding and Poshed and Peachy made that happen! Michelle took time to understand (and help curate) our vision early on, made excellent vendor recommendations, and facilitated communication with them all. Her organization was perfect throughout the entire process and helped everything run SO smoothly the day of the wedding. My entire wedding planning process was totally stress-free and Poshed and Peachy kept everything on track. Perfect 10 experience—I can’t recommend Poshed and Peachy enough!

Kristen and her team did an amazing job with planning my destination wedding! I really appreciated the fact that Kristen didn't mind going to the store to purchase a shawl for unexpectedly cold weather on my wedding day. I love her attention to detail! Everyone on her team was extremely professional and kind. I would highly suggest booking Kristen for weddings in New Orleans! 💕

We are so happy we went with Uncommon Camellia for our day-of wedding coordinating needs! Mary Grace was an absolute joy to work with, and so patient with my many late night text messages. The questionnaire was extremely detailed, and I plan to frame the final version of our wedding day timeline. It is truly a work of art! We had a lot of different moving parts, and Mary Grace expertly navigated coordinating all of our vendors to ensure the vision was met. We also opted to have a bridal suite attendant for the wedding day as we were sleeping at our venue that night, and while it was nice to have someone pick up and stage food for the bridal party, I think ultimately we probably would have been okay without that addition as the majority of the "clean up" necessary was personal belongings being strewn about. Which is just hard for someone else to clean! Mary Grace made sure to send me a packing list the morning of the wedding to make sure I didn't forget any small detail items, and her team made sure the day progressed smoothly and we stayed on track. We had many guests comment on how well everything flowed! She made sure she understood what our priorities were for the day, and that we checked all of those boxes and got the photos we wanted. It gave us so much peace of mind knowing she was making sure our personal items (such as photos for a memorial altar) were safe, and even packed them up and delivered them to where we were staying at the end of the night. She was always ready to jump in and help with whatever we needed (even if what I needed was for her to help hold my skirts while I used the bathroom)! She was truly invaluable, and the value of the services provided cannot be overstated. She was also so easy to get along with, she effortlessly walked the line of being extremely professional while also being someone I'd love to be friends with. I knew we were in good hands with Mary Grace, and think the cost was well worth it!

Wow, where do I start?!! My husband and I got married last Saturday and one of the best decisions we made was hiring Southern Belle Events. My best advice to future brides- do not get married without Katie and Karin by your side! They made the whole experience for me, my husband, our wedding party, and families completely stress free. They had everything under control and I was able to relax the entire day and enjoy myself. I had 1 issue with my cake vendor and Katie and Karin took care of it so quickly, I hardly noticed the issue. They made sure all the vendors were there on time and the venue was set up exactly how we wanted it. They also kept us on time (including our groomsmen and my groom- thank you Katie and Karin for keeping up with these party animals and making sure they were on time ;-) At the end of the night when we returned to our hotel room, everything was there waiting for us. It was so nice that we were able to leave the venue, enjoy our second line, then go out after without having to worry about getting back to the venue to pick up all of our belongings. The day was completely magical and perfect thanks to Southern Belle Events! I couldn't recommend them enough! Thank you so much for everything Katie and Karin! <3 the Risks

WOW! There is so much I can say about Allie's professionalism and knowledge! She is highly collaborative and retains so much respect from vendors all over Louisiana. Every time I contacted a vendor and mentioned Allie was my wedding coordinator, there was always a resounding cheer/ sigh of relief because they knew she would get the job done! Allie also did a great job of suggesting things for my wedding without taking it over (which as a type A planner was a big thing for me!). She is also FUN and has the brightest spirit! 10/10 recommend, 5 stars, 100% the best around- if you haven't booked her already you are crazy!

Alicia and the team at Pennywell are true professionals! From planning to execution they have the skills, experience, and network to make your big day a success. We had multiple events throughout the weekend and Alicia was there to make sure everything went off without a hitch. Easy to work with and a bargain compared to others in the city.

Hiring and working with Megan of Down Annie Lane was worth all of the money. Being a long-distance bride can be nerve-wracking, especially when it comes to the small details. Prior to the wedding, we had several coordination calls with Megan going over details of the wedding, such as schedule and decor . Megan's decor rental option was a lifesaver for us. It totally took the pressure off of having to purchase, transport, set up, and takedown. On the wedding day, Megan and her assistant Alecia rocked it! If anything went wrong, I did not know about it. Our wedding was absolutely beautiful thanks to Megan and Alecia. Weddings can be stressful but Megan was able to take so much stress off. I HIGHLY recommend Megan.

Words cannot adequately describe how grateful I am for Kelly. I could not be more serious when I say doing this without her would have taken years off my life. Her incredible efficiency, organization and experience was truly invaluable when we decided to postpone our March 2020 wedding just a few days beforehand. She got all the vendors on board within a couple hours and helped us lock down a new date. Then she stayed with us through another postponement, helping us change events and schedules when things shifted nearly two years later. In a world without COVID this review would go something like 'Kelly was absolutely fabulous to work with. She planned an amazing day and made decisions easy, suggesting the perfect vendors. Communication was smooth and effortless. She was always available and answered every detailed question that popped into my head. She even gave me a video tour of our venue since we were planning remotely. She was fun and straight forward and gave us her honest opinion which was so helpful for someone like me. She managed set up and break down at the venue so none of us had to worry about anything. She's the greatest. Hire her!' But when I think about all she managed to do for us in the chaotic days of early COVID, I'm so grateful she was in my corner. And she was so patient with us in the following years, with the reschedules, so we could recreate the day we had originally planned. It was a magical day and we really owe most of it to Kelly!
