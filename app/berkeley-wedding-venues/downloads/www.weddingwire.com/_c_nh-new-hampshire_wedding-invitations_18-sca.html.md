I bought print-your-own invitation kits from a craft store and tried to do them myself... what a disaster! I took the kits to The Copy Shop and they were able to print them for me, and did a beautiful job. Best of all, it didn't take long AT ALL and they were so inexpensive!!! I will do all of my printing & copying with them from now on!

Jean was a delight to work with! She was very receptive to what we discussed, especially because I didn't really know we wanted for our invite design, but we did know what we didn't want. She was also very cost-conscious and had good recommendations for alternatives that were a bit out of our price range. She communicated clearly throughout the entire process. Our invites turned out even more perfect than we ever could have imagined and we are over the moon. Perfect experience!

The White Aisle created our stunning "Savannah" wedding invitations. Several people remarked that they were the most beautiful invitations they'd ever seen. Rebecca was a true joy to work with. She was deeply passionate about her work and committed to giving the customer exactly what they wanted. My only wish is that I could refer all of my friends to The White Aisle for their future weddings. Thank you for giving me the most beautiful invitations I could imagine, and all of my support and condolences to you, Dade.

For our wedding, we used Portsmouth Invitation Company for our invitation suites and wedding day details. We were absolutely blown away by the gorgeous details Deborah helped us design and create for our wedding day. Deborah was extremely informative, supportive and prompt. From the invitations, escort cards, ceremony programs and even down to the signature cocktail sign, everything was just perfect. She was always answering our questions and providing us with all we needed to ensure our day was just as how we imagined. We would highly recommend Portsmouth Invitation Company and working with Deborah for your wedding day needs, she is just the best!!

Run, don't walk to Gus & Ruby! If you're getting married anywhere, use Gus & Ruby to make the most beautiful stationery for your wedding! I found Gus & Ruby because I just moved to Boston and was looking for a new stationery company after the first one used for my save-the-dates was not a great experience. From the moment of reaching out to Samantha to meeting in-person to many emails back-and-forth to bring our vision to life, Gus & Ruby exuded professionalism, kindness, and creativity. Additionally, I'm so happy they expertly worked in my mom's artwork into the wedding suite from the map, crest, and other artwork features. Lastly, it was so much fun ordering day-of stationery items with them like stickers, cocktail bar signs, food signs, and more! All in all, I can't recommend Gus & Ruby enough. They provide the highest quality invitations, day-of items, and service to make you feel at-ease and also realistically within a budget too! The amount of compliments we got on our invitations speaks volume for their work! Thank you, Gus & Ruby for making memorable time pieces that I'll cherish forever. I'm going to miss working with Samantha!

It is hard to put into words what an amazing experience my now husband and I had with Sara and the process of designing our wedding invitations! We had a clear idea of what we wanted but also loved Sara's other wedding invitation examples on her website so it was super helpful to get an idea of style/approach with our vision. Sara's attention to detail, beautiful and warm color swatches, and ability to seamlessly incorporate the design across additions like the RSVP card were all characteristics that we appreciated and admired in the process. Sara was easy to communicate with and we received countless comments from our wedding guests about our invitation which to them, felt more like a keepsake than other invites they were used to! We are lucky enough to have now a beautiful framed print of our hand-designed wedding invite hung up on our wall so we can admire it all the time. HIGHLY recommend!!!
