It’s Elegant Design exceeded our expectations in every way when it came to decorating our wedding. Their exceptional attention to detail, creative expertise, and high level of professionalism were evident throughout the entire process. From our initial consultation to the final execution, the team was organized, communicative, and fully dedicated to bringing our vision to life. The final décor was elegant, refined, and elevated the overall atmosphere of our celebration. We received countless compliments from our guests, and we were thoroughly impressed by the quality and sophistication of their work. I would highly recommend It’s Elegant Design to anyone looking for top-tier event décor and a seamless, professional experience.

I am so grateful that we decided to hire Goodwin Lighting for our wedding reception! Goodwin has the tools and talent to transform a room from a typical banquet hall to an absolutely magical, memorable ballroom. The spotlights on the tables and the patterns on the dance floor gave the whole reception even more of a party feel and everything looked especially stunning in photos. Goodwin Lighting does masterful work and did an incredible job making our reception even more beautiful than I could have imagined!

We used Goodwin Lighting for our reception at the Cincinnati Club. They did an amazing job. The Oak Room at the Cincinnati Club is beautiful already but the lighting really transformed the room and made it feel magical! I even knew what to expect but it still took my breath away when I walked into the room. One of the clearest memories I have is looking around the room and thinking, "gosh this lighting is so gorgeous!" It definitely gave the room that extra "wow" factor that we couldn't have achieved through any centerpiece. Glen and Vicki were very easy to work with. I had so many questions when deciding what kind of lighting to use and they were always very responsive and helpful. As another reviewer mentioned, once you decide on your patterns Glen and Vicki take care of the rest. It was nice having one less thing to worry about! If you can fit it into your budget, definitely consider lighting through Goodwin Lighting Services. It was worth every penny!
