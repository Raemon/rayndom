The space is unique and beautiful, and they were flexible and accommodating even given rain (where we had to move the ceremony indoors). We had a nonconventional wedding with different configuration requirements, and they were able to execute the arrangements beautifully. When there was an unforeseen delay at the venue, the Tribe even let us use some suites at Foxwoods for a few hours to do our makeup and prepare. Shantal and Phil were solid venue coordinators in terms of getting all the day-of transitions at the museum: from ceremony to cocktail hour to dinner. I still had to manage most communication with the vendors (you'd need to hire a separate day-of coordinator or wedding planner to do that), but everything went smoothly. I love that we got married on Tribal land. Getting the marriage certificate from the Tribe was a stressful endeavor because of the paperwork required (and you have to schedule a meeting with them 60 days out), but it ended up being fairly easy and straightforward (and you can always elope elsewhere and just hold the ceremony/reception at the museum to bypass this).

We made the decision to have a tiny covid year wedding in Oct 2020 after our original wedding plans were uprooted. Jenna and all of the staff at Latitude 41 were wonderful and truly made an amazing day for us. The venue was more than helpful ensuring we were able to have the type of day we were looking for. Everyone was attentive, the food amazing, and our day truly perfect thanks to everyone who made it happen at Latitude 41. I highly recommend this venue. If you choose them you will not regret it!

The Mattatuck Museum is a hidden gem. The venue was extraordinary! The planning process was easy, largely because of the efforts and attention given by Jaimie, their event coordinator. Jaimie was very flexible with last minute requests and was very responsive throughout the entire process. She worked directly with the vendors to coordinate details, which I sincerely appreciated. The guests enjoyed being able to tour the galleries during cocktail hour. It was a great opportunity to showcase the museum's collection. The rooftop patio for the cocktail hour was amazing! In the days following the event, I received a number of calls from guests stating how impressed they were with the venue. I couldn't have asked for a better coordinated event!

We chose the Bushnell Theater for our wedding as it held sentimental value for our family and it was a unique, "not-your-typical" wedding venue. From the multiple beautiful spaces (ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception), to the responsiveness and professionalism of the staff was unparalleled. Our wedding was out of an absolute dream and I wish I could live that day over and over again.

The Webb Barn was the perfect venue for us because we were looking for a place to have the wedding where we could choose our own caterers and bar. Very beautiful and rustic with lovely grounds and gardens. Katie, who is the contact person, was great, and anytime I had a question or concern answered me right away. This was a destination wedding for us as we all live in Florida, so we had actually booked it from the pictures. Katie made an appointment when I was in Connecticut so I could see it about 11 months prior. The bride ad groom did not see it until a few days before but they really loved it. ( I am the mother of the groom and did all of the planning) I can't say enough wonderful things about the place. They will even open the museum that is associated with the Webb Barn for an additional 100.00, which I thought was a nice touch.

We had to quickly pivot our plans once Covid hit and found Hill-Stead for our elopement was perfect for a covid-friendly event. We worked with Jen and she was so helpful and accommodating. we couldn’t have asked for a better venue for our day - the fall foliage was beautiful. They have tables and chairs to use, so many beautiful photo spots, and really flexible indoor and outdoor spaces. They even have a room that can be used to get ready.

Highly recommend The Carousel Museum as a wedding venue. They were great with communication, the venue has so much character, and I like that it is a non-profit. Didn't even have to do much decorating because the venue is already amazing to look at. We had just under 100 people attend and there was so much room for everyone including the huge dance floor in the middle of the room which we definitely utilized. They made the whole process easy.

We had many guests tell us that was the best wedding they ever attended! Dana from Riverhouse Catering did a great job coordinating our event, attending to every detail and keep me sane. The venue itself is just beautiful so not much decoration needed. The food and service from Riverhouse was also fantastic. They kept our glasses and tummies full. I would highly recommend the NBMAA and Riverhouse catering for a wedding or any big party - they do an amazing job!

I got married here in June of 2015. It is such a beautiful location and Kara Beth did a fantastic job coordinating the ceremony and reception for us. She carefully went through a detailed timeline with us and the caterer and made the day go so smoothly. The venue worked with us on our details and requests. Kara Beth proactively reached out to the other vendors and ensured that everything was on target for day-of. For future couples: Be advised that this venue is fully outdoors and a tent is a necessity (trailer bathrooms also required). Had it rained the backup plan was to have the ceremony and cocktail hour under the tent on the upper lawn as there are limited backup options. It was a risk but it was worth it! Additionally, there is a row of available parking to the back of front lawn that may show up in some "walking down the aisle" pictures.
