Are you a plant lover? Want live plants at your wedding instead of flowers that die?! My wedding was the first wedding that Ruby Flora had ever done and you never would've guessed it! They supplied the centerpieces, party favors, and arch decorations and it truly made my wedding shine. It was the most enjoyable part of my wedding planning process. They communicated with me regularly to make sure what they were supplying was exactly what I wanted and also did set up/break down. Tell them your budget and vision and they'll make something beautiful and personal happen. They are professional, friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate about what they do. Thanks so much you rock! :)

We had such a wonderful experience with Yinzers Cleaning! From start to finish, their communication was outstanding. Always quick to respond, clear and so accommodating. Every member of their team was kind, helpful, and made the entire process stress-free. They went above and beyond in helping us set up and take down our wedding decorations, which made such a difference on our big day. I truly can't recommend them enough for their professionalism, friendliness, and all-around great service.

Mia is the best, seriously a true artist. She is always on time and even came a little early for my wedding to make sure she had parking and everything set up. She stayed on time for each girl (so helpful during a wedding day when girls need to go from makeup to hair etc) and did any required touch ups after some pictures. She did a really cool thing during the trial, to do each side of your face with slightly different makeup so during the rest of the day you could decide which you liked better. Genius! I would love to use her again for any big event, I looked like a movie star!

I had the absolute best experience with Shabby Sisters and couldn’t recommend them enough. They are incredibly professional, and their inventory is full of truly unique pieces. I was a surprise bride, so I didn’t see my florals, tablescapes, or color palette until the day before my wedding and they completely exceeded my expectations. I received so many compliments from our guests, and everything was beyond beautiful!

I rented tablecloths through my venue with this vendor. The samples I were shown matched exactly what was delivered. They were delivered in perfect condition and looked great in my venue. The pricing was also very reasonable. I do recommend using them for any party rentals.

They did a great job setting up a stage for our ten piece band! The process was seamless and they were at a price that worked for us! We would definitely hire them again first 100%!
