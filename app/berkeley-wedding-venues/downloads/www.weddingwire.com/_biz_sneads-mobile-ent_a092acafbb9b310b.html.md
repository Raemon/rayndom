Review of Cut Master D Entertainment Services 

Cut Master D’s Entertainment services were amazing for several reasons. He provided professional guidance on how the entertainment venue would be set up. He always asked what could he do to make my wedding event at Eagle Landing country club in Stockbridge is the Best. He gave us great musical song suggestions, music introduction timing, and his interaction with my wedding guest and crowd was beyond reproach. Very simple hire him if you want a successful event! He aims to please and I will always use his services!

My son's wedding 

DJ Cutmaster D arrived early and was set up before the wedding planner arrived. He was dressed appropriately and had a very positive attitude. He kept my guests on the dance floor through the entire event. I will be booking him again in the near future.
