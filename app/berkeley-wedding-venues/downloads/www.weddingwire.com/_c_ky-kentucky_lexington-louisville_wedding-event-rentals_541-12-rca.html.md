What are some typical wedding rentals?

__

Some wedding venues may include rentals like tables, chairs, china, etc. in their packages. However, some do not—or you may not love your venue’s offerings. In these cases, booking a wedding rental company is a must. Wedding rental companies tend to offer a wider selection of items so that you can find tables, chairs, linens, and more that fit your wedding theme and style. Of course, remember that renting high-end, specialty, or custom items for your wedding can add to your wedding rental costs. Some of the [items you will need for your wedding that can be rented](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-things-you-should-not-forget-to-rent) are:

  * Tables
  * Chairs
  * Dance floor
  * Linens (tablecloths, napkins, chair covers, etc.)

  * Furniture
  * Audio/visual equipment
  * Tents
  * Vases and other vessels
  * China
  * Barware

How much does it cost to rent a wedding tent?

__

If you’re hosting a wedding in an outdoor space, [a tent may be a necessity](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/factors-to-consider-before-you-plan-a-tented-wedding) —both for your guests’ comfort and in case of inclement weather. There are many companies that specialize in tent rentals, and the average cost of a tent rental varies widely, but the average starting price for a tent rental in the U.S. is $300. You may also need to pay to reserve a tent in case of bad weather, even if you don’t end up using it. If you do use your rental, you’ll also have to pay for the labor to erect your wedding tent. There are numerous different types of tents to choose from, including clear-top tents, pole tents, marquee tents, and more, plus you may also need to rent utilities, such as generators, heating and cooling units, and even an outdoor catering kitchen, which can certainly add cost. You’ll want to work with your tent rental company to determine the best type of tent and any related utilities you will need for your special day. 

How much does it cost to rent a wedding altar?

__

Renting a special altar for your wedding can add a unique touch and personality to your ceremony, especially when it is decorated with flowers by your florist. Many wedding rental companies offer altars and arches, as well as chuppahs and mandaps. In the U.S., the average starting price for an altar or arch is $75. Work with your venue, florist, and rental company to determine if an altar or arch is something you’ll need for your ceremony, and how it can be decorated. 

How much does it cost to rent wedding reception tables?

__

There are a variety of different wedding reception tables to choose from, depending on your wedding style and the types of tables your venue can accommodate. While round tables are the most common, square and long rectangular tables are also (on-trend!) options. The average starting price for wedding reception tables in the U.S. is $8 per table. You’ll want to ensure you know the reception table shapes and styles you’ll be featuring at your wedding so you can [create an accurate seating chart](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-create-your-wedding-seating-chart) and plan your decor accordingly. 

How much does it cost to rent wedding chairs?

__

Renting wedding chairs may seem pretty straightforward but there are actually [lots of chair options available](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/11-popular-wedding-chair-styles). From standard folding chairs to elegant Chiavari chairs, modern ghost chairs, rustic cross-back chairs, and more, you have many options when it comes to wedding chairs, both from a style perspective and cost. In the U.S., the average starting price for wedding chair rentals is $2 per chair. While renting folding chairs can be a less expensive endeavor, you may also wish to rent chair covers to dress them up.

I highly recommend Bryant's Renta-All for any wedding, party, celebration or anything you are planning. We were so pleased with their availability and patience with us as we planned a wedding from the ground up. We were happy with the staff we used from this company as well. I just cannot say enough good about this company! They took care of us very well on everything we needed. Sincerely, The Moore Family!

The owner Lakshmi is very friendly and professional! She puts a sincere effort in meeting the customer’s needs and expectations, and willing to accommodate your needs! She immediately responds to your texts or phone calls, in other words, in a timely manner.

Rustic and More provided phenomenal value and service. They offered a virtual consultation, were able to match our wedding colors easily, and had a variety of extra rental options that helped add character and atmosphere to our ceremony. Pick-up and drop-off of our rentals was both easy and simple. We had bad weather the week before our wedding (in January), which caused some sourcing issues for our Chiffon runners, but they were able to help us quickly resolve the issue. A family company that treats you like family.

"Went to our first silent disco last Fall and it was seriously the coolest experience ever! I brought a few friends with me for their first experience too! Half the night we were on different channels but we continued to vibe all through the night. Whether the channels were the same or not. Walking over to get food and nobody has headphones on in that area but I did...I felt like the life of the party bc I kept on dancing and nobody had a clue what I was listening to. But you could tell they were interested! If you haven't been to one yet 10/10 recommend!!" I've been to a handful more of these events and everytime it's so much fun! Our school hosted an event for graduation and seeing that many people in one space all connecting and dancing the night away was pure magic!

I honestly gave her colors, and a small vision. I told her to work her magic and her and her staff did just that. The venue was beautiful! Tyiesha was great. She communicated with me the whole 6 months during preparations and very informative the week of my weeding.

I found Southern Classic Rentals through a recommendation from a friend. Drew had the cross-back chairs we were looking for at a great price....and was fantastic to work with through the entire wedding planning process. Chairs were beautiful, delivered and set up perfectly, and were picked up after wedding reception ended. Cannot say enough about the great experience we had working with Drew. Extremely professional and dependable! Will definitely use them again should the need arise.

We used EWD for our wedding reception at Buffalo Trace. Carrie so easy to work with - after we gave our initial direction we didn’t have to do anything else. They were timely and executed our vision to perfection. Loved how our lights turned out!

Edwina Taylor saved us. With a last-minute need for chair covers, she didn’t blink. She delivered the covers a day ahead for our wedding with no extra charge. She even picked them up for free. The covers and sashes arrived in perfect condition with no wrinkles. The covers and sashes made all the difference in the appearance of the reception. Absolutely beautiful! She was a pleasure to work with. I highly recommend this company. They are professional and dependable.
