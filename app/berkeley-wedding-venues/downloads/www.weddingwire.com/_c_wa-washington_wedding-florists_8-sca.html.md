Sam's Floral Design was so great to work with! Sam did an amazing job with all the bouquets and boutonnieres. The bouquets turned out better than I imagined. They captured all the colors and types of flowers I wanted. She was very responsive when I had questions and was easy to get a hold of. She also makes wonderful preserved bouquets, which are such a nice way to keep some of the flowers from your wedding day. I love mine! I would highly recommend working with Sam's Floral Design for all your floral needs.

My wedding budget didn’t allow for much but I really wanted a nice bridal bouquet and bridesmaid bouquets. I really liked that I could just choose from a few color options. She doesn’t do full custom bouquets. But I did request to add a few flowers to tweak it a bit and she did that. She was really accommodating.

We are so lucky to have worked with Josie for our wedding florals! She took my vague ideas of what I wanted and turned it into the most stunning arrangements, better than anything I’d seen online or could have imagined. Josie is a true artist and it was amazing to see her pick the perfect flowers and turn them into such magical pieces, you can tell she loves her job and puts amazing thought into every flower choice. Each arrangement was not just beautiful but a stunning work of art. The flowers were fresh, vibrant, and perfectly complemented our color scheme. Josie paid attention to every detail, incorporating unique elements that truly made our day special. Everyone loved them and couldn’t stop talking about them! I cannot recommend Josie enough, she will make all your floral dreams come true!

Daisies in May recently provided flowers for my daughter’s wedding. Loreen is experienced, talented, dependable and very capable. From our first meeting I had complete trust in her ability to execute the vibe we had envisioned. Not only was she agreeable to the vision, she suggested creative additions to make the venue beautiful and unique. The morning of she arrived with a team and worked her magic to make everything perfect. At the end of the evening the team was there to disassemble and did so quickly. We received compliments from many guests on how beautiful the flowers were. I would highly recommend Daisies in May if you are looking for unique & beautiful wedding flowers and a florist that is trustworthy and easy to work with!

Betty did our wedding florals for our Vancouver Island wedding. She was professional, engaging, and incredibly helpful in consulting with us to help craft the perfect floral vision with the colors and look we wanted. Betty created a beautiful grounded floral arch, boutonnieres for the bridal party and all our guests, a gorgeous maid of honor bouquet, and a stunning bridal bouquet in our moody jewel tone palate. I would highly recommend Daisy & Wish to anyone looking for florals for a wedding, party, or other event. Thank you Betty!

Von was great from start to finish. I made tons of changes to my order and she accommodated everything. I ordered a cascading bouquet and received tons of compliments. Everyone loved the large centerpiece flowers and the table centerpieces were beautiful.

Kira was wonderful to work with. She was great with communication. She offered advice and helped with the design process. From start to finish she was easy to work with. I gave her inspiration photos and she was able to create that and more. She is very talented and amazing at design work. We were so grateful to have her a part of our big day. No regrets. She came to the venue and helped set up and decorate. It made our wedding morning less stressful getting things ready. I am so happy we chose Kira to help create our floral design. I would recommend her. Thank you Kira! You are the best!

I absolutely loved working with Valentina’s Floral Design! The flowers were stunning—truly beautiful arrangements that I couldn’t stop admiring. Rita is a dream to work with—responsive, attentive, and incredibly kind. She really listens and works with you to bring your vision to life, no matter how specific or unique. On the day of the event, everything went so smoothly. I didn’t have to worry about a thing—just enjoyed the beauty and calm that her work brought. If you want breathtaking florals and a stress-free experience, I highly recommend Valentina’s. Rita is truly wonderful!

Colleen was an absolute delight to work with! She was so kind and friendly throughout the whole planning process and was very quick to answer any questions we had. She provided a wonderful reference document that made it very clear what we were paying for and what to expect! Our flowers were stunning and the arrangements on the arbor and tables were honestly breathtaking! Colleen was efficient at setting up and helped make our vision come true. We cannot recommend her enough!
