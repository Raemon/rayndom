Theresa and her helper catered my wedding this past September. I live in PA and planned a destination wedding in AK. I was doing a Google search of caterers in the area when I stumbled upon Great Land Events. I am so lucky that I chose them to cater the best day of my life. Theresa was incredible from the moment I first spoke with her on the phone over a year before my wedding. You would think planning the wedding menu over the phone would pose a challenge, but Theresa made it as easy as possible for me. She presented me with the most perfect and well thought out menu, down to the appetizers, desserts, and all in between for my 25 guest wedding. She went to the airbnb where my wedding was held a year in advance and offered to FaceTime me so I could see my wedding air bnb. When I unexpectedly wasn’t able to make the FaceTime call, she did the next best thing and recorded videos to send to me so I could “see” my vision come to life. I truly can’t thank her enough. She kept in close communication with me via email and text/call, was very quick and timely in her responses, and provided my friends and family with the meal of a lifetime. She arrived timely on wedding and got right to work. Her food was absolutely INCREDIBLE!!! Every single one of my guest was floored with the food and dessert options. I was beyond impressed with everything. It truly was more than I could have ever imagined. She also made my wedding cake, and it turned out even better than my inspo pic! (It looked like a birch log- my guests literally thought it was real. People were absolutely shocked to find out it was cake!) Theresa and her staff member attended to myself, my friends, and my family all evening. They were extremely thoughtful and set a few appetizers aside to ensure my husband and I could enjoy them before we headed off for pictures. As soon as I got back from pictures, the first thing Theresa did was offer to make me a drink. They were moving nonstop the entire night, whether it was setting up the food in a beautiful display, offering out appetizers, filling guests water glasses, or cleaning up dishes. All in all, I could not recommend Great Land Events enough. I was always told the biggest thing people remember from your wedding is the food. They weren’t lying! My guests STILL talk to me about her amazing food and service a month and a half later! THANK YOU Great Land Events from the bottom of my heart for making my wedding absolutely perfect!!!!

The Master’s Catering team did an amazing job on the food at our wedding. We struggled to get Anchorage caterers to communicate with us, but after we signed on with Wes and his team, the rest was easy and delicious! They brought a big grill to Copper Landing, our reception location, so everything was hot off the grill and perfectly timed for dinner. We had lots of compliments from guest about how delicious everything was (“best wedding food ever”), and we totally agree! Also heard from other vendors that Master’s Catering is “consistently delicious”. Highly recommended!

Sal's team was very easy and flexible to work with. There was a hiccup in the arrival of my food as well as some dessert forgotten to be put out as the stress came about with not being able to find my venue, but overall I have zero complaints! They worked with us on a customized menu that fit our price range and were amazing at putting together a delicious menu that everyone could enjoy! Sal personally called me to apologize and made everything right, and I was very grateful to speak to him. He was so very nice and I'm happy our perfect day worked out well in the long run! Thank you, Sal. We will be working with you again!
