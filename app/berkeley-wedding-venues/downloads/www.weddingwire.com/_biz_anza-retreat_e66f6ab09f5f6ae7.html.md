**~Weddings at Anza~**

Anza can be transformed into an intimate wedding venue tucked into the Berkeley Hills, offering a peaceful, nature-forward setting just moments from the city. Thoughtfully designed for heartfelt gatherings, the space welcomes couples and their closest people to celebrate with intention, ease, and a sense of grounding.

**~About Anza~**

Anza is a private hillside retreat for couples drawn to a more intentional, non-traditional wedding experience. Framed by elder trees, warm light, and open views, the property feels quietly removed while remaining easily accessible from Berkeley and San Francisco. With on-site lodging for up to 18 guests, Anza is well suited for intimate weddings, elopements, and multi-day celebrations that unfold over time rather than on a strict timeline.

A mix of indoor and outdoor spaces allows ceremonies, shared meals, and moments of pause to flow naturally throughout the day and weekend. The environment supports both celebration and restoration, giving guests room to gather, reflect, and truly be present. At Anza, weddings are less about production and more about connection.

**~What’s Included~**

  * Exclusive use of the Anza property
  * Overnight accommodations for up to 15 guests across 7 rooms
  * 4 full bathrooms
  * Upper and lower scenic decks for ceremonies and gatherings
  * Indoor spaces adaptable for reception, dining, and dancing
  * Sunlit common areas and tea lounge
  * Full kitchen with cooking and serving ware (catering-friendly)
  * Japanese hot tub, sauna, and cold plunge
  * Indoor and outdoor movement space
  * WiFi, sound system, projector, and A/V support
  * Direct trailhead access to Tilden Preserve
  * On-site parking for up to 10 vehicles, with nearby off-site options



**~Anza Is Best Suited For~**

  * Intimate weddings and thoughtfully scaled celebrations
  * Elopements and ceremony-centered gatherings
  * Multi-day wedding weekends with close friends and family
  * Nature-forward, wellness-inspired, or non-traditional weddings
  * Couples seeking a calm, grounded alternative to large event venues



Anza is designed to foster presence and connection. If you’re envisioning a wedding that feels personal, unhurried, and rooted in shared experience, this space was created with that spirit in mind.

**~Celebrate Your Story~**

We offer a supportive, hands-on hosting style while leaving space for your vision to lead. Couples are welcome to work with their own planners, caterers, florists, musicians, and vendors, or to collaborate with trusted local partners we’re happy to recommend.

Ceremonies can be held on our outdoor grounds with sweeping views of Tilden Park, accommodating up to 100 guests. Receptions may be hosted indoors across the Sunset/Yoga room, living room, and outdoor deck, depending on your desired flow and layout. Each space can be configured for dining, dancing, or both, allowing your celebration to evolve naturally throughout the evening.
