We cannot recommend Andrew Kruse and the Ultimate Entertainment team enough! From the moment we booked to the very end of our wedding night, everything was seamless. The planning process was super easy thanks to their website and online tools, definitely helped us remember details we would have otherwise missed. Andrew was beyond professional and friendly. He took the time to walk through everything with us before the big day, and even helped us troubleshoot when we couldn’t find our coordinator (he didn’t have to, but we were so grateful he did). On the day of, he was flexible, calm, and went above and beyond. The AC went out on the hottest day of the year, and he powered through with such grace. I even made a last-minute dress change and one of my bridesmaids asked him to reintroduce me and he nailed it without hesitation. Our music was exactly what we wanted. He honored our preferences and communicated with us before playing any guest requests, just as we’d discussed. We truly can’t imagine a better DJ experience. Andrew exceeded all our expectations and made the night unforgettable. Huge thank you as well to Sean for all the support leading up to the day. Choosing a DJ can feel risky, but we absolutely made the right choice. We’ll be recommending UE—and Andrew specifically—to all our friends getting married in the future! Thank you so, so much to the UE team and Andrew! ❤️

Corey was absolutely amazing. We could not have had a better DJ for our wedding. I am extremely grateful that Corey cared so much about our wedding day and making sure everything went perfectly. Corey made sure to communicate with us multiple times and document a timeline so we stayed on track during the big day, this made everything go so smoothly

Our DJ was phenomenal! They played the perfect mix of fun, upbeat music that kept everyone on the dance floor all night. The floor was literally packed from when it started to when the venue was kicking us out lol. They were so respectful of our 'do not play' list while seamlessly taking requests from our guests. Super prepared and professional, they knew exactly how to read the crowd and keep the energy going. We’re so grateful for their incredible work—it made our wedding unforgettable!

We had DJ Clife and team for our New Year's Eve wedding and couldn't have been more happy with our choice. Clife provides outstanding preparation with attention to detail that ensures the entertainment and production for your day are exactly what YOU are looking for! To give a little insight on his process - we had multiple zoom meetings to go over the schedule of events and discuss details (what type of music you'd like, entrances, lighting, speeches, etc.). It's truly impressive how Clife is able to take what we discuss in those meetings and bring your dream to life. Everything flowed perfectly and really fit our vision. Some additional features we utilized that Clife offers included the Saxophone player, 360 photo booth, and videographer. One especially cool and unique feature the videographer offers was a same day professionally edited video that we were able to watch alongside our wedding guests later in the night. Very impressive turn around time to put that together and it was super well done! If you are looking for enhanced production value and someone to entertain your guests in a way that uniquely fits your vibe, Clife and his team are an 11/10 recommendation.. Extremely worth it!

Garrett Rain was amazing! He called the week of the wedding to discuss details we had previously spoken to Twisted Mics about and made sure he had everything correct so that we could have the best and most personal experience possible! All staff was responsive and answered any questions we had. I also did a mash up song for my father daughter dance and they took care of that for me! Everyone loved the music at our reception!

Travus was awesome from start to finish. He was so easy to work with and was on top of things from start to finish. He had the dance floor packed from beginning to end and went above and beyond to make sure the timeline of the wedding stayed on point. We also had Travus come the evening before for karaoke for our guests and that was a hit! He followed our requests but also just handheld everything that came his way - I didn’t have to worry about anything with Travus running the show. He offered a great price and was super flexible. I would highly recommend!!!

Puttin' on the Hitz made our holiday wedding the absolute best! Michael was so amazing and helped guide us through the entire day. The ceremony was flawless and we were so grateful we were working with a professional service. We talked to several different vendors before deciding on Puttin' on the Hitz. Michael made us feel so comfortable from start to finish. The reception was the icing on the cake with a great mix of music for all of our guests. We decided to go an extra hour because our guests didn't want the party to end. Thank you Puttin' on the Hitz for making our wedding such a perfect day!

We went through Complete Weddings + Events for both our DJ and photographer, and they were absolutely incredible from start to finish. From the beginning, Kim, our main contact at Complete, was so helpful, responsive, and flexible. She kept us in the loop and made sure everything was on track. Their online planning system was also super easy to use, which made organizing everything much less stressful. As for our vendors, they were phenomenal. Our photographer, Hope, was far and away the best photographer we could have ever asked for. She was so communicative throughout the entire process, doing multiple Zoom calls to get to know me and my husband and really understand our vision for the day. She even looked through my Pinterest board and created a full shot list ahead of time, which she had on-hand day-of. Hope helped build our photography timeline and it worked out perfectly. She made everyone feel comfortable and at ease, gave clear direction to make photos feel natural and candid, and was so fun to be around. On top of that, she brought her Polaroid camera and gave us a little album of instant photos from the day such a thoughtful touch. It was nearly 90 degrees on our wedding day, and she was still willing to move around our large venue, scout different photo spots, and never once made us feel rushed. We’ve only received our sneak peeks so far (which she delivered within days!), and we are blown away. I truly could not recommend Hope more she was professional, fun, and so incredibly talented. I feel so lucky we had her capturing our wedding. Our DJ, Cody, was also amazing! He kept the energy up all night, read the crowd perfectly, and made sure everything flowed smoothly from the reception entrance to the last song. He was great with announcements and timing and really kept the party going. We also added the lighting package, which elevated the dance floor and helped everything feel like a real celebration. If you’re even slightly considering using Complete Weddings + Events do it! They were incredibly affordable for the level of service we received and made our day feel seamless and unforgettable. Thank you so much to Complete Weddings, Kim, Hope, and Cody we couldn’t be more grateful!

We can’t say enough good things about Music Man Productions and the role they played in making our wedding day truly special. The DJ can make or break a reception, and Curtis absolutely delivered. He took the time to meet with us multiple times, listened closely to our preferences, and understood our music style and event timeline in detail. His attention to details helped ensure everything ran smoothly and felt personalized. The value we received was perfectly aligned with our budget and expectations. The dance floor was never empty. We highly recommend Music Man Productions!
