April

I reached out to A Touch of Magnolia for custom candles for my Bridesmaid proposal boxes. She created a super cute, personalized label for each of my girls that included the colors of the wedding and room sprays for each box. The room sprays were phenomenal and of course the candles smelled AMAZING. My bridal party loved their proposal gifts, and I am placing another order for their "day-of" gifts. The customer service is TOP TIER. Shandell is truly a gem. I was initially indecisive about what I wanted, and she really helped me bring my vision to life. I ended up having to change my wedding date, which was printed on the label, and not only did she reassure me that a reprint wasn't a problem, she also provided some words of encouragement that calmed my anxious heart. She even sent a stress relief candle just for me in my order. I highly recommend A Touch of Magnolia for all your fragrance needs. It's the perfect "touch" to add to any gift for your bridal party, Mothers of Bride/Groom, etc. My fiancé and I both will forever be customers!

I’ve always wanted a portrait from my wedding and Victoria made it happen. She took an old dark photo and created a beautiful portrait which shows all the joy and love from a very special day.
