Las Brasas catered my big birthday party with my family and it was such a breeze! The Las Brasas team came early to set up and it looked really great once it was done -- I didn't have to worry about anything! I ordered the ceviche (my favorite), the charcoal roasted chicken, empanadas and plantains. Everyone raved about the food-- I was not surprised! Thank you Las Brasas!

We chose Café Natalie as our bar service for our wedding at the Gallery, and we have nothing but positive feedback. The bar staff was highly professional, displaying efficiency in both set up and service, as well as during the cleanup. No complaints whatsoever.

We used Bailey Connor Catering for my daughter’s wedding in September 2023. All I can say is WOW! I think every single person at the wedding commented on how delicious the food was.

I hired Courtney's Catering for my organization's staff holiday luncheon and was so beyond impressed! I have worked in hospitality and event planning industry in Austin for many years, and finding a good caterer has always proven extremely difficult. Leading up to the event, Brandi was extremely communicative and flexible with my needs. There was a long period of time where things kept getting delayed on my end due to my organization's policies, but Brandi remained so patient, kind, respectful and accommodating throughout the whole process. On the day of the event, her and her team arrived on time and set up a stunning buffet complete with layered linens and touches of greenery. For the price I paid I was expecting just a standard black tablecloth and chafers on a table, so I was very impressed with the presentation. It made it very clear to me that this is a business that takes pride in their work. On top of this already great experience, the food was fresh and delicious. I am not exaggerating when I say every single thing was seasoned to perfection! I went around to each table and asked everyone how they liked everything, and they all commented on how flavorful the food was. Even our staff with dietary restrictions that received alternative proteins were impressed. I had only paid for the basic-level buffet service, so I was't expecting them to do anything beyond serving the food- but I was yet again pleasantly surprised when I looked up and saw Brandi and her team walking around to each table bussing plates. This was not expected of them at all and I was so amazed with the level of service throughout the entire event. I will absolutely be hiring them for more events in the future, and I recommend you do too!

CAC went above and beyond to deliver an amazing culinary experience for our wedding guests. CAC was so easy to work with and threw in many complimentary items to ensure we could achieve what we wanted for our wedding within a reasonable budget. They were kind, professional, and most importantly - had AMAZING food. I am still dreaming of the short rib, stuffed mushrooms and chicken taquitos. The food was truly incredible, but we also had fun experiences provided like a coffee/hot coco bar and a late night snack. Our guests raved about how great the food was. I couldn’t be more thankful for CAC and their white glove service!

My husband and I hired Blue Mesa Grill to be our caterer for our wedding day, and the food and service were phenomenal. The staff was so kind to everyone at the event and were very mindful of making sure all the guests got their food on time and were happy! We ordered the Fajita Grill Dinner, and it was absolutely delicious. We were also so happy that they were accommodating of our guests who had dietary restrictions. If you are having a wedding and are thinking of hiring someone to cater your event, Blue Mesa Grill is the way to go. Trust me when I say you won’t be disappointed.
