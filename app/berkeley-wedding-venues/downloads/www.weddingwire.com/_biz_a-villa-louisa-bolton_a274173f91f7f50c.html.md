The Best Wedding Venue! 

I am so impressed with A Villa Louisa and I’m so happy we chose them as our venue. From the consistent communication from our wedding coordinator Ashley, to the absolutely amazing food and hors d’ouvres- our wedding couldn’t have gone any better. I had multiple guests compliment the food- which went above and beyond my expectations. They were even so helpful to accommodate great meals for our guests who had food allergies. Ashley helped me bring our vision to life- and even when things inevitably went wrong she was able to navigate through it and find an even better solution. She was so helpful the entire night, making sure I had everything I needed and making sure I was comfortable. The hospitality & care from A Villa Louisa will always be remembered by us, and I couldn’t recommend this venue more.

Beautiful, excellent service, attention to detail, and amazing food 

I love A Villa Louisa for so many reasons. Their venue is beautiful, food is amazing, their attention to detail is on point, their staff is willing to go above and beyond, and most importantly their management team is superb. Not only do they have a beautiful venue but they offer off site catering and bar services as well. I am a wedding and events planner and I have extremely high expectations. I would recommend them 100 times over! Thank you for being a genuine business. You are so refreshing and I love working with you!

Exceptional!

"A Villa Louisa" gets kudos from this couple in going about and insuring that my husband,Blair and I, had a very safe and rewarding experience in every aspect within our nuptials! Michelle,our coordinator, dealt with the ongoing change with COVID and made the proper adjustments in making our wedding "A Hallmark Type Style Wedding"  
My husband even sang to me while reciting his vows to me!  
The Food so excellently prepared by Asim Etem and his culinary crew..was tasty to the palette and our guests seem to enjoy as well!  
  
Highly Recommended!

A Perfect Wedding Reception at Villa Louisa

Our wedding reception in August 2021 at Villa Louisa was truly outstanding in every way! Michelle and her staff were excellent. From the start of our planning process, Michelle was so helpful providing guidance and suggestions to make this a special day for the bride & groom, family and friends. Villa Louisa made it the perfect wedding reception. 5 STARS!

Beautiful venue.

A Villa Louisa was a beautiful venue with several outdoor locations for pictures. My coordinator was helpful and knowledgeable. I was amazed at how beautiful my reception was. The food at the tastings was overwhelming but on my wedding day all selections were delicious.

Amazing Atmosphere 

A Villa Louisa is one of the most amazing places we have been too. Michelle and Asim are so professional and really up to date with their clients. My husband and I first found by accident and fell in love I told him if we ever got married this was our place. 2.5 years later we finally tied the knot. Even through the pandemic They were so helpful and kept us to date with everything going on. The communication was amazing they really know how to plan a wedding. Highly recommend to everyone
