Real talk: Figuring out how to address your wedding invitations might be one of the most tedious parts of wedding planning. Even if you’ve got a stationer or [calligrapher to do the dirty work for you](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-calligrapher), you still have to [corral all of your guests’ names and mailing addresses](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/wedding-guests-list.html), which can take a few days short of a lifetime (don’t even try to imagine what it was like doing this before the Internet, it’ll make your brain hurt). And still, just when you’ve think you’ve hit a rhythm and have totally got this whole addressing-150-envelopes thing on lock, you still aren’t out of the woods yet, because guess what? There are rules here, too! And I don’t just mean using pretty penmanship. Check out these tips on how to address your wedding invitations to make sure you’re ticking all the right boxes for drama-free, non-offensive envelopes.

## First, a few general do’s and don’ts when it comes to how to address wedding envelopes: 

**Do:** Use full names. Always use full, given names as opposed to nicknames.  
**Do:** Find out guests' pronouns before addressing their envelopes.   
**Do:** Give distinction where it’s due. Your friend from undergrad didn’t spend the past 10 years of school and infinite dollars to not be called a doctor at every possible opportunity. Include titles like “Dr.,” “PhD,” “Esq.,” where appropriate, and if you’re not sure, ask!  
**Do:** Fully spell out street names, like Lane, Court, Street, Road, etc.  
**Do:** Spell out numeric street names. For example, write Sixty-Seventh Street, rather than 67th Street.  
**Do:** Include [serious partners and plus-ones](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/plus-one-etiquette) by name whenever possible, rather than writing “and guest.”  
**Do:** Keep in mind who’s divorced. Just like you shouldn’t leave new partners or titles off the envelope, calling someone a Mrs. when they’re not anymore might ruffle some feathers.

**Don’t:** Forget to be super-clear about if children are invited. Include them on the envelope by adding “and Family” after their parents’ names.  
**Don’t:** Abbreviate street names. Write out the full name of a state, rather than using its two letter abbreviation.  
**Don’t:** Abbreviate North, South, East, West.  
**Don’t:** Abbreviate the generational suffixes “Senior” or “Junior.”

## Wedding envelope addressing templates

### **Married couple, different sex, same last name**

List on the same line. Use the “Mr. and Mrs.” title, followed by the man’s full name, or write out each person’s first name. You can put the woman first, if you prefer. 

_Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Johnson_  
 _or_  
 _Mr. Samuel and Mrs. Eliza Johnson_

### **Married couple, same sex, same last name**

List on the same line. Use the title “The Mesdames” for two women and the title “The Mssrs.” for two men, followed by both first names and the couple’s last name. If you don’t want to be this formal, simply substitute the title “Mrs. and Mrs.” or “Mr. and Mr.”

_Mrs. Suzanne and Mrs. Deborah Jones_  
 _or_  
 _The Mesdames Suzanne and Deborah Jones_

_Mr. Robert and Mr. Peter Smith_  
 _or_  
 _The Mssrs. Robert and Peter Smith  
_

### **Married couple, different sex, different last names**

Write out each full name with “Mr.” or “Mrs.” Man or woman can go first, depending on your preference.

_Mr. Frank Smith and Mrs. Grace Apple_

### **Married couple, same sex, different last names**

List on the same line. List both full names, each preceded by the appropriate title, on the same line with the “and” conjunction.

_Ms. Lisa Chan and Ms. Angelica Green_  
 _or_  
 _Mr. Bradley Washington and Mr. Walter Randolph_

### **Two married doctors**

Use the title “The Doctors” or the abbreviation “Drs.,” followed by their last name. 

_The Doctors Lilian and Thomas Wallis_

### **Different sex married couple, woman is a doctor who uses married last name**

List both names on the same line. List both full names, each preceded by the appropriate title, on the same line with the “and” conjunction. The woman’s name should be listed first and preceded by the “Dr.” title.

_Dr. Lilian and Mr. Seth Weinberg_

### **Different sex married couple, woman is a doctor who uses maiden name**

Same as above, but include woman’s last name.

_Dr. Suzanne Jones and Mr. Joshua Turner_

### **Different sex married couple, same last name, man is a doctor**

List both names on the same line. Use the title “Dr. and Mrs.,” followed by the man’s full name.

_Dr. and Mrs. Jared Cooper_

### **Married couple and their children (Under 18)**

Use the rules above for the first line. On the second line, list the children’s first names in order of age.

_Mr. and Mrs. Michael Randall_  
 _Carolyn, Julie, and William_

### **Married couple and their children (18 and Over)**

Children who are over 18 should receive their own invitation, addressed to them individually:

_Ms. Sarah Franklin_  
 _or_  
 _Mr. Asher Kaplan_

### **Unmarried couple**

List each guest’s full name, preceded by the appropriate title, stacked on two separate lines. It doesn’t matter whom you list first; when in doubt, go alphabetically. If it’s a long-term couple, you may put the couple’s names on the same line. 

_Ms. Betty Roosevelt  
Mr. Jonathan Samson_

_or_

_Ms. Betty Roosevelt and Mr. Jonathan Samson_

### Non-binary guests

For guests who use "they/theirs" as their pronouns, which may include those who are gender non-binary, gender fluid, and/or trans, Mx. is the correct honorific to use.

_Mx. Jordan Frank  
_ _Mx. Blake Ellison and Mr. Drew Tran  
_

### **For a guest with a plus-one**

Preferably, you would know the name of the plus one in advance. If not, you may include “and guest” after the guest’s full name.

_Ms. Jessica Miller and Guest_

### **An unmarried woman**

Use the “Ms.” title, followed by her full name.

_Ms. Rebecca Pear_

### **An unmarried man**

Use the “Mr.” title, followed by his full name.

_Mr. Barry Forte_

### **A widowed woman**

Ask a loved one if the woman would prefer to be referred to by her married name or her late husband’s name.

Married name: _Mrs. Olivia Yarrow_

Husband’s name: _Mrs. Richard Yarrow_

### **A divorced woman**

Both the “Ms.” and “Mrs.” title are acceptable, followed by her first and last name, whether she kept her married last name or goes by her maiden name.

_Ms. Leah Warren_  
 _or_  
 _Mrs. Leah Warren_

### **A married couple, same last name, man is a judge**

List both names on the same line. Use the title “The Honorable and Mrs.,” followed by the man’s full name.

_The Honorable and Mrs. Roger Allen_

### **A married couple, same last name, woman is a judge**

List both names on the same line. List both full names, each preceded by the appropriate title, on the same line with the “and” conjunction. The woman’s name should be listed first and preceded by the “The Honorable” title. 

_The Honorable Rashida Benjamin and Mr. Eric Benjamin_
