Worked with Marissa for my wedding at King Gillette Ranch in May 2025. Since the venue requires rentals for just about everything, from the kitchen to the tables and chairs and linens and bars, I needed a partner who could be flexible and help me navigate an event and venue of this coplexity. Marissa and Party Pleasers were so responsive, and helped me from October through May, working with us throughout the entire process to put together an incredible event that looked beautiful and had everything we needed where we needed it. They have an eclectic array of items and always were on top of all of the numbers, estimates, and new information being thrown their way as our wedding shifted. Multiple guests commented on the mismatched vintage chairs - they were a huge hit! Thank you so much Marissa and Party Pleasers.

We used Chic Rentals for our wedding and our rehearsal dinner, and it was a delight to work with them for both events! Communication was always quick and easy, and they worked seamlessly with us through multiple changes to our order. It was so much fun going through their showroom to look at all the designs they have available, and we were able to create the tablescapes of my dreams!

Judy and the team at Ventura Rentals were wonderful to work with for our wedding day. We were introduced to them through our wedding planner who had worked with them many times and they did not disappoint. They even opened their showroom for us on a day it's normally closed so that we could view their rentals after driving in from out of town. Their delivery and pickup was professional and friendly, we highly recommend them.

We’re able to get linens and tables and chairs for the best price when shopping vendors on the Central Coast. Tables and linen were delivered directly to the venue for convenience. It made wedding rehearsal and wedding day seamless.

We mostly worked with Tent Merchant through our wedding planner but we did go to their physical location in Santa Barbara to see what they had in advance, which was helpful. Everything we received looked perfect. Pickup and dropoff went smoothly at the scheduled times.
