Couldn't recommend them enough - we got so lucky with PGC!

The Presidio Golf Course created a memory of a lifetime for us. We couldn't thank them enough.   
  
We looked pretty much high and low for a beautiful venue in the Bay Area that was also convenient/accessible, easy to communicate with, and not unreasonably priced. Presidio Golf Course was EVERYTHING we wanted in a venue and more.   
  
PGC and Tracey Lyons were so extremely professional and easy to work with. We were able to secure a tour within 24 hours of messaging this venue, and we were blown away by a few things: the capacity of the venue, the beautiful tent on the terrace, the beautiful golf course and the scenery behind it, and the extremely friendly and professional staff.   
  
On the day of the wedding, we felt the venue completely transformed with their attention to detail. It was also nice to work with their preferred vendors (i.e., Hensley Event Resources) who provided the reception linens + chairs and just made the place so beautiful. We also highly highly recommend their preferred cake vendor, Kathy's Creative Kakes. Tracey was also so flexible in letting us bring whichever other vendor we wanted and made this process SO easy. Some venues have a lot of requirements but she trusted us with our vendors and there was little to no red tape. The venue also comes with insurance, as well as a tasting (which was AMAZING) where they will customize the menu and food exactly to your taste. Tracey and her team also provided the set-up on the day of the wedding, as Tracey and Erin were our day-of coordinators, and laid it all out to a tee. With everything this venue provided, we were stunned STILL at how reasonably priced things were -- whereas some venues elsewhere were going to give us half of what PGC gave us, for double the price.   
  
When Tracey says that they'll make the day perfect and exactly the way "you want", we felt she 100% meant it and delivered on that. I've never seen anyone so detail-oriented and making sure these requests/requirements from the B+G are met (even if they seem small!)  
  
If we had another wedding in some other lifetime, it would still be here. We are SO grateful that PGC threw a beautiful and perfect wedding for us, and more importantly, our guests had fun and let us know that. Thank you Tracey and PGC team!

Wonderful experience with Tracey Lyons

Working with Tracey put me at ease. Her experience and professionalism were beyond my expectations! She literally was able to "predict the future" and help us make informed decisions that spared us stress and heartache on our wedding day and general planning. Her response time to emails and phone calls I wish people would take a lesson from her on that. It was flawless which made her so accountable and trustworthy. This is what every couple needs in a very fun yet, stressful time in their lives.  
Tracey is an asset to this venue.

A Perfect Day

Tracey and the Presidio Golf team went above and beyond to make our wedding day perfect. From the first meeting to the day of, we always had an open line of communication and felt like we could ask anything. Tracey graciously fielded every single question we had, including concerns about allergies, weather, layout, price, etc.   
  
The venue itself was absolutely perfect for us, with a combo of indoor and outdoor space. We had around 120 people, and thought the team accommodated our guests beautifully. The drinks were delicious, the food was spot on (tater tots especially were a huge hit), and they even played the Warriors game during cocktail hour at our request. Unexpectedly, I fell in LOVE with a new cheese that I had not tried before; needless to say the cheese board was a big hit as well.   
  
I honestly could not have asked for a more perfect day, and I know I owe most of that to the Presidio team. I did not feel like I had to worry about a thing. Our ceremony and reception space were set up perfectly; the team took care of arranging our memorial, gift, and party favor tables; and we were doted on all night. My partner and I just had to worry about getting married and having fun. I wish I could do it all over again - the best night of my life and we could not thank the Presidio team enough.

Great wedding venue!

We had our wedding here in November 2022 and it was a great decision. The main reasons we decided to go with them were location, value, food, and staff, and they did not disappoint.  
Location is obviously great and having a free parking lot in SF is rare. Also loved the beautiful nature vibes inside the city. Really great value compared to other spots in the presidio / sf.  
Tracey was easy to work with and was very flexible. She frequently found ways to save us money.   
The food was one of the highlights of the wedding and all our guests raved about it after. We really wanted to not have one of those weddings with mediocre food so we’re super pleased with that. There was also plenty of food for everyone.

Excellent venue - perfect for planning from abroad

I planned my wedding from abroad (8 hour time difference) at Presidio Golf Club and it ended up being perfect. Tracey is really really responsive and helpful, most of all she's really sweet!!! The level of flexibility and transparency were paramount - it was so easy. I highly recommend this venue for the quality of service. We held our ceremony and reception at the venue and the flow of events was smooth and not confusing at all for the guests. The day-of coordinator, Erin, was also fantastic, in fact I barely interacted with her on the day of because everything was just that flawless! Food is delicious and bar service was top. The food came out hot and really well presented.   
The venue itself is beautiful. Outdoors you can see a view of the city (provided that there isn't any fog!) and there's also a great eucalyptus pathway right by the clubhouse which offers great photo ops, so you can have great group photos there as well. Indoors the tent is great - lighting is nice, you barely even need to add decor to the room. The club house is newly renovated and has really nice evening vibes. Highly recommend having your wedding ceremony and reception here!

The Team Delivers a Wedding to Remember

The grooms selected the venue and did all the planning (with some talented professionals) so I experienced the event with the guests. Simply put, the wedding was exquisite and a day I will remember forever. Tracey convinced us to hold the ceremony & reception at the club even though I was a bit concerned about the public nature of the golf course. Rest assured; the team delivers.   
  
Here are a couple observations that you might find helpful:  
  
Food: Our first experience with the food was at the tasting. (I will note another location was not even willing to do a tasting.) Chef Dirks was a partner, sharing his experience and ideas, which were very helpful in determining the menu. At the wedding, the service was fast and efficient, and the entire staff was thoughtful and responsive. Of course, the culinary star of the evening was the food. I heard so many compliments – the taste, how well everything was cooked, the presentation. It was a homerun!!  
  
Facility: Not a detail was overlooked by Erin who was our logistics point person. Her collaborative spirit and good cheer were much appreciated – as well as her suggestions based on an extensive knowledge of the site. Erin also had a “can do” attitude about the enhancements we wanted and worked to make the grooms’ vision a reality. The setting was absolutely gorgeous and perfect in every way!  
  
In short, the team was amazing and made the wedding one to remember for a lifetime.

Best Wedding Decision 

My husband and I were married at the Presidio Golf Course in May of 2022. It was the best decision that we made. Right from the start Tracey was commutative and extremely accommodating. The team took care of everything, from set-up to take down. We didn’t have to worry about a thing. We were also able to have our pup Cooper be a part of our special day.   
  
The food was amazing, wait staff on point, service was impeccable.   
  
We loved that guests had free parking, the venue was all one level and it was in the beautiful Presidio. The pricing was more than reasonable. We’d definitely recommend Tracey and her team to everyone!

Lovely Wedding!

We want to thank you Tracey and her team for organizing the wedding for us! She is super helpful and nice. Getting married during the pandemic was not easy but Tracey helped us a lot to get through it easily. She absolutely understood our worries and tried her very best to make our wedding day perfect. From planning the date, choosing a wedding package, food tasting, venue decorations, and on the day of, the whole process went so smoothly and everything was done perfectly. We did a lot of researches and went to a lot of venue visitings, we finally found our dream place. PGC was a perfect place to hold a ceremony and reception in San Francisco for us. Because we wanted to have a convenience place for our guests to commute (most of our guests were from SF), a reasonable price, pet friendly, and can do sparklers. Also, not to mention that most of the venues have a lot of restrictions but Tracey trusted us and my other vendors. We honestly have nothing to complain about. The food and wine were so tasty, our guests loved it so much that they are still talking about it after 5 months of our wedding! Words cannot describe how glad I am to have Tracey and her team helped us to organize our wedding. All of our guests said that it was the best wedding they have ever attended.

Fantastic venue for our perfect wedding

Choosing the Clubhouse at the Presidio was the best decision my wife and I could have made for our wedding. The Clubhouse was the third venue we looked at on our first day of venue tours and after a quick walk around and a 10 minute talk with Tracey we were practically sold. Tracey was instrumental in the planning and execution of our wedding. She helped us every step of the way to design the perfect wedding.   
  
We found the overall layout and decor of the space to be fantastic. The clubhouse has nice wood cladding on the walls, a large stone fireplace and leather chairs giving the space a very cozy and old time feel which we loved. An especially nice touch is that they provide all the furniture and linens you need with multiple color choices, they even include a wedding cake! Included in the cost is a trip to a local cake makers shop where you can design your own wedding cake.   
  
My personal favorite part of having our wedding here was the food. Their chef, John Dirks is a phenomenal chef. It was so difficult to pick our appetizers and entrees after the tasking because every single item was amazing. I was really happy to find a venue that had such a talented in house chef.  
  
We feel very fortunate to have found the Presidio Clubhouse to use for our wedding. Tracey and her staff were awesome and made planing and having our perfect wedding seem easy. I have already recommended this venue to two of my friends and will continue to recommend it. We could not have been happier with how everything turned out.

Incredible

I am so happy we chose the Presidio Golf Course and Clubhouse for our wedding reception. My husband and I had a really hard time finding a venue that met all our needs. I really don’t enjoy stuffy hotel ballrooms where your guests are stuck at their dining spot sitting all night or on the dance floor. The Presidio Club House offers multiple spaces including an outdoor space, so that it is easy for you and your guests to move around. Another big concern for us was accessibility for our elderly family members. The club house has plenty of close parking and everything is on one floor. We did not want a lot to think about on this big day and having a venue that had tables, chairs, linens, catering, and alcohol with all the coordinating done by an amazing director, Tracey, was so incredible. Knowing that we wouldn’t need to worry about coordinating vendors or paying to rent chairs and things was so nice. Everything was perfect thanks to the Presidio Golf Course and Clubhouse and all their employees. Even when our DJ was an hour and a half late and off cue the whole time, they made everything work. My grandmother can’t wait for a reason to throw another party here!

We loved working with Michelle and her staff! They were very professional and easy to work with. The most important thing was that they were all about the bride and groom. All they wanted to do was to make sure they were happy. On top of all of this, is that the venue is stunning! I would highly recommend them to any bride and groom! :)
