Foxtail Cottage Floral did our wedding flowers and they knocked it out of the park! Our colors were orange and blue, and I was nervous how those colors would look together, but man was I proven wrong! The bouquets were absolutely stunning, and I would hire Foxtail again in a heartbeat! They were extremely responsive, and pickup was so easy and convenient. Thanks Foxtail!!

Working with Donna was absolutely incredible. She was very quick to respond and was so helpful in helping our vision come to life. From the very first phone consultation to wedding day, Donna was amazing. I actually started to tear up with I saw our Chuppah on wedding day, as it was everything I was envisioning and more! She made our tables look fantastic with greenery, candles, and flowers. And the flower collar she made for our pup was so sturdy and is still together months later!! Highly recommend working with Colonial Florist!

I ordered bouquets, corsages, and centerpieces from Fluttering Flowers and they turned out amazing! Debra was super helpful during our first meeting before I even fully knew what I wanted. Her prices were very reasonable and she was very flexible about updating the orders for changes in guest RSVPs. Highly recommend her if you are in the Virginia Beach area!

I cannot recommend Gloriosa enough. Mary Jo is an absolute delight to work with—she took the time to understand and clarify our vision, was super communicative throughout the whole process, and is a genius with flowers. She turned our fall floral vision into a reality with stunning bouquets, hair pieces, arch decor, and arrangements around the venue. All under our budget! You are in the kindest, most talented hands here!!

My husband and I were so pleased with the team at The Flower Cupboard and the beautiful florals they provided for our wedding! Cathy was extremely helpful at the initial consultation (especially since we knew literally NOTHING about florals going in). She pulled together an amazing quote for us at a great value. In the months leading up to our wedding, Cathy was super responsive whenever we had a question and coordinated with us to make sure our florals would arrive at the correct time to our ceremony and reception locations. On the day of, the delivery team was extremely kind and helpful, and super efficient when setting up our centerpieces and other decor. All of our bouquets, corsages, and boutonnieres were gorgeous and lasted well throughout the day. We are so thrilled with the service we received and would definitely recommend The Flower Cupboard to any couple!

Aside from deciding to get married, working with Graceful Designs was the best decision we made for our wedding. She came highly recommended from my sister in law & a ton of of my sorority sisters. From start to finish, Tanya was the definition of patient, thorough, kind, and creative. I came to her with a big vision and a lot of moving parts ( four events across our wedding weekend in different locations and nine vendors!) and she brought it all to life flawlessly and was always just a phone call/text away! I really don’t know how she does it! Every detail was intentional and beautifully executed. The florals were stunning, the decor was beyond what I imagined, and she made the entire process feel seamless and stress-free. I woke up on my wedding day able to have such fun girl time with my bridesmaids because I knew she had every detail handled! She provided us with a personal assistant to help things run smoothly since we had two different event locations and were also getting ready in different locations. If you’re looking for someone who is not only talented but also genuinely cares about her couples, look no further. I can’t recommend Tanya & Graceful Designs enough. I couldn’t have prayed or dreamt of a more beautifully executed celebration!
