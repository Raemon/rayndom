I can’t say enough amazing things about Susanne’s Weddings! From start to finish, Laurie and the team were incredible to work with. They took my vision and brought it to life even more beautifully than I could have imagined. Every detail was absolutely perfect, and I was blown away when I saw my flowers on my wedding day. The arrangements were stunning, fresh, and truly made the whole day feel magical. I am so grateful for the time, care, and creativity that went into everything. If you’re looking for a florist who will make your dream wedding come true, look no further—Susanne’s Weddings is the best of the best!

I sent Alyssa some inspiration photos of flowers I liked, and she went above any beyond to make my dreams come true! She made me a bouquet even more beautiful than the pictures, it was absolutely perfect. I still obsess over it in wedding pictures often. I can’t believe how beautiful it turned out. I highly recommend Alyssa and Flourish Foliage co. for any event! She was quick to respond, checked in periodically, as needed, and even delivered my flowers to me that morning at the hair salon next door.

I had an amazing experience working with Anne! She was thoughtful, well-organized, and incredibly detail-oriented when it came to bringing my vision to life. From our first meeting to the wedding day itself, Anne made the entire planning process so much easier and stress-free. The flowers were absolutely stunning and exceeded my expectations — we’re still getting compliments on our floral displays to this day! I can’t recommend her enough to anyone looking for beautiful, personalized florals and exceptional service.

For my wedding day, I asked for whites and ivories with some soft florals and lots of foliage, and Becky delivered the most perfect bouquet (and matching boutonnière)! It was exactly what I wanted, and absolutely exquisite with the early fall and pale yellow backgrounds of my photos. I couldn’t recommend Ford Flowers more - they do excellent, beautiful work, and are so responsive and lovely to work with!

Lyndsey was so easy to work with and the price for quality and quantity of my wedding flowers was absolutely unbeatable. She checked in with me as my wedding date was close to ask if I needed to make any changes and was happy to accommodate whatever I needed. All of the arrangements were beautiful and delivered perfectly on time. 10/10 would recommend Lyndsey Loring for your floral needs.

Linda was amazing from start to finish. We met in person to plan and she checked in frequently through email. She was timely and far surpassed my dream flowers! Linda helped us stay in our budget and offered extra ideas, if and when we wanted them. I will use Linda again for any future floral needs and would recommend her to everyone!

Jes was INCREDIBLE to work with! She was so sweet and professional throughout the whole wedding planning process and she made sure every last detail was exactly the way I wanted it. She was so organized and communication was a breeze. She went over the order with me multiple times to make sure everything was perfect. You can tell she really cares about her clients and wants everything to be as stress-free as possible. Not to mention AFFORDABLE. She doesn't overcharge people like a lot of florists tend to do, and she will work with you to make something you love that is in your budget. I couldn't believe how beautiful the arrangements came out, and I wouldn't change a single thing. I can't thank Jes enough for decorating my wedding so perfectly! I would recommend her to anyone in a heartbeat!

I cannot recommend La Flora Couture enough! From start to finish, she was absolutely incredible to work with and completely exceeded my expectations. I had a vision for our wedding florals, and she brought it to life even more beautifully than I could have ever imagined. Every detail - from my bouquet to the courages and boutonnières to the reception centerpieces \- was absolutely breathtaking. The colors, textures, and arrangements were perfection, and the flowers lasted beautifully throughout the entire day. I received endless compliments from guests about how stunning everything looked. Beyond her amazing talent, Valerie was kind, organized, and so easy to communicate with. She truly cared about making our day special and it showed in every detail. I'm so grateful for the time, effort, and heart she put into making our wedding florals absolutely unforgettable. If you're looking for a florist who will go above and beyond and turn your vision into a dream, book her! You will not be disappointed!

Our jaws are still on the floor from the gorgeous florals, table scape and ceremony space that Mary created for our wedding day. Mary partnered with our planner, Azalea Events, flawlessly, and our virtual calls were one of the highlights of wedding planning. Rather than a specific color palette, we were looking for florals to match the tone we wanted for the day - organic, elegant, and a little wild. Mary is truly a master of design!!

Tracy was wonderful to work with! We had several last-minute changes before signing our contract, and she was very accommodating and responded quickly to communications. On the day of, everything was beautiful! Tracy did a great job with the arrangements. Our color palette was unusual for a summer wedding (orange, blue, and purple), and she had a lot of fun with it which showed in the final result. My husband and I can't recommend Tracy and Simple Bouquets enough.
