There is not a more intimate moment to share with a stranger than your wedding day. But by the time you stand there at the alter Claire is no longer a stranger. Claire makes sure of this by meeting either in person or virtually, sending carefully curated questionnaires and asking the right questions. She read our owes and offered feedback and most of all by the end of the process but before getting married she understood us. Thank you Claire, for making our ceremony so special.

We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect officiant for our wedding. From the very first conversation, Carletta brought warmth, professionalism, and a calming presence that made the entire process seamless. On the day itself, her words were heartfelt and beautifully delivered, creating a ceremony that truly reflected our love story. We’re so grateful for their role in making our day unforgettable.

We had such a wonderful wedding day with Takeisha Brown as our officiant! My husband and I's wedding was a reception-only event, so we planned a table signing of our wedding certificate with Takeisha during the morning of our wedding, for just the two of us to attend. We were expecting the table signing to be a quick impersonal thing, but Takeisha made it such a special moment for us. She put on a micro-ceremony for us and said some beautiful words. My husband and I were both tearing up during it, even though it was just the three of us there. Takeisha clearly loves what she does and is very good at it, and I highly recommend her as an officiant!

My husband and I loved the backyard setup, especially with the snow. Beautiful backdrops and spots to take pictures. I recommend this place for anyone wanting a small and intimate wedding.

Beautiful little spot in Richmond, VA that will give you a beautiful wedding. The space of the chapel itself provides an elegant intimacy for small ceremonies or elopements. We were thrilled with the vows, the flexibility and the immediate responsiveness of the owner. It was a beautiful ceremony and we will cherish the memories forever.

Jennifer was a perfect choice for our officiant! I immediately noticed her calming and kind energy during our first call before we officially booked her, and after booking, she provided a lot of helpful information. Her template for the ceremony speech was awesome, there were really great options for us to pick from as a non-religious couple. She walked us through our rehearsal smoothly and did a perfect job day of. I had so many people comment on how warm she was and how they assumed we knew her before our wedding. I highly recommend using her!

Melody is simply wonderful, and hiring her was easily one of the best decisions we made for our wedding! Melody delivered the most heartfelt, humorous, captivating, and personal ceremony we could have ever dreamed of. She truly has a special gift. Melody has an incredibly warm, kind, and calming presence. We met with her in person, and she spent over an hour just listening intently to our story, asking incredibly thoughtful questions, and taking diligent notes. She even had us submit separate answers about what we love about each other to ensure the ceremony was personal. We gave her minimal guidance, we wanted a modern ceremony that had some spiritual rather than religious elements, and she took that vision and ran with it brilliantly. She was super flexible and allowed us to make any changes to the script well in advance, ensuring we were 100% happy. She wrote the homily herself, and it was so fun listening to her beautifully unfold our love story from the beginning. Our guests were laughing, crying, and completely drawn in by her words. We received numerous compliments, with guests immediately asking for her information for their own upcoming weddings. Melody's ability to capture each of our personalities was incredible, and we truly wouldn't change a single aspect. It was the highlight of our wedding, and we will cherish it for the rest of our lives. If you want a knowledgeable, kind-hearted, calming, and personal officiant, look no further than Melody.

Chuck is fabulous! We really had a great time working with him - he's very laid back, flexible, professional, respectful, and punctual. He was very accepting of our requests to have a non-religious ceremony, asking all kinds of questions to ensure he customized a ceremony to match our needs and personalities.

Carol Charles Bach was the perfect officiant for our wedding. We couldn't have been happier with how the ceremony went and how Carol worked with us on a few extra touches we wanted to include. She was great about us having a non-denominational wedding overall but including a few touches of my Jewish religion. We asked her to sign our Ketubah, she obliged and had no issue with us displaying it. We also asked to end the ceremony smashing the glass and she was happy to do so. Carol really worked with us and made the ceremony perfect! She is also very reasonably priced for her services and our guests enjoyed the ceremony.
