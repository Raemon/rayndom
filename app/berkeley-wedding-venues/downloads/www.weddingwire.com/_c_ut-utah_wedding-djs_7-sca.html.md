Jordan was our DJ at our June wedding up in Alta, UT. He was one of the absolute highlights of the night. He read the crowd perfectly, incorporated our must play songs, and added his own guitar riffs and jams. Everyone had a blast dancing all night long! Thank you Jordan for making our wedding the party of our dreams!

Drew was great to work with at our wedding in 2018. He played good music and kept the party going! He also listened to our requests and didn't play the genres we didn't like which was awesome. Definitely recommend him!

Shane is incredible! We did a package including DJ services, officiant and sparkler send off and it was so worth it. He was great at keeping the reception going and upbeat. The officiant was awesome, great sense of humor and perfect for the bride and groom. Would definitely recommend! Only downside is that sometimes it took some time to get a response as he is really busy during wedding season.

Besides the 5 star rating, we would give ADM Productions and DJ Brax D, 10/10! We had a great virtual meeting with Braxton before the wedding and it became abundantly clear we were all on the same wave length musically and that he would do an amazing job.

I wasn't sure what to expect, or if anyone would use the service, but it turned out to the highlight of the event, with nearly every guest getting pictures with each other and the couple. We had an awesome attendant for the booth who was helpful, sweet, engaging and adjusted to the limited space on short notice. Would definitely recommend for an event.

I first wrote a review for Josh months before my wedding because I was so impressed with his professionalism and care during the planning process. Now, after my wedding, I can confidently say he exceeded all my expectations and played a huge role in making my big day unforgettable. From the start, Josh stood out. Even though my destination wedding was in Southern California and he was based in Utah, he was more helpful and involved than anyone else I worked with—including my wedding planner. He took the time to truly understand my vision, asked thoughtful questions, and helped me picture how the day would unfold. His support made decision-making so much easier and reduced my stress throughout the process. On the wedding day, Josh went above and beyond. When there was an unexpected issue with our wedding planners, he stepped up without hesitation, helping to coordinate the timeline and ensuring everything stayed on track. His calm, professional demeanor in a potentially chaotic moment was such a relief. During the reception, Josh completely nailed the vibe. He kept the energy high and the dance floor packed, with the perfect mix of songs that appealed to everyone—from our older relatives to our friends. The transitions were flawless, and many of our guests couldn’t stop raving about how great the music was. Josh, thank you for everything! From making the planning process so enjoyable to ensuring our wedding day was seamless and fun, you were absolutely incredible. If you’re looking for a DJ who truly cares about your vision, stays calm under pressure, and knows how to keep a party going, Josh is your guy. I can’t recommend him enough!

DJ Mitch Ross came highly recommended to us by a friend and we were so happy with his services! He responds promptly to every text and email in a professional manner. He met with our daughter and future son in law weeks in advance to come up with a playlist together, and we all couldn’t have asked for a better experience. He came prepared with everything necessary for setup, helped us host and keep everything organized with an event itinerary, and was the most fun and organized DJ throughout the night. Several people approached us afterwards to let us know it was the most enjoyable and fun wedding they’ve ever attended. Thank you so much for making it the perfect night!
