We couldn't have asked for a better photographer for our wedding. Trung was incredibly professional, patient, and easy to work with from start to finish. Beyond just taking amazing photos, he went above and beyond throughout the day - helping with boutonnières, stepping in with little details wherever needed, and keeping everything running smoothly. Managing a wedding is no easy task, and he handled it all with grace and expertise. We're thrilled with how our photos turned out and would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a photographer who truly cares about capturing your day perfectly.

Alvis was our first photographer, found him on Livingsocial and after looking through his portfolio, seeing his quality of work we wanted to give it a try for a session. When I first spoke with Alvis, he was professional, truly kind and had great customer service. He is very responsive, responds to emails promptly. He's generous with his time and when we worked with him, we felt that he genuinely cared about us and wanted to do everything he could to make our lives easier. My Wife and I are extremely happy with the photos from our shoot. thank you

We loved working with Ranjith and found him to be incredibly professional and understanding. From the very first meeting, he put us at ease and was super easy to work with. He is extremely talented and was able to capture and highlight moments from our small wedding in San Jose this past summer. We loved all our wedding photos! We would highly recommend Ranjith's services!

Sean is professional, punctual and a genuinely kind person. He did a wonderful job capturing and creating beautiful moments from our queer, femme handfasting ceremony. We all felt comfortable with him immediately. He was very open to requests and also provided a lot of helpful guidance. He was also very gender affirming in his photography and it never felt forced. I’m so grateful we found him, the photos took my breath away. I absolutely recommend him for anyone looking for a skilled and experienced photographer. 10/10

Russ is absolutely incredible and was one of the best decisions we made throughout our wedding process! We worked with Russ for both our engagement photos last year and our wedding, and both experiences exceeded our expectations. Our wedding photos are absolutely stunning — he delivered over 1,800 beautiful images that perfectly capture the emotion and joy of our special day. You can truly feel the love and happiness in every shot. What sets Russ apart is his dedication to his craft and his clients. The weekend before our wedding, he went above and beyond to help prepare by second-shooting a wedding at our venue specifically to scout the lighting for our wedding photos. This level of commitment is unmatched and really shows how much he cares about delivering the best possible results. Throughout the planning process and on our wedding day, Russ was completely professional and worked seamlessly with all our other vendors. He captured all the moments that mattered most to us, and his style beautifully reflects the emotion of the day. As an added bonus, he delivered our photos quickly and his editing work is fantastic. We cannot recommend Russ highly enough — if you want a photographer who truly goes the extra mile and delivers incredible results, he's your guy!

We're sooo happy we chose Tim as our videographer! We appreciated how simple and straightforward his process is, plus how open and flexible he was to our needs. He is so kind, fun, and easy to work with. The final videos he made are beautiful and well-made, from the song choices to the moments he highlighted. We know we'll cherish these videos for the rest of our lives because there's truly nothing like being able to re-live the best day of our lives. Thank you, Tim, for capturing our wedding so perfectly!

Nick and his Angi were an absolute dream to have on our wedding day. From the very beginning, they made us feel so comfortable and cared for. Their professionalism and calm energy set the tone for the entire day, and the prep they did ahead of time made everything run seamlessly. We never once felt rushed or staged, just completely present in every moment. The photos capture the heart of our day so beautifully; I still get emotional looking at them. If I could do it all over again, I’d choose Nick and Angi in a heartbeat. Truly the best decision we made.

Hellena is incredible and is essential for any wedding (or event)! We intentionally searched for a wedding photographer with experience working with BIPOC and LGBTQ+ couples. From our initial introductory call over Zoom, we felt an immediate connection with Hellena - and were confident she'd be able to capture the moments most meaningful to us. In the months and weeks leading up to the wedding, Hellena provided recommendations and suggestions for how we could best structure our day, and was a critical voice in helping us finalize our day-of wedding schedule. The day of the event, she seamlessly became an organic part of our broader wedding party. She helped to ensure we stuck to our schedule, gave firm yet kind direction when coordinating all of the necessary photos, and immediately put us at ease. She created a sweet video reel for us and all of the photos she took were amazing. Her eye for timing, for serendipitous moments, and for special must-have shots was impeccable. We were very emotional when we looked through our wedding photos for the first time. I genuinely cannot share enough praise for Hellena.

## San Francisco Wedding Photographers: How to Find the Right Wedding Photographer in San Francisco to Capture Your Special Day 

An urban oasis located alongside the Pacific Ocean, San Francisco is a city for dreamers and doers. The City by the Bay is home to national novelties like the Golden Gate Bridge, as well as local obsessions such as the mission burrito. Whether you’re a tried and true resident of the city or simply stopping in for your wedding, there are a few things you should know about San Francisco wedding photographers, and WeddingWire is here to help you navigate your way. 

## How to Find the Best Wedding Photographers in San Francisco

You should be beginning your hunt for the perfect S.F. wedding photographer at least one year before your[ wedding date](https://go.weddingwire.com/wedding-date). Once you have your timeline synced up and have accepted that hiring a professional camera crew will be about 10 percent of your[ wedding budget](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/wedding-budget.html) (in San Francisco you can expect to pay a minimum of $3,000), it’s time to get down to the nitty gritty. As you research various San Francisco wedding photographers, you want to examine their portfolios and verify that their style aligns with how you want your wedding to be documented. Additionally, you and your partner should be your prospective lead photographer in person to feel out whether you get along. Your wedding should be a day of celebration, so you need to ensure you vibe well with your vendors. 

## Best Places in San Francisco for Wedding Photos

It won’t be difficult finding a beautiful place for wedding pictures in the city, as every bit of San Francisco is scenic – you just might have trouble narrowing it down to one or two locations. For the couple who thrives outside, pictures on the sandy shores of Ocean Beach are a must; the craggy coastline perfectly captures San Francisco’s oceanic allure. Presidio Park is another outdoor destination that will make your wedding photos look like something out of a fairytale. Not to mention the park is massive, so you should be able to find plenty of spaces to take pictures without a random cyclist tucked in the background. Looking for something less woodsy? The Palace of Fine Arts is a whimsical architectural wonder in the center of the city, and can shield you and your lover from any stray San Francisco rain. 

## Best Times of Year for Wedding Photography in San Francisco

Loving San Francisco means embracing its gray, rainy weather. No matter what time of year you’re getting married in the City by the Bay, you always want to make sure you’re accounting for random rainstorms. Have indoor photography options available, and always stick a spare umbrella in a backpack (you wouldn’t want to mess up your wedding ‘do). That being said, weather is moderate year-round, which means you can’t go wrong getting hitched in S.F. 

Start crossing items off your[ wedding checklist](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-checklists.html) and preparing for your big day. The helpful planning tools available at WeddingWire make organizing your wedding simpler than cutting cake.
