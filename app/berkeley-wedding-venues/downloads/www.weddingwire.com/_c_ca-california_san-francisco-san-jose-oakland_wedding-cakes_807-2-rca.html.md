## How much does a wedding cake cost?

Having a wedding cake at your reception is one of the biggest (and sweetest!) traditions. But what does a wedding cake cost? While wedding cake prices do vary depending on the size and style of your cake, the average cost of a wedding cake in the U.S. is around $500 with most couples spending between $300 to $700. While this may sound like a lot for a dessert, you’d be surprised as to how much work goes into creating a gorgeous wedding cake.

  * __ $ 150 or less Lower range
  * __ $ 500  Average cost
  * __ $ 355 - $ 725  Most couples spend between
  * __ $ 1,067 or more Upper range



Costs displayed are based on spend from thousands of couples who recently reported pricing for this service within their WeddingWire review. Pricing varies based on factors including, but not limited to, vendor’s experience, level of expertise, event guest count, date, and geographic region.

Which factors impact wedding cake prices?

__

Not surprisingly, the bigger and more elaborate a wedding cake is, the higher the cost of a wedding cake will be. A wedding cake featuring lots of design elements, including sugar flowers, fondant details, many tiers, and unique shapes, will cost more than a simpler cake with classic buttercream icing, a few fresh flowers, and fewer tiers. While your flavor choice likely won’t have an impact on your wedding cake’s price, requesting certain custom flavors may raise your wedding cake cost a bit. 

What is the starting price of a wedding cake?

__

The starting price of a wedding cake can vary depending on the type of frosting you prefer. Cakes covered in fondant, a sugary paste-like icing, tend to cost more than cakes covered in buttercream (frosting made from butter and sugar). Fondant is more durable than buttercream (and it [won’t melt in the summertime](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-expert-tips-to-avoid-a-summer-wedding-cake-meltdown)!), but it’s generally thought of as less tasty. The starting price of a fondant wedding cake is usually about $5 per slice, while the starting price of a buttercream wedding cake is about $4 per slice. Again, these wedding cake prices will vary even more based on decorations, size, etc. 

What’s included in the cost of a wedding cake?

__

This varies from cake baker to cake baker. Usually, the cost of your wedding cake will include the cake itself, a design consultation where your baker will create a custom design just for your wedding, [caketasting](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/everything-you-need-to-know-about-a-wedding-cake-tasting), delivery and set up. Some cake bakers will also include supplies like cake stands, [cake toppers](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/top-types-of-wedding-cake-toppers), and cutting utensils, though you may have to provide these on your own. And some wedding cake prices include an [extra top tier of your wedding cake](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-preserve-your-wedding-cake) or anniversary cake for you and your spouse to enjoy on your first anniversary. 

What types of desserts do wedding cake bakers offer?

__

About 54 percent of couples choose to serve an additional wedding dessert, aside from or in addition to wedding cake, at their receptions. Cake bakers may offer a variety of these alternative wedding desserts, including [cupcakes](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/15-reasons-why-we-still-love-cupcakes), cake pops, cookies, pies, pastries, doughnuts, and more—the starting price for cupcakes is about $3 per cupcake. There are also groom’s cakes, which are a tradition particularly in the South. We’ve seen these [groom’s cakes](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/cakes-desserts--t23) shaped like everything from sports paraphernalia to burritos! 

When should I hire a wedding cake baker?

__

We recommend hiring a wedding cake baker at least six months before your wedding day—these vendors do tend to book up quickly! Start by [reading online reviews of wedding cake bakers near you](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-cakes), and selecting a few to interview (in person whenever possible). You’ll typically have a wedding cake tasting after you’ve booked your baker, where you’ll [select your cake’s flavors](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/favorite-flavor-combinations-from-real-cake-bakers).

The perfect wedding cake for a beautiful day. Delicious flavors - the vanilla and raspberry was great for a refreshing spring choice. We ended up picking the same cake shop & flavors as my husband's mom did 30 years ago! The custom cake topper with our dog, which somehow shipped out of an Etsy shop in Ukraine, was the...icing on the cake:)

Having Asian flavors for our wedding dessert bar was important to us, and we searched high and low for a vendor that both produced delicious desserts and would be able to deliver to Sonoma Coast for our wedding. We are so thankful for Always Yours! From the very beginning, the experience was easy and seamless. Their catering options were easily accessible online, and we appreciated the many photo examples on their website. After filling out their contact form, we got a response from a sales representative quickly. We visited the bakery to try out both their cake and dessert tasting boxes, and we were sold! They were very generous with their portions in the tasting boxes - we even had to give some away to our friends and family. It was actually quite difficult to choose which flavors and desserts we wanted because we loved them all. We ended up going with “The Grand” catering package with the following: Hojicha, matcha, strawberry cake, Cupcakes - cookies and cream, Mini cheesecakes, Mini fruit tarts, Mini lemon meringue tarts, Ube crinkle cookies, 8 dozen regular macarons (black sesame, jasmine milk tea, lychee, passion fruit, pistachio, strawberry cheesecake, tiger sugar, white rabbit candy). Our guests loved the desserts! Delivery was timely and smooth. We would absolutely go with Always Yours again.

Shout out to Krishna, TheCakeWhisperer! She was amazing from start to finish. We absolutely loved our wedding cake, and our guests couldn’t stop talking about how gorgeous it looked. It brought everything together. Krishna was so kind and accommodating throughout the whole process. We were planning our wedding from New York, but Krishna was super flexible with our schedules and even let us do the tasting the week of the event, which we really appreciated. She was also super helpful when it came to the design. We really wanted a 3-tier cake and found some inspiration on Pinterest. Krishna worked with us to bring our ideas to life, making the cake even more beautiful than we imagined. She gave us great advice on everything, from the cake design to finding the perfect stand to ensure it fit our vision and florals. We’re so grateful for her and her talent. The cake not only looked amazing, but it tasted incredible too. Thank you, Krishna, for making our day even sweeter
