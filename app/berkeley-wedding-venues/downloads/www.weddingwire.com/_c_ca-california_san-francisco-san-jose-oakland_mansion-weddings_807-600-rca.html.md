We had the most amazing wedding in July here at Willow Heights Mansion!!! Our day was beyond perfect. Everything from the planning process to the day of the wedding went so smoothly thanks to all of the vendors and especially our coordinator Christina!! We were so nervous leading up to the wedding day, but once we met Christina during our rehearsal we knew she would do an incredible job. She made sure to update us throughout our wedding day, kept track of all of our guests, made sure we had a meal/drink ready at our sweetheart table waiting for us after our ceremony and kept checking in with us to make sure we didn’t need anything else. She kept us on track and on time for everything throughout the whole day. I didn’t have to worry about a single thing. I could not recommend this venue and Christina enough!! We cannot thank this team enough for making our day so special and memorable❤️

It's true what they say, "finding the perfect wedding venue is like finding a great partner". We reviewed and visited SO MANY places to have our wedding and stumbled upon a rare gem in the Bay Area - The Allied Arts Guild. We discovered them on Here Comes The Guide (online wedding platform) and it looked promising! Independently, one of our really good friends also mentioned that AAG would be perfect for us so we finally decided to check it out. The second we walked onto the premises into the garden, we knew it was our place. The feeling it gave us, the wonderful weather, the local cats moseying through the rosebushes, the stunning wisteria covered trellises - everything about it was perfect. We met the venue coordinator, Tiana, that first day and we were pretty much sold. Working with Tiana has been such a wonderful experience while planning our wedding. She is massively accommodating, flexible, kind, welcoming and a true pleasure to work with. From the get-go, we let Tiana know that we wanted to have an unconventional wedding with unique aspects that were authentic to me and my partner and Tiana was so supportive of all our ideas. She helped us figure out cool ways to use the entire space of the Allied Arts Guild, let us explore unique seating arrangements, dream up a magical cocktail hour experience, fold in an live acoustic performance and dished up the most AMAZING food + cocktails for the evening. I just have to reiterate the food comment again - QUITE LITERALLY THE BEST WEDDING FOOD I'VE EVER HAD. The passed appetizers included mini beef wellingtons, lamb riblets and shrimp tostadas and our mains consisted of an incredible beef short rib & grilled salmon dishes that we could literally hear our guests raving about. As a bride, the biggest advice I kept getting was "make sure you remember to eat during your wedding". I mean, I already knew how good the food was from Cafe Wisteria (the restaurant at AAG who catered for our wedding) and when I say I cleaned my plate during our wedding dinner, I'm not exaggerating. It was DELICIOUS!!! Tiana and whole Allied Arts Guild team went above and beyond to bring our our wedding dreams a reality and we had the most magical day of our lives. We have so much gratitude for everyone there, especially Tiana - it was more than we could have every imagined. So professional, welcoming and wonderful to work with. Working with Tiana has been such a positive experience for us and not only did we have the most wonderful wedding, we also gained a wonderful friendship with Tiana through the process. Thank you to the entire AAG team for hosting our wedding. We had the time of our lives and can't thank you all enough for everything!!! xo Monica & Eli

We got married on September 23, 2023. Honestly, I couldn't have asked for a better venue. It was sophisticated and elegant, but also convenient given you can do everything on site. One thing to know about Kohl is that it's just the venue; nothing else is included. Which we took as a win, as we wanted to choose our own vendors, and also bring our own alcohol (which Kohl lets you do at no charge). We found our photography & catering vendors through their recommended list. Denise as our main POC was a gem, absolutely phenomenal in person though occasionally a little delayed over email. I really felt like she cared about making our day special, and she was very quick to share photos of other events to give us ideas, or help us brainstorm how to use a room. She didn't end up being our POC day-of, but Carol was wonderful too. As for the guests' experience, it was so good. There's plenty of parking on site, and we had a Welcome sign that easily directed them to the patio for refreshments before the ceremony. Honestly the only snag was that the grass was a bit soft and squishy so it wasn't the easiest to walk in. But then moving to the patio for cocktail hour was so seamless. And then when everyone went into the main hall for the reception, it was just beautiful. We ended up having dinner & dancing in the main hall, dessert in the black & white room, a lounge area in the white / green room, a game room in the library, and used the hallway near the staircase for a video booth. Guests being able to use so much of the space throughout the night, including the outside patio too, was so nice. The other thing I'll mention is the rooms upstairs — they have a beautiful groom's room and bride's room. You can't be there all day, just as soon as your time window starts, which for us was at 2:30pm. But then we also were able to turn the groom's room into a nursing / babysitting room for folks with little ones. All in all, I'm so thrilled we had our wedding at Kohl — it was a dream!

We had our ceremony in the chapel, and our reception out on the terrace. It is just the most beautiful place, right on the foothill of Mt. Tam. It looks like a fairy tale. We also stayed on campus, as they also offer a few guest houses, which were perfect for housing the bridal party and hosting a day after brunch. Debby was very professional and responsive to our questions. Compared to other locations in the area, it was quite inexpensive as well.

Haas-Lilienthal was the perfect venue for our May 2024 wedding - grand, beautiful, iconic, while also being charming and homey and utterly San Francisco. We were so happy to discover this amazing place and get to stage our once-in-a-lifetime event there; our guests had a fantastic time exploring the space and it worked great for both the ceremony and the reception. The staff were also incredibly helpful and generous, both beforehand during the planning process and on the day of the event itself - we're utterly grateful for their kindness and flexibility; we got to get to know the space and work with it completely. We're lucky to have had so much support and assistance through every stage. Thank you, Haas-Lilienthal! It was a truly extraordinary experience and there's no other place like it.

As a wedding planning team, we’ve had the pleasure of working with Hayes Mansion across multiple events and service levels, including full planning, partial planning, day-of coordination, and canine coordination. Our experience with Hayes spans weddings, rehearsal dinners and welcome parties, as well as other wedding-related events. Time and time again, the venue has proven to be reliable, flexible, and especially well-suited for Indian and Indian-fusion weddings, which they handle with care and cultural understanding. We worked closely with Mikaela throughout much of the booking and planning process. While there was a period of internal staffing turnover, the Hayes team handled the transition thoughtfully. Jayson, Assistant Director of Events, stepped in seamlessly, promptly answering questions, addressing concerns, and helping move the event confidently across the finish line. Rebekah has also been an incredible partner. As a Sales Coordinator, she is organized, responsive, and truly supportive both during planning and on the wedding day, which makes a huge difference from a planner’s perspective. The service and banquet teams at Hayes are experienced, professional, and dependable. They understand how important a strong banquet captain is and consistently execute major service moments smoothly. We are especially grateful for how everything was set up exactly as planned, while still allowing room for real-time, on-site adjustments. The team follows service plans closely but also knows how to pivot when events naturally evolve, handling each moment with care. Having a hotel on-site is a huge plus.

Had my wedding this weekend at La Foret. Throughout the whole process, John (owner) and Samy (Maitre d) were extremely helpful and accommodating. For the level of service, the delicious food, and the convenience, the prices are extremely reasonable. This venue is both beautiful and convenient. The garden and restaurant can easily accommodate 100+ people. Ample parking. Great location next to a creek, does not need much decorating to make this place wedding-ready. Best part, we did not have to hire a caterer or worry about renting supplies. La Foret staff expertly handled all of this for us. Another plus: there is a large room upstairs for the bridal party to get ready if needed. We called them up so many times leading up to the wedding with questions, and every time they were very patient and flexible with our requests. I had several guests compliment us on our choice of venue. Did I mention the delicious food? Just amazing.

We recently celebrated our daughter Megan's wedding at La Grande Estates in Oakley, CA--and it was nothing short of magical. As parents, it has always been our dream to give our beautiful daughter the wedding of her dreams, and La Grande Estates helped us do exactly that. Set on a stunning piece of land that's been in the same family for three generations, the venue offers a unique charm and elegance that you can feel the moment you arrive. From the very beginning, the team--led by the incredible wedding planner Renee--made us feel confident, cared for, and completely at ease. Renee and her team truly take care of everything. From the linens and tables to the exquisite china and gorgeous décor, every detail was handled with care and precision. Their professionalism and attention to detail meant we didn't have to worry about a single thing--everything ran like clockwork. The food was absolutely amazing, the bartenders were top-notch, and the entire experience felt effortless and full of joy. Under the tent, with beautiful lights twinkling above, the atmosphere was truly magical. Thanks to La Grande Estates, Megan's wedding day was everything she imagined and more--a true dream come true for her and a treasured memory for all of us. We can't recommend them highly enough.

This was the absolute perfect venue for me and my husband. Maple Lawn's "Magnolia Terrace" is where their outdoor weddings take place, and it's gorgeous. Summer in San Rafael has perfect sunny weather, the dark green redwoods and magnolia trees provide a shaded perimeter, and a bright red brick walkway leads up to the white arbor. We also loved the two white fountains, outdoor string lights, and the covered dancefloor. The historic Elk's Lodge on the property has a beautiful bridal suite and an old fashioned wood-paneled gentlemen's room downstairs. It's photo-op central on the rooftop, grand staircase, pool table, and more! I experienced nothing but professionalism and passion in working with Maple Lawn. Sue, the venue liaison, was so easy and FUN to work with, always prompt, and was always available in the planning process. Their bar liaison, Mark, was also an absolute treat to work with. When they didn't have a rosé brut sparkling wine on their bar list, he went and tasted rosés to find an option within budget so we didn't pay anything extra for the special request. It was incredible! Everyone I worked with just seemed to really like one another and be so happy and satisfied with what they do. Did I mention they have AMPLE parking? It was so nice not to have any concerns about my family and friends arriving comfortably. I can't say enough about how perfect this venue was for our special day.
