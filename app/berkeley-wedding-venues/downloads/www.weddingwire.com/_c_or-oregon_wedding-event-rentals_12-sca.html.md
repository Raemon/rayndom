Vessel Rentals provided the rentals and florals for a wedding that I recently attended. From the Art-Nouveau-meets-English-hunting-lodge theme and the mixed metals color scheme down to the decor and the centerpieces, you could tell that every detail was considered and each piece was carefully chosen. Everything was great quality and all tied together beautifully to tell a cohesive visual story. The owner, Olivia, did a wonderful job of understanding the bride's vision and bringing it to life in a way that was beautiful and truly representative of her personality and aesthetic. As an avid antiques collector, I especially appreciated how Olivia wove in vintage pieces - like her use of bronze animal statues as table numbers - alongside more modern choices. The mood for the evening was classic and timeless yet interesting and unexpected, and the design overall was a refreshing departure from other weddings I've been to. And I can't forget to mention the flowers, which were just the icing on the cake... Simple yet sophisticated with a touch of whimsy, they looked stunning arranged in vintage silver champagne buckets. I would highly recommend Olivia and Vessel Rentals for anyone planning a wedding or event who wants a beautiful, high-end look that's truly one-of-a-kind.

We hired XYZoid for our wedding, and they absolutely exceeded our expectations! From start to finish, their team was professional, attentive, and easy to work with. The sound quality was crystal clear throughout the ceremony and reception, ensuring every speech, song, and announcement was heard perfectly. They took the time to understand our needs and executed everything flawlessly. The setup was seamless, and they handled everything with such expertise that we didn’t have to worry about a thing. Our guests even complimented how great the sound was! If you’re looking for a reliable and skilled audio-visual team for your event, I highly recommend XYZoid. They played a huge role in making our special day unforgettable!

Events by Design helped me create the wedding of my dreams within budget. I was nervous when planning my wedding, I had a picture of it in my mind but didn't know how to articulate it. Julie and Tom were awesome at figuring out what I was trying to say. They made my wedding perfect with their decorations and help with suggestions on what products would tie the event together! If I were to do a vow renewal I would definitely pick them to help me make the day amazing! Kaede

We worked with Sherine and the team at Lily & Cane (formerly Vintage Meets Modern) to supply rentals for our outdoor wedding ceremony at the Hoyt Arboretum, including a wedding arch, benches, rugs, and rustic farm tables. The team was so great to work with, especially since we had a tight delivery window in a challenging outdoor location! The furniture quality was top notch and everything looked absolutely gorgeous! Throughout the planning process, Sherine was friendly and professional and provided some great recommendations for how to elevate the look at our ceremony. Thank you so much! We highly recommend Lily & Cane.

We rented a 2-stall mini trailer for our backyard wedding of about 120 people and they were great!! We had a backyard wedding on property that runs on a small septic so we needed backup for our guests. The trailers were very cute, super clean, and I loved the classical music that played when you entered, it was a guest favorite. The drop off and pick up was seamless and they left without a trace! Absolutely had the best prices compared to other restroom rentals I found in the greater Seattle/Tacoma area and they were super easy to schedule with. Highly recommend for anyone needing an affordable restroom rental for their wedding!!

We got some rental furniture and decorations here, and everything was exactly as advertised. Some of the most affordable prices for wedding rentals in the Willamette Valley. They were also really easy to work with and made several additions to our order by email. You get to keep the rentals for the whole weekend, which really helps with DIY prep and setup. The only thing to keep in mind is they’re closed on Sundays, which is kind of weird for a wedding business, so you have to return on a Monday.

Overall, the rentals met our needs, and working with Jonathan at Bend Party Rentals was a smooth and positive experience. We had a great experience with Bend Party Rentals for our wedding. While the rentals weren’t the fanciest out there, the tent and plastic tables were exactly what we needed. The white wooden chairs were beautiful, and I’d imagine their other wooden rentals would be just as lovely, though they weren’t in our price range. The dance floor worked well for our needs, though I can’t fully evaluate it since we had it set up on some pretty rough terrain. Jonathan was fantastic to work with—very responsive and willing to spend time on the phone helping us choose the right kind of tent for our setup, style preferences, and budget. He was also flexible with pricing, as there were a few items we could’ve sourced cheaper elsewhere, and he worked with us on that and helped us understand the reason for the difference (i.e. dance floor with no subflooring), which we appreciated so we didn’t have to coordinate with multiple vendors. The rentals arrived on time, and he was even early, which was a bonus. We opted for the flexible delivery and pick-up option, and although we had to reach out for timing info about a week before the wedding, Jonathan quickly provided the details we needed.

We rented plastic chairs, round tables, and a wooden arch for our wedding. Everything was good except they brought us the wrong color of chairs. We ordered tan and they brought black. I'm not sure if that was on us or them; I was asked to sign for the chairs and since it was the day before the wedding, I just went with it. Otherwise, they showed up on time and set everything out to make it easy for us to set up. I would just recommend making sure you are very clear on your order!

We had our reception at the Central Plaza at the World ForestryCenter and had to provide our own chairs and the chairs had to be picked up the same evening. Unlike their competitors, the Party Pros had the exact chairs we needed, and for a reasonable price delivered the chairs and picked up the chairs after the event. We were very grateful that we found them.
