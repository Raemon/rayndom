DJ R0mlo emceed and DJ’d my daughter’s wedding, and he was outstanding. He is extremely professional and truly listens to what his clients want and need. He brought incredible energy, kept the crowd engaged, and had everyone on the dance floor all night. He’s hilarious, entertaining, and made the entire evening unforgettable. We loved him so much that my youngest daughter has already asked him to DJ her wedding this coming April.

Jill was wonderful to work with! She kept the party going and the dance floor lively all night. She was an awesome MC when needed and was super accommodating to our requests for the reception!

Thank you so much for the incredible experience! Our DJ, his wonderful wife, and the Photo Booth attendant all did an absolutely amazing job at our wedding. We’re huge fans of rock, 70s, 80s, 90s and oldies, and they nailed the music perfectly—it truly made the night unforgettable. I also used their Photo Booth service and absolutely loved it, and so did all of our guests! On top of that, the secret gift they surprised us with at the reception was so thoughtful and something we truly adore. I can’t recommend them enough to anyone looking for an amazing team to make their celebration unforgettable. Thanks again Christopher and Melodee!

Shoresound is the best of the best. My husband and I got married on April 4th in downtown Southport. Shoresound is a local company that knows the area and the vibes through and through. Would use them again and again!

Robby killed it!! Working with Robby and Diana was effortless from the jump. They brought so much fun energy and made planning so simple. Robby totally captured the energy and vibe we wanted and our guests were dancing all night long. We had so much fun and couldn’t be happier!

Larry Martin and his team did a fantastic job at our 09/20/2025 wedding. Larry was always available for any questions or concerns I had throughout the planning process and was so organized as well! Larry made sure to ask all clarifying questions during our final meeting to ensure there was no miscommunication or mix ups during our wedding, and our DJ Craig made sure to reach out the week of to ensure I did not have any questions and to make sure nothing had changed! Our DJ Craig did a fantastic job for our ceremony and reception, he made sure all ceremony music flowed perfectly with no jarring transitions and did a great job at keeping the night flowing! He kept the dance floor alive and slowed it down at the perfect moments. We are so glad we went with A&A Disc Jockey for our special day - they did a fantastic job and truly care about their clients!

We absolutely loved working with Jason at K2 — truly the best choice we could have made for our wedding party! From the very beginning, he was incredibly nice, attentive, and completely focused on making sure our day was exactly what we envisioned. He took the time to understand our style, catered to every request, and was so easy and pleasant to work with throughout the entire planning process. Both Jason and K2’s communication was outstanding — quick responses, helpful suggestions, and a calm, professional attitude that made everything feel effortless. The music was spot-on, the energy was amazing, and they kept the entire evening flowing smoothly, all the while checking in with my husband and I about the progression of things. Our guests had an incredible time, and we’ve received so many compliments on how fun and seamless the night felt. We couldn’t be happier or more grateful! Highly, highly recommend Jason!
