Our Amazing Day at BCC

BCC created the most memorable wedding day for me and my wife. We were amazed at the value compared with other venues in the area. Once we saw the venue in person we were immediately sold. Michelle was an exceptional planner and helped us arrange our vision from day 1. She kept the ceremony, photos, and reception fluid and we are incredibly grateful for her expertise in making the enitre event go off without a hitch. The sunset photos on the green were an extra special touch!

Flexible, reliable, always available!

Michelle was an absolute pleasure. She is responsive, communicative, and extremely reliable. She made us feel like we were the only couple getting married there, and I know she does multiple weddings and events weekly. She answered all of our questions and understood all of our requests. We turned to Berkeley country club after our original venue fell through and they were nothing but understanding, reassuring, and patient with us as we frantically switched dates and plans and vendors. Unfortunately, it rained on our wedding day, but Michelle was so helpful in addressing our concerns and making our wedding day the most memorable day. Even with some timeline hiccups (my own fault), Michelle moved with ease and flexibility, and helped us make our wedding day the best day of our lives. The venue is beautiful on its own with the architecture and location, but honestly, the staff was the highlight of our experience. My wife and I without a doubt recommend the Berkeley country club for any event, but especially for your wedding.

Great venue with great support staff

This venue feels like such a hidden gem. My husband and I visited for the first time when we were looking at wedding venues and immediately knew this was the spot for us. The view at the ceremony location is unbeatable, the indoor reception architecture is classic, and the staff is kind and supportive. We enjoyed working with Michelle, the catering manager, who off the bat showed so much enthusiasm for hosting weddings that it was hard not to get excited too. Between Michelle and our amazing wedding planner ("An Everlasting Moment" if you're looking for a great planner!) and her assistant, my husband and I did not worry about a single logistical thing during our big day. Only love and great appreciation for Berkeley Country Club, and hoping to do some future celebrations there too!

Stunning Views and Great Service

Berkeley Country Club is an absolutely stunning venue. We hosted our wedding there and the views took everyone’s breath away. The ceremony mandap was set up on the deck overlooking the valley and it created the perfect backdrop for a Hindu wedding. The entire team was incredibly welcoming and accommodating. Even the golfers seemed to enjoy the celebration and danced along with our baraat, which made the experience even more fun. They also provided me with a get-ready room, which was incredibly convenient as the bride.  
  
A special thank you to Michelle, who went above and beyond to make the day seamless. She recommended a fantastic florist, Katharina Stuart, who created the most beautiful bouquets for us. Michelle also helped set up the banquet hall for lunch beautifully and worked with us every step of the way. We really appreciated how flexible the club was about allowing an external caterer for lunch. Everything went smoothly from beginning to end and we could not have asked for a more perfect venue or a more supportive team.

2nd Saturday of October 

We absolutely loved having our wedding at The Berkeley Country Club! The views are unreal, the atmosphere is relaxed but elegant, and everything came together perfectly.  
  
A huge shoutout to Michelle, our day-of coordinator! So organized and kind. She went above and beyond for us, even helping fix my wedding dress zipper right before the ceremony! Michelle made sure everything ran smoothly, so we got to just enjoy the day and be fully present.  
  
Our guests were blown away by the setting and how seamless everything felt. We’re so thankful to Michelle and the whole Berkeley Country Club team for making our wedding day so special. Highly recommend this venue!

Best day with gorgeous views

My Husband and I got married at the Berkeley country club last February. Michelle was easy to communicate with and made our day very special. The Venue is gorgeous and the guests couldn’t stop talking about the sunset ceremony. We ended up going with outside catering due to wanting ethnic food, however their menus choices looked delicious and would have gone with in house catering otherwise.

Could Not Recommend More!

We got married in May at Berkeley Country Club and it was everything we hoped for and more! The view and venue sell itself, but Michelle and her wonderful team really made the day so special and memorable.  
  
She worked closely with our vendors to ensure a seamless event - adapting quickly to changes in the timeline day of and unexpected changes. They were super flexible with decor and really allowed us to create a customized experience that matched our vision - even hanging up decor for us the morning of the wedding!   
  
The food really blew us and our guests away and we still get comments from our guests about how good the food and drinks were. They allowed us to craft our own twists on classic cocktails which was a fun touch for us and our guests.   
  
The country club offers great packages we could choose from and helped us find exactly what we were looking for while also accommodating all the guests’ wants and dietary needs.  
  
We couldn’t recommend the country club more!

Amazing Venue!

We had our wedding and reception here in August. The venue's event coordinator, Michelle, was fantastic. When we first toured the venue, she had mentioned that August tends to be windy. We were worried but it turned out to be a gorgeous day - too hot at times perhaps! The venue has sweeping panoramic views of Berkeley, San Francisco, and the whole bay. It's stunning to watch the sunset and see the moon rise. Our guests loved the venue and space.   
The indoor is as beautiful as the exterior- one of many reasons we chose this venue. That way, if weather was bad or there was smoke from fires, we could do our ceremony indoors and it would still be beautiful with a view.   
Michelle was incredible throughout the process - so much so that we did not need to hire a wedding planner. She was easy to communicate with, fun, knowledgable, and super helpful day of. Her entire staff was stellar. Highly recommend.

Our amazing day

We got married one month ago at the Berkeley Country Club, and had a fantastic experience in the leadup to as well as on our big day.  
  
Michelle, our event coordinator, provided so much help and top class service (hats off to Michelle!). The venue took care of the ceremony, table placings, food and beverage, and day-of coordination with all of our vendors... All for a really reasonable price.  
  
The ceremony venue is a gorgeous overlook of the entire San Francisco bay. We caught really good weather on our wedding day (September 7) and the visibility was amazing. They setup ample chairs for our guests and allowed us to add audio along with a homemade arbor.  
  
The food was great and drew rave reviews from our guests - we plated their short rib, frenched chicken and veggie ravioli. The staff was very attentive and made sure everyone had what they needed. Michelle gave us space to enjoy the celebrations but jumped in at the right times to guide us places for pictures in coordination with our photography team.  
  
All in all we had an absolute blast in no small part due to the Berkeley Country Club and its wonderful staff. I encourage all couples to check them out for their wedding days and hope I get an invite!

June Wedding 

There are no words to express how much Michelle made my wedding the most incredible day. She was very kind in explaining the process of the wedding like the food tasting, details on the tables, and setting up decorations. She was patient when my husband and I had to think about a few ideas. She remembered every detail I wanted on the day of the wedding. She even helped me with my dress when it wouldn’t button up. The staff was also very kind and gave their congratulations to us. Country is such a beautiful place. Thanks again!
