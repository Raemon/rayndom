Five stars!

Words cannot describe how amazing our wedding at MacArthur Place was. Our original wedding venue cancelled on us 2 months before the big day so I reached out to MacArthur on a whim to see if they would be able to host our event. Laura and Michelle were incredible to work with and extremely responsive throughout the entire process. Due to COVID, we were forced to cut down our guest list substantially but utilized their "Inner Circle" wedding package which came with so many amazing perks and amenities. The property is absolutely stunning, the staff is top notch, the food is to die for and our 22-guest wedding went off without a hitch. I cannot say enough good things about our experience with this venue and the team. Planning a wedding through a pandemic made it difficult to feel like a real bride at times but MacArthur helped make our wedding dreams a reality and made the whole experience feel as normal and special as possible despite some of the restrictions. If you are considering a wedding in Sonoma, look no further. This is THE place.

We got engaged while staying at MacArthur Place on vacation so it was naturally on our short list of possible venues. From my first phone call with Linda, their event coordinator, every interaction we had with her and her staff was wonderful. Linda was quick to respond, was completely on top of things, and really went the extra mile to ensure that we were going to have the wedding we wanted. She was a dream to work with every step of the way.  
  
The hotel itself was perfect for our needs. Everything about the place is beautiful and inviting. The different gardens that cover the grounds provided our photographer with a variety of different backdrops to use when taking pictures. The Veranda Garden is the perfect spot for an outdoor ceremony. We used one of the private rooms off of their restaurant for the reception, so it was just a two minute stroll from the ceremony to dinner. All of our guests raved about the food (I've never had a Chicken Marsala as good as the one they served that night). And the staff was very friendly and attentive.   
  
As for the cost, it wasn't cheap, but it was a lot cheaper than the other venues that we looked at in the Sonoma area. Part of it is that they are equipped to do the catering and set up themselves, so you don't have to bother with renting chairs and tables or dealing with separate catering fees. We feel that the experience we had was well worth the price.   
  
A wedding is a very personal thing. We all have our own hopes and dreams that we bring with us to that day. For us, MacArthur Place was the absolute right - or dare I say perfect - venue. We can't wait to go back next year to celebrate our anniversary.

I cannot stress enough how wonderful this place is and how fabulous the staff is!!! Linda was a breeze to work with, and dealth with my over organization like she had not a care in the world. The staff is hospitable, friendly and soooo professional. Everyone was so polite and made sure we had not a worry during the whole day. David kept the ceremony on track, kept the time table without being intrusive, and made sure that our every need was looked after. The grounds were beautiful, and everywhere we went, staff made sure that we we had everything that we could dream of. The accomodations in the Spa Suite were above and beyond! Talk about clean and beautiful!! It was a beautiful place to spend our first night as a married couple, and the next morning, it was so lovely to have the staff congratulating us, and making sure that we had a pleasant stay. We will be back year after year, and hope to stay there for our babymoon too!!

The staff at MacArthur Inn is most accommadating, hard working, kind people I have every worked with. They treated us with great respect, and were 100% about making us and our guests happy. The food was amazing, the Chef is wonderful, and cooked to my food allergies. Linda is on top of every little detail, and works with you daily on any and every need. Steve worked with us day of and was so attentive, payed special attention to detail, and was there to do anything we requested! I recommend MacArthur Inn, to anyone who wants a perfect wedding!!!

MacArthur Place was such a beautiful place to stay for the weekend of my wedding. My bridesmaids and I stayed in one of the few larger rooms with two queen beds and it was a perfect place to spend the night on the eve of my wedding and the perfect place to get ready together before the ceremony! My hairstylist was able to use the large vanity to do all our hair and makeup with plenty of room for everyone else to mingle. Our room was beautiful and the continental breakfast was great as well. For our wedding night my husband and I stayed in a cottage and it was to die for! Thank you MacArthur for helping make our wedding weekend a little bit greater!

We had our rehearsal dinner at MacArthur Place and could not have asked for a more qualified planner to organize this event. Living in Pennsylvania, all of the planning was done over the telephone and computer, and everything was just wonderful. Nothing was too much trouble and all of my requests were addressed. The food was delicious, the service were excellent, and the ambiance of the inn was lovely. It was a wonderful evening for everyone.

The day before my wedding, I took my mom and mother-in-law to MacArthur's Place for a facial and a massage to help us relax and get pampered before the big day. The staff were extremely nice and professional about booking 3 of us together and the spa was amazingly well designed and decorated. It's located next to the pool garden with a nice little gift shop inside. There's a nice changing/shower locker room with robes and amenities. We thoroughly enjoyed our facials and massages packages, which were the best values I found in the whole town of Sonoma! I would recommend this place for future visitors looking to relax and get pampered :)

Beautiful Property, Excellent Service

The property was stunning and the service was terrific! We don't typically have high expectations for food at weddings, but MacArthur Place knocked it out of the park - absolutely delicious. Overall, it was absolutely perfect. There were a few instances of miscommunication with catering throughout the planning process, but this would not deter us from recommending.

MacArthur Place was the pefect choice for our elopement. We could not have asked for a more beautiful location or better service. The property & rooms are incredible. Linda & the rest of the staff were great. I felt at ease in planning our special day from out of state. Her recommendations on flowers, officiate, & other services were right on. We highly recommend MacArthur Place to anyone for a ceremony or a great place to stay in Sonoma. We plan on coming back for anniversaries in the future.
