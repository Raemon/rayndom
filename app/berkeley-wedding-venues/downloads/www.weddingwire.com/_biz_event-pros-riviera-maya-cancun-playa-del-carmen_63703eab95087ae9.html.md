Tatiana and her company went above and beyond to make our wedding day a success. She was openly available all the time, and always offered to assist with things for our wedding, as well as help in other areas by recommending other vendors in Mexico that could be of assistance to us. We had a very specific music list (over 200 songs that we sent) of all different genres to accommodate our wedding guests and different cultures, and they followed it to the T! The photo booth, the dance floor, the giant letters, the DJ, the MC. Everything was excellent and beautiful! We’re so happy with the services we received and highly recommend them!
