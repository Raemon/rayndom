Misselwood is AMAZING!! You can't beat the sweeping ocean views, which made for a stunning backdrop for our ceremony. Our guests were absolutely blown away.

Get married at Misselwood!

Growing up in Hanson getting married here just felt right. From middle school dances, swimming in cranberry cove and fishing with friends- getting married here really brought life full circle for me. Renee was very responsive and they gave us a list of preferred vendors - we went with our own because we were determined to but they had great recommendations! We had an afternoon wedding and rented the campground for our after party so the party lasted all day - it was the event of a lifetime and our friends are still giving compliments and asking how to get in touch with the venue themselves! If you’re looking for a laid back, gorgeous wedding- this is the spot for you! We had a fall wedding and the venue really spoke for itself!

We had our wedding at Catamount in July of 2023. We absolutely loved this large, open and inviting event space. We were able to decorate it completely to our own standards and the venue staff went above and beyond by opening it early so we ensure everything was set up ahead of the event, which significantly reduced the stress levels. The kitchen was also at our disposal and our caterer loved the space and the advance use to prep things. Everyone from the event coordinator (Stephanie) to the housekeeping staff and the bartenders were amazing, helpful, friendly and efficient. The ability to have access to both indoor and outdoor spaces made it the perfect compromise on a hot summer day and the outdoor games and fire pits were a huge hit! Can’t recommend this venue highly enough - definitely go check it out!

Our wedding went so smoothly at Indian Ranch! The ceremony outside by the lake was beautiful, and I loved how big the dance floor was inside. All the staff were really on top of it, especially our coordinator, Tammy. They made sure that everything went super smoothly, and even thought of things like bringing us drinks and apps while we were outside taking photos! We also got to take a photo on the Indian Ranch stage and the Indian Princess, so that was awesome! Definitely recommend having a wedding here. The rennovations they made were excellent. And the sound system is already set up so the DJ didn't have to bring any speaker equipment.

I had not been to NEBG prior to looking for a wedding venue. The venue is beautiful and has so much to offer. We live just over an hour away and have visited many times in the last year to enjoy the gardens and events. For our small wedding ceremony, we appreciated the reasonable pricing and flexible options (we expected to have a smaller guest count but weren’t yet certain exactly what we wanted that to look like when we booked so it was great to know we had options). What sets NEBG apart for weddings, though, is its staff. They were responsive, knowledgeable, and accommodating throughout the process and on the day. They always followed through such that our expectations were met and exceeded every step of the way. I cannot recommend NEBG and its staff highly enough!

The staff at Courageous was helpful in helping us execute all of the logistics of our wedding day! We have been coming here for years for various sailing events and did not want to have our special take place anywhere else as this location means so much to us! The tent space is large to accommodate a large guest count and the outdoor area at the end of the pier was spruced up with some greenery to make it feel more intimate and casual with lawn games. The staff helped coordinate with all of our vendors and clearly showed that they know how to handle a full scale event seamlessly! Thank you Courageous!
