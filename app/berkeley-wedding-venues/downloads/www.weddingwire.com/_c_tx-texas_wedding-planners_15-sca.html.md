Precious is seriously the best! Our wedding was absolutely perfect & there is no way we could have pulled off such an amazing wedding without her. She is very knowledgeable and was always on top of everything. She’s there for you every step of the way and is the best support system to lean on throughout the whole process. Every request was granted with a smile & nothing was overlooked or fell through the cracks. We were able to enjoy a stress free wedding day all thanks to her. By the end of it, Precious was like family to us and we couldn’t thank her enough for helping make our day so special. She is a joy to work with and I recommend her to anyone and everyone!

Valerie Miller Events is truly the best in Texas! Our daughters May 17, 2025 wedding was amazing! Valerie found the perfect venue at the perfect price for us. Her experience and years in the business provided us with vendors who were attentive, professional & dependable, which made the planning process with Valerie worry free and fun. I must add the flowers were gorgeous! Don't bother shopping around, Valerie does it all in style within your budget.

Pearl Events and my planner, Madison, completely outdid themselves! Our wedding was everything we wanted and more. Maddy listened to all of our wants/needs, was incredibly patient, professional, kind, ORGANIZED, and handled everything seamlessly. I was never stressed and Maddy had an answer to every question, big or small. Pearl Events has so many vendors that they vet and recommend that were all amazing. There was no idea that they couldn't achieve and Maddy worked within our budget to deliver over the top results. I couldn't recommend Pearl Events and Madison more!!

I found Jennifer Ashford of Altar Ego Wedding through The Knot. I interviewed several people before deciding to go with Jennifer, and it was the second-best decision I've ever made (the first was saying yes to my now-husband). Jennifer is the perfect amount of assertive and decisive. I never felt overwhelmed because I knew Jen was taking care of everything. My wedding was more perfect than I could have ever hoped for. Her industry know-how and professional but personable demeanor made everything feel easy. She knew exactly what to do all the time, and I had complete faith in her to be a good steward of my wedding. Our wedding was in October 2025, and since then, I have attended a few more. I know I’m completely biased, but having a good wedding planner can completely set you apart. The pacing of my wedding was immaculate. There were no awkward lulls; everything went smoothly on the day of. If anything, the best reason to have a wedding planner is to have someone on your team who knows the industry intimately. Every time I mentioned Jen to a vendor, they had nothing but positive things to say about her, which truly demonstrates how seriously Jen takes these industry connections. ​ Everyone I've talked to and everyone my parents have talked to about my wedding has said that my wedding was one of the nicest weddings they’ve ever been to, and I don’t think they are just blowing smoke. I’m so glad I chose Altar Ego Weddings and would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a wedding planner!

We were the caterers for the Lauren and Josh Wedding at Sisterdale Dance Hall. Jenna was the wedding planner and a joy to work with. I highly recommend her to brides in search of a coordinator to help with the details of their wedding planning.

We hired Barbara's Brides as a day-of-coordinator for our August 2020 wedding, which was ultimately moved to May 2021 because of the pandemic, after our venue coordinator recommended her. Barbara is well-established in the Austin wedding community. I had no doubt that she and her team could pull off anything with their experience and connections. Because of this, I was relieved that I didn’t have to worry about missing details or checking things off my list because I knew Barbara would make sure things were addressed. Barbara provided a preferred list of vendors early in the process, which was super helpful in reviewing and deciding on our many options, though many of our vendors were not on her list. She preemptively checked on us during the pandemic, moved our date with no issues, shared a wedding checklist, shared a wedding timeline with me and the vendors in advance of the big day, and after the wedding, she ensured I received a reimbursement for services not rendered by one of the vendors. She was especially kind when she gave us a lovely Driskill cookbook, which we decided to use as our wedding guestbook. Barbara's associate Gerad ran the day-of coordination and did a fabulous job. There were a few small details that I would have changed, but in the grand scheme they didn't matter, and certainly without Barbara and Gerad, our wedding wouldn’t have turned out so great. I am very grateful to have found such a professional and established team that pulled together all the major details while allowing me to enjoy and soak in the day.

I cannot say enough about Donna and Sierra! They were absolutely amazing to work with and made the entire wedding planning such a breeze (seriously, a no stress wedding). They were always quick to respond to emails, questions. The day of our wedding, they took care of EVERYTHING from set-up to clean-up while I laid back (aha) and got pampered by my HAMU crew! Everything was perfect and as far as I know, it went perfectly with nothing going wrong!

I highly recommend Affordable & Affluent Affairs for any special event that you are planning. Throughout the entire wedding planning process, CJ was always available to me for questions/concerns or just general bride freak-out moments. I truly do not think my wedding would have gone as smoothly as it did without her and her associates assistance. They were there the whole day making sure the vendors were where they needed to be and at the right time as well as making sure the bridal party was in the right place at the right time. I can not thank AAA enough for everything they helped me with for my wedding :)

I recently had the pleasure of working with Stephanie, a highly skilled wedding planner, who orchestrated not one, but three remarkable weddings for my children within a span of just 18 months. With two of the (larger) weddings taking place in Scottsdale, Arizona—one at the stunning Sanctuary and the other at the Four Seasons—and the third (smaller) in Asheville, North Carolina, held at a private residence, Stephanie displayed an extraordinary ability to adapt and cater to the unique styles and preferences of each couple. From the initial planning stages to the grand finale, Stephanie's expertise shone through. Her meticulous attention to detail and thorough understanding of our vision made all the difference in creating unforgettable wedding experiences. What impressed me the most was her steadfast commitment to ensuring that every aspect of the events reflected the personalities and desires of the couples. On the day of each wedding, Stephanie's presence was invaluable. She skillfully managed the entire affair, meticulously coordinating all the moving parts to ensure a seamless flow. Her unwavering dedication to maintaining the timeline ensured that the day unfolded precisely as we envisioned, allowing us to savor every moment without worrying about logistics. Stephanie's ability to handle the diverse challenges that arose during the planning process and on the day itself was remarkable. Her calm demeanor and problem-solving skills instilled confidence in everyone involved, making the entire experience stress-free and enjoyable for all. Moreover, Stephanie's professionalism extended beyond her excellent organizational skills. She was an exceptional communicator, promptly addressing any concerns or questions that arose throughout the process. Her warm and approachable nature made her a joy to work with, fostering a collaborative atmosphere that facilitated open dialogue and creative brainstorming. I wholeheartedly recommend Stephanie as a wedding planner of the highest caliber. Her ability to curate unforgettable weddings, adapt to various styles, and flawlessly execute every detail sets her apart from the rest. Thanks to her expertise and dedication, my children's weddings were nothing short of extraordinary, leaving cherished memories that will last a lifetime. If you're seeking an exceptional wedding planner who will go above and beyond to create your dream celebration, Stephanie is the one to trust!
