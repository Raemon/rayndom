Custom Coffee Experiences but cafe quality

I’ve been to several of their pop ups whether it’s literally in a middle of a glass field or as a vendor popping up and Estelle and her team are incredibly kind/inviting but also produce some of the best drinks I’ve ever had with their house-made syrups you’re not getting Tourani sugar cups, you’re getting thought out cafe-grade drinks that will have you seeking out their pop ups throughout the city!

LOVED everything about Hawa

I recently attended an event hosted by Hawa Hospitality and was blown away by the entire experience. Their drinks were crafted to perfection, featuring house-made syrups that elevated every sip with unique, specialty coffee flavors. The professional baristas handled everything with skill and enthusiasm, making it feel like a true artisanal treat.  
  
The decor stood out as beautifully elegant, with thoughtful touches that created a sophisticated yet cozy vibe perfect for mingling.  
  
What truly set Hawa Hospitality apart was their mission rooted in mental health awareness, transforming a standard event into something warm and inviting rather than purely transactional. This genuine care made guests feel valued and connected. I’d highly recommend them for any gathering—they deliver excellence on every level.
