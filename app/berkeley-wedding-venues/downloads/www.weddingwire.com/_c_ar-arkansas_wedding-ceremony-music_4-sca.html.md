Shumann attended our wedding/elopement ceremony at Anthony Chapel in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He played so beautifully I wish it would have never ended. He learned every song we chose and played anything we requested. It really made the whole experience magical. I would recommend him to anyone looking for a pianist. It wouldn't have been the same without him!

Rivers did a fantastic job. We hired him for the ceremony only. Very communicative leading up to the event. We asked him to do one song not on his list (a Lord of the Rings theme) and he did a great arrangement of it!
