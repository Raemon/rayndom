Would not recommend

I think this is the first poor review I've written. I loved my wedding but it was not easy to deal with Signia by Hilton. Caveat: we had an Indian wedding, and with that comes some unique circumstances (multiple events across several days, large families, baraat ceremony outdoors, etc). First, it was not easy to get rooms together, and was luck of the draw, which made visiting family or planning between rooms difficult. Second, bar service was slow at our events with certain bartenders randomly refusing to poor shots in the middle of our events. Finally, my biggest frustration was the value: we spent a lot of money to have our event here and got minimal to no flexibility and poor transparency. At one point, the hotel threatened us to not have our last event because there was an outstanding balance from the night before, and we were expected to settle it between events. Despite making payments and active communication, there was no extension of good faith and the hotel tries to money grab at every corner (i.e. adding breakfast for guests upwards of $20 per bagel).
