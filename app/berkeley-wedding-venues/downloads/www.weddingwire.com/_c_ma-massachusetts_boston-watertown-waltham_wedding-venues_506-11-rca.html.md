We had checked several venues in our area and we landed on the Cape Club of Sharon as one of the venues. We chose them and could not have been happier with our choice. From the moment we contacted them to arrange a "look-see", all the way to the days before the reception, the day and night of the reception, and even the day after the reception (to pick up all our supplies), they were absolutely phenomenal. Every guest gave rave reviews. Everything was top-shelf, from the actual reception and cocktail hour space, outside view of the golf grounds, food, service, and staff. Their Bridal Suite is absolutely amazing - 2 spacious rooms, plus a hair/makeup space, almost like at a beauty salon. Not only was everything top quality, but the staff could not have been more accommodating and flexible. Also, they were the best value - although they are top-notch for food, beverages, venue and service, they are one of the least expensive venues in the area. I cannot recommend The Cape Club of Sharon enough, that's how excellent everything was.

The staff at the Harding Allen Estate are AMAZING! Professional, friendly, accommodating. Both the outdoor space and inside the Estate are beautiful. Right from our tour, we knew we had found our venue. Jasmine was responsive from the beginning and as our date neared she helped make sure everything was taken care of. The day ran so smoothly, and all of the staff were so nice. I loved that we could plan on having the wedding ceremony outdoors and if the weather failed us last minute, they'd be able to move us inside no problem. No stress needed! I cannot recommend them enough!!

Our wedding at the Boston Harbor Hotel was an absolute dream! From our very first meeting, Amanda made us feel incredibly welcomed, understood, and cared for. She took the time to listen to our vision and went above and beyond to make it a reality. Her expertise and warmth made the entire planning process enjoyable and stress-free. The day of the wedding, the staff was outstanding—attentive, professional, and genuinely invested in making our day perfect. Every detail was executed flawlessly, from the stunning venue setup to the exceptional food, which all of our guests are still raving about. The Boston Harbor Hotel team created a magical experience that we will cherish forever. If you're looking for a wedding venue with impeccable service, delicious cuisine, and a dedicated team, this is the place to be!

From the moment we met with Kelsey Wilkinson in August 2021 we knew no other venue would do for our special day. Kelsey made the entire process enjoyable & stress free. She was always so calm & reassuring that I had zero worries/concerns about the venue delivering what they said they would. Kelsey was always on top of every detail & incredibly responsive. On the day of my husband & I decided to attend the cocktail hour & Carol made sure that everytime she came out with hors d'oeuvres she made a beeline to me to assure I ate. When it was time for dinner Reggie not only remembered us from our tasting months prior but was super attentive to us making sure we were happy with our meal & our cups were never empty. Chef was so kind to remember my FIL's weird obsession with needing tortillas with every meal & made some for him! The entire staff at Boston Park Plaza were such a pleasure to work with & made our wedding day so special. It was absolutely perfect & happened without any snags (still can't believe it went so well). All of our guests were impressed & very happy. Thank you!!!

We hosted our rehearsal dinner at The Hampshire House the Friday before our wedding, and it was absolutely perfect. The food was incredible, we chose the carving stations with turkey and salmon, and everyone raved about it.The quality and presentation were outstanding. The atmosphere was exactly what we wanted. The historic styling of the space created such a warm, elegant vibe, and guests couldn’t stop commenting on how beautiful the room was. After dinner, we opened things up for a welcome party with 120ish guests. The space fit everyone comfortably, it never felt crowded or overwhelming (which we were worried about). It was lively without being too loud, and bartenders kept lines short so no one ever waited long for a drink. The staff on the day was friendly, professional, and made everything run smoothly. During planning, we worked with Sydney, who was amazing. She made the entire process stress-free and painless, and was super fun to work with. She toured both our parents around the venue on separate occasions and made everyone feel excited and well-taken care of. We had our guests stay at the Park Plaza, hosted our rehearsal dinner and welcome drinks at The Hampshire House and then our wedding nearby at The Tower. It was a perfect Boston wedding and great for out of town guests if you are wanting to showcase Boston and the historic and beautiful architecture. Many of our guests were from Chicago and also loved seeing the Cheers Bar underneath. Our event was great and we would highly recommend Sydney and the Hampshire House for any wedding event.

I can't begin to describe what an amazing wedding we had at The Cut. From getting ready in the bridal suites and making our debut off the elevator backstage (what!?) it was picture perfect start to finish. The sound and lighting for our DJ was indescribable and our guests can't stop saying it was the best party they've ever been to - we danced all night and added the after party to go until 1AM! The interior of the venue has to be seen to be believed! Stop looking - seriously!

We held our wedding in September 2025 at the Langham and for anyone contemplating about where to host their wedding, choose The Langham. There are multiple rooms that the ceremony, cocktail hour, and the reception can be held and they are all beautiful and spacious. We toured many venues that were just too small because of it being built decades ago and Boston is well Boston. But, The Langham is a historic building that is pristine and gorgeous from the recent renovation. The planning team is incredible, we got to work with Rosie, Tina, and Olivia and they are the true dream team. They let us know that they only take one event per night so there is no chance that they are divided in their attention. They set up a planning tool for us, emailed us at least every few weeks in the year we planned, actively scheduled calls to ask us questions, and really pulled off the vision for our wedding so seamlessly. During the wedding planning, we had many ups and downs but the venue never stressed us out once. They are kind, culturally respectful, and truly invested in the work they do. Overall, the team at the Langham went above and beyond to set up mirrors for us as the girls got ready, surprised us with embroidered robes and desserts, and made us feel like superstars for our weekend. The food deserves its own review. We had any wedding guests who have been going to weddings for decades but they have said that the food was the best they had. The Michelin Keys that The Langham holds are no joke. The filet mignons were cooked to perfection, being offered two types of warm rolls were such a nice touch, and our many guests with dietary restrictions mentioned they had never been this accommodated for. As two foodies, we were truly so excited to feed our guests from the first bite we had at our tasting in June. Kudos to the chef! Lastly, we had read reviews about weddings at The Langham and they exceeded expectations. Our vendors mentioned that they had such smooth experiences, our guests loved the rooms they stayed in, and the location is perfect for any out-of-towners. Thank you to The Langham for our perfect wedding!

I had the privilege of hosting my wedding at the Umass Club in June and I was truly blown away! It was the best night of my and my husband's life and our guests can't stop raving about the venue, the food, the views, all of it! Working with Paige was an absolute dream and she made the process so incredibly seamless with her responsiveness, advice, feedback, etc. If you have the chance to look at this venue for your dream Boston wedding, I HIGHLY recommend!

##  Boston Wedding Venues for You 

Boston is a small metropolis steeped in American History. From the earliest days of the colonies to the American Revolution and all the way to modern day, Boston has been the quintessential east coast city. More than its history, Boston is a stunning locale for all kinds of weddings. Here are a few things to think about when considering a wedding venue in Boston. 

Popular Wedding Venues in Boston & Prices 

At only about 90 square miles, Boston is by no means America's largest city. But don't let the size fool you, there are plenty of beautiful and unique wedding locations for you and your fiancé(e) to say "I do". The most popular wedding venues in Boston include: mansions, estates, and hotels. 

It's pretty safe to say that the people of Boston love their city's history, if their choices in wedding venues is anything to go by. If you and your fiancé(e) are looking for that classical architecture and timeless beauty, any of Boston's mansion or estate ceremony & reception venues are sure to please. 

Hotels are great options for those couples expecting a large number of out-of-town guests. These wedding locations tend to be more modern and allow for a great amount of personal customization in the space, since many of the rooms used for hosting weddings can be used for other events as well. 

If you want to combine classic and modern, considering booking a Inn for your wedding venue. This way guests can come for the whole weekend (or holiday) to celebrate with you and your fiancé(e). 

Some uncommon and unique venues include: waterfront venues, an aquarium, cruise ships, a baseball stadium, and museums. If you're looking for a non-traditional wedding venue, these are just a few that will surely get your guests talking. 

As far as pricing is concerned, the average cost for a wedding in Boston is around $36,621, which is about $7,600 above the national average. Don't worry if you're budget isn't actually like the averages, they are just averages and every couple's budget is as special as their wedding! 

##  Travel & Hotel Accommodations 

For out-of-town guests, there are a few travel options into the city. For guests that are close enough to drive, or just don't like flying, I-95 is probably going to be the best way to reach your wedding venue/ wedding venues. It runs the length of the east coast from Florida to Maine. Guests coming from Vermont of New Hampshire may have a quicker drive taking Interstates 89 or 93. The drive from northern states to downtown Boston wedding venues can be anywhere from 3 to 5 hours. 

Out-of-town guests that are flying in for your wedding should fly into Boston's only airport, Boston Logan International. Once guests' flights arrive, the travel to the wedding venues in the center of the city should take 10-15 minutes depending on traffic. 

Considering your wedding venue may not be a hotel or Inn, out-of-town guests will need a place to stay for the duration of the festivities. And the average price for a night in Boston is about $130. Finding affordable rooms close to your wedding location alone can be a challenge. We suggest taking a look at this awesome [wedding hotel block](https://hotelblocks.weddingwire.com "Wedding Hotel Block") service. Representatives will do all the hard work of finding rooms, all you have to do is pick which option works best for you and your guests. Then just pass along the hotel information. It's that easy! 

##  Weather Considerations 

Weather can be a huge factor in deciding on a wedding venue, here are just a couple of things to think about before booking a Boston wedding venue. Boston's humid continental climate gives the area hot humid summers and no dry season. 

Fun fact: Boston is one of the wettest cities in the United States. While most of the rain in the summer comes from thunderstorms, throughout the rest of the year, it will likely rain in Boston one out of every three days. So toss out that old myth that rain on your wedding day is bad luck! 

The warm season in Boston lasts from the beginning of June to the middle of September with daily average high temperatures above 73 degrees. If you and your fiancé(e) plan on booking an outdoor wedding venue during the summer, be prepared for the heat. Boston is located north enough that temperatures seldom rise over 90 degrees, but it will still be humid. Make sure guests have a way to stay cool and hydrated. Misting tents and fans are a great options for keeping guests comfortable. Since summer thunderstorms can be expected, talk to your wedding venue about a backup space for your ceremony or reception (if either are outdoor) as well as their policies regarding inclement weather. 

The cold season in Boston lasts from the beginning of December to the middle of March with daily high temperatures averaging below 45 degrees. A winter wedding is Boston is gonna be cold. Snow can also be expected from the middle of November to the beginning of April. It'll once again be important to find out everything your wedding venue will do in the case of inclement weather. If you and your fiancé(e) want to do anything outside in the cold, make sure guests and wedding party members are dressed appropriately and consider renting a tent and heaters, if they are not provided by the wedding venue. 

When you're ready to start your search for Boston wedding venues, WeddingWire has everything you need to make the process simple and fun.
