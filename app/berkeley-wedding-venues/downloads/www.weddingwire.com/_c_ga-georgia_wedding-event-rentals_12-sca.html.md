I cannot recommend Maison Des Rêve enough! Planning a birthday for a 15-year-old can be overwhelming, but Gisselle made the entire process seamless. From the initial concept to the final cleanup, they handled everything. I actually got to enjoy my child’s party and mingle with guests instead of running around stressing over details. If you want a magical day without the headache, hire them immediately!

I met Luccette and her team from a baby shower she had decorated. It was downright impressive watching Luccette and her husband haul huge backdrops through a crowded venue. She went straight to work and was extremely thorough. She didn't leave things as is for convenience; she will fix it until it's perfect. I reached out to her to decorate for a wedding reception. She kept me updated even when she was out of the country. We met up as many times as it took. She discussed her ideas with us and we shared our thoughts with her. Luccette was very professional and addressed all feedback. She was also very easy to work with and accommodated us more than we could have asked for. I had so much fun working with Luccette!!

We used Elite Events for our wedding in Savannah, GA and I cannot express how amazing the experience was. Marissa was our wedding coordinator with Elite and she is so professional, she is responsive and she handles everything so well on the day of wedding. I was completely stress free and so was my family (which was one of the most important things). She suggested, helped and above and beyond, she is SO knowledgeable. We also used Elite Events for the dance floors, chairs, tables, everything and I would do it again! They make everything SO EASY!!! My wedding day was beyond my expectations with them, and it was unpredictable weather in October so that speaks volumes on them! Thank you again & please give them a call for a perfect wedding day!

Everything looked wonderful for our event - I would recommend using them for your event! We rented high tops and cloths, white folding chairs. And the flowers they created for us were beautiful!

We needed a couple of patio heaters, pipe and drape, speakers and a mic, and a sweetheart table and UPR delivered! It was exactly what we needed and very fairly priced!

Having a partnership with our venue manager, our experience with BBJ Linens was great. We were able to pivot last-minute on a few design changes and quantities that BBJ graciously accommodated. Final counts were 55 gold twill napkins and two 120RD white table cloths. Linens were delivered clean to the venue and mailed back by the venue. Couldn't have asked for anything more.
