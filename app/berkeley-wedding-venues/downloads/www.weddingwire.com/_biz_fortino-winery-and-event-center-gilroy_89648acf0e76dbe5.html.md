Great Experience!

We found Fortino Winery after an extensive search for venues in the Bay Area. I wanted to get married in the redwoods but due to a family member’s health condition, elevation became a challenge which limited the venues significantly. We decided to check Fortino Winery out since they mentioned on their website that their ceremony area had redwoods. We met with Becca in September of 2021 and she gave us a tour of the facility and a basic rundown on how things would work if we booked them. We were impressed not only by the size of the event center but also how beautiful it was. We also loved that the caterer was in house, which really saved us stress in trying to find a caterer. Another huge aspect of why we went with Fortino Winery was that a day-of event coordinator is included in the cost of the venue! For an extra fee, they even decorated the entire venue for us, which allowed us to save money on a wedding planner and still have our bridal party have a relaxing morning with out errands and chores to do the day of. We were a little concerned when we were notified that the event coordinator we had been working with, Becca, relocated to Southern California. The new event coordinator, Esther, did a great job picking up where Becca left off. She was in contact with us regularly, and was diligent answering my incessant emails. She went out of her way to accommodate our requests like finding coupe glasses for our champagne toast. She was very transparent about the amount of alcohol we would need and cautioned us against ordering an additional keg, which was great advice! The morning of the wedding, Esther was constantly checking in on the bridal party, making sure we had everything we needed. The decorations came out incredible with only a few small signs not making it out, which was no big deal. Additionally, the staff was incredibly helpful and accommodating. Esther even served my husband and I dinner personally, so we would not have to wait in the buffet line. They even did all the clean up! We can not recommend Fortino Winery enough! If you want a stress-free wedding (as much as possible) and have a beautiful venue, you can’t go wrong with Fortino!

Fortino Winery was great for our daughter's wedding

We had our daughter’s wedding at Fortino Winery last February before the world closed and it was a perfect day! Bree and the rest of the staff were excellent and made the day run so smoothly. She is professional and never got ruffled and made sure the entire day stayed on schedule. Gino Fortino did the food and it was amazing! Our guests went on and on about it. All in all, the day couldn’t have gone better. I highly recommend them!

There have been 17 days since we had our amazing wedding. Everyone has being complimenting our choice in venue and I felt it was time to share. This venue is wonderful. The ceremony location out by the trees was just perfect and looked awesome in photos. It was pretty windy on rehearsal night and I was a little worried but all in all the wind was much tamer on our wedding day.   
  
Debbi, the venue coordinator knows her venue and staff well. She's on top of her stuff and had warned us about the wind so it wasn't a total surprise. She's a go getter and has to be to wrangle a whole wedding party. She at first comes off a bit tough but really she has to be to get stuff and people in the right places. Everyone had a great time and Debbi kept us on track. Honestly we had a difficult group who didn't listen well so she wrangled us well.   
  
There are lots of awesome photo op locations even though it's a relatively small vineyard (Which is part of what we loved about it). We loved the very personal feel of the space. It's really charming. The bridal suite is a good space with a shower and bathroom but could be even better with some updated window coverings and furniture. But really we were in there for such a small amount of time it wasn't a big thing.  
  
The food was amazing. We did the family style meal and have not stopped hearing about how delish the chicken parmesan was. Also our guests loved the almond champaign. We were able to choose the beer that was served and again Debbi knows her stuff we ordered the perfect amount of wine and beer thanks to her help.   
  
The venue was just stunning and we really were able to use very little decorations which was awesome. Can't wait to visit it again and day dream about our amazing day. It was just perfect. I wouldn't have changed a thing.

My Husband and I were very excited to choose Fortino Winery because of many reasons. To list a few we chose Fortino because of how friendly the staff is when we've been wine tasting, how beautiful the setting was for our ceremony and reception, and how Awesome Debbie Sanchez is! The winery and Debbie took great care of us. Debbie answered all of my questions I had up until it was time for our wedding and she is extremely knowledgeable because of how long she has been doing weddings. Debbie helped to make our day so special and made sure everything went off without a hitch. We are so lucky to have chosen such an amazingly special place to get married and I would recommend to anyone to check out Fortino Winery for your possible venue and work with Debbie Sanchez. Debbie Josh and I cannot thank you enough with how amzing you are! Thank you so so much!

When my wife and I initially chose Fortino, it was due to the fact that it offered the best value proposition and was close to my wife's family in Gilroy. It ended up being the best decision we made during the entire wedding planning process. Fortino's event coordinator, Debbi Sanchez, is truly incredible and she is the primary reason why Fortino is such a great place to host a wedding. She stayed in contact with us regularly, proactively communicated with our vendors, and provided us with some very helpful advice which went above and beyond the expectations of an event coordinator (we didn't have a planner and she helped us to fill this gap very well). On the day of the wedding itself, the view was absolutely breath-taking. It's truly incredible how Fortino and our florist were able to transform the back patio into a wonderland of flowers, lush grass, and decorations. The staff was both friendly and attentive to our needs. Even though we had a large guest list (roughly 200), we had plenty of space and could've fit many more. Almost all of our guests danced throughout the reception thanks to a generously sized dance floor and an incredible DJ. Debbi was extremely active throughout the wedding and reception and made sure that we stayed on point. Again, her professionalism and attention to detail were highly impressive. Ah yes, and have I mentioned the wine?!? Fortino has a fantastic selection and many of their award-winning wines are on par with what you'd find in Napa or Sonoma (for a much higher price). The almond champagne is a clear standout. We had the chicken for dinner and it absolutely melted in our mouths. As I was sitting at the head table at dinner, I looked around at said to my wife, "This feels like a $100,000 wedding!!" Thanks to the reasonable prices at Fortino and in the greater Gilroy area, we spent a small fraction of that. I enthusiastically recommend Fortino Winery and Debbi Sanchez in particular!

I loved this venue!! The views, the people, everything about it made our day amazing.  
  
Leading up to the wedding, I was a little nervous about the food. No outside food vendors were permitted (same for all equipment rentals). We attended the bridal tasting in April, which allowed us to sample a number of dishes, but not all the items we had on our menu. We chose based on what sounded good, and Fortino came through with flying colors!! Our guests all complimented the food and we LOVED the family-style menu.   
  
We also loved that the winery allowed us to purchase wine during their case sales and store it there until the wedding. Can't beat that 40% off sale!!  
  
But more than anything else, we loved Debbi Sanchez, the event coordinator. She worked her TAIL off to help us pull off a great day. When we didn't order enough beer, she worked some magic to fix things. She had every detail covered and was such a joy to work with.   
  
The only totally nitpicking things I can criticize are easily fixed. The aisle was way too narrow for my dad and I to walk down side-by-side, so I'm ducking behind him in all our pictures. There were a LOT of bees during dinner (not unexpected for an outdoor event!). Our wine ceremony wasn't set up, which led to a very awkward ceremony, with our officiant doing a lot of "if there WAS wine, what I would say is...." My husband was not happy that we were charged for the wine tastings our wedding party and parents did before the rehearsal (there were 12 of us), given the amount of money we spent on the wedding (I wasn't at all bothered by that -- I don't think the venue owes us wine for showing up!)...and also the tasting room's attempt to charge for water while he waited for our first look pictures (which Debbi immediately rectified).   
  
That being said....this is a first-class establishment. The service during dinner was top-notch, and I can happily say I'd get married here all over again!

We had our August 5th wedding there, and it was absolutely the best day. I could not have asked for a better venue for my wedding, or a better coordinator (Debbi). She was so helpful and patient throughout the whole process. It seemed like it would be a daunting task planning the whole thing in 6 months from across the country, but she was able to answer ever question in a timely manner.  
  
Many guests came up to us and said that it was the most beautiful wedding that they had ever been to, and were raving about the food (as a guest at many weddings in the past few years, the food can often be pretty questionable, but I would actually go there for dinner if I could). On top of that, there is the wine and the almond champagne which is to die for.   
  
Fortino allowed us to have the wedding that we always wanted, casual, relaxed, fun and beautiful. I can't believe we had that at such a reasonable price as well. Couldn't have asked for a better day.

Debbi and the rest of the staff at Fortino Winery are AMAZING!!! My wedding was absolutely beautiful and SO much fun and I didn't have to worry about a thing the day of other than showing up. The food was delicious, the decor was classy, and everything was perfect. I would definitely, definitely, definitely recommend Fortino to any bride!

Everything was magnificent. If I wanted it any better it would have been impossible to do. The location of my event (retirement party) was absolutely beautiful. Outdoor venue had all the beauty one can ask for. The variety of table cloth colors we had to choose from are many and very pretty. The lights décor made is look so festive. Fortino’s has an excellent dancing floor. I kept getting multiple compliments on the menu and how good the food was. The service was amazing. Debbi the coordinator was very helpful and the greatest to work with. Her goal in making this a memorable event was and is deeply appreciated. All my guest were very happy and stayed until the end. I do not have enough words to praise Fortino Winery’ and the staff for making my event the highlight of the year on retirement parties in my company. Thank you Debbi for making my night so special and thank you Mr. Fortino for having such a BEAUTIFUL place to celebrate.

If you are searching for a beautiful outdoor venue with a friendly staff, look no further than Fortino Winery. The well-maintained reception area is hidden by tall trees on one side and a picturesque vineyard on the other, perfect for a ceremony and reception. I have had the pleasure to work with Terri and Debbi on a few occasions. I can tell that they love what they do because they always have smiles on their faces. The food is delicious, I highly recommend Fortino Winery for your special event.
