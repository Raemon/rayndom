We loved using Space Annex as our venue! The space is open, bright and with moveable walls and multiple levels, can be arranged so many different ways. Plus, the open rooftop patio was such a cool spot for our first dance at sunset. The industrial look of the brick outside, open ceilings, and metal railings was perfect for what we had in mind and our photographers loved everything about it too. I was especially excited about their custom woodtop tables - so beautiful that we didn't feel the need to mess with linens or greenery, or anything fancy/expensive just to cover them, AND included in the price of the venue rental which was very reasonable to begin with. The black chairs were also included and were comfy, blended in well and worked perfectly with the look of the tables. Working with Micky, the very kind manager, was so easy, and she gave us so many great recommendations - we went with both a caterer and a bar service that she recommended and had great experiences with each. I would recommned the Space Annex to anyone looking for a venue with character.

The Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art (BMOCA) was the perfect venue for our wedding. From the beginning, their communication was prompt, clear, and extremely helpful as we navigated the planning process. Sean, our main point of contact, was on top of all the details and worked seamlessly with our other vendors to ensure our day ran smoothly. The location and quality of service at BMOCA is a steal compared to many other wedding venues in Boulder - the space is elegant and affordable, and the museum's great location made it easy for our guests to access. For the value and the incredible service we received, we highly recommend BMOCA as a wonderful choice for any couple's special day.

The Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center is a gorgeous venue for your wedding! Unfortunately my rating is slightly lower than it could have been due to some staffing changes that affected all of their weddings this summer. We booked our venue for the ceremony and reception with the FAC in Fall of 2014 and thought we were set. We found out in early 2015 that there was a staffing change and our contract was fairly unclear. Fortunately, after some pushing, we were able to have what was promised to us at the initial contract signing and the new staff worked very hard to ensure we were happy on our special day. Some of their rules have changed and we were fortunate enough to have the flexibility to have the day we wanted (which is not an option going forward). Overall our families and guests thoroughly enjoyed the wedding and reception and the FAC, especially when we purchased the additional gallery access for our guests. I would recommend using the FAC for your day, just make sure you fully understand what is and is not included in your contract to ensure you get the most bang for your buck!

We had our dream wedding at the Museum! We held our ceremony at the Boettcher Plaza and the reception in the South Atrium and everything just looked incredibly stunning and the staff was just amazing to work with. They took so much stress out of our day - and having catering and lighting and rentals all through the Museum was a huge weight off our shoulders. Working with Molly, the event coordinator, was a dream - she is efficient, super responsive, detailed, and organized. She helped us with many last minute requests, was sooo flexible, and truly went above and beyond to meet our needs. The museum catering staff were just wonderful, and gave us the best service and we had some delicious food, including a stunning cake. Our guests just raved about everything! We could not have imagined getting married anywhere else, and we are also happy to be supporting this wonderful scientific and cultural institution in our city. We'll be forever grateful for the stress-free, dream wedding day the Museum has given us! We are so lucky to have gotten married here, and we will always be grateful to the Museum staff for giving us a dream wedding!

The Denver Art Museum was the perfect venue for our wedding. We got several compliments of the unique beauty that the museum provides. The staff is very professional and I had the utmost confidence in them before and during the event. Brenda, the event manager, made sure every detail was covered and executed each action with precision and confidence. The onsite caterer, Kevin Taylor, was some of the best wedding food I've ever had. They even made sure to provide my vegan cousins with their own special meals and when I wanted a unique menu item, they figured out a way to make it buffet ready. I highly recommend DAM for your wedding venue- you will not regret it!

This venue was great for our daughter’s rustic fall wedding. They are affordable and allow you to pick your own vendors, which was important to our daughter so she could get exactly what she wanted. They have plenty of parking and options for both indoor and outdoor areas. We went with a courtyard ceremony and an indoor reception in the pavilion. There is a nice Marriott hotel less than a mile away for the wedding party to get ready and guests to stay after.

We were incredibly happy with our choice of History Colorado as our wedding and reception venue. Its event spaces are beautiful, its price point was reasonable, and it is conveniently located just south of downtown Denver. We held the ceremony in the central atrium, with its beautiful Colorado-themed art and imagery. There is a topographic state map on the floor, a vintage Colorful Colorado welcome sign on one wall, and an entrance to the museum exhibits on another wall. Our guests could visit the museum exhibits for the hour between the ceremony and dinner, which was a great way to incorporate the museum venue into our festivities. And while we were concerned that the acoustics would be problematic in the atrium, there were no issues. We held the reception in the MDC-Richmond American Homes Foundation Terrace Room on the fourth floor. It has floor-to-ceiling windows on two walls and views of the city and mountains. There was plenty of space for our 170 guests to eat, drink, and dance. At the reception, we opted for an open bar. History Colorado offers several tiers, and we went with the premium beer and wine option. It was more expensive, but definitely worth it for the better-quality options. One incredibly nice touch was that the History Colorado team told us they had leftover alcohol from a prior event, and they put together a special mixed drink for our reception at no charge. Everyone we worked with at History Colorado was incredibly friendly and efficient. We are especially grateful to Natalie Schwab, the director of catering and event sales, who was our point person throughout the process. Natalie walked us through all of the details, met with us in the space multiple times to plan the perfect evening, and worked with us to make sure everything went as planned. In addition, the catering team was amazing—we loved all of the food we had! Overall, we loved History Colorado as a venue and can’t recommend it enough.
