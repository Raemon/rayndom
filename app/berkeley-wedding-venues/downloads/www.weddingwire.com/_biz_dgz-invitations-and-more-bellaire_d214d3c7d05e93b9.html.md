Mother of the Bride

DGZ did an amazing job on my daughter’s wedding invitations. Debbie and Meredith are a joy to work with and they made this process so easy and fun. Most importantly, the invitations they created are stunning! We have received so many compliments on the beauty of the invitations. I highly recommend this business!

Beautiful work and amazing customer service!

From the beginning, Debbie and Meredith were awesome to work with! They curated the perfect designs for our invitation suite and worked magic with our budget. They were quick to respond to edit requests and turn around updates. Our tri-fold pocket invitations turned out GORGEOUS! We got so many compliments on them! We knew we had to go with them when it came to our ceremony programs and day-of signage as well. Again everything came out so pretty and matched our colors and decor so well! We will be recommending Debbie and Meredith to all of our friends and family getting married in the future!

Wonderful Experience

Working with Debbie was truly a wonderful experience. From the time you meet with her over a glass of champagne to picking up your invitations with a mail bin that’ll help you deliver the invitations with ease to the post office, Debbie’s customer service is impeccable!   
  
Initially, it was a bit overwhelming at first because she had soooo many unique prints, materials, fonts, and colors (all good things but it made me second guess what I had envisioned for the invitations). She could literally create anything and I was so amazed by this! However, Debbie encouraged me to stick with my vision because she knew she could make something beautiful out it (& that she did). The invitations were perfect amount of elegance and modernity. I’m so glad I trusted her to create our invitations!

Gorgeous invitations!

I did not realize just how much detail is involved in wedding invitations, from the actual design down to the wording. Debbie helped my now husband and I create the most beautiful invitations. We went in not knowing anything about all the different types of paper, lettering, etc. but Debbie made everything easy by showing us actual invitation samples so we could see all the differences. She was also able to mesh two designs together to help us create the perfect invitations as I envisioned. Debbie even helped us with all the wording and showed us plenty of examples for that as well. The process was quick and easy overall. I believe we went through two rounds of proofs, in which we made some minor changes and Debbie was totally understanding and made sure the correct changes were applied. She wanted us to absolutely love the invitations. Debbie is definitely the person to go to for invitations, as she is extremely knowledgeable and professional about her work. Whatever your vision is, she will bring it to life!

Great experience & amazing invitations! 

Debbie was so great to work with! She was so helpful during the whole process!! We ended up getting our invitation suite from her, along with matching programs and a seating chart. We got so many compliments on everything!!! She was also VERY responsive, one of the quickest of my vendors! I always had an answer to my questions right away, and if she couldn't get me the answer right away due to other meetings, she always replied that she would get back to me ASAP! She was also so helpful with everything and was very patient when I had to get approvals from my mom and Fiance. What a great experience!

She listened to my daughter’s preferences, worked within our budget and responded timely to all of our requests. She made creative and excellent suggestions, and we are so pleased with the final product. She is a true gem!

Gorgeous Invitations

Getting married there are thousands of decisions to make, including the invitations. I met Debbie Zissman, owner of DGZ Invitations and More, with open arms. Jeff, my fiancé, and I sat down in Debbie’s beautiful office and she listened to us about the details of our wedding. We told her our budget and she showed us invitations with gorgeous prints and textures of paper, fabrics and even acrylic. After the our visit, Debbie would also email and call with other ideas, thoughts, and guided us with the next steps. We ended up choosing an invitation that was unique and special just for our special day. Thank you Debbie for making this process of picking out our beautiful invitations easy, fun and without any stress. You are the best Debbie!
