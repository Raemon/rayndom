The Historic Callahan House is beautiful. The decorations for the holidays were amazing. We had a small ceremony in the upstairs room. We followed with a short reception downstairs. Everything was gorgeous and the helpful staff made things go smoothly. There are many restrictions due to this being a historic building however none of it hindered our plans. The home was the perfect backdrop to our winter theme. The amazing pictures will be cherished for decades to come.

My wife and I were married at the Tack Shed on 8/31/25 and we couldn't have picked a better venue or friendlier venue owners to work with for our big day! From when we first toured the venue to when we left the venue after our ceremony, Christine and Derek did everything we could have asked for or expected to help us feel comfortable and make sure the day went smoothly. They were also quickly up front and transparent with pricing when we first showed interest in the venue, which was very appreciated! On our wedding day, there were some scattered showers and it was overcast, but Christine and Derek ensured everything went smoothly and that the weather ended up being only an afterthought. Before we sat the guests, Derek went out and hand wiped down all the chairs so they were dry for the ceremony, which was very kind. You can tell Christine and Derek both love their venue and take great care of it, while also providing great service and friendliness. We are so happy we made the choice to get married at the Tack Shed, and recommend it to any other couple who would like to get married in the most beautiful place in the US!

We could not have imagined a more perfect place to get married than The Rose. From the moment we stepped inside, we knew it was the one—the atmosphere is stunning, the staff is warm and professional, and every detail feels intentional and elegant. A huge part of why we chose this venue was Patricia, the day-of coordinator. She is truly exceptional. From our very first meeting, she made us feel supported, understood, and completely at ease. She handled every question with patience and expertise, and on the wedding day she was an absolute superstar—organized, calm, and always two steps ahead. Patricia made everything run flawlessly, and her kindness and professionalism elevated the entire experience. Our wedding day was beyond anything we could have hoped for, and The Rose—and especially Patricia—played a huge role in making it magical. Highly, highly recommend!

We had such a wonderful experience with Pinecrest. All the staff was timely, excellent with communication, flexible, helpful, and accommodating. The chapel and reception hall were beautiful, and I did not have to worry about anything the day of the wedding. Pinecrest had so many decorations I could use, and all the vendors were extremely easy to work with. I would recommend Pinecrest to all!

We had our ceremony and reception at the Lakewood Heritage Center and loved it! We used the amphitheater for the ceremony and the school house for the reception. Julie was our main contact throughout the planning process, and she was incredibly responsive, helpful, and flexible! Julie was organized throughout the whole process and very patient with our questions. She really made working with the venue incredibly easy for us. The staff who were present on our wedding day were also helpful and respectful, although I had limited contact with them. The grounds at the Lakewood Heritage Center are beautiful and well kept. There are plenty of picture opportunities at the lake, in front of the vintage buildings, by the barn and farm buildings, etc. Everything was clean and well-maintained on our wedding date, and our guests loved the venue. The amphitheatre was great for the ceremony because we wanted to be outdoors and, despite the heat of the day, the shade from the amphitheatre helped keep our guests cool. The school house was extremely cute, and it helped that we were able to use the indoor space as well as the side yard for outdoor space. We had dinner tables, buffet, and bar inside. The space easily fit seating for 40 guests at round tables, the buffet, bar, a 5-person band, and some room for dancing. We used the side yard for additional cocktail tables and lawn games. Since it was a blazing summer afternoon, the A/C in the school house was a welcome relief from the heat. We had a fantastic time! If we should ever need to throw another large party, I'd love to have it at the LHC again!

We got married on 7/20/2024 and had the most incredible experience! We booked our wedding reception here with the old owners in 2023, but we had the BEST experience with the new 2024 management, Chantal. She was responsive to all of our needs and requests, and even let us come by the day before the wedding to set up. She helped make our reception run smoothly so that we could enjoy our special day with our friends and family. They have also updated a lot of things including the chairs, floors, and bridal suite. Overall, we were very impressed and would highly recommend this lovely, rustic venue.

If you want a venue that requires little decorating but provides the absolute best industrial/elegant vibe you will absolutely love Mile High Station! The organization and communication with the venue was incredible and so smooth...especially since we were planning this all out of state. They made sure all of our requests were met and if they weren't able to help us they directed us in the direction. The bartenders and venue staff the day of the wedding were incredible and made sure we had a fantastic evening!

We hosted our Welcome Reception at Rembrandt Yard and we had a wonderful experience with them! The venue is stunning with beautiful views of Downtown Boulder and the Flatirons and there was plenty of room for our guests to mingle. We could tell Morgan and Lianne truly cared about our event and were quick to respond to emails throughout the planning process. Our guests had a wonderful evening and we are very grateful we had our Welcome Reception at Rembrandt Yard!
