We chose the Seaside room for our ceremony (on the patio) and reception; catered by Ranch Events. The service and food is awesome, we are very pleased we choose that venue. We had Ramon as our day of coordinator and everything turned out perfect with no issues. Highly recommend!

Celebrated my wedding here and have absolutely no regrets. Staff was friendly and quick to respond. They also had recommendations for vendors since I was overwhelmed trying to book things like linens and flowers (you have the option to pick anyone of your choosing though). The hall also included dishes/silverware for our guests! It was difficult to find a venue that could accommodate our very large wedding for a reasonable price - so I was so grateful to find this place. Tons of free parking on site which is a rare find in LA. Nearby hotels for your guests. Playground for children and plenty of outdoor space to gather. The hall itself is massive and has a cathedral feel to it with beautiful chandeliers. There is a large bar and huge stage for a band as well. Everything was very clean as well which was important to us. You really can’t go wrong with this place, check it out!

The coordinators were amazing to work with! They're responsive, kind, and easy to communicate with. The venue itself was absolutely beautiful and I had many people comment on the view. Food was good (not as good as dining at the restaurant) but everything was cooked well for a large amount of people. Everything at the wedding went as expected, and I cannot thank Tom Ham's more for an amazing wedding.

I had always dreamed of having a romantic and elegant wedding. From the gardens and gazebos to the charming, historical chapel and the majestic Victorian mansion, our evening was magical. The food was divine and the staff was dedicated to making our wedding special. As it is a one stop shopping experience, the planning was easy. Dancing into the night with my husband under a canopy of twinkle lights to the beautiful music from the grand piano in the greenhouse is a moment I will cherish. Thank you Edward's Mansion for a dream come true.

BOOK THEM NOW! We can't express how thankful we are to University Club of Pasadena for hosting our dream wedding. My husband and I toured countless venues and the services University Club provides exceeded them all. 1\. You get the venue for the entire day! Other venues we toured had strict times we could enter, some even requiring the bride to arrive completely ready because there wasn't a space for HMU. Cinthia was so flexible and even allowed us to arrive at 6AM to begin getting ready! We had a brunch spread with our family/bridal party there, where Cinthia had the staff assist with setting up and tearing down our brunch tables. 2\. The bar package is VERY flexible compared to other venues. We noticed that most of the venues we considered have a per-head cost, expensive since some of our elderly don't drink. UC instead allowed us to set a general bar limit, which afterwards they would convert into a cash bar (we didn't end up reaching our limit, but this was a very cost-effective set-up for us). 3\. Joy and Tony were incredible at customizing our drinks! Joy had so many creative suggestions for Asian inspired drinks - they allowed us to have multiple taste testings and we landed on a lychee mojito and strawberry soju in a martini glass. We had SO many guests rave about our signature drinks, asking us for the recipes! 4\. They went above and beyond for desserts!!!! We were so disappointed when other venues either don't allow outside vendors or have a fee - we're not cake people so we wanted to bring in Fosselman's ice cream instead. Cinthia and Chef Tony not only allowed us to bring in outside ice cream, but even told us that UC regularly serves Fosselman's for the club members so they could provide the ice cream for us instead of us bringing it! We originally wanted an ice cream bar, but they informed us they could only scoop the ice cream from the kitchen and have the waiters pass them around on trays because of their freezer location. However, the week of our wedding, Cinthia called us and said they've figured out a way to create our ice cream bar! It meant so much to us that UC was still trying to figure out a way to have our dream dessert station even though my husband and I were fine with tray-passed ice cream - and SO many guests complimented us for the ice cream station! 5\. Cinthia and Chef Tony are very willing to work with you to make sure the entrees are exactly the way you want it! We initially weren't incredibly happy with the salmon during out taste testing, so they had us come in again to try the chicken with another free taste test (this is a huge deal - other venues often charge for taste tests)! They even allowed us to sub mashed potatoes for scalloped potatoes etc. I'll be honest - we thought the food at our taste testing was okay, pretty decent wedding food. BUT the food the night of our wedding was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! We had so many guests (some of our guests are even wedding coordinators) compliment us for the food! Multiple parents also said this wedding had the best kid meals they've ever seen with delicious chicken tenders and fries - I had a dad even ask if he could also have a kids meal! Other details that makes UC stand out... \- Parking ON SITE with a private lot! \- You have the entire building to yourself! \- Indoors in case of rain! \- I noticed some wedding websites giving UC three dollar signs, but this venue is actually VERY accommodating to your budget with fair prices \- 10/10 STAFF. Cinthia, Tony (bar), Tony (chef), and Joy are absolutely amazing to work with!

The Diamond Bar Center was amazing both outside and inside. Once our dream vision became a reality, it was breathtaking and unbelievable. If you want gorgeous sunset or night pictures, this is the location you want. With it being on top of a hill, you get a great overview of the city and a wonderful sunset to match.

I cannot express how grateful my husband and I are to have booked our wedding reception at The Grand. We worked primarily with Marissa and Lauren on this event for close to 18 months due to postponements as a result of COVID. What stands out about this venue is their professionalism. We opted to go with this venue primarily for this reason and the value for what you are getting. Throughout all the changes, they were nothing but responsive and helpful in any way they could be. My emails were always answered promptly. Despite all the stress from having to change my wedding plans, I never had to worry about being taken care of at The Grand. When my husband and I finally had our event this past October, everything on our agreement was delivered as promised. Zero issues whatsoever. We had great waitstaff and a super fun bartender. The venue itself was set up beautifully. Thank you so much to everyone at The Grand for creating such a beautiful day for us.
