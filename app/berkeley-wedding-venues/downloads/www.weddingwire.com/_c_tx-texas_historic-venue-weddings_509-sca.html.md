We had our wedding here in November 2025 and it was amazing! Between the spacious reception area and the stunning chapel (which may or may not have been my favorite part) there was such a great place to get married. My husband and I are so blessed to been able to have our wedding at Hidden Gem Villa. Kasey was not only a great coordinator but a great host as well - she took great care of us and our guests during wedding prep, during and afterwards! Thank you so much!

34Events was the absolute perfect venue for our wedding. The space is beautiful and exactly what we envisioned for our day. We hosted both our ceremony and reception there for 150 guests, and it couldn’t have worked out better. One of the biggest advantages of 34Events is how much is handled in-house. From linens and flatware to special lighting, catering, and the bar, so much was coordinated through the venue, which made the planning process incredibly easy and stress-free. The food was prepared on-site and was delicious. We received numerous compliments from our guests. We also utilized Hope’s Day-of Coordination services, and it was worth every penny. Hope is simply amazing. She made the entire day feel calm and effortless, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment. We are so grateful for her care, organization, and attention to detail. Both Hope and Alex were incredibly responsive throughout the process, and we genuinely enjoyed working with them. If you’re looking for a stunning venue with outstanding service and a team that truly takes care of you, we cannot recommend 34Events enough. We had a perfect day thanks to them.

We were very excited to get married and the Hall of State! The price was very reasonable, and we fell in love with it as soon as we walked in. They host many events, including weddings, so they have almost everything you need. They have a preferred list of vendors for catering, and that made life easier because we didn't have to worry about making sure a vendor we wanted to use new the ropes of this historic building. Nora was very helpful, and our planner communicated with her often to make sure our day went as planned. Beautiful venue, beautiful wedding!

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ From Andrea & Jeremy Still not over our wedding at AvantGarden. Truly the best day of our lives. The bartenders kept everyone happy all night — amazing drinks, the sweetest energy, and somehow always one step ahead of the crowd. Our florist understood the assignment. The flowers were dreamy, effortless, and made the whole space feel like a little world of its own. The DJ had the perfect vibe from the moment guests walked in to the last song. Zero skips. Dance floor packed. Pure magic. The taco truck… unreal. People are still texting us about those tacos. Total crowd favorite. And our coordinator Mariana was an angel. Calm, organized, and genuinely caring. We got to actually enjoy our day because they handled everything behind the scenes. AvantGarden gave us a night we’ll remember forever. If you’re thinking about getting married here — do it. It’s everything.

We chose The Winfield Inn for my son and his bride's wedding because of the beauty of the venue, its location & the affordability, not knowing how far and above it would exceed our expectations! Our event took place in late March, which also happened to be Easter Weekend. The blankets of wildflowers in bloom along the Texas highways and in the yards of the quaint little town of Kyle, gave a fragrant and beautiful welcome to our guests. The massive oak trees and sprawling green lawns are the perfect backdrop for an elegant Hill Country wedding. Many of our guests commented on how perfect the size of the venue was for our group of 150; not too big to minimize conversation and fun and not too small so that you are stepping on each other while dancing. Parking is ample and well lit for evening events. The ranch house is decorated with antique furnishings which gave our photographer more than enough spaces and backdrops to use for amazing photos, not to mention the enormous white columns on the front of the home. We felt like we were in Savannah, GA. Our ceremony took place at the gazebo and reception in the pavilion. It doesn't take much to decorate this area because it is naturally so pretty. The Pavilion is gorgeous with its chandeliers in an open-air space. There are plenty of tables and chairs and Jack will set them out according to your preference. Leslie, the owner, is so very friendly and kind to work with. He also allowed our wedding party to stay the night at the Inn before the wedding. This enabled all the girls and guys to have a place to gather together and prepare for the Big Day! The upstairs sunporch is the best part of the house! It was in this enclosed wrap-around porch where my daughter in law and her bridal party were able to use natural lighting for applying makeup and getting the best pictures! We also hosted a sweet bridal brunch there while the girls were getting ready. I highly recommend The Winfield Inn for your wedding! I am hopeful that one of our guests will choose it for their wedding in the future so that I can come back as a guest! Nicole - Mother of the Groom

After COVID canceled our destination wedding in 2020, we knew we wanted to stay local. After looking at venus throughout San Antonio, we KNEW SABOT was PERFECT! It had the tropical feel we were going for, without the sand or a flight! The ceremony took place in the amphitheater and the reception was in the conservatory. We could not have found a more dreamy location and the SABOT team was amazing to work with! Highly recommend!

The Tremont House was a beautiful venue and incredibly accommodating. The Davidson Ballroom was a perfect ceremony and reception location and the food was delicious. We had many people tell us that it was the best food they have ever had at a wedding. Our catering manager was Angie and she went above and beyond to make our day perfect. Each time we contacted her, she was very responsive and eager to help us with anything we asked. She was equally as great on our wedding day. Our guests really enjoyed the location of our wedding, especially since many were from out of town. There is a lot to do in and around the Tremont! The Tremont House also made for beautiful wedding pictures! : )

For all my vintage girlies, look no further! Book The Cotton Mill right away. It was easily one of the best decisions we made. It fit our style perfectly and I got SO many compliments about the venue. You do have to use their catering company but the food is fantastic! We were blown away at how good it was and not one single complaint about it. The Cotton Mill is very easy to work with and I loved the bridal suite for getting ready. 15/10 recommend.
