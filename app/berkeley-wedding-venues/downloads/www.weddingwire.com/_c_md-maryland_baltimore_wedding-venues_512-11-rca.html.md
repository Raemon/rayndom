Antrim 1844 is truly a world-class wedding venue. From start to finish, they were the most prepared and professional team we could have imagined—every moment and detail felt planned down to a science. They were incredibly accommodating to both us and our guests, stocking our room with signature drinks and hors d’oeuvres after the ceremony, saving our wedding dinner in case we didn’t get a chance to eat, and setting up champagne and our wedding cake for after the after-party. The level of care was unmatched—whether it was helping with setup or running to grab the bride coffee whenever she needed it, nothing was too small. Our banquet manager, Dan, was an absolute standout. From walking us through a perfectly timed and paired tasting to ensuring dinner ran smoothly the night of, he was personable, inviting, and endlessly accommodating to both us and our guests. He truly felt like the star of the operation. Our day-of coordinator, Katie, was equally phenomenal. She supported us from the earliest stages of planning through the after-party and made sure everything ran seamlessly and according to plan. Thanks to her expertise, we were able to incorporate all the personal touches we wanted—from special cocktail-hour napkins to pizza delivery for the after-party. We cannot recommend Antrim 1844 highly enough.

Shannon absolutely wonderful to work with! From the moment we began working with her she brought such a cheerful and calming energy. She was organized, attentive, and always one step ahead—making sure every detail was taken care of without us having to worry about a thing. Thanks to her, everything ran smoothly from start to finish, and we were able to truly enjoy the day with our guests. She was friendly, professional, and such a pleasure to work with—we couldn’t have asked for a better gal to help make our day to special at CBF.

The staff at Best Western was absolutely fantastic . The cost was great & so was the food. It's Baltimore's best kept secret . Kim & Hin, Banquet Managers were very accommodating. They assisted me throughout all of the planning. The menu selection was diverse and the dishes were amazing. My guest are still talking about the food two weeks after the wedding.

The most magical day! So many of our guests reached out and said it was amazing, food was delicious and the venue is absolutely beautiful. Breanna & her staff were so nice and on top of it all! It was the special touches that stood out and make this this most excellent venue.

Our wedding at Linganore Winecellars on September 27, 2025 was everything we dreamed of and more. The property is absolutely breathtaking — the ceremony site overlooking the acres of vineyards felt like something out of a movie. Even with a little rain in the forecast, the views and atmosphere were still magical. Guests kept telling us how beautiful and unique the setting was, especially the mix of outdoor elegance and rustic-chic charm. From the beginning, the venue team was wonderful to work with. They were responsive, organized, and genuinely cared about making sure everything went smoothly. Communication was always clear, and they were flexible with last-minute details and changes, which helped ease so much of the pre-wedding stress. Every question we had — big or small — was met with kindness and professionalism. Our Day-of Coordinator, Brittany, deserves her own standing ovation. She went above and beyond from start to finish — keeping us calm, managing the timeline perfectly, coordinating vendors, and somehow being everywhere at once. She even had a backup plan ready when the rain rolled in and made sure everything transitioned flawlessly. I barely had to lift a finger because Brittany had already handled it before I even realized something needed attention. She truly made it possible for us to be fully present and enjoy the day. We’ll never forget how cared for we felt — not just like another couple on the calendar, but like our day truly mattered. Linganore gave us the romantic, warm, vineyard wedding we’d always envisioned, and Brittany made sure it unfolded effortlessly. If you want a venue that’s picturesque, professional, and filled with heart, Linganore Winecellars is it. And if you’re lucky enough to have Brittany as your coordinator, you’ll be in the very best hands.

The Liriodendron Mansion was the second venue we toured back in 2024, and we instantly fell in love with it. Tucked away in a quiet Bel Air neighborhood, the mansion was once home to Dr. Howard Kelly — one of the founders of Johns Hopkins and the inventor of the Kelly clamp — before being sold to the county. The exterior is breathtaking, with two elegant porticos framing each side of the house. Behind the mansion, you’ll find a spacious patio that can comfortably seat 60–70 guests for dinner, surrounded by lush greenery and soft string lights overhead. The staff were wonderful throughout the entire process — from our initial walk-throughs to day-of coordination — and made everything feel seamless. If you’re looking for a venue with timeless charm, romantic ambiance, and a covered outdoor space perfect for dancing and cocktails, this is it. I highly recommend visiting — you’ll fall in love just like we did.

While our event was a reunion and not a wedding, the professionalism, communication, and event pricing are still very relevant. I cannot express enough how fantastic Kate and the Circle D Farm staff were with helping us have a successful family reunion. Kate was kind and patient. She answered every question. Came up with solutions for various issues that we had that came up prior to the reunion. She patiently worked with me when I was out of the country and still trying to plan. She understands event planning and mentioned things that I did not consider. On the day of the event, the food was delicious, the service was excellent, and even more importantly, we did not have to worry about the logistics of food preparation and clean up. We could concentrate on being with each other and having fun reconnecting. The pricing was reasonable. We enjoyed the rustic environment of the farm. We highly recommend Kate and Circle D Farm and would definitely have a reunion there again.
