Seamless and Communicative Venue 10/10

We hosted a wedding at Club Los Meganos on 11/8/24. Katrina, Lily, and staff were very professional, collected, responsive, and helpful throughout this process. The venue offers many delicious food options and really puts your vision together. There are not enough words to say to recommend this venue as it is perfect to host a wedding of any size and any time of the year. Katrina was so calm and cheerful the day before and the day of that it helped me calm down and not stress. I enjoyed this venue as they have great recommended vendors and room for creativity, and it was great not to have to outsource everything. I highly recommend touring the venue and talking with the staff to see the vision come together and answer all your questions.

With over 40 years experience as a wedding planer, I can say that I have never working with crew that was accommodating and right there when needed. 

The crew at Meganos were the key to a stress free wedding. Very accommodating and professional. I wish everyone could have their weddings here. Very spacious and beautiful. Katrina and her crew are the best.

Wedding Day 10.7.22

I'm a few years late in writing a review. Finally found the time to do one so here it goes!   
  
I have nothing but positive reviews and I highly recommend this place to anyone for any occasion.   
  
Club Los Meganos was our last stop in our search for a wedding venue, and although we were already set on one venue we visited prior to this one, my husband and I decided to check the place out. And we were so glad we did!   
  
The grounds were absolutely stunning. It was spacious, modern...with a beautiful garden for people to socialize and take tons of photos. They also have a lovely vineyard where we took sunset pictures. They have lighted bocce courts and lawn games such as chess (great for kids to hang out). It really is a venue for any age to enjoy.  
  
My husband and I immediately fell in love with the space, and agreed that Club Los Meganos was the ONE. So we said yes to the venue and booked it for our wedding on Oct 7, 2022.  
  
We worked closely with Monica and Lily, the event manager and coordinator at Club Los Meganos at the time. And they were awesome! They were prompt in answering our emails and super accommodating with our wishes. They were detail oriented and proactive, making sure we have the correct colored linens, our floor plan was up to date, our signature drinks were made to our liking, etc--and communicating with our own wedding coordinator to make sure the big day goes smoothly. One week prior to our wedding day, we had an entire family who unfortunately couldn't make it to the wedding, and at this point we have already provided the venue our total numbers. So instead of having their plates go to waste and money go to waste, we asked if the money could go towards the open bar instead, and they went above and beyond to do so for us. I don't think alot of venues would do that for their clients, so we were grateful they did.   
  
Our wedding day was amazing, and we couldn't be any happier with how it turned out. The one thing my husband and I wanted during the big day, was to be stress free and to enjoy the moment. And thanks to our awesome vendors, they made sure we didn't have to worry about a thing.   
  
In the end, we received alot of compliments from our wedding guests, raving about the venue and how organized the event was. We have our amazing vendors, including the Club Los Meganos team to thank for that.

An outstanding and wonderful time

It was such a great decision to host our dream wedding at Club Los Meganos. The venue is very spacious and was absolutely perfect for our outdoor ceremony and indoor reception. The garden area outside was a wonderful place for everyone to socialize, take pictures, and play games. Everyone had a great time during happy hour while the staff served delicious hors d'oeuvres and plenty of drinks! The dining area inside had ample seating and our guests really loved all of the food options at the buffet. We also really enjoyed the photobooth and the open dance floor that both became big hits all throughout the night.  
  
Last but not least, Lilian is a very friendly event manager who made sure that our dream wedding went by smoothly. She was super accommodating throughout the entire planning process and was readily available to help out and to answer all of our questions. Overall, we would highly recommend the venue and the staff for an amazing and fun time!

Phenomenal

Our entire experience was absolutely perfect! I had endless questions and each one was answered quickly every time and they were MORE than accommodating throughout the entire process. Monica was a gem and I really enjoyed working with her just as much as I enjoyed working with Lily. You can tell that the staff wants your day to be just as perfect as you do and the care is truly felt. My guests have been RAVING about everything. The food is to die for! The rolls were warm, the drinks were cold, all the food was fresh and delicious and the bar ran super smoothly! The lawn games and the fire pits were an absolute crowd favorite and everyone had a great time! We cannot recommend this venue enough and will relive our best day for years to come.

Beautiful Venue

The beginning experience wasn’t the greatest, the initial Event Manager was great when we were first touring the place and after we had put our deposit it was a bit hard to reach her at times. The other issue is the lack of communication, that the same staff no longer works at the venue and no one communicated that with us. The place is really beautiful but if I had known the Event Manager wouldn’t handle our wedding properly we may have turned down the place. We’re really glad everything worked out and once we had a new contact person (Jessica) and she was really nice and informative. We heard nothing but compliments of the place and the fire pit was used all night. It’s a very big venue and honestly for the amount of guest we had there were plenty of room. The staff were all very nice and all our guest were taken care of. The landscape was beautiful and so many different area to take pictures. Jessica was honestly the best and because of her, I would recommend this hidden gem.

TL;DR: Club Los Meganos was able to give us the most memorable and special ceremony and reception, despite quarantine in 2020. If you are looking for an amazing group of people who go above and beyond for you, this is where you need to get married. Shoutout to the following people:  
\- Our Wonder Woman event planner: Kristen McElley  
\- Our Hardworking wedding concierge: Jessie Rodriguez  
\- Our beautifully sweet event assistant: Lacey Lopez  
  
When my husband and I were looking for a venue that would accommodate the number of people for our wedding, we were met were overrated prices and crazy additional costs that weren't needed. I was becoming discouraged about finding the perfect venue for our reception until my husband found Club Los Meganos. From the first phone call with the events manager, Kristen, I knew there was going to be something special about this place.  
  
We made our way to the venue and were immediately met with a welcoming crew. Kristen showed us the space and how pricing would go, and we were SHOCKED at how reasonable the price was for such a huge space! She made herself available at all times whenever we had questions, concerns, or changes, making our worries at ease. Even when changes were being made in the venue space, she made it her priority to always call us and let us know so that we can check any changes with our vendors.   
  
Then the worst news happened: Covid hit and stay at home orders were implemented. We kept in touch with Kristen over the next few months to make sure we were still able to have our wedding. With encouraging moments of being able to do a taste test with our parents, choosing our linens, making our programs, meeting wedding concierge Jessie, and meeting event assistant, Lacy, we felt that everything was going to be okay. Even with cutting down our guest count, everything seemed full speed ahead. And once again our fears were met: Contra Costa was moving into a purple tier three weeks before the wedding. My husband and I prayed and kept in close contact with Kristen during the next week as she was figuring out if we were in the clear. And finally on that Friday three weeks before, we got the green light.  
  
On the day of the rehearsal, Kristen and her team were on top of everything. From getting everyone in place, to arranging seats and timing of walking down the aisle, it went smoothly. Mid-rehearsal, all of us received was seemed like an amber alert on our phones. Looking we saw that the stay at home order was implemented again, but this time it was the day AFTER the wedding! We couldn't have been more thrilled!  
  
The day of the wedding came, and Kristen and the team were able to let us into our respective suites and bring us anything we needed to make sure we got ready on time. From getting us drinks, making sure my husband and I didn't see each other until I walked down the aisle, getting items in and our of our dressing room, and even to hype all of the wedding party up, they made it so much easier for us to breathe and enjoy the moment. Our ceremony was the most beautiful moment in our lives, and no issues happened that day. They kept us on time even to do a vineyard shoot before our reception, and made sure we were the first people taken care of.   
  
I was surprising my husband with a special number from Selena, which I had to change my outfit mid reception. They made sure to get me in and out of my outfit in time to perform, and that was the highlight of the day. Ending the night with some sparklers and a delicious fry bar, I knew nothing could compare to this day.   
  
I know this is super long, but you have to understand how much Kristen, Jessie, and Lacey did for us and our wedding. They went above and beyond what any normal event planners would do for their clients. In the end they weren't just someone we hired, they became our family. Thank you again Club Los Meganos for making our wedding day the most memorable and special day of our lives. We love you all so much.  
  
Love Always,  
Malcolm & Chelseah Henzaga

Amazing venue

To sum it up: the staff is great, the food is AMAZING, and the venue is gorgeous. Kristen is the seriously the best Wedding Coordinator ever, and I wish I could have married her instead of my husband. My mom was a mother of the bridezilla, and Kristen was so kind and responsive to her. She was also really great about letting us come to the venue as much as we wanted to try out our decorations, etc. etc. We got married Nov. 2020, during the pandemic, and the venue made sure everything was in place to keep their staff and our guests safe. For months we weren’t even sure if we were going to be able to get married due to our county being closed, and Kristen was so supportive during that time.

Gorgeous venue, amazing coordinators, flawless staff, amazing wedding

Well where to begin, Cynthia & Kristen were our coordinators and day of coordinators. First I want to say that they are incredible at their job, emails were promptly responded to, changes were made immediately, and their expert advice made our wedding go beyond expectations.  
  
I think most people would have a lot of anxiety during not only the wedding planning stages but also the day of but I can tell you that with these guys and their team, we had zero stress, zero anxiety and of course ZERO problems. They planned everything down to the minute, and even though we were the reasons that things didn't go on time, they were excellent at handling any last minute changes.  
  
When we were behind, they never pushed us to get back to our original routine, but rather asked us what we wanted and how we wanted it. Best yet, most of this was done behind the scenes, they allowed us to have all the fun we wanted while maintaining the structure that all weddings have.  
  
If I had the chance to redo it all over again, we would book the same venue and hire the same coordinators. I can't thank them enough for making sure that our special day was the most special day we've ever had! And they achieved it, beyond our wildest dreams.  
  
Now a bit about the venue, it is freaking GORGEOUS. The ceremonial lawn was huge and scenic. The minimalist lawn area added a degree of elegance that we hadn't expected. The actual hall was gorgeous, and HUGE we had about 120 people and we easily could have had double that. The entire grounds were amazing, so much room for everyone to roam around in. I didn't even get a chance to explore the entire place as it was way too big for how fast everything went.  
  
If you guys want a place that's already beautiful and requires very little decorations, this is it. Some uplights and flowers are all you need (maybe not even flowers?). The staff is incredibly polite, professional and extremely well trained. Everyone at our wedding loved the venue, and they loved how kind each and every member of the staff was. I honestly cannot recommend this place enough, I can't recommend our coordinators enough.  
  
I would say, take your chances with them (but honestly you're not gambling at all, these guys are the real deal!). Do yourselves a favor, book Club Los Meganos and don't look back. Your day will be beyond expectation.  
  
Love,  
Navi & Vinh 2019

The best and easiest day!

Club Los Meganos was the very first and only venue I looked at. I got engaged in November 2018 and had my eye on CLM for months. We weren't actively planning a wedding, then something hit us and we decided to plan a wedding in two months. Kristen came to save the day and help me figure it all out. I thought (and knew) I was crazy for wanting to plan a semi-big wedding in two months, but Kristen reassured me every step of the way. We were SO lucky that everything was available for a Monday wedding, and even luckier that we had Kristen guiding us through the whole process. I can't say enough great things about Club Los Meganos and the level of service provided. Kristen accommodated (and cheered on) my ideas and went above and beyond. My guests couldn't stop talking about how great the food was, how delicious our signature drinks were, how awesome the outdoor games were, how yummy the sundae bar was, and how sweet the venue was. There were plenty of areas to relax outside away from the music. We had something going on at all times and I didn't even have to think about setting it all up or taking it all down. Kristen and her team were ON IT. I can rave for hours, days, months, and years to come. My husband and I highly recommend booking this venue. It was affordable, the service was great, and the options are endless. We loved every second of our experience!
