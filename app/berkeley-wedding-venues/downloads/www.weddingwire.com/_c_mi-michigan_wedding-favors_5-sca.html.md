My husband and I recently were married in Cancun and came home to find out that our venue for our reception had been double booked and we literally were left with nothing because the venue we signed with also did the catering, dj, cake and decorations. We had found a venue almost right away....definetly not what we had really wanted....and thought we had found a shop who would rent out everything we needed to us only to find out days before our event that she was going out of business. So I did an online search and found Kim's website and emailed her and within minutes I received and email back from Micheal. I spoke with Kim the next day and just a day before my reception, she literally saved our entire day. She helped us out so much I cannot even begin to describe how thankful we are. That night she pulled everything out of storage we asked for and to our surprise also gave us everything else we needed and thought we would not be able to find. Kim and Micheal are truly amazing and I would recommend them to anyone and everyone. Her shop is amazing and she obviously works very hard to keep it lookig great and having everything right there for you to see. Thank you so much to the O'Briens for making our day amazing!!!

We got amazing pop corn from Will Cole. They were flexible and make an amazing product. I am sad to say we are still handing it out though as not only did my husband over-order, but we forgot it at home on our wedding day! It was a bit expensive, but very worth the smiles it brings.

We used Joann's Fudge for our wedding favors and were very happy with how they turned out. The guests raved about the double dark espresso fudge and many had finished them before the night was over. Sue was prompt and professional in her responses. A special detail for our wedding day we loved!

Deb's supplier was back-ordered on our item, so she was unable to fill our order. She sacrificed the sale to make sure we got our wedding favors on time. Prompt, excellent service!

Had pretzels for my late night snack with beer cheese dip! It was a hit - three months later and people still are raving about them!

We ordered nautical-themed socks for the groom and as gifts for the groomsmen from BoldSocks.com and were really pleased with our purchase. We went with navy and turquoise striped socks with anchors on them, which worked with our theme. The socks arrived in no time and were very high quality. Our photographer captured a great shot of all the men sporting their groovy socks, which is a fun memento from our magical day.
