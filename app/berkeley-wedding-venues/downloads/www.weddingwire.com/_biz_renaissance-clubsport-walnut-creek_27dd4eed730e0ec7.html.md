I have done several events at Renaissance Club Sport. Lovely venue and the staff is top-notch. They always go above and beyond for the clients, members ande vendors. I know that when I have an event at this venue that things will be set-up and ready when I arrive and the staff will do whatever necessary to accomadate any last minute needs! Fran and Stacey are especially awesome to work with!
