We went through Complete for a wedding DJ and they did not disappoint. They were very easy to work with and flexible with helping us in any way we needed. We had Tommy as our DJ and he absolutely crushed it. He kept the party going and he was incredible to work with. Would recommend Tommy for any event!

We could not have asked for a better DJ than Joey for our ceremony and reception. From his ability to clearly communicate about the finer details to being extremely flexible with our schedule and adjusting meeting times, Joey helped make our planning process worry & stress free. I had two requirements for how I wanted my reception to go: I wanted to dance and I wanted the music to feel seamless throughout the night. From his perfectly curated playlists for different parts of the wedding day to our dances and every moment in-between, everything felt personal and like we could truly tailor our wedding day soundtrack to our personalities. Any request we had, Joey was able to meet it and go above and beyond our expectations. Not only was he able to accommodate our outside ceremony plus our inside reception, but you would hardly notice the change inbetween. Joey was the perfect mix of professional and fun. He brought the energy to our dance floor and helped bring our wedding to life. Friends and family have told us he was the best DJ at a wedding they’ve ever been to and we couldn’t agree more. Thank you Joey!!! -The Hixsons

Everyone at our wedding had so much fun! We got so many compliments on the flow of the music and all the little details and fun add-ins that we had arranged with Alex Pacheco! Simply Ballroom helped make our day truly special to us and our guests! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fun and energetic wedding reception!

Adrian and his team took care of my wedding ceremony and reception! The dance floor was always busy and still to this day I hear how awesome of a DJ he was. He had great communication and was very patient with any last minute things. Another perk is that he is bilingual and he made everyone feel welcome. Would definitely 100% recommend to have at your reception and or ceremony and or bday parties!

I’ve had the pleasure of working with Brent and other DJs on their team on a number of occasions and I can confidently say they are the best DJ’s in town! They bring such an excellent energy to your event - from weddings, corporate events, birthday parties and more. Their playlists are always on the spot and gets the energy going, and they tailor it to your music taste and vibe of the event. They know how and when to switch up the music for the more slow & intentional parts of your event, as well as the more high energy times that you can’t help but dance to. If you’re looking for a DJ for any event, I can’t recommend them enough! They get the job done right, have decades of combined experience, and are a great price for the value they provide. Check them out!

Communication was a 10/10!! When I first messaged Travis, he called me and went over in great detail everything we were looking for, for our wedding day and was amazing in adding some personalization that we wanted!! He was great on checking in with us throughout our reception and knew what to play to keep people on the dance floor the whole night!! We added the dancing on clouds for our first dance and it made it so much more magical!!! I wouldn’t have wanted anyone else for our wedding day!! He did an amazing job and I would recommend to anyone looking for a DJ!!

Last minute bookings can often be a cause for concern, but our experience with Image Entertainment was nothing short of exceptional! Despite the short notice, they seamlessly integrated into our outdoor event, bringing an electrifying atmosphere with their fantastic music selection and infectious energy. Their professionalism and ability to read the crowd kept everyone dancing and engaged throughout the event. We couldn't have asked for a better DJ to turn our last-minute arrangements into a memorable experience. Highly recommended

Carrie was so flexible and easy to work with. The husband and I wanted songs she didn't have on her website, but she got them for our wedding. She was energetic and kept our crowd enthusiastic and entertained.
