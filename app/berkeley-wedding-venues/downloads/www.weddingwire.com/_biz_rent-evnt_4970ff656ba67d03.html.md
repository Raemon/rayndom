Wonderful and professional!

I met Luccette and her team from a baby shower she had decorated. It was downright impressive watching Luccette and her husband haul huge backdrops through a crowded venue.   
  
She went straight to work and was extremely thorough. She didn't leave things as is for convenience; she will fix it until it's perfect.   
  
I reached out to her to decorate for a wedding reception. She kept me updated even when she was out of the country. We met up as many times as it took. She discussed her ideas with us and we shared our thoughts with her.   
  
Luccette was very professional and addressed all feedback. She was also very easy to work with and accommodated us more than we could have asked for. I had so much fun working with Luccette!!
