They did such a good job on our flowers. My bridal bouquet was absolutely gorgeous, and the table bouquets and flowers we put on the wedding arch were all so fitting and lovely. Working with Calypso Farms was also very fun, they were very kind and responsive and had us come out to the farm to discuss flower preferences, and even sent us home with an impromptu bouquet that day. If I ever need flowers again, I'll definitely be working with them.

Anchorage Floral did a fabulous job with my flowers. They were very professional and helpful. When I entered the shop I had no idea what type of flowers or style of flower arrangements I wanted for the wedding. Adrian, the owner of Anchorage Floral, was very helpful and helped me design the perfect flower plan while working within my budget. Anchorage Floral had competitive prices. I would highly recommend Anchorage Floral to all future brides and grooms.

I decided at the last minute, VERY last minute, that I did want a bouquet and boutonniere after all, but had no idea what I wanted. Somehow these lovely ladies helped me find the most gorgeous flowers that fit my personality so perfectly and made me so happy. They were also so friendly and quick. I really appreciate the staff at Bagoys, if you are in need of flowers, I can 100% recommend this place!

I had the most incredible flowers for my wedding on 9/2/17. The colors, design, variety, freshness, quality were all a 10+ rating. I was totally blown away with everything they did and it made my wedding look amazing! I had so many guests say how beautiful the flowers were! Hope and her team delivered and set up and it looked spectactular! The flowers lasted over a week after the wedding also so my family and I got to continue enjoying them way beyond what I expected. I highly recommend them.

I went to three different florists, and asked for the same exact flowers each time. First florist was over 1000, next was over 700 and Evalyn's was a fraction of the price which fit in my budget! The bouquets were gorgeous!! I'm so glad i went with Evalyn's!

Ive purchased roses and regular arrangements they all look nice and last for atleast a week most of the time longer. Prices are extremely fair especially when u see what you get. So they do the job right and the customer service is exellent. I recommend them to anybody hands down the best ive ever used . I wish i had photos sorry
