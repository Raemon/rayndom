I highly recommend 7C Venue for your upcoming event! We hosted a graduation party at 7C this spring in and it was amazing! There is a huge indoor space, which was a nice escape from the summer heat. But the outdoor spaces are fabulous! The grounds are huge, with several unique areas to utilize and space to explore and walk about. There are sunny locations with wide open spaces, shady areas with great tree cover, two patio paver areas, and a beautiful large tent. The barn and silo are picturesque, as are the farmyard chickens off to one side. Parking is abundant. The rural location is easy to access and within 15 minutes of Fargo - Moorhead. Casey, the property owner, is wonderful to work with and truly couldn’t have been more accommodating. He was welcoming and agreeable to every request we made. The pricing was affordable, and a great value compared to other venues. Check out 7C Venue for your upcoming reception or party! This beautiful venue made all of the difference in creating a fun and memorable celebration!

The Naastads are both highly professional and personable, bringing a warm family atmosphere to our special day. Everything went off without a hitch due in part to their flexibility and support. I as the bride could not have imagined a better venue at which to get married! They truly made us feel at home.

I stumbled across Lone Oak online winter of 2021; and when I saw it wasn't even built yet I scratched it off my list. However, I kept coming back to it.. in March 2021, we had scheduled 3 tours one weekend and I slipped Lone Oak in to that weekend without giving my fiance any of the details about it. He gave me a look of "wtf" when we drove in to the yard and it was just partially framed. We met with Melissa, and when we left I already knew it was the one, but we finished out all our scheduled tours and after thinking for a week we sent in our deposit on Lone Oak. For a venue that was not even finished yet they were incredible to work with, sending blueprints and photo updates right down to making a custom drink list for our big day. I would choose them time and time again, if I were an event planner, I would do whatever it took to get them on my preferred vendors list and vice-versa. If you are looking for an all-in-one venue, a place to get ready on site, a gorgeous farmhouse to stay in with your wedding party or family, a large indoor venue with a beautiful outdoor ceremony space, acres for kids to run and enjoy themselves and incredible customer service. This is the perfect venue. Regardless of the size of your wedding, Lone Oak Farm is what dreams are made of. I mean seriously a Pinterest worthy venue.

Had our wedding out here on April 15th 2023 after a near record setting winter of snow. Parking was a bit of a concern with the snow melt but the staff out at the ranch got everyone parked in the yard. The cabins for both nights were great and we received a lot of compliments on the venue. Definitely recommend going for the 2 night signature package for the convenience of having everyone out there the night before and the night after. Jay and Kari were both very helpful throughout the process. I can't comment on the available camping spots because our spring wedding turned into essentially a winter one, but they do have spots available. We held our ceremony in the Copper Jewel Barn and the set up was plenty big enough for the expected 175 guests we had. Things were readjusted from ceremony to reception pretty quickly and the dance floor had plenty of room to keep people out there all night. I would recommend the Bison Light if buying kegs for the reception, it was perceived very well by all of the light beer drinkers we had out at the wedding. They also have a few other beers that I enjoyed, even being a set in stone light beer drinker myself. It was also nice that we were able to have the first keg of the two we bought tapped in the bridal cabin the evening before for the rehearsal dinner, and then have the remainder moved to the barn for the reception the next evening. Overall were pleased with the venue and wedding and even with mother nature trying it's hardest to make things difficult, everything went well.
