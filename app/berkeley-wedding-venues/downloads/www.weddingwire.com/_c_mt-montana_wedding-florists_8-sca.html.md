Some may have called me a “bridezilla,” but I prefer visionary—and Rebecca brought my vision to LIFE. Staring in awe of her floral creations was my favorite part of the day (besides marrying the love of my life). She listened, asked questions, and truly understood what I wanted. Beyond her breathtaking talent, she was kind, encouraging, and genuinely cared. If you want a calm, generous, insanely gifted florist, I’d recommend Indigo & Violet Co. a million times over. Thank you, Rebecca

Jodi made the most amazing floral arrangements! She took my ideas and then made it better. She was also very pleasant to work with, she answered all my questions in a timely manner and was very accommodating to my needs. Her team installed everything flawlessly and she was so responsive the day off if I had any questions which made my wedding day stress free. If you're wanting beautiful floral arrangements for your wedding then Jodi is your gal.

We reached out to Melissa after seeing all the beautiful work that she has done. We were on a budget and she was able to help us figure out use flowers that would make the most impact, and how to repurpose things from the cocktail hour/ceremony for the reception later. The flowers were absolutely STUNNING and it was so wonderful to see our vision come to life. My friend has worked with many florists and was also impressed by the quality of blooms that Melissa chose to include in the arrangements. She delivered the flowers to the hotel where we were getting ready and then got everything set up at our venue so we didn't have to worry about a thing! We cannot say enough good things, she is amazing and we highly recommend her!

Karen's Floral Artistry did an amazing job with the flowers for my wedding and the great extra's at an affordable price! I do not know much about flowers but Karen was able to take my ramblings about a sort of pink and white country feel and turn it into reality with some of the most beautiful flowers I have ever seen (I still don't know their names!) She also came up with a beautiful idea for table runners that were woven together out of different ribbons and created them all for me. The tables were so unique, she is amazingly creative and I'm grateful she was my florist because I wouldn't have even known where to start! She was able to pull together some of those big balloons with the long ribbons on them with short notice to have at the wedding and they were so much fun! She took care of everything and was on time and very professional. The flowers, tables and balloons looked flawless. I would note that she is sometimes hard to get a hold of by email and you may need to follow up, but she is worth it!

Be sure to explain in as much detail as you can exactly what you want. Kelly is a wonderful help, she just needs to know what you like and she'll make it happen. She is also a great wedding planner, super flexible and always listens to the needs of her brides and their whole families.

Country Flower in Bozeman did a great job on our wedding flowers! Our centerpieces were beautiful and the bouquets were too. Mine got pretty droopy toward the middle of the day because it spent so much time out in the sun during our photos. The service was great and the owner of the business, Susan was quite flexible with our pick up time since we picked up our flowers to save money on the delivery fee. We appreciated that a lot. Overall we were very pleased with our partnership with Country Flower.
