I cannot say enough about Alisha Fox, she has been a pleasure to work with as we planned and executed our wedding event. She is knowledgeable, courteous and professional at all times. She was responsive to all my questions and was absolutely lovely in person.

This review is long overdue, but for anyone thinking of having their wedding at the Delaware Contemporary - DO IT! Meagan was a joy to work with, and was incredibly helpful in communicating with our vendors, making recommendations to fit our needs, and completely organizing day-of setup. She completely took all the stress away from us so we could enjoy our day. The venue is beautiful, the galleries are amazing, and for the price you really can't beat it. This is a great space for the DIY couples out there that want to really personalize the space to be their own. We wouldn't give booking this venue a second thought if we had to do it all over again. Thank you Meagan and DCCA! Brian & Shara - married June 2017

Alexis is an absolute saint. The museum provided the perfect setting for our wedding, providing interesting exhibits for not only the adults but also the children. Our wedding photos are AMAZING - Can you get better than cheezing beside a Tyrannosaurus Rex head? We loved every minute of it, and so did our guests. Toscana's partnering with the museum provided a very smooth operation. If we could afford it, we'd totally get married here again.

We had the MOST PERFECT August wedding thanks to everyone at Winterthur! From the very beginning of the planning process, we had nothing but a great experience with Winterthur. Miriam (Winterthur's amazing on-site coordinator) is top notch - responsive, pleasant, patient and just absolutely lovely every step of the way. The food was wonderful and our guests we able to enjoy exactly what we wanted for them - an incredible experience - from the time they arrived through the time the reception ended. :) 10 out of 10 recommend!!

With a small budget, I'm so happy we chose to marry here. Not only was the staff friendly and professional but so many of my guests thought the room just beautiful. We opted not to have any decorations other than on the tables, but we didn't need them. The room was classically beautiful as is. And the outside was gorgeous for pictures. Ample parking and outstanding acoustics made for a great party space and the huge window was great for our ceremony spot.
