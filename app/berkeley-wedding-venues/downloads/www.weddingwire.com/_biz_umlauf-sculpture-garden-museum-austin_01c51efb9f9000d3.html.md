Beautiful, unique, and a hit with guests!

We are so glad that we chose to have our wedding at the Umlauf. Amanda was such a pleasure to work with and was prompt, professional, and kind in all of our meetings and conversations. The venue itself is gorgeous and has so many fun features that made for some very unique and beautiful wedding photos. The sculptures and greenery are so vibrant in the spring that we honestly didn't feel we had to do much more dressing up of the venue ourselves! The Umlauf was extremely easy to work with and did everything to make sure the day ran smoothly and that we had a great time and could just focus on having fun on our wedding day instead of worrying about the set up or take down. Our guests loved exploring the venue during the cocktail hour and reception, too. It was the perfect location for our 100-person wedding! Also, a random side-note that you may get lucky and be visited by some gorgeous wildlife during your wedding! Herons are my favorite birds, and two showed up during our reception in a show-stopping appearance that had everyone excited!(Photos by Leah Muse Photography!)

Wonderful wedding venue!

Umlauf was a beautiful location to host our wedding. Each venue has its own peculiarities and pros and cons, so make sure you understand them before you book (the garden is open to the public during the day and going late at Umlauf is not an option, as amplified sound must be turned off at 10 PM per Austin city ordinance). You’d probably want to go with mostly preferred vendors, which is what we did. That being said, we had a wonderful experience at Umlauf. Office staff were great to work with (Amanda was always very helpful and responsive). We fit our wedding of about 50 people underneath the pagoda for dinner which was the perfect setting. The garden was pretty remarkable for our ceremony. And despite that ordinance, we were still able to host a great dance party for our guests. We highly recommend Umlauf.

Beautiful even in the cold rain! 

Amanda was amazing! Very quick to response and answer any questions we had, as well as accommodating! We were hoping to have a sunny day to be able to fully enjoy the garden, but the freezing weather and rain kicked in. The garden was still absolutely magical in the rain and I can’t wait to see our photos from the photographer! We had our reception under the terrace with a few heaters and it was still very comfortable. We were so thankful the Gallery was available to rent, as well!

The most beautiful wedding location

UMLAUF was hands down the most beautiful wedding location. Our guest raved at how perfect the garden was and how unique the sculptures were. Amanda, the venue coordinator, was extremely responsive and very helpful. I could not have imagined a more perfect spot for our wedding!

We loved having our wedding at Umlauf. It's a unique venue that you can personalize and make your own. The different levels and spaces made it feel really special. It also provides a drop-dead gorgeous back-drop for photos--the green is amazing.   
  
Worth noting that I was worried about the wedding feeling short bc of the band having to stop at 10pm, but I was totally wrong to worry about that--the length felt perfect. I think it's the case for any outdoor venue in-town, and we were really glad to be in town. The ceremony was at 6pm but guests started arriving at 5 or 5:15. We had cava served while they strolled the garden. We didn't do a format exit so we hung around a bit after the music stopped--which was fun. We sent our guests to Easy Tiger, and arrived there ourselves by 10:45 or so to an awesome after-party. We didn't have a reservation but there was room for party to fill many tables.   
  
One more tip: use the chairs they offer. A great source of savings--that looked great!

Umlauf Sculpture Gardens was an amazing venue for us to use for our wedding. We got married in February of 2017, and the weather and atmosphere was perfect. Jonathan Greiner and Ally Hinojosa were our points of contact though out the planning process. My spouse and I planned the wedding ourselves without a wedding planner, and Jonathan and Ally made the process so easy for us. They were quick about responding to our emails/ phone calls and did not seem bothered by the extensive amount of emails/phone calls we sent them. They were even great with working with our rental vendors to make sure that our tent and rentals were in the correct space (I do recommend going with their preferred vendors for the rentals...the preferred rental company is aware of all the do's and don'ts of the venue. It just helps the process run smoothly). Overall, the venue was beautiful, and my guests and I had a wonder evening.

I cannot say enough good things about the Umlauf. We recently hosted a party there for our daughter. The venue is gorgeous and the staff was incredible to work with. Our guests were mesmerized by this gem of a place in the heart of Austin. Everything went off without a hitch and we could not be more pleased!
