Farmington Historic Plantation is a gorgeous venue, even when it rains 3.48” on your wedding day! The carriage house was a perfect place to get ready and take impromptu family photos. We had so many compliments on the venue and how beautiful the pavilion was. I’d have it there again in a heartbeat!

I recently hosted a baby shower at this event space, and it was absolutely perfect! The private area made the event feel intimate and special, while the spacious seating comfortably accommodated our 70 guests with no issues at all. The kitchen was a huge plus, making it easy to set up and serve food without any hassle. The space was clean, well-maintained, and beautifully set up for our celebration. The staff was also incredibly helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. I highly recommend this venue for anyone planning a baby shower or any special gathering. It exceeded all our expectations, and we couldn’t have asked for a better experience!

If you're looking for an easy, exquisite, and convenient event space for your wedding or reception, there is no better place. My (now) husband and I looked at every venue in Southeast Missouri and some in Paducah, KY. We even looked into some of the venues in Oxford, MS (where we went to school). I don't think any venue compared to the Buckner. From top to bottom, this place impressed in every way. The food? Phenomenal. We got COUNTLESS compliments. The bar service? Fast and friendly. The three "venues within a venue" we utilized? Classy and functional. The event center staff? Friendly and easy to deal with and professional. This may sound insincere, but we got compliments on nearly every aspect of our reception at the Buckner-Ragsdale. Just to provide some insight on how much we used the venue, here's how our weekend went. Friday night we had 80 person rehearsal dinner in The Cellar on the lower level and then a welcome party with over 150 people in The Loft. Saturday, my husband and his groomsmen hung out in "The Board Room" and then we did our first look and pictures all over the venue. After the ceremony (it was somewhere else), we had a cocktail hour upstairs at The Loft. We had redecorated and reused the space both nights. We even went back into the small board room for a private dinner with just my husband and I. After the cocktail hour, we went to the main level known as The Ballroom. Let me tell you, it's one heck of a ballroom! The place was just jaw dropping. We started the dinner with two buffet lines and two bars and seating enough for everyone (plus some cocktail tables around). Did i mention we had 250 folks at the wedding? Then the live band got started and the rest was history. We also had a painter set up in the Main st window! Another hidden benefit was that the company that runs the event center also runs two hotels in town. So we used the downtown Courtyard Marriott as our official hotel (it was only a couple blocks away) and got a great rate on the room block because we were using the Buckner! Can't recommend the Buckner Ragsdale event center and it's staff enough. It was a PERFECT weekend!

The venue is beautiful and historic. Even though you are locked in to their vendor for catering, everyone we talked to had nothing but great things to say about Bayou Bluegrass's catering. Our DJ who had done many many weddings at their venues said he had never had a bad meal from them - and they definitely lived up to the expectations set by everyone! The food was great, the catering staff were wonderful and friendly. The only complaint we could make is that the signature drinks we picked tasted quite different from the ones we had at the tasting event, but they were still good. Also, not a complaint, but the floor is rough and similar to a concrete tennis court surface which is great for traction but also can be rough on shoes during dancing, so keep that in mind when selecting shoes for the event! Allison helped us with planning and helped us work out all the details. Helaina was our on site manager for the event, and she was equally amazing.

This is an old tavern/roadhouse on the public square in Bardstown. We had our dinner in a private room on the second floor- perhaps not as nice as the main dining rooms, but a good choice for this group. Menu was Kentucky favorites. Very good service. Not at all elegant- just down-home.

I fell in love with The Henry Clay as soon as I walked into the Beaux Arts Ballroom. I knew right then and there that this was the room I wanted to get married in. The elegant restored 1920's architecture was gorgeous! Our wedding was a gothic Victorian theme and the building went perfectly with the dark elegant ambiance I was planning. And the venue as basically a one stop shop between the venue, the Hilton Garden Inn, and 8UP Catering, they are all under the same owner company (First Hospitality). I will be speaking on both The Clay and 8UP in this review because they are under the same parent company and I worked with Ally (with The Clay) and Apollo (with 8UP) interchangabley throughout the months of planning and Apollo didn't start working for First Hospitality until a few months before the wedding. I will also review 8UP separately. I loved that we got the entire floor and a huge bridal suite to get ready in. This was a huge selling point that not many other venues in Louisville or the surrounding areas have. There was more than enough room for myself, 5 bridesmaids, 4 mom's and grandma's, a few friends, 3 hair stylists, and 2 makeup artists to work and us all get ready without feeling claustrophobic! That's impressive! Not to mention the full kitchen and full bathroom in there as well. The guys had the Tavern Room and a board room to get ready and hang out in. There is also an open air courtyard, The Billiards Room, a second board room, and a separate set bathrooms for guests on the 4th floor. The breakfast was complimentary and was catered in by 8UP, that was also a huge perk bc we definitely needed to eat! Day of logistics were a little crazy, there were some things that were supposed to be taken care of by the caterers that were not, like they were supposed to put on the chair covers but the guys and our family ended up putting all those on which took a ton of time away from them being able to set other decor up. We were told to have the covers at the venue at 10am and they would be taken care of, but they were there well before that time and no one from the building came to put them on. We had 8UP do our rehearsal dinner upstairs at the restaurant and they did wonderful for that. Great ambiance, plenty of food, and we took home the leftovers which was nice. They also catered the reception with an open bar as well. We did received a $500 discount off our catering bill because we did all of our food through 8UP. On the wedding day, we had cocktail hour in The Tavern Room while the Beaux Arts room was being flipped for the reception. There was supposed to be a bar set up in the Traven before guests started coming in after the ceremony, but it apparently didn't get set up until our groomsmen's wife tracked someone down and made them set it up. I didn't know that until weeks later, which was annoying since the liquor was paid for by us. The food for the reception was set up in the Billiards Room and a second bar was set up in the Beaux Arts room for the reception. We paid extra for a "signature cocktail" at the bar that was a bourbon Manhattan. It was unfortunately mixed so strong no one could drink it, so that was a huge waste of money. We paid for 80 people to eat and maybe 55 people were actually there including the DJ, 2 photographers, and a videographer to eat and they ran out of food. I was told later that guests went back for seconds and there was only salad left. We had 2 meats, 2 vegetables, and salad; that seemed like a lot of food! If it was supposed to feed 80 people and that many did not show up. What if 80 people had actually shown up to eat?? Would some of my guests gone hungry? I would have been pretty furious because the food we picked weren't things that could just be whipped up real quick. Now don't get me wrong, the food was delicious! The short ribs were to die for! Everyone still talks about how good everything was, but we were super close to running out of food which was not ok. Now I didn't find out about a lot of this until later, from a bride's perspective everything went smoothly minus our signature cocktail being undrinkable. Generally, overall, we had a great experience having our wedding at The Henry Clay. Things are bound to go wrong on your wedding day and mine was no exception. I did exactly what I wanted to do and that was have the day with my girls in a huge, lovely bridal suite getting all beautiful. I got to literally see my vision, dreams, and all my hard work come to life! It was gorgeous! And I got to marry the man of my dreams in a beautiful, historic venue. There were hiccups along the way, but that's to be expected. I would still recommend The Henry Clay and First Hospitality for your wedding needs.

The beauty and affordability of this place won me over. We used the property and their barn space for the ceremony and the reception. They were easy to work with and made the space very accessible for the whole weekend for set up/take down

I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Tena and her staff! The Grand is absolutely beautiful, and they take care of every detail! I really could not imagine a better experience for the price! Tena also did the floral arrangements for our wedding which were breathtaking! So many of our guests commented that our wedding reception was the most beautiful they have ever attended!

ArtsPlace was the perfect choice for my daughter's wedding reception. The downtown location provided convenience to our hotel and the gallery exhibit contributed to creating a sophisticated atmosphere that was just plain FUN! The coordinator was pleasant to work with and the space was conducive to both dancing and conversation. We had a great time and heard nothing but compliments all evening!
