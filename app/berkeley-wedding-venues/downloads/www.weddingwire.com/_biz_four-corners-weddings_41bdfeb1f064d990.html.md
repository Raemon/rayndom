## About this vendor

![Jake A Schuchardt](https://cdn0.weddingwire.com/vendor/715520/original/960/jpg/uo_1025517_c1b46dfe-f1b9-4d76-aa0e-f602506c5ccd.jpeg?r=1726471817)

#####  Jake A Schuchardt 

Owner 

__13 years in business

__We speak English

__Small team (2-10 members)

Personal, fun, and a reflection of you as individuals and as a couple. That is what your ceremony should look like! It is my job to ask all the right questions so I can make the sure the ceremony is exactly what you imagined. I take your feedback with my experience and wisdom and combine them into a one-of-a-kind ceremony!

  
**My Story**

  
It all started as a favor for a friend. I played college baseball in Denver and after college I had a close friend and teammate who wanted me to marry him and his wife in a small outdoor ceremony in California. I was working as a pastor and baseball and softball coach, but have never performed a wedding. Through weeks of preparation and practice, the wedding went off without a hitch and they are still married to this day. Fast forward to today, I continue to perform weddings for religious and non-religious couples alike. I love seeing two people come together as one and want to make your ceremony as stress-free and painless as possible!  
  


**Services Offered**

Jake will prioritize the development of a genuine connection with each couple, building a knowledge of their core values and beliefs. He services a variety of wedding events such as non-religious occasions, vow renewal ceremonies, interfaith events, and more. In addition to pre-marital counseling sessions, he is willing to assist with the writing of your wedding vows if you so desire. Work with some of the best in the wedding business and ensure your big day is exactly how your dreamed!

Best Officiant Ever 

You won’t regret your decision if you choose Jake to be your officiant! Jake was hands down the best! We couldn’t have asked for a better person to marry us. I can’t tell you how many people came up to me afterward and complimented the ceremony or asked if he was related to one of us. He took the time to get to know us prior to the ceremony which made the ceremony that much better and made it seem like he was family to us and knew us both our whole lives. Would highly recommend him! My one cousin even asked for his information, because she wants to use him to renew her and her husbands vows. He was just an all around great, fun, cheerful guy and helped calm Henry and I’s nerves and was by our sides every step of the way.   
Thank you so much, Jake for everything you did to make our wedding day everything we every imagined and more!

The best!!! 

Jake was our officiant for our October wedding. We had the best experience working with him! Our wedding ceremony was absolutely perfect, and he made sure everything ran smoothly. Jake was easy to work with, flexible with our schedules, and very attentive to make sure all the needed details for the ceremony were planned out. I would definitely recommend four corners weddings to anyone and everyone looking for an officiant for their wedding or a few premarital counseling sessions. Our sessions with Jake were definitely insightful and individualized to our relationship. 10/10 stars!!!!

Hire Jake. You will not regret it! 

Jake did an AMAZING job with officiating our wedding. He took the time to get to know us as individuals and personalized our ceremony to our wants and desires. He helped guide us on picking what was important to us on our special day to be included in the ceremony. One of the best decisions we made during the wedding planning process was booking Four Corner's Weddings. We also received several compliments from our guests on Jake's ceremony service and he made it feel like we have known him for years!

Wonderful Experience!

Jake did an amazing job as our wedding officiant. He took time to get to know us as a couple and incorporated our story so well into the ceremony with just the right amount of humor. We received so many compliments after. Jake was helpful throughout the planning process offering advice and tips on things we would not have considered otherwise. Thank you, Jake, for helping to make our day one we will remember forever! We could not be happier with our decision. So happy we found you!
