We loved working with DJ Dayoh! He kept the energy high, the dance floor full, and made our wedding in Turks and Caicos so much fun. Not only is a great DJ, but was wonderful to work with when planning a destination wedding - excellent communication and great suggestions. Highly recommend him to anyone looking for an amazing DJ!

William John was the DJ for our recent wedding on Grace Bay. There were really only two things that mattered to me for that day - my loved ones and the music. William John killed it! I was blown away. I had never met him but he came highly recommended by our wedding planner (Tropical Destination Management). Not only did he reach out to us ahead of the wedding with a list of questions, he also provided us a sample playlist ahead of time to ensure the reception music was exactly what we wanted. We had so many guests come up to us afterward and gush how incredible our DJ was. All 65 guests were on the dance floor for hours dancing under a full moon and twinkle lights. It was incredible. The area that gave me the most heartburn was the music for our ceremony. William John downloaded all of the specific music and played and faded it perfectly at every pass. I would highly recommend him for your event and I will hire him for future events on island!

We had a last minute change in DJ a week before our wedding and we couldn't be happier with Mike and his team! We scheduled our meeting/walk through two days before our event and Mike was very professional and I felt very confident with him. We provided a music playlist for the ceremony and reception and they were very accommodating and we danced the night away with our loved ones. I highly recommend Prime DJs!
