Party in the Suite

We stayed at Pullman the night before our wedding. When we first booke the hotel, we didn't know that it was dog-friendly. We last-minute decided to add our pup to our wedding and was pleasantly surprised when we realized that it was a dog-friendly hotel!   
  
The bridal party had two rooms (the boys got a smaller room) and we requested that they be close to each other, but we all spent most of our time in the suite. We had a great time together. The suite was spacious enough for us to do all our hair and makeup there. It was also super beautiful and a great backdrop for our preparation pictures.   
  
There were also two weddings going on downstairs. We could hear and see bits and pieces of it. It looked amazing!

We have the room booked for the wedding date. The morning we had a traditional tea ceremony here. The hotel provided all the service need for us. They even free upgrade us to the bigger room so we have more space for the guess. When we get back to the hotel at night. They have prepared champagne and strawberry chocolate for us. Very sweet! I am very enjoying the time we stay. All my relatives and friends said the hotel is very pretty.

Pullman SF Bay is a phenomenal place for a traditional Indian wedding. We had out wedding here a few weeks ago and could not have been happier with the entire process. Stephanie (Director of Catering and Conference Services) went above and beyond in order to make our wedding as amazing as it was. Their outdoor dock overlooking the water is beautiful for a ceremony. It is comfortable for 200 guests and a large mandap. The banquet hall was spacious, revamped with new carpets, well lite, clean and all around perfect for a reception. It never felt crowded with 300 guests, a dance floor, buffet stands, a bar and an area of entertainment vendors.   
The accommodations within the hotel are 5 star. The suites are spacious, comfortable and well set up.   
Working with the Pullman and Stephanie was an experience unlike any other, it was smooth and easy. Stephanie was responsive to all emails, requests, questions and concerns we had. She went out of her way to make sure we could do all the traditional rituals (sehra bandi, baraat, phere, etc). They allowed our caterers space to set up their work area, allowed the decorator ample time to set everything up, arranged for parking, water, signage etc for all guests. Working with Stephanie and the entire Pullman staff was a flawless effort. They never once shut down any ideas we had, they held meetings to go over all the plan, they met with all our vendors to ensure there were no issues the day of the event and by the end of the entire planning process, we all felt like nothing could go wrong.   
Do not hesitate to have you upcoming wedding here, it is a venue with a beautiful outdoor dock, a staff that is professional, polite and easy to work with and a set up that really caters towards all ethnic weddings!

This hotel is BEAUTIFUL and trendy! We loved it when we first set foot inside this French Hotel. Our catering manager was also very outgoing and attentive to all our needs. The food for our reception was also very delicious- small portions but nonetheless mouthwatering selections. We couldn't have chosen a better venue than Hotel Sofitel.

Ava was very patient with us and did her best to accommodate our requests. However, on our wedding day, we felt rushed during dinner, and the presentation of the appetizers had been minimized and the sorbet flavor was not the one we had picked, which was very upsetting. We advised Sofitel afterwards and they kindly refunded us some of the money.  
  
My husband and I loved the hotel because of its modern look. We like to go there for dinner - the food is excellent!

This place seems to book up fast during wedding season. I booked a reception here and the coordinator was very helpful, she's the sweetest! The decor and overall ambiance of this place is very nice and classy and doesn't require a lot in terms of additional decoration. This place does not provide any AV or lighting so you need to bring all that in yourself. The filet mignon here is delish!

My reception was gorgeous. Sofitel and Ava were very accommodating and saw to it that the event operated smoothly. Although a pricey venue, the decor, location and accommodations were ideal.

Wedding/reception

My husband and I got married at pullman redwood shores 4/20/19. We worked with Deborah and she was very nice and extremely accommodating. The room block was also nicely done and very easy for both sides. We really appreciated that. That being said, planning our wedding with this venue was so difficult. Everytime we asked for a change or revision in our plans( i.e. size of dance floor, table arrangements, guest count breakdown) we would have to communicate back and forth at least three times to get it right. Even after the revision was made an error would somehow show up the next time we talked about it. this was extremely frustrating from our end as we couldn't see why so many mistakes were being made. We ended up hiring a private day of coordinator to help us through this. Second, on the day of my wedding, I was put in a dark dusty stairwell/closet type of room with tons of spiders...while I was in my wedding dress waiting to walk down the aisle. The least they could have done was clean it. Third, after cocktail hour at our reception they informed us that our bar tab was at 6 k after only one hour. Our crowd consisted of relatively light/moderate drinkers. Everyone I spoke to said that that number seemed impossible. We had hired a private event coordinator that day who has done hundreds of Indian weddings like ours and she said usually after cocktail hour with a crowd like ours the tab would be at most 3k. We authorized more money at the bar in order to keep the festivities going but when we asked for an itemized list of which drinks were ordered they said they could not release that information. We feel very ripped off and distrustful of this incident. Fourth, we brought our own wine to be served. Halfway through the reception they said they ran out of our wine (we brought 72 bottles). We looked around the room and noticed they poured every glass to the rim in order to use up our wine. The next day we found one case of our wine at the lobby front desk that was unused. Very unorganized and very unfair. Fifth, we had requested five high chairs for our friends with toddlers and had clearly marked which tables they should be at. I had confirmed twice to make sure they would be placed. At the reception, none of the high chairs were placed. While the staff was all pleasant and nice and the hotel is clean and aesthetically pleasing, quality of service and professionalism was poor and we were extremely stressed out during our reception.

Horrible Experience

So many issues with this hotel and attempting to plan an engagement/wedding. Here are the major issues:   
1\. The staff turned over 3x in a span of 6 months since we signed the contract. No one ever transitioned anything. It was completely dysfunctional.   
2\. We negotiated a room block for the wedding and as the date got closer the rate dropped below our negotiated rate. When called to ask to update it they refused. It took a few back and forths and again 5 different people had to get involved all saying it wasn't their job to get anything done. Finally, they dropped the rate. The next issue was they kept telling guests who were booking the rooms that the old rate was still in place.   
3\. At the time of guests checking in they were supposed to give bags and the front desk staff couldn't remember the basics of handing a bag to anyone under the room block.   
4\. We also told the front desk that some guests rooms they could charge to the house account -- they still proceeded to charge our guests  
5\. When going through the final walkthrough for the events (this happened two hours before the start of one of our events) they were still gathering materials.  
6\. We had an outside chef come in that was told they could use the kitchen and when they showed up the staff refused their entry to the kitchen.   
  
The list goes on, the GM of the property was involved weeks before since nothing was being done I had to cold call him to get involved. Figuring that would ensure his support that day, but no he was gone from the property that weekend.   
  
Super disorganized and no flexibility. I completely regret doing any events here. Our decorator and others warned us and we should've listened.
