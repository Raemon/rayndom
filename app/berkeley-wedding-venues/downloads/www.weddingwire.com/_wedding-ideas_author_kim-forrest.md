# Kim Forrest

Senior Editor




Kim Forrest has been writing about weddings for over a decade, specializing in etiquette and planning advice. Kim writes and edits much of the content you’ll read on WeddingWire, and also manages our team of freelance writers. Kim’s love of the wedding space first blossomed when she was an assistant editor at Washingtonian magazine in the mid-2000s (her first wedding-related article was about a hot new trend—destination weddings!). She became WeddingWire’s first full-time editor in 2012. Kim is originally from Long Island, New York and currently lives in Bethesda, Maryland with her husband and two children. She loves baking, yoga, ballet, theater, trying out the latest skincare fads, and listening to podcasts on a variety of random topics. 

## Experience

Kim spent over five years at Conde Nast’s _Brides Local_ magazines and Brides.com in New York, starting as an assistant editor and then associate fashion editor. She managed the magazine’s fashion department, served as lead local editor for five local publications in Boston, Houston, Washington, DC, Atlanta, and Northern New Jersey, and wrote and coordinated fashion coverage on Brides.com. She also coordinated fashion photo shoots and became a pro at carrying multiple wedding dresses at one time. After her time at Conde Nast, Kim moved to the Washington, DC area and rejoined _Washingtonian_ magazine as their associate bridal editor, writing and editing for both their wedding blog and print publication, _Washingtonian Weddings_. 

Kim began her career as a fact-checker at several publications, including Washingtonian magazine and Martha Stewart’s late, great magazine, _Blueprint_. She also worked as a production assistant at MSNBC. 

## Education

Kim attended Williams College in the bucolic purple mountains of the Berkshires, Massachusetts. At Williams, Kim majored in English, performed improv comedy, gave tours to prospective students, and wrote for the college’s weekly newspaper, the Williams Record. During college, Kim interned at News _12 Long Island_ and _Good Morning America_ , where she produced national television segments and woke up very, very early in the morning. She also spent a semester studying at Boston University’s Washington Journalism Center in Washington, DC, where she covered Capitol Hill for _The Keene Sentinel_ and interned at Hearst-Argyle Television. 

Kim later attended the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, receiving a Masters of Science with a concentration in magazine journalism. She was a section chief for the _New York Review of Magazines_. 

## Accolades

Kim appeared on [The Big Wedding Planning Podcast](http://weddingplanning.fireside.fm/guests/kim-forrest) to discuss wedding trends. Kim wrote an article for _The Huffington Post_ titled [“8 Things You Shouldn't Skimp On For Your Wedding.”](http://www.huffpost.com/entry/wedding-planning_n_5374630) Kim has appeared as an expert on WJLA television in Washington, DC, in segments about Halloween weddings and summer guest attire. In 2015, Kim was a featured speaker at the WeddingWire World conference. Kim was quoted in the _Washington Post_ in [an article about wedding budgeting](http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/wedding-budgeting-splurging-vs-saving/2013/01/04/825f1600-55c4-11e2-a613-ec8d394535c6_gallery.html). Kim has been featured as a wedding expert in several _New York Times_ articles, including a piece about [charitable favors](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/fashion/weddings/heartfelt-donations-replace-wedding-party-favors.html). In 2019, Kim was interviewed for an _Insider_ article about [popular first dance songs](http://static.insider.com/most-popular-wedding-first-dance-songs-2019-11/#the-type-of-song-couples-select-for-their-first-dance-has-changed-over-time-country-is-the-most-popular-genre-today-2). Kim was featured in a _Bustle_ article to promote the [Official Day Without Wedding Planning in 2016](http://www.bustle.com/articles/159502-this-one-wedding-planning-tip-will-save-you-so-much-stress). Kim shared her expertise on wedding traditions and history in Refinery 29’s article [_The Surprising History Behind The Most Popular Wedding Traditions_](http://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wedding-traditions-superstitions-meaning). 

## WeddingWire Q&A with Kim

### What is your ideal wedding style?

I got married in 2010 in my parents’ backyard in New York, and the theme was “modern garden party.” Bird motifs were all the rage at the time, and we had birds on everything, from the invitations to the coasters. Even our escort cards were tiny quail eggs in mini birds’ nests. And you know what? I would totally do it again! Fun fact: My daughter is terrified of birds. 

### Dream honeymoon location?

My husband and I went to Anguilla for our honeymoon, and it was pretty darn dreamy. Right now, I’d love to spend a week on a ranch in Montana or on a Hawaiian beach. 

### What was (or would be) your first dance song?

At my wedding, our first dance song was “Happy Together” by The Turtles—and yes, we totally broke out some choreographed dance moves. We didn’t want a song that was too slow or sappy, and this felt sweet, upbeat, and still romantic. 

### Favorite celebrity wedding look?

This is a hard one! At the moment, I’m obsessed with Zoë Kravitz’s tea-length Alexander Wang dress. It was so unexpected and charming, and she looked absolutely radiant.
