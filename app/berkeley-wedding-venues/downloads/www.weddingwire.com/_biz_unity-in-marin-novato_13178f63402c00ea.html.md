Dream Come True! 

My husband and I were elated to find Unity in Marin! We got married April 22, 2023 and the events and facility manager Ms. Debbie Sweeney Puma was such a joy to work with!! Her and my wedding coordinator got along so well! The venue was absolutely beautiful and fit our theme well which was enchanted garden. I recommend this place if you’re looking to do your weddings in your thing fit that nature look. They have a beautiful fountain where our ceremony took place and they are sanctuary was where we hosted our reception. I miss this place so much! I know if I ever came back to visit I would cry leaving. ❤️
