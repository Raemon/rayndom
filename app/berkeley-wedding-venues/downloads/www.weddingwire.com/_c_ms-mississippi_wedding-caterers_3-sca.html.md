A really good place to have a reception for a beach wedding. Everyone loved the food and the drinks. Not the ideal place if you're having a larger wedding because the banquet room is small. You would want to keep your guest list at about 150 or less. Still, a beautiful venue and the staff was great and accommodating.

Chuck and the Chardon Catering Team did a phenomenal job. From the initial meeting, to the taste test and the day of the wedding, the food options was superb for an excellent price. My family is STILL raving about the shrimp and grits. As a result, my husband and I have continued to utilize their services for personal meals and family events after the wedding. Thanks for everything Chuck! Briana & Donny 04.08.17
