We had an excellent experience with Kristina, Mayya and Abby and the rest of Princess Wedding Co. team. Mayya, our photographer was amazing and put the entire wedding party at ease. Dr Doug, our officiant do a great job with the ceremony and included everything we asked for. They helped make our Wedding Day the best day ever. I highly recommend.

The team at EOAB is truly fantastic! They are very personable and want to make sure the couple feels heard and valued. The quoting process for their Wedding in a Box package was admittedly a bit frustrating in the beginning since they offer package pricing instead of itemized pricing. This made it a bit tricky to make informed decisions about what to include/exclude. HOWEVER, once I started working with my planner(s), they were truly amazing and so helpful. I experienced a unique situation where my planner shifted about 1-2 months prior to my wedding due to an unexpected internal change (not their fault at all). Though I was a bit nervous about this transition, EOAB did a fantastic job to make sure I was taken care of through the entire transition and eased into the handoff gradually. For example, both planners attended my pre-wedding walk-through meeting, and I was SO grateful for their time. Daniella and Allison (my planners) were so thorough, patient, and communicative with me throughout the entire process (and I ask a LOT of detailed questions), and I am so incredibly grateful for their support. They truly made me feel so supported, reassured, non-judged, and so much more!

RW Style has a great selection of inventory to choose from and Tamuel is nice and quick to respond to inquiries. Thanks to them, our wedding was unique and the disco vibe we had dreamt of!

We had the pleasure of working with Megan from The Wedding Authority as our day-of coordinator and I cannot sing her praises enough! Her attention to detail, forethought, and level of organization blew us all away, including my other vendors! They all were impressed with the detailed schedule she prepared and the level of communication she had with them. I truly appreciated this because this allowed us to relax and focus on other things, while she kept things flowing. She really helped us out by also allowing us to drop off decor items to her ahead of the big day, so we could travel to the venue lighter. She was so friendly, personable, helpful, everything one could ask for in a planner! Absolutely no complaints! Very grateful to have had her! Megan is amazing!

I worked with Renata from WI and without ever being in Key West, they were amazing!!! I had a lot of issues outside of wedding planning that made things difficult but had the most beautiful wedding I could never imagine. Our dog was able to be an active part of our wedding, decisions were easy to make, when I found out most of my family couldn’t make it, she worked with me on last minute changes. I’m not a princess, never did prom or graduation but for a moment felt like a princess. We forgot the easel for his mom’s picture, she was prepared and had a beautiful stand for his mom’s picture. Diane was great too! Worked with me and understood the chaos that I had been dealing with, her words really did fit us and though she just met us made the ceremony feel tailored to us. Can’t wait to see the official pictures and have been bragging about weddings to go the whole road trip back from the keys to WI. According to my husband, I usually don’t say anything good and it’s on our video, he asked if it met my expectations, I said no and the video ends. They exceeded my expectations, made our wedding beautiful and made me forget about the chaos, drama, hurt just during the past year. I could not have imagined our wedding this amazing!!! Thank you so very much for such an amazing wedding!!! Another tourist took some pics and asked to send them to us, they thought it was “too beautiful to not too!” So this isn’t from Renata but I couldn’t wait to post, if you’re looking at them, just do it, it will be amazing and the most easiest part of getting married!

We were referred to Jackie by our venue (the Vinoy) for a 300 person three-day Indian wedding. Right away, we were so impressed by Jackie's easy communication style, knowledge/industry contacts and her calm but confident "you can do this!" attitude. Throughout the process, Jackie made herself available at all hours (we live on the west coast so we’re on different time zones) and helped us to navigate decisions with many involved family members. She was always up to help us with special requests (i.e., where can we find a pedicab for the groom to enter on) and gave us her honest/blunt take when we needed to hear it. It was clear from our other vendors that Jackie is a force to be reckoned with in the Tampa Bay wedding industry and will always go to bat for her clients. She helped keep me, my fiancé and my mom calm throughout and was a critical part of our wedding planning team. Our big fat Indian wedding went off without a hitch and we have Jackie to thank for it. We love you, Jackie and thank you for everything!!

I had the pleasure of working alongside Sydney and the Forever I Do Weddings team for Doris and Randy’s big day, and I can honestly say—they were nothing short of amazing! As part of the entertainment team, I witnessed firsthand how attentive, organized, and thoughtful they were from start to finish. Sydney was on top of every detail while still being warm, fun, and a joy to work with. The entire planning team went above and beyond to make sure the day ran smoothly and beautifully. I highly recommend Forever I Do Weddings for anyone looking to have a stress-free, memorable event. Top-tier service and an even better vibe!

Our wedding weekend was absolutely PERFECT thanks to Emma and the First Coast Weddings & Events team!!! From the moment we hired Emma, we knew that she was going to do everything to help us through the planning process, preparing for the weekend, and ensuring everything ran as smoothly as possible for the day of the wedding! Her attention to detail, informative follow ups, and industry expertise were exactly what we needed to help us manage the intricacies and overwhelm of the wedding planning process! She was an absolute life saver for us over the many hiccups we faced along the way, and I couldn't be more grateful for her support, enthusiasm, and optimism that everything would work out the way he hoped it would - in fact, the weekend turned out better than we could have ever imagined because of Emma and the entire FCWE team! 🩵 We are now blessed with a lifetime of incredible memories thanks to this amazing company!
