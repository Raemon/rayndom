I can't believe how beautiful Wickie's painting turned out. Wickie was so easy to work with. She took each photo, including multiple photos of the bridal bouquet, and many photos of the wedding day itself, including the bride, venue and other wedding details, and created such a meaningful gift for a special couple. This is a gift that they can hang in their home forever to remember their special day. I enjoyed the entire process, from when I first reached out to Wickie to the day when I received her beautiful print! Wickie is a pleasure to work with, and I will definitely do this again for future weddings. Her talent is incredible, and her knowledge of every flower, incredible. I am thrilled!

I ordered a card box for our daughters wedding, and it was just what I hoped it would be. Carol was so eager to work with me, and we were able to design the card box with the wedding dress for inspiration. It matched perfectly, and added just one more layer of elagance to our already beautiful day. Carol was prompt in responding, and was able to suggest ideas that worked perfectly for our special day. Money well spent, and I would not hesitate to do it all over again just the same way. Excellant vender, and a very well made product.

Laserkrafts did my aunt and uncle’s wedding favors several years ago that were of the covered bridge in Jackson that they were married near. When contemplating the favors we wanted, we polled our friends and family and came up with either edibles or an ornament. We got the state of NH cut out of wood with a cutout that shows the Old Man in the Mountain and the year. They started by giving us a few samples in a few configurations that we picked from. They were very affordable, supplied with ribbon, and were done very quickly and of high

I got in touch with Private Label Specialties a few weeks before my wedding...I wanted to use them for custom label sodas and water for the reception, as well as for bags, sweatshirts and doggie tee's for gifts. Throughout the entire ordering process, they were so easy to communicate with. When one item wasn't available, they found a fantastic alternative, proofs came quickly and communicating changes were simple. When the items were ready to pick up, they were incredibly flexible on when I could get them and how I paid.
