## Selecting Your Wedding Hair and Makeup

With so many styles out there, along with your own unique ideas, picking the perfect wedding hair and makeup is not always as simple as some might believe. Fortunately, professional hair stylists and wedding makeup artists can help you look and feel your best when tying the knot. They will also ensure that your hair and makeup stay put whether you’re posing for photos or dancing the night away.

When looking for beauty inspiration, check out our [wedding hair and makeup articles](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/health-beauty--t5 "Health & Beauty"). These provide a great deal of information about picking the best wedding hair stylist and wedding makeup artist. Expert stylists generally advise selecting three to five photos to work from. They also recommend that brides be open to their suggestions. After all, hair and makeup professionals know what they are doing and will be able to make you look and feel amazing on your special day. 

## Wedding Hairstyle Possibilities

There are a number of things to consider when looking for wedding hair inspiration. Most importantly, the type of hair you have is a key factor. People often fall in love with a hairstyle on another person who has completely different hair texture, length, density or color. If you have short hair, for example, you probably can’t arrange an extravagant up-do – although you could always consider [hair extensions](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-hair-extensions "Here’s Why You Should Consider Wedding Hair Extensions").

Another thing to keep in mind is the style [wedding dress](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/dresses "Wedding Dress Photos") you’ll wear, since most brides want their hairstyle to compliment their gown. Some winning combinations include a tousled side pony paired with a sweetheart neckline or a high textured bun to enrich your halter neckline – but the possibilities are endless. Check out these [bridal hair and neckline ideas](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-dress-necklines "All the Wedding Dress Necklines You Need to Know").

## Wedding Makeup Options

While makeup trends come and go, your wedding photos will last forever. Working with a wedding makeup artist to create a beautiful look that you’ll feel confident about for years to come is well worth the investment. When it comes to planning your makeup, you might want to meet with a wedding makeup artist early on. They can provide you with helpful health and beauty tips designed to manage your skin care in the months, weeks and days leading up to your wedding. Then, once you’ve nailed down your [preferred makeup looks](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-select-your-wedding-makeup-style "How to Choose Your Wedding Makeup Look"), you can schedule a trial run with your selected vendor. Or, go ahead and try out more than one wedding makeup artist!

Because there are now beauty apps that allow you to virtually try on makeup looks from your smartphone, you can also save time – and money – while experimenting from the comfort of home.

If you're the kind of bride who doesn't often go to the salon, doesn't have a favorite stylist or you are getting married out of town, we have plenty of resources for wedding hair and wedding makeup artists across the country. Simply enter your wedding location, scan through the results, and read reviews from real couples about their experiences.

Be sure to add your wedding hair stylist and wedding makeup artist to our [Wedding Vendor Manager](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/vendor-manager.html "Wedding Vendor Manager Tool") planning tool.
