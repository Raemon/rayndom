Marie Buch, who I corresponded with throughout the whole process, was extremely easy to work with. She promptly responded to any and all questions we had and reassured us every step of the way. Super happy with our experience overall. Thank you for making our special day free of stress and concern! I don't plan to get married again, but if I did I would definitely go through Maverick again!

Are you looking for a wedding venue to host your special day? Your search needs to end here. We just got married at The Secret Garden on 9/21 and I - and my guests! -cannot stop raving about how absolutely magical it was! Seriously, The Secret Garden takes care of just about everything inclusive in the price.... and they do it SO WELL. We looked at so many venues that "included everything" in their pre-built packages...including stock centerpieces with fake flowers, mediocre food options, lackluster decor, and rushing you out for the next event... not this place! Cheryl and the team will listen to your vision and every request and execute it beyond perfection. I didn't have to coordinate with dozens of vendors; The Secret Garden took care of it all. They arrange everything from delicious food to beautiful florals, a vibrant, friendly officiant to yummy cake, an awesome, engaging DJ, photography (we actually put the photography credit towards videography from the same studio, which was a great option), gorgeous centerpieces, and just about everything in between. They host one event per day and you have acres of sprawling space under twinkling bistro lights all to yourself- it's truly beautiful and you can tell the entire team cares about making magic. I will always adore this powerhouse team and beautiful venue and continuously sing their praises because I truly believe they love and care about what they do. Thank you guys!

We went to the nelson ghost town venue not wanting the typical tacky vegas chapels up and down the strip. We were generally satisfied with the experience, getting the $1,999 package. Limo bus was modern and comfortable. We LOVED the old town vintage western theme, chalked full of rusty cars and signs. Wedding officiant lady was very sweat, though did stumble a few times reading the service. The photographer/limo driver looked to know what he was doing taking nice pictures. He was all business, hurrying us from picture to picture and could have been more personable.

Our ceremony location was absolutely beautiful and everything we could have hoped for. The setting created the perfect backdrop for our vows, and the entire experience was seamless from start to finish. Everything was set up on time, the music was included and perfectly timed, and it made the day feel effortless for us and our guests. The location was also easy for everyone to find and access, which made a big difference for out-of-town friends and family. We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect place to say “I do.”

We had a Halloween wedding and what better place to bury the past and start a new marriage than an old cemetery. So we went thru the Comstock Cemetery Foundation of Virginia City and had our wedding in the old cemetery of Virginia City at sunset. Working with the Foundation was fantastic. We were able to pick the exact location that we wanted within the entire 30 acres of the cemetery. We were also able to decorate the site to the best of our ablity without disturbing the area too much. This is an old historical site afterall, so we didn't want to go moving things around, and we weren't able to have any burning candles, but we could have battery operated candles - whichi was totally fine with us. We would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants something a little on the strange and unusual side. It was a blast and the pics only speak for themselves.

We had our wedding at Dancing Pines on 9/3/22. Beyond the obvious natural beauty of the property, it is truly hard to overstate how incredible Liz and her team were; in particular her organization, professionalism, and day-of coordination were superb. My now-wife and I both cared a lot about the "flow" of the event (i.e., making sure guests were never confused about what was happening, where to go, or when their next food or drink was available). As both venue owner and wedding day coordinator, Liz is uniquely knowledgeable about the property and WOW did she help us bring our vision to life. She knew to ask questions about ceremony and reception aspects that we hadn't even considered and were so glad to be working with such a pro throughout the process since we hadn't hired a separate wedding planner. On top of all of the amazing professional service Liz and her team provided, she's just great to work with in general. As soon as we arrived on the property, it felt like we were talking to an old friend. As soon as our guests started arriving they constantly kept coming up to us and asked, "How did you find this place..." in the best way possible. Dancing Pines really is a magical place and I have to pinch myself to think that it's now part of our story and are welcome back anytime. If you have the opportunity to plan your wedding here, DO IT. You will not regret it.
