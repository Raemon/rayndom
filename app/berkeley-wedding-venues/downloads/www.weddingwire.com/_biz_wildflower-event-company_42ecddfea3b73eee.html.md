Exceptional Wedding Coordinator – Highly Recommend Jess with Wildflower Event Company 

Jess with Wildflower Event Company was truly the best wedding coordinator I could have hoped for. I genuinely could not have done this without her extensive knowledge, guidance, and support. She was stellar throughout the entire planning process, with clear, consistent communication and incredible attention to detail. Jess thought of everything—so many things I would never have even considered—which made the entire experience smooth and stress-free. I give Jess and Wildflower Event Company my highest recommendation and ratings. If you are looking for a coordinator who is organized, professional, and truly invested in your event, Jess is exceptional.
