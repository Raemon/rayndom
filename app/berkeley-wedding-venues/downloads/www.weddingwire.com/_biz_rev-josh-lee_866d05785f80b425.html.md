The best wedding decision we made. 

Josh was great throughout the entire process from beginning to end. We originally met him at a wedding expo in Boise and we had the best conversation. When we finished talking and walked away my wife and I looked at each other and we knew we would love to have him. Josh was there early and eager to help with the finishing touches. You could see he had talent in how smooth he was at making sure everything was running the way it was suppose to from checking on the bride, making sure my bow tie and boutonnière were on correctly.  
Josh curated such a beautiful ceremony that people are still talking about. He made us laugh and he made us cry. He was thoughtful, knowledgeable and he took the time to learn about a few Mexican traditions that we requested as well. The wedding was that much more beautiful with him being the officiant.   
Thanks again Josh for being there for our big day!

Great experience 

We had a wonderful experience with Josh. From the start, he was warm, genuine, and intentional. He was easy to work with and provided many templates for us to choose from for different portions of the ceremony, and allowed for customization as well. He also took time to really get to know our story and used it to write a heartfelt ceremony that felt personal and authentic. On the wedding day, he brought a kind and calming presence, and he delivered a beautiful reading and prayer. We are truly grateful for his kindness, care, and sincerity.

Our Perfect Ceremony

We are beyond grateful to have chosen Rev. Josh as our officiant. It is difficult to articulate what an incredible job he did. He is responsive and professional, and made us feel supported and seen through the wedding planning process. By getting to know us as a couple and getting input from our friends and family, he crafted a ceremony that represented us perfectly. Our guests were raving about what an amazing job he did representing our love story and faith journeys in a ceremony that felt like it was written for us and our venue. We are still in awe of the ceremony Josh created for us, and we cannot recommend him enough.

Incredible Officiant

Josh did an absolutely phenomenal job at our ceremony. What drew us to Josh was his authenticity and style that he presented in his example videos, little did we know though that he's 100x better in person and honestly I don't think words can encapsulate how thrilled we are that we chose Josh as our officiant.   
  
He blew us away with the level of personalization he was able to weave into our ceremony through the stories and quips our friends submitted through a survey he had us send out.   
  
We'd highly recommend Josh to anyone, his demeanor, ability to speak to an audience, and ceremony crafting skill is second to none. We felt our ceremony was beyond perfect and wouldn't have changed a thing!

Amazing Wedding Ceremony

After discovering that our church’s pastor was not able to marry us (about 3 weeks before our wedding) I was in a panic. After some searching, I found Josh. He was quick, polite, and efficient. Our first meeting with Josh was via telephone. He put us at ease and made us excited again. Josh was very knowledgeable. He really allowed us to customize how we wanted our ceremony. Our second meeting was via video, which confirmed he was the right fit for us! The day of the wedding, he was prepared and on time. Our families really enjoyed him and the ceremony. His genuine personality and dedication is infectious and so worth getting to meet him. We HIGHLY recommend Josh for all of your wedding needs!

The Perfect Officiant 

Josh was the perfect officiant for our wedding. He made the ceremony personal, funny, and serious where it counted; it was exactly what we wanted, and we received so many compliments from family and friends. Josh is also an amazing person. We appreciated his guidance during the phone calls we had leading up to our wedding day. If you're looking for an officiant for your wedding, we would not hesitate to recommend Josh.

May wedding

I would highly recommend Josh! We are beyond happy with his services. He officiated our wedding ceremony last month in May. It was absolutely perfect! We wanted a non traditional civil ceremony. Josh made it so special with his beautiful words and friendly personality. It was everything we wanted and more thanks to Josh! He will set up a call with you and go over every detail which really made us feel comfortable and put us at ease. He also took care of mailing in the license which is very helpful and considerate so it’s one less thing to deal with before your honeymoon. Thank you again Josh for making our day so perfect!

Five Stars for Rev. Josh Rader Lee

Rev. Josh Rader Lee was amazing. He was very professional and flexible during last-minute wedding changes. He was available for us for wedding planning and couple therapy/pre-martial counseling. Highly recommended.

Wonderful ! 

We're 2 french girls and we came in NYC for our 10 years anniversary's wedding. We wanted a secular ceremony, and renoval vows.   
Josh was so helpful and he took pictures for us, he read and talk about our love like no one else !   
I recommand Josh very much. Everybody should trust him and realise the weddings with him and his expérience.  
Thank you so much Josh !

The Best Pastor! 

Josh is a great pastor and officiant! Despite our different religious backgrounds, he offered several templates from Christian to contemporary for the opening speech and curated it to be special for us. It meant a lot to me and my now husband that Josh took the time to learn who we are and incorporate that in our ceremony, it made our day feel even more special. Josh is responsive and answered our emails in a swift fashion as well as calling us to check in if we missed any emails. I highly recommend Josh if your looking for a professional and kind pastor/officiant!
