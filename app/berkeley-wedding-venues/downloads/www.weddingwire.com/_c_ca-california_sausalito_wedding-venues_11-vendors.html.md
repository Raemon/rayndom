We hosted our wedding at Sula at Cavallo Point. If you want a beautiful wedding with delicious food at a great price - book Sula. Helen Byrne was amazing to work with. We had 70 guests, which is the max the room can hold but the space is beautiful and requires 0 additions to make it a beautiful space.

Jeff and his team are amazing. I could not be more thrilled with how they handled my wedding. Everything went off without a hitch! Jeff is exceptionally accommodating, understanding and patient. The location site is breathtaking. Floor to ceiling glass windows looking out onto gorgeous blue water, sailboats, and hills in the distance. From the balcony, you have a beautiful view of the San Francisco city skyline. The food is delicious. My guests still comment about the food and hors d'oeuvre selection. The service was impeccable. There was never an empty wine glass in sight :) Overall, two thumbs up. Best place ever.

Our wedding at the Headlands Center for the Arts was beyond the gorgeous, spiritual, artistic, warm, and loving day I had envisioned for months during the planning. Once we visited, we just KNEW this was our location. During our tour, we stood in the ceremony spot in the East Wing and asked each other, "is this it?" And yes, is certainly was. A few months later, that spot is where we happily said "I do!" Driving into the Headlands is like entering a magical realm of nature, silence, and openness. The building has such relaxed, artistic vibe. When designing our wedding's look and feel, we were committed to working with its already super cool appeal. The distressed golden walls of the Rodeo Room have such character, making it the perfect backdrop for our Photo Booth selfie station... and they even inspired the texture of our wedding cake! Beyond the fact that we loved the venue, it is especially heartwarming to know that our rental fee is going toward sustaining this artistic organization and its artists, helping it to thrive. The wedding budget is always tricky and a bit painful, but it feels really good to know that chunk of money is going toward a worthy local cause. Going forward, we are so thankful this magical gem is available to our enjoyment, as we look forward to becoming members and experiencing the works from their artists in residence. For anyone thinking that this may be the venue for you, just like they say when you meet the right one, when you know, you know!
