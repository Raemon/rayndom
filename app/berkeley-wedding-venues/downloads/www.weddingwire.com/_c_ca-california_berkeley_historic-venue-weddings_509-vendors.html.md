(Review for catering/events/venue service) I don’t have enough great words for Nicole and her team at Berkeley City Club. I planned my wedding entirely “remotely” from out of state and Nicole was always ready to answer my millions of questions and make sure everything was being planned to perfection. I had actually never seen the hotel in person, and I must say the architecture, foliage, vibes, etc are better and MORE stunning in person than in photos. Truly a breathtaking venue that transports you with its historic arches, details, etc. Wedding food is often lackluster in my experience, but I was thoroughly impressed by all of the plated dinner dishes we were served. My salmon was perfectly cooked and guests complimented their meals as well. They were also able to accommodate all gluten free food as I have celiac disease, which was the cherry on top. Additionally, a special shout out to the staff who worked the event day-of. Everyone was kind with bright smiles, and treated me and everything/everyone else with care.

We booked this venue for our reception a year in advance. Because it is on campus, we had to find a date that did not conflict with the campus event schedule. Their coordinator changed a couple times before the wedding, but this did not hinder our communication. Our reception turned out perfect, and we could not have asked for a better venue. Unfortunately, our cake topper was misplaced. I loved how they gave us a closet to store our gifts overnight, so we didn't have to worry about hauling them to our car right away. I would definitely have another party here!
