Wedding at the Toledo Zoo

We couldn’t be happier with our decision to have our wedding at the Toledo Zoo! Not only is the venue beautiful and unique, but it also provided incredible value for the money. The team worked with us to make sure everything fit within our budget without ever compromising on quality.  
  
From start to finish, the staff was professional, organized, and so easy to work with. Their positive attitudes and clear communication made the entire planning process stress-free, and on the wedding day everything flowed seamlessly. It was such a relief knowing we were in good hands.  
  
If you’re looking for a wedding venue that combines affordability, professionalism, and an unforgettable atmosphere, the Toledo Zoo is a fantastic choice!

Fun and Unique Venue in Toledo

The Toledo Zoo was an awesome venue. Unique, different and fun. The Zoo's the staff and bartenders who worked the night of our wedding were so helpful and friendly.   
  
I really loved how much is included in the wedding packages offered by the Zoo (from bar service - to catering - to linens) which made it easy and breezy to plan the wedding!   
  
Gina, Faith and the events crew were all so great to work with. They were very organized and everything went wonderfully.   
  
This November we had our ceremony and reception in the Malawi Event Center which was so gorgeous! The reception area has a 70ft long aquarium in the room, which added so much charm. Between the ceremony and dinner we opted to have the carousel open for our cocktail hour, which made for great photos and lots of fun.   
  
Overall we received so many compliments how fun our wedding was, and we couldn't dare to disagree!

Zoo wedding 

The ceremony was beautiful, we had a reception in the aquarium and it was great. It was a little tight with 10 tables, but it was still nice and fun. The food was really good.

Amazing day at the Toledo Zoo

We had our ceremony in the formal garden and our reception in the aquarium. The staff at the Toledo Zoo was amazing. They were professional, organized and friendly. We had so many compliments on the food and the bar staff were great. They thought of every detail and made our day perfect. The aquarium was such a unique venue and I highly recommend the staff at the zoo.

Summer Zoo Wedding

I am amazed at the way our wedding came together in the end. My husband I chose to have a wedding at the Toledo Zoo Aquarium because it was such a special place for us. I worked with Gina Lambert to create my vision and I am so pleased about everything related to our special day. The zoo staff had everything under control and was prepared down to the smallest detail. On the day of the wedding, our day-of coordinator, Kasey, was phenomenal at helping with set-up and tear-down. I couldn't imagine having gotten married anywhere else. Thank you to Gina, Kasey, and the rest of the zoo staff for an absolutely magical day!

What more can I say than...WOW!!!

We held my daughter's wedding reception at the Malawi Center this past weekend. Everything was amazing- the ambiance, the food, the staff! I don't have enough exclamation points to interject how wonderful everything was! All the guests raved over the food and the setting. The staff (thank you so much Julia, Rayann, and everyone who worked that night!) was phenomenal, professional, and so helpful!! I just wish I had another daughter to marry off so we could do it again!!! Thank you so much to everyone at the Malawi Center for making our day perfect!!!

Amazing!!! 

The zoo gave us the best possible wedding we could’ve EVER imagined!! They were kind and helpful and kept everything running smoothly from the time we booked, all the way to the wedding day! Rayann is so sweet and took all of my phone calls and questions and never made me feel like I was bothering her. Julia went above and beyond expectations and is a wizard when it comes to setting up decor! If you’re considering the zoo, do yourself a favor and BOOK IT
