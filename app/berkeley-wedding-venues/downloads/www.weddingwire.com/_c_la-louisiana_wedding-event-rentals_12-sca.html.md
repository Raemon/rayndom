We used Distressed Rentals for a wedding at Marigny Opera House, and they were fantastic! The furniture was really well taken care of and beautiful.

Booked our flowers here and Kim Veillon was very knowledgeable, accommodating, and helpful with all our decisions. He even came up with ways to save money.

I was grateful to find this company for my event. The contact person always responded to my emails in a very timely manner and she was very pleasant to do business with. I had to make a few changes from the original order placed. That was handled without any issues. The tables and chairs were delivered as I had requested. I enjoyed meeting the owners when they delivered and set up. Whenever you can find a capable and reliable small business like this one, I highly recommended using them. Glad I found them and certainly would use them again.

They were quick with the estimate and contract. They were quick setting up and were familiar with the venue. They were able to adjust the contract as needed because of covid. Very easy to work with and a preferred vendor.

I used event rental for chairs at my outdoor wedding. Their chair pricing is very competitive and they were so easy to work with. Yvette would respond to my emails quickly and everything was booked online. The chair set up looked perfect and the take down portion was seamless. I highly recommend event rental for your chairs.
