We couldn’t have asked for a more magical experience than the one we had at the Flamingo Las Vegas Wedding Garden Chapel. The setting was serene and romantic, lush greenery, charming architecture, and a peaceful ambiance that made our daughter’s wedding feel like a fairytale. What truly made the day unforgettable was our incredible wedding coordinator, Brianna. Brianna was the heart and soul of the event, warm, professional, and remarkably attentive. Her calm demeanor and genuine care transformed what could have been a stressful day into a joyful celebration. Thanks to Brianna’s thoughtful coordination and the stunning venue, our daughter’s wedding was not just an event, it was a cherished memory we’ll hold onto forever. If you’re considering a Las Vegas wedding, the Flamingo Garden Chapel is a gem.

We booked the large chapel and it was more stunning in person than we could have imagined. We have received our video and photos which have far exceed our expectations. Everyone thought we knew the minister, he was great and tailored our ceremony after meeting us. It was a beautiful event and our guest are still raving about how meaningful and stunning our wedding was.

We chose Serket for our October 2025 wedding. We had an outdoor ceremony and reception for 100 people. We were very impressed with the value for the price. They also had the sweetest staff the day of (servers, bartenders, etc.). The food was even better than our tasting. They were super flexible and accommodating to all of our needs. Overall, we would definitely recommend them.

Complete pros, including Elvis! Ok, my spouse and I have been together for over 20 years and just wanted a basic tie-the-knot ceremony- figured a trip to Vegas would suffice. Via the internet, we ordered the basic, cheap package. Almost immediately I received email and text solicitations from one of their ‘planners’…what kind of flowers, how about photography, catering, how many guests, etc. It kinda felt like a Cham-wow kinda follow-up (to be fair- this is their business, they would be negligent if they didn’t follow up…). As my spouse and I are both over 60 years old, we were not like 21 year olds…we really saw no need for a big wedding and attendance by a bunch of acquaintances that one of us may not really like (does that happen re in-laws?!) Anyhow we selected an Elvis impersonator minister to officiate (great guy- ask for Joey Franklin), and added the basic photography option - I did all this 2 days before the ceremony, planner Sarah was effective and we were pleased to note when meeting her face-to-face that she was charming, gracious, and personable. Conclusion- a video taped Elvis officiated ceremony that could be viewed on a Johnny Carson show (Jimmy Fallon?), very fun, pics and video set to music with their applicable backdrops, props, music- I’m certain that one could not duplicate the quality provided even if one spent 5x and had a personal photographer…. Our $299 basic package turned into about $1700 . You’ll have email ready, entertaining super high quality media for your friends and family…(note-they have numerous video cams through the venue, so your video will have compelling changing viewpoint perspectives-like seeing yourselves on a professionally directed and produced tv show) I could easily imagine spending 10-15k with other ‘typical’ wedding event planners and getting a product not even on the same planet, quality-wise. Have a great wedding with all these pros, you won’t regret it! Thank you, thank you, thank you from Daniel and Kristine.

Our wedding day was an absolute dream—truly everything we had hoped for and more—and it was all thanks to the incredible team at the JW Marriott, especially Lauren, Audra, and Jena. From the moment we arrived for our initial site tour, we knew we were in the right place. Lauren greeted us with warmth, enthusiasm, and professionalism that immediately put us at ease. She was thorough in answering all of our questions, genuinely invested in our vision, and made us feel like our wedding truly mattered. Her energy and care played a huge role in our decision to choose JW Marriott as our venue. Once we began planning, we were paired with Audra—and I cannot emphasize enough what a gift she was throughout the process. Working with her was nothing short of a joy. She’s the perfect blend of organized, professional, responsive, and fun. Audra has an incredible ability to take the pressure off, allowing us to actually enjoy planning, which is no small feat! She quickly became a trusted sounding board, offering thoughtful suggestions and solutions drawn from her wealth of experience. When the big day arrived, I felt completely at ease knowing Audra was behind the scenes, handling every detail flawlessly so I could be fully present and soak in every moment. Speaking of details—this team’s attention to them is truly something special. They didn’t just meet our needs; they anticipated them. From personalized touches to seamless pivots when the unexpected popped up, they handled everything with grace and care. The ballroom itself was breathtaking—recently renovated and radiating luxury. Paired with the most delicious food (seriously, our guests are still talking about it!), the whole experience felt elevated and unforgettable. Meanwhile, Jena worked tirelessly behind the scenes to coordinate our room block. She was responsive, accommodating, and went above and beyond—even fielding last-minute requests just before our arrival. Thanks to her, our guests had a smooth and stress-free experience, and we received so many compliments about the beautiful rooms and surprisingly reasonable rates. Beyond the celebration itself, the JW Marriott property was absolutely stunning. From the elegant amenities to the thoughtful touches throughout the hotel, everything contributed to an unforgettable weekend—not just for us, but for all of our guests. If you’re looking for a venue that offers not only a beautiful setting, but a truly exceptional team that cares deeply about your day, look no further. Choosing the JW Marriott—and getting to work with people like Lauren, Audra, and Jena—was one of the best decisions we made. They didn’t just help us plan a wedding—they helped us create an experience we’ll treasure forever.

Working with Vegas Weddings was effortless and flawless! Our wedding day was perfect! The wedding planner, who is included in the wedding package, was awesome! Everyone was so helpful and accommodating. We were taken to the license bureau by their limo driver the day before to pick up our license, that was fun! Also we had two limos the day of the wedding so we didn't see each other before the ceremony. I highly recommend purchasing the photo and video package to receive all photos and video of the ceremony (and reception if you have one). The photographer captured every detail of our day and the photos are breathtaking! I received my ceremony video the day after our wedding and the photos a week after we got married. Our rose bouquets and boutonnière were gorgeous. The minister who we had never met made our ceremony personal and funny, it was great! The food was high quality and everyone commented on how great it tasted. The three tier wedding cake was beautifully decorated with real roses/designs and it was very tasty. Our reception coordinator was on top of it and everything flowed so smoothly during the reception. Our DJ was fun and interactive, did fun line dances with us, and played all the songs I had on my list, plus some other great songs. Our videographer was always present at the ceremony and reception capturing memories. We received the toasting flutes, guest book, pen, and cake cutting/serving set. Every guest at my wedding/reception has commented how perfect everything was! The only thing we would change is having a longer reception because it was so fun! Thank you so much to Vegas Weddings for making our day so incredibly special.

My wedding day (and the journey to) was everything that I dreamed of and more!! Our coordinator, Nikki, was the best. They handled everything while considering our budget and they were spectacular to work with. I specifically loved that they did not up charge for adding my separate decorations and really encouraged making it your own and facilitated doing so. My husband and I did not have to worry about a single thing. The food was great! The inclusive packages they offer are stellar. The value for the money - on point. 10/10 would recommend!!
