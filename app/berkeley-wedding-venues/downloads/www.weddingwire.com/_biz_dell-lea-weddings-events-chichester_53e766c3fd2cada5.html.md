Perfect Wedding

Not only is Dell-Lea an absolutely breathtakingly beautiful venue with outstanding, high-quality food, but the attention to detail given by Toutou Marsden and Laurie Russell is unparalleled. From the moment we looked at the venue to the final send-off, Toutou and Laurie didn't miss a beat. We didn't hire a separate wedding planner, but we didn't need to; we primarily used the vendors recommended by Dell-Lea (Boutique Leslie Bridal for the dress; Get Down Tonight Entertainment with DJ Jillian Mann for the music, Kiss the Bride with Alison Sica for photography, and Jacques Pastries for the cake) and everyone was so helpful and easy to work with! We added McElroy Films LLC as our videographer, and they were OUTSTANDING; Lyndsey Loring Design LLC as our florist, who created gorgeous AND AFFORDABLE bouquets, and Pixel Pod for a little bit of photo booth fun!   
Laurie and Toutou answered every question that we had along the way, met with us before the wedding to cover details, and expertly guided everyone through the ceremony both during the rehearsal and during the wedding. On the day of the wedding, we had nothing to do but enjoy the event, and I can't thank Toutou and Laurie at Dell-Lea more for giving our daughter the wedding of her dreams!

Amazing NH Venue

We got married at Dell-Lea in August and had the best experience. There is literally nothing that could have been done better. My husband and I got amazing service from tour, to details meeting, food tasting, rehearsal, day of the wedding all the way through picking up the decor the next day. It is so clear that TouTou and David have gone above and beyond to make their property welcoming and beautiful for everyone who visits.  
  
The food was amazing - in fact, a couple months later and we are still getting feedback from our friends and family that this was the best wedding food they ever had. Portions are great, appetizers are hearty and delicious - you really can't pick anything wrong with their entire selection.   
  
The servers were caring and made each of our guests feel taken care of. They were prompt and efficient, friendly and knowledgeable about the property's history which our guests enjoyed.   
  
The fact that I had TouTou as our day of coordinator was a God-send. Being a bride can be very stressful, but she thought of everything and then some. I felt relaxed knowing she was in charge and taking care of everything. She is a special person and I am so lucky we got to have her expertise.   
  
The beauty of this venue is unmatched. We toured several places and there really is nothing like this property. It is a slice of heaven on earth! The inside is rustically elegant which is exactly what we were going for. We didn't need to dress anything up - just focus on our personal touches - because the place is gorgeous inside and outside. David does a wonderful job maintaining the property along with TouTou's gardening of course.  
  
We had a Friday wedding and the fact that we could set up and rehearse the day before on a Thursday made everything so much easier for the day of. Highly recommend a Friday wedding for this reason!   
  
We want to thank the entire team for making our wedding planning and actual wedding day the best it could possibly have been.

5 star experience with the Dell Lea team!

We could not have asked for a better venue for our wedding on 9.21.24! We worked with Ashley and cant recommend her highly enough! She was amazing to work with and helped to make the wedding planning process less stressful. The venue itself is absolutely beautiful and TouTou and David were always amazing as well. It unfortunately rained on the day of our wedding but Ashley kept me updated on the plan all morning and made my dreams of having the ceremony outside a possibility. We ended up with the ceremony and photos of our dreams.   
  
We have a very laid back family but we did unfortunately have some issues with one of the bartenders being rude to a few of our guests and my maid of honor the day of the wedding (not Grant- he was amazing), but Ashley took care of it once she was aware of the situation.   
  
Overall I am so happy that we chose Dell-Lea for our wedding and had Ashley as our wedding planner, I would not have changed a thing! The food was amazing and we also had a great time at the food tasting. We had an amazing time dancing the night away and our guests had so much fun! I wish I could re-live the night over and over again!

The Perfectly Beautiful NH Venue

Absolutely speechless. Dell-Lea is chef’s kiss perfect. We had the most amazing fall weather and foliage and sunset. Completely blow away by how effortlessly beautiful the day was - we brought no outside/ceremony decorations because the backdrop is so stunning.  
  
Laurie - our day of coordinator - was the master of all masters. She handled everything and seemed to be in 10 places at once all night long. She always checked in with us to see if we needed more food or drinks. She seamlessly handled a vendor snafu - our three bus drivers did not order a meal when I asked before our final headcount was due, but requested a meal on arrival at the venue. Laurie provided them each a meal and I didn’t hear a peep about it until the night was over! She helped my family pack up our decorations at the end of the night and made sure we had everything we needed. She even donated my bridesmaids bouquets to a local nursing home!  
  
The food - cannot say enough about how delicious the food was. Multiple guests came up to us during and shortly after dinner service to rave about their meals - the stuffed chicken, espresso encrusted filet, and cashew cheese ravioli. All so good, and my husband and I had all three at our table! The appetizers - incredible! The family recipe crab rangoons are worth the hype! The bartenders were incredible all night and nailed our signature cocktails.  
  
Working with Dell-Lea was seamless. I sent only a handful of emails before our details meeting because everything is so clear. Dell-Lea offers rental decorations, so we chose to rent table numbers, eucalyptus strands, centerpiece accents, and popular signage, saving us so much money. We cannot say enough good things about Dell-Lea - our day was so beautiful and perfect. We hope to be a guest at Dell-Lea someday!

A cut above the rest 

We recently celebrated our wedding at Dell-Lea, and it was nothing short of spectacular. The venue, a picturesque old barn set against a stunning backdrop, provided the perfect setting for our special day. Dell-Lea effortlessly blends rustic charm with modern amenities, creating an ambiance that is both inviting and elegant.  
Our day-of coordinator, Laurie, was phenomenal. Her attention to detail, coordination skills, and warm demeanor ensured everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment without worry. The owners, David and TouTou, were also incredible throughout the entire process. Their dedication to providing exceptional service and value is evident in every aspect of their operations.  
The culinary experience was a highlight for us and our guests, who raved about the quality and presentation of the food. Despite pushing the venue to its capacity with 180 guests, the space felt ample and accommodating.  
Additional features such as the sunflower field and the charming wagon added a unique touch to our wedding, creating perfect photo opportunities. The beautifully updated farmhouse offered a comfortable and stylish space for preparations and relaxation.  
Choosing Dell-Lea was the best decision we made, and we are immensely grateful to the entire team for making our wedding day truly unforgettable. If you're looking for a venue that offers beauty, value, and top-notch service, Dell-Lea is the place.

We love Dell-Lea!

Dell-Lea was the first venue we visited. After visiting a few other venues we realized how lucky we were to have found Dell-Lea and quickly booked it! Toutou is perfect at what she does - meeting with her felt like a family member helping us prepare for our big day. She and the staff clearly love what they do, and it shows. They offered us helpful vendor recommendations in the area, and Toutou’s extensive experience helped the entire day run smoothly. They include many small touches throughout the day that keep the schedule running smoothly. Dell-Lea’s food and drink menu is extraordinary and they were very accommodating of a number of food allergies and preferences. We love how they work with local bakeries and other vendors for specific desserts, including locally made vegan ice cream. We received so many compliments on the food and drinks - some of the highlights were the cashew cheese ravioli and the late night ballpark pretzels. It’s amazing that they have decorations to rent - this saved us a lot of time and money! The location is gorgeous and there are so many great picture options throughout the property.

A stressless day

We had our wedding at Dell-Lea in June. Toutou (the owner) was amazing to work with. She had everything organized to the smallest detail to make our lives easier. All of our questions leading to the date were answered promptly. The food, cooked in-house was phenomenal. Our outside vendors were well coordinated with the venue. The biggest thing we talk about from that night was just how easy our day was made because of the professionalism that Dell-Lea offered us.

Perfect Choice

Dell-Lea proved to be a gorgeous venue for our son's summer wedding. We appreciated the kindness of the owners (and their children!) and their flexibility with our decoration vision. Laurie was patient and professional and a pleasure to interact with. The food was delicious and fresh, and numerous guests complimented us on the variety of vegetables and the meat and fish preparation. The space was enchanting and made for a memorable day. Thank you!

Beautiful Venue

My husband and I got married this past June at Dell-Lea. Tou-Tou, Laurie and the staff at Dell-Lea were incredibly helpful and responsive throughout our wedding planning process. Everything turned out so amazingly beautiful! We were grateful for their in-house catering (which was top notch food) and for their support finding other vendors. Would definitely recommend!

The Bergeron Wedding - Dell-Lea Review 5/5

I can not praise Dell-Lea for everything that went into our wedding day! From our first wedding venue meeting, Toutou was very inviting and made us feel welcomed in our one-on-one. Between the beautiful backdrop view of the ceremony to the layout and set-up of the reception area, we left that meeting infatuated with the venue and the comfort of knowing where our wedding would be. The whole process went so smooth and Toutou guided us through every step of the way.  
  
Unfortunately, like many newlyweds this summer, we had rain on our wedding day. The staff (Toutou and Abigail) made the transition from an outdoor ceremony to an indoor ceremony so smooth. They took care of everything and alleviated the stress and pressure of this transition of coordinating and moving decorations.  
  
Everything turned out perfect! The timeline and coordination of the wedding events were on point, the food was immaculate, the service was unbelievable.  
  
All in all, I can't recommend Dell-Lea Weddings & Events highly enough. Abigail and Toutou made our wedding feel special and booking their venue was one of the easiest and best decisions we made.
