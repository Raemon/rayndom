So many choices!

We wanted to use someone local for our wedding invitations, and am so happy we found Happy Frog! They have a wide variety of options to choose from, meeting with them in person and getting to see our choices hands-on was a huge factor in helping us decide what we wanted. We had the invitation with a pocket on the back that held the RSVP card and envelope, a details card and an afterparty details card. We loved the end result and went back to have them also print the table numbers. Their design team is very professional and walked us through everything, nothing was printed until things were double- and triple-checked. I highly recommend them for printing for any occasion.

Amazing experience

Rose-Marie and the rest of the team at Happy Frog helped me accomplish wedding invitations that I didn't think were even possible. We had a unique request that we wanted our invitations to look like Colonial American scrolls (think the Declaration of Independence). Not only did they help us with the executing scrolls with wax seals (how authentic!) they even helped with the phrasing to make it have that old english feel. Our wedding guests were so impressed with how it all came out, my mother-in-law even had our invitations professionally framed so they can be enjoyed forever. Thank you so much Happy Frog, I could not have been happier working with you.

Perfect Invitations and Extras

We ordered our invitations and some wedding extras here - and every item was perfect. First, they let you piece together the invitation you are imagining in your head. Shannon offered her expertise with sizing and wording options. We received so many compliments on our invitations. We also received wedding extras - customized wedding guest menus and a few signs. All coordinating with our invitation imagery and fonts. They made it easy and one less stressor to make our day complete.

Invitations, menus, favor tags 

Loved everything about Happy Frog! We got our wedding invitations, menus, tags for wedding favors, and cards for our hotel welcome bags through Happy Frog and everything was beautiful. They were extremely easy to work with, quick to respond, and extremely creative. We told them what we liked/didn’t like and they created a thoughtful, high quality and unique product. We received so many compliments on our stationary. It was much easier and the quality was unmatched compared to using an online site. Would highly recommend them and Definitely will use them in the future!

Amazing products!!!

Happy Frog is Amazing!! They were included in our Wedding Package and I am so glad they were! Very easy to work with, and the invitations came out more beautiful than I could have ever imagined. Multiple guests actually wrote on their RSVP cards how much they loved the invitations! We were so impressed that after we sent out the invitations, we went back a few times and had them print us table numbers. place cards, Thank you stickers for our favors and a poster for our guests to sign instead of a guest book. Very professional, easy to work with, high quality and very reasonable prices. Happy Frog is a hidden gem for sure!!

Wonderful Company with Wonderful Service

Happy Frog was so wonderful from the beginning. I used them for my save the dates as well as my wedding invitations and I was incredibly impressed with not only the customer service and working with them on designing both but also the quality of the product. I wanted a very specific invitation and could not find it anywhere, I finally found exactly what I wanted at Happy Frog and was really impressed with their huge selection of options and colors. They walked me through every step and gave professional advice on how it would look or where they would place pictures. I also used the option to have my envelopes addressed and their system was well explained and broken down into steps which I found very easy to follow. Every staff member I worked with so friendly as well as knowledgeable and I really enjoyed my experience there!

Beautiful Invitations

We had our save the dates and invitations done here and they were perfect. I didn’t realize how much goes into wedding stationary and was completely overwhelmed in the beginning. The Happy Frog made it painless for us and everything was beautiful! Our guests are still in awe of how elegant our invitations were with the pocket style we chose! You won’t find a better place!

Fantastic for Wedding Invitations

Rose-Marie was such a pleasure to work with and made the process of setting up invitations so easy to do. We were so happy with the final outcome and had no issues with any of the invitations. Very quick to respond on feedback to make adjustments. Also loved the variety of products Happy Frog offered. Thank you
