## What are Wedding Favors and Gifts?

Wedding favors are a great way to say “thank you" to wedding guests for joining you on your Big Day. Many couples also choose to recognize bridesmaids, groomsmen and both sets of parents with more substantial gifts. Because finding the perfect wedding favors and gifts can sometimes be a challenge, we recommend exploring options about three months before your wedding – especially if you plan on personalizing anything.

While on the one hand, you want to show your guests and wedding party how much it means that they were a part of your wedding – on the other hand, you don't want to break the bank on less-than-memorable mementos. Don't worry! We're here to help you find wedding favors and gifts that suit your style and budget. For some initial inspiration, check out our wealth of wedding favor ideas.

## Types of Wedding Favors

Wedding favors come in all shapes, sizes and prices. There are plenty of possibilities to choose from. One popular option is to go with something edible. Some favorites are chocolate, some type of food bar with personalized containers or bags that guests can fill up, homemade honey or jam, and custom-labeled bottles of beer or wine. Alternatively, if you and your fiancé(e) are looking to give back to the community on your special day, go with charitable wedding favors. This involves making a donation to one or more of your favorite charities in your guest’s name. Personalized trinkets are another great way to say thank you without blowing the entire [wedding budget](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/wedding-budget.html "Wedding Budget Planner"). These can be anything from a bottle opener to beverage koozies to mini mason jars.

Personalized send-off wedding favors are a great twist on sending off the newlyweds in style. Common options include bubbles, confetti poppers, and sparklers. You can attach a personalized tag or have your names printed right on the front. It's also quite common to give something a little extra to out-of-town guests, such as [welcome bags or baskets](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-awesome-things-to-include-in-your-wedding-welcome-bag "10 Wedding Welcome Bag Items That Make for Awesome Gifts") filled with drinks and snacks. You can even make arrangements to have these waiting upon arrival at their hotel. Or, if you’re hosting a destination wedding, a locally-sourced wedding favor or gift is the perfect way to go for all of your guests.

## Wedding Gifts vs. Wedding Favors: Who Gets What?

Wedding gifts tend to be reserved for close family members of the couple, such as their parents. They are also appropriate for members of the wedding party. These gifts are generally more expensive and can be more personal than the wedding favors given out to all of your wedding guests.

Some great gift ideas for bridesmaids include: monogrammed hats, bags or clutches, engraved jewelry, or matching robes to wear when getting ready for the Big Day. Fun groomsmen gifts to consider are engraved watches, cufflinks, personalized glassware, cigars or a bottle of their favorite liquor.

Be sure to add the task of shopping for wedding favors and gifts onto your [WeddingWire Free Wedding Checklist](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-checklists.html "Wedding Checklists"), so that this important element isn’t overlooked in the busy months ahead.
