Amazing photographer/videographer/Photo Booth!

I don’t even know how to put into words how incredible this team is. They weren’t just vendors—they were storytellers, artists, and part of our celebration. From the first look to the last dance, they captured everything with such creativity and heart.  
  
Our photos are breathtaking, the video feels like a movie trailer of our love story, and the photo booth gave us hilarious, sweet memories from all of our guests. They thought of every detail, stayed organized, and made the whole process stress-free.  
  
Looking back, I can’t imagine our wedding without them. They gave us memories we’ll cherish for a lifetime, and I will never stop recommending them to other couples.

Best team for our wedding day!

We booked Elegant Events Media last year for our wedding in April 26, 2025. We just received our video and are absolutely awed and delighted by how great the videographer captured our day!   
Even though it's been only 3 months since we got married, we keep talking and reminiscing about this day. We booked our photographer, videographer, and DJ with Elegant Events Media and it made the day feel so cohesive and smooth. We definitely recommend them and highly encourage everyone to book Elegant Events!

Perfect For Any Wedding 

You must hire EEM! They did a great job! We hired them for our wedding in March to be the videographer, DJ, and Photo Booth. They were very responsive and on top of things. Super organized! I enjoyed working with them very much. Our video turned out amazing! I have watched it a million times! Highly recommend!

Videography & DJ Services in Northern Nevada

We used Elegant Events Media for our Northern Nevada wedding in May 2024, and we're so happy we did! They provided videography and DJ services (we already had a different photographer booked), which were a great value with combining multiple services. We received our videos - Instagram edit, Highlight Reel, and Raw footage edit - in about 12.5 weeks, and we couldn't be happier with this team. The production quality is beautiful, and the audio is very clear even though we had 40-50 mph winds during our outdoor ceremony. It's such a treat to have this video footage to look back on forever. Thank you Elegant Events Media!

Highly Recommend

Highly recommend Elegant Events. We had Brad as our videographer, Steve as our photographer, and Tre as our DJ. Everyone was so professional and the quality of work is stunning. Excellent communication and truly eased the stress of the day. You will not be disappointed!

Best Media Team!! 

Hands down best money we spent was hiring the Elegant Events team! We found them watching a YouTube video of our venue and loved the way they captured the couples wedding. Our first meeting went well and we really liked that EEM could provide not just photo and video services but also DJ and a fun photobooth experience! Brad was so great to work with and held my hand during many setbacks (we had to move our wedding 3x) and even came up with solutions for us that we didn't even know we needed. When our big day finally came - nothing went as planned due to covid except our ceremony - Brad and Maria captured the memories of the day just perfectly! Maria even had us do a cake cutting and first dance so we wouldn't miss out on those. I also want to mention our ceremony DJ was steller! I could hear all of our pre-ceremony music playing throughout the park, he had everything qued/mic'd up with a great wireless system that was perfect for our park wedding and was hands down the sweetest guy! If you want to work with great people - then choose Elegant Events Media, you won't regret a thing!

Best choice we made! 

Best decision we made for our wedding! We originally were planning to not have a videographer as it wasn’t quite in the budget.   
  
After consulting our family (4 weeks before our wedding!) I decided to pull the trigger. I interviewed 4 vendors, and Brad and the team seemed the most professional, flexible and attentive.   
  
The day of our wedding, Brad was punctual, professional and the most prepared vendor we worked with. He was conscious of our goals, timeframes and was very communicative.  
  
Ww got our videos ahead of schedule and WOW. I was blown away. The quality and editing was so impressive. He provided multiple sizzle reels, a highlight reel, and an edited full footage film of the entire wedding! The best decision we made. Thanks Elegant Events!

Amazing! So happy with them!

When my husband and I started looking for photographers and videographers for our wedding, we quickly discovered how expensive these 2 vendors can be. While doing further research on Yelp, we came across Elegant Events Media. We really liked the idea of one vendor providing everything we needed (photographer, videographer, and DJ/MC). When we decided to book our initial informational meeting with Brad, the owner, they were having a special that month that combined photography (engagement shoot & wedding day), videography, DJ/MC, photo booth, small lighting package, and media coordinator for one amazing price! We were sold!! And the price of this entire package was less than some quotes we got back from just photography and videography packages through other vendors.   
  
From the start, Brad’s communication was spot on. I was our wedding planner and I’m a very organized person, so I appreciated that he never got tired of all my emails/questions and always got back to me in a timely manner. Our dream team was set and ready to go... and then the pandemic hit and the postponements began. With all the postponements Brad had to deal with, he was always very accommodating to us. We almost lost them because not all of our team was available on the new date, but Brad worked wonders and found a new dream team. We were back on track and he brought my stress level way down! We also decided that having a photo booth wasn’t a good idea anymore due to the lack of being able to social distance our guests and we also didn’t need the small lighting package anymore, so he was gracious enough to refund that portion of the package price to us.   
  
Maria (engagement shoot photographer) - Unfortunately, Maria was booked at another wedding on the date of our new wedding day, but she did our engagement photo shoot. We loved her! We went to Folsom Lake in November and it was perfect! This was our very first professional photo shoot together and we were kind of nervous and worried about looking awkward. Maria made us feel so comfortable and at ease. She was also very personable. Her photos came out amazing; we loved them!   
  
Olga (wedding day photographer) - Olga is super sweet and has an eye for great shots. She directed us on how to pose and she captured all my must-have shots. The photos she took came out beautiful! I loved that she captured all of our wedding day details because that’s what I spent over a year dreaming about and being able to see what was in my head for so long in a photo makes me so happy! They are memories that will last a lifetime. We relive our wedding day every time we look at our photos.   
  
Hai (videographer) - Hai was really sweet as well and has a great eye for a good shot. He also did drone videography, which was amazing to see our wedding venue from the sky! I cried when we saw our wedding video! It came out so good and we love it so much. We’re able to relive our special day every time we watch it. It includes all the most important parts and people and flows so nicely. He made us feel so comfortable as well.   
  
Justin (DJ/MC) - From our first meeting with Justin, we felt very comfortable and we knew he’d be the best for our needs. He really made our day flow with amazing music and transitions. He has an electric personality and had everyone on the dance floor. We had talked beforehand about specific songs at specific parts of our wedding and he was spot on with all of them. He really listened to the vibe we wanted. His equipment is very high tech as well and great quality. It really helped make the audio in our video just perfect!  
  
Brittany (media coordinator) - Brittany was there to help keep communication between our photographer, videographer, DJ/MC, and day-of wedding coordinator open and flowing so everyone kept on schedule. Her assistance was definitely appreciated to help keep everyone on the same page. She was very kind as well.   
  
Anyway, I highly recommend Elegant Events Media for all your media needs in one vendor and price! It’s well worth it and a lot less stress! Brilliant concept!

Perfect and flexible

Elegant Events was extremely flexible in sorting out all the changes due to the Covid Restrictions. Changed the venue from Folsom to SoCal and worked with us with to make our day perfectly documented. Our photos and video couldn't be more perfect or more professional.
