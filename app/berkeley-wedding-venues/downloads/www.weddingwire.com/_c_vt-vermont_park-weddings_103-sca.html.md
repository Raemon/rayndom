After our elopement, we hosted a reception at VINS for guests to celebrate with us. They were able to visit the exhibits, explore the canopy walk, and have a warm indoor space to eat, drink, listen to music, and socialize. We did the bird on the glove which was a hit. Erica, the event coordinator, was wonderful before the event and the day of, helping us set up and even find last minute items like a wine opener and matches that we had forgotten. I was so impressed with the value for the reasonable rental fee and the assistance of the staff. Highly recommend this venue and it's wonderful to know the fees go to a great organization.

The Wild Center was the perfect reception venue for our Tupper Lake Wedding. Josh was extremely easy and flexible to work with and was very responsive to us and our vendors. We were able to utilize the tent for our cocktail hour and the great hall for the reception. It was a treat for our guests to experience the exhibits and Wild Walk. The Wild Center provided a great kitchen for our caterer, a room to store all of our decor, bartenders, tables, chairs, flatware, linens, glasses, etc. which made it very easy.

Ohana is a truly magical place for a wedding, and we are so happy this was the first decision we made when planning our wedding! We knew we wanted to have a summer camp vibe where everyone could stay on site, and our second biggest priority was amazing food - two requests that we were worried would not be possible together. We were wrong! Chef Steve at Ohana created a visionary menu for us - we wanted non-traditional pasta dishes to echo our time studying abroad in Italy, and he delivered. There was a gorgeous trio of pasta dishes that he suggested be served family style, and it was a huge hit with our guests. All of the food throughout the whole weekend was amazing, from the from-scratch toppings for our Friday night taco bar, to the freshly fried arancini appetizers, to the blueberry sauce to top the fluffy pancakes on Sunday morning. The opportunity to celebrate for the entire weekend with our guests staying on site was so special, and the grounds are the best of Vermont’s beauty. We enjoyed beautiful sunsets, crisp nights under the stars, and a beautiful wedding morning spent jumping in the waters of Lake Fairlee. Of course, they are a summer camp in rural Vermont, so remember that they won’t be able to get back to you as quickly as a traditional venue, but it ended up working out totally fine for us. Gretchen, the wedding coordinator, knows how to make the whole weekend run like a well-oiled machine. Our guests could not stop raving about everything the entire weekend, and are still talking about it all 3 weeks later!!! I can’t think of anything that could have went better during the weekend, and it was the most memorable part of our wedding!

Sky Acres has one of the best views I have ever seen in Vermont! The view from the ceremony location is all of the Green Mountain ridgeline from Killington through to Mount Ellen and Camel's Hump! Working with Cilla was a pleasure, she was so easy to communicate with and responsive. We wanted a mountain view but needed a place that was accessible for our elderly grandparents and this location gave us both. Additionally, the cost for this view cannot be beat, it was very affordable!

I had the best experience at Maple Lane Estate! The views were gorgeous and the perfect backdrop for our ceremony. We had about 200 guests join us so I was pretty nervous about transportation, but we had plenty of time to coordinate services (as recommended by the owners of the estate) and the parking lot had just enough space. One of my favorite parts of the experience was getting ready in the bridal suite. Before the ceremony started it was nice to relax and take my time with my bridal party – so stress free! I had also asked for a list of local vendors that we could sort through and the estate had an entire list ready which was a wonderful touch. From the beginning to the end I felt very taken care.
