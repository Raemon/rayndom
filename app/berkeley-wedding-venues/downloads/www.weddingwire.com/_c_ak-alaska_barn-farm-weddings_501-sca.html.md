The staff works hard to make the experience exactly what you want it to be. They made major improvements to the lodge and cabins right before our wedding. The only down side was the heaters did not work well in the cabins and our guests were cold (our wedding was in February) but since our wedding was over 2 years ago I am unsure if that has already been resolved. Besides that there was lots of parking and an amazingly spectacular view of Denali. The lodge was warm and well lit. The kitchen was the perfect size for our caterers and all of our guests raved about our wonderful venue. It was well worth every penny we paid.

Stephanie and Billy were great to work with from start to finish. Very easy going but also professional in every aspect. They made the entire process much more smooth and simple than I had imagined it would be. Their venue is absolutely stunning and offers literally everything you need! We didn't purchase any additional decorations, we just used what was already provided and everything turned out great. My wife and I loved it, our guests loved it, I would recommend AK Diamond J Ranch to anyone getting married in Alaska and looking for the ideal venue!

My now husband and I eloped in Alaska this past summer, August 2021, and wanted to incorporate some fun adventures for our special day. One of these adventures included a horseback ride in the mountains at Sunderland Ranch. Katie and her entire team were so helpful and accommodating from the minute I first contacted them about setting up an evening ride, later than their normal business hours, for optimal lighting and photography. The whole team was very friendly and knowledgeable about the horses and how to go about introducing them to my wedding dress so they didn't freak out. My husband also had never rode a horse before and was slightly apprehensive, but the team helped him to feel comfortable and we ended up having the best time and have photos that we will cherish for a lifetime. I highly recommend Sunderland Ranch for anyone looking for the perfect wedding venue or adventure, it was truly stunning and an overall, great experience.
