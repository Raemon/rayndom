The Rep was absolutely amazing and helped us through the process, purchasing was fast and easy, and it came exactly when it said it would. The online pictures when purchasing just doesn't do it justice, it sparkled more then I could have ever imagined and the fire in the ring is breathtaking.

This review is for the Newtown Square location, specifically with their associate Tara. I bought my wedding band there after shopping with Tara. Benari itself has such a great selection of bridal but Tara made the process so painless. I have been to jewelry stores where I have felt some dishonesty happening and pushiness and there is absolutely none of that with Tara. I will continue to go to Tara for any of my jewelry needs in the future and I recommend that you do the same!

Our custom made pieces are beyond our expectations. The Garcia family not only made us beautiful jewelry they also made us feel like part of the family. They are extremely patient and cordial. We can’t thank them enough for our beautiful rings

I’m April 2020 I bent my engagement ring. Being in the thick of lockdown, I had no idea what to do. Beeghly’s had me bring my ring in and fixed it within a day! I loved their customer service so much, we purchased mine and my husbands wedding bands here!

I’m the 3rd generation to use this jeweler and Julie 1000% attended to all of our needs for our wedding rings! She was attentive, patient and made sure we were on track with everything! Most of all Julie was professional and respectful to my fiancé and I as she shared excitement with us for our big day! As always I would never think twice about using another jeweler! Thank you Julie!!

My husband Randy and I have nothing but incredible things to say about Amy. She was attentive and suggested the best rings based not on her bottom line, but on what suited us best. Her prices were more than fair. Randy and I love the fact that her line is sustainable and "green" (recycled precious metals). After seeing how affordable (and ethical) her pieces are, I refuse to but anymore from large retail chains. Amy will be my go-to gal for bling!
