If wedding planning was a walk in the park for you, it probably means you’re no strangers to hosting a party or two. If yours is the go-to place for a dinner party, _This is Us_ watch night, or the Super Bowl, you might want to stock up on home items that match your host personality, including the perfect pizza stone for a DIY Italian night and salt and pepper cellars that will make your table stand out.

## These registry favorites from Macy’s are sure to gain as many compliments as that cheese spread you just placed in front of your guests.

### **Shake Things Up**

Every bar needs a cocktail shaker. How else are you going to serve up fresh martinis (shaken, not stirred) and cosmos? This cocktail shaker is a modern yet timeless classic with a functional and minimalist vibe.

**OXO Good Grips** cocktail shaker, [Macy's](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8278.162200.WEDDINGWIRE.COM/B22529003.246924661;dc_trk_aid=443370632;dc_trk_cid=116238853;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=)

### **Throw a Pizza Party**

Nothing says party like a big pizza pie—whether it’s for a large crowd or just you and your beau. Take pizza night over the top with a pizza stone. The stone traps and disperses heat for a perfectly crisp crust. And it’s not just a one-trick pony, a pizza stone can be used to bake cookies, whip up quesadillas, or help regulate the temperature of your oven.

### **Keep Things Chill**

Save room—and trips to—in the fridge by registering for a wine chiller, a tool _every_ host and hostess should have on hand for a dinner party. The sleek metal chiller keeps wine cool, and is pretty enough to leave out on the bar or your table full-time.

**Nambe** 7-inch wine chiller, [Macy’s](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8278.162200.WEDDINGWIRE.COM/B22529003.247106163;dc_trk_aid=443370902;dc_trk_cid=116239839;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=)

### **Coffee, Anyone?**

If serving your guests a cup of coffee or espresso is your ideal way to cap off a great evening, this elegant set is definitely worth adding to your registry. Your guests will be wowed by these modern marble pieces at your next fête. 

**Thirstystone** espresso collection, [Macy's](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8278.162200.WEDDINGWIRE.COM/B22529003.247106169;dc_trk_aid=443370905;dc_trk_cid=116238859;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=)

### **Put a Label on It**

These cheeky markers are the perfect registry item for any cheese-loving couple. Write your own labels to ensure your guests know exactly which cheese they're enjoying. 

**Martha Stewart Collection** cheese markers, [Macy’s](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8278.162200.WEDDINGWIRE.COM/B22529003.246925981;dc_trk_aid=443297268;dc_trk_cid=116277386;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=)

### **Top Your Table**

If you're all about providing your dinner guests with options, this serving set will be the heroes of your next party. Whether you're serving up a variety of dips, snacks, or other treats, this super-functional set is ideal. 

**Villeroy & Boch **Artesano serveware collection, [Macy’s](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8278.162200.WEDDINGWIRE.COM/B22529003.246769808;dc_trk_aid=443297271;dc_trk_cid=116237308;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=)

### **Say Cheers**

Raise a toast to your guests with a set of tumblers. We love the pretty (and unique) blue ombre hue of these rocks glasses. 

**Hotel Collection** blue tumblers, [Macy’s](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8278.162200.WEDDINGWIRE.COM/B22529003.246771545;dc_trk_aid=443430493;dc_trk_cid=116277389;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=)

### **The Ultimate Chip and Dip**

Whether you’re serving up chips and salsa, pimento cheese and cucumbers, or hummus and pita, this chip-and-dip set makes the perfect serving vessel. With a high lip, it’s easy to carry to the table without spilling—and large enough that you won’t need to refill anytime soon, no matter how hungry your guests are.

**kate spade new york** Charlotte Street grey chip and dip, [Macy’s](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8278.162200.WEDDINGWIRE.COM/B22529003.246924664;dc_trk_aid=443297280;dc_trk_cid=116238868;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=)

### **Top Tier**

This on-trend server will easily impress your guests, and not just for its two-toned marble and gold coloring. This unique serving piece offers you the chance to show off small bites or desserts, and the marble shelves keep your masterpieces cool.

**Hotel Collection** two-tier marble server, [Macy’s](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8278.162200.WEDDINGWIRE.COM/B22529003.247105983;dc_trk_aid=443370680;dc_trk_cid=116238871;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=)

### **Piece of Cake**

If you’re the couple who was more-than-excited for the cake tasting part of planning, this is the ultimate registry item for you. A cake stand is the perfect way to make sure there is always dessert in your kitchen—and handsomely shown off, too.

**Cellar** cake dome and stand, [Macy’s](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8278.162200.WEDDINGWIRE.COM/B22529003.246925246;dc_trk_aid=443369432;dc_trk_cid=116277383;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=)
