Our wedding day was seamless, beautiful, and truly unforgettable — all thanks to Tracy’s dedication and talent. We’re so grateful for everything she did to bring our vision to life.

Si pudiéramos dar 10 estrellas, ¡las daríamos! Nosotros planeamos nuestra boda desde el extranjero, por lo cual elegir a wedding planners adecuados fue la decisión más importante que tomamos en todo el proceso. Desde la primera vez que nos reunimos con Dany y Lili, sentimos que estábamos en buenas manos. Su profesionalismo, atención a cada detalle y comunicación es incomparable. Dany y Lili dedicaron un año y medio a asegurarse que nuestra boda fuera mejor de la de nuestros sueños. Aunque estábamos tan lejos, ellas nos mantuvieron al tanto de cada detalle, por medio de mensajes y por reuniones virtuales. La comunicación siempre fue impecable. Una de las cosas que más apreciamos de Dany y Lili es su compromiso a tener cuantas sean las reuniones necesarias para que tuviésemos la boda de nuestros sueños. Cada visita a México, antes de la boda, Dany y Lili nos prepararon un itinerario de la semana, para que nosotros pudiéramos aprovechar cada hora de nuestra visita para las pruebas de comida, maquillaje, visitar lugares para la boda, sesión de fotos, etc. Fue un tremendo alivio el no tener que mantener contacto con cada proveedor, ya que sabíamos que Dany y Lili se iban a encargar de todo. El día de nuestra boda fue perfecto. Si hubo algo que dio problema, no nos dimos cuenta porque Dany y Lili ya se habían encargado del asunto. Nuestra familia y amigos nos hicieron varios comentarios de lo duro que Dany y Lili y su equipo trabajaron ese día. A una invitada incluso se le descosió su vestido, y Lili la llevó al baño a coser el vestido para que ella pudiera seguir disfrutando de la noche. Honestamente, no nos podemos imaginar nuestra boda sin Dany y Lili. Tenemos mucho agradecimiento a todo el trabajo que ellas hicieron para hacer nuestro día tan especial. Lo mejor es que al fin de este proceso, nos casamos, pero también hicimos dos amigas del alma - ¡eso no se encuentra en todas partes! Dany y Lili son muy especiales, tanto que se convirtieron en como familia para nosotros. A cualquier persona de CDMX o del extranjero, no piensen dos veces, como Dany y Lili no hay otras!! xoxo, Ale & Chris

We had an incredible experience with Destination Weddings Tulum. Planning a destination wedding in Tulum while living in Colorado could have been stressful, but Juliette, Paulina, and everyone else on our team made everything feel easy and worry free. They were highly organized, responsive, and truly understood our vision. We always felt confident and supported throughout the planning process. We trusted our team so much, our wedding day was the first time seeing the venue and everything in person - planning thousands of miles away didn’t leave us with many opportunities to visit often 😅. Thank you Helen for helping us organize transportation from the airports and to the venue! Everything was perfectly coordinated, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our wedding day. We couldn’t recommend them more highly to anyone planning a destination wedding in Tulum.

: Our wedding was May 23, 2025 at ACRE. I’ve been stalling writing this review because I want to keep this amazing team all to myself- but I can’t and people deserve the same memorable experience we had so here it is! From the very first consultation, Fatima made us feel at ease. She was transparent, listened carefully to our vision and immediately came up with thoughtful, creative ideas to bring it all to life- all with being considerate of our budget (which when planning a wedding is obviously a main focus, right?). Planning a wedding is a lot- planning a destination wedding adds a little extra layer of challenges but we felt none of that with this team. We are based in southern California, our hotel block was at Hilton Los Cabos and our wedding venue was the outstanding ACRE. From day one Fatima was incredibly organized and on it. The planning platform used (Aisle Planner) is a Type-A person's dream come true (like myself); it allows you to keep track of timelines, budget/payments, visions boards, guests/seating, etc. The checklists and reminders were life-savers and Fatima always seemed to be three steps ahead. It truly is a tool that assists in making the entire planning process smooth. What truly stood out was how much heart Fatima puts into her work and passion for her clients. She also has excellent relationships with vendors she worked with for our wedding- which I think says a lot about her reputation and work ethic. She was always accessible, calm and patient. My husband and I had a “non-tradiational” wedding; we had no wedding party/family-oriented customs; Fatima always reassured me whenever stress started creeping in, and always made me/us feel supported and cared for. Not only did Fatima and the team at Momentos plan our wedding, the team assisted in organizing welcome drinks at the Hilton Los Cabos the night before the wedding as well as cabanas for the recovery pool day after. On the wedding day, everything ran flawlessly—we were able to relax and truly enjoy every moment knowing Fatima and Iveta had everything under control. Everything just flowed. It was effortless. Our team handled every detail behind the scenes so that we could be fully present and just enjoy the moment with our guests on our special day. It felt like having a trusted friend by our side every step of the way. We are forever grateful for everything they did to make our wedding such a joyful, stress-free, and unforgettable experience. If you’re looking for a wedding planner who will go above and beyond, book Momentos. We are forever grateful and cannot recommend them enough. With love and gratitude, Frank & Christina

We had a destination wedding in Cancun and Natalia made the entire process effortless. She was incredibly responsive, knowledgeable, and resourceful, finding us everything we wanted (and things we didn’t even know we needed). She gave us the perfect catering and bartending team, kept us from making mistakes, and made sure the whole day ran flawlessly. We couldn’t recommend her more!

Illeana and her team at Romantic Cabo Weddings were wonderful to work with! We signed for her services almost a year and a half before our wedding and she was quick to start working on our dream wedding. No matter the request, she was always receptive and quick to action. I'd recommend any couples that work with her to download Whatsapp and communicate with her on there for anything urgent. Email was great for making larger decisions but she is most responsive on Whatsapp. Illeana was so helpful during the planning process and I can say as a type-A bride, that she was very patient and accommodating to my many requests and questions. But where she and her team shined most was the wedding weekend. She and Jackson made themselves available to us and our guests the entire wedding weekend. They helped facilitate all the logistics during our welcome party and wedding day. They did everything from holding my bridesmaids' bags to answering questions from our guests to corralling our guests to the right place to ensuring we were always on schedule. We're sad to have wrapped up wedding planning because we had a great time planning it with Illeana! She is so kind and you can tell that she truly pours her love and attention to every single couple she works with. We felt all the love and support from our first video chat to the wedding weekend. She checked in on us constantly and made sure everything went off without a hitch.

We truly cannot say enough about Runaway Bride — an exceptional, unbelievable company that exceeded every expectation. Adriana and her team are more than wedding planners; they are family. From the very beginning, they listened to our vision, understood our priorities, and genuinely cared about making our dreams come true. They didn’t just plan our wedding day — they created an entire unforgettable weekend. Every detail was thoughtful, seamless, and beyond anything we could have imagined. What meant so much to us was how mindful they were of our budget. They guided us with honesty, creativity, and care, always offering suggestions that helped us stay within our means without ever sacrificing beauty or experience. Adriana, in particular, was absolutely incredible. She was extremely communicative and responsive at any hour or time of day — truly at our disposal whenever we needed her. Having Adriana plan our wedding gave us zero fear about having a destination wedding in Mexico. She spoke with and handled all of our vendors, removing any stress or uncertainty. Any question we had or help we needed, she immediately handled and answered for us. We had 1000% faith in her, and she delivered in every possible way. Looking back, there is not a single thing we would change. We would do it the exact same way all over again with zero changes. We couldn’t have asked for anyone better and will forever be grateful to Adriana, Natalia and the entire Runaway Bride team for making our dream wedding a reality.

Our wedding day would not have been possible without CBW!!! I am so grateful for their entire team that assisted us throughout the process. Christina made us feel comfortable sharing our ideas, and Magda was our supper star! She was available to answer any question we had at the drop of a text.. We never had a worry! She went above and beyond at every turn and when the big day finally came, I had someone literally at my attention in case I needed anything at all. They helped facilitate vendors, checked my phone for me, helped me in and out of my first look and second, and even made sure we had a private moment to enjoy our cocktail hour food and drinks. Booking CBW was the best decision we made, because they made everything else simpler. I hear about the stress of wedding planning and although there are some major decisions that we needed to make, I feel like we actually got to enjoy the process and the day to the fullest with the help of the CBW team. Thank you all for everything!!
