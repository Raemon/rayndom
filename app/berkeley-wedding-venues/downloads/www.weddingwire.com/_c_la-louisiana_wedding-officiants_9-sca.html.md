Chris was amazing as our wedding officiant! From start to finish, he was professional, attentive, and made us feel completely comfortable. His delivery was heartfelt and thoughtful, and he really helped make our ceremony memorable. We’re so glad we chose him and would absolutely recommend him to anyone looking for a reliable and personable officiant!

We had Danielle act as the officiant for our wedding, and we are thrilled to have made that decision. Danielle was easy to work with, genuine, and overall the right option to have in front of our friends and family on such an important day. In addition to the usual challenges of planning a wedding, we had the added difficulty of being from out of town. At no point were we anything less than confident in our planning process. Danielle carved out phone and video meeting time for us, and provided just enough feedback for us to customize our wedding while keeping us within the guides of the type of ceremony we were looking for. If you're searching to book an officiant for your special day, look no further.

Omg I cannot rave enough about Melanie and Kristi. They are absolutely THE best! Kristi was always so sweet and upfront about all the information! Never made me stress about anything. Everything was cut and dry, no surprises and no problems. And Melanie was THE ABSOLUTE BEST. From the moment we first talked to the special day when we met, we have absolutely adored her. She was so sweet and happy and always made me feel like I wasn’t going crazy! Her script was beautiful and so heartwarming i literally cried the first time I read it. She made everything so easy and calming. It was honestly incredible having her there and I wouldn’t change anything! Definitely recommend 1000%.

Mr Campbell and his wife went above and beyond for us. We met with them a few months prior to our wedding through a FaceTime call and spoke for a while where they addressed all of our concerns and gave his input into the ceremony flow, along with the steps required for us to complete the legal portion of our marriage. The experience the Campbell’s have in officiating shows in how they worked with us to make the wedding a very memorable ceremony. After our initial conversation, we spoke a few more times over the phone while planning our event. The day prior to our wedding we were able to meet them in person and finalize all of the details. The wedding day itself went without any hiccups and they brought us a sense of peace through the full ceremony. We are very grateful for their service to us and they went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we need. I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking to wed in New Orleans and beyond.

I was amazed at how true it was to pictures online and how helpful they were . We had an experience of a lifetime not just as bride and groom but all the guests were complimented how gorgeous it was and saying how the second line alone was worth the trip .
