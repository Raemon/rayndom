Just the best!

All I can say is WOW!! We had our wedding at the Club of Knights just over a month ago and are so happy we did! From the very beginning, the team at COK was so helpful and kind to help me plan our big day. Everything went so smoothly and it’s a testament to the well oiled machine that is the team! The venue itself is beautiful: a gorgeous outdoor garden and hardwood floors in the reception hall. A dream. The food? Delicious! The drinks? Incredible! Everything just came together so seemlessly and we are so thankful for the COK team for all of their hard work. They really made our vision come to life and we will forever remember our perfect day all thanks to them!

Couldn’t recommend COK enough! 

Had my wedding here recently and from the moment I first toured COK I knew they were the venue for me. From beginning to end, my experience with them was great and I seriously couldn’t recommend them enough. Thank you to all the staff for helping make my wedding day so perfect!

Five stars all around!

The Club of Knights is an unassuming venue located a few streets from Miracle Mile. After visiting several venues, this one looked very different from the outside. It wasn't until we stepped inside that we could fully visualize our dream for a downtown Coral Gables wedding.   
From day one, the COK made our wedding experience a breeze. We got to work with Michelle from booking up until our wedding day. She was easy to reach and extremely helpful whenever we had questions. I cannot express enough how grateful we are to have worked with her. The COK offers packages that include all the food & drinks, reception furniture and table settings. They work with all vendors so you are not limited to their preferred list in case you want something different or extra. This made the planning much easier. Disclaimer: we hired a wedding planner, Stephanie from Events by U, who helped bring our vision to life. She helped us coordinate with the COK and all of our vendors.   
The venue itself is beautiful and elegant. You can go all out with decorations or not, it will look stunning. We were able to have our ceremony indoors due to inclement weather and not booking a tent. Our event was in June so the weather always posed a risk. The ceremony was still beautiful and memorable.   
The food was delicious! We had a charcuterie board during the cocktail hour that our guests completely devoured. The bar is huge so there was never a long line for drinks.   
The dance floor, chandeliers and fragrance in the reception room are such a nice touch. We are so happy we chose this venue for our special day !

Best venue

We had our wedding at this venue on September 30th, 2022 and we couldn't be happier with our experience. From start to finish, the team went above and beyond to make our day special and stress-free. The venue itself is stunning, with beautiful grounds and an elegant interior that provided the perfect backdrop for our ceremony and reception. The staff was incredible throughout the entire process, from our initial tour to the day-of coordination. They were always available to answer any questions we had and were extremely accommodating to our needs and preferences. All of the services provided, from the catering to the decorations, surpassed our expectations and made our day truly unforgettable. Overall, we highly recommend this wedding venue to anyone looking for a beautiful and stress-free wedding experience. The team's attention to detail and dedication to making our day perfect made all the difference, and we couldn't have asked for a better venue for our special day. Gigi & Bryan

Great experience

My husband and I had the best experience with CoK. The space is unique but also allows each couple to personalize the space to tailor to their wedding needs. The staff is great. Great food and great service. I would recommend to anyone looking for a venue! While we did not use the outdoor space for our ceremony, the outside space is gorgeous and was a beautiful backdrop for our cocktail hour but would be beautiful to have a ceremony as well!

Love this venue!

This was the first and only venue I looked at after buying my wedding dress two blocks away. It was recommended by one of the ladies at the store who had just gotten married there few months ago. We ended up having a beautiful and intimate ceremony in their outdoor area. Our guests loved the food and open bar. We have received so many compliments from everyone that attended. It was everything we dreamed of and more. Daniella and her team are professional, sweet, and responsive via email. Overall, wonderful experience at Club of Knights. Thank you!! Lucy & Ramis

Best Venue

When my daughter and I visited the Club of Knights we were impressed with Daniella Miranda. Her sweet disposition and professionalism stood out from the beginning. Throughout the planning process she was available to answer questions and she returned calls promptly. Everything was exceptional on our daughter's wedding day. We still get compliments about the wonderful food, drinks and beautiful venue. Thank you to Daniella and her team and Executive Chef Juan Avarez for the delicious food he prepared and for their wonderful customer service.

Best venue!

We knew Club of Knights was our venue since the first time we entered, the atmosphere, the service, and the professionalism are out of this world. This was the first and last venue we saw, from when we entered the doors we knew this was where we were going to have our wedding party here. We first met with Jenny and Daniella and they were the sweetest and most understanding. They worked with us and accommodated ours wants our needs while going above and beyond. Every time we had a question or concern they would answer us and work with us. Diana who started working later on with them was also very professional and helpful. What can we say than the day of our wedding it was a total dream. We loved that we had three spaces for guests, the bar, the outside, and the banquet hall. Everyone loved the venue, the décor, food, and drinks were amazing. One thing we still get told is that the venue and the service were the best they have ever seen. We were truly blessed to have our wedding party in the Club of Knights because it was way more than we could have asked for. We urge everyone to book this as their venue, we were truly blessed with the Club of Knights and all of their staff.

Best venue ever!!

The absolute best venue in South Florida and the best decision my now husband and I made when planning our wedding. After seeing several venues we ended our search with Club of Knights and it was an amazing experience from the start.   
  
Everything here is perfect. You want it? They have it or they’ll find a way to get it.   
  
The food… spectacular. The service… incredible. The venue… breathtaking.   
  
It’s been over a week since our wedding and we haven’t stopped receiving messages from all our guests about how perfect everything was and it’s 100% because of Club of Knights.   
  
Do yourself a favor and have your wedding here. You won’t regret it.
