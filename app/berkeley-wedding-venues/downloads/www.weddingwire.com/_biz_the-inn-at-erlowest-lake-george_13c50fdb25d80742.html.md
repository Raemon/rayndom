Vanderhoff Lake George Wedding 

From the very first tour to the final moments of our wedding day, LeAnna at The Inn at Erlowest was an absolute dream to work with. She guided us through every step of the planning process with warmth, professionalism, and genuine care, always making us feel supported and heard.  
LeAnna and her incredible team brought our vision to life with such grace and attention to detail—it truly was the perfect day. We are endlessly grateful for their dedication and talent.  
The Inn at Erlowest will forever hold a special place in our hearts, and we’re already looking forward to the day we return.

Best wedding venue ever!

My husband and I were lucky enough to book Erlowest as our wedding venue this September and I can’t say enough positive things about it! It was truly the best day of our lives thanks to the lovely staff at Erlowest. The food was out of this world delicious and the service/accommodations left nothing to be desired. Every single person there was so kind and helpful. The venue itself is beyond gorgeous. Leanna and Molly specifically made sure I had absolutely no worries on our big day. We had many tough critics at our wedding and SEVERAL guests reached out to note that it was the best wedding they had ever been to! I feel so lucky to have been able to get married here and you will not regret booking it for your special day!

A Dream Come True Wedding-- Beyond Expectations

As a detail-oriented person who values exceptional customer service, I can honestly say that our experience with Molly and LeAnna and the venue in Lake George far exceeded every expectation we had. From the very first consultation to the final send-off at the end of our wedding night, every single detail was executed flawlessly.  
  
The venue itself is absolutely breathtaking – nestled in the heart of Lake George with panoramic views that made for the most stunning backdrop. But what truly made the experience unforgettable was the level of professionalism, care, and dedication from the entire planning team. They were responsive, organized, and proactive – always three steps ahead, which allowed me to relax and truly enjoy the planning process (something I never thought I'd say!).  
  
Molly has a rare gift for understanding a couple's vision and bringing it to life with warmth, precision, and creativity. Everything they recommended was top-tier, every timeline was perfectly orchestrated, and every personal touch we hoped for was thoughtfully included. They treated our wedding as if it were their own – and that made all the difference.  
  
If you’re planning a wedding in Lake George and want an unforgettable, stress-free experience that truly honors your vision, look no further. We are endlessly grateful!

Amazing! Highly Recommend

LeAnna, Laurie, and the entire Erlowest team did an absolutely amazing job with our wedding. From the very beginning, they were incredibly organized, thoughtful, and friendly — every call and email leading up to our big day was prompt, productive, and reassuring. We truly felt supported every step of the way and are so happy we chose the Erlowest.  
  
On the day itself, everything was flawless. From the golf carts shuttling our guests around the property to the fabulous food and attentive bartenders, every detail was handled with care and professionalism. Our guests couldn’t stop raving about the service and the overall experience.  
  
The property itself is breathtaking — the stunning views and historic charm created the perfect backdrop for our celebration. But what truly set the Erlowest apart was the peace of mind we had, knowing that LeAnna, Laurie, and the rest of the team were managing every detail behind the scenes. Because of them, we were able to be fully present and simply enjoy our day without any stress or distractions.  
  
We can’t recommend the Erlowest enough to any couple looking for an unforgettable, seamless wedding experience!

10/10 experience!

We recently had our wedding at Erlowest and it was the most incredible weekend! From start to finish, Erlowest was so accommodating and helpful, and helped make the wedding planning process run so smoothly, which was especially helpful as we live out of state. LeAnna, Laurie, and Molly were a dream to work with, and truly made our wedding weekend absolute perfection- our vision came to life and we could not be happier. I cannot recommend Erlowest and their team enough!

They made our dream a reality!

From the moment we toured the Inn at Erlowest, we knew it was something special. What truly sets this venue apart isn’t just its stunning beauty (though it is breathtaking) but the way they make you feel like your wedding is the only thing that matters. They only host one wedding per day, and it shows—you truly feel like the princess of the castle.  
  
The staff was absolutely incredible. Jaimee, LeAnna, Molly, and Laura were with us every step of the way—always communicative, endlessly patient, and genuinely excited to bring our vision to life. They made sure every detail was perfect, and their day-of coordination lifted so much stress off my shoulders. I never had to worry about a thing.  
  
The venue itself is gorgeous, but the experience they provide is what makes it unforgettable. We had so many opportunities to customize our day, and one of the most special moments was our private, no-look vows—something the venue helped us arrange perfectly.  
  
And the food? Absolutely incredible. Our guests couldn’t stop raving about it.  
  
The Inn at Erlowest didn’t just host our wedding—they made our dream of a perfect winter wedding come true. If you’re considering this venue, stop thinking and book it. You won’t regret it.

Dream Wedding!

Right from the second we toured the venue we knew this was where we wanted our wedding!   
  
After booking our date we were introduced to Jaimee. She was truly great to work with from start to finish. Anytime I sent an email with a question she responded within a day. Never once did I have to follow up on anything. I couldn’t have been more happy with the communication and service.  
  
The day of our wedding ended up being the most perfect day. We dropped off a ton of decor for the team to set up and everything was set up perfectly. We literally felt like we were the king and queen being driven around in golf carts to all the locations and listening to Jaimee and LeAnna talk on their headsets!   
  
Aside from the venue being absolutely gorgeous the food was fantastic. The packages include so much that your guests will definitely not leave hungry.  
  
We had so many guests tell us at the end of the night our wedding was the best wedding they’ve ever been to! We couldn’t have been happier. The only problem is that we wish we could do it all over again!   
  
Thank you so much to the Erlowest staff for literally making this the best day of our lives! We will never forget this.

Fairytale Wedding Venue on Lake George

My Husband and I got married at the Inn at Erlowest in October 2023. We always knew our wedding day would be amazing, but it seriously wouldn’t have been the same if we hadn’t chosen to have our wedding at the Inn at Erlowest. My family has gone to Lake George my whole life, so I always knew getting married up there was the dream, and as soon as we stepped foot at Erlowest we knew we found the most amazing place. First of all, the venue is breathtaking and the accommodations on site were so convenient to have, and so well kept! What really stole our hearts though, was the team of people they have. Jaimie was our coordinator throughout the process of wedding planning, as well as LeAnna, and they seriously took care of everything for us. I would have been so stressed, but with them everything was easy! If there was any hiccup on the wedding day, we never knew about it because everything was handled that perfectly. I could rave about the team all day. And the food! Seriously everything was delicious from cocktail hour to the entrees. My husband and I would choose this venue and this team to work with time and time again if we had to do it all over. The Inn at Erlowest and the team there will forever hold a special place in our hearts, and we are looking forward to going back for years to come for anniversaries, special occasions, etc. Do yourself a favor and book your wedding with this wonderful team!!!

Simply the best!

The best wedding weekend of our lives! The Inn & its employees go above and beyond to make your day the most special and burden free day of it all! There is nothing like the attention to detail, care and support that the Inn and its staff supply. The grounds are incredible, the ability to have all our family and friends stay on property if they so wished and their flexibility on the wedding details to provide what the bride and groom wished to see in their day is unlike any other event and planning team I’ve seen. Our family and friends cannot stop talking about this weekend! We are truly amazed with the quality of service we were provided. We wish we could get married all over again!!!
