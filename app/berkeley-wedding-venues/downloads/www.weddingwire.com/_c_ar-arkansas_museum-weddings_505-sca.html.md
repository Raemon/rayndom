Valet is excellent along with the service from the front desk. The food is always stellar. Great experience.

Our wedding day at Crystal Bridges was more magical than we envisioned. Every time we visit the museum we remember the remarkable day with our loved ones and the team that helped bring it to life. The venue itself is stunning and large. The ambiance was romantic, fun, and elegant, creating a dreamy atmosphere. We went with the plated dinner options with perfectly cooked steak, salmon, and a mushroom option. The museum has high expectations for themselves and truly went above and beyond for our wedding. It’s an all inclusive option - food, drink, reception, ceremony, security, lighting, personnel and staff, and, of course, a magical experience - which makes planner that much easier.

I was married here in the fall of 2021. We decided to do both our ceremony and reception here and are so glad we did. We were at first worried about how photographs would look after the ceremony because of the lack of vegetation but the backdrop of the airfield is just scenic. The staff was friend and almost overly helpful.
