Phoenix Hill absolutely blew us away with their wedding flowers! We asked for seasonal/fall colors, and they went above and beyond! The arrangements and bouquets were breathtaking, and I don’t think I’ll ever find another flower arrangement that compares. They were so easy to work with and even helped us out with our last-minute request. Not only that, but they were incredibly caring, sweet, and I could totally feel the love they put into our flowers. It was a real treat to chat with both of them before and after the event. I would highly recommend Phoenix Hill and would definitely order from them again if we ever find ourselves back in Louisville. Oh, and guess what? We were traveling and couldn’t take the flowers with us, so we decided to spread the love by passing them out to locals over the weekend. These flowers made their way throughout the city of Louisville and brought joy to everyone they met. We ordered two arrangements for the ceremony, an additional table arrangement, and two bouquets for our mothers.

Sarah was wonderful to work with and we would highly recommend hiring Rosealia for your wedding or any special event! My husband and I had to postpone our wedding twice due to the pandemic and our original florist was unavailable on our rescheduled date. We are so happy we found Rosealia and that they were able to accommodate all of our needs with only a few months notice. They put together a package to come as close as possible to our original budget and everything from set-up to breakdown service was completely seamless and affordable. Our flowers were absolutely beautiful! Thank you Roselia for being an awesome part of our wedding day!

I can't say enough about Jeanie - she is amazing! She followed my daughter's vision perfectly and provided the most beautiful flowers I've ever seen. She did our welcome party & wedding with absolute perfection! I don't even think the pics we found on Pinterest hold up to the magic Jeanie did with her flowers. She is a true professional & I would recommend her HIGHLY! Our welcome party was held at the Andover Carson's and wedding was at Fasig-Tipton; Jeanie provided timeless arrangements that fit the elegance of our events perfectly. She also provided an extra bouquet on the day of the wedding we had mistakenly miscounted. She saved the day & it was absolutely perfect!! I can't say enough great things - you will not be disappointed.

I was thrilled with Imperial Flowers’ work with my wedding. Their arrangements were beautiful, elegant and perfect for the occasion… They were prompt in decorating the venue and sought my feedback throughout the process. I would highly recommend them to anyone for any occasion.

Working with Marketa at Nanz & Kraft was amazing. Our correspondence was almost all via email since my husband and I live in Texas, but we were getting married in Louisville. I basically sent over pictures of what I was thinking for my bouquet and centerpieces. We talked color palettes, and Marketa took that information and ran with it. In no time at all she was emailing me an itemized PDF breaking down the flowers in season for the wedding, what specific flowers have the colors we want, and then listed all the prices for each floral (centerpiece ~$100, bridal bouquet ~$200, corsages ~$25, boutineer ~$10), and a general description of what would be in it. On the day of the wedding, I could not believe how beautiful the florals were. My bouquet was almost exactly like the pictures I sent them. They perfectly captured what I wanted and matched the picture in my head. I could no be happier. Also, for centerpieces and whatnot, they have all sorts of vases, stands, candles, etc. that they will let you use to complete your centerpiece "look" you're going for.

Wildflowers Florist at 2406 S Preston St, Louisville, KY 40217 did the seven bouquets, five boutonnieres and two corsages for my wedding and they were absolutely gorgeous. On top of it the florist gave us a 20% discount even though when we first arrived he advised it was not the place for a budget. I also ordered a flower basket for a relative's funeral about a week prior to the wedding and it was even more beautiful than the photo on their site.
