The Madison in Cottage Grove, MN exceeded all of our expectations as a wedding venue. The space is stunning, well-organized, and thoughtfully designed for both the ceremony and reception. We hosted 130 guests, and everything flowed seamlessly with both the ceremony and reception held indoors. Tinucci’s catering was excellent, and the coordination between the venue and caterer made the entire experience stress-free. Owners, Brad + Louise Madison are wonderful to work with not only are they professional, attentive, they’re incredibly supportive throughout the planning process and on the day of our wedding. Everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy our day. We received countless compliments from guests and would highly recommend The Madison to any couple looking for an exceptional wedding venue.

My husband and I truly could not be happier that we chose Legacy Hill Farm. The venue itself is beautiful - gorgeous landscape, the iconic fountain, the perfect mix between rustic and chic. Our May wedding was a little chillier than expected but it worked out perfectly with all the heaters around the bar area and the floor to ceiling windows shut. It still gave the essence of a perfect "outdoor" wedding with all the natural light beaming through but ensured all the guests were comfortable. I also loved the lay out of the venue. Each area (pavilion/dance floor, bar, bathrooms, fire pit, etc.) was perfectly spread out. Not too much that you couldn't drag someone out to the dance floor within a seconds notice, but also enough to get away from the loud music and catch up with your friends. Joan was amazing to work with - she's professional, friendly, and so easy to communicate with. She made sure the day ran smoothly along with the rest of the Legacy Hill Farm staff. Will be recommending to everyone (since I already want to go back)!

The venue speaks for itself! Every photo turns out amazing! The staff is so helpful and answers every question. It's really has everything you need from getting ready rooms to beautiful indoor and outdoor locations for the ceremony and an amazing reception space, and rentable decor. If I did it all again I wouldn't change a thing!

My wife and I got married at the Braham event center. The event center coordinators were very helpful on making sure our day went amazing! The venue is also very spacious with a spot for the groom and grooms men and bride and bridesmaids to get ready for the wedding. They were also very accommodating on allowing us to set up our decorations a day early. The food was also very delicious and so was the coffee and lemonade! We went with the Chicken and lemon sauce. If you have ant dietary restrictions to account for, they also will work with you to ensure you can meet those! And to top it off, Braham was so much cheaper than any other venue we looked at! Highly Highly Highly recommend Braham for your wedding!

I held my wedding at Divanyx Event center on September 13th 2024. Divanyx was so accommodating with our unique Friday the Thirteenth Wedding! It was an AMAZING venue with so many additional great add ons for a great price! The venue provided a day of coordinator who was extremely helpful throughout our day, I loved working with the staff here and getting to know them and about the property. I’m so glad we picked Divanyx for our big day!

We set up a weekend to tour a handful of venues in the Walker, MN area. When we drove into the entrance at Pine Peaks, we knew this was our place. We got married in July of 2024 and booked the reception hall and retreat house Thursday-Sunday. We had immediate family and our small wedding parties stay with us in the retreat house and invited extended family out to see the venue on Friday evening after our rehearsal. Everyone loved everything the venue had to offer. We heard many times that it was an "experience" not just a wedding weekend. The retreat house and extended rental helps you really enjoy the weekend and those surrounding you on your special day. Priscilla officiated our wedding, and she is made for this job in every way. She has such a calm but organized and structured way about her. We never worried that things were going to go off without a hitch. We loved that we got to go visit the venue for a catering menu tasting, and we were treated like royalty when we were there! We settled on the BBQ meal, and the guests RAVED about the food for weeks to come. David really knocked it out of the park with that one. You won't be disappointed if you make a visit to Pine Peaks, and I highly suggest booking this venue if you're looking for a beautiful venue and amazing hosts!

This venue was stunning and we fell in love instantly. It was so beautiful on its own, decorating only enhanced everything. The trees, hills etc. could not have been a better backdrop. They were communicative, open, very responsive, and detailed. I also felt is was quite affordable for the space and compared to other venues. Our wedding was on a Sunday which was cheaper too. We got so many compliments on our day and the setting.

Our September wedding at Maple Ridge Farm was the best day we could have asked for. We took one look at MRF on a January -10 day and knew it was the perfect place for our wedding of 150 people. Sue and the team made our day run without a hitch. Maple Ridge Farm checked off every single item from our wedding day dream checklist and we couldn't recommend this place more! The venue: We picked MRF because there was an outdoor venue where you could get married against the backdrop of a beautiful eastern Minnesota farm background. Our ceremony was done under a homemade arch with our guests seated on provided benches. From there, we loved that we could host a dinner in a designated "dinner barn" with room for plenty of tables plus buffet tables, with a seperate drinks and dancing space in the "dancing barn" (as we called it). The three spaces flowed together perfectly and there were beautifully curated and well-kept spaces throughout the property where guests could be found giggling, drinking, taking photos and celebrating. Sue and team lit a bonfire when the sun went down and we added on woodfire grilled pizzas cooked by Sue and team onsite for our midnight snack (bomb). One of the other best parts of the property was a beautiful farmhouse where the bridesmaids stayed the night before and the bride and groom stayed the night of the wedding. We added it onto our rental for an extra $1000 and it was awesome to have as a place to freshen up and get drinks throughout the night. We also used the "dinner barn" to host our rehearsal dinner the night before the wedding and this worked super well! It felt like the property was ours for the entire weekend, which added to the experience. The experience: All around amazing. Every need we had was immediately met and Sue was an absolute blessing to work with. We felt like family the entire weekend. The only slight negative was that hotels were located across the river in Wisconsin so we had to rent party busses to take guests home at the end of the night (no reliable Ubers or taxis). The bottom line: If you are looking for a romantic, rustic(ish) beautiful venue with the right mix of charming old buildings and gorgeous greenery and scenery, pick Maple Ridge Farm. It was also well-priced and there were no hidden fees. Additionally, the vendors that Sue recommends working with are awesome and did a great job.

## Minnesota Barn Wedding Venues: Your Wedding Venue Planning Guide for Minnesota and Beyond

Rustic romance abounds throughout the North Star State. Farms and parks are plentiful, with nearly 40 percent of land defined as “rural” in 2017. Situated in the upper part of the Midwest and sharing a border with Canada, nature plays a key role throughout the state. Besides this, the Twin Cities and smaller locales serve as hubs of cultural influence. Mighty literary and musical legends such as Sinclair Lewis, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Prince, and Bob Dylan were all born in the state. Diversity in atmosphere and ambience are easy to come by. Chic, sophisticated, countryside charm: these attributes and more can be applied to weddings hosted at the many venues to choose from.

## Lakes and Lush Landscapes

The production of dairy is heavily important to Minnesota and its economy. It is no surprise then at the abundance of barns that dot the landscape, built during different eras. This difference in history has given rise to varying architectural details, from classic red barns over 100 years old to new builds that are unabashedly modern. No matter the choice of location, Minnesota barn wedding venues feature tree-lined vistas and clear freshwater lakes nearby. You can celebrate with your loved ones in a covered shelter of bucolic sophistication or have your chosen DJ play songs under the splendor of stars.

## Midwestern Neighbors: Weddings in Wisconsin

Wisconsin, next door to The Gopher State, boasts similar natural and rural features. Agriculture likewise factors heavily into the economy. As such, it is not hard to find rolling hills of farmland that ebb and flow into reserves of forests, much like Minnesota. State and national parks, such as Devil’s Lake State Park and the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, are only the tip of the iceberg in terms of natural recreation sites.

## Winter Wonderlands to Sunny Summers

Minnesotans often jest that there are two seasons in the state: winter and construction. Jokes aside, the state in reality experiences all four seasons in equal measure. Winters are marked by immensely cool temperatures often complemented by blankets of snow. This then fades into longer and warmer days of spring until finally settling into hot and humid summers. Come fall you can expect hues of orange, yellow, and red to mark the trees creating postcard-worthy views. The days grow shorter and cooler, with average temperatures in the month of October at around 58 degrees F. Each month of the year offers you the chance to plan a wedding with a seasonal theme, topics you can discuss with your wedding planner.

## In the Loop

  * What is the average cost of a venue in Minnesota?

$6,000.

  * What documents do I need to get married in Minnesota?

A marriage license and state issued ID.

  * How long after you obtain a marriage license do you have to get married?

6 months and you need one at least 5 days before your are supposed to get married.
