Charlie joined our wedding team as a day-of coordinator very late in the process, and my fiancée and I were honestly so worried things might fall apart. From the moment she stepped in, she completely took charge — organizing vendors, keeping everyone accountable, helping us with décor decisions, and making sure every little detail was covered. She went way above and beyond her role, and our day ran perfectly because of her. If we could do it all over again, we’d 100% hire Charlie for full-service planning. Still so impressed by her professionalism, calm energy, and genuine care.

Our experience with Designed by Nelle was more than exceptional! Firstly, Nelle was well organized, patient, empathetic, a great listener and an executor. Her drive is focused on exactly what the clients’ needs and wants are, sticking within budget. Our wedding was EXACTLY what we dreamed of and surpassed our expectations! Her professionalism made it easy for us to trust and leave everything in her hands. Words can’t express how pleased we’re with the service. Thank you for making our wedding day and planning a pleasant one! Would definitely recommend! Love, Janicq and Jean

We couldn't have asked for a better experience with Thouzand Wordz Inc. They truly helped make our wedding feel like 'Our Happily Ever After'. From the very first contact, we felt a sense of relief and ease, knowing that our special event was both in professional as well as spiritual hands. Regarding value for money, they were respectful with our budget and worked along with us in preparing a contract which catered to both our needs and wants. Their level of professionalism was top-notch; in fact, it exceeded our expectations. Throughout the entire process, Marcus, our planner, maintained a calm and humble attitude even when we made changes to the original plan. ​ We highly recommend Thousand Wordz Inc. to any couple looking for a dedicated and professional planner. Everything is done for you; all you need to do is show up and enjoy your wonderful day.

My husband and I wanted a laid back, intimate wedding, and overall didn't care much about the details and decor. Louanne and team went above and beyond to make sure we didn't have to worry about anything. The decor was PERFECT-- simple, elegant, and some tropical boho details. She also handled logistics seamlessly, from transportation to a hair dresser to steel drum ceremony music. When my photographer cancelled a couple weeks before, Louanne booked a new amazing photographer (Peter Rameau) before even telling me the news. She also volunteered to help with our rehearsal dinner at Orlando's which was incredible. Having never been to St. Lucia before the wedding, we went in blind and trusting Louanne with everything. And it was the best decision we could've made! She is so talented and full of so much joy, love and great advice. Would 100% recommend to anyone.
