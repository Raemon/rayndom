Highly recommend 

Leigh and the entire Lago Bella staff were  
ABSOLUTELY amazing! We can't imagine how it would have gone with out them. Leigh and her team went ABOVE AND BEYOND to ensure me and my now husband had the night we dreamed of. From asking us if we needed anything any chance they saw us, to helping us pick up at the end of the night. They were super professional and had great communication with us. The venue is  
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL day and night and the property just adds the perfect touch! We HUGHLY recommend booking the Pavilion at Lago Bella for your special event!

Our December Wedding

We had an amazing experience with The Pavilion at Lago Bela, and we truly cannot say enough great things about Faye, our wedding coordinator. From the very beginning and throughout the entire year of planning, Faye was incredibly helpful, organized, and supportive every step of the way.  
  
She guided us through vendor coordination, timelines, and all the details that come with wedding planning, making the process feel manageable and stress-free. Her attention to detail and constant communication gave us so much peace of mind, and she always made sure nothing fell through the cracks. On our wedding day, everything ran smoothly, allowing us to fully enjoy the moment without worrying about logistics.  
  
Having Faye as part of the venue package at The Pavilion at Lago Bela was an incredible value and truly elevated our entire experience. The venue itself is beautiful, and the coordination and professionalism exceeded our expectations. We are so grateful for all of Faye’s hard work and highly recommend her and The Pavilion at Lago Bela to any couple planning their wedding.

Groom Approved: Truly an Unforgettable Venue

My wedding at The Pavilion at Lago Bella in May 2025 was an absolute dream from start to finish. The moment we drove up and saw the lake, the island ceremony spot, and the beautiful pavilion, we knew this was where we wanted to say “I do.” The setting is even more gorgeous in person – the water, the trees, and the open, airy feel of the pavilion made it feel like our own little world for the day. The staff was wonderful throughout the process. They were patient with all our questions, quick to respond, and genuinely cared about helping us have the day we envisioned. On the wedding day itself, everything ran so smoothly behind the scenes that we were able to just relax, be present, and enjoy every moment with our family and friends. Our guests raved about the venue – from the stunning views at sunset to how comfortable and welcoming the reception space felt. Looking back, choosing The Pavilion at Lago Bella was one of the best decisions we made. If you want a venue that’s beautiful, romantic, and run by people who truly care, I can’t recommend it enough.

1000% Love Lago Bella!

I cannot say enough amazing things about Lago Bella. From the moment I arrived, the team was warm, kind, and incredibly attentive. They went above and beyond in every possible way, making the entire experience feel effortless and truly magical. I genuinely felt like a princess all day long.  
  
The staff anticipated every need before I even had to ask, offering support with a smile and making sure every detail was perfect. The atmosphere of the venue itself is breathtaking. It's beautiful, elegant, and full of charm. It created the fairytale backdrop I had always dreamed of.  
  
If you’re looking for a wedding venue that is not only stunning but also run by a family that truly cares about making your day unforgettable, look no further. Lago Bella exceeded every expectation. I will cherish the memories we made here forever.

Affordable All-Inclusive Weddings Exist

I never saw this venue until the night before the wedding but I was so relieved and pleasantly surprised at how beautiful and peaceful it was. Being family owned, I feel as if we were welcomed "home"! The all-inclusive package made every moment of the wedding planning and the day of the event flow so smoothly and stress-free. Our coordinator Faye was truly a Godsend and while she kept everyone and everything on schedule, she was so sweet throughout the entire process. The fact that we didn't have to worry about all the moving parts - made us able to enjoy every part of the day. The venue is naturally beautiful and so warm but, the surroundings to include the island pavilion, bridge and lake made it so peaceful. It's like we were in our own little slice of paradise. I highly recommend Lago Bella and I would redo the day over and over again! Thank you for helping us start our "forever"!

Fabulous Experience—Did it Twice

Two of my daughters were married at this magnificent venue. The owners are caring and attentive. This isn't corporate owned and the attention to details shows in every detail. The entire property is like a lake resort. Our guests were so impressed. We had fireworks at the end of their events that mirrored over the lake. Just perfect memories. Choose The Pavilion at Lago Bella for a wonderful experience for your friends and family!

Best. Day. Ever. 

From the moment we toured, we knew this was gonna be the venue for us - and we were right. The staff were so attentive and kind. We didn’t have to worry about a thing. Every time I had a question, the owner and coordinator were one step ahead of me on everything. I even forgot our cake topper on our wedding day, and they ran around town to find me a new one. They guided me through the process with kindness and patience. Truly good people.

Mother of the groom

The Pavilion at Vida Bela was the ideal picturesque venue for a celebration with the newlyweds, my son and his bride. Michel and her team provided all the support and services needed to create memories that last a lifetime. With plenty of outdoor unique and beautiful backdrops for wedding photographs. The spacious indoor wooden featured pavilion elegantly decorated with colourful flowers and fine white linens adds to the luxury of this venue. We celebrated with fine cuisine, signature drinks and enticing desserts finally heading into the evening of dancing by a great DJ. A wonderful time had by all.
