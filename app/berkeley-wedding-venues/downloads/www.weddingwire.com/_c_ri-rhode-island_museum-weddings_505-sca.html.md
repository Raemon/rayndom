We couldn't have asked for a better venue for our 170 person late September wedding! Alyssa and her team were kind, attentive, professional, and helped us execute an incredibly special day. All of our guests couldn't stop raving about how beautiful and historic the venue was. Everyone loved being by the water and getting to check out the Hall of Boats during our cocktail hour. There were so many special touches like getting to ring a large bell to signal the end of our cocktail hour, firing a cannon between the cocktail hour and our reception, and allowing us to fly a flag of our choice on our wedding day.

Yep. I said it. It was a whale of a good time. This venue was perfect for us. Both of us love the ocean--from swimming, to diving, to fishing. Our guests were really WOW-ed from the ceremony in the auditorium, to the cocktail hour in the Lagoda, to the reception upstairs. Ceremony- I loved having my ceremony in the auditorium, because I didn't have to decorate (there was already a ship model for a back drop on stage). I also knew that my guests were comfortable in padded seats and air conditioning (you're welcome, guests). Lagoda- Our photographer got some AMAZING shots of us in this room before the ceremony. We also had our cocktail hour here and my small, acoustic band, was able to play a few songs on the ship during the ceremony. This was priceless. Reception- The reception upstairs was just right for the size of wedding we had. The dance floor was perfect, but I also know a lot of guests spent time outside savoring the view from the deck and enjoying the fresh air. The venue was unique and beautiful and resulted in a very memorable wedding. Our guests were raving about it. I would recommend this venue!
