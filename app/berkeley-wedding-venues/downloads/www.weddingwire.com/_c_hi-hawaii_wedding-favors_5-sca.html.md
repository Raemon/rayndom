The staff at the Paperie are very nice. They don't hover over you like at the other stores - which I prefer. They have a nice selection in the back of the store and have tables on which you can browse the binders. If you're looking for something extravagant, this might now be the place to look, but they do have quite a selection to choose from in a variety of prices.

Our favorite lilikoi (passion fruit) jam from Mr. Ed's Bakery in Big Island was a must at our wedding. We wanted to share our love of breakfast with everyone else! This jam is absolutely delicious and on top of that low in sugar! Our first jar was a gift from my boss and from then on we were hooked! So when I spoke to June and Sheilah from Mr. Ed's Bakery it was always a joy to work with them! Note: I provided them the jam jars from another company but I think they are willing to provide them as well at an extra cost of course.

I don’t know how I stumbled across shop toast, but it is a store based in Honolulu that has some really creative hand made items. I choose to have their tiki woodland warrior heart stumps as my favor filled with a bag of Maui chocolates. (http://www.shoptoast.com/shopstore/woodlandwarriors.html) The little containers turned out great and I was able to have ‘Mahalo for joining us’ printed on it along with our names and wedding date. They were so cute and perfect..and they looked awesome on the table!!

My husband and I met in Hawaii and had a "lavender-themed" wedding. We love all things nature and decided to have lavender soap from Hawaii made for our wedding favors. The NSSF created a custom stamp and sent us more than enough soaps, as well as bags for them, in plenty of time for the big day. They were a hit and really tied in great with the whole wedding. All of their other products are amazing too- I purchased a variety of lavender scented bath products as thank yous for some of my vendors and they loved them.

This is a store in Ward Centre that has great gifts and home decor. They also do favors and I got the Aunty Nalani's Cookies. They are delicious hawaiian made chocolate chip cookies (mini) that come in a beautiful handmade Lauhala box. You can pick your color ribbon and they have a ton of colors. Then you pick a tropical flower or a beautiful sea shell that they put on top the box. It was beautiful and people are still asking where they can find those cookies.

I used Hawaiian Paradise Candies for my favors. They customized these huge delicious fortune cookies for us and it was a great value for the customization and taste/look. If I had one complaint, it would be that I didn't get a proof beforehand (and I'd forgotten until too late to ask. I was planning so many things!). If I had seen it before I would have asked for it in color font but other than that I was grateful they were able to do multiple messages that I wrote for the cookies which made it fun for my guests. The cookies taste great and they had them done when I asked. Would use them again for an event that needed a special touch. Great value!

We wanted our guests to take a part of Big Island back home with after joining our wedding... And Jane's amazing customized gifts of handmade Kona coffee soap scrub, Hawaiian sea bath salts and her signature Lavender by the Sea foot butter were in perfect travel sizes for our guests. She worked with our budget and short timing and just went above and beyond. We highly recommend her products if you like Hawaiian spirited, parabens/sulfate free, natural conscious body care!
