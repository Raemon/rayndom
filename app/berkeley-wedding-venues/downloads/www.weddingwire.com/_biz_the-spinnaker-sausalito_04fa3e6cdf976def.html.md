Jeff and his team are amazing. I could not be more thrilled with how they handled my wedding. Everything went off without a hitch! Jeff is exceptionally accommodating, understanding and patient.   
  
The location site is breathtaking. Floor to ceiling glass windows looking out onto gorgeous blue water, sailboats, and hills in the distance. From the balcony, you have a beautiful view of the San Francisco city skyline.   
  
The food is delicious. My guests still comment about the food and hors d'oeuvre selection. The service was impeccable. There was never an empty wine glass in sight :)  
  
Overall, two thumbs up. Best place ever.

Katy at The Spinnaker was amazing! She helped me with everything from setting up to where to put the cake table. The entire staff was wonderful. The pricing is very reasonable. We loved that this reception venue had the option for our guests to be indoors and outdoors. The bar was set up outside along with some small tables for our guests. I highly recommend having your wedding reception here!!!!

Jeff Scharosch and his crew at the Spinnaker Restaurant did a truly fantastic job of hosting our wedding. The setting was unreal (still getting emails from guests a month later saying it was the prettiest spot they've ever visited), and the service was top-notch. Jeff was a wonderful producer for the entire event, and made things move seamlessly (both ceremony and reception on-site). Jeff was very easy to work with, and had great ideas when we needed them. We couldn't have asked for a better location, better service, or a more magnificent wedding. Thanks Jeff & Team!

This restaurant was one of my favorite locations when we starting searching.  
We were able to have our ceremony on the deck which was awesome.  
They were extremely flexible with all our vendors, especially to setup ALL the decor with got.  
The best part is there menu prices were reasonable, considering the location.  
Friendly staff was helpful at our wedding.  
  
We are very happy with what we paid for.

Disappointing Experience with Poor Coordination and Unexpected Charges

Unfortunately, my experience with the spinnaker fell short of my expectations due to a series of issues that significantly impacted my wedding day. I’d like to share a few key points from my experience that I feel future clients should consider:  
  
1\. Headcount & Billing: Despite providing a final headcount in writing, my request was overlooked, leading to an overcharge on food. This lack of attention to detail was disappointing, especially as it involved additional, unexpected costs.  
2\. Bar Management: The bar service was poorly managed, resulting in alcohol waste and continued service beyond the agreed-upon last call time. This created additional charges that were not anticipated and undermined our agreed plans.  
3\. Coordination Challenges: The coordinator seemed focused on profit over client satisfaction, which made for a stressful planning process. Many of my requests were disregarded or minimized, which ultimately led to a day that didn’t fully reflect the vision I had communicated. Zorana is not ones sent to work with. She had it out for me, the bride, through the whole process. Unpleasant experience.   
  
In summary, while the spinnaker has a lot of potential, my experience was marred by a lack of client consideration and unclear billing practices. I would recommend future clients be very clear and vigilant in their agreements if choosing this venue.
