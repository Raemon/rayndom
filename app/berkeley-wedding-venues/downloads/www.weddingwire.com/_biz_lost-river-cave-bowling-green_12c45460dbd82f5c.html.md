Breathtaking 

“Breathtaking” is how all my guests described my wedding. Truthfully they were speechless because of how beautiful it was. The staff was fabulous! Maegan is THE BEST! The Lost River cave is a must have for any upcoming events. If you want to really wow your guests, have the most gorgeous place for pictures, and have an event of a lifetime book it. We got married almost a month ago and I still have guests calling me telling me how absolutely beautiful it was.

Perfect for a dark romantic nature wedding 

My husband and I got married here in October and the venue was absolutely breathtaking. My guests went on and on the entire time about how gorgeous the wedding was. Meagan and her staff were absolutely amazing and also allowed our pups to be part of the wedding. We had Olive Garden cater in (saved us a ton and was easy set up for them) and didn’t run into a single issue the day of. It was genuinely everything I could have ever asked for. I would recommend this place over and over again! Thank you so much Lost River team!

Highly recommend!

Our son was married on 6/28 at Lost River. As we are not from Bowling Green, the bride’s mother suggested holding the rehearsal dinner in the River Birch Room which is the meeting room at Lost River. It worked perfectly. Maegan in the office was so helpful in making these arrangements. She was timely and helpful in her communication. All the contacts were managed electronically, which was a dream since we live in Georgia. Every staff member who was on site for the wedding was cheerful and helpful. The visual impact of the cave and the river is worth every penny. If you are looking for a venue that offers space for all the wedding festivities, but outside of the box, Lost River is it.

Five Stars

We got compliments from so many guests that this was the best wedding they had ever been too, how beautiful it was etc. I would do everything the same exact way if I had to do it over. I toured a few other venues before I found this one and they were okay, but when I saw this one in person I knew instantly that it was it. Maegan and all of the other staff members were so kind and responsive from the first day I visited, and all throughout the day-of! Thank you LRC for your part in making our day the best one yet!

Literally a Dream venue

This venue was absolutely PERFECT for us! It was well within our budget and considerably affordable compared to other venues in the area. It easily hosted our large wedding and it was BEAUTIFUL!! The ceremony site and the venue area's natural beauty have got to be the prettiest thing in Bowling Green. Maegan and the staff at Lost River Cave were extremely professional, reliable, and so easy to work with. Maegan was flexible with our last minute changes, and even helped us look for some lost items the day after the wedding.   
  
When it came to the actual wedding day, I was blown away by how put together the staff was. Balancing the actual Lost River Cave tours and setting up for our event, you can tell that the staff there does not mess around. They hosted three weddings that weekend and between events, we felt like we were the only ones they were focused on. It was awesome!   
  
I strongly recommend anyone to book this venue for a wedding, private event, or just to hang out at the Cave. The venue was everything we could have dreamed of and more, and it was incredibly affordable too. Thank you all so much for delivering such an awesome experience :D -Josh & Savannah

The most amazing wedding venue!

I am from Bowling Green, so could never have imagined this location as my wedding venue but I am SO glad I did. All of our guests were so wowed and in awe of cave, it is of course almost as unique as it comes. The space rental includes a beautiful chandalier, draping, and lights in the space so there was very little lift when it came to those types of things. There are a few suggested vendors that really worked out well because they were quality and knew the venue. Leading up the day of Maegan was very communicative, and the day of we saw her and her staff around the property all friendly and willing to help. Really, everyone down to the staff driving our guests on golf carts were friendly and ready to help make sure our day went off without any issues!! Book this venue now!

Amazing Place and Highly Recommend 

Lost River Cave was an amazing menu to get married at and the staff are just as awesome. Maegan was just so easy to work with , very kind, and just made everything easy for us. We are out of state and Maegan was able to accommodate our virtual tour and just answered so many questions for us. Would definitely recommend to others and it really created an unforgettable day and wedding.

The most romantic cave!

We had a fantastic experience using Lost River Cave as our wedding venue. Be prepared to book very far in advance if you want to use this stunning venue. We booked our wedding date last summer and only had 2 dates to choose from this year, but if a venue is great it will fill up quickly. Our contact Maegan, was very helpful and answered any and all questions that we had regarding planning. Due to the inclimate weather we did have to move the ceremony into the cave, where we had only planned to have the reception. That did create up some hiccups, but it all worked out in the end. If I had to do it all over I would pick Lost River Cave again and again.

Highly recommend!

The venue is so effortlessly beautiful you don’t break the bank decorating! The staff were amazing- if it wasn’t for the cave staff the hiccup with our caterer would have turned into a real fiasco. Lost river staff were incredible, we cannot thank them enough. Maegan was a delight during the planning process and was always helpful and responsive when we reached out with questions.
