Annie is a true gem! Right from the start, Annie was warm, kind and thoughtful in guiding us in the process of not only helping to create the perfect ceremony (and day) for us but also navigate all the dreaded paperwork and details. Her deep years of experience, truly getting to know us, and passion for details helped us create something that was 1000% better than what we initially planned ... and create magical memories that we will always remember. She is not only a flawless speaker, but the cadence, warmth and humour immediately put us at easy. I highly recommend Annie ... not only is she the best officiant I've worked with (from planning other weddings) - I feel like she is now a great friend. A heartfelt thank you, Annie!

Reverend Gary wrote a beautiful ceremony for us that perfectly captured the elements we wanted in our marriage. He was able to get to know us through a few phone calls and our answers to his wonderful questionnaire and then incorporated all of us into the ceremony. He guided us through writing our own vows as well which was great to have someone to give feedback on those! He is very professional and we really enjoyed working with him!

We stumbled across Adirondack Ever After as a last-minute effort while planning a spontaneous weekend elopement during our Adirondack getaway. Honestly, with how last minute everything was, I didn’t think we’d be able to find anyone at all—but this team is truly something else. They went above and beyond to coordinate, plan, and execute our adventurous elopement, and made what felt impossible feel completely seamless. The ceremony script was incredibly thoughtful and fully customized to us as a couple. It struck the perfect balance between romantic and humorous—we found ourselves laughing one moment and wiping away tears the next. From start to finish, she made us feel so special and ensured our day was joyful, meaningful, and unforgettable. On top of that, she provided a detailed guide to the town with recommendations so we could book reservations and enjoy fun activities in the days following our ceremony. She even called the restaurant we were dining at, and they surprised us with an incredible meal and dessert we never saw coming. We couldn’t have imagined a more perfect experience and are so grateful for the care, thoughtfulness, and heart that went into making our day truly magical.

We were so happy to have found Corey to help us put together the perfect wedding ceremony. She spent a lot of time to get to know us in the months before the wedding, and listened to all of the spiritual/ non spiritual components we wanted to make up our ceremony. We were not really sure what we were doing, but she helped guide us and give us options that made the process really easy and enjoyable. Ultimately, she created a beautiful ceremony, that perfectly reflected us as a couple. I would highly recommend Corey to give a beautiful, professional ceremony for your wedding!

4.8 out of 5 rating

As a couple who identifies as deeply spiritual but not necessarily religious, Kathryn did an excellent job of helping to craft our custom ceremony into a really meaningful experience that wove in elements of what was important to us both. Kathryn has wonderful energy, and from the moment we connected with her we knew we were in good hands. She took time to get to know us as a couple, offered a premarital session with her which was really helpful, and seamlessly created a ceremony with our requests while adding her own creative flair that brought it all together. I was in tears the first time I read through it. We received such positive feedback from our guests that it was the most genuine ceremony they've seen at a wedding. Couldn't have imagined our ceremony any other way.

Stephen has got to be THE BEST officiant. Not to sound biased but our ceremony was executed perfectly. Stephen provided guidance on building our ceremony and writing our own vows. He followed up several times over the months leading up to our wedding to make sure we were on track and not allowing us to stress at the last minute and not make well thought out decisions. Prior to the ceremony beginning, he explained to the guests the format of the wedding, and instructed them when to stand, sit, and not to use cell phones for photos. So many of our guests told us how much they loved Stephen and how great of a job he did. I would recommend him to anyone getting married.
