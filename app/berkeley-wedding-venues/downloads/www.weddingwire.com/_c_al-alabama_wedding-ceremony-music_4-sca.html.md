Music was gorgeous! This may have been the least stressful of all parts of my planning. Jenn, the bride, was very flexible about the music played during the ceremony, except for what she walked down the aisle to. I told Lisa at Perfect Events(Dolce Duo) to pick the rest of the music, and she did a fantastic job.

Marsha Gunter is the best! Our wedding seemed like a dream with her playing prelude and wedding march songs. We would recommend her any day. She is truly a hidden gem.

What a pleasure to work with the Auburn Quartet. For our ceremony we only needed the Duo but it was absolutely perfect for what we needed for our intimate, evening wedding ceremony.

Karen was fantastic! She is lovely and so easy to work with! She and her cellist played my fav music along with different styles of music that all the guests enjoyed.

Joy was so professional and promptly handled all of our questions. She arrived as scheduled and went straight to work on our daughter’s wedding day taking photos of the area and setting up her easel. During the reception, she was very receptive to guests stopping by and watching or talking with her. We received the final painting approximately four weeks after the wedding once Joy had completed and treated it. The final painting was realistic and beautiful! We were extremely pleased with Joy’s work and recommend her highly!
