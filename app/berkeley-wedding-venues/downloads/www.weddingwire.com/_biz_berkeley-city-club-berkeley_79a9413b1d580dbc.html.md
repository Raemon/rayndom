Wonderful wedding in historic setting

We just celebrated our son's wedding at the Berkeley City Club on September 30, 2023. It is a fantastic venue and we highly recommend it. The building is beautiful, and for weddings, you have the use of several rooms (virtually the entire second floor), including the ballroom, members lounge (library) and foyer. Most guests had not seen the venue and just raved about how fantastic it is. BCC did a really good job in setting up and implementing the wedding, also. When we first booked the venue, there was turnover in their lead staff, but that ended well before the wedding and we were well taken care of prior to the wedding with all the last minute planning, details, etc. that need to be worked out. BCC has a really good restaurant on site, which was helpful as the food was really good. The room looked gorgeous and service of both the food and the bar was fantastic. The grooms brought their own cake and this was nicely served as well. Other perks of getting married there include a free suite for the wedding couple the wedding night and half off the night before, reserved parking for the wedding couple and a photo shoot by the drop-dead gorgeous indoor pool (this is a Julia Morgan designed facility and it is outstanding architecturally). It is also very nice that the BCC is also a hotel. All of the grooms' families and most of the wedding party stayed there, which was not only convenient but fun as we kept running into people the day before, the day of and the day after the wedding. There is also a really good venue (Beta Lounge) two blocks away where there was a really fun after-party. And the guests (mostly from out-of-state) really enjoyed the Berkeley vibe, one block from the UC Berkeley campus and a nice student atmosphere. We have only good things to say about the venue. If you are looking for an historic and gorgeous venue in an urban area (also convenient for transportation purposes) with a great staff and service, we highly recommend the Berkeley City Club!

All great things 

(Review for catering/events/venue service)   
  
I don’t have enough great words for Nicole and her team at Berkeley City Club.  
  
I planned my wedding entirely “remotely” from out of state and Nicole was always ready to answer my millions of questions and make sure everything was being planned to perfection.  
  
I had actually never seen the hotel in person, and I must say the architecture, foliage, vibes, etc are better and MORE stunning in person than in photos. Truly a breathtaking venue that transports you with its historic arches, details, etc.   
  
Wedding food is often lackluster in my experience, but I was thoroughly impressed by all of the plated dinner dishes we were served. My salmon was perfectly cooked and guests complimented their meals as well. They were also able to accommodate all gluten free food as I have celiac disease, which was the cherry on top.   
  
Additionally, a special shout out to the staff who worked the event day-of. Everyone was kind with bright smiles, and treated me and everything/everyone else with care.

Dream wedding at the Berkeley City Club

We were married at the Berkeley City Club in November of 2021, and it was the most magical and lovely wedding anyone could hope for!   
We started looking for venues in January of 2020, and toured one or two before we visited the City Club. We pretty much knew it was our spot from the second we walked through the door. Julia Morgan's "Little Castle" is exactly that; romantic, elegant, intimate yet large enough for a medium-sized wedding like ours. I haven't seen architecture as beautiful anywhere else in the Bay Area, and the price was on the high end of our budget but still affordable.   
Our first point of contact, Heather, was incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and accommodating. She answered all of our questions and was flexible enough to allow us to customize the packages they offered to our meet our needs.   
By July of 2020 it was clear we would not be able to safely hold our wedding on our original date (late November, 2020). Heather and the City Club team were so understanding, supportive, and comforting during a challenging time. They rescheduled our wedding for the same weekend of the following year and helped us feel excited even when things felt pretty bleak.   
By the time we got back in touch in early 2021, there had been some staff transitions, but eventually we were put in touch with Yulianna, who was an absolute rockstar throughout the final days of our wedding planning. We threw a ton of questions at her and she answered them in a kind and timely way. At the rehearsal and the day of, Yulianna was with us every step of the way and went the extra mile to make sure every detail was perfect. The serving staff at our wedding were incredible (especially Maria!), and the whole team made us feel like royalty.   
Overall, the Berkeley City Club made our dream wedding happen and we would recommend it to anyone looking for their fairytale wedding venue!

Everything at the Berkeley City Club is amazing.

Madison was our coordinator leading up the wedding, and was clear and prompt in all of her communications. The venue itself is so classic; we brought in minimal decorations, since the venue itself is so beautiful. Our dinner was fantastic, and the kitchen was extremely accommodating with dietary restrictions.   
  
And the staff is so so so friendly. I can’t stress this enough. During our wedding, we all felt that everyone there was also having a good time along with us. Seeing their happiness and excitement for us really added to the event.

Amazing COVID-19 wedding experience!

My family and I had such a lovely experience with the Berkeley City Club. I decided to go through with a small wedding this August despite all the limitations of Covid-19. The BCC events coordinator, Heather, really pulled out all the stops to make it a special day for us out on their terrace. Delicious food and drinks were served in a safe and thoughtful way. My guests were able to sit outside with the right amount of distance between us but an atmosphere that brought us together. We even got to dance! Thanks to BCC for making it happen.

Amazing Staff, Stunning Location - Doesn't Get Better Than This

I wish I could give this place 10/5 stars for the amazing service, great care, accommodating and kind staff alone... but add to that the stunning building and incredible views... it would break Wedding Wire, I would give them so many stars!  
We got engaged the week everything shut down. After searching for somewhere that offered a refund for Covid aka “acts of God” (I think that’s what most places call that kind of cancellation), my fiancé stumbled across this place and their prices were very reasonable, their refund policy beat the other places, the couches in the members lounge make for easy beautiful photos even WITH distancing (each group at a different chair/couch for artistic clustering), and they were really a joy to work with!  
In addition to Covid complications, we also had to plan for a family member who had very particular special needs and the hotel staff were beyond patient in figuring out everything and pulled it off beautifully!   
The chef is great and the food was very good quality and he was still kind enough to accommodate requests we made on customizing the menu!   
The hotel staff and wait staff are beyond kind and made us feel welcome every step of the way! They even remembered my family and asked about my nephew when we came back from our tasting.   
Heather (their event coordinator) was our main point of contact and she was very transparent, friendly, professional, and patient the whole time. Planning a wedding during a pandemic is a real challenge and can be emotionally draining but this place and the staff here was the saving grace that made the whole experience possible, beautiful, and they even brought joy back into the process.  
On top of ALL THAT, the whole building is gorgeous, photos here are beautiful and the bridal suite we stayed in had these huge, lovely windows that let in a nice sea breeze and overlooked the bay. The night before our wedding, we loved sitting on the couch, choosing our wedding music, and watching the sunset.  
This is such a special place! This really is the best place to work with and have a perfect wedding or, really, any event or even to just stay for vacation! We will definitely be coming back to visit more casually.  
So, I’d give this about 1,000,000,000/5 stars. Hope that doesn’t break Wedding Wire. 😉

The most incredible venue and team

We couldn't be more grateful to the Berkeley City Club team for providing us such a beautiful venue for our ceremony and reception and helping us bring our wedding vision to life! When we first saw the venue, we immediately fell in love. The architecture and classic, romantic atmosphere matched perfectly with our vision. Victoria was incredible to work with and so flexible; ensuring every detail was exactly what we wanted and how we wanted it. The team the day of from catering, to hospitality, executed flawlessly. This venue and the team are the very best and we will be back often to visit and will be reliving our special day over and over for years to come!

Beautiful Venue

We are so grateful to have hosted our wedding at Berkeley City Club last month. Berkeley City Club is an absolute gem of a venue and after searching for some time we found it to be a great deal compared to other Bay Area venues of similar capacities. The venue is special in so many ways, and it is hard to beat the convenience of guest rooms and in-house catering as well. We blocked out most of the hotel for our wedding guests -- and our friends and family loved staying here for the weekend, as did we! The in-house catering made the planning process much easier- and the food ended up being one of the highlights of our wedding!   
  
-We received so many compliments on both the food and the drinks at our wedding! When we discovered that Chef Marcon could provide us an Indian Buffet at our reception dinner- we jumped at the opportunity. We are so glad we did! Our guests could not stop talking about how delicious the food (especially the deserts!) was. BCC will work with you on your menu- which we really appreciated! We had "signature cocktails" - and the bartenders did a wonderful job! We received many compliments about the drinks.   
  
-The events coordinator Victoria Kreckler was wonderful to work with- she is very detail oriented, patient, accommodating and responsive! She worked with us every step of the way to make sure our wedding unfolded the way we imagined. It was clear that she was invested in our wedding and she took wonderful care of us!   
  
-The venue itself is just stunning. We had our ceremony on the terrace with about 170 people, which felt cozy but comfortable. There were so many locations to take photographs throughout the day. I was initially worried about the ballroom feeling to crowded with 18 tables, a dance floor, the bar, buffet, etc. But the room felt well-organized and spacious!   
  
-Every staff member we encountered was incredibly kind. They really went above and beyond and both the wedding and reception went so smoothly.   
  
All in all, we had an incredible experience with Berkeley City Club and are so glad we got married here.

We could not have asked for a better venue for our wedding. This place is a hidden gem and I can’t believe I had not been to a wedding here before my own. We received so many compliments on our choice and working with Ashley Patrick and her team was a pleasure. The best parts about this place that must be seen in person to fully appreciate are the many locations for gorgeous photos and how your guests will be able to be truly together for your entire event. Highly recommend!

I was married here for my ceremony only in the Drawing Room with a guest count of 95 and had the reception at a resturant. All I can say is this venue is great for a wedding in a beautiful building with so much history. The event manager was fantastic from start to finish and very responsive and professional. I had no concerns the day of my wedding as I knew everything was taken care of. The value for this venue in the Bay Area cannot be beat!
