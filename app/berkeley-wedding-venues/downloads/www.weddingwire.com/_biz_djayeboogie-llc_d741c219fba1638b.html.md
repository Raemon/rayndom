I am a Philadelphia native with an extensive resume as it relates to Weddings / Nightlife / Entertainment.

Crowd Pleaser 

We couldn’t have asked for a better DJ Super professional and easy to work with. We had a planning meeting before the wedding to go over our vision, must-play songs, and overall vibe. Outside of the key songs like our intro and first dance, we trusted him to read the room and he absolutely delivered. The transitions, song choices, and timing were all on point. Guests were vibing the entire night. Also very affordable for the quality and experience he brought. Highly recommend if you want someone who’s smooth, prepared, and really gets the crowd going.

Immaculate Vibes

Not only a great DJ but a great entertainer. Kept the crowd involved through out the proceedings, unmatched vibes. From hiphop to r&b, afrobeats to amapiano, from old school to new school, blending music and setting the vibe as only a true DJ and lover of music can.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ DJ Aaron was an absolute standout—twice! Best DJ Ever!

We first booked Aaron for my husband's 30th birthday party, and it was a total hit. I was secretly auditioning him for our wedding, and he exceeded every expectation. His pricing was fair, payment options flexible, and communication smooth from the start.  
When COVID forced us to postpone our September 2020 wedding to August 2021, Aaron didn’t hesitate—he honored our deposit and new date, which brought huge relief during a stressful time. He even came to our home before the wedding to walk through every detail. Professional, thoughtful, and confident—he answered every question and made sure our vision came to life.  
On the big day, he arrived early, was incredibly organized, and kept the energy flowing from start to finish. Aaron’s ability to engage the crowd and read the room was phenomenal. He brought our families together on the dance floor, and created a vibe that everyone—young and old—loved.  
To this day, guests still talk about how amazing our DJ was. As we approach our fourth anniversary, I’d recommend Aaron a thousand times over. God willing, he’ll be there for our 10th year celebration too.

DJ AyeBoogie-The Vibe Comes Included! 

  
DJ AyeBoogies is hands down one of the best DJs I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with! From start to finish, he showed nothing but professionalism, respect, and genuine care for making our event unforgettable. Not only was he charismatic and engaging, but he also kept the energy high and the dance floor full all night long!  
  
He came dressed to impress and instantly gave off a vibe that made everyone feel like we were in for something special. What truly stood out was how he seamlessly went from being a vendor to becoming part of the family. That kind of presence is rare and truly appreciated.  
  
If you’re a bride looking for a DJ who will deliver an unforgettable experience and keep your guests on their feet, DJ AyeBoogies is the one! The vibe comes included — no extra charge. Do yourself a favor and book him for your next event. You won’t regret it!
