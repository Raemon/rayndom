Ellen made my wedding vision come to life in a way that was better than I could have ever expected! She was very responsive to feedback and displayed my florals with beautifully organic creativity. Any time I had a question she was happy to work with me and brainstorm ideas to really curate arrangements that fit with the space and style. I received so many compliments from my guests on the florals that I would absolutely love to work with Ellen again, for any size event!

Seifferts Flower Mill was the definition of an ideal vendor to work with! Rita was so helpful when it came to finding a style that met our budget and vision. She put together gorgeous bouquets and flower arrangements that really pulled everything together.

Jeremy was amazing to work with. With our rescheduling, we had a million changes and he was able to accommodate them all. I know I must have been frustrating, but Jeremy never let it show. My flowers were beautiful and exactly what I wanted. I am so happy to have worked with Lowe's and have recommended them to other friends getting married in the Cleveland area. I cannot say enough good things!

We had such a wonderful experience with our florist! She created the most beautiful bouquets, corsages, boutonnières, and stunning arch arrangements that truly brought our wedding vision to life. Her communication was excellent throughout the entire process. She even sent photos of the arrangements the day before the wedding and happily made any small adjustments we requested. I also loved that she set aside extra flowers for our wedding cake—such a thoughtful touch! We couldn’t have been happier with her work and would highly recommend her to anyone looking for gorgeous floral designs and exceptional service.

We provided Mallory with an inspiration photo and from there, she brought our dream to life. The software she used made it very easy to compare the inspiration photo to the actual items to be used by Petals & Leaves together with the cost. She thought of everything we didn’t, including arranging for the bouquet and boutonniere to be delivered to the location where photos were being taken prior to the ceremony. We couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out! However, be mindful of the deadlines - there is very little flexibility when it comes to ordering flowers.

I used Countryside for my wedding and the flowers were absolutely beautiful! I gave them my vision and they brought it to life! I couldn’t be happier with my flowers. Everyone involved made the process extremely smooth. I 100% recommend using Countryside!!

I’ve always used Bryan’s for my floral needs and knew it was a no brainer for my wedding. They did a fabulous job and I couldn’t be happier how all my pieces turned out. The planning process was easy and very helpful with decision making. The colors were perfect and made our event beautiful. I can’t recommend Bryan’s more to all brides and anyone who needs anything floral.

After my first phone call with Amy, I knew I had to go with Botamer's for my wedding flowers. I felt she truly understood my vision, unlike other florists I had contacted prior. She did not let me down!! Amy was very flexible and patient with the many questions I asked. On the day of my wedding, the flowers were so beautiful and of excellent quality. The color scheme was exactly what I envisioned and helped tie together the whole event. I received many many compliments :) I highly recommend Botamer Florist & More.
