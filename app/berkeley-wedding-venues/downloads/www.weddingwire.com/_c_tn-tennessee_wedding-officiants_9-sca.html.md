The God Squad was fantastic! I would recommend them wholeheartedly to any couple. We do not live here, so we had to correspond via email and phone prior to the ceremony and they were very responsive and had great suggestions. They did a great job incorporating all our wants while still keeping the short ceremony we wanted.

Rev. Jen was very helpful, responsive and very accommodating. Made that day the best day of my life giving the location and circumstances. Highly recommend 10/10. Communication is top tier as well.

We were so blessed to have Pastor Chad Richards in San Diego. Having been a wedding planner for over 10 years, and an opportunity to connect with so many wonderful vendors, he has been our favorite officiant to recommend. Not just for his joyful energy, but for leading the ceremony with an in-depth knowledge of the couple and getting to know what would make them most comfortable during their vows to one another.

We truly could not have asked for a better officiant for our wedding. Todd made the entire process feel easy and stress free. The ceremony was beautiful, personal, and exactly what we hoped for. One of the things we appreciated most was his steady presence. It was so reassuring to know that if anything were to go wrong, he already had it handled. He made us feel completely taken care of, allowing us to be fully present and enjoy every moment. We are so grateful for him and would recommend him without hesitation to any couple.

We truly valued the premarital counseling sessions we completed with Reverend Sandy. Those conversations were insightful and provided us with a wonderful foundation as we prepared for our life together. It was clear that Reverend Sandy genuinely cared about the success of our marriage, not just the success of the wedding day. On the day of the event, her professionalism was unmatched. She was consistently prompt for every meeting, including the rehearsal and the wedding itself. Having someone dependable gave us such peace of mind during a busy weekend. We cannot recommend Reverend Sandy enough,

She was extremely professional. We weren’t to sure what we wanted but we didn’t want anything super over the top. It was about 20 minutes long total and it was perfect. She did and amazing job. The script she came up with was so beautiful and unique. The pricing was very affordable. She was also able to travel all th way to clingmans dome for us. We’re so glad we close this option. We highly recommend her.

I would recommend hiring Wes to anyone that is looking for an officiant. From the start of the process to the end, he was incredibly professional and helpful. He took the time in the interview process to get to know us and learn things about our past. He was punctual, informative and helped keep the nerves calm before and during the ceremony. The way he spoke, you would have thought he'd been a long time family friend. Throughout the reception after the ceremony, I had quite a few people come up to me and mention what an outstanding job he did. Thank you Wes for all you did!

We didn’t know what to expect when looking for a wedding officiant. Rev. Don was amazing, easy to talk to, and delivered much more of a service to us than we expected. The ceremony he wrote for our wedding was very personalized and special because he took the time to know us beforehand. We really appreciate everything he did and are glad he was a part of our day!
