We stayed at the Belizean Shores and worked with Esmy to arrange a dinner for 8 on their dock for my husbands 60th birthday . It was a wonderful evening with Mitch and Wayne as our servers. They did an out standing job. Esmy was outstanding as well. I worked with her to arrange everything and it all came out beautiful. It was a beautiful evening. Thank you so much!

We are a young family with children aged 3 and 1 from Canada. We decided to get married in San Pedro, Belize and had no idea where to start with planning. Luckily we were able to find Lara at Romantic Travel Belize to help us in our journey of planning our wedding. Right from the start Lara was incredible. She was excellent at communicating with us and completely understood our vision for our wedding. She took care of everything from scouting out locations, accommodations for our wedding night and assistance in ideas for the rest of our trip. Whenever we had questions and concerns, she was always available to answer them; even giving us details we would never have thought of as she knows the island inside and out. She was able to find us an amazing photographer in Galy Vasquez. She took care of all of the details so that there was no stress for us at all. Every aspect of the wedding was exactly as we had pictured it and all we had to do was show up! Her team raked the beach to remove the seaweed multiple times, set up and removed all of the decor. During our ceremony she had a knack for keeping our wedding intimate even though people were gathering to watch. She was able to keep people at a distance so that they didn’t interfere with the wedding. After our wedding she arranged for us to have drinks and snacks at Palapa Bar where she made sure the owners greeted us and took care of us. She recommended and arranged for a private chef to cook us an incredible wedding dinner at our villa; which was a perfect idea considering our young children. It was incredible how she took our vision and built on it. We would highly recommend Lara at Romantic Travel Belize for any event in San Pedro (Ambergris Caye). She is a wealth of knowledge and a true professional. Thank you Lara and Romantic Travel Belize for making our wedding and stay in San Pedro so special.

I can’t say enough good things about my wedding experience at Secrets Tulum. From start to finish, it was absolutely beautiful, and honestly, I’m still in awe of how everything turned out. I was a little anxious leading up to the day because I had a pretty awful experience with my first wedding planner. But then I met Rachael, and she completely turned everything around. Rachael is truly amazing—she was calm, collected, and so on top of every little detail. She made sure everything was in place and that I was feeling relaxed and confident every step of the way. She even made time to check in with us to ensure we were okay. Her professionalism and warmth made the entire process so much smoother, and honestly, I can’t imagine how we would’ve managed without her. She has an incredible team that really supports her, and I could see how much effort they all put into making our day perfect. We had a small wedding at the garden at Secrets Tulum, which has always been my dream location. The moment I stepped into the garden, it felt like something straight out of my vision board—absolutely enchanting. To have a wedding in that secret garden, surrounded by lush greenery and the sound of the ocean, was nothing short of magical. It’s exactly what I had always envisioned for my wedding day. Rachael made sure to make everything personal to us, and she even started with a free consultation, which helped us feel at ease. As someone from Ontario, planning a destination wedding could have been overwhelming, but Rachael made it so simple and stress-free. She was always responsive, offering helpful tips and suggestions, and was there for every question we had, big or small. I honestly can’t thank Rachael enough for everything she did. She truly saved our special day and made it everything I had hoped for and more. I’ve recommended her to everyone I know who’s planning a wedding, and I’ll keep singing her praises for years to come. If you’re thinking about getting married in Tulum, or really anywhere, Rachael is the one you need by your side. Thank you so much, Rachael! You’ll always hold a special place in my heart for making my dream wedding come true.

We absolutely loved working with Dulce Belize Weddings. Honestly, they were worth every penny. Planning a wedding in Belize while we were living in the U.S. could have been super stressful, but they made the entire process feel so smooth and easy. They were always super responsive, really organized, and handled so many details that we never even had to think about. From the start, they were on top of everything: coordinating with our venue at Mahogany Bay Resort and Village so well that it made logistics for us and all our guests a breeze. Their attention to detail was amazing. Every vendor they brought in, from the florals to makeup to seating was professional, punctual, and top quality. On the wedding day, we didn’t have to worry about a thing. Seriously. We just showed up and enjoyed. There was even a last-minute weather change that forced Dulce Belize to rework the entire layout and flow of the event, and none of our guests had any idea. That’s how seamless they made it. Mariel was our main coordinator, and she had everything running like a well-oiled machine. Melody was also incredible—she put so much care and thought into the floral arrangements and design. The whole team was so kind and attentive, especially to our elderly family members, making sure they were comfortable and looked after while the rest of us partied. So many of our guests told us it was one of the most fun and beautiful weddings they’d ever been to and we really believe that’s largely thanks to Dulce Belize Weddings. Every idea we had, they not only made happen but made better. 10/10 would recommend.

Jaime with Confetti Grand thought of all the details to make sure our special day was perfect. He asked all the right questions to make sure we had everything we needed, was supportive, his prices were very reasonable, and he never pushed anything on us that we didn’t want. The flowers, tableware, lighting and decor were so classy and beautiful. The food and cake was delicious, the dj’s were so fun and the photographers were amazing to work with. Thank you Confetti Grand for making our beach wedding a dream come true!
