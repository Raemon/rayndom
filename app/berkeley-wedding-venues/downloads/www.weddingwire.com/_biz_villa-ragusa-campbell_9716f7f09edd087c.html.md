Dream Wedding 

I had my Wedding Ceremony and Reception at Villa Ragusa in September 2023 and it was so beautiful and funny. My guest really loved the venue, food and bar. we have 360 guests and had plenty of space for ceremony, reception, dancing and dinner buffet. Villa Ragusa's staff took great care of us!

Beautiful space and delicious food! 

I booked a corporate event at Villa Ragusa and Laura knocked it out of the park. We were not the easiestttt of clients, but she took all our curve balls and helped us throughout the whole way. She was so flexible and adapted to everything. I felt like I had a million questions, but she was always there to answer any of them and give any advice I needed in order to make this a successful event! The catering staff and bartenders were all so nice and were so attentive. Thank you again to Villa Ragusa, Laura and their team! Hope we can book future events there!

Location Location Location!

*I apologize in advance this review is a few years late* We absolutely loved getting married at Villa Ragusa! It has been a few years now, but we had a day of coordinator named Hillary who was FANTASTIC. Getting married in February we knew an indoor venue was a must. The entry way is stunning (I had pre-wedding dreams about photos on the entry staircase!), the location is the best, and it was priced so well. We knew from the start we would have a large guest list, so trying to find a reasonably priced venue and food/alcohol etc. that didn't require a ton of heavy lifting from us and piecing vendors together was HARD. The alcohol prices were seriously... unbelievable, and believe me for our group of friends this was important. All in all we were so happy we decided to go with a large local venue with the sweetest staff and great food/drinks! Thanks all!

We had our Reception at Villa Ragusa in July. VR is a massive and beautiful banquet hall that fits up to 600 people and was our top choice when choosing Reception venues. VR is very reasonably priced with one of the best alcohol packages!!   
  
We had the pleasure to work with Hilary throughout our planning process. We cannot express in words how amazing Hilary is. From day one, she was truly involved, answered every single one of our hundreds of questions (even if we re-asked the same questions), and made sure that our special day would turn out truly special. She was very easy to work with, always available, very responsive, and very accommodating when scheduling appointments to go see the venue. She helped us with everything from the small details to the big stuff. She put together a floor plan that best fit our needs/wants and even provided genuine advice from her years of organizing events. Laura another great coordinator was the one present on the day of our reception and she made sure everything ran by smoothly.   
  
Other bonuses: VR has a kitchen that is perfect for food vendors to use, they build a dance floor to fit your size needs, have a wide selection for table cloth and chair sashes to choose from and to top it of there is also ample of free/safe parking in the area making it convenient for guests.   
  
Overall, we're very happy with choosing Villa Ragusa as our Reception venue. We would definitely recommend this venue to anyone.

Hilary and Laura were responsive, professional and helpful. If I wrote them an email, I would get a response in an hour or sooner. It was probably sooner but lets say an hour to be safe. The venue was flexible about with the vendors we wanted to use as well as the number of vendors . They were always forthcoming with all the options for the venue, like the bar limits, or when the vendors could start setting up, or the number of events that would also be taking place on the day of my event. All you had to do was ask and they would answer any question you had.

Villa Ragusa is an absolutely beautiful venue. Furthermore, its located in a nice downtown area (downtown Campbell). The staff is professional and accommodating and they offer very impressive all inclusive wedding packages. So happy I picked them for my wedding venue.

Hilary and her team will make the wedding planning experience easy. They are always professional and prompt in all responses and accommodating for special circumstances. They guide you along the way and are as hands on as you want them to be giving you the customer the ability to create your perfect day.

Just celebrate our wedding banquet at Villa Ragusa.  
What a memorable time it was. The place was well-lit (pictures online don't represent that well enough). Food was amazing! - They provided catering with the package we selected instead of outside catering. Guests of family and friends gave high praise to the decor.   
  
We are very thankful and fortunate to have selected not just Villa the place, but the coordinator. Hilary was our main point of contact and an amazing coordinator. She definitely provided ease and relief among the stress. Clearly our easiest vendor that we worked with.

After searching reception sites high and low that would accommodate 250 people we came across Villa Ragusa. We met with Marisa and instantly hit it off. Their prices were very reasonable compared to other sites. We went with the priceless package and felt that it was the best value. It included things such as votives and candles, cake, appetizers, and chair covers. We also liked that they had a flat fee for their bar packages instead of a per drink price as all of the hotels do. The site was definitely more modern than some of the others we visited and the staff was very helpful.   
  
We did run into one issue at our tasting with the food that was served. They were very attentive and quickly re-schedule a new tasting. They assured us that all the concerns would be corrected, and they were. We received many compliments on the food. Marisa made sure the night flowed smoothly and that everyone had a great time. We recommend Villa Ragusa to anyone looking for a reception facility.
