We will forever be grateful to Reverend Cian and the service he provides. He demonstrated professionalism and flexibility from the initial contact to the follow-up email. The peace of mind he offers is worth every dollar. Rev. Cian is wonderful to work with. Additionally, his partner A.J. the photographer was amazing. We couldn't be happier with their services and the memories they helped to create and document. We highly recommend Celtic Ministries! God bless you both!

We traveled to Alaska for our elopement in September 2025, and choosing Laura as our officiant was the best decision we made! She is incredibly kind and professional. From the very beginning, Laura put so much effort into preparing our ceremony script, making sure everything felt personal to us. We even met up the day before to check out the venue, which put our minds at ease. The riverside location she has is absolutely breathtaking—perfect for an intimate ceremony. On the big day, everything went smoothly. Laura handled everything professionally and even helped us find a witness. If you are looking for a stress-free, beautiful, and memorable wedding experience in Alaska, I cannot recommend Say Yes Alaska enough!

We chose to elope at Creamer’s Field, and it was honestly the perfect decision. We wanted something simple, private, and beautiful — and that’s exactly what Golden Heart Weddings Alaska gave us. Our ceremony took place inside the viewing shelter, overlooking the snowy migratory waterfowl area. It had snowed the night before, so the whole landscape looked like a winter postcard. And we were lucky — it was just before the cold snap hit, so the weather was crisp but comfortable for our little group. It was just us, Jathen’s brother Malik, my best friend Mei, and our sweet baby girl Aaliyah. Even with such a small group, everything felt so special and heartfelt. Minister Elise was incredibly warm and made the ceremony feel personal — not rushed, not generic — truly ours. Why we’re so glad we hired Golden Heart Weddings Alaska: I was stress free and easy. Not a big production., GHW to took care of everything we needed, from mailing the license, after the ceremony, to helping us choose the ceremony spot. It let us just show up and focus on each other. Minister Elise made us feel celebrated.. Even though it was an just a small elopement, she made it feel like the most important wedding in Alaska that day. We never felt like “just another couple.” Getting married with a toddler present is not easy. We felt likenap times, snacks, and diaper breaks was no big deal… and they did it with patience and smiles. If you’re considering eloping in Alaska — especially if you want a day that feels intimate, peaceful, and full of meaning — we can’t recommend Golden Heart Weddings enough. The ceremony was short, sweet, and absolutely perfect. We’ll treasure this memory forever.

If you’re dreaming of an unforgettable, one-of-a-kind wedding in Juneau, AK stop searching and reach out to Linda at I Do Alaska Weddings, www.idoalaskaweddings.com! My now-husband and I wanted a small, surprise ceremony with our family during our cruise stop in Juneau, and Linda helped make our adventure absolutely perfect. We connected with Linda over the phone and she helped us plan a nonreligious glacier ceremony on Mendenhall Glacier that included us and eight of our closest family members. Booking from across the country can be nerve-wracking, but the small 5% deposit gave us peace of mind, and Linda delivered on everything. She coordinated two helicopters within our tight port schedule, helped customize a beautiful, personalized ceremony that truly reflected us as a couple, handmade a bouquet and boutonniere for us, and even brought champagne for a toast on the glacier! She picked us up directly from the cruise terminal and personally drove us to the helipad — making everything seamless. After the ceremony, while we celebrated in downtown Juneau with king crab and duck fart shots (a local tradition!), Linda did the heavy lifting of filing our paperwork at city hall so everything could become legal/official. This was the most adventurous, meaningful day of our lives, and it was made possible because of Linda. We cannot recommend her enough. If you’re getting married in Juneau, aren't wanting to break the bank on a wedding, and want to create a memory that is truly special and as unique as your relationship with your partner may be — she is the one to make it happen!
