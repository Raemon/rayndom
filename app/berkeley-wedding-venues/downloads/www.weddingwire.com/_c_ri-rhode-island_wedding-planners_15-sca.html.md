Our wedding would not have been the same without Bunmi. She brought calm, clarity, and confidence during every stage of planning. Whenever I felt stressed or unsure, she had a solution and reassurance ready. On our wedding day, I was able to be fully present and enjoy every moment because I trusted her completely. She went above and beyond, and I’ll always be thankful for the care and heart she put into our special day.

Sam and the Third House team was the absolute BEST. My wedding was a quick turnaround and so I hired her on short notice with some big dreams - and she found a way to make most of them happen, and took the time to gently explain and help redirect me on the things that wouldn't be achievable in the time frame we had. She helped with everything from decor to vendor management and her approach is so deeply rooted in hospitality, so I felt fully held the entire time. I literally don't think I could have gotten through my wedding without her. I would 100% recommend her to anyone looking for a hands-on, deeply personal approach to the most important day of your life.

We couldn’t have asked for a better day-of coordinator than Bridal Bliss. From start to finish, Jenna was absolutely exceptional. She was incredibly detail-oriented and attentive in a way that made us feel completely supported and stress-free. She kept the entire day moving flawlessly, making sure we stayed on schedule without ever feeling rushed. She brought our vision to life with such care and precision, every detail looked exactly how we imagined, and in many cases, even better. Jenna made sure every vendor and team member knew exactly what needed to be done, and she set the entire day up for success with her calmness and thoughtful preparation!! Thanks to her, everything ran smoothly, beautifully, and effortlessly. We truly couldn’t imagine our wedding day without her. Jenna is an absolute gem, and we’re endlessly grateful for everything she did to make our day perfect. We would recommend Jenna and her team for all wedding needs!!!!

We cannot say enough amazing things about Mallory! From the moment we met her, we knew we were in the best hands. She is truly one of the sweetest, most helpful, and organized people we’ve ever met. We hired her as our day-of coordinator, but she went above and beyond in every possible way. One month before the wedding, she took over all communication with our vendors, which was a huge weight off our shoulders. She made sure every single detail was accounted for and ran perfectly—and it did! Mallory was also incredibly helpful with vendor recommendations, timeline planning, and (maybe most importantly) calming us down through the entire process. Her presence is grounding, reassuring, and exactly what every couple needs leading up to and on their wedding day. We also have to shout out her two assistants—wow! Not only were they professional and on top of everything, they were SO much fun to have around. They brought such great energy to the day and made everything feel seamless and joyful. Mallory and her team made our day absolutely perfect. If you’re even considering working with her—do it. You won’t regret it for a second.

Adrianna was an absolutely incredible day-of coordinator, and I truly cannot imagine my wedding day without her. She helped my day run seamlessly from start to finish—setting up decorations beautifully, keeping everyone on schedule, coordinating with staff, and even helping transport items I needed throughout the day. She constantly checked in on me, always making sure I had a drink in my hand and plenty of food, which allowed me to actually relax and enjoy my wedding. Her work ethic, care, and genuine kindness made my day so much less stressful. She treated my wedding as if it were just as important as if I were her own family. When I first saw the decorations she set up, I cried—they were done so perfectly and with so much attention to detail. My wedding day went better than I could have ever imagined, and that is absolutely because of Adrianna’s expertise, dedication, and heart. I cannot recommend her highly enough.

I absolutely loved working with Jaime and had an amazing experience! We ended up with the best team of vendors thanks to her recommendations and superior local knowledge. She just made everything easier, which is exactly what any wedding planner should do - anytime I came to her with questions or general bridal stress, she immediately quelled any anxieties I had and was completely on top of it. Everything went seamlessly thanks to her!

I can't say enough great things about Nadia and her team at IPWE! From start to finish, they went above and beyond to make our wedding day everything we dreamed of. Nadia’s attention to detail was extraordinary. She took the time to get to know us as a couple and really understood our vision for the day. Every idea, from the smallest decor element to the biggest logistical plans, was handled with care and precision. It was clear that she and her team were passionate about making our special day perfect, and it showed in every aspect of the event.

We worked with Kristy and could not have been more happy that we did! She was absolutely amazing to work with - was so responsive, organized, and helpful. She was also so easy and fun to talk to and plan with! From preparation, timeline, vendor coordination, and the final details meeting to the day of from start to finish, Kristy truly went above and beyond. She gave me ideas, thought of little details that I never would have, and truly just listened to my goals/desires for the night to make my dream come to life. She also absolutely crushed the set up and breakdown of our decorations which was a large task. I couldn’t get over how beautiful everything turned out. She took so much weight off my shoulders with just her presence alone and knowing that I had her by my side when needed. I feel so lucky to have had her because my wedding day couldn’t have gone more smoothly! And not only that, but I felt so at ease which was a dream and largely thanks to her. If you are even considering hiring a planner, look no further! 10/10 recommend, she’s amazing!!!

Sarah was the reason why our daughter’s wedding (which was a destination wedding) went off without a hitch. I felt guilty not helping as much with the planning! Let me tell you how amazing a job she did. Every detail was taken care off. Flawless execution!
