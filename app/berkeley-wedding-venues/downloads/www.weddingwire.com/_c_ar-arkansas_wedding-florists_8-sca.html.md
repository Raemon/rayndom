Choosing Tipton & Hurst as the florist for my wedding was easily one of the BEST choices that I made!!! Christina and Mr. Chris were an absolute dream to work with - they're both incredibly talented, organized, and knowledgeable. They really made the process easy and fun! I was absolutely in awe of how beautiful all of the florals were - so were my guests!!! If you're looking for a florist in the Central Arkansas area, look no further - Tipton & Hurst is THE one.

Very detailed. Very attentive. Super flexible and easy to work with! I showed them a picture and they delivered. Not only with a real bouquet, but with a fake one that looked identical for bridal pics we took earlier in the month! They did the corsages and all bouquets for the wedding party as well!

Scott is amazing! I gave him a photo of what I wanted for my bouquet and asked him to do what he thought was best with my bridesmaid bouquets and the boys boutonnières and I was not disappointed! Everything looked fantastic and I couldn't have been happier. :) Me and my family always and will continue to use Scott's anytime we need flowers.

Joe at Cathy's is incredible and I wouldn't want anyone else in Russellville to do any flowers or anything for me except for him. TOTALLY WORTH EVERY PENNY!

Cheryl and Kirby were so wonderful and helpful throughout our wedding planning! They are professional, personable, reasonably priced and a have been a joy to work with. I highly recommend them to anyone looking to have beautiful flowers for a reasonable price.

The bouquets were beautiful and exactly what I wanted. The pricing is great compared to other places especially for the quality. We originally weren’t going to do boutonnières and last minute my groom decided they wanted them. We called ONE day before the wedding to ask for 4 of them and they made it happen and were so kind even with the last minute add in.
