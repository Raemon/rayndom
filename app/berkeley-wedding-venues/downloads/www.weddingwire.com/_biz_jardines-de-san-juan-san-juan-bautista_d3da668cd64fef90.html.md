Perfect venue 

Jardines garden was the perfect setting for our wedding. The lush green trees and flowers gave our day the perfect backdrop. Bly and her team went above and beyond in helping us plan.   
We were able to customize our day and get what we wanted for a fair price.   
I would recommend Jardines for any event you might want to host.

Wedding 10/13/24

I am so glad my husband and I got married at Jardines! It just so happened there was a wedding expo the day we decided to look at venues and we fell in love. Bly was also amazing throughout the whole process. She was a blast to work with and sad I won’t be seeing her anymore! She made our vision come to life with our decorations. I allowed for her to take creative freedom and she did not disappoint. This venue is so beautiful on its own already. You can’t go wrong with this venue. Many of our guests shared it’s the most beautiful wedding they’ve ever attended. Still floating on cloud 9 thinking about how amazing the day was. Thank you Jardines!!

The best wedding experience we could have ever asked for!

We had our wedding here in August 2022 with about 160 guests. Jardines de San Juan is an absolute hidden GEM! From start to finish, Bly made the entire process fun and seamless! She gave us great advice/recommendations throughout and all of the recommended vendors the venue works with are top notch. Incredibly professional and we were able to relax knowing everything was covered. We can't rave enough about how gorgeous the venue is and how great Bly and her team were! THANK YOU!!

Stunning Setting

Having our wedding at Jardines de San Juan was the best decision ever! When my now wife and I went to tour the venue for the first time with Bly we knew that it was a definite yes! I love Spanish style architecture and cacti while Brittany loves roses and flowers. It was amazing to find a place that encompasses all of the things that we love. Another huge factor was the fact that we got to say 'I Do’ with Mexican food which is our absolute favorite thing. Our guests loved the food and thought the venue was stunning. Working with Bly was wonderful as she is extremely knowledgeable in the wedding industry and had so many helpful recommendations to share. We met with her several times to discuss and fine tune the details of our special day. On more than one occasion we would come to her with several pages of questions about various things and she would have answers to all of them! Her team was also really detailed and provided exceptional service. If you are looking for a venue for your wedding we cannot recommend Jardines de San Juan highly enough! For one fee you get the venue, coordination, DJ and catering! Reasonable prices, incredible food, phenomenal service are what you will get if you have your wedding here. You will not be sorry!

Best day ever thanks to Team Jardines

My husband and I had a great experience working with Bly and the Jardines team. We had a July wedding and the venue was gorgeous! Our guests all told us they loved the food and continued to comment on how beautiful the space was. Bly was organized and did a great job keeping things moving according to plan on the wedding day. I did not have to worry about anything on my wedding day which was a huge relief. I highly recommend Jardines for your wedding!!

My Dream Wedding

Our wedding was on 9/15/19. Sorry this is so late!   
From start to finish we enjoyed working with Bly & team. They were so flexible and worked with all of our desires and preferences for our wedding. It was very helpful that Bly has everything under control and was an expert in planning our event and executing it with her team. We had the continental menu for food and it was excellent, even our guests were talking about how good it was for weeks after our wedding.   
One of the things we appreciated most was how much Bly and her team did for us. They fully set everything up and did all the teardown, and everything in between. We had no worries except to enjoy our day. Bly was super chill but had everything under control and was well organized. Our wedding day went fantastic, and we owe a large portion of that to the venue and the team that helped. If we can go back in time we would not change a thing! Thank you so much Bly and Jardines de San Juan

PERFECT is all the words I have left

We hosted our wedding here October 26th this year and all I can say is that the day was perfect!!!! Bly and her team killed it 100%!!!!! The attention to details, the amount of love that goes into making sure our day went perfect was...I have no words!! The staff was very professional, the food was delicious, and our guests said "they've never been to a wedding like this, it was beautiful" the jardin does seem to have the dinner area and dancing area a bit separate but our guests LOVED the fact that they could come and chill away from the dancing and get back to it when they wanted to. We loved our perfect day thanks to this amazing team! We love you guys & I hope that we will see you guys again (I have three sisters still ;) )

Highly recommend for any event

My wedding was this past weekend. Everything was set up perfectly! It was exactly how i imagined it to be. I didn’t feel stressed the entire day! Bly and her team as well as Leo the DJ really know what they are doing! It was executed perfectly! I wish I could relive the day because it was just perfect!
