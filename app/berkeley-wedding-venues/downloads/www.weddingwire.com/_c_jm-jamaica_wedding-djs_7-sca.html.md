876 Sounds made our party as memorable and fun as someone could possibly ask for!! They made sure to play each and every song we requested and even every type of music we asked as there were definitely a few different genres!! They even played each one at the most opportune times!! The videos they collected through our night were just icing on the cake, as they were sooo fun to watch and relive our night and of course, share with our loved ones! This company definitely knows entertainment and will keep your guests engaged the whole time (only if you like to have fun that is) hahaha. 100000% recommend!

We had the absolute pleasure of working with Inspired Events Ja for our wedding, and they exceeded every expectation. From the very first meeting, their professionalism and attention to detail were unmatched. The decor was breathtaking! Every detail, from the centerpieces to the lighting, was thoughtfully designed and executed to perfection. It truly brought our vision to life and created an atmosphere that our guests are still raving about. The DJ was phenomenal! They kept the energy high all night long and seamlessly catered to our crowd’s taste. Every song choice had people on the dance floor, and the transitions were flawless. Communication throughout the process was excellent, and they made planning stress-free and enjoyable. I highly recommend [Planner’s Name/Company] to anyone looking for a wedding or event planner who goes above and beyond to deliver an unforgettable experience. Thank you for making our special day absolutely perfect!

We used DJ Watson and he was great! He was able to have a prior meeting with us and went over all the songs we wanted played. He even came to rehearsal and I really appreciated that. We did start late on the wedding day so during the reception he was just about to really give us a party but the venue stopped us at 10pm. Overall I will use him again!

From the 'get go' everything seemed to flow like 'water running down a hill'. Elvis listened to what we had to say and then gave value added suggestions without being forceful. On the day our wedding, the team was 'ridiculously' professional in the delivery of their services, yet warm and welcoming...... I am particularly impressed with decor of the sound system, which blended seamlessly with our wedding decor!!! We are eternally grateful that Elvis and his team went above and beyond the call of duty to make our weeding a memorable one....dem tun up di dancing segment!!!!!! The only disappointment is that it all ended too soon........AUDIOSTOP TO THE WORL'!!!
