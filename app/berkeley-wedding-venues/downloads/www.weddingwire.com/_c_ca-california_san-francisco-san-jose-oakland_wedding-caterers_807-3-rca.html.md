The average wedding catering cost in the U.S. is about $4,000 with most couples spending between $1,800 to $7,000.

What is included in a wedding catering package?

__

Your [wedding catering](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/planning-a-reception-menu) may be provided by your wedding venue, or you may want or need to hire an outside caterer. Reading a wedding catering contract can be a bit confusing, but in general, your wedding catering cost will be priced on a “per person” basis. A standard wedding catering package includes the following:

  * Food: The wedding food cost is the most obvious part of a wedding catering package. You’re paying for the actual food that your guests will eat during cocktail hour and the main meal. Whether it’s served plated or buffet style is up to you and your caterer.
  * Beverages: Your caterer will likely provide beverages, both alcoholic and not, for your big day.
  * Staffing: From your event manager to cooks, servers, bartenders, and more, there are lots of staffers that will go into making your wedding day a success. It’s important to work with your caterer to make sure that you have enough people on hand to ensure a smooth reception.
  * Rentals: Your caterer may also provide rentals, from tables to chairs, dishes to glassware, utensils, and more. Some venues provide these rentals, or you may need to hire a [separate rentals company](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-event-rentals).
  * Additional fees: Caterers may charge additional costs and fees, including cake cutting fees, corkage fees, and more. Be sure to read your contract carefully—and ask questions—to make sure you understand your wedding catering cost.



What are the different ways to serve wedding reception food?

__

When determining your wedding food cost, a big factor will be how you’re planning on serving the meal. There are a few [serving style options](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-catering-serving-styles-a-glossary) for weddings:

  * Plated: Otherwise known as a sit-down meal, your guests will be served their meal at their table by a member of the wait staff. There may be a single entrée option served or several entrée options, which your guests can either order in advance (usually on their RSVP card) or at the event. This is the most formal and traditional of wedding serving styles.
  * Buffet: For a more casual serving style, guests serve themselves from a buffet station. Fifty percent of couples choose a buffet-style reception.
  * Family-Style: Servers provide large platters of food to reception tables, and guests pass the trays around and serve themselves.
  * Cocktail-Style: A more modern service style, food is served via passed hors d’oeuvres and at stations. This allows guests to walk around, and mix and mingle during the reception instead of sitting at their tables.



What is the average wedding catering cost per person?

__

The average wedding catering cost per person varies depending on your wedding’s service style. For a plated meal, the average cost of wedding catering in the U.S. is $40 per person. For a buffet, the average is $27 per person. 

Is a wedding reception buffet always the cheaper option?

__

Most of the time, a wedding reception buffet is indeed less expensive than a plated dinner. While you’ll pay less in staffing and rentals for a buffet-style meal, you’ll need more food since guests are serving themselves. To keep your buffet budget-friendly, avoid serving costly foods (shrimp, for example) buffet-style or have a staffer on hand to serve your guests from the buffet to keep the portions under control. 

What is the average cost of alcohol for a wedding?

__

Alcohol can comprise a major part of your total wedding catering cost. In general, the average starting price in the U.S. for bar service at a wedding is $15 per person.

We couldn't have asked for a better experience working with Chef John and Diana for our wedding. From start to finish, they were incredibly easy to work with and really took the time to listen to our story, creating a tailored menu that beautifully reflected our different backgrounds. Their creativity shone through in every dish, and their entire team went above and beyond to make our day special. We heard endless comments about how great the meal was from all our guests. We're so grateful for all they did and how it all turned out.

I went into my search for wedding catering thinking that no one remembers the food but I would like for the food served to taste somewhat good but I also didn't want to break the bank with the catering cost. My husband works in hospitality and absolutely despises bland mass produced banquet food. So with all these factors working against us, I somehow managed to find the BEST catering company in the Bay Area! The other great reviews didn't steer me wrong, Caterman fit my budget, I was able to make additional adjustments and communication with Carmen was great. The most surprising thing happened - everyone remembered and LOVED the food. There are definitely going to be some photos of me stuffing my face at our sweetheart table. Most people told me I would forget to eat but I certainly made it a point to eat the food being served. Catering was thoughtful enough to bring me some appetizers during the cocktail hour right before photos were taken. They brought us our food first and then allowed our guests to line up at the buffet. I can't recommend and praise Caterman enough for a job well done. I wouldn't hesitate to book them for future events.

Kitchenina was exceptional from start to finish and is an easy recommendation for anyone planning an event. The food was a major highlight of our wedding. Multiple guests went out of their way to rave about the tri tip and the chicken, and the Greek salad was one of the best I’ve had. Portions were generous, flavors were excellent, and everything was served hot and on time. Aliki and her team were professional, organized, and very easy to work with throughout the planning process. Communication was clear, timelines were handled smoothly, and execution on the day of the wedding was seamless. They were calm, efficient, and clearly experienced with large events. We chose Kitchenina for our wedding and would absolutely book them again for future events. If you want high-quality food, reliable service, and a team you can trust on an important day, Kitchenina is a great choice

James Standfield did a phenomenal job for our wedding at the Fort Mason General's Residence. We got tons of compliments on the food and everything from the staff to the rentals to the set-up was fantastic. We rented our ceremony chairs, reception chairs, linens, table settings, barware, etc. all through james standfield and they made it so easy for us.

We knew we wanted Trattoria da Vittorio to cater our wedding when we had an impromptu dinner at his restaurant in West Portal. I contacted Vittorio to inquire about his catering services and availability, and he responded in less than 24 hours. We set up a private tasting, where he created a beautiful spread of his catering favorites. We still talk about the tasting. We were delighted that his price included most of the rentals, staff, and bartenders. During the planning process, Vittorio was so responsible and flexible. He was always available via text. The day of our wedding couldn't have gone better, his staff was so kind, the passed hors d'oeuvres were flowing, the buffet ran smoothly, and the best part was that we got SO many compliments from our guests about how excellent the food was. Vittorio is easy to work with and knows how to put on a classy and cost-effective affair. We are so happy Vittorio was our caterer on our special day, and the best part is we get to go back to his restaurant and relive a little piece of our wedding.

We were so pleased with our decision to hire Far Out for our wedding. They were flexible and easy to work with, and the food was delicious - we had a number of guests tell us at the wedding how amazing everything was. Having them also staff the bar was a great decision, as they were able to move personnel around throughout the event as needed. The wedding was a backyard wedding, which was more complex for them, but they did an excellent job preparing and executing everything we needed. Carla was great to work with leading up to the event. She was always available, on top of the details, and was a pleasure to work with. We would highly recommend Carla and team to anyone looking for a delicious and professional catering company.

Please hire Gadani for your wedding if you're looking for a unique and delicious dessert option for your guests besides cake!! My (now) husband and I worked with Gadani as our dessert vendor for our wedding in July at Palm Event Center in Pleasanton. We found Gadani from a Facebook recommendation, and Maegan was quick to reply to my inquiry with prices and options. I was able to customize the package to fit my wedding needs better as well, which was great! Pricing was also fair and affordable imo when compared to other dessert vendors for weddings. Maegan invited my fiance and I over to their shop for a complimentary tasting as well so we could decide if using their services would be something we wanted. We were able to try out all the different ice cream and waffle flavors, which were fantastic! The waffle was nice and chewy, and the ice cream flavors were rich/flavorful. Our guests absolutely loved the dessert and they were beyond excited we had this option for our summer wedding! We were able to have 4 ice cream flavors, 2 waffle flavors, and 4 different toppings for guests to choose from. Guests could also opt out of the waffle if they just wanted ice cream. Maegan, Lena, and the rest of the Gadani team were so kind, sweet, and professional during our wedding. My partner and I are SO GLAD we went with Gadani as our dessert vendor. The girls were so sweet and such a joy to work with!! They even gave us a little wedding gift at the end of the night, which was honestly so thoughtful!! (Sorry I don't have any photos to post from my wedding yet, but we enjoyed working with you guys so much!!) We'll be back to Gadani to visit and eat some more delicious bubble waffle ice cream again! :)

Salt & Honey have been incredibly helpful, communicative and punctual throughout our wedding planning process! Olivia and Bella accompanied me and my fiancee on our wedding venue tour, and were both very thoughtful and detail-oriented when asking the property manager questions about our wedding. Salt & Honey have taken almost all of the stress out of planning our special day, and I couldn't be happier with their help!
