Peter and his crew were AMAZING. We hired for day-of coordination and could not imagine having made a better decision. Peter was kind, responsive, and very on top of all the small details. I was a little nervous when we decided to only get day-of assistance, because I feared there would be limited communication or lack of cohesion. My worries were definitely not warranted! The day was magnificent and Peter and his crew ensured everything ran smoothly. He went through every detail of the day in our initial meeting, and even came to our rehearsal! I cannot recommend Peter enough, he is THE BEST.

Choosing Amanda as our wedding planner was easily the best decision we made throughout the entire wedding planning experience!! We ended up going with her full-service offering, as I knew I would want the extra help. Even so, I never could have imagined how much time and effort goes into planning a wedding. Looking back, I don't know how we would have done it without Amanda and her team! She was so involved from the start - providing us with vendor recommendations/pricing, creating a detailed design board, sharing timelines/resources to keep us on track each month, and overall reducing the stress of wedding planning. My husband and I were able to stay present and enjoy every second of our wedding day because I knew Amanda and her team had things covered. Amanda is so hands-on, organized, communicative, and an overall joy to work with. I truly cannot recommend her and the Everson Events team enough!

I cannot say enough good things about Rebecca, Meghann, and this company. My wedding far exceeded my hopes and dreams, and I owe all the credit of that achievement to Wedding Expectations. We communicated often and in great detail. Any and all questions I had were answered and any problems were sorted out quickly. The planning leading up to the wedding was an unbelievable amount of work, but these ladies handled it with grace and professionalism. Wedding Expectations handled nearly every aspect of my wedding, from tablecloths and napkin folds to flower arrangements and seating charts. Every single detail was coordinated. They spoke regularly with outside vendors and the venue, often juggling several lines of communication simultaneously. The day-of coordination was out of this world. I have no doubt Meghann would have brought me the moon if I had asked for it. My wedding went off without a hitch. It was the best day of my life, and I owe it all to Wedding Expectations. From the depths of my soul, thank you Rebecca and Meghann!! If you have no idea where to start with planning your wedding, and you're feeling a bit overwhelmed, you've found the right people to help guide you towards your happily ever after.

One of the best things you can do for yourself is hiring a day-of coordinator, and Alyssa is an amazing choice!! She and her team worked so hard to make sure the day went smoothly for me. It was a magical day and I credit that in huge part to Alyssa's organization and ability to direct the circus behind the scenes. Book her!!

Working with Jenya was truly a dream. She poured her whole heart into planning our outdoor wedding and brought our vision to life more beautifully than we ever imagined. Even when it rained — something that would normally send any couple into a panic — she handled everything so seamlessly that I didn’t even notice. And on top of that, she worked with a bride who could never make up her mind. Through every change, every new idea, and every “wait…what if we did this instead?” moment, she stayed patient, supportive, and genuinely excited to help us get it right. Her calm, creativity, and kindness made the entire process feel easy and fun. Every detail felt thoughtful, intentional, and perfectly us. Thanks to her, our wedding day was not only stunning, but completely stress-free. We are endlessly grateful and cannot recommend her highly enough!

We worked with Kate and Adri for just over a year on our wedding at Kimball Terrace in Park, City in September 2025, and to say it was the best decision we made is the understatement of the century. From the get-go, Kate and Adri were organized, broke down the process in steps that were easy to manage/follow. They were our best and most trusted advisors on each and every detail. We live in FL and were planning our wedding mostly remotely, and we felt so confident with each and every vendor. Kate and Adri also have the most beautiful eye for wedding design. My husband was in awe when we went to see our mock table set up during the planning process and everything looked incredible. Ahead of the wedding, Kate and Adri went into overdrive making sure every detail would be perfect. All my friends and co-workers kept asking me in the weeks leading up to my wedding how I was feeling and how I was so calm and easygoing, and I owe it all to Kate and Adri! Throughout the whole wedding planning and day-of wedding, Kate and Adri made us feel like royalty and we all (my husband and I and our families) kept saying 'Thank goodness for Kate and Adri, we could not do this without them.' I would highly, highly recommend working with Kate and Adri if they are available for your wedding date. It will be the best decision you make for your wedding (and yourself!)!

Working with Irene was truly one of the best decisions we made. She handled so many behind-the-scenes logistics beautifully - things we didn’t even know were happening until after the fact. From gracefully pivoting plans during last-minute rain to running down electrolytes for the bride, she made sure every moment ran seamlessly and stress-free. What amazed us most was how she completely understood our vision - from just a few hastily compiled images that we sent her - and brought it to life perfectly. Somehow, she sourced vendors and design details that perfectly matched our style and personalities. Irene is incredibly well-connected and curated a team of fantastic vendors, all while being supportive and pressure-free when we chose an external recommendation. She was also unbelievably responsive - no question too small, no late-night worry too inconvenient - and managed our modified Hindu ceremony with such grace, warmth, and respect for our traditions. It meant the world to us that she honored our culture so thoughtfully. We both work long hours and didn’t have much time to plan, but Irene pulled everything together with little direction and made it feel effortless. On top of that, her value for money is unmatched - she delivers top-tier service without the ego or markup you often find in the wedding world. We can’t imagine our wedding weekend without her. If you want a planner who’s calm under pressure, impeccably organized, endlessly responsive, and genuinely invested in creating something magical for you - Irene is the one.

I couldn’t have done it without her! She went above and beyond. From meeting me in person for a consolation, doing my venue walk through, setting up my event, staying to make sure my guests were happy and cleaning up afterwards.
