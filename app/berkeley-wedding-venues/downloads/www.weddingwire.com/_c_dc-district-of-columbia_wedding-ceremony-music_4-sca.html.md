5.0 out of 5 rating 

5.0 

We hired Mike for a family member wedding after he was highly recommended by a friend of ours, and he was absolutely amazing. His song selection was incredibly impressive, and he was a pleasure to work with from start to finish. We sent him a list of songs we wanted to hear, and even though he had to learn a couple of them, he absolutely nailed them. He also took requests from our guests without hesitation and did an excellent job interacting with everyone throughout the night. His pricing was very reasonable compared to other musicians we looked into, many of whom were significantly more expensive. We also learned that he regularly performs at music venues, which gave us even more confidence in his talent. I highly recommend Mike and will definitely use him again for future parties.

This group made the process very easy, they dressed professionally, and had a large variety of songs to choose from. Our guests talked about the song choices for days after! Very grateful for their professionalism and skill. They elevated our guests experience significantly. If it's in your budget, book them!

We booked Melissa for a harp + violin duo for our wedding ceremony and cocktail hour, and her and Janet really blew us away with beautiful arrangements! One guest remarked they wished the music could have gone the whole night! We were so impressed by Melissa’s extensive repertoire. The selections of classical and contemporary music really made the ceremony feel magical.

My wife and I had the best experience working with Maestra Ensemble for our August 2024 wedding in DC. Eleanor and Maestra Ensemble were incredibly professional and proactive every step of the way. We really appreciated their detailed song list and how much input we were able to have for the songs played. I also found the pacing of their communication leading up to the wedding to be perfect -- I never found myself in limbo wondering when the next time I'd hear from Eleanor would be. The day of our wedding, they arrived on time and without issue, and put together a great performance during our ceremony and cocktail hour. We've had so many guests tell us how much they enjoyed Maestra Ensemble's performance. We can't say enough good things about Maestra Ensemble -- they were a pleasure to work with at every point of our wedding planning process.

I booked the String Quartet for my wedding last spring and was very happy with their performance. They played for the ceremony and the cocktail hour. I asked them if they could play my favorite song to walk down the aisle, and they were very responsive and were able to find the sheet music for the song and perform it. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a string quartet for their wedding!

Sage String Quartet added a touch of pure elegance to my daughter’s recent wedding ceremony. From my very first call with Sean, I knew we had made the right decision. His responsiveness, accessibility, and advice on the selection of pieces were invaluable in achieving an overall beautiful and memorable ceremony. The musicians worked seamlessly with the church organist and music director to collaborate on scores for the various pieces, prompting the organist to later comment that he ‘wished he could play every wedding with them!’. All the guests remarked on how special the quartet’s participation was in the ceremony. Sage String Quartet has my highest recommendation!

Gretchen helped put together a duo of a Cello and Violin. Their song selection was amazing and gave us a ton of flexibility in choosing songs that we wanted for both the ceremony and cocktail hour. The price was reasonable, and we are so glad we hired Perfect Harmony. The strings gave a perfect compliment to the band playing later in the evening.

I wanted something different, and I just LOVED my ceremony music. I had a brass quintet, led by Charlie Peterson, do a fairly classical repertoire for most of the processional and recessional components, with one important exception: as my husband walked down the aisle with his best man, the quintet broke into his alma mater's fight song. I had given Charlie the sheet music and an .mp3 of the song, and he promised he could do it - it sounded GREAT and made me smile from the 'ready room' around the corner. The guests, and my husband, loved it too. Then they did a spectacular job with the classical pieces. I think Charlie Peterson and his quintet are the great undiscovered wedding WIN in DC.
