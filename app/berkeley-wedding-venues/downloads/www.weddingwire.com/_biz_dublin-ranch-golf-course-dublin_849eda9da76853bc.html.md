A Dream Wedding Day—Even Through the Unexpected! 

Our wedding day didn’t go exactly as planned—but in the most beautiful way possible. From the moment we booked the venue, we knew we had found a hidden gem. The space was absolutely stunning and incredibly affordable compared to others we looked at. Every corner felt romantic and well thought out, and we were truly blown away by the value we received.  
  
But what made our experience truly unforgettable was Carolina, the venue coordinator. When a few unforeseen challenges came our way (as they sometimes do with weddings), Carolina handled every single issue with such grace, confidence, and calm. She truly became the hero of our day, stepping in and making adjustments without ever letting us feel stressed. Her professionalism and kindness turned potential chaos into seamless beauty.  
  
Thanks to her and the amazing team, our wedding turned out to be the most beautiful day of our lives. Everything came together in a way that felt magical. We were able to soak in every moment, surrounded by love and beauty, without worrying about a thing.  
  
If you’re considering this venue—don’t hesitate. You’ll get more than you pay for in all the best ways. We couldn’t be more grateful for the experience and for Carolina’s unwavering support. Our hearts are full!

50th Wedding Celebration

We couldn't have picked a more perfect location for our 50th Wedding Celebration than Dublin Ranch Golf Course. Carolina Perez, their Catering Sales & Marketing Director, was a true professional and incredibly helpful, guiding us through all the details from the menu and table arrangements to linen colors and the sound system. The May weather was beautiful, allowing our guests to mingle and enjoy appetizers and an open bar on the outside patio. Afterward, they moved into the main event room, where eleven beautifully decorated tables were set to welcome them. The venue was a resounding success with all our guests!

Dublin Ranch is Top Notch!

The staff at Dublin Ranch are true professionals. They are able to shift gears quickly and willingly when clients have changes. The reception space is perfect..not too big to be impersonal and cold. Not too small to feel cramped. The staff was friendly and accommodating.

Dublin Ranch Golf Course - nothing short of magical!

From the moment we toured the venue, we knew it was the perfect spot for our big day. The lush greenery and breathtaking golf course and amazing sunset setting created a fairytale atmosphere that made our reception unforgettable.  
  
Pros:  
Stunning Location: The garden itself is a beautiful blend of nature and elegance with an amazing patio. We had our cocktail hour outdoors in the patio with the most beautiful sunset as the backdrop. It felt intimate yet grand, and the photos were absolutely stunning.  
  
Flexible Indoor/Outdoor Options: We were able to choose both an outdoor feel and indoor reception space. The indoor ballroom was equally impressive with its high ceilings, crystal chandeliers, and spacious layout. We felt confident no matter the weather!  
  
Professional and Friendly Staff: The team at Dublin Ranch went above and beyond to make our day stress-free. From the wedding coordinator, Carolina to the service staff, everyone was incredibly organized, attentive, and made sure every detail was taken care of.  
  
Convenience: The venue offers ample parking, and the location is easy for our out-of-town guests to find. There’s also a bridal suite and groom's lounge, which made getting ready a breeze.  
  
Con: The venue has specific time/schedule restrictions on when food service can start and end which might be difficult to work around different events/reception events however the team was flexible for us to make the experience seamless.

The most beautiful Venue and perfect wedding.

We had our wedding at the Dublin Ranch Golf Course. We didn't know how to go about having a wedding but Caroline was super helpful and made sure our wedding went smooth. The communication and flexibility were so great! I highly recommend having a wedding here.

Our Indian Wedding 

Location was absolutely beautiful for any kind of wedding but sadly we had very bad weather on our wedding day but still, our indoor wedding was decent. Last min changes of decorations and plans. Little hectic but Dublin Ranch Golf team was very accommodating on changing the plan. Overall I had a decent Indian wedding and I am happy with it.

This venue is very elegant - from the exterior of the building to the simple sophisticated interiors (I love shutters). Plus the beautiful view out in the patio! Perfect for intimate gathering.  
A plus is it is very budget-friendly. They accept outside catering which really helped us meet our budget.

The price is very affordable and the venue looks amazing! Randie is very organized and covered all the bases. We met a few times in person, but also corresponded a lot through email and she was super responsive. We made some changes to the table arrangements as the day got closer and there were no complaints! Randie sent us the updated plan almost immediately. On the day of the wedding, everything was perfect and just as we expected. While Randie doesn't stay with you the entire day (that's the responsibility of the banquet captain), she was there to help guide us through the ceremony which was great because we had met with her for the rehearsal. My bridesmaids interacted with the banquet captain and mentioned that she was wonderful to work with as well. The golf course does back up against houses so our concern had been the noise level on our wedding day, but every time we went there it was generally quiet. On our wedding day, there was a little bit of noise, but I barely heard it and no one else did. Overall, very happy and would recommend them to anyone!
