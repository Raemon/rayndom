Velma

5.0 out of 5 rating 

5.0 

My wife, Vel, and I celebrated our wedding reception at Castillo de Lilo on Monday, February 5, 2024. Marco & Ericka went above & beyond. Vel & I originally wanted a typical Costa Rican dinner, and they provided us with a complimentary dinner sampling when we came to scout the locations in August of 2023. We decided to scrap that idea and go with a hybrid of their menu options. Marco is a top chef! On the evening of our wedding reception, Vel and I had planned to change outfits, but I forgot to add them to the transport pile, so only my black slacks made it. I can only blame myself for that error! Vel, in a panic, I assume, said I would come out shirtless. I knew that that was how I would end the night, but Ericka wasn't having it, so she immediately took me to Marco's work closet and grabbed me a dress shirt. What a lifesaver! The dress shirt you can see me wearing in the pics I've added is Marco's, and it looks fabulous! Vel & I were also having issues with our wire transfer, so Ericka came to where we stayed with a credit card reader to get it done. Once again, thank you! Vel & I highly recommend Castillo de Lilo, Marco, and Ericka!
