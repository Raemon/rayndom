Nothing short of amazing

We had our wedding at maneeleys and sandy, Lisa and their team went above and beyond to work with us and our vendors and make our day truly magical. Guests couldn’t stop talking about how amazing the food was, how well thought out everything we did was and how lovely it was decorated and organized. Sandy and Lisa were SUPER attentive day of to make sure we had everything we wanted and needed for our special day. Sandy was the biggest help leading up to the big day organizing everything under the sun and I was very type A and brought specific instructions for setup-which she followed perfectly! Again- I couldn’t recommend maneeleys, sandy, Lisa and the team any more! They’re truly amazing and wouldn’t have wanted our special day anywhere else. Thank you!!!

Amazing Venue 

Maneeley's and Sandy/her staff were absolutely amazing. Sandy is in contact with you many times before your wedding day to make sure everything goes amazing. It rained on my wedding day and Sandy and her team made sure to have a backup plan that was still amazing. Her and her staff were so attentive to me, my husband, and wedding party. I would not be happier with how my wedding turned out and the venue is gorgeous. The venue offers so many amazing decorations which we beautiful and so helpful.

Christmas in July

We had a Christmas in July theme wedding and the staff at Maneely's went out of their way to help make it happen. They pulled out their Christmas decorations to add to what we brought to make our day that much more special. The food options were amazing and delicious to boot. Plenty to choose from, but the best part about Maneely's is the staff. Sandy, Lisa and their team are simply amazing. They go above and beyond to accommodate all your needs. They made our day stress free and I can not thank them enough. If you are looking for a wedding venue or just a party venue this is the place. You will not be disappointed. They will also cater an event off site for you and you will not be disappointed. Take my word for it. The staff and service here are 100% top notch.   
Thank you all again for an amazing day for our Christmas in July

The perfect day! 

My husband and I recently had our wedding at Maneeley's, and we truly cannot say enough good things about our experience! From the initial tour to the final send-off, everything went smoothly, and we couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our special day.  
  
Sandy and her team were absolutely amazing! They were so easy to work with and went above and beyond to ensure every detail was taken care of. Sandy listened to our vision and exceeded our expectations in every way. It’s clear that she truly loves what she does, and she puts her heart into each wedding she coordinates. We never felt like we were just another couple – she made our day feel uniquely ours and incredibly special.  
  
The venue itself is stunning, with a variety of beautiful locations to choose from for the ceremony. The many décor options made wedding planning so much easier and stress-free, and we were able to create the exact atmosphere we had envisioned. The flexibility in ceremony locations was a huge plus, and we were thrilled with the setting we chose.  
  
When it came to the food, Maneeley’s truly exceeded all expectations. Our guests are still raving about how delicious everything was! The portion sizes were generous – no one left hungry! The drink selection was also fantastic, and our guests loved the Champagne and signature cocktails. It’s clear that the venue takes pride in offering high-quality food and drinks.  
  
Overall, we couldn’t be happier with our choice of venue. Sandy and her staff made our wedding day flawless, and we’ll be forever grateful for the care and attention they put into making our day so memorable. If you’re looking for a beautiful, stress-free wedding venue with exceptional service and amazing food, we highly recommend Maneeley’s!

Amazing from start to finish!

From the moment we booked the venue until the last dance of our wedding day, everything went flawlessly! Sandy is absolutely amazing—always available to chat and answer all questions I have via email, phone, or in person. They are very organized and it is obvious they are experts at what they do. We chose this venue not only for its stunning interior but also for the incredible value, with so many thoughtful inclusions in their packages. We did bring some of our own decorations, but otherwise, most everything was provided by Maneeley's. I highly recommend adding the drapery—it truly elevates the space and adds an elegant touch. Sandy and her team handled all the setup, so all we had to do was show up! Their attention to detail allowed me to feel completely stress-free on our big day, giving me the freedom to fully enjoy every moment. The first time I saw the lodge decorated for our wedding day I sobbed happy tears it was beautiful. So many of our guests also complimented how tasty the food was. The venue is absolutely beautiful inside and out and I highly recommend booking your wedding day with Maneeley's.

A Night to Remember! 

My husband and I would highly recommend Maneeleys to any couple in search for their wedding venue. Sandy made the entire experience from start to finish stress free and enjoyable. Sandy and the team at Maneeleys turned my dream wedding into a reality. They are very responsive with any questions and provide everything you could need for your wedding day to run smoothly. All of our guests mentioned how wonderful the venue was and how it was the best wedding they had been to in a long time. We are more than happy with our experience with Sandy and Maneeleys, we would choose them every time! We want to take this time to extend our gratitude for the best wedding day we could have ever asked for.

Maneeley’s is the perfect venue!!

Maneeley’s was one of the best choices we made when it came to our wedding. They were excellent from start to finish. They did everything for us, from decorating to cleaning up to loading our car at the end of the night! The food was excellent. The staff were all amazing, they were extremely helpful and they went above and beyond to make our experience great. Sandy worked with us directly and she was heaven sent. She has been doing this for years she knows what she’s doing and it shows. She was always available and if she didn’t have an answer she would get back to us extremely fast with a solution to any question that I had. She made our experience fantastic. The venue itself was beautiful and I feel like my pictures came out of a magazine. It is well kept and gorgeous inside and out. They offer a lot in their packages which I noticed other venues did not offer nearly as much. Maneeley’s was a 10/10 and I recommend it to everyone!! We had the perfect day

I absolutely love to work at Maneeley's Banquets! The property has two beautiful rooms which offer their own unique style for receptions and the grounds are well groomed for ceremonies and a variety of photo opportunities. The menu options are delicious and well prepared. I applaud the owner, Bruce and the banquet manager, Sandy for going above and beyond the norm for their clients and their vendors!
