My family photographer for life!!

I will always support a business operated in love. I’m so grateful to have connected with Hart Portraits, I am a mom of 4 and the way Desrae effortlessly captures our family all while being so patient and understanding with the kids really stood out to me and is the reason we keep coming for our family photos!!

In-home photoshoot

Des’rae is very professional from start to finish. I booked our session online. Des’rae was punctual and very friendly upon arrival. My daughter was 3 months old at the time and Des’rae was extremely patient with her. I received my photos before the estimated turnaround time. I was and still am very pleased with the pictures she managed to capture of my daughter! Highly recommend working with her for any event!
