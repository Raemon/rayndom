I was hired to plan a Celebration of Life on short notice and reached out to Kylie for the funeral pieces, as well as the floral arrangements for the luncheon after the funeral. Kylie was amazing and even worked into the night to get the order set. She was flexible and creative and her work was better than the client imagined. Her florals were fresh, full, fragrant, and beautiful! I look forward to working with her on my future events. Kylie is a ROCK STAR! Patty, Creative Coordination Meridian, ID

I provided LD and his staff with some inspiration pictures from pinterest and my budget and gave them creative freedom to create my bouquets, corsages and boutonnieres and they were stunning. They absolutely caught my vision and surpassed it! Having an October wedding, my heart was set on leaves and white pumpkins as decor on the tables and mantle. His staff went to a pumpkin patch and gathered medium sized white pumpkins to spell our last name along the mantle and one with our married monogram. They also found mini white pumpkins that they assembled with leaves and pine cones in hurricane vases for the table centerpieces. They also made a wreath with the leaves and some berries for above the mantle. It was simple, captured fall and perfect for a morning wedding and to utilize for the rest of the autumnal season. I highly recommend LD and his team! They are extraordinary and really go above and beyond to deliver your vision perfectly including multiple consults. They also provided the leaves for guests to throw as we made our exit. The best part is that leaves and pine cones were treated and can be used for years to come!
