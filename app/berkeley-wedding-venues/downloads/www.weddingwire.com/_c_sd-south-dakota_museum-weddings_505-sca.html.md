I cannot day enough about how awesome Alyson is at the Washington Pavilion! She was so amazing to work with through the whole wedding process. We held our ceremony in the visual arts center and it was stunning. It was such a unique space to get married in and I am so thankful we decided on this location for this special occasion. I would highly recommend everyone to look into this space for smaller weddings!

We LOVED having the Old Courthouse Museum as our venue. It was gorgeous and Staci was wonderful to work with. It was great having an outdoor venue for the ceremony and such a fun indoor venue for the reception. The flexibility to bring in our own alcohol was great as well. The only harder thing is the kitchen is not a full catering kitchen so some things are harder to bring in. And there are some restrictions like no candles or glitter, but those are minor.
