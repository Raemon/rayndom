Best decision ever!!

As a bride, I had a vision for our ceremony, and Erica not only understood it but brought it to life in a way that exceeded all our expectations.  
  
She took the time to get to know us as a couple, asking thoughtful questions that helped personalize our ceremony. Her warmth and genuine enthusiasm made us feel at ease, and we could tell she was just as excited about our big day as we were. The ceremony was beautifully crafted, blending our love story with meaningful traditions, and it truly reflected who we are as a couple.  
  
I cannot recommend Erica enough! If you are looking for someone who is not only an expert in their craft but also genuinely cares about making your day special, she's your girl! We are so grateful for the beautiful memories she helped create with such ease. Thank you, Erica, for making our day unforgettable!

Thank you Erica! 

Erica was wonderful! She worked with us closely to create the perfect ceremony that was exactly what we envisioned, it was short but personal and sweet. She was easy to communicate with, reliable and very organized. She even came the day before for our rehearsal. Thank you Erica!

What a Wonderful experience

If you are looking for an officiant look no further, our experience with Erica could not have been better, Erica is so kind, professional and made our day the best we could imagine, not only did we need an officiant somewhat at the last minute she travelled to our venue. We cannot say enough to express our admiration and appreciation for Erica.

Erica with Kismet is amazing!

Erica was amazing! She spent time with us on several occasions. Getting our entire love story and personalized every word of our ceremony. It made it so special for her to include such small loving details. She has the most incredible, calming energy and we were so grateful she was a part of our special day.

Erica is amazing!

Erica was so great to work with, our first officiant cancelled on us super last minute, and Erica was very accommodating on short notice. but she still spent the time with us and got all the details to make sure everything was just as we imagined!

Hire erica!

From the beginning Erica was vested to provide us with a meaningful wedding ceremony. She took the time to get to know us and understand what was important to us about our wedding day, AND what was important to us as a couple, helped us with crafting our personalized wedding vows and incorporated personal touches in the ceremony itself. Erica went above and beyond by traveling to scout our unseen location, provided video and pictures to help us envision and choose our specific ceremony site and to top it all off, traveled in a snowstorm to perform the ceremony. Through it all, she was so positive, thoughtful, professional and fun. We can’t thank Erica enough for making our destination elopement more special than we had hoped. If you want a truly Kismet ceremony, you simply must hire Erica!

The key to our amazing day! 

Erica from Kismet Moment was the KEY to our amazing ceremony. We could not have done it without her. She met with us beforehand to make sure it was everything we both wanted. It was personalized, creative, and beautiful. We could not have asked for more! I would highly recommend her to anyone and everyone!
