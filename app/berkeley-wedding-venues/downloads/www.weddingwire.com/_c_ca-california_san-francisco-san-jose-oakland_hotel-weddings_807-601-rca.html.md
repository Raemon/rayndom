We had celebrated our daughters wedding in July that included multiple events over three days, each event requiring a whole new entirely different set up for a large number of guests around 250 most of them staying in the hotel . It was a celebration that included a bridal ceremony, Baraat on a horse entering so elegantly through the elephant gate, a groom’s welcome ceremony in the court yard, a Hindu wedding ceremony, two lunch Buffets in restaurant and foyer, buses to catholic church and back for a catholic ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner reception, late night snacks and drinks and two breakfasts . We had our final meeting with Jasmine, the catering sales manager of Nia on Tuesday and she presented to us every single detail with maps which gave us tremendous comfort . As our guests arrived at Nia on Thursday and Friday they were greeted very warmly by the staff with Champagne and chocolates . As they entered their rooms their welcome baskets and special gifts were already placed in the rooms by the Nia staff under the leadership of front desk manager Mustafa who is fantastic and still remembered by name by our guests after three months. Jason their audio visual guy was excellent in making sure there were enough speakers in the ball room as well as in the courtyard and fully in control with his staff making sure the correct music played for each occasion in all areas and this included two live bands and multiple change overs of recorded music . The table set ups both indoor and outdoor that required change for each event were done expertly, efficiently and looked fabulous and the staff were so attentive to our guests. Guests had so much fun with several options all through the weekend - to dance in the ball room , to chat in the foyer, sit around the fire pits in courtyard , play games and more during the entire weekend. The rooms and the decor in the hotel were very modern and the openness of the outdoor courtyard with its very distinctive animal figurines brought a unique touch . We felt that every single detail was taken care of and many guests remarked that it was the best wedding they have been to . Our experience as parents of the bride at Nia was extraordinary and we have wonderful memories for a life time.

We recently celebrated our engagement ceremony at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel, Berkeley Marina, and it was an absolute dream come true! From the moment we began planning, the entire team at DoubleTree went above and beyond to ensure every detail was perfect for our special day. Their level of cooperation and collaboration was unparalleled. They worked tirelessly with us, listening attentively to our ideas and desires, and offering valuable insights to make our event truly unforgettable. No detail was too small for them to handle, and their dedication to excellence was evident in every aspect of the planning process. On the day of the event, we were blown away by the professionalism and warmth of the staff. From the event coordinators to the servers, everyone treated us and our guests with the utmost care and respect. They anticipated our needs before we even had to ask, ensuring that everything ran smoothly from start to finish. The venue itself was stunning, with breathtaking views of the Berkeley Marina that provided the perfect backdrop for our celebration. The atmosphere was elegant yet inviting, creating the ideal setting for our special day. We cannot thank the DoubleTree Hilton team enough for their outstanding service and hospitality. They truly exceeded our expectations in every way possible, and we feel incredibly grateful to have chosen them for our engagement ceremony. We wholeheartedly recommend DoubleTree Hilton, Berkeley Marina to anyone seeking a truly exceptional event experience

We had an intimate wedding reception in their Parkview room. The room view was spectacular and we were served a wonderful 3 course meal for our 25 guests. A big thanks to all of the banquet servers and planners for making it so easy.

The people working at the catering and events department are great! They are responsive, patient and very helpful in addressing all my questions/concerns. I planned my own wedding and they made my experience much easier since the venue took care of things such as catering, beverages, set-up, and some rentals. I must say that everyone I had the pleasure of dealing with were polite, helpful, and took their jobs seriously which made the experience as stress free as possible. The chef went out of his way to handle the dietary restrictions of my guests and the food was great. Good sized servings and tasty. The staff who worked my event were also friendly and accommodating. I received very positive feedback from my guests regarding the food, the atmosphere and the staff. Honestly, if I had to do it all over again, I'd still pick the same venue. I had a great wedding and I think that was largely because I chose the Hyatt Centric and worked with their wonderful staff.

If you’re looking for a wedding venue that combines timeless elegance, impeccable service, and a touch of San Francisco magic, look no further than the Palace Hotel. Nestled in the heart of downtown San Francisco, this historic gem offers a truly unforgettable experience for couples and their guests. From the moment we arrived, we truly felt like royalty. The Palace Hotel’s opulent surroundings took our breath away. The Sunset Court, with its panoramic glass ceiling, provided a stunning backdrop for our ceremony. As I walked down the sequin aisle toward my partner, I felt like a character in a fairy tale. The crimson-red flowers in the Ralston Ballroom added a touch of romance, and the entire ambiance was nothing short of enchanting. Jennifer Mitchell, our dedicated wedding specialist, was an absolute gem. Her meticulous planning and warm demeanor put us at ease throughout the entire process. She listened to our vision, offered creative ideas, and ensured that every detail was flawlessly executed. Jennifer’s commitment to excellence made our wedding day stress-free and magical. To the entire Palace Hotel team, thank you for making our dream wedding a reality. Your dedication, professionalism, and warmth touched our hearts. We’ll forever treasure the memories created within your historic walls.

The Omni made an incredible first impression on us. It’s a beautiful & grand space, but there was something very comfortable about it at the same time. That’s mainly due to Jano Paredes, our event coordinator. He was so welcoming & genuinely passionate about creating a special event for us. We toured two other venues, Julia Morgan & Webster Hall. While these two venues are beautiful, there weren’t nearly as caring or appreciative of our business as the Omni. The Omni made the stressful planning process enjoyable (we planned it in about 3 months!) & they were understanding when we had last minute changes & requests. They were also very flexible throughout the wedding planning. They even swapped out some of the beer in their package so they could bring in brands we liked better. Amanda Maggard is amazing. She managed the accommodations for all the guests. Many of our guests also commented on how incredible the check-in was. It was rainy that weekend, so the Omni was quick to offer complimentary umbrellas. They even gave each guest a free drink voucher at the hotel bar! Amanda also made sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable in the Presidential Suite, complete with champagne, ice buckets, & several glasses for my visitors. It’s a lovely space to take getting-ready pictures. I was originally worried the grand ballroom wasn’t going to fit our vision & was torn on using the same space for the ceremony & reception (they have another room available if you’d prefer not to do this), but it was gorgeous! The spaces felt totally unique between the ceremony & the reception. The grand ballroom really provides a blank slate to create something beautiful & it can be difficult to appreciate when it’s completely empty. The mezzanine where the cocktail hour was held is beautiful & needs no additional decorations & the dim sum buffet was a huge hit. Guests loved the reception dinner menu. We went with a plated dinner selection of sea bass, chicken, or oyster mushrooms. The crab soup was delicious & by far the most popular. The passion fruit cheesecake was exceptional, but we also offered our guests a lovely Marjolaine cake slice. Later that evening, the Presidential suite where I initially got ready was transformed into our honeymoon suite. We were greeted with chocolate covered strawberries, champagne, & two custom Omni robes with our initials embroidered on them (my new initials since I was changing my name). It was so touching that it brought tears to our eyes. The Financial District was the optimal neighborhood to host our wedding. It was very safe & picturesque. We had a several family members nervous about coming to San Francisco because of the negative media coverage, but they all fell in love with the city by the end of the weekend. I know Webster Hall wouldn’t have given us the same treatment (they didn’t seem to care if they had our business or not). Julia Morgan was wonderful, but with the Omni, we just had a feeling we’d be in the best possible hands by people who genuinely cared, & we were right. Now, we love the Omni so much that we had Valentine’s Day at Monte’s two weeks after our wedding & the hotel surprised us with dessert & champagne, as well as a card signed by their staff congratulating us on our wedding. It’s a bar we now frequent because of the quality of service, food/drinks, & of course, our wonderful memories there. The Omni was the absolute best decision of our entire wedding.

My daughter and son in law's wedding parties, family and wedding guests stayed at the Marriott San Jose, and had such a pleasant experience! We worked closely with Alyssa and Gig, who helped coordinate block rooms, day after brunch, welcome bags for the guests upon their arrival, all the way down to having special goodies in the bride and groom's rooms when they first got there. We were warmly greeted by valet and front desk, and everyone was so helpful with the day after brunch in Arcadia! I would definitely recommend this hotel and their fine staff!

In grade school, I dreamt of getting married at the iconic Westin St. Francis in San Francisco. This past April, that dream came true and it was even more beautiful than I could imagine! If you ever get the pleasure to work with Jenevieve Beaulieu to plan your wedding and event, consider yourself privileged! While I will still always recommend hiring a third party wedding planner for any venue, Jenevieve made us feel like VIP clients. She went above and beyond to resolve every hiccup the arose between the hotel and our other vendors. She even tracked down rubberbands and post it notes for me the day of my rehearsal when we needed to wrangle our placards and other items. She was kind, she was energetic, and she wanted our day to be perfect. Thank you to Jenevieve and the entire Westin team for the wedding of a lifetime!
