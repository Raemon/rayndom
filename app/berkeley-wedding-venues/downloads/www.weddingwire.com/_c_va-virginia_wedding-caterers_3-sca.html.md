Harvest Moon Catering and MS Event Rentals were absolutely fantastic. The food was incredible—fresh, beautifully presented, and a huge hit with our guests. Cameron from Harvest Moon was especially wonderful: attentive, responsive, and on top of every detail from start to finish! He brought our vision to life and was a pleasure to work with. MS Event Rentals was equally impressive. Their bar setup and glassware were gorgeous and added such a polished, elevated look to our reception. Everything was delivered and arranged professionally, and their team was a pleasure to work with. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience with both companies. Highly recommend!

This was the perfect addition and surprise at our rehearsal dinner at our hot September wedding! The ice cream was perfect and creamy and the service was great!!! I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to add a dessert food truck to their event!

We had the pleasure of working with Traditions Catering for a wedding reception at Riverview Centre, and they truly exceeded expectations. I worked closely with Annie and Jimmy, and the experience was seamless from start to finish. As one of our Preferred Vendors, it absolutely showed. Their team was organized, professional, clean, and incredibly helpful, making the reception run smoothly not only for the couple and their guests, but also from a venue operations standpoint. Communication was clear, timelines were respected, and their attention to detail made a big difference on event day. From a Venue Manager perspective, it’s always refreshing to work with a catering team that understands the flow of a wedding day and operates as a true partner within the space. The couple had a wonderful experience — and honestly, it was even better on our end. We look forward to working with Traditions Catering again in the near future and highly recommend them for any wedding or special event!

We loved working with The Local Catering for our wedding! We also used their day-of-planning services and Kelly & Meridyth were absolutely amazing! The food was incredible and whenever we say we got married near Charlottesville and mention we had the Local cater, everyone says it is their favorite restaurant in the area. The tasting we did with our parents was amazing and everything was just as good on wedding day. Kelly & Meridyth were so helpful with coordinating our rentals and everything on wedding day went so smoothly! We couldn't recommend them enough!

Autumns custom catering was a pleasure to work with. They went the extra mile and really did everything they could to help us set up and clean up. The food is good, especially for the price. We loved the hot cocoa and coffee bar, it was perfect for a fall wedding!

Goodrich Gourmet was one of the best choices we made for our wedding. We wanted to show our favorite people some love and feed them something delicious on our big day. Goodrich Gourmet delivered on both loving our people well, and feeding them well. Our guests could not stop raving about the food and many helped themselves to second plates. The staff members we worked with were professional, kind, and genuinely seemed to love being part of our day. Our interactions were sprinkled with well wishes and reminders to enjoy the day, as well as questions to ensure we as the Bride and Groom had a chance to eat. It was clear that each of the staff loved being part of someone's celebration, and that they had not lost their joy for the wedding business. They made the logistics aspects so easy and were willing to make many adjustments for us throughout our wedding process, especially when we saw a big change to our guest count. Our bartender was wonderful, ensuring that there was never a line and that our guests quickly returned to the dance floor. The ladies helping us during dinner were so kind and attentive, always ensuring our drinks were refreshed and we always had a cold beverage waiting for us at our sweetheart table. We also opted to use our own plates and they diligently cleaned and repackaged them with care- truly going above and beyond. I cannot recommend this vendor highly enough for your next celebration.

Hank’s catered my wedding on May 2nd, and we couldn’t have been happier! The planning process was seamless thanks to Sabrina, the catering crew was punctual and professional, and best of all, the food was absolutely delicious! They were very flexible when we wanted to edit the cocktail hour appetizers, and it worked out perfectly. We did the buffet, and everything was a hit (the pulled pork and mac n cheese was my favorite). I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking to have the yummiest (and reasonably priced) food at their wedding!

We had a fantastic experience with Creative Catering of Virginia. They created a fully custom vegan and vegetarian menu for us and were incredibly flexible throughout the process. They took all of our feedback from the tastings and adjusted the menu until it was exactly what we wanted. The food was outstanding—everything was flavorful, well-cooked, and served promptly. We chose a buffet-style service and really loved that option; it worked smoothly and was a great fit for our event. Some standout favorites were the coconut tofu with mango sauce, stuffed mushrooms, gouda mac and cheese, portabella pasta, and the late-night burger sliders and potstickers. We received lots of compliments from our guests on how good the food was. The catering staff and bartenders were friendly, professional, and on point all night. They did a great job with our custom cocktails and handled everything seamlessly, including cutting and serving the cake. Overall, the food, service, and attention to detail were excellent, and we couldn’t have been happier with how everything turned out. We highly recommend them.

They were great especially with allergies my husband has a severe allergy and they were very on top of it. The food was unbelievable it was so good everyone told me plus when there is a wedding it’s hard to have hot food. All the food was hot. They were on top of everything and did very well. I highly recommend.

Early Katering not only has incredible food but has incredible people working the entire show behind the scenes! Early Katering is a family run business who is organized, punctual, accommodating, personable and kind. We got the beef medallions with red wine Marsala and pork loin with mushroom gravy with green beans and mashed sweet potatoes at our wedding which all was incredibly tender, cooked to perfection, delicious and all reasonably priced. They even accommodated to gluten/dairy intolerance for my family! Not to mention the BBQ Meatballs and spinach artichoke dip were to die for and are still talked about to this day. My now husband and I truly enjoyed getting to know and work with Early Katering and 100/10 recommend!
