Magical Wedding at Presidio

My son and his wife got married outdoors next to the Chapel with reception following at the Golden Gate Club. The wedding and rehearsal went so smoothly and everything was perfect! Both our son and his wife have busy jobs so working with Wedgewood was great for them. Wedgewood acts as the wedding planner. Everything was organized and laid out in a helpful book along with in person meetings. We were so happy with how everything went and would highly recommend!!

A dream come true!

My husband and I got married last month at the Golden Gate Club in San Francisco. Everything was an absolute dream! From the beginning, we enjoyed working with the wedding coordinators we were assigned to, Violet and Chloe. They were the best!!! They were quick to respond to all of our questions throughout the months of planning and especially during the final weeks leading up to our wedding day. We loved the vendors that partner with Golden Gate Club including Angella floral design, immobileDJ, Mazzettis the food at the venue, etc. Would 100% recommend this venue and their vendor partners to anyone looking to have a special event in a large, unique space surrounded by lush with a grand view of the bay and Golden Gate Bridge.

Great location 

We just had our wedding and we had such an amazing time. Kennedy was our coordinator and she did such a great job. It was in our budget and the vendor took care of all our needs and included the extra things in the price. Highly recommend if you want a wedding in SF!

The Wedding of Our Dreams

Can't say enough good things about the Wedgewood team at Golden Gate Club. We had the wedding of our dreams, lead by the help of the incredible Kennedy. She helped make sure all of our details came together, and was responsive, timely, and caring like she was a member of our family.   
On the day of the wedding, absolutely everything about the service, the food, the ambiance was as good as we hoped it would be. Our guests and family were so impressed, and had nothing but amazing things to say. We can't recommend this place enough!

Best wedding I have attended!

I went to a wedding a few weekends ago and it was one of the best experiences I have had! Great dinner and bar service. Music was so fun and the dancefloor was always full. The venue's staff was great and always smiling. Would definitely recommend to a friend!

Excellent all in one wedding vendor

The team at the Presidio is now Wedgewood Weddings and they provide an easy wedding planning experience with many options and preferred vendors to work with. We were rescheduling from 2020 with them so we brought in most of our own vendors but I did get to work with Avonne with Rosedale Florist and she was excellent. The day of team were excellent and my wedding was beautiful and went off without a hitch.

Please, please avoid. 

Head for the hills. While the Wedgewood seems like a turn-key wedding experience, the devil is in the details. And by devil, I mean Satan.   
  
Picture this: your fiancé is sold on a wonderfully supportive staff and group that is responsible for executing your vision. Your fiancé then pours hours of time and energy into the planning with the only expectation arising out of Wedgewood’s fulfillment of its promise to do what it says it will: follow instructions.  
  
Enter Satan. Each instruction we provided was ignored. To the point where we thought it was done intentionally.   
  
(1) we asked the wedgewood to make sure the band played during cocktail hour. Ignored.   
  
(2) we asked Wedgwood to correctly reflect the date of our wedding in the photo both. Ignored.  
  
(3) we asked Wedgewood to instruct our band to call out when speeches were to occur and cue the speakers to keep our event running on time. Ignored.   
  
(4) we asked Wedgewood to make sure our band payed for the allotted time we paid for. Ignored. This cost us $4,000.00  
  
(5) we asked Wedgewood to call out the cake cutting at a designated time. Ignored.   
  
Big thumbs down to Juliana, who should be fired. She screwed up every single thing above. She’s not a day of coordinator - she’s a useless statue. Worst of all, she notified my fiancée two hours prior to the event ending that she was “taking off” after failing to look after anything above.   
  
Don’t count on Wedgwood if your life depended on it. It sucks hard.

Wedding Planning Nightmare 

I booked Wedgewood back in November of 2021 for our wedding in September of 2022. They required a deposit of $10k. Long story short I became unexpectedly pregnant and had a due date of September 2022. I tried to work with Wedgewood on rescheduling our date to 2023 but they refused and kept the whole deposit. They are super unprofessional and only care about your money. Please save yourself the potential nightmare and go with another vendor.
