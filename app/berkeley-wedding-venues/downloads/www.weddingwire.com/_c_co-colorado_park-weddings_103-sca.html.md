I can’t say enough great things about this venue. They helped make our wedding day absolutely perfect. They were friendly, professional and willing to accommodate all of my needs. We’ve had so many guest compliments on everything from the food to the decor.

We cannot say enough about how much we loved Hudson Gardens! My husband and I were the videographers for a gorgeous wedding there this past fall. Working there as a vendor gave us a unique perspective on such a special place. First of all, we had the pleasure of working with their wonderful special events manager, Erin Smith. From the moment we met with her at the venue, she made us feel right at home. While watching her work behind the scenes, it was very clear that she has an eye for detail and goes above and beyond for her clients. I can say firsthand, it's important to have a kind, hard working person in your corner for your wedding day—and there is no better person than Erin!! The wedding ceremony was located in The Rose Garden, and the reception in The Bloom Room. The garden was gorgeous and had an intimate feel. The beautiful flowers and fountain backdrop were absolutely stunning. As a videographer, we can say that The Bloom Room was one of our favorite reception spaces we've worked at. It was spacious with 360 windows (that could even open up!), giving plenty of natural light during the day, and a comfortable open air feel in the evening. Overall, it was easy to see that the couple and their guests were having an amazing time. Their top-notch staff kept the event running smoothly, and created a great guest experience. It was such a pleasure working at Hudson Gardens! If you're hoping for the perfect garden wedding, look no further! We highly recommend this wonderful venue, and cannot wait until we are able to work here again!

Where do I even begin... Copper Mountain Resort truly went above and beyond to make our wedding weekend unforgettable! We've been skiing at Copper for (10+) years, and the moment we visited The Aerie right after it opened, we knew it was the place to host our celebration. There’s no way we could imagine our wedding anywhere else. This lodge is brand new, with modern, sleek, and clean finishes that have a Scandinavian vibe. It doesn’t feel like your typical mid-mountain ski lodge, which made it feel extra special for our event. We had the pleasure of working with Courtney, and she was incredible! She was always just a message away, and communication was seamless. She guided us every step of the way, and we couldn’t have asked for better support. Forage & Feast at The Aerie catered our wedding, and our guests (near and far) still rave about how it was some of the best food they’ve ever had at an event! The Copper Mountain team made it so easy for our vendors to set up, even with the challenge of it being winter and all our décor, florals, centerpieces, and DJ equipment needing to be loaded onto the gondola. We were fortunate to have the outdoor patio for our ceremony, then move inside where we basically had the whole building for our reception. Anytime we had to make last-minute adjustments or pivots, we knew we were in great hands with Courtney and the team. Our ‘Welcome Party/Apres Ski Party’ at Downhill Duke's was the perfect way to kick things off — unforgettable moments on the deck with sunshine, music, food, and drinks. It's also pet friendly, so our dog-son Duey was able to join the event! We can't thank Copper Mountain, The Aerie, and the entire team enough for making our dream wedding come to life and a weekend we won't every forget!

We've used this space several times for a large annual meeting. Ample room for a large number of round tables. Amazing views and everyone always loves the easy access to the attached patio spaces. Convenient and large kitchen adjoining the space. Good quality in-house A/V available. Very friendly and helpful staff (each year, Shane Haack has consistently made our event easy to contract, set up the logistics, and navigate on event day).

The venue is gorgeous and exactly what we pictured for an outdoor ceremony and tented reception. Our guest raved about how beautiful the venue was and also really enjoyed staying on site at the cabins/motel. Ashley was extremely helpful for both the rehearsal and before/during the ceremony. If you are looking for a low key, beautiful outdoor venue in the foothills, I highly recommend Stone Mountain!

The Evergreen Lake House is a great venue for a wedding in Evergreen. The team who manage it are very professional, good communicators and made sure all went to plan. Would definitely recommend for an iconic wedding location.

Everyone at Four Mile Historic Park was so helpful and such a perfect place for our wedding. They let us come by multiple times to take measurements and plan out the layout of our reception. They even allowed us to do a rehearsal the day before the wedding during their business hours. It is so beautiful and have so many services available, including hay rides and horse drawn carriages! Definitely perfect for the laid back, DIY bride!

We held my daughter's ceremony and reception at the Big Horn Mountaintop Lodge at the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park in Canon City, Colorado. The venue was gorgeous, the service was wonderful and the food was truly amazing. We feel like all the folks we had dealings with at the Royal Gorge are like friends to us now. Thanks so much to them! We were truly blessed! Special thanks to Dorothy, Blane and Mary!!! Truly professional!
