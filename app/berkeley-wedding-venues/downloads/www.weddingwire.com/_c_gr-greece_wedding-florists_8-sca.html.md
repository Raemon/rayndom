I cannot recommend highly enough using Wedding Wish for your wedding. They were really quick to respond to all my emails and questions and the incredible floral arrangement and welcome sign they produced made our welcome party. It is difficult planning a wedding in another country but Wedding Wish came through with flying colors.

Filanthi Floral Design fulfilled my expectaitions for my wedding day more than I could have ever imagined. Christiana (owner of the business) was always very responsive to any queries and concerns we had. She immediately grasped the style of the decoration we wanted and her proposals were amazing and tailored to our needs. The final result at the weddind ceremony and reception was exquisite. Our wedding decoration left the best of impressions to our guest. Quality of flowers was exceptional. Christiana is super talented. A true professional. Cannot recommend enough Filanthi Floral Design for any wedding (or other event) decoration!!!

Chris was incredibly responsive throughout the planning process. I didn't have a huge budget and we focused on the key elements. It was easy to work with her and the team. The best part of the experience I have to say was the day of, her team was there early getting everything set up, I had bought trinkets and things from the flea market to make unique Greek centerpieces, and expected to set it all up - instead Chris insisted they would do it and helped me arrange the centerpiece in a perfect way. Any stress I had about getting things setup was gone. We used a mix of artificial (hanging flowers for the ceremony) and real flowers (wedding table, bouquet) they were beautiful and fresh, exactly what I asked for. I am so grateful to the kindness of Chris and the team in helping make my day full of joy!
