Trevor, you were so incredible! Thank you for bringing the vibes on our special day. I LOVED walking down the aisle to Moon River! And the songs you played during cocktail hour were so unique and fun! Appreciate you!

Samantha was incredibly professional and maintained great communication with me up until our wedding day. We went with a string trio and they sounded absolutely incredible. These ladies are truly so talented and they made our wedding so special and extra memorable.

They’re a family of four. Very professional, punctual, easy to work with, and played beautifully! We highly recommend this group for any holiday or special occasion. By the end of their set we were all moved to tears and full of gratitude on what we had just witnessed. Most of our family is musically talented so to see tears rolling down their face speaks volumes on how great this quartet is.

We had the loveliest music for our Wedding Ceremony and Cocktail Hour at the Bell Tower of W. 34th and we want to say THANK YOU to the String Trio musicians from Houston String Music. Not only were they easy to work with, they answered every single question we had, and were never bothered when we contacted them. They always said, “thank you for staying in touch”. They were willing and able to accommodate all of our special requests we made back in September. During the Cocktail Hour we had many older guests who really loved that the trio was able to play some of their oldie requests, too. THANK YOU!

We hired Scott Graham to play piano at our wedding, and he was incredible. He played beautifully during our ceremony and set the perfect tone for the moment. During cocktail hour, he brought great energy and skill, keeping the atmosphere lively and fun. Scott can literally play any song you throw at him, which amazed us and our guests. He was also extremely professional throughout the process. His music elevated our wedding day, and we couldn’t be happier. We would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for a talented pianist!

We hired Edina and her string quartet for our March 2024 wedding and are so glad we did! Her group played such gorgeous music - both songs we chose for the ceremony and songs they chose for the prelude. They even wrote and played a Taylor Swift song from scratch per my request for my entrance song. They sent me a recording of it ahead of time to make sure I liked it and worked with me to find the perfect moment to enter the ceremony room. We got so many compliments from our guests and I'm happy to recommend them to future brides!!!!

We used John and musical discovery team for our wedding ceremony music and they were fantastic. I got a ton of compliments on how nice it was from guests. John was very responsive and so easy to work with. They were able to accommodate my specific song choices and music requests. I would highly recommend them!
