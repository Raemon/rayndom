Your wedding day look isn't complete until you find a pair of shoes to match the rest of your ensemble. And while wedding heels and stilettos can add a few inches to your height, they're not always the most [comfortable options](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/comfortable-wedding-shoes), especially if you don't normally wear them in your everyday life. Enter: wedding flats. A stylish pair of bridal flats, such as [summery sandals](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-sandals) or ballerina flats, will keep you looking chic all day long without torturing your feet. And if you thought flats were only for casual dress codes, think again. Pointy-toe flats, such as D'Orsay styles, bring the same formality of heels, and you can dance the night away in them. And if you're wearing a [wedding jumpsuit](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/bridal-jumpsuits-for-weddings) or pantsuit, a pair of trendy loafers will be the ideal addition to your outfit. Now, check out 23 bridal-approved flats, including slingbacks, sandals, Mary Janes, and T-straps to wear on your big day.

## 

## Sparkly Slingback Flats 

These aisle- and dance floor-friendly slingbacks feature a rhinestone-embellished strap and pointed toe design. Choose from a champagne, silver, or black hue.
