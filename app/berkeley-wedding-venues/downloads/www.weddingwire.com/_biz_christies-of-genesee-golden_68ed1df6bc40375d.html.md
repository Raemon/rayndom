Amazing Venue

If I could give 10/5 stars I would. Upon arrival for the open house, I wasn’t stoked on going in. I had the venue searching burnout… But my fiancé insisted on going in and oh my goodness I am so grateful we did. The inside is so romantic, beautiful and Kerri, her husband and staff only made the experience better! Kerri responded to all of my emails quickly, which is a big deal to a control freak of a bride (me)!! I was against an all inclusive venue, but my mind sure did change fast and honestly, that helps take so much stress off of planning!! Fast forward, a few weeks before the wedding, we have our final meeting and they care about all your small details.. I never felt rushed, but they definitely care about providing amazing service. Now day of the wedding, we came in like a zoo! The tables were put together, the seating outside was ready. We set up and the Event manager Kara was nothing short of amazing. She was so kind, and anything I had questions about, I had immediate answers.. The other staff members were also just as amazing and so friendly to me guests. They told everyone when to walk and it was beautiful.. The food was amazing, it was warm and I had no complaints!! The photos do not do justice to how beautiful the venue is, nor how amazing the staff was.. Thank you guys so much for making my wedding so beautiful and for handling us all with so much care and kindness..

Very friendly and amazing staff!

We got married in September at this beautiful venue. The staff were all amazing and beyond helpful in every way possible! We had an issues with the whole mountain side losing power for about 45min (totally out of their control) they were very apologetic and brought out candles and a speaker from the kitchen to be able to continue the evening. Even brought out glow sticks for everyone and it was still so much fun and an amazing night! I would recommend this venue to anyone! It is as pictured and perfect for smaller more intimate weddings/receptions!

Best venue

Great and very organized, power did go out in the area during wedding, but they were prompt on getting lighting for us and glow sticks were so much fun. Great people and made it very memorable, I highly recommend them to anyone and the price was very low compared to other venues

My Perfect Wedding Venue! - Happiest Mr. & Mrs. 

It is an honor and privilege to provide this recognition to Christies of Genesee Wedding and Event Venue!   
  
Kerri, her husband and her entire team were absolutely a pleasure to meet and there aren’t enough words to express how grateful we are for their support and effort to make our dream wedding come to fruition. Their kindness and care for every single detail was by far one of my greatest experiences. The entire team was serviceable, attentive and made all our family and friends feel welcomed.   
  
From the first day, we met Kerri during an open house, we instantly knew this was exactly where we needed to be and I will add with less than 60 days to plan - everything we wanted, we found it!   
  
Kerri, also recommended several vendors that made everything so much easier for us. The chef did a marvelous job with our dinner selections. Everyone commented on how great the food selection was and tasted amazing. The venue in its entirety was absolutely amazing!   
  
From beginning to the end, everything was PERFECT!!! Sergio and I, are truly grateful and blessed to have found this venue for our special day. We loved it so much, that we only wish we could have a repeat of our wonderful wedding every year!   
  
Again, thank you so much for everything. This was a day that we will treasure FOREVER!   
  
Love,  
  
Brenda & Sergio

Fantastic venue - highly recommend 

I wanted to recommend Christie’s of Genese where we had our wedding on 05/29/2021. The owners are extremely nice, friendly and accommodating. A plus In customer service department. The place is so beautiful inside. They have a lot of neat decorations and the outside is so cute. The staff was amazing during the wedding and food was great. I don’t have a single bad word to say and I wholeheartedly recommend this venue. We had 46 people but they accommodate way more. It’s also not that far from Denver, it took us 45 minutes from Parker, plenty of parking, and awesome woods behind the venue to take pics with Mountain Views.

Amazing location and staff!

Christies is a beautiful, all-inclusive venue that has such a lovely rustic feel. It was perfect for our mountain wedding! Everything from the staff to the food was phenomenal, and we got so many compliments on how good the food was - definitely several steps above your typical wedding food! Special shoutout to Kerri, who was fantastic to work with and made planning a wedding during a pandemic as easy as it could possibly be!

Our wedding reception at Christie's was so beautiful and memorable, we're so glad we went with them!! We got nothing but compliments on the food, the venue itself, and the great atmosphere.

Best venue in town!

Christies of Genesee is a beautiful venue that overlooks the valley towards Denver. They have a wonderful outdoor patio for the ceremony with a great sound system. They have a large bar and huge dance floor. The staff was incredible and the owner's are amazing as well! Everything flowed seamlessly on the day of the event! There was never a line at the bar or a crowd in a door way. We especially love the food tastings and met new friends from it! I couldn't rank this venue any higher!! They are the best!
