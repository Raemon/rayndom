I truly cannot say enough positive things about Tammie and the team at Invitation Design Studio. I had all the confidence in the world about this member of our vendor team. Tammie is an incredible asset to have by your side throughout the wedding planning process. I learned so much from her about how to have a successful wedding through the design process. Their entire process is also impressively seamless. From beginning to create a vision from the save the date, to making the perfect invite and other signage, to material pick up, every detail was meticulously carried out. The communication was extremely clear, perfectly timed, collaborative, and just generally kind. The design process was easy, enjoyable and personalized. Every single detail is perfect and the quality is amazing. Don’t just have stock printed invites that everyone has, use this one opportunity to create something truly unique for your wedding. This family owned business is committed to excellence in their quality of every aspect of what they do. They are a genuinely kind family who will make you feel so supported and cared for, and will help you with way more than an invitation. I hope that you choose them to create the wedding of your dreams- we are thankful every day!

Matthew at Corrick's is AMAZING!! I found an invitation online that I loved, and that was within my budget. He worked directly with the company to ensure that I was able to order these invitations, had a proof made for us, made some very helpful suggestions. He has an excellent eye for detail (including the correct verbiage to use on our invitation), and was a pleasure to work with. I would highly recommend Corrick's for your wedding invitation needs!

I LOVED working with DESIGN design TROY. They made my wedding unique, stylish and classy. People were so impressed with all of their products that they designed and I got tons of compliments. They are also so easy to work with and very experienced in working with brides and grooms during this important time.

Working with Jacques has been the highlight of our event planning process! He was very hands on and attentive throughout the entire process from design to final product. He and his assistant, Munnie were always available to answer my many questions and were extremely patient with me as I made multiple changes to every aspect of the invitation and could not make up my mind. The entire time they NEVER became frustrated with me. This company is the exact kind of business that we should all support. Our invitations came out absolutely perfect and so elegant and formal. They used thick cardstock and raised print which made for a very fancy invitation that surpassed all my expectations. I will for sure use Hyegraph Invitations and Caligraphy again! Thank you, Jacques!!

I loved working with Diana at Emily Rose Papers during the wedding planning process! She is extremely creative, detail oriented, and passionate about what she does, and that shows in her work. I'm still in love with the invitations she designed for our wedding - they were unique, gorgeous, and truly set the stage for the wedding. It was an absolute pleasure working with Diana/Emily Rose Papers and I look forward to do so again in the future. I would highly recommend Diana/Emily Rose Papers because I know that you will not be disappointed in the product!
