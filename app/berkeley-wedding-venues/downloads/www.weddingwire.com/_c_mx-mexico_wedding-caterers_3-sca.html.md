We had the absolute pleasure of having Be You at our wedding in Cancun, and they were incredible! The cocktails were delicious, beautifully presented, and a huge hit with our guests. They brought amazing energy, creativity, and professionalism to the celebration. From custom drinks to flawless service, everything was top-notch. Highly recommend for anyone looking to elevate their event!

They have packages, based on that you chose your favorite alcoholoc drinks. All the brands are well known, and the prices are very competitive. The service that they provide goes above and beyond expectations. All their workers are very professional, they provide entertainment while you are partying, and the mixology was very well done. We had a blast at the wedding.

Our wedding planner recommended Ginger to cater the pool party we hosted for our wedding guests, and we were blown away! They used the kitchen in one of our villas to make the most delicious taco bar from scratch and then served it seamlessly to our guests on the beach! The food was truly incredible - some of the best we had our whole trip. Our guests couldn’t get enough. Their service and detail was outstanding and they cleaned everything up after and were very respectful of our spaces and guests the whole time. We highly recommend their services!
