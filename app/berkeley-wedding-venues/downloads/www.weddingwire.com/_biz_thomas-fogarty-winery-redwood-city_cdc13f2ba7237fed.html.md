Wonderful Wedding!

We had our April wedding at Thomas Fogarty and it was perfect! The views are incredible! I also loved the site for the ceremony on the grass and then the open pavillion for dinner with an inside area for dancing. The staff was also professional, responsive, and very kind. Would highly recommend!

Look no further! You have found your wedding venue

Thomas Fogarty Winery, nestled in the heart of the Bay Area, surpassed all our expectations and created the perfect backdrop for our wedding day. As members of TFW for several years, we had enjoyed many tastings and events at this majestic venue, making it one of our favorite places. The combination of a breathtaking vista, impressive architecture, and a dedicated staff added a unique charm that made our wedding experience truly unforgettable.  
  
What also makes TFW particularly special for us is the personal connection my wife developed with the venue long before we met. Over a decade ago, while still in school, she attended an event at TFW and fell in love with its allure. It became her dream location for the day she would say "I do." Little did I know that she had already coordinated with the management to secure our wedding date by the time I proposed. It was a delightful surprise to discover that we actually both shared the same dream location for our wedding!  
  
The sweeping views of the Bay Area never lose their magic for us, and we were thrilled to share this special place with our guests, many of whom were left speechless by the beauty of the surroundings, having never seen the Bay Area before. Despite the unpredictable weather, the TFW staff, led by Kristin and her event team, demonstrated exceptional professionalism and dedication. When the rolling clouds, rain, and mist complicated our plans, they pivoted with our wedding planner to execute a new strategy, turning challenges into opportunities. The result was a day even more beautiful than we had imagined, with the clouds and mist adding an unexpected charm to the overall atmosphere.  
From the initial planning stages to the execution of the event, Kristin and her team were always available to answer our questions, collaborating seamlessly with our planner. Their attention to detail and commitment to creating a magical atmosphere did not go unnoticed, enhancing our wedding experience.  
  
The venue's aesthetic appeal is a common thread in other positive experiences you'll find online. The picturesque setting is not just a backdrop but an integral part of the overall charm of Thomas Fogarty Winery. And the expansive vineyard provides an intimate and romantic atmosphere for all ceremonies, and the transition to receptions at their pavilion is a seamless continuation of the natural surrounding beauty.  
The added benefit to hosting an event there is the versatility of the venue. Whether indoors or outdoors, TFW allows for easy adjustments if the weather throws you a curveball, as it did for us.  
  
Their commitment to ensuring our happiness was evident in every interaction, instilling confidence at the outset in their ability to coordinate a beautiful event with our numerous vendors.  
  
In retrospect, choosing Thomas Fogarty Winery for our wedding was a decision we will forever cherish. The stunning venue, attentive staff, and overall magical atmosphere combined to create an experience that surpassed our every expectation for our special day. If you're in search of a venue with breathtaking views and a team of dedicated professionals, Thomas Fogarty Winery is undoubtedly a top choice.
