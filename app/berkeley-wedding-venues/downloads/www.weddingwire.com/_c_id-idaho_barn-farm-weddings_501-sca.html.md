Moose Creek Ranch is one of the most gorgeous places I have ever been to. Tony, Jess, and Sophie were the main employees from the venue we worked with, and they were all beyond helpful and accommodating. My husband and I were planning our wedding from Houston, Texas and we had a lot of anxiety about making everything go smoothy. The amazing team at MCR took all that anxiety away and were very helpful from start to finish. I used a lot of information from their website and transferred it to our wedding website which was very helpful for all of our out-of-town guests. I don't even know how to describe how perfect our wedding was and that is due in large part to MCR. We booked the Ranch House for a group of our out-of-town guests, as well as the Rendezvous Cabins 1 & 2\. Our ceremony and reception were both held at MCR. I highly recommend having everything for your big day held at MCR. It was so nice to have most of our guests on site so on the day of the wedding all our people were right there, and it eliminated the worry of travel/timeliness of guest arrivals (plus, extra drinks at the reception knowing nobody was driving...can I get a Halleluiah?) Jess and Sophie were soooo helpful in providing our vendors everything they needed, and they both worked tirelessly to make every detail perfect. When my husband and I showed up WAY before check-in time (we may have been a little excited and read our contract wrong) they were so sweet in getting the rooms turned over and ready for us ASAP. Their willingness to go above and beyond made our day one we will never forget. I walked away from the experience with new friends. One of my favorite things about the ranch were the animals. We had to leave our pups in Houston, and it is one of the only things I would have changed about our wedding day (MCR allows dogs, but it would have been difficult to safely transport our pets to and from). HOWEVER, the ranch has two dogs Yeti and Penny, and they are the sweetest babies ever. Even though my dogs weren’t there it helped an anxious gal like me to have such sweet fur babies around. Everybody wanted to take Penny home. We are already planning a return trip to MCR for next year to enjoy the gorgeous scenery. All of our guests want to go back and spend more time there in the future. If you are planning a wedding in the Jackson Hole area this is your venue. I'm telling you will not regret it.

From the moment we began planning my son's wedding, we knew we were in good hands with Sunflower Lane. As a husband and wife team, they truly excelled in making us feel supported and secure throughout the entire process. Their attention to detail was incredible, ensuring that we had everything we needed right up until the wedding day. No question was too small, and they gracefully guided us through every decision, which eased their nerves and allowed them to enjoy the experience. On the big day, their care and dedication shone even brighter. They were beside us every step of the way, making sure everything went smoothly. What truly amazed us was their willingness to go above and beyond—when we realized we needed a last-minute item, they didn’t hesitate to offer to run to the store for us. Their genuine desire to see us happy was evident, and it made all the difference. If you’re looking for a wedding venue that feels more like family, we wholeheartedly recommend Sunflower Lane. Their professionalism, kindness, and commitment to making our day special are something we will always cherish. Thank you Lesley and Gary for making my son and Daughter-n- law's dream wedding a dream come true!

This place thought of everything! From the little details like the daisies in the stairs, to the waterfall leading to the pond. We are so grateful our daughter’s dream wedding was here. The owners are professional, helpful and respond quickly, even on the day of the wedding. We couldn’t have found a better venue.

From the breathtaking scenery to the stunning barn itself, this venue was absolutely perfect for our wedding. Jen and Tate are incredible to work with – their dedication to their business is evident in the constant improvements we've witnessed over the past few years. They've clearly poured their heart and soul into creating a truly special space. The barn is gorgeous inside and out, exceeding all expectations. On our wedding day, the venue staff were incredibly supportive and helpful, ensuring everything ran smoothly. We couldn't recommend them highly enough! Pro tip: Their preferred vendors were also just as amazing with their knowledge of the venue (if you don't have someone already in mind).

You just can't go wrong with this venue! The barn has been meticulously restored with amenities not often found in a barn setting. It's ADA accessible, has a commercial fridge and ice machine, 3 bathrooms, AC units and more! The kids (and some adults) loved the arcade room. The grounds are just beautiful and well maintained. Even better, your option to work with Reina for your day of coordinator makes everything so easy. She's spectacular!

This is the most beautiful venue you could ask for! It also acquired everything you need for the perfect wedding day from the indoor and outdoor space to plenty of room for all your guest to stay! Booking the whole weekend made it so much easier to set up and get ready, I would highly recommend this gorgeous venue!
