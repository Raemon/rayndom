Diablo Country Club Makes Every Event Unforgettable 

We hosted our 3rd Annual Molly Smiles Foundation Tennis & Pickleball Fundraiser at Diablo Country Club and loved every minute! The venue is gorgeous, the courts and court house are stunning, and the staff are professional, attentive, and so easy to work with. Our guests always have a fantastic time — we highly recommend DCC!

The most beautiful backdrop for my elopement

We celebrated an intimate wedding at Diablo Country Club. They were so helpful from start to finish for every detail. We were worried that we would get less attention as a smaller scale wedding/elopement but this was not at all the case! The staff was amazing & we were so appreciative of the sales team, Jenn & Rylee answered all of our questions up until the very last minute. They even helped us to schedule a separate day on site for pictures. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great venue.
