Elisa was my wedding planner on my destination wedding in Rome. The ceremony and wedding was amazing, beautiful and it exceeded my expectations. Elisa showed us the most amazing venue in Rome and provided the best services along the way. Elisa understood our needs and our vision of the whole party and also really helped us when major problems occurred. I would highly recommend her services

Planning a same-sex wedding overseas is not easy. We did some research online and decided to work with Linda. She was incredible, professional, warm, and kind from day 1. After our first zoom call, we knew we wanted to work with her full-time. Anytime we needed help understanding a situation, Linda always offered a zoom call and worked with us even with a 6 hour time difference. The day of our wedding was perfection. We didn’t have to worry about a thing. All the months of planning really paid off. Linda took care of us and we will forever be grateful for the experience she created for us. Planning a wedding can be overwhelming, but Linda broke down the tasks we needed to do that was digestible. Thank you so much, Linda.

When my husband and I decided to host a party in Italy, I went straight to google to find a good planner - because we live in California, and wanted to work with someone who was fluent in the language. I met with a few different planners, in early summer 2024, and Ilaria, from Italian Event Planners, really stood out to me. She was friendly, personable, and made me feel like she and her team could make our dreams a reality. We decided to move forward with Italian Event Planners because they offered the most customizable planning options and had great communication styles. We exchanged many emails back and forth, as well as phone calls and WhatsApp messages, describing our vision for the event. Ilaria was a great resource in the initial stages of planning - sending us venue options to look at and outlining the various pros and cons of each based on what we wanted. My husband and I decided to make a trip to Italy for vacation and to scope out venues before making any big decisions. We coordinated with IEP to spend a few days in Tuscany touring venues that they had shared with us online. After some travel mishaps, we made it to Tuscany where Ilaria and Annachiara picked us up from the train station and drove us all over Tuscany. We were able to tour about 6 sites. They were the most gracious hostesses - driving us around, treating us to lunch, and building a friendship that will last forever. We found the perfect venue for our party, that quickly turned into 3 events, and then we were off to the races. Booking a band, a photographer, hair & make up, and all of the other details that go along with a big event. The party weekend arrived, and once Ilaria and Annachiara showed up we knew that everything was going to be handled with great care! They were professional, great resources, and handled all of the details so that we could enjoy the weekend with our friends and family - from putting the welcome gifts into the guest rooms, to coordinating the payment of the vendors, to decorating the spaces, to driving us between the events and our room, to stringing bistro lights (or as they call them: “Fairy lights”) over the family style dinner table where we hosted our main event - the list goes on! (They also brought the world’s best fixer, Antonio!) The three days were pure magic, a dream come true that neither of us knew we had dreamt. It was so special, and the event wouldn’t have been so beautiful, run so seamlessly, been such a success without the help of the Italian Event Planners team. I would trust them with any event that I host in the future - Italy or anywhere! Ilaria and Annachiara have become part of our family and look forward to more events in our future!

We cannot praise Vittoria enough for the incredible job she did in creating the most unforgettable wedding experience for us and our guests. From the very first meeting, she understood our vision perfectly and went above and beyond to bring it to life. We wanted a non-traditional wedding that celebrated our mixed Venezuelan and Sardinian heritage while embracing the cultural diversity of our international guests. She effortlessly blended these elements into a seamless and deeply personal celebration that felt unique, authentic, and absolutely magical. Her professional guidance helped us refine our ideas, ensuring every detail was thoughtfully considered and executed to perfection. In the days leading up to the wedding, she managed every aspect of the event with such precision and care that we were able to fully relax and enjoy quality time with our family and friends. Her calm demeanor and meticulous attention to detail ensured that every little hiccup during the wedding day was handled gracefully and without adding any stress to us. We could simply enjoy the moment knowing everything was in the best hands. The result was a breathtaking celebration that our guests are still talking about, filled with warmth, joy, and the perfect balance of traditions and modernity. If you are planning a wedding in Sardinia, we cannot recommend her enough. She is truly a master of her craft, and any couple would be lucky to have her by their side!

On the big day, everything ran seamlessly, allowing us to fully enjoy the moment without worrying about logistics. EIW’s professionalism, creativity, and organization really stood out. We couldn’t have asked for a better team and would highly recommend them to any couple looking for a smooth, beautiful, and memorable wedding experience.

Meeting the MusicalViolino team was fantastic! Extremely skilled and versatile musicians, suitable for any request. Their very convenient package also includes Wedding Planner assistance (they are even three people!) saving quite a bit. We chose the beautiful white piano for the ceremony accompanied by the string quartet, and for the cocktail hour we completely changed it up, taking advantage of Alessandro's saxophone skills. What else can I say: the guests had fun with their Photo Booth taking endless selfies, Alessandro even acted as the vocalist, cheerfully announcing us at dinner and making the guests sing between courses; at the cake cutting he lit up his LED violin and with the cold fountains (I must say really professional and very tall) he captivated everyone; the music for our first dance, always performed with the illuminated violin, was touching and gave us emotions that will always remain in our hearts. The DJ rocked the party together with Alessandro, making us dance from the aperitif, and at the after party he went all out, even bringing out multicolor LED tubes. In conclusion (although I could praise them for much more), our “Wedding day” was better than we could have imagined, prepared by Giusy, Alessandro, and Simone with care and dedication, recommending the best venues, florists, and photographers, without putting any pressure on us, just giving advice, and for us, they are… highly recommended!

I cannot thank Marco enough for everything he did to make our wedding the most amazing and perfect day. He truly went above and beyond in every way! Marco was recommended to me by two colleagues whose destination weddings he planned, and now I know exactly why they spoke so highly of him. I honestly cannot recommend him enough—he is the best wedding planner ever, and he made all of our dreams come true. The entire R&J team and their vendors were phenomenal. From the catering to the ceremony musicians, the DJ, and the florals, every detail was flawless. The photographers, videographer, and hair/makeup artists were amazing and I couldn’t have found these vendors on my own. I was blown away by how beautifully everything turned out. Our guests cannot stop talking about how incredible the day was—many said it felt like a fairytale. And it truly was. Marco also helped us stay within our budget while still securing amazing vendors, and while there are always some compromises to make to stay within the budget, I felt like we had to compromise very little. And Marco was able to help us In the end, we got everything we wanted and more. He organized absolutely everything from connecting us with the most amazing vendors, organizing our pre-wedding trip to Italy to see our venue and have our food tasting (which was AMAZING), and answering the thousands of questions I had :) Thank you so much to Marco and the entire team. If you’re looking for a wedding planner who will support you through every step of the process and create the most magical experience—look no further!

We had the pleasure of working with Teresa and Corinna for our wedding in Italy, and we couldn’t have asked for a better team. From our very first meeting, they were both so warm and pleasant, immediately putting us at ease. It was clear from the start that they were highly experienced and knowledgeable, which gave us such confidence throughout the planning process. Despite having a relatively short planning timeline (and plenty of demands from our side!), they were always happy to jump on calls, meet with us, and patiently talk through every detail. They were incredibly responsive and proactive in following up on queries, helping us refine ideas, and ultimately bringing our Tuscan wedding vision to life. Even when we faced some last-minute worries about the weather, they handled everything calmly and efficiently, ensuring the day went smoothly. We truly appreciated their dedication, professionalism, and care. Beyond their skill and organisation, Teresa and Corinna are simply lovely people — warm, genuine, and a joy to work with. We’re so grateful for everything they did to make our wedding such a beautiful and memorable experience. Highly recommended!

We had a PERFECT wedding because of Neve. We are so grateful to her and her team. We had a wedding of 70 people that involved certain logistics because my parents are disabled. Neve arranged all the transportation for them from start to finish (and even a bus to get to the planned cruise after!). She is very detail oriented and we really appreciated her honesty on what we should/shouldn't do. Planning a destination wedding in Italy from New Jersey was much less stressful with Neve. On the day of, she came to our hotel when we were getting ready to make sure we were running on schedule. She even called the hotel several times when our lunch room service was running late. We can't thank her enough for a fantastic, perfect day that we and our loved ones had :) Everyone was saying how great she was and I highly recommend her to plan your Tuscany wedding!
