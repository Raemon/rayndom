Jefferson Street Mansion by Wedgewood Weddings is a beautiful vintage venue located in the historic area of Benicia, California. Overlooking the stunning Carquinez Strait, this neoclassical-style mansion is nestled in the heart of the Bay Area. Replete with nostalgic decor and authentic period pieces, the mansion boasts a timeless charm. Couples who choose to wed here are sure to be impressed by its myriad of romantic settings and inviting ambiance. Their seasoned staff is committed to maintaining the venue’s tradition of hospitality and will strive to bring your vision to life in this elegant getaway.

Jefferson Street Mansion stands proud as part of Historic Benicia's Arsenal as it was once the Executive Officer's Quarters. Built in 1861, the East Coast architects found inspiration in French military heroes such as Napolean and American Revolution General Lafayette and incorporated many elements of the Empire style of design. Once the US Military of the Arsenal was decommissioned in 1960, the mansion moved into private ownership. In 1998, it was purchased by its current owner and restored to its former glory, specifically to be a beautiful setting for special events.

**Facilities and Capacity**

Jefferson Street Mansion by Wedgewood Weddings can accommodate up to 200 guests for an outdoor ceremony. Enjoy water views of the Bay, manicured landscaping, and immaculate vintage styling throughout the venue. You can also make use of the tented pavilion with twinkle lit trees to host a reception.

**Services Offered**

Enjoy full-service event planning with four different package options for every price point: Build-your-own, Classic, Premier & Elite. The dedicated Wedgewood Weddings team is happy to work with all couples to customize any package.

Be sure to check out the gallery for an exclusive 360° Virtual Tour!

Wedding planning

We had the absolute best experience working with the team at Jefferson Street Mansion! From start to finish, they went above and beyond to make our wedding day unforgettable. Kaitlin, our day-of coordinator, is an absolute joy to work with! She was incredible—organized, professional, and so patient with our guests, families, and my husband and me. She took the stress off our shoulders and made sure every detail ran smoothly, all while having a smile on her face.   
  
We had a blast at each of our meetings and we credit that to the wonderful ladies of Jefferson, Kathy and Sophia. Their joyful personalities made the planning process so much more enjoyable, and their great communication helped us feel at ease the entire way through. They truly listened to our vision and brought it to life even better than we imagined.  
  
Thanks to Kaitlin, Sophia, and Kathy, our wedding day was seamless, beautiful, and full of joy. We can’t thank them enough for their professionalism, patience, and dedication. Highly recommend this amazing team to any couple looking for coordinators who will not only execute your dream day but also make the process fun and stress-free!

Dream wedding

We had been price comparing different venues prior and were feeling defeated before we came across Jefferson St. Mansion. Based on my sister-in-law’s recommendation and the prices posted online, it looked promising.   
  
It was love at first sight as we toured the space and it was perfect for our intimate 65 guest wedding. This was the first and only venue we visited. We were confident it was the one and we put down our deposit that evening. They had the date we wanted, the venue was STUNNING and pricing was reasonable especially with everything that was included. An all inclusive venue which included catering, florals, tables, chairs, Dj, open bar, cake, wedding planning and day of coordinator. You’re able to customize your package to your liking. You can upgrade certain aspects of the package or take out things to cut costs. Aside from their in-house catering, if you have a specific bakery, florists, Dj or any other outside vendor you would like to hire you’re able to do so.  
  
Prior to the wedding, they invite their engaged couples to a cute wedding fair event where you can sample the menu, drinks, the bakery, see examples of floral arrangements and table settings, get a feel for the Dj and get acquainted with the vendors.   
  
We felt relatively stress free when it came to the planning process. The mansion provides you with a handy planning binder with timelines and vendor info. There were two in-person meetings and the planning team was there via text or email for any questions, concerns or changes.  
  
The execution of the wedding was flawless and went off without a hitch. Our guests raved about the venue, food and ambiance . We had many guests say it was one of the most beautiful weddings they’ve been to which is a testament to how amazing and hard-working the team is. This is also coming from an type A personality, who is very picky. Overall, we were well take care of throughout the process and would recommend them to anyone. Jefferson St. Mansion truly made our dream wedding a reality.

We love JSM & Wedgewood!

We knew we wanted to have this venue as soon as we did a tour, based on looks alone! Wedgewood made the planning process so easy since we were able to customize our package & we ended up selecting all of the preferred vendors, since they know the venue best. Day of our wedding, we just had to show up & have a great time to soak everything in. Especially after the planning meetings with the venue, we had timeline all worked out & the team took care of us -- shoutout to Maricela, Taylor & Demika for alletting us know where to be & making sure we had everything we needed!

Incredible venue

Get married here!  
  
The staff at Jefferson Street Mansion are so reliable, so good at their jobs, so fun, and so kind. Maricela and Demika went way above and beyond our expectations.  
  
Maricela in particular took care of us over months of planning, emails, phone calls, and meetings. She was always organized, responsive, and kind. As we got closer to the wedding, it really seemed like she cared about us and our special day.  
  
Demika was our banquet captain on the day of the wedding. She took care of our every need, built us up, and joined the party.  
  
If you get married at a Wedgewood venue, you'll benefit from an extremely well-designed and well-organized system of planners, facilities, coordinators, and relationships with preferred vendors. It made my wife and my experience so much easier than it otherwise could have been.  
  
Jefferson Street Mansion is beautiful and delightful. If you live in the Bay, it feels both local and like an escape.  
  
We loved everything about the experience.

AMAZING WEDDING VENDOR that will let you live your regular life while planning a once-in-a-lifetime event! 

I got married here this year in September 4th!!! I LOVE Wedgewood Weddings due to their all inclusive packages. It really saved me a lot of time so I could focus on myself. The coordinators there were ALL wonderful. I had such a great experience with Nicole Sullivan, Cherilynn, Laura, Melissa, Mariana, Kirsten because I interfaced with them at least once with my 2103498234 questions (even the day before the wedding). They were all very attentive and even reached out to other vendors when I panicked that I was not getting a response. They made things work and they never left me hanging (which is a big deal for someone who is planning a huge event like this-hopefully a once in a lifetime event). I would choose Jefferson Street Mansion in a heartbeat!

Amazing Venue, Amazing Team!

For starters, the team was awesome. We got to work with Mariana and Selena ( I think I have the names right 😅). They were so kind and very nice to talk to😊 I was nervous before but after the first appointment they made it so easy! Not only were they very professional but they were flexible! We had a lot of last minute changes but despite any of that they put together such a beautiful wedding and all we had to do was sit back and pick what we wanted !!😂 Stress-free!!! 10/10 recommended and the food was bomb!! We got the elite package with the prime rib. Trust me. So worth it!!!!!🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 Thankyou wedgewood☺️😊

12/11/20 outdoor wedding

Thank you to all the staff for accommodating us! They were so friendly and devoted to making our day special. Everything was incredible and set up as we asked. The mansion is so beautiful and unique. It was the perfect scenery to take photos. Our family and friends had such a good time at our reception. My husband and I were very fortunate to have our event at Jefferson during a time we thought wouldn’t be possible. We loved our experience with Wedgewood Weddings and highly recommend them!

10/19/19 wedding

The staff of Jefferson Street Mansion handled our wedding with as much care and attention to detail as if it had been their own wedding (especially helpful to my husband and I, who needed support in considering all possible details at this level). Our wedding and reception were magical and two months later, friends and family still go out of their way to agree. Thank you!
