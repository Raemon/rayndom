Choosing to get married at Woodland Weddings is one of the best decisions we’ve ever made! From the very beginning, the owners Kelsey and Greg were absolutely amazing!! They are SO kind and willing to do anything they can to help make your vision come to life! We really appreciated how much we were able to customize and the abundance of decor that is included with your rental. As beautiful as this place looks in photos, it’s even better in person. There’s no other venue like this, it’s truly magical!

We had an amazing experience having our wedding at Off Map. We booked out the venue and had all of our friends stay in the on-site accommodations (beautiful glamping tents) and everyone loved it (and it even rained)! The staff was kind and helpful, while also giving us our space to be with our loved ones.

We stayed at Boyne Mountain, along with many of our guests, for our wedding weekend in August 2023. We were impressed start to finish! We felt like royalty when we got glasses of champagne at check-in. Our room was very comfortable - jacuzzi tub, view of the mountain, and fluffy robes for us to wear! Spa day for the bridal party was a big success - the spa staff was so accommodating to our last minute schedule adjustments, and it was the most quality pedicure I’ve ever had! Front desk staff was very helpful in ensuring that our welcome bags ended up with our guests. We had delicious meals at Everett’s, and had a great time at the Snowflake Lounge too! We will be back :)

Our wedding at Camp Pinewood was everything we hoped for and more. The venue is absolutely stunning, and the staff were all friendly and helpful. Our guests had so much fun with the activities, and I know our more introverted guests really enjoyed being able to escape outside and enjoy the trails when the party got going in the lodge. We loved having so much space and so many fun things to do. We highly recommend camp pinewood to anyone looking for a highly unique, fun, outdoorsy wedding!

My wife and I are so glad we booked our wedding and reception at the Schoolhouse! It has a great set up for small to moderate sized wedding parties! The pay it forward closet is one of its most surprising features! We used many decorations, flowers, etc! It all worked so well together and helped us save money! Sarah and her staff are all so helpful and accommodating and they have an extensive list of vendors they have worked with that we used to create our best wedding day! They’re not “preferred” or “have to use” vendors - but ones that have been to the schoolhouse before - and the couples have been happy with. This allowed us to have the perfect day. Everyone worked perfectly together. Located close to I-196 and Chicago Drive it is a great location. We are so beyond happy this was our venue!

I have only good things to say about Belle Isle as a wedding venue! We had our ceremony outside at the Conservatory botanical gardens in September. It took place after closing, so we had the whole building to ourselves and our guests. On top of it being a beautiful venue the grounds keepers were very accommodating and helpful. We followed that with a reception at the Flynn Pavillion. This turned out to be an awesome space for our 100+ guests. It was intimate and once decorated it was very unique and beautiful space. The renovations they've done were great and in the future I'm sure it will be even more so. The staff at Belle Isle were excellent and had no issues working with them. They were very professional and answered any questions we had in a timely manner. The park rangers were also very prompt and helpful. Other than that I cant argue about the value of holding an event here. It was very affordable and we could spend our money on other important things for our wedding. I highly recommend Belle Isle.

Taylor and Mary are both super easy to work with and help handle all the planning for the ceremony. It took a huge weight off my shoulders knowing it was handled and they wouldn't let anything slip through the cracks and allowed me to focus on the reception planning. The indoor chapel is really elegant, but we had an outdoor ceremony and it was BEAUTIFUL. Highly recommend. They were also able to give us several references for other wedding vendors which really helped with planning.
