We just got married on Nov 1st and the day/night was absolutely seamless thanks to RS Event Co. Everything went perfectly and it was truly one of the most wonderful days of my life. When I first started planning our wedding I didn’t think I would need a day-of wedding coordinator- until the months got closer and I realized how much work would actually go into making the day flow the way I envisioned it. We had heard of Raquel through a family friend, so I decided to give her a call. Raquel was personable, proactive and thought of everything I never even thought to consider. She helped us maneuver the months leading to our special day, checking in often and answering every random text. Whatever hiccups there might have been the day-of my husband and I didn’t notice because she was on top of even the smallest detail. We adored working with Raquel and her team. Our wedding was an absolute blast, which I owe to RS Event Co ensuring our vision was exactly what we wanted it to be. My only regret is not calling her sooner!!!!!!

Working with Caitlin Metzaros of Two Vows was one of the best decisions I made for my wedding (30 August 2025). I hired Caitlin as a partial planner because I knew I wanted to stay very involved and maintain a lot of control over the planning process. From day one, she was completely supportive of that. She made it clear that she was happy to help as much or as little as I wanted, and she truly let me steer every decision while still being an incredible guide and resource. Our monthly meetings kept everything on track and surprisingly low-stress. Outside of those check-ins, Caitlin was always available. If an urgent question or issue came up, she was easy to reach, quick to respond, and always willing to jump on a call or respond to a text, no matter how small the concern. Her knowledge of the wedding planning process and her strong vendor network were invaluable. Her recommendations truly brought our vision to life. For example, we booked a florist she suggested, and the florals were absolutely stunning—far beyond what I had imagined. When the wedding week arrived, Caitlin was completely attentive, organized, and on top of every detail. Our wedding was not only beautiful but felt seamless from start to finish. She did an amazing job coordinating both the rehearsal dinner and the entire wedding day. I gave Caitlin several examples and inspiration photos for the décor, and she nailed it. As a very particular person with a clear vision, I sometimes worried I was being overly specific—but Caitlin never made me feel that way. Instead, she embraced my vision, made thoughtful suggestions, and then executed everything flawlessly. If anything did go wrong during the wedding, I had absolutely no idea, because Caitlin handled it quietly and efficiently behind the scenes. I was able to be fully present and enjoy the day, knowing she had everything under control. I truly could not have asked for a better wedding planner. Caitlin is professional, responsive, organized, creative, and incredibly kind. I wholeheartedly recommend Two Vows and Caitlin to any couple looking for someone they can trust with one of the most important days of their lives.

Jess is the best of the best! We had a Catholic ceremony at a small church that I grew up going to, with our reception to follow at The Riverhouse. I knew with so many moving parts it would be really helpful to have someone’s expertise and organization to assist us. That’s when we found JHevents, and all I can say is wow! From my first interaction with Jessica, I knew she would be the perfect addition to our day. Her calm composure, friendliness, attention to detail and kindness made all the difference not to mention all that they do! We hired Jess as our month of coordinator and we could not have been more thrilled that we did. While we were traveling to Connecticut from Michigan just days before our wedding, Jess was working hard on confirming all details with our vendors, tying the lose ends on our timeline, and truly making us feel like everything was under control. And then on the day of we got to enjoy every second! Everything was taken care of from set up to break down at the venue so we did not have to worry or stress about a thing. It went absolutely perfectly all thanks to Jess and her team. If you are looking for someone to help ease your mind, help carry out your vision, and make your wedding dreams come true, look no further and get JHevents on your vendor team!

We are so happy that we chose to work with Christine & John from Soiree as our wedding planner and designer. They are a great team. Throughout the entire planning process, they provided individual attention, were always available to answer questions, and made sure we were organized while guiding and offering us their expert advice. They listened to our vision and preferences and with creativity, professionalism, and attention to detail created a personalized and stunning design that matched our style. All the necessary logistics and coordination with various vendors and the venue were handled to make the day run smoothly and according to plan. Christine & John are not only professional and experienced, but also friendly and fun to work with. They went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect, and we couldn't be happier with the result! Our guests were blown away by the beautiful design and the seamless flow of the event. They are truly talented and passionate about they do, and it shows! We highly recommend Soiree to anyone looking to make their wedding day unforgettable.

Mary, Julie, and Kim exceeded every expectation when planning and executing my wedding. I’ve heard from many guests that it was the best wedding they had ever been to. I wasn’t the easiest client, often changing my mind and struggling to share the vision in my head. Mary just understood what I gave her, understood the venue space and knew what to do to make my vision happen. I even miscalculated the number of boutonnières needed, leaving us one short — and I didn’t find out until the next day. Mary and her team had made one out of her own supplies and extra flowers, and no one could tell. I couldn’t imagine a better end result—if you want to have the perfect wedding (where you don’t know about the inevitable mishaps that occur) then you need a Mother of the Bride wedding planner!

We had an exceptional experience working with Victoria and Everlasting Affairs and cannot recommend them highly enough. From the very beginning, Victoria was warm, personable, and genuinely invested in bringing our dream wedding to life. She supported us for over a year, guiding us through every phase of the planning process and communicating seamlessly via email, video calls, phone, and text. She was consistently responsive and flexible in adapting to our preferred communication style. For every aspect of the wedding, from venues and invitations to the band, photographer, makeup artist, and countless other detailed decisions, Victoria provided curated lists of trusted, vetted vendors. She handled communication with all of our vendors, arranged introduction calls, and was always present to ensure everything stayed on track. Victoria also created detailed timelines outlining vendor decision deadlines and day-of schedules. Her organization and efficiency were invaluable, and the online planning portal made even daunting tasks, like seating charts, feel manageable and stress-free. On the wedding day itself, Victoria was by my side every step of the way, taking care of every detail and ensuring everything ran smoothly. We couldn’t be happier with our experience and wholeheartedly recommend Everlasting Affairs to anyone planning their wedding.

DJ Manu and Marx Entertainment were phenomenal! My husband and I hired them for our wedding and they created the perfect entertainment experience for us. Both in the weeks leading up to the event, and on the day itself, DJ Manu was so incredibly kind, communicative, and flexible. Our venue had multiple rooms, but he was well-prepared and had speaker/mic set-ups for the ceremony, dinner, and dancing. He checked in with us throughout the night and made sure we were all on the same page as we moved into each part of the wedding. And most importantly, the music was incredible. The dance floor was never empty and we received so many compliments on the playlist. People of all ages were out there dancing and having a great time. DJ Manu really knew how to read the room, hype people up, and create an unforgettable experience. I cannot recommend him enough!

She is very consistent and detail oriented, she is a great listener and always goes beyond with her ideas and creativity. She is very passionate, yet professional. Marina and her team definitely made our special day a very memorable one and we will cherish the memories forever. I would highly recommend her.
