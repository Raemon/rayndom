Jay is the best!

We feel so lucky to have found such a cool, down to earth DJ. He worked with us closely to understand our vibe and stayed true to what we wanted. He knows how to read the room / change up the pace to keep the dance floor going strong. He also helped us with the music/mic for our ceremony in the forest. He can really do it all. 10/10!!!

Dj jay is the best!

We loved DJ Jay and had the best music at our wedding! He is a joy to work with and brings the dance party! A true professional in the time leading up to the wedding and then a total blast day-of! Not cheesy emcee-ish-- just the right vibes. We loved him and 10/10 would recommend!!

Best DJ for sure

We found Jay through our venue and from the beginning we loved his communication, how through he was with questions and suggestions and he made our wedding day so wonderful. He was flexible with our mix of Brazilian and Romanian music requests, our starwars incorporation and most of all his flexibility when rain started pouring. Our guests absolutely loved his dj skills during cocktail and especially during dancing. He is DEF NOT those cheesy awkward djs and recommend him to whoever wants an amazing dj for their wedding or event.

The best dj we could have ever asked for

I can't say enough wonderful things about Jay and his team. We were initially supposed to work with JD Gluckstern from Jay's team who is a dream - extremely communicative, got our vision perfectly, and was ready to play the best dance DJ set of all time for our wedding. JD was so easy to talk to and work with we knew we were in good hands. Unfortunately, JD had an issue arise the week of our wedding preventing him from being able to make it and handled it in the most professional way ever - he sent us an extremely heartfelt message apologizing profusely about not being able to play for us, and had a solution already - Jay would be our DJ instead. We were upset to not work with JD who saw our vision so clearly, but it was apparent after 1 call with Jay that he would be exactly the same and deliver for us on our wedding day.  
  
He did not only deliver, Jay went above and beyond - he had everyone on the dance floor the entire night DRENCHED in sweat. We were told by everyone we spoke to that it was the most they ever danced at a wedding. He arrived early to set up and get everything together and truly made it feel like a night out partying as opposed to the same old wedding music you hear at every wedding.   
  
For our after-party, we wanted to keep the dancing going, but with the switch of locations our people needed to be eased back into it. Jay found the perfect song selection to get everyone back in the mood, one by one getting everyone back on the dance floor without having to say a thing over the microphone, and in no time the dance floor was packed again.   
  
I cannot say enough good things about this team. Not only did they make us feel calm and heard for our wedding, the songs Jay played (and we know JD would have too!!!) had everyone from our grandparents to our friends to our young cousins on the dance floor the entire night. You will be so happy you booked them!!!!

Best DJ ever

Jay is hands down the best DJ! He was very pleasant to collaborate with leading up to the wedding––he was organized, took the time to understand our music preferences, and shared his expertise along the way. Most importantly, he kept the dance floor going all night and our guests are still talking about how stellar he was. Our European guests were especially impressed by how he got everyone on the dance floor from the get-go (as dancing typically starts later in Europe) until the very end. We also received compliments from our older guests on how he smoothly mixed older songs with newer ones––even our 90-year old grandma from Ecuador was dancing. We even saw family and friends who typically never put a foot on the dance floor dance. Jay did a stellar job of mixing our favorite songs with other songs that pleased the crowd, and handled (unexpected) incoming requests from guests with such ease. (He would not play any songs that did not fit within our guidelines without having the guest obtain our approval first, which we highly appreciated.)  
  
We had a sparkler moment leading up to a bonfire and were worried that people would not make it back to the dance floor after grabbing a s’more. Jay is so talented that some people never made it to the bonfire and others (including me) ran (yes, we ran!) back to the dance floor because the music was so good.   
  
We HIGHLY, STRONGLY, FULLY recommend Jay for any wedding or party, and hope that our paths will cross again in the future.

The Absolute Best! 

There are not enough words to describe how awesome Jay McElfresh is. He is simply the best. The music was the most important part of the wedding to me, and working with Jay melted my worries away. Every discussion we had with Jay felt like catching up with a friend who was equally excited about the wedding. He read the room beautifully and was able to seamlessly weave together a playlist of our favorite songs, some oldie but goodies, and some more modern hits - the dancefloor was packed all night. Also, little did I know, Jay was in on a surprise my (now) husband had planned - a musical cue timed *perfectly* near the end of his vows. It stole the show!

Best Wedding DJ!

I attended my brother's wedding a few years ago and Jay was the DJ. He kept guests on the dancefloor the entire night and kept MCing to a minimum which I really enjoyed. When I got engaged and started planning my own wedding I knew exactly who to hire for the job. Jay was responsive, professional, and fun to work with. The music worksheet was extremely helpful in our planning process as well as the final call before the big day. Just as Jay kept the party going years ago at my brother's wedding, he did the same at ours. Look no further if you want a quality DJ to host your big day! Thanks for everything, Jay! -Andrea & Greg Fullum

Jay crushed wedding weekend!

Could not recommend Jay enough! Our guests could NOT stop raving about the music. Jay kept a NON-STOP dance party going and it seriously flew by so quickly. All night long, everyone from our college friends and the older aunties kept coming up to me, commenting on how great the music was. It truly appealed to guests of all ages.

Jay killed it

Jay came through our wedding with an awesome set up and great tunes that really set the vibe for the whole night. Music killed throughout and the dance floor was poppin' all night long - great job at sneaking in some bride/groom requested gems and keeping the dance floor going all night. Awesome guy.

Jay and I recently worked together at a wedding at Current in Manhattan. Jay was an absolute pleasure - he emceed the evening wonderfully and had guests smiling and dancing all night. He looked sharp, professional and stylish (as a great DJ should) and he played songs that really made the night memorable - not just the same old wedding soundtrack! I look forward to working with Jay again!
