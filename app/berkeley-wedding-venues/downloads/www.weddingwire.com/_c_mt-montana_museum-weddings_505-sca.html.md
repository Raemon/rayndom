After my husband proposed to me we knew that we wanted to have a wedding in an area that had never been used before. We are both history buffs and love everything BUTTE! While talking with Jeanette one day, we decided that we wanted a true Butte wedding. We thought about having the wedding under the Orphan Girl. After thinking about it we decided to have the wedding 100ft below the base of of headframe in the 100ft level of the Orphan Girl Mine. This idea was met with excitement and support, the planning started that day. The day of our wedding came and there was so much rain...We had flash flood warnings and hail. Thank god we were having our ceremony Underground! The sun came out right before we went into the portal and allowed us my favorite family picture, with hard hats and all! Our ceremony was amazing! It was a cozy ceremony that included our immediate family members. Everyone loved the idea! We all wore hard hats and our family members got to experience this once in a lifetime opportunity with us! Jeanette officiated the ceremony which allowed us to completely customize everything about it. We also took all of our wedding pictures at Hell Roaring Gulch and on/under the Orphan Girl Headframe. After the wedding we had our reception in the hoist house! Our awesome cook made the most amazing tacos and and we had enough room for our friends to come join the dinner. It was so cool to be surrounded by the hoist house equipment and give everyone an experience that they would never forget. My husband and I were the first to have our wedding at the 100ft level of the Orphan Girl Mine and we encourage you to think of the World Museum of Mining when you are thinking of planning your special day.
