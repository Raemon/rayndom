Bittersweet is an absolutely stunning venue, and our entire wedding experience there was seamless from the start. We planned our wedding in just four months, and both the planning process and the day itself were smooth, beautiful, and completely stress-free. Our private ceremony in the loft and our reception on the main floor felt effortless, and a huge part of that was thanks to our incredible day-of coordinator, Alexis. She was organized, calm, and genuinely invested in making sure every detail reflected exactly what we envisioned. The whole night unfolded beautifully, and she’ll always hold a special place with us for helping create a wedding day we’ll never forget. Thank you to Alexis and the entire Bittersweet team for making our day truly unforgettable.

We had an amazing experience working with Christina & the team at RMC to put on our dream wedding at Cove Cabin at Mount Hope Farm. They were so easy, friendly & professional to work with, which led to a picture perfect & stress-free wedding day!

Our wedding was perfection start to finish! Of course it rained during our first look and even then it didn’t dampen our spirits! It just blessed us!! Our first look in their gardens was special with lots of tears and awe moments! Highly recommend! As for the first look with my dad, it was closer to the bridal suite right under the big tree, and more tears and lots of hugs! Then we all went into the bridal suite, to gather before we had our ceremony in the big red barn. Our wedding was rustic and country, simple yet formal. It was filled with lots of love, family and happiness! It was intimate and perfect in every way! They kept us to the timeline and didn’t make us feel rushed. They made sure we drank fluids (water and wine/beer) as well as eating our food first so we could mingle with our guests. Patricia and our DJ Jason Mello have teamwork down pat! They made our wedding absolutely perfect!!! I can’t thank Chamberlain’s enough for being absolutely perfect in every way!!! From organizing, to my endless emails of can we do this? But also just helping me make our day perfect!!! I was so worried about something ruining our day, when it just couldn’t have been more perfect! When people come up to tell you it was the best bedding they have ever been to! It’s quite the compliment!!! When your new husband finally knows what you have been stressing about for the last 1.5 years and tells you it’s perfect in every way…..you can finally relax, because you had a lot of great help to get your day perfect and their names are Patricia and Jacqui!!! Thank you so very much!!! Love always, Robyn and Jeffery Ricardo

Jessica and the sweet berry farm team are so wonderful! From the first reach out, she was super responsive. We immediately scheduled an onsite tour where she met us and told us all the in's and outs of the venue and what to expect. She checked in throughout the months leading up to the wedding and facilitated communication with our vendors. The day of she was there to greet us all and help with vendor clean up as well. It was such a joy to work with the team!

Our wedding weekend in Newport was held back in July and included three events: a welcome drinks event at one of the Bowen's Wharf restaurants Friday evening, a Polo Party on Saturday July 22nd against Ireland, and the actual wedding at Castle Hill on Sunday. While everyone enjoyed the welcome drinks, and loved our wedding event, the Polo Party is the event that our friends most frequently talk about. Everyone is asking to come back to Newport this summer to partake in the outdoor fun! Hosting a pre-wedding polo party was the perfect way to have a memorable and unique event for all ages. We would highly recommend this to anyone getting married in Newport!

I had my wedding here in August & I cannot begin to recommend wrights and their entire team for any occasion!! I was so worried about how my wedding would come out, and their coordinator Roger made sure I felt and was in incredIble hands! They truly made the wedding of my dreams, not to mention at an unbelievably affordable cost!! It was more than I could have ever asked for!

We toured Tamarack before booking another venue, this was our runner up venue. We loved it! We will definitely host an event here in the future!
