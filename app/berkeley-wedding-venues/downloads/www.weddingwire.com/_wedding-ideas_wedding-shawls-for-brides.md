Wedding shawls come in handy for a lot of reasons. They provide shoulder coverage, warmth when the temperature drops, and if nothing else, they're a super easy way to accessorize your dress and change up your style with almost zero effort. These days, a bridal shawl is especially useful if you've had to [postpone your wedding](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-postpone-your-wedding) or split the celebration across multiple days—you can use a shawl to transition your wedding dress to a different season or create multiple looks if you're wearing your dress more than once. The best part? You can find shawls at all price points, which means you don't have to break the bank to look chic. Check out our hand-picked options you can buy online right now. 

## Shop these wedding shawls for an easy way to accessorize your gown on any budget. 

A silk pashmina goes with any style of wedding dress. If you prefer a truer white, this one also comes in ivory.

**BHLDN** Rue semi-sheer raw-edge pashmina wrap in Neutral, $48, [Anthropologie](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=39789&u1=WWeditorial&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropologie.com%2Fshop%2Fbhldn-rue-pashmina-wrap4)

Need something blue for your wedding day? Accessorize with a delicate light blue shawl to add a bit of color to your bridal ensemble. This lightweight style is perfect for cool summer evenings.

**Cosy Llama** wedding shawl in Silver Blue, $150, [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1525208988/wedding-shawl-silver-blue-bridal-shawl)

For a sophisticated look, a basic chiffon wrap is really all you need. This affordable wedding shawl comes in eight colors—you can choose from versatile neutrals or pretty much any other color you love. 

**Quince** featherweight cashmere silk frayed edge scarf in Ivory, $60, [Quince](https://www.quince.com/women/cashmere-silk-fringed-scarf)

This super-soft bridal shawl is knit from baby alpaca wool—that means new-growth wool from adult alpacas, not actual baby alpacas!—for warm but breathable coverage. The wrap is finished with playful pom-poms, comes in 5 different colors, and can be personalized with your monogram. Trust us when we say you'll want to re-wear it all the time after the wedding day.

**Sh*t That I Knit** The After Pardy Wrap in Camel, $195, [Sh*t That I Knit](https://shitthatiknit.com/products/the-after-pardy-wrap)

We love a good dose of shimmer, especially for your bridal look. Accessorize with a metallic gold wedding shawl to instantly glam up your outfit. This shimmery wrap also comes in black, navy blue, and pink. 

**Nordstrom** shimmer wrap in Tan Desert Shimmer, $39, [Nordstrom](https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/nordstrom-shimmer-wrap/4955230)

If you're feeling sassy, a feathered shrug or shawl is always a fun way to accessorize your wedding dress. This ostrich feather shrug is available in bridal white or pretty blush. 

**Bubish** Berlin bolero in White, $399, [REVOLVE](https://www.revolve.com/bubish-berlin-bolero-in-white/dp/BUBR-WO47/)

Wear a tulle off-the-shoulder wrap to bring vintage vibes to your wedding day attire. This accessory is a great way to add more coverage to a strapless dress. 

**Velo Bianco** off the shoulder pearl bridal shawl, $86, [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1460409991/off-the-shoulder-pearl-bridal-shawl)

This sheer silver wrap is a classy option for more formal dress codes. The ruffled hem makes it feel slightly more elevated than your average wedding shawl. 

**I.N.C. International Concepts** ruffle-edge metallic evening wrap in Silver, $43, [Macy's](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/i.n.c.-international-concepts-ruffle-edge-metallic-evening-wrap-created-for-macys?ID=5729634)

Throw on this cozy and warm wrap if you're wearing a sleeveless or strapless wedding dress. If there's ever a time to splurge on cashmere, it's your wedding day! 

**MERSEA** The Luxy Wrap in Turtledove, $228, [MERSEA](https://mersea.com/products/the-cashmere-luxy-wrap)

Going for a boho look? Accessorize with a floral embroidered cape to transform your wedding dress without adding too much coverage. 

**Amsale** floral embroidered cape, $550, [Amsale](https://amsale.com/products/r421cp-ivory)

Plaid is an ever-popular choice for rustic and fall weddings. We like this burgundy and pink colorway, which is more versatile year-round compared to red or green plaids. 

**Fall And Hope** blanket scarf, $24, [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1327348833/pink-beige-blanket-scarf-blanket-scarf)

A simplistic white capelet is a chic way to accessorize your gown, no matter the season or venue. Try a hand-knit style made of silk and mohair for maximum softness. 

**Gabriela Faur** winter wedding shawl, from $96, [Etsy](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=565019&awinmid=6220&clickref=WWeditorial&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F476531006%2Fwedding-shawl-bridal-shawl-bridal)

This monogrammed wedding shawl is a simple way to switch up your look, but it also makes a great bridesmaid gift. Choose from black, white, navy blue, or gray. 

**WeddingWire Shop** personalized pashmina scarf, $28, [WeddingWire Shop](https://www.weddingwireshop.com/product/womens-print-personalized-pashmina-scarf-script-monogram?utm_source=weddingwire&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=wedding-shawls-for-brides&utm_campaign=wweditorial)

Glitzy rows of pearls make this tulle cape a no-brainer for formal occasions (or a _Gatsby_ theme). If your wedding dress is fairly simple, it's an easy way to add a hint of glam. 

**The Affordable Bridal Dress** bridal tulle cape, $187, [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1495809105/bridal-tulle-cape-full-lenght-with-rows)

If you need a way to stay warm in cooler temps, this elegant wedding shawl will do the trick. Customize your order by choosing from more than 50 yarn colors and ribbons to match your dress. 

**Moda Crochet** bridal shawl, from $89, [Etsy](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=565019&awinmid=6220&clickref=WWeditorial&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F91191643%2Fbridal-shawl-wedding-bolero-bridal-cape)

This 100% silk wrap will become a wardrobe staple even after your wedding day. The ivory is a classic choice, but it also comes in black, navy blue, and grey. 

**Nordstrom** satin border silk chiffon wrap in Ivory Vanilla, $79, [Nordstrom](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/nordstrom-satin-border-silk-chiffon-scarf/4645991)

The fur trend isn't going away anytime soon. This regal off-the-shoulder wrap, which is also available in white, is gorgeous for a winter wedding. 

**E.S. Wedding** bridal faux fur shawl, $60, [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1376613485/bridal-shawl-bridal-wrap-faux-fur-shrug)
