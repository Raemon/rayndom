Paulette was the absolute perfect wedding planner from beginning to end. So much so that I am the second member of my family to use her because we trust her so incredibly with the most special day of our lives. From the very first meeting, Paulette took my vision, my needs, my budget, and my families needs and understand them implicitly. A Christmas, beautiful, FUN, elegant, expensive looking wedding she was able to deliver with what seemed like no stress on her part. Also, with very little stress on my part as she always made sure I was feeling okay and provided answers to questions before I even had to ask or worry about them. I asked for a grand wedding that none of our guests would forget, and I got that and so much more thanks to her. As I got married at Lyford Cay, Paulette made the most beautiful place in the world shine even brighter. I would recommend her 100 times over.

A wedding planner and day-of coordinator is one of the most valuable investments you can make for your wedding - and we are so grateful to have had the amazing Anne Marie Williams (Weddings in the Bahamas) as ours! As we are based in Australia, we were nervous about planning our destination wedding in Nassau. However, Anne Marie made the process so much easier and helped us achieve a wedding day that was absolutely magical. In the many months leading up to our wedding, Anne Marie connected us with great vendors, helped us coordinate with them and worked with us to plan our day down to every last detail. She was always open to and supportive of our ideas, always welcomed our questions, and provided great guidance if we were ever unsure. The wedding day itself also unfolded so smoothly. Anne Marie was onsite throughout the entire day to take care of all the logistics. Moreover, if/when any issues came up, she made great judgement calls to resolve them in ways that aligned with our vision. We didn’t have to worry about a thing. Anne Marie’s calming presence on the day also meant the world to us. She was there to support us during the big moments and I will never forget her absolute joy upon seeing me in my dress for the first time and her encouragement right before I walked down the aisle. When you work with Anne Marie, you come to learn that you are not just working with an experienced wedding planner, but someone who genuinely cares about you. We cannot thank her enough for all the hours of work and care she dedicated to our wedding. If you are planning to get married in the Bahamas, don’t hesitate to reach out to Anne Marie! We love you Anne Marie!! (Photos attached are by our talented photographer, Christina Ysaguirre, who Anne Marie supported us to secure for the day!)

Mrs. Anna made planning a destination wedding a breeze! Once we connected with her and shared our vision, she immediately began bringing it to life, even down to the little details. She's efficient, professional, and so personable! Before arriving in the Bahamas, she created a detailed itinerary for the week of the wedding. She picked us up to take care of the legal documents. Effectively communicated with us during the week. There was a fierce thunderstorm the morning of our wedding, as we were to wed that evening. Not once did we worry because we knew Mrs. Anna had it under control. We contacted her about a contingency plan; of course, she had a plan. Without a doubt, the evening turned out beautifully! If you are considering a destination wedding in Nassau, Mrs. Anna is your lady! From the first time we spoke with her, we KNEW she was heaven-sent and would make this seamless for us. The only thing we had to do was pick a dress and a tuxedo and show up. Mrs. Anna took care of the rest! Thank you again, Mrs. Anna, for making our day so magical. I continuously replay that day in my head! ❤️

Excellence in Exuma. What an incredible experience for our special wedding day. Everything was perfect. Anna provided such a personal touch that no other could provide. From the custom arch for the ceremony to the flowers being hand designed, all could not have been more perfect. In addition, the number of local contacts working closely with Anna made every step of the wedding memorable without any issues, from the taxi service to the boat rental to the live band entertainment and world-class chief. Every moment went flawlessly. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!!!!

We chose Jasmine because her prices are very reasonable, but we quickly discovered she offers so much more than that. At first, we weren’t completely sure about elopement plan, but Jasmine was incredibly patient and supportive throughout the process. She even helped us secure a venue that wasn’t originally listed as an option, something we appreciated so much. She made everything absolutely stress-free. A few additional requests came up just days before our ceremony, and she still managed to make everything happen flawlessly. The venue, the reverend, the photographer, everything was PERFECT. Our ceremony day turned out even better than we expected. We even started earlier than planned, which we were so grateful for. We truly cannot thank Jasmine enough for making our special day unforgettable.

Thanks to this wonderful company, my husband and I had such a beautiful wedding and enjoyed every part so much! Our only complaint we could possibly have is wishing our ceremony could’ve been longer because it was so perfect! Our photographer did an incredible job on all of the photos, the cake was EXACTLY as pictured on my inspiration board, the food was absolutely delicious and the service was impeccable! The musician was great, and all our guests loved the team that coordinated! Thank you for working with Events By Kanei to achieve my dream wedding

Mariam, Ivis, and Isis at Coordinate Cuba are angels! They orchestrated our dream wedding in Havana and were an absolute joy to work with the entire step of the way. From the very first day of planning, Mariam and her team were eager to answer all of our questions and meticulously planned every detail of our destination wedding. The vendors that they work with are also amazing, and they all went above and beyond to ensure that our vision would come to life. Ivis and Isis provided amazing support on the big day, which allowed me to really enjoy the day and relax because I knew I didn't have to worry about a thing with the team that I had. My friends and family can't stop raving about how amazing the wedding coordinators were! I cannot say enough great things about these ladies, they're truly the best in the biz! Thank you Coordinate Cuba!
