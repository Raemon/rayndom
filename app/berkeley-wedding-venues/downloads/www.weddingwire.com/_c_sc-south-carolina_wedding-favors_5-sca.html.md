Kate was, hands down, our favorite vendor throughout the entire wedding planning process. She was responsive, thoughtful, and so kind every step of the way. It truly felt like having a friend by my side. Our painting is nothing short of breathtaking and is beyond anything we could’ve imagined. Kate is unbelievably talented. She asked thoughtful questions, patiently listened as I shared my vision, and captured the moment so beautifully!! All of our guests LOVED watching her do her work throughout the night! If you’re thinking about hiring a live painter, stop thinking and just book her. She’s a dream to work with, and her work is something you’ll treasure forever.

I ordered 4 oz. Hex Jar (Great for Wedding Favors)..$2.50 each. I cut some pretty chic round fabric and tied it with some twine. Next I bought some small wooden hearts form Michaels and burned our initials into the wood. It was the perfect Wedding Favor. They also shipped it to us. Which was such a time savor. They asked if we wanted the labels on or off. We kept them on so everyone could see where it was from. The honey is amazing. It has a wonderful sweet flavor that I've never tasted in honey before. I want some tea just thinking about it, Yum! It's family owned so you know you will receive excellent and friendly service. Thank you so much.

Indah, a small family run mobile coffee shop, roasted and packaged 2 oz bags of coffee for our favors. They charged us for the coffee, personalized stamp, bags and our color ribbon tied on the bags. They priced it for us packing and sealing the coffee and also priced it with a small extra fee for them packing and sealing it. Even with them packing it, it was under $2 a person for the favors.

I really still am in awe of how amazing having Ben create a live painting at our wedding was. This was hands down the best decision we ever could have made to make our wedding day even more special and memorable. If you are reading the review you have to trust me and BOOK HIM! He truly is the kindest, most personable guy, mingling with our family and friends throughout the night and allowing them to watch all parts of his amazing painting process. Ben as well as his wife, were in contact with me well before the wedding to prepare for the day to minimize any stress the day of. Ben asked me questions on exactly what part of the night that I wanted him to capture, and he was so enthusiastic and excited! I am still receiving phone calls and text messages from family and friends begging me to see the final product! I truly feel that Ben made our wedding day the best day of our lives, and now we can actually have a piece of such a special time, in our home, forever! Thank you Ben! You truly are amazing at what you do!!!

The Lowcountry Store Team did an excellent job creating centerpieces for our son's rehearsal dinner - and with only 2 days notice! The centerpieces were so fabulous we added them to the reception flowers the next day. They were very easy to work with and the flowers were lovely!

Christina makes the tastiest cake pops. She worked with us from day one until THE day. She provided a phenomenal sample, which my fiance' really appreciated and worked meticulously to make sure the cake pop colors, size and presentation were exactly perfect. I feel like I gained a friend during this whole process. We are already getting requests for her cake pops for my sister-in-law's upcoming baby shower.

Having Laura at our wedding was a dream! She did amazing and we are still getting questions about her info/comments from family and friends on how stunning her work is! I always knew I wanted a live painter at my wedding (since i was a little girl) but laura took that dream and went above and beyond! We are so excited to get her work up on our wall!! 10/10 recommend!!!!
