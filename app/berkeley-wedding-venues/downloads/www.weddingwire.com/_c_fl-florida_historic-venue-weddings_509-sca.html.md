The ladies are absolutely wonderful, they’ve stayed so patient with my 10 million questions! Especially Kailee (I hope I spelled that right). She’s incredibly welcoming every single time I come in for a tour. The entire team makes the planning process feel so much less stressful, and you can really tell they care about their couples. The venue itself is beautiful, but the staff is what truly makes it special. I’m so grateful for all their help and kindness so far! I cannot wait until we say I Do here!!! EKKK!!!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU

We absolutely fell in love when we saw this place and knew that it was the ONE for our special day! I live in Europe so my mom had to facetime me when she went to look at the venue, and even only seeing it through video did I know that it would be perfect. Chianna was soo lovely through the whole process and really helpful. The landscaping was absolutely gorgeous! I especially love the backdrop behind our arch where we had our ceremony with all the lush plants. And of course the bougainvillea!! Everyone raved about how lovely it was to have cocktail hour under it. We really couldn't believe how smooth and stress-free everything was and if I could I would do it over and over again at the Peña-Peck House! I highly recommend this venue if you want something classic, elegant, easy, and special!

We recently had our small wedding at the Historic Entrance of Pinecrest Gardens, and it was nothing short of magical. The venue is absolutely stunning—lush, tropical greenery surrounds the area, and the historic stone architecture gives it a timeless, romantic feel that felt perfect for an intimate celebration. The staff at Pinecrest Gardens were incredibly helpful and attentive throughout the planning process and on the day of the event. Everything was well-organized, and they worked seamlessly with our vendors to make sure the day went smoothly.

The venue was awesome, it was raining during most of the wedding and last minute had to add on a tent. For the space, I didn't think a tent would look good, and reluctantly ordered the tent just a few hours before the event. It looked amazing, and even with the rain, it didn't really matter. Everyone had a great time, and the tent made it even better and more intimate. Would definitely go back at some point

Our wedding at Bonnet House was an absolute dream - we are still riding the high from a unforgettable day with gorgeous weather and stunning views. Our guests raved about the venue and shared how much they loved the vibe of the various spaces. We are so excited to see the all content from our photographers & videographer - though we did get some sneak peeks the NEXT DAY (shared in review). During the whole process of touring, booking, & planning our wedding at Bonnet, staff was incredibly helpful, insightful, and friendly. As artists, we loved the rich history and vast art collection at Bonnet, and would 10/10 get married here again and again!

We had an incredible experience hosting a November wedding at the Burroughs Home. We had about 100 people wedding party included. Getting ready in the historic home itself made for some really incredible details/getting ready shots. Melissa was incredible as a wedding planner and we worked with her ~10 months out and up to the day of the wedding. Our guests loved the river views. We added on the option for tours inside the historic home and multiple guests enjoyed that too. The entire home staff day-of was very helpful and friendly and all guests were well tended- too. We selected Complete Weddings to coordinate videography, photography and DJ, and that was really convenient. The vendors knew the venue very well. We were thrilled with Christine for photography, Martin for videography, and Alex as DJ; all were quickly responsive via email or text and had no problem setting up meetings via zoom (as we do not live locally). We hired Glamology for hair and makeup and 100% would recommend, Elise and her assistant were incredible, everyone's hair and makeup truly stayed 1-+ hours. Fort Myers was hit by multiple hurricanes in 2 months leading up to our date but we got very lucky with minimal if any damage- keep that in mind if selecting this venue in late fall.

Our experience with Casa Feliz and Arthur’s Catering was nothing short of exceptional, and they played a huge role in making our wedding day absolutely perfect. From the moment we stepped onto the property, we knew Casa Feliz was something truly special. The venue is breathtaking—timeless, romantic, and impeccably maintained. Every corner is stunning, from the courtyard to the indoor spaces, and it provided the most gorgeous backdrop for our ceremony and reception. Our guests could not stop commenting on how beautiful the venue was. Arthur’s Catering exceeded every expectation. The food was absolutely delicious—fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. It’s rare for wedding food to be memorable, but our guests are still talking about how incredible the meal was. Everything was served perfectly, on time, and exactly as promised. The quality and consistency were outstanding, and it truly elevated the entire experience. We were also incredibly fortunate to work with Lori, our planner at Casa Feliz, who was an absolute pleasure and an invaluable part of the process. Lori was organized, responsive, and incredibly helpful from start to finish. She made the planning process feel seamless and stress-free, answering questions promptly and offering thoughtful guidance every step of the way. On the wedding day, she ensured everything ran smoothly and efficiently, allowing us to relax and enjoy every moment without worrying about logistics. The coordination between Casa Feliz, Arthur’s Catering, and our planning team was flawless. Every detail was executed with care and professionalism, and the entire day flowed effortlessly. It was clear that everyone involved genuinely cared about making our wedding special, and that level of dedication did not go unnoticed. If you are considering Casa Feliz for your wedding or event, you will not be disappointed. Between the stunning venue, the phenomenal food from Arthur’s Catering, and the exceptional support from Lori, we could not have asked for a better experience. We are beyond grateful and would recommend them wholeheartedly to anyone looking for an unforgettable wedding day.

Different from other venues, we only had to book the space, and the rest was left to us. We could choose any vendors, and that allowed us to curate our wedding reception exactly how we wanted it. I've noticed other venues require food and drink minimum, but this was not the case at all. We were more than happy with the venue and loved every aspect. 10/10 venue, 12/10 staff

The White Room is the best venue in northeast Florida! We toured several other venues and nothing quite compares. Location, price, and experience is unmatched. Destiny was the absolute best coordinator! We had the pleasure of working with her from booking all the way until the end of our wedding night. She was there every step of the way and answered every question promptly and with professionalism. She assisted us with each choice and made sure everything was perfect. As the bride I did not worry about a single detail on our wedding day. She truly has a gift. I can not imagine a better venue or experience. Our guests have not stopped boasting about the night. hope I can attend an event at the White Room in the future!
