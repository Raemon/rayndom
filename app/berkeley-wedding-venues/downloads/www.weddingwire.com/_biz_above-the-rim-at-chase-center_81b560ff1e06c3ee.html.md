Magical Evening

We had a magical night at Above the Rim at Chase Center. We’re obviously big Warriors fans – one of our first dates was at Oracle – so it was a dream to get married at their beautiful arena. We worked with Kendra (sales team) and then Bella (event team) as we got closer to the date. They were professional, resourceful, and kind throughout the entire process. Of course, Chase Center is a huge arena, and our little wedding was competing with NBA games, concert world tours, and more, so there were times when it took a while to get responses. But at the end of the day, all of our questions were answered, the night went smoothly, and the event and security staff were wonderful.  
  
Above the Rim has its own private street entrance and elevators up to the top floor (including elevator operators who ensure guests don’t get lost). All of our guests had to go through security; no one had any issues, but we did warn them to give themselves plenty of time. The venue space also has its own restrooms, which was a nice touch. We had about 95 guests, and we filled the space well. We held our ceremony out on the balcony with the stunning view behind us (we lucked out with perfect weather). Cocktail hour was supposed to also be out on the balcony, but since the bar was inside, most people ended up spending more time indoors. The reception was also held inside, so the balcony served as an area to get some fresh air while we danced the night away. We fell in love with the view and loved that the Bay itself was front and center from all parts of the venue space.  
  
Above the Rim does have basic tables and chairs that we were able to use, but they don’t have many other amenities/supplies compared to other venues. This means we had to bring in everything else ourselves; this wasn’t a problem for us, just something that couples should be aware of. We also brought in outside catering and did BYOB for the bar. While we had to pay an alcohol license relinquishment fee, we definitely saved money overall.  
  
As part of the venue package, we were able to take engagement photos on the court! It took some coordination and a 7 AM shoot (obviously the Warriors and other teams get first priority), but it was an absolutely unforgettable experience. Then, even though we weren’t supposed to take additional photos on the court, Kendra and Bella were able to squeeze us in after the visiting team practiced, and we took wedding party portraits at center court too! It was amazing.  
  
Overall, it was beyond our wildest dreams to get married at Chase Center, and the team worked hard to ensure our wedding was perfect.

Bayview Terrace Celebration Above the Rim

As a member of a Warriors family, I thought of the Chase center for my milestone celebration and it was the most memorable experience ever! Kendra and company were incredibly accommodating, flexible and went above and beyond to bring my vision to life.   
  
The stadium tour, my photo across every screen, custom draped entry with a champagne greeting. It was a special night.   
  
The catering and beverage options were very flexible. Icustomized my menus to fit my guests. There was a great selection of wine and desserts. The catering and events staff arranged everything as I instructed down to the custom lighting.   
  
Kendra found ways for me to utilize space and decor cost effectively and she really impressed us with the keepsakes for guests.   
  
I can't wait to book with them again and I'd highly recommend booking your special occasion here. It's a beautiful place awaiting your vision to bring it to life.
