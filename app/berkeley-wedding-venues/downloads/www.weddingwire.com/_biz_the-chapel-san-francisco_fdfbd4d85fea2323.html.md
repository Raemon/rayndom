This spot worked out great for our rehearsal dinner, as we were looking for something hip and different and local in character. We rented out space at the chapel's vestry restaurant for our rehearsal dinner for 50 people. Originally we were going to have it out on the patio but it got moved because of rain inside to the chapel bar. The events manager helping us coordinate, Patricia Gums, was helpful off the bat, and the Vestry customized a menu and the space to exactly what we wanted. Everyone had a good time and the rehearsal dinner turned into a bar evening with out-of-town friends, without having to move. Check it out.
