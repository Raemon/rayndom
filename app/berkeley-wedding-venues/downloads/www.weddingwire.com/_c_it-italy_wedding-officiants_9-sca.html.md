Our experience with Claudia was simply flawless. Even though we organised everything remotely from Australia - and only met her in person on the day of the ceremony - from the very first exchange she conveyed a rare sense of calm and reassurance. Her serene personality and elegant presence laid the foundation for a celebration that turned out to be deeply moving not only for us, but also for all our guests, including our very religious parents who were initially sceptical about a non-religious ceremony. Claudia was always available, quick to respond, and incredibly patient with us - especially considering our not-so-swift replies and the various last-minute changes along the way. She handled the complexity of a bilingual ceremony for an audience half Italian and half Australian with great professionalism, ensuring every moment was clear, seamless and perfectly coordinated. The result was a perfect ceremony, without a single hitch: an authentic, emotional and even playful telling of our story. It was exactly what we hoped for - a true reflection of us, of our love, and of everything we had shared with her. Thank you, Claudia, for making our day even more special.

Enrico was such a fantastic celebrant for our wedding! From our first meeting, we recognized that he was someone who was going to bring so much care, consideration, and communication to our big day. The worksheet he provided us to fill out about our relationship was incredibly helpful to give Enrico all the context he needed for his personalized speech. On the day, Enrico was a truly enthralling celebrant, one whose words were the perfect mix of humor, heart, and honesty, terrifically capturing the small details that define our relationship. We and our guests all loved him, could not recommend him enough!

We can wholeheartedly recommend Tiziana! Our free wedding ceremony in Italy was absolutely beautiful, emotional, personal, and with just the right touch of humor. From the very beginning, she took plenty of time to get to know us through several calls, really understanding our story and who we are as a couple. You could feel how much heart and sensitivity she put into her speech. She captured our personalities perfectly, warm, genuine, and with a wonderful sense of timing. Our guests were truly touched as well! It was also very special for us that she held the ceremony in German, which meant a lot to our families. Thank you, Tiziana, for this unforgettable ceremony, we couldn’t have imagined it any more perfect! ❤️

We chose our officiant with our hearts, and we couldn't have made a better choice! From the very first meeting (on WhatsApp), she made us feel at ease, truly listening to us and understanding our story, our values, and the type of ceremony we wanted. The entire celebration was intense, authentic, and moving. Her words, based on the stories we shared about our journey, were able to convey our story with delicacy, depth, and joy, engaging both us and all our guests; the handfasting ritual, in particular, was truly touching. We never imagined we would be so moved, and Micaela managed to do so! Even our guests shared in our feelings and congratulated us on the ceremony, saying it was one of the most beautiful and heartfelt they had ever attended. We wholeheartedly recommend her to any couple looking for a personalized, well-crafted, and truly unforgettable ceremony. 💛
