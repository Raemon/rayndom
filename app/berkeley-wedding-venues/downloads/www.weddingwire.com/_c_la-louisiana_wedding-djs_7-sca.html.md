Our DJ from Xpert productions was amazing. We danced the night away at my wedding and had an amazing time. Friends are still telling me weeks later that the DJ was great. They were also very helpful in answering my questions. I did not have a list of all the songs we wanted to be played. We had the kinds of songs we didn't want played. And we knew what song we wanted to dance to and what song to use to end the reception. They were so nice in answering my calls to figure out how to fill out our dance list. I definitely recommend using them for your next event.

Neutral Ground Sound System is one of the most unique experiences found in New Orleans. To say that David and his team were a top highlight of our wedding would be an understatement-- they tied our entire wedding together! Working with Neutral Ground was amazing, they we so attentive to detail and thorough on every request we had before, during, and after the wedding. Speaking of, after the wedding is what makes David's company so unique. Immediately after the reception, David and his team had previously mapped out a walk down to Bourbon Street with a few stops in between for some drinks (and an amazing dance party)-- all while continuously playing great music on his mobile DJ cart. To be able to perform such a classy wedding for my wife and I, and then turn our wedding into a mobile party was unbelievable. Our wedding was a night we never wanted to end, and we got exactly that with this fantastic company. Parading the streets of New Orleans after our wedding with our guests made us feel so special, and made it feel like the party would truly never end. Hiring Neutral Ground to DJ our wedding was the best decision we made, and being able to have them plan our entire after-party was the cherry on top. David's knowledge of music and New Orleans culture as a whole gave us the exact experience we were looking for on our very special day!

The best dj service you will find. We had a great time and our day wouldn’t have been complete without the amazing dj we had.

Dan was fantastic. Everything ran smoothly. The guests were happy with the sound quality. He even went out of his way to download a song we had forgotten to add to the playlist.

Darryl was so easy to work with from beginning to end! We had a unique family situation and he was so kind and understanding and kept with our wishes. The event was successful and he was so helpful in not only executing great music, but acting as a great emcee as well. Would highly recommend!

We’re so glad we chose Robbie as our wedding DJ. He handled both the ceremony and reception, and he truly went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly. He called us the Monday before the wedding to go over all the details, from the timeline to the music. We asked him to make more than a few announcements throughout the day/evening, and he delivered each one right on time. It seems like Robbie truly enjoys what he does, and that positive energy went a long way! He included all of our music requests (even downloading some songs he didn't already have), as well as using some of his own music. The vibe was perfect, and people were dancing all night. As a thoughtful extra on the day after the wedding, he sent us some videos he had recorded. It was really nice to be able to revisit those special moments right away. We highly recommend choosing Robbie for your next event!

Chris and Mike were our dj and photobooth attendant for my wedding March 22, 2025. They were a blast! Chris knows how to read a room and keep the dance floor full! Mike is entertaining and kept our photobooth going! Our wedding reception had people of all ages and these two know how to engage a crowd of all generations! Towards the end of the night, my wedding party decided to basically turn the reception into a karaoke bar and Chris was so gracious and flexible with us as we had our fun singing! I could not be happier with Premiere Sound Services DJ than I am! I would recommend to anyone for any event! They were just great!! From communication and organization leading up to the wedding and full execution of all things discussed during my wedding, my husband and I are so pleased with the experience we had!

Omega Sound & Entertainment came highly recommended to me from my wedding venue. And let me say they did not disappoint! David was great from the beginning with the booking process to get us exactly the service we needed. On our follow up right before the wedding we discussed general wants and a few specific songs. Each song was played at the reception and he even took on guest requests from songs that became anthems of the wedding weekend. He was an amazing MC as well helping with the flow of the wedding and also providing comedic commentary for the dancefloor. I would 100% recommend him and Omega for your event and wedding needs!
