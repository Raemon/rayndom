I could not recommend Sound Solutions of WNY enough! I had Laura and David play piano and cello for my wedding ceremony, and it was absolutely beautiful. They also provided two microphones for us to use, which made everything flow so smoothly. From start to finish, they were a dream to work with—prompt in answering questions, accommodating with my song choices, and so seamless in their transitions between pieces. I didn’t even notice them coming or going, yet their music added the most magical touch to our ceremony. Truly such a beautiful and effortless experience!

They made our wedding magical. We split the evening. First part was a string trio for the ceremony, cocktail hour and part of dinner. The rest of the night was a keyboard and sax. Everyone was incredible. So many of our guests commented on how wonderful this team was. Patricia was amazing at working with us and putting together this team. Could not have asked for a better night. PS the strings even played Metallica for us! Tell them what you want. They can do it!

Alexandra was great to work with from planning to performing at our wedding! She was easy to communicate with and responded quickly. We hired a trio to perform for 2 hours including our ceremony. We only selected 3 songs for our ceremony and then the trio had free rein. All of our guests raved about the selection they played and didn’t want the set to end! Our guests are still talking about the music and how they enjoyed guessing the songs being played. Thank you for providing beautiful entertainment at our wedding!

We booked A Touch of Woodwinds for our wedding cocktail hour and would do it again in a heartbeat! Tom was prompt and professional during the wedding planning process, always available to take song requests and discuss any details. The music was beautiful and set the mood for our evening on a gorgeous day surrounded by fall foliage and our loved ones. We appreciated that the string quartet dressed in black-tie attire and put so much heart and joy into performing on our wedding day. Their pricing was also fair and fit within our budget. We highly recommend their services for your wedding or next special event!

We hired the trio for our wedding on 9/3/23. It was absolutely beautiful! They played for my ceremony, despite the heat. My guests said it was a beautiful touch and they actually thought it was a recording because they were so talented. Definitely added a special quality to my ceremony.

Natalie was such a wonderful addition to our wedding day! She played the violin at both our church wedding ceremony and our day of ceremony at the venue and cocktail hour. Her music was such an elegant touch to the day. Natalie was professional, responsive and so easy to work with. She checked in several times to make sure everything was going to be perfect for our day and it was. I would highly recommend to have Natalie as part of your celebration!

Randy and Topu were fantastic to work with and did an amazing job performing during our ceremony and cocktail hour! They are talented musicians and have an extensive repertoire, including Bossanova, which my husband really appreciated (he's Brazilian). We just loved the cello + guitar combo. They created the perfect vibe for us - romantic, elegant, and modern. We highly recommend Randy and Topu!

My husband and I got married last week at Lawrence Memorial Chapel and Lisa played the most beautiful music on the harp. 10/10 would recommend! She even learned a Lana Del Rey song for a very reasonable fee!
