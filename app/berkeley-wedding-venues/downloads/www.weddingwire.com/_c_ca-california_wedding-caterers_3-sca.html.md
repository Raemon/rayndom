Booking Five Star was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. They took care of appetizers, signature cocktails, bartending, dinner, dessert, all rentals, table side service and more! It was truly such a fun process from start to finish getting to dream up the perfect menu, pick all the rentals, taste the food and then sit back and watch Laura and team bring our vision to life. They even perfectly stacked and decorated our 2 gluten free Milk Bar cakes, provided my baby niece with extra strawberries during dinner because they saw she was loving them, and brought in a full oven to make our Beef Wellington entree dreams come true. The food was outstanding and we received soo many compliments about how delicious and fresh everything was, but what truly made this a 5-star experience was the gracious service that made our guests feel so taken care of throughout the evening. We can't thank the Five Star team enough and will definitely be booking them for our next large scale event!

From the very moment we sat down for a menu tasting, my husband and I knew we were going to book with Continental Catering for our wedding. Not only were they professionals in their field about food, but they were so personable and kind! We felt like they truly cared about us as people, which only added to our event’s experience. They even baked our wedding cake (both beautiful and delicious). We loved talking with every team member!! They made detail planning and organization so easy as well. On the day of our wedding, we felt so taken care of, and got so many compliments on the food itself. It truly felt like we had good friends making our guests a home cooked meal. Thank you all again for such a lovely experience!

We loved working with Command Performance Catering! Jesus was able to provide us with even more menu options than we originally thought came with our wedding package, so we were able to create the perfect menu. They were very accommodating with our requests and helpful in deciding on certain details such as chairs, napkins, glasses, seating chart, etc. The staff the day of the wedding were super professional and kind towards our guests. We kept getting complimented on how smoothly everything was being ran. Our food ended up being even better than we expected and our guests really enjoyed it as well! The CPC bartenders were also really great and we loved our signature drinks. We couldn't recommend working with them enough!

DJs catering did an amazing job for my daughter's wedding. From the passed appetizers to the buffet and bar, everything was fantastic. The food was amazingly good. DJs made the event very elegant with the table service of wine and champaign. I would highly recommend DJ's catering for any event.

I held my 9/21/24 wedding reception here at CGC. Kim was an absolute joy to work with- she was so friendly, professional, and had everything very organized (something that I lack in!) She helped me get everything decided in a timely manner, allowed us to customize as much as we could, and was an incredibly affordable option for our 75 person wedding. I can't gush further how delicious dinner was. I have sensory issues and anxiety with food, so saying that I was EXCITED to eat at my wedding is beyond a huge win. The taste testing was incredible and the day of, all of our guests went crazy for our menu. By far the most memorable part of the day was dinner- we were all impressed by how delicious everything was and we devoured the mashed potatoes! Kim knew how much I loved them and was able to save me some to go to eat during our honeymoon which was so sweet of her (and delicious!) The venue itself is so unique, gorgeous, and I can honestly say we had the time of our lives that night. Everything was clean, organized, and she made the whole thing easier to plan and painless! Kim, genuinely from the bottom of my heart, it was the wedding of my dreams and it couldn't have happened without you. I didn't think it was going to be possible for me, but you made dreams come true. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

They were a dream to work with for my wedding. Everyone was professional and communicated well. The food we had was amazing (shout to Chef Phyllis and her team). Noemi, our coordinator, was calm and kind and was a joy to work with. Everything went incredibly smoothly, given the short timeline, and we are so glad that we went with AYLI. Our wedding was beautiful, elegant, and so much fun. We highly recommend them!

I went into my search for wedding catering thinking that no one remembers the food but I would like for the food served to taste somewhat good but I also didn't want to break the bank with the catering cost. My husband works in hospitality and absolutely despises bland mass produced banquet food. So with all these factors working against us, I somehow managed to find the BEST catering company in the Bay Area! The other great reviews didn't steer me wrong, Caterman fit my budget, I was able to make additional adjustments and communication with Carmen was great. The most surprising thing happened - everyone remembered and LOVED the food. There are definitely going to be some photos of me stuffing my face at our sweetheart table. Most people told me I would forget to eat but I certainly made it a point to eat the food being served. Catering was thoughtful enough to bring me some appetizers during the cocktail hour right before photos were taken. They brought us our food first and then allowed our guests to line up at the buffet. I can't recommend and praise Caterman enough for a job well done. I wouldn't hesitate to book them for future events.

PTD was very professional, flexible, and responsive through the entire planning process. We have a dietary restriction, and they were just wonderful working with us to help us make our vision come together while being mindful of and working around that restriction. At the event, the food was perfect, and their staff was skilled and respectful. Thank you PTD!

What can I say about Stephen and Melrose Catering? When planning, even a small intimate backyard wedding, takes immense time and effort. Finding the right vendors is the key to making this process easier. Stephen and Melrose Catering was the right catering service for us. We chose Melrose Catering because their diverse entree selection met our dietary needs, including vegan and children. Stephen was "hands on", answering my many emails and text messages immediately. His flexibility was key to addressing and implementing my many changes over the course of the planning time. With 25 years experience, Stephen was able to help an overwhelmed bride navigate the many challenges of wedding planning and to get to the big day. We received many positive compliments of the delicious entrees and appetizers. Their service was first rate. We highly recommend Stephen and Melrose Catering as the best caterer for your event.
