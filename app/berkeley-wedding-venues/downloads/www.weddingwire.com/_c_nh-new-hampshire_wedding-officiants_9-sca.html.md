Jane was the perfect person to officiate our wedding. We wanted something that wasn't too traditional but was still rooted in the familiar and she did just that. The ceremony was lighthearted, honest, and unique in all the right ways. Working with Jane was so great as she really wanted to get to know us in order to craft the ceremony and allowed for as much customization as we wanted. Thank you, Jane!

We were so fortunate to have Steven Dembow as our wedding officiant. From the moment I first saw him officiate in the fall of 2023, I knew I wanted him to be part of our day. Steve is warm, approachable, and an absolute professional—he made the entire planning process easy and enjoyable. He was always responsive, whether by phone or email, and guided us through everything with confidence and care. Steve’s experience truly shows. He brings unique touches and thoughtful additions that make the ceremony even more personal and memorable. He also provided helpful guidance in the lead-up to the wedding, ensuring that every detail was organized and everyone felt comfortable and prepared. On the big day, Steve arrived early, coordinated seamlessly with our vendors, and delivered a ceremony that was the perfect balance of humor, sincerity, and heart. We couldn’t have asked for a better officiant. Thank you, Steve, for helping make our day so special!

We could not have chosen a more perfect JP for our wedding on October 10th, 2025. Dan is so personable, kind hearted, and makes the whole process as stress free as possible. From the beginning he communicates with you and ensures your vision comes to life. Our guests are still raving about him. Thank you Dan for making our dream ceremony come true. We are so grateful for you!!!

We couldn’t have asked for a better officiant for our mountain wedding! Sonya quite literally climbed a mountain with us to make our day possible and did it all with the sweetest spirit and calming presence. Her energy was exactly what we needed, joyful, and full of warmth. From start to finish, she made us feel supported and celebrated. We are so grateful she was part of our day and would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a meaningful and memorable ceremony! Thank you so much Sonya! \- Kendall & Derek Springhetti

We had a wonderful experience with Lisa as our Justice of the Peace for our wedding! From day one, her communication was excellent, and she guided us through everything with ease. She was warm, flexible, and made the ceremony exactly what we wanted. A calm and supportive presence, especially for the groom before the ceremony. Highly recommend Lisa to any couple looking for someone professional, kind, and genuinely caring.
