We LOVE having our wedding at ASHM

ASHM is such a gorgeous venue, my fiancé and I could not be happier. WE toured so many venues in the greater Philadelphia area, and this one was by far the best. They have a great variety of spaces for ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception both indoors and outdoors. There is also great history and exhibits that we are excited for out guests to see as well. Not only that, but access to the nearby park allows even more great photo taking locations beyond the already gorgeous options at the museum.   
  
Not only is the space beautiful, but the staff has been so helpful. They have always been willing to show us (and our family members) around the space whenever we needed/wanted to. Bonnie has been integral to our early planning process and helped minimize our stress exponentially.

Thrilled with our beautiful wedding at ASHM!

Our wedding at the American Swedish Historical Museum was amazing! We narrowed it down to three possible options within our price range and we couldn't be happier that we chose ASHM. We felt supported throughout the entire planning process. The venue was beautiful inside and out and has such a unique and timeless atmosphere. Luckily it didn't rain, but even if it had, we would've felt comfortable thanks to ASHM helping us create a "Plan B" ceremony inside the museum if need be. The catering was all taken care of as part of our package and the food was delicious. Our guests were all comfortable and it was made easier for our older family members in particular to have the reception on site. The reception was beautiful and fun and there was plenty of room for our 80-plus guests to eat and drink and dance. I wish we could get married there all over again! Thanks ASHM!

Affordable and Flexible

I'm super happy with our choice to go with ASHM and JAM Catering. The space itself is the perfect mix of what I was looking for - garden party vibes with city accessibility. The versatility of the garden, tent, and museum all in one venue provides guests with a unique experience. It is generally affordable, as far as city weddings go. Additionally, the planning team has been phenomenal. They really have it down to a science at JAM Catering. My fiance and I very happy with our choice and recommend ASHM!

What a great team!

We've had an amazing experience working with the American Swedish History Museum /Jeffery Miller team so far, and I couldn’t be happier! From the start, we had a fantastic tour with Bonnie - she’s incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the museum and what JAM has to offer. Our Event Designer, Dorothy has been an absoulte pleasure to work with - she's extremely attentive, organized, and has made each step of the planning process stress-free. We can't wait for our big day!

Historical Charm, Impeccable Elegance, Wonderful Service!

Working with the JAM team at the American Swedish Historical Museum has been nothing short of incredible! I knew from the beginning that I wanted a non-traditional venue that was still elegant and well-managed, and I found that so quickly with JAM and ASHM. The space is beautiful, historic, and unique, not to mention conveniently located for Philadelphians! I also really value the venue's commitment to preserving the building as a piece of Pennsylvania history and JAM's dedication to sustainability and ethical practices in an industry that often feels so wasteful. Overall, I couldn't recommend them more!

Great communication, beautiful space

My fiancée and I are excited to get married at this venue this fall. The option to have our ceremony indoors or outdoors depending on the weather is very convenient, and the access to the museum during cocktail hour is a great plus. Communication with the planners has been easy as well.

There is no other venue to choose!

This Museum is the "go-to" spot for your wedding. It is truly magical. So many different areas that are honestly so cool and perfect for photos, dancing, etc. I absolutely love working with Bonnie as she is super responsive, so kind and she actually listens to you and is present when she is with you, even though I am sure she has a million other things to do. I am so so happy I chose this venue as my wedding location!!
