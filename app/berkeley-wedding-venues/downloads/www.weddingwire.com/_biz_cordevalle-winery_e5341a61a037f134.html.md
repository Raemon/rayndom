10/10 reccomend !!!

We had our wedding of 165 people here in October. And it was absolutely stunning! I would recommend this to anyone looking to get married in the area. The bridal suite was gorgeous and there was also a place for the groom to get ready. Kristin was very communicative throughout the planning process and lightened the stress load off my shoulders. Hope was the best day of coordinator and I would have my wedding here again in a heartbeat! Along with the professional team that helped out the day of. Many compliments from our guests as well.

A Hidden Gem!

Tour  
* We fell in love with Clos LaChance Vineyards (now CordeValle Winery) the moment we stepped onto property. We were looking for a winery wedding venue that could host up to 200 guests and where you could see vineyards from the ceremony and/or reception site; Clos has exactly that plus a golf course view! Our tour with Kristin Murphy ended with some wine tasting, both red and white.   
Pre-Wedding  
* Kristin was incredible to work with! We had a lot of questions during the wedding planning process and she always had answers! Kristin was quick to respond via email and very accommodating when it came to special requests. Something that can’t go unnoticed was her expertise in the wedding industry and how knowledgeable she is to the property.   
Wedding Day  
* The Clos LaChance event staff took care of everything day of wedding. They set up all of our signage in the exact location we asked for it to be placed. They placed our appetizers at our sweetheart table since we weren’t able to join Cocktail Hour. Not only did they take good care of us and our guests, the food that Chef Lu cooked was delicious (although we knew this coming out of the food tasting).   
Overall  
* We would highly recommend Clos LaChance to anyone looking to host an elegant wedding.   
* Clos LaChance will always have a special place in our hearts. We look forward to our future visits reminiscing the best day of our lives along with a glass of 22 Pirates Red Blend and Reserve Chardonnay.   
  
Forever grateful,  
  
Iannick and Kelby

A Beautiful Wedding Day at CordeValle Winery

Our experience at CordeValle Winery was very positive. We used the venue for our cocktail hour and reception, and everything flowed smoothly. Kristin Murphy, our coordinator, was great to work with and very attentive to my spouse and I throughout the day. The entire team was very professional and had a great attitude, which made the experience even better. The serving staff was attentive, and the venue itself is wonderful with a beautiful backdrop that really elevated the event. The food was delicious—thank you to the chefs—and the desserts were a big hit with no leftovers. The wine was very good and enjoyed by our guests. Overall, it’s a wonderful place to get married and a lovely setting for a wedding celebration. Thank you for making our special day come to life !

Cordevalle Winery

I had an absolutely wonderful time planning and having my wedding at this venue. Kristen and Hope both made me feel so comfortable and helped me through the entire process. Kristin especially with responding to many emails helping me down to the small details and assuring me of any questions I had. They were very clear about price and package, which helps a lot with planning. It turned out to be a beautiful day, they gave us a preferred vendor list that helped out so much! My guests absolutely loved the beautiful venue and I loved the area my bridesmaids and me where able to get ready in, I felt like a princess on my big day!
