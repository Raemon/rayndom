Nick is the man!!!!

I cannot express how in awe and amazed we were with Nick and his performance. We invited Nick to play his violin at our wedding. We cannot find the words to express our gratitude and how impressed we were with his talent. I requested Nick to play "not so average" tunes for our wedding (harry potter theme song & 90s/2000s pop/r&b). Quite a contrast, I know 😋. And boy, did he bring it! All my guest were memorized as he performed the requested tunes. N'sync, Destiny Child, Dr. Dre, and more! His vibes and performance pumped up my guests for the ceremony! Nick is truly one of a kind and his talent is appreciated and needed in this world. Also, as my husband stated, "mid-performance, I swear, he was levitating."

Best of the best!

Do yourself a favor, book Nick!  
I searched for over 4 months to find the perfect violinist for our wedding. When I found Nick I was blown away by his talent. Even better, he was a dream to work with! He made it so easy, and catered to our every request (even wardrobe!). He genuinely cared about making our day so special. He exceeded all expectations!!  
Nick flew all the way to VT (from LA) for our wedding and played during both our ceremony and reception. Now 3 years later and we still get family and friends asking about Nick!  
BOOK NICK! You won’t be disappointed!!!

One of the best parts of our wedding day

I had the pleasure of having Nick play the violin during my wedding ceremony and it was one of the best parts of our wedding day. Nick is very professional, responsible and extremely talented. Nick is local to the LA area but he was willing and able to travel to Santa Barbara to perform at my wedding. Nick serenaded our guests with the most incredible setlist before and after the ceremony. My husband and I chose nontraditional songs for the ceremony. Nick seamlessly and on time performed our desired songs. My guests were highly impressed when they recognized No Scrubs by TLC. Nick made everyone have fun and feel comfortable. Without a doubt I would work with Nick again. We were so happy to have booked him!

Sparkling Strings

Nick was, and remains one of the highlights of our spectacular, autumn wedding in a large Los Angeles backyard. Months before, he sat with my husband and I to get to know us, what kind of songs that meant something to us, how he could arrange them, always positively and honestly. We stayed in communication, he asked great logistical questions about place and time and vibe and was fair about pricing, although I can't repeat how priceless it is to us now. On site, he and his musicians were consummate professionals, serving as gorgeous decorations, to boot! They fit into the landscape and created the most magical soundtrack as our wedding party came into the garden to gather--when the first notes of Going to California played, our best man gasped audible with joy and that memory has me smiling while I write-I can't picture myself floating down the aisle with my dad without his notes--It also made us so happy to be giving any of our wedding budget to an artist like Nick. You'll have a better honeymoon if you are lucky enough to have him be part of your wedding.

Nick Kennerly violinist

Highly recommend Nick! He was a violinist at our wedding and was professional, courteous, and a pleasure to work with. He has a very wide repertoire— knows all the classics as well as the instrumentals for more modern pop songs (a la Bridgerton.) his music made the ceremony and cocktail hour very special and romantic.

The Absolute Best Violinist! 

We had the absolute pleasure of having Nick perform at our wedding, and we couldn’t have been more thrilled with the experience! Nick was incredibly professional, punctual, and attentive to our song requests, even offering thoughtful suggestions that enhanced our vision for the day. We received countless compliments from our guests about him long after our wedding was over.  
If you’re looking for someone who will elevate your wedding with their talent, professionalism, and charm, Nick is the one. Our day was truly made more memorable because of their beautiful performance, and we cannot recommend him highly enough!

Fabulous and gifted musician!

When I heard Nick play on Main Street in Santa Monica, I told my fiancé that we needed him to play at our wedding. We contacted Nick and met with him to chat about the specifics. We felt very comfortable working with Nick, and he was so easy to work with. From there, I emailed Nick the songs we wanted played during our wedding ceremony and cocktail hour. Nick had to learn a few of the songs as there were some classical pieces and a hymn. He did wonderfully! Having Nick added that extra special live music vibe that made our wedding day so special. We loved hearing him play and we received many compliments about his playing during our cocktail hour. I couldn't recommend Nick more for any event you might have. He plays from the soul and you can feel it!

Fantastic Violinist!!

What a fantastic experience working with Nick! He’s not only a great person, but a talented musician and understood the assignment. He played with backing tracks while walking around the venue and created an awesome vibe. 10/10 would recommend!
