My fiance and I were searching for the perfect gifts for our guests. As the entire guest list was less than seventy people, all close friends and family that knew us well, we wanted the gift to be something special. We heard about couples that had made little boxes of mixed chocolates, symbolizing their different personality traits. What a cute idea! Through word of mouth we heard of a little chocolate shop in Menomonie, Wisconsin that sold truffles. Huh? How could a place survive on just truffles. We trekked over to Menomonie, found the store, and each bought a truffle. Amazing. So good. Delicious. They have eight or so truffle flavors to choose from, including espresso, mint, caramel, and classic, and they also have a range in the percentage of cocoa in the truffle, starting at 50% cocoa to 95%. The presentation was wonderful, the people we worked with were wonderful, and if we had to do it over, we would have chosen their chocolate zucchini cake as our cake, too!

we used etsy.com for a number of items - including gifts and guest book (well, we actually used cards that said "wedding wishes for the happy couple" that matched our wedding colors instead of a book). there are so many creative people out there and it is a big help in making your day a little more original.

Our wedding cake was made by Annie B's and provided through Jimmy Duffy's Catering. The cake was absolutely delicious. We had lemon cake with rasberry filling and vanilla icing. There were many delicious flavors to choose from but nothing could top the lemon/rasp/vanilla for us. We are weeks away from our 1 year and I can't wait to have the top tier!
