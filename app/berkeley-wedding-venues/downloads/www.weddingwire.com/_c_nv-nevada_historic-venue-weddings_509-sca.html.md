Twenty Mile House was literally THE PERFECT venue to get married at for all mountain and nature lovers! The staff were all incredibly warm, friendly, and professional as they helped us execute a wedding beyond our wildest dreams. The ceremony site is nestled in the forest besides a trickling stream – it felt like we were in a woodland fairytale! All our guests instantly fell in love with the charm and natural beauty of Twenty Mile House, and many told us our wedding was by far the best they've ever been to. Highly recommend all the preferred vendors as well- Pangea Catering (food was BOMB!), Grandma Janes Place (desserts were so delicious and elegant), flowers were perfect...you cannot go wrong with any of the vendors, but you're also free to find any of your own favorites. All the cabins on site allow for 50+ of your favorite people to stay on the property, and each cabin has a unique and cozy vibe...the party house fits 15+ and is right next to the reception area to keep the party going through all hours of the night (no noice ordinance either since the property is 300 acres of solitude in the Sierras :) We love going to Tahoe but the nearby town of Greagle is a hidden gem with cute shops and tasty treats that we will return to many more times. We left Twenty Mile House feeling like family and hope to return to this forest fairyland someday to renew our vows and keep the party going for years to come :)

We got married here in September 2024 and got to reserve the whole place for our family and friends. We opted to have all of our wedding events on site to maximize the time with everyone. This venue, while expensive, will wow your guests and provide a unique experience where they can connect all weekend long. Emily is very organized, a clear & direct communicator, and made sure that our event was a success. The staff are amazing too and provided a lot of help during the weekend with serving, bartending, and moving tabes & chairs. Our families were able to relax and many said that it was the best wedding they’ve ever attended.

My husband and I met at Piper's Opera House, so for my 50th birthday, we renewed our wedding vows on the same dance floor. I LOVE this venue. The staff is amazing, especially Whitney, who is truly wonderful to work with. The ballroom is enchanting and unique. I was able to have BOTH a DJ and a live band! My guests really enjoyed the ball, the history, and Virginia City! If you're looking for something out of the ordinary and memorable, I highly recommend Piper's Opera House.

Best location in Las Vegas for any event. I had my wedding there and it is literally so beautiful. It's a hidden gem in the desert. I would choose the place over any other in Las Vegas. Our wedding was perfect and our guests had so many good things to say about it and the service they provided. Debbie Deal was great to workout.
