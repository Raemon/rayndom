Ann, Dom, and the whole team at Wente made our wedding day an absolute dream come true! The food was spectacular (which is surprisingly rare at weddings!!) They even went out of their way to accommodate special diets and allergies!! The venue was just stunning! Truly, the photos don’t do it justice! Dom (or event coordinator) had everything running like a well-oiled machine! It was just a picture perfect day! I would recommend Wente for any and all events, big and small! We absolutely loved it! Enough so that we went to their sister site Murrieta’s Well the next day for some wine tasting with close friends and wedding guests! Top notch hospitality all around!

Our wedding weekend at the Purple Orchid was outstanding! The venue was beautiful- a lovely setting for both the ceremony and reception. Our guests commented on the quality of the food and the attentive service throughout the weekend. Interactions with the staff of the Purple Orchid were very good- everyone was friendly and helpful- on rehearsal evening, on wedding day, and at the brunch on Sunday. Thanks to Taylor, Rhiannon, and Derrick for their friendliness and organization throughout- we were able to enjoy ourselves completely!

We had our wedding here in June of 2025 and had a great experience. Overall the staff was responsive, helpful, and ensured our day ran smoothly. The bridal suite space was perfect to get ready in and great for photos, and the boys enjoyed the downstairs area with the pool table and Grooms Suite. We had a couple communication blips during the process when Big Dog transferred event coordinators, where some of our agreed upon event asks were forgotten, and some miscommunication occurred with their new standards of doing things that wasn’t made aware to us upon booking, but overall these issues were corrected and we were able to work everything out. Jose was very helpful the day of in setting things up, and helping our coordinator to make sure the vision was achieved. The wind can get verrrryyyy crazy up in the hills, so that was the one thing we did not accommodate for so our floorplan needed to change last minute to accommodate that, and some of our decor ended up not being able to happen due to the crazy wind. Be sure to think ahead about that! We appreciated BDV’s flexibility with changing the set up last minute, letting us drop off decor early and leave it over night to get the next day etc. They were very accommodating to our requests, which is always helpful during stressful wedding planning. Overall the guests were happy, BDV met every expectation we had agreed upon, and the day went smoothly and as well as it could have! I’d recommend the venue to couples looking for a nice venue with beautiful views, a getting ready area on site, with the ability and freedom to customize your event as you wish.

We had our April wedding at Thomas Fogarty and it was perfect! The views are incredible! I also loved the site for the ceremony on the grass and then the open pavillion for dinner with an inside area for dancing. The staff was also professional, responsive, and very kind. Would highly recommend!

Our wedding at Nella Terra Cellars was a dream come true. From the moment we toured the property, we knew it was the one. The venue is absolutely stunning — with vineyards cascading down the hills, a breathtaking outdoor ceremony space, and a grand staircase that makes for the most incredible bridal entrance. During sunset, we took photos overlooking the rolling hills, and it felt like we were in another world — even though it’s only about 30 minutes from home! We first met Whitney during our tour, and she instantly made us feel welcomed and taken care of. She was punctual, kind, and so helpful throughout the entire planning process. Whitney stayed on top of everything — from reminder emails to quick responses — and truly made wedding planning feel smooth and stress-free. Booking Nella Terra also meant working with Simply Lovely Events and On The Vine Catering, which was an amazing bonus. Lindsay from Simply Lovely was phenomenal — she helped us through every detail and made our day so special. The catering team was just as great. Their tasting was delicious, and the food on our wedding day exceeded expectations. The bridal cottage and groom’s area were great for pre-wedding moments and photos. While you can’t get fully ready in the bridal cottage, it was the perfect spot for final touches before the ceremony. Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how beautiful the venue was! The drive in is a bit winding, so we arranged for bus transportation — which worked out perfectly. There’s also plenty of parking for those who drive themselves. I can’t recommend Nella Terra Cellars enough. They know what they’re doing and do it exceptionally well. Every single detail came together seamlessly, and we’ll look back on our wedding day forever with full hearts and huge smiles.

We had our wedding of 165 people here in October. And it was absolutely stunning! I would recommend this to anyone looking to get married in the area. The bridal suite was gorgeous and there was also a place for the groom to get ready. Kristin was very communicative throughout the planning process and lightened the stress load off my shoulders. Hope was the best day of coordinator and I would have my wedding here again in a heartbeat! Along with the professional team that helped out the day of. Many compliments from our guests as well.

My fiance and I were married last month at Casa and it was amazing! Virginia and Kara, and all of the staff were amazing since the moment we first went to tour the venue about 8 months before our big date. They were all so extremely professional, kind, responsive and very helpful in our planning throughout. Casa offers everything included, or you can further personalize. We chose to use everything that is provided (white linens, chairs, china, etc). We were not disappointed. Everything looked so elegant. And the food - the food was amazing. All of our guests raved about how delicious the food was (we offered our guests a choice of chicken gruyere as well as the filet mignon). They also accommodated several people with multiple allergies (we were told by the guests that the chef came out and directly spoke with them to walk through the ingredients). This and other personal touches throughout the night helped make our night so memorable. It is a beautiful venue with lots of options! I was very concerned at first on how such a large space could accommodate my relatively small wedding of 93 people. But it worked perfect! We chose to have an ivory curtain that blocked off the cocktail hour inside, but it would have been fine without. The vineyards were perfect for sunset photos. We really can't say enough good things about this place. We highly recommend having your wedding here especially if (like us) you want/need the extra help in planning your day. They treated us wonderfully. We loved how we were able to enjoy cocktail hour while taking photos. There were two servers that accompanied us during pictures with a cart food of food and drinks - such an awesome touch! Having a day- of coordinator was another great part of Casa's wedding package. We loved how we were just able to show up and enjoy our wedding! The staff made it about as stress free as a wedding could possibly be. Our wedding was on a Thursday evening which offers a discounted rate - it was a fantastic value for what we got. We highly recommend Casa!

From the moment we first toured MOHI Ranch, we knew we had found the perfect venue for our wedding day. Looking back, we can honestly say that the entire experience, from initial planning to the final send-off, exceeded every expectation. The setting itself is simply magical. We had our ceremony in the vineyard with the olive tree aisle and it was perfect. Even in early November, the vines were lush with slight Fall tones. The outdoor reception under the olive trees and lights felt like a scene from a movie—it’s naturally gorgeous and requires very little added decor. As the sun set, the entire winery transformed under the twinkling bistro lights. This feature alone creates such a romantic and special atmosphere that guests are still raving about. A massive part of our success was our coordinator, Danika. She was absolutely fantastic! Danika walked us through the entire process with expertise, kept us perfectly on track with our timeline, and answered every single one of our questions (no matter how small or frequent). The planning process was seamless, enhanced by the specialized services MOHI provides. We were thrilled to use the design service through Lux Designs, which helped us finalize our vision for decor. The tasting menu experience was also wonderful, allowing us to confidently choose our menu while enjoying a date night out. The food was fantastic! We received countless compliments from our guests, who told us how much they enjoyed every dish. The quality and presentation were superb, and there was plenty for everyone. If you are looking for a venue that combines natural elegance, exceptional service, and delicious catering, look no further than MOHI Ranch. They gave us the most special and memorable day of our lives!
