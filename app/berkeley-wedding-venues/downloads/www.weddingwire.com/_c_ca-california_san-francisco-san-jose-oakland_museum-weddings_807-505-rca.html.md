If you’re considering getting married at the Los Altos History Museum—do it, and make sure you work with Lisa. She made us feel taken care of in every way. When it looked like rain, she calmly walked us through backup options and made everything feel manageable. When we needed help, she had answers before we even finished the question. The most memorable part? She hand-crafted the golf-themed signage for our wedding. It was a masterpiece and became one of the most talked-about details of the entire night. Lisa made our day magical, personal, and seamless. We are forever grateful.

As people who have loved the Exploratorium since we were kids, it was the perfect wedding venue for us! We had the ceremony in the outdoor gallery and the reception in the Central and West galleries. We chose these spaces to prioritize the best exhibits over the best view of the Bay (but the view back into the city was perfect for the ceremony!). Everyone at the Exploratorium was so helpful in the planning stages, expertly answering all questions and helping figure out some complicated logistics with dropping off and picking up decorations (we did all the flowers and decorations ourselves). The day went so smoothly - the timeline was tight, but everyone coordinated expertly! Our 160 guests LOVED playing with the exhibits throughout the evening, and having the Exploratorium staff on hand to run exhibits made it that much better. We truly couldn't have asked for a more perfect wedding!

We loved this venue and all our memories from our wedding. We worked with Narod who helped in all communication. We also got help from Ryan in AV. They were both so easy going and great to work with! We loved how beautiful the setup is. The ceremony outside was so nice. The Redwood Hall is also so gorgeous for photos and fun for dancing. We also really liked the cocktail area. We got an animal ambassador and guests had fun seeing the ferret and kestrel. We got nothing but compliments related to how fun the venue was. We are so happy we chose this place for our wedding. We loved the experience. Thank you to CuriOdyssey for going above and beyond. From communication early on to day of. It was amazing!

This venue was everything we wanted. We had such a wonderful experience and would recommend it to anyone who loves nature and the beauty of outer space. The staff was so kind and amazing. They were incredibly helpful in making our dream wedding feel uniquely us. Budget-wise, it is pricier than the average venue, but the money felt 100% worth it. Plus, the added bonus of knowing that the money supports a great cause by helping educate curious minds. They do offer several wedding packages to work with and add-ons, which was cool. Something to note, this isn't an all-inclusive venue. You will need to find and hire: lighting, DJ, caterer, etc., but they help by providing a list of recommendations for anything and everything. We were in the Spees building, which our guests loved wandering around, and even enjoyed the interactive activities on display. I could go on forever about this place. This was truly a magical day we will always cherish.

I don't even have words to describe how much we loved our zoo wedding. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, requires very little decorating (we literally did not decorate the ceremony or cocktail hour), and is incredibly unique and memorable. I'll admit we got some confusion initially from some people when we announced we were getting married at the zoo, but it was absolutely the best decision we could have made. All of our guests had an amazing time and talked about it for days. We even heard from the parents of the children at our wedding that for more than a week after, the kids kept asking to go back to the zoo wedding! What more could you want? Well, in addition to the gorgeous setting, all of the food/beverages/rentals are in house, making it incredibly simple for us. And the food was great! We got to do a tasting, have signature drinks, and all of the normal stuff you would do at a traditional wedding venue. And the food was great, multiple guests went out of their way to tell us, and the price was very reasonable compared to other venues I've seen. We also had an opportunity for the wedding party and immediate family to feed the giraffes! So, so unique and memorable. We also had use of the antique carousel during our cocktail hour, which was a huge hit with both adults and kids! But the very best part was working with the event coordinator, Carol Mann, and her staff. They were all absolutely phenomenal. Very communicative, very flexible, answered our millions of questions with a smile and fantastic information. Because the zoo does not do many weddings, we were actually able to set up our reception area the night before our wedding! We did everything like setting up favors, place cards, etc. so the only thing that had to be done day of were the centerpieces. That would absolutely never have happened at a traditional wedding venue and it was such a relief to not have to figure out how those tasks would get done the day of. I know this review was completely rambling but every time I thought I had covered all of the amazing things, I thought of even more! We are probably one of the only couples in history to have zero regrets about their wedding day. We absolutely cannot recommend the zoo highly enough!

The Ainsley House was the perfect location for a summer outdoor wedding. We had our ceremony elsewhere at a local church, but came together here for the reception. Despite looking small, it easily fit our 125 guests for cocktail hour, dinner, dancing, photo booth, and more. It was amazing working with the staff (Barbie was fantastic), and they helped make sure that even a self-planned wedding goes off without a hitch.

We loved working with the Parck and Rec department. Very affordable and simple to book. The space is beautiful without being too formal or stuffy. Worked great for us!
