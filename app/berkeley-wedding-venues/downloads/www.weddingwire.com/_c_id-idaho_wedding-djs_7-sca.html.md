Juan and Anna were amazing! We hired them for our wedding and were not disappointed. Juan is a terrific dj and kept people moving as well as coordinating the events of the evening. I recieved so many comments on how great he was. Anna ran the photo booth and it was a hit! People were taking photos all night and she really engaged with the guests. 10/10 would recommend them to everyone.

Tony was the DJ for our daughter's New Year's Eve wedding. He was great to work with- communication, flexibility, pricing, and helping us with a timeline for the evening were outstanding. He played the requested songs, took additional requests that night, and kept the room dancing! I would totally recommend him!

We had a rooftop ceremony and ballroom reception. They provided a sound system for music upstairs and downstairs. During the initial consultation, Vince was very upfront with costs and I experienced no extra costs as a surprise at all! The DJ kept the party going the whole time!

We loved Matt!! Music was #1 for us on our wedding day. Choosing the right DJ/MC for the wedding sets the entire tone, flow, and vibe for the whole event. Matt was absolutely incredible to work with. His experience and professionalism made him such a dream to work with. The sound on our wedding day was amazing and we got so many complements from our guests on the music. He helped us so much with our day of timeline and flow, we would have been lost without him. During our final DJ chat before the wedding, we really felt like Matt took the time to get to know us and our style and it really showed on the day. We loved working with Matt and cannot recommend him though as a DJ/MC for your wedding.

DJ Dave was the best wedding DJ I have ever experienced and the perfect choice for our wedding in McCall, ID. He was responsive and easy to work with. He has a very organized online client portal to collect information and submit music requests. During the wedding, he expertly read the crowd and kept the dance floor packed the entire night - I had multiple guests tell me he was the best wedding DJ they had ever seen and I couldn't agree more! My husband and I highly recommend DJ Dave to MC and DJ your next wedding or big event!!

We could not be happier with our experience with Chuck. From day one, he was extremely professional, responsive, and easy to work with. He listened closely to what we wanted and even offered helpful suggestions that made the day run more smoothly. I had very specific timing requests for our ceremony music, and he executed them flawlessly—the moments unfolded exactly how I imagined. Throughout the night, he followed every instruction, played music our guests genuinely enjoyed, and kept the energy just right. His announcements were clear, friendly, and perfectly timed, and he brought such a pleasant, personable presence to the evening. We highly recommend!
