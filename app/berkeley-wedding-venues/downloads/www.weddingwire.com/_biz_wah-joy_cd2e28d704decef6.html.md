Look no further for the top officiant

Walter officiated our wedding on 11/23/25. From the start we knew he was the perfect officiant. I had searched for Kansas officiants who would do a "Princess Bride" movie opening to start our wedding and we found him. We talked on the phone to see if he was a good fit for us and we loved his energy and personality so much that we booked immediately, our search stopped there! He lovingly crafted the most perfect ceremony that was true to us and we are still getting compliments on our ceremony and how great he was. Extremely personable and a true delight to have as part of our wedding day. He brought us such true immense joy and the ceremony was easily the highlight of the day after getting to marry my very best friend. I would absolutely recommend him to any and everyone and honestly if I could have another ceremony just to work with him again, I would! Look no further for a diverse and customizable ceremony from someone with one of the biggest hearts around. My guests are still telling me how great he was both in ceremony and while chatting with the other guests. Walter is now like family as far as I'm concerned for how much he means to us and all he gave us.   
  
TLDR look no further for the most perfect officiant whether it be fantasy, romantic, sentimental, funny, religious, or any and all above. Absolutely one of our top vendors!

We loved our officiant Zack! 

We had Zack as our officiant and we couldn’t say enough great things. We did the premarital counseling with him and he drove an hour to meet us halfway since we live so far. He was so kind and personable. Our wedding was in the pouring rain and not exactly ideal working conditions for someone, but he knew it was important to us and adapted with us and we couldn’t be any more grateful. Walter the owner sent us so many scripts to help us have ideas of our own, and we loved that because it helped us personalize our own ceremony without having to write a whole script ourselves. We will always recommend this company, as well as our officiant Zack.

Walter was amazing!

Walter officiated our wedding, and we couldn’t have asked for a better experience! From start to finish, he made us feel completely at ease — he knew exactly what to do and when to do it, offering perfect suggestions based on his experience. He really took the time to get to know me and my *now* husband, and to listen to our story. His process was so simple and organized, and he provided a variety of ceremony scripts to choose from, which made it easy to combine pieces and personalize our ceremony to truly fit us as a couple.  
Beyond his professionalism, Walter’s bubbly personality and kind, genuine nature made the entire experience even more enjoyable. He brought warmth and joy to our day and made everything feel effortless. We’re so grateful to have had him as our officiant and would highly recommend him to any couple looking for someone wonderful to lead their ceremony!

Highly recommend!

Walter was amazing! His passion for what he does shows in every way. From the initial consultation, to the planning, culminating with the ceremony, he made us feel comfortable and confident that our ceremony would be everything we dreamed of. He was well organized, responsive, timely, and most importantly showed kindness to us as we navigated our very special.

STOP!! You’ve found your officient!

We had contacted Wah Joy Springfield looking for an officiant. They were great to work with. Their communication, transparency and punctuation were a few things that impressed us the most. After speaking with Walter we were put into contact with Zach, one of Wah Joy’s officiants. While speaking with Zach we found that he was extremely polite and professional. He was easy to work with and gave us numerous suggestions and really helped us feel extremely comfortable. We can not thank Wah Joy and specifically Zach for helping make our special day comfortable and seem less. Although we have no intentions of ever using this company again (little jokey joke), you should not hesitate to call them if you are looking for an officiant.

Wonderful Officiant 

Walter was the best choice for our wedding. He helped us with preparations leading up to our big day by answering all our questions, offering advice and guidance, helping us piece together our wedding script, and taking part in our wedding rehearsal. He was very pleasant and easy to communicate with and made us feel comfortable and confident. Our ceremony went smoothly thanks to him. We are so happy and glad that Walter was our officiant.

Officiant Review

Highly recommend using Walter as your officiant! He was super easy to work with and very personable. You are able to customize your script and give him specific details on how you want your ceremony to go. He did an amazing job delivering and so many of our guests told us how beautiful the ceremony was!
