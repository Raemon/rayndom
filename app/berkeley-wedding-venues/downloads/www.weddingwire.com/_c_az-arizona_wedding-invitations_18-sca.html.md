We went to Celebrations in Paper on the recommendation of our wedding planner and we cannot say enough great things about Rene and her team. We used their services for our custom wedding invitation, welcome bags, ceremony programs, place cards, menus, day-of signage and seating chart. Upon our first meeting, we instantly fell in love with her style, eye for detail and devotion to her projects. Rene worked with us to produce a beautiful invitation suite and our guests were taken aback by the elegant touch she added to our wedding day. We had guests who thought her work was so beautiful that they didn't want to open the invitation for fear that they would damage it and we are still having people tell us how gorgeous our invitation is several months after the wedding. Rene walked us through the process smoothly and professionally, designing themes that tied the wedding together with our color palette and floral design. She communicated with us in a timely fashion and was very patient and helpful in getting things just right, even when extra drafts were required. She combines talent and professionalism with warmth and a personal touch. We cannot thank her enough for all of her hard work and highly recommend Celebrations in Paper for any and all of your paper needs!

I designed all of the paper goods for my wedding from the Save the Dates to escort cards but I needed someone to print them. Joanie helped me pick out nice cardstock and double checked my work to make sure all was good before printing. I was happy with how everything turned out. Communication wasn't always the greatest but everything was done on time and looked good. I needed her professional finishing touches to make my designs come to life.

I happened to stumble onto Domenica’s website and had to contact her! I live in a small town so it wasn’t exactly easy to find someone. I needed someone to write our seating place cards and she said no problem send them over! We called and then texted and she was just such a delight to work with! I sent over my place cards and she sent them back and I was so excited when I got to see them!! She did such an awesome job! Thanks Domenica! I recommend you to anyone!

Kelly is an incredibly creative and talented lady! I just love working with her so much, I find myself inventing reasons to use her services! She designed every single paper product for our wedding that guests still talk about to this day. Kelly and I most recently worked on invitations for my best friends shower which were incredibly cute. I always have a blast with her!
