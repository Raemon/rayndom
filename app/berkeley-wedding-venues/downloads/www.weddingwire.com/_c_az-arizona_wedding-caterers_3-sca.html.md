We had the absolute pleasure of having Creations by Sergio cater our wedding, and we couldn't be happier with the experience! From the very beginning, Randi was incredibly kind, helpful, and full of great suggestions during our tasting, making the menu planning process smooth and enjoyable. On our wedding day, the food was nothing short of amazing! We had appetizers and a buffet dinner, and everything was delicious. Our guests couldn’t stop raving about the flavors, the presentation, and the overall experience. What truly set Creations by Sergio apart was the outstanding service. The staff worked so hard to ensure our guests had the best experience, clearing plates promptly and making sure everyone was taken care of with warmth and professionalism. Randi and her team went above and beyond to personalize our menu, accommodating dietary restrictions and even creating options tailored for the children attending. It was clear that everyone at Creations by Sergio is passionate about what they do, and it showed in every detail. The number of compliments we received—not just about the food but also about the kindness and attentiveness of the staff—speaks volumes about their dedication. If you’re looking for a caterer that delivers incredible food, exceptional service, and a truly personalized experience, Creations by Sergio is the way to go! Thank you again for making our wedding day so special. Kelsey & Matt 2/15/25 @ Arizona Historical Society Museum (such a beautiful venue!)

I am still in awe of how wonderful Brian and his team were to work with! Reasonable prices and quick responses made my stress go out the window for our wedding. I absolutely recommend Casey’s catering for rentals and their service!

Absolutely the best! The entire team, from point of contact to on site service was professional, prompt, flexible and accommodating. The food was absolutely delicious and there was plenty of it. They could not have been easier and more enjoyable to work with. I've used dozens of caterers through my business and hands down, they're the best!! Would highly recommend.

Creative hands was AMAZING to work with for our wedding!!! From the beginning, they had so many options and could truly create whatever we wanted, and the presentation is amazing. Not just that, but they truly did create an elevated experience for our guests and us, which included having plates of hor d'oeuvres ready for us so we could enjoy (and shove my face while I was getting bustled), and we were served our plates for dinner as soon as we sat down. Please hire them you will be so so so glad you did!

Sharko’s was very flexible with options that we could pick from. We were able to work with them to mix items from menus to accommodate our preferences. Communication was clear and fairly quick. They offered to make specific meals for diet restrictions, which was really nice. The set up of everything was flawless and hands off. They slipped in during our ceremony and we’re ready to go when it was time for cocktail hour.

Heidi’s catering service is amazing, I was blown away at the tasting and had so much fun curating our menu. We chose buffet style and everything went very smooth, Heidi’s event staff brought us our plates which was awesome and we got to have a little bit of everything. They even signed our guestbook which I thought was a nice gesture.
