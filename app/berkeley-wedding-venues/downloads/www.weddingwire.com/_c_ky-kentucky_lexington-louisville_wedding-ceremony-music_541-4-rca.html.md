Reggie plays beautifully, and sings just as well! Reggie was on time, showed up to rehearsal and knew every song we requested. He was very professional. We hired him for the ceremony and cocktail hour. Our guests were very impressed with him and we were told by many that we had the best cocktail hour they’ve ever been to, largely in part to Reggie’s performance. 10/10 I would recommend to everyone
