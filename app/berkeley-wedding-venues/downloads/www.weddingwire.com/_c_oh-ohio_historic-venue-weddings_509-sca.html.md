We absolutely adore this place. From the building, to the people, to the food. Everything here was amazing. We had originally booked January 2021 but moved it a year due to covid. The team at The Bell was extremely helpful in getting all of this figured out for us and keeping us in the loop. They had great ideas and thought provoking questions that helped my husband and I figure out what we wanted to do. The venue is absolutely gorgeous and was everything we wanted and more. Having our wedding at The Bell was the best thing we ever did. We are so happy!

Nazareth Hall is an amazing venue for your wedding! We absolutely loved everything about it and our day went so smooth. Bella helped us as our venue coordinator and could not have asked for anyone better! She was so helpful and responsive with every question we had. As for the day of coordinator, Megan was amazing as well! She was on top of everything, we could not be happier! If you are looking for a beautiful venue with everything (including amazing food), look no further then Nazareth Hall! You will not regret it!

A Taste of Excellence catered our wedding at Mapleside Farms, and the whole experience was outstanding! Kaitlyn was our coordinator, and she made the planning process smooth and easy. Pat was the head server; we and all of our guests were impressed with her attentiveness and friendly attitude. The pasta buffet was delicious as well. Highly recommend this vendor!

Walden Ponds Golf Club is a beautiful gem hidden in Hamilton, OH! We worked with Chris to plan our wedding there in September and were so thrilled to find such a stunning historic mansion in our hometown! Chris was great to work with. She is very organized and professional. She was very prompt in answering any questions we had and worked with us to make our wedding day so special. We used the venue for our rehearsal and dinner, getting ready, ceremony and reception. There is not one thing I would change about the venue... its beauty, upkeep and employees make it a wonderful wedding venue!

I'm a wedding planner & stylist & had the pleasure of working at Benham's Grove with one of my couples this past September. The landscaping at Benham's Grove is one of the best in the area! The staff does an impeccable job maintaining it's beauty year round. If you're looking to have a garden themed wedding/event or event so bold as to have a whimsical aesthetic, Benham's is the place for you!

We had our ceremony and reception here and it was beautiful. There is a huge parking lot that made it easy for our guests who wanted to drive to do so and for our limo to pick us up. The entry way is spacious and has a security guard up front for the entire night. There was a beautiful staircase but also elevators for our guests with mobility issues. There were bathrooms both upstairs and downstairs as well. The venue itself is so beautiful we really needed minimal décor for it. There are awesome lights, barrels that were used as tables, and so much character to the space. Our bar package was through them as well. We hesitated when we saw the beer list (no IPS, craft, or seltzer options), but it ended up being perfect. Their open bar high-end option had plenty of other choices of liquor and wine our guests could also choose from and had a great time. The team did a great job – they set up all of the tables and chairs exactly like we wanted, did a great job running the bar, and gave us exactly what we needed. They were very kind and flexible with us as we asked questions throughout the process. Would highly recommend getting married here!

I absolutely loved this venue—it provided the perfect, charming backdrop for our wedding and made our special day feel truly magical. From the beautiful outdoor spaces to the elegant indoor areas, everything was well-maintained and thoughtfully designed. The venue’s ambiance really set the tone for an unforgettable celebration. One of the biggest advantages was the incredible flexibility the venue offered. We were able to do our setup and tear down on separate days, well before and after the wedding day itself, which was a total game-changer. This took so much pressure off us and allowed us to enjoy the actual day without any last-minute stress or rushing. It made the whole experience feel much more relaxed and manageable. Another fantastic perk was the ability to bring our own alcohol. This gave us complete control over the beverage options and helped us tailor the bar to our guests’ tastes while keeping costs reasonable. It was great not to be locked into expensive packages or limited selections. Shelby, the wedding coordinator, was absolutely incredible. From our very first meeting, she was warm, professional, and genuinely excited to help us bring our vision to life. She was always quick to respond to questions, offered helpful advice, and handled all the details behind the scenes so we didn’t have to worry about a thing. Her calm and organized approach kept everything running smoothly and made us feel supported every step of the way. The staff at the venue were also friendly and attentive, which added to the welcoming atmosphere. The venue’s location was convenient and easily accessible for our guests, with plenty of parking and accommodations nearby. Overall, this venue checked every box for us: beautiful setting, amazing flexibility, the freedom to bring our own alcohol, and a coordinator who truly cares. I couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate one of the most important days of our lives. Highly recommend to any couple looking for a stress-free, personalized wedding experience!

I would give The Redmoor more than 5 stars if I could! Mandie and her team are so professional and organized, she was able to put this anxious bride at ease. She is so on top it! She came through on everything promised before, during and after our wedding! If great food is a priority for you at your wedding, you have to go with The Redmoor. It was AMAZING! We got loads of compliments from our guests about how Chef Scott’s food was so much better than typical wedding food. We made a couple of requests outside of the typical menu they were able to accommodate, like Argentine-style empanadas for the groom’s side of the family. They were praised as very authentic by those who came from Argentina! We loved the space and the vibe as perfect for what we were going for-timeless elegance. We were glad we didn’t have to add a ton of decor since the space is already beautiful. We are looking forward to attending other events there in the future!

The Toledo Club was exactly what I was looking for when it came to theme of our wedding & the price was just an added bonus! Not to mention I know the pictures will be FIRE because of the clubs interior. They were also super flexible when it came to making our own plan and my husband and I were club members leading up to our wedding so we made tons of memories before our big day🤍 10/10 would choose every time, thank you Toledo Club!!
