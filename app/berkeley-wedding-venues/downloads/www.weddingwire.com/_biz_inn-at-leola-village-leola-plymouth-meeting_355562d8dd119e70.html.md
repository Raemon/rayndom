The perfect venue for the perfect wedding!

  
We had our wedding at the Inn at Leola & it was amazing! I can't say enough about our wedding coordinator, Gianna. She was so sweet, attentive,  
communicative & went out of her way to make our wedding perfect. The grounds are beautiful & they made beautiful backdrops for our photos. Tracy was also awesome to work with & did an incredible job with our flowers & they were stunning. The food at the wedding was delicious & everyone was raving about it. The pastry chef was also so accommodating & she made me the wedding cake of my dreams. The service at the reception was also classy & top notch. We also loved our suite by the pool. Everything was perfect & we highly recommend Inn at Leola for the food, the grounds & most importantly the service provided by Gianna & Tracy.

DREAM Venue and DREAM wedding.

I cannot express how INCREDIBLE our wedding at Leola was. We worked with Gianna and Stephanie, and they are goddesses in human form. They are detail oriented, amazing at their jobs, and know exactly how to keep neurotic brides like myself calm, while still listening to your needs and keeping you up to date.   
  
We worked with Stephanie all through the process and she responded to all of my (often random and weirdly timed) emails with grace and helpful answers. We started working more closely with Gianna later in the process, and we worked with them day of our wedding. Really and truly, they made the day better than our wildest dreams. It was SO well planned, smooth, stress free, and beautiful.   
  
If you are like us, and didn't want to go to a whole bunch of exhausting experiences looking for lodging and a reception space and a caterer and a florist, then Leola is the spot for you. It's a one-stop-shop that looks one of a kind. They even has a spa and salon! We all got our makeup done there and we looked GORGEOUS.  
  
And shout out to Mike, the banquet manager! The food was delicious and everyone loved it, and they were super aware and sensitive to all allergies. They were also so understanding and supportive of sobriety, and made sure my husband had cider in his toasting flute!   
  
Truly the whole thing is an elevated experience in a beautiful spot. They even give you a room for free the night of your wedding!  
  
I would get married there every day forever for the rest of my life if I could.

Our Wedding at the Inn at Leola Village

The Inn at Leola Village was the perfect choice for our wedding venue. From our very first interaction with Tara during the tour, to working closely with Stephanie, Gianna, and Tracy, and the incredible teams across the spa, lodging, and reception, we were met at every step with kindness, professionalism, and genuine care. Every single person we worked with was supportive, thoughtful, and truly excellent at what they do.  
  
The entire team was consistently timely, responsive, and warm in their communication. In an industry that can often feel transactional, it meant so much to work with people who genuinely cared about us as individuals, not just as clients, and that authenticity is what truly sold us on this venue.  
  
The venue itself is absolutely stunning, offering a charming, seasonal, and homey atmosphere while still feeling elegant and high end. It perfectly matched the vision we had for our special day. The team went above and beyond to ensure every detail felt personal and intentional; from the incredibly delicious food and fun tasting experience to the beautifully decorated reception space created with Tracy and the floral team.  
  
Our guests could not stop raving about the exceptional service, amazing food, and overall beauty of the venue. We also loved that so many of our guests were able to stay on site with us, which made the entire weekend feel even more special.  
  
Our wedding was a Western/Indian fusion celebration, and the team at The Inn at Leola Village was phenomenal in helping us bring that vision to life. They were accommodating, supportive, and went above and beyond to ensure our cultural traditions were honored seamlessly.  
  
We are incredibly grateful to the entire team at The Inn at Leola Village for making our wedding day truly unforgettable, and we already can’t wait to return for our anniversary. If you’re looking for exceptional, professional support and truly genuine and kind people, you will absolutely love booking with The Inn at Leola Village. Thank you all so much!!

Incredible venue!!

Choosing The Inn at Leola Village was 100% the best wedding decision we could have made!! Everything was incredible and seamless, from the planning process to the wedding weekend. We’ve gotten so many compliments on how beautiful the venue was, how good the food was, how incredibly nice everyone was, and how well everything flowed. Planning couldn’t have been easier, since everything was taken care of on site, and we loved having all our loved ones able to stay at the venue. I wish we could relive the weekend over and over!

Everything all on site, Amazing!

Everything was amazing at Leola from start to finish. As a busy working bride, I loved having everything on site and outside vendors already researched for me. Food, venue, hair, make up, nails, florist, to all staff: all exceeded expectations.

A Dream Venue That Truly Had It All

We cannot say enough wonderful things about our experience at The Inn at Leola Village! From start to finish, everything was seamless, and our wedding weekend was more magical than we could have imagined.  
  
Stephanie, our day-of coordinator, was an absolute dream to work with. She was incredibly responsive throughout the planning process, so flexible, and went above and beyond to accommodate every request we had. On the day of, she kept everything running smoothly and allowed us to truly enjoy every moment without stress.  
  
The venue itself is stunning. Our guests are still raving about the beautiful floral arrangements and how gorgeous the entire property was. One of the biggest highlights for us was being able to host our entire wedding weekend in one place — rehearsal dinner, welcome party, ceremony, reception, and brunch. Having on-site accommodations was such a huge bonus for us and our guests, and it made the entire weekend feel so relaxed and cohesive.  
  
The food was also out of this world. From the hors d’oeuvres to the entrees, every dish was fantastic. And the cake — made on-site at their bakery — was absolutely delicious. Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how incredible the food was, which made us so happy.  
  
We also loved using their salon and spa for hair and makeup on the wedding day. The team there was fantastic and made the morning feel so special and fun.  
  
If you’re looking for a venue that’s breathtaking, versatile, and staffed by people who truly care, look no further. The Inn at Leola Village will always hold such a special place in our hearts.
