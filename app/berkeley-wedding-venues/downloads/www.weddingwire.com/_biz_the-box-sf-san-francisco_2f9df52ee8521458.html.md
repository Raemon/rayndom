## About

The Box SF is a premier wedding and event venue in the heart of San Francisco, California. Seamlessly blending classic allure with modern amenities, this historic building was initially built in the 1920s to house a printing plant for the San Francisco Examiner. It now boasts multiple unique spaces perfect for large gatherings and intimate affairs.

**Facilities and Capacity**

The property features a variety of versatile event settings, including The Main Room and The Gate Room, both located on the top floor. The Gate Room is particularly notable for its 338-year-old Gate Table, the oldest and longest meeting and dining table in the country, which has become a centerpiece for many memorable wedding receptions. The second floor offers private meeting rooms, ideal for both sides of the wedding party to prepare in. The ground floor houses a historic letterpress printing shop and 1850s mercantile, available for photoshoots and receptions of between 10 and 50 guests. For a truly unique experience, the hidden Speakeasy, "The Sipping Room," can be booked. Accessible through two antique fireplaces, this room can accommodate up to 10 people and boasts a truly unique and memorable atmosphere.

**Services Offered**

From hosting large-scale wedding receptions to intimate gatherings, the venue provides tailored experiences for every occasion. With a commitment to exceptional service and a passion for preserving history, The Box SF ensures that each event is successful and spectacular. Contact their dedicated team to begin planning a wedding day you and your guests will always remember.

**Reviews from past Couples!**

My wife and I hosted our wedding reception at the top floor of The Box SF, and had a wonderful experience! The space is beautiful and unique and we and our guests loved it. Staff during the event was very professional and courteous, and the event coordinators were stellar before during and after the event. The Box SF has a list of caterers they recommend and prefer, which made our selection process much easier (and the food was wonderful!) We elected to include the speakeasy tour as part of our reception and Mark led wonderful tours for all of the guests, it was a highlight of the event. Would definitely recommend The Box SF to anyone looking to hold a unique and classy event!

  
The Event Producer and Venue Manager at The Box SF was an absolute dream to work with leading up to our wedding reception and during the actual party! She went above and beyond, assured us everything would go as planned, and not to worry about a thing - she was right! She took great care of us and all our guests. The venue was beautiful and so us - we couldn't be happier of how it all went. Thank you The Box SF!!

  
I'm glad to have chosen The Box SF for my best friend's wedding! I was their best man/wedding planner, and everything around the wedding worked out great. The wedding had only 24 people attending, and to find a venue for this is no easy job. Most wedding venues can seat over 100 people, and though they are always able to accommodate smaller parties, I was always afraid that a largely empty room doesn't look very nice for a wedding. If you're looking for a place for a small wedding like us, look no further. Thank you!

  
We had our wedding at The Box SF two weeks ago, and it was simply an amazing venue. My best description of the site is that it's a canvas for a creative team to paint the perfect event backdrop onto; the space is very flexible and with the right vision, I believe you could make it into any kind of space you wanted. We had a smaller, intimate wedding, and the flow of the ceremony & reception fit in perfectly with the space: we had the ceremony in the main room, dinner in the separate space w/ the awesome table, then moved back into the main space for drinks and dancing. Pictures were all taken on site (which we just got to see this weekend!), and we loved the local color that we got from our outdoor pictures, and the lighting inside was also great for the inside shots. Humble, intimate & classy. That's the 3 adjectives that I'd use for this amazing space! Can't recommend it more highly!

  
We hosted our wedding at The Box and were completely thrilled with it as an event space. It's chic but warm, gorgeous but affordable, and the staff are totally wonderful to work with. Their recommended vendors are fabulous, too -- highly recommended for any event.

  
My daughter had her wedding and reception last Saturday at The Box SF. Everything was perfect. The bridal party rode up in the freight elevator that was hidden from view by a curtain so we had a moment to line everyone up for the grand entrance. After the ceremony the big room magicly changed into a dance floor. We used the beautiful huge antique table to serve the finger food and there was plenty of room to sit and chat while eating. The view, the decor and the general sense of the space was excellent.  


One of my good friends asked me to help her with her wedding reception. I found BoxSF and it was a done deal. Given that I am in the events industry, I have certain expectations, and theBoxSF met all of them. quickly response time and true friendly customer service. On the day of the Staff was willing to jump in and help out. We easily fit a DJ table, 8 cocktail tables, and 4 standing cocktail tables in the main room with about 65 people. We were expecting 85 and hade the room with the long table available but no one ended up in there. The BoxSF has a list of recommend caterers but you are free to use who you want and they have a prep kitchen.

We live in San Francisco and were dead set on showing our city off to our wedding guests (many from out of town). That said, we needed a place to have a wedding in San Francisco. Easier said, than done. For anyone who has tried to book a reception space in the city, you're familiar with standard wedding markups, competitive scheduling, and restrictions on vendors and catering options at venues you might actually like. We needed to stick to a budget and, feeling defeated, we finally decided to Google. Thankfully, The Box SF was the first result (organic, not paid). When we saw the venue space and met with them, we were excited. We got a deal and the venue was far from "cheap" feeling. We wrote a check for the deposit the next day. We're so glad we did, as our guests had a fabulous time and loved the uniqueness of the space. The venue doesn't need much decoration, and we were allowed to add what we wanted. The space is intimate and perfect for 80-100 people. The best part of their approach, other than being laid-back, is their openness to working with vendors to make events happen; there was no pre-set list of "approved" vendors limiting our ability to achieve our vision and aesthetic for the event. Also, they run their own bar service and they worked with us to provide a cost-effective, premium bar (beers: Anchor Small Beer, Anchor Steam, Rogue Dead Guy Ale, Fuller's ESB, Trumer Pils, Deschutes Black Butte Porter -- awesome). We would LOVE to have another event to justify renting The Box SF again...maybe New Year's for 70 of our friends?

Wonderful wedding venue!

My wife and I hosted our wedding reception at the top floor of The Box SF, and had a wonderful experience! The space is beautiful and unique and we and our guests loved it. Staff during the event was very professional and courteous, and the event coordinators were stellar before during and after the event. The Box SF has a list of caterers they recommend and prefer, which made our selection process much easier (and the food was wonderful!) We elected to include the speakeasy tour as part of our reception and Mark led wonderful tours for all of the guests, it was a highlight of the event. Would definitely recommend The Box SF to anyone looking to hold a unique and classy event!
