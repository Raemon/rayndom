Tracy was amazing helping us every step of the way in planning our beach wedding in Antigua. Tracy was very responsive and kept in touch throughout the planning process. Tracy was able to think of things that we hadn't and was on hand throughout the wedding even reminding the bride and groom of the little things like to eat and drink! The wedding we had in mind was brought to life and is an experience that we and our guests will never forget. Thank you to Tracy for providing such a wonderfully, memorable experience.
