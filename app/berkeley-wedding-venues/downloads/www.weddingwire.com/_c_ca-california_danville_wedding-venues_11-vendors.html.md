Our wedding day at Blackhawk Country Club could not have gone more perfectly. We cannot thank Andrea and the staff enough for making sure the day went off without a hitch. Without her guidance and expertise I would have been lost. Thank you Andrea and the staff at Blackhawk again so much everything! We would highly recommend anyone in the Bay Area to considering this beautiful venue!

We hosted our pre wedding celebration at Crow Canyon and we couldn't be happier. The location is so beautiful with such picturesque views and every guest that walked in was awestruck by its beauty. The have several in house elements like speakers, table flowers, linen options , easel, chaffing dishes that are part of the package. We catered food from a vendor because we wanted more Indian dishes, although their drinks was a big hit. We served cocktails and mocktails and everyone seemed to love it. Now coming to the staff - They're the best. We were introduced to Miranda - The Event Director and she's a blessing. She took care of EVERY little detail and made sure our big day was truly special. She is kind, patient, thoughtful and made our vision come true. A true champ! Also, special thanks to all the waiting staff, their Manager, the receptionist - they're such wonderful people and a joy to work with. We are truly pleased with how everything turned out. Thank you team Crow Canyon. We cannot wait to host more events in future!
