My husband and I had our wedding reception at the main ballroom at Marriott. A lot of the stress associated with planning our big day was alleviated with the help of Marriott's awesome wedding coordinator, Rebekah Bridges. We actually had to change the date of our wedding and move it up two months because of out of the country relatives. We were anticipating that the change would be nearly impossible, or be so chaotic and stressful but with Rebekah's assistance, finding an alternative date was quick and so easy!   
  
What we liked about Marriott's was the quality of service Rebekah and the other staff provided. They were flexible and very accommodating as well as responsive to our needs. Just as the planning went well, the day of also ran smoothly. Marriott and Rebekah consistently provided us with 5 star service and at such a reasonable price!! Most of our 250 guests stayed at Marriott. For us and them, reserving and booking rooms was a breeze. As a bonus, Rebekah made it possible for my husband and I to spend our first night as husband and wife at the presidential suite. What a treat!!!!! The room was enormous with a full sized living and dining room as well as an adjoining conference room, with a total of three bathrooms. The space was definitely appreciated and used as I had our mothers, all my bridesmaids, and other relatives get their hair and makeup done in the suite the morning before the ceremony.  
  
We would definitely recommend this venue if you're looking for a warm and elegant venue that offers 5 star quality service. You definitely get the most bang for your buck at this place.

The wedding coordinator Rebecca was phenominal and very professional. She handled all of our concerns very well. We had a situation with OCC and we ended up switching venues and mariott was the only one that accommodated us and ensured we had everything in order, mariott made OCC look like a bunch of amatures. Rebecca did a great job of making sure that I would not be too stressed throughout the event and I am really glad I switched from OCC to Mariott. If it wasn't for Rebecca I don't know what I would do! Because of the great experience we will be having our anniversary over their for sure!!

The staff @ Walnut Creek Marriott made our wedding weekend a memorable event for us as the bridal couple as well as for all of our guests. Everything from guest rooms to bar and restaurant services to our reception itself were perfect in every way. Eighteen months later we still hear from family and friends that our event was one of the best and most fun they've attended. The staff was supportive, flexible in helping us "do it our way", attentive without being intrusive, and always friendly. As a second wedding for us both we wanted an intimate setting where we could celebrate with family and friends and just enjoy the weekend. We held a great cocktail reception, lovely lunch and, later, a small casual gathering with everyone who was staying in the hotel. Breakfast Sunday morning felt like an extension of the party with everyone wandering into the restaurant throughout the morning! Kudos to Rebekah and the rest of the staff at the Walnut Creek Marriott. You can trust them to make yours a great day too.

The Marriott is definitely a great venue, we had our reception there, and Rebekah Bridges (the coordinator) was extremely helpful, accomodating, and flexible, very timely in her email responses, and was generally a fun person to work with as well. I would definitely recommend this venue to other people, and the food is great as well. Do try to go to one of their open house events so that you can sample all the food on their menu as well as meet vendors they have worked with a lot, it was definitely a helpful experience in getting a sense of what the space could look like on your big day.

We used the Walnut Creek Marriott as a base for all out of town wedding guests and families and held the rehearsal dinner and wedding day breakfast there. The management there provided a very personal touch in helping us plan our events; worked with us to make it special... lots of help, frequent communication, and everything turned out fantastic.

My brother and his fiancee were engaged in February and had 3 months to pull a wedding together. I was asked to help find a venue due to their busy work schedules, I happily obliged. After searching for a couple a weeks I called the Walnut Creek Marriott and was greeted by Mr. Denis Whitaker who assured me that the wedding could be arranged within the time frame required and that he would be happy to work with me and the wedding budget. After viewing a few other venues with my soon to be sister-in-law she completely fell in love with the Grand Ballroom at the Walnut Creek Marriott, to be specific, her words were "THIS IS IT!" I was so relieved, the search was over. It was smooth sailing from here on out, Denis Whitaker and Rebekah Bridges, event coordinators at Marriott, made sure everything was planned without a hitch. Superb service here, I have nothing but great things to say! The staff at Walnut Creek Marriott went above and beyond to meet the needs of our guests during the ceremony and reception, it was literally non stop service and special touches and details that were much appreciated by the guests. OH!! and we had so many guests rave about the food served during the reception, it was magnificent! Hats off the the Marriott chef!! It was absolutely a 100% stress free wedding. We loved it so much that our family will now be holding our annual family reunions and other special events at the Walnut Creek Marriott. We also received so much more for our money here than at any of the other venues the bridal party looked at, small details that make such a difference, which are included in their packages offered. Lastly, make sure you check out the Walnut Creek Marriott first before any other venue and you will see the comparison of value to the others. Happy wedding planning to all!

Rebekah did a terrific job on our behalf. We wanted a room that was already reserved and she worked it out so that both wedding parties got exactly what they wanted. The food was great....the service was terrific....we have nothing but great things to say about Rebekah and the Walnut Creek Marriott

We just had our wedding reception there and they were great. We both fell in love with the California Ballroom the moment we walked in. We've checked so many other venues but this one topped it all. The service, hospitality, cost, food, the catering and banquet manager and their crew were just outstanding. They were so easy to work with. I would definitely have my next event there. I'm actually already thinking of planning an anniversary or birthday party and have it there. All I can say is that if you want your wedding to be a success, have it at the WALNUT CREEK MARRIOTT!!!!!!!!!

[The Walnut Creek Marriott was the site of our wedding reception only.]  
  
The Walnut Creek Marriott was a lovely site for our wedding reception, but it was the event coordinator, Rebekah Bridges, who made it all happen. She was extremely accessible and helpful to me in planning and carrying out the style, decor, menu, arrangements and tone of this celebration. Guests described it as "The Wedding of the Century" and none of the success would have been possible without Rebekah's expertise and hands-on assistance. The entire staff was very helpful, the meal was superb, and the cost made it a very good value.
