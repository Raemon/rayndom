5.0 

We are so, so glad that we chose Applegate Florals for our wedding florist! Emily is so talented and was fantastic to work with throughout the whole experience. You can tell how much care & thought she puts into her work and the business as a whole. We also feel like we got such an amazing value for our florals and never felt surprised by anything, as Emily was always great about communicating costs/etc ahead of time. As a bride who came into the planning experience with very little idea of what I wanted for florals apart from "neutral" and "green", I'm very grateful to have worked with Emily! She was great at giving input/guidance, without any judgement about my total lack of knowledge around anything floral-related. She made the most beautiful bouquets, arbor, greenery arrangements, etc. using all local blooms, which we really valued. She exceeded our (already stellar) vision of how our flowers would turn out, especially given that there isn't necessarily a ton blooming in VT yet in early June! We received (and continue to receive!) so many compliments about our florals, and are always happy to refer friends to Applegate! 10/10!

Olivia & Matt and Lower Notch Farm were such an incredible vendor & we are so grateful that they were part of our day. They have so much talent and passion for what they do and executed our vision perfectly. They truly went above and beyond with their florals, expertise, and execution. They crafted a stunning chuppah that we loved, made me the most stunning bouquet that was perfect, & thought through every detail of our venue. They are professional, kind, and we loved their celebration of local, VT floral beauty. They even did an extra trip to drop off fresh florals for our Friday event. They are professional, reliable, and talented and offer so much at such a reasonable price point. Thank you Lower Notch! We highly, highly recommend their services!

Absolutely LOVED working with Kate! From the very beginning I knew she was our girl. Her process helps her get to know you as a couple and be able to bring your vision exactly to life all while working with your budget. She is so kind and caring, and I knew our florals were in great hands - it was one of the only things I WASN’T stressed about as a bride, which says a lot! Thank you Kate!!!!

Lezlee and Narrow Path Florists provided AMAZING florals for our November wedding. They were creative, professional, and easy to work with. My mom was able to contribute and have open communication as to achieve the exact vision she wanted. Lezlee is very open to creative collaboration. She is a wonderful person and made my wedding day extremely special. Definitely highly recommend Narrow Path!!

Carolee & the staff at Middlebury Floral and Gift were amazing to work with throughout my wedding planning process. Carolee understands the stress that wedding days can bring and relieved my anxiety immediately. Their delivery on our big day was smooth and timely as the venue was about 25 minutes away from their shoppe. The flowers were fresh, well-constructed and absolutely stunning. Middlebury Floral and Gifts helped every step of the way as I developed my vision with compassion and love. Working with their team was a beautiful experience. I commend them for the love and thought they put into each and every bouquet, boutonniere, corsage and arrangement. My guest were completely floored with the attention to detail. Middlebury Vermont is lucky to have Carolee and her team as a floral staple in our community!

My wedding flowers were absolutely perfect, and Anne was great to work with. The most beautiful dahlias I've ever seen for my fall wedding!

WOW, wow, WOW! Sara and her team were absolutely amazing to work with for our wedding! Sara is extremely professional, was always on time, and helped to deliver on our floral fall mountain vision since day 1! She is kind, caring, and works so efficiently to make your ideal vision come true on the wedding day! I cannot recommend Sara and her team enough for all things floral in Vermont! She is SIMPLY THE BEST and made our day so beautiful with her incredible talent and floral design. Thank you for all you did Sara! Appreciate you so much!
