We celebrated our wedding in September 2025 at Five 8 Ranch, and it was truly perfect. The owners of the property were incredibly accommodating and worked so hard to make the ranch a beautiful place for our special day. Our wedding planner and the Five 8 Ranch team worked seamlessly together, which made the entire planning process stress-free. The ranch is absolutely stunning. The trees, ponds, wide-open landscape, and farm animals created the most picturesque backdrop. Our photos turned out beautifully, and the venue offered so many different options for unique and charming photo locations. Transportation throughout the venue was such a special part of the day. Guests enjoyed a tractor ride with hay bales, a fun and memorable way to travel across the ranch. Along the way, they were able to see the animals on the property, adding a charming and personal touch to the experience. The Airbnb on the property was another huge plus. It provided a comfortable, convenient space for part of the bridal party to stay in and get ready on the day of the wedding. One of the standout features of Five 8 Ranch is its versatility. The pickleball court was transformed into an incredible dance floor and reception area, creating a fun and unique setup that our guests absolutely loved. Overall, Five 8 Ranch is a gorgeous and welcoming venue for couples who want a relaxed outdoor setting with plenty of natural charm and flexibility to make the day uniquely theirs. We’re so grateful for the care, effort, and heart that went into making our wedding day truly unforgettable.

I could not wait to leave this review because Briscoe Manor and the staff here truly made the difference in making sure my wedding was perfect! The venue is absolutely beautiful and picking this manor was the best decision I could have made for my wedding. I want to begin with how organized, friendly and professional the staff here are. Anna, Phoebe and Kelsey are heaven sent. They made sure every request and need was met. The food that the chef produced is still being talked about as the best wedding food my guest have ever experienced. Day of the wedding Anna was right there to make sure everything flowed to perfection. The venue is spacious, and the vendors they use are top of the line from the wait staff to the bartenders. Please look no further and book with them if you want your day perfect and stress free!

The Retreat made our entire weekend incredible. Starting on Friday we hosted a Welcome Dinner & Smores After Party. The food at the Welcome Dinner was delicious and the venue set everything up seamlessly. The Smores After Party was a really fun way to spend time with our loved ones and enjoy those summer camp vibes. On Saturday we had a little bit of weather and the venue quickly adjusted and made our ceremony inside beautiful. Lexie our coordinator went above and beyond on everything and we had no clue when there were mishaps. The crab cakes were incredible - hats to the Chef. Most importantly, the venue is super dog friendly so our guys were able to be apart of our big day. If you are thinking about getting married here, don't think any further. Just do it. You won't be disappointed.

Memory lane review Memory lane was our perfect venue. They made planning a wedding easy & as stress free as a large event can be. Bobby the owner was an absolute pleasure to work with, as well as all the other vendors that work with the venue. Lynda, the coordinator was always so cheerful & moved mountains to make sure our day was perfect. The vendors were all fabulous; the florist worked with us & our arrangements were beautiful. The catering food & staff were amazing. The dj made sure our guests were on the dance floor the whole night. The cabin was beautiful & clean. There were plenty of rooms for the whole bridal party to sleep & get ready. There is even a pool & hot-tub to use at our leisure. Everyone was so accommodating & attentive. We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect place to get married. If you are looking for a venue that does it all and goes the extra mile, it’s this one, no need to look further!

I got married here in September and I cannot express how happy I was with my venue choice! Crystal went above and beyond to make sure my wedding was perfect. The entire planning process was smooth and there all-inclusive option was ideal for someone like me who hates planning. They were so accommodating and helpful the entire wedding process! The floral arrangements they made me were stunning as well!

Texas Old Town was so easy to work with. They were upfront about costs, details and expectations. The contract was easy to read and understand with no hidden costs. We were able to choose our vendors and Texas Old Town made it easy for the vendors too. Stone Hall at Texas Old Town grounds are lovely and made a stunning back drop for photos. I highly recommend Texas Old Town!!!!!
