Your wedding day isn't just a big deal for you and your soon-to-be spouse, it's also [an emotional time](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/crying-at-wedding) for the people who raised you. Take this as a beautiful opportunity to [thank your parents](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-gift-ideas-for-parents) for everything they've done for you, starting with gifts for the mother of the bride [and groom](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/mother-of-the-groom-gifts). These meaningful presents are a lovely way of letting your mom know just how much you appreciate her. Or, if you're shopping for your S.O.'s parents, it'll show just how excited you are to officially join the family. We've got gifts for every kind of [mother of the bride](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/father-and-mother-of-the-bride-duties), whether you're on the hunt for something sweet and sentimental, perfectly pampering, or truly one of a kind (just like your mom).

## Who gives the mother of the bride a gift?

Regardless of [who is paying for the wedding](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/who-pays-for-what-in-a-wedding), it's customary for the couple to give both sets of parents something special—including the mother of the bride. That said, there are a few different ways to go about it. Some soonlyweds might choose to give a joint gift to the bride's mom as a thank you for all her [help with wedding prep](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/8-things-every-mother-of-the-bride-should-help-with). Other couples feel that the mother of the bride's gift should be solely from the bride as a token of appreciation for always being there. Finally, it's also an option for the bride's other half to buy the MOB something special to say thanks for raising their favorite person.

Of course, there's no rule that says you can only get the mother of the bride one present. You and your partner can both get separate thank-you gifts if that feels right to you. It's also not unusual for close friends of the bride's mom to help her commemorate the occasion. In this case, a small token such as a bottle of champagne or a gift card for a local restaurant will do the trick.

## When should you give a gift to the mother of the bride?

If you're the bride shopping for your own mom, it's a nice idea to block off some one-on-one time a few weeks before the wedding. Planning a spa day, nice lunch, or hiking trip are all good ways to enjoy each other's company before you hand over your gift. If you don't have a lot of time to spare before the nuptials (we get it, [last-minute wedding prep](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/things-to-do-week-before-wedding) waits for no one), give Mom her present at the rehearsal dinner, while you're getting ready before the wedding, or shortly after the wedding day. The rehearsal dinner is also a great time to deliver [wedding party presents](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-party-gift-ideas) if you're giving joint gifts.

## What makes a good gift for a mother of the bride?

The guidelines for picking out the perfect gift are pretty much the same as with anyone else in your wedding party. The key is to choose something you know the recipient will love, while also thinking of something that represents your relationship with them. If that sounds easier said than done, don't worry. We're sharing lots of unique gift ideas for the mother of the bride to help inspire your search. Jewelry is almost always well received, especially when it comes to buying gifts for your mom. A nice necklace or pair of earrings is so easy to wear and acts as a meaningful keepsake of the special occasion. Personalized MOB gifts are another great option that show you really went the extra mile with your present.
