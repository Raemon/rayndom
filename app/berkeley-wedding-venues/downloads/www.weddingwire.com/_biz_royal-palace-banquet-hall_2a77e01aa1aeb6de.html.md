A Greedy Owner and a Disastrous Experience - A Total Waste of Money

I would not recommend this venue to any couple. We had a terrible experience, primarily due to the owner, who we found to be incredibly greedy. We spent over $40,000, and it felt like a complete waste. The bridal changing room was filthy and had no air conditioning, which caused the bride's makeup to be completely ruined before the ceremony even began. Be aware of hidden fees they charge you with after the fact. They also pressure you into using their preferred vendors, limiting your choices and likely increasing your costs. This was not the dream wedding experience we had hoped for.
