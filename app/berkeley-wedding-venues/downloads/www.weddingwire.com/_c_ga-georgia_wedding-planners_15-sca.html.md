Bekah was an absolute Godsend! Everything went perfectly even with last minute changes. Bekah anticipated our every need during every step along the way. I was able to relax and enjoy my new husband and all the guests because everything behind the scenes was completely under control. Thank you Bekah! You're the best!

Lugener's Affair is truly a God send. Aisha and her team made my wedding dreams come true and exceeding my expectations. Prior to hiring Aisha, my now husband and I were stressed out but she made our process so much easier and less stressful. Not only did we use the wedding decor services, but we eventually decided to hire her as our planner and we have absolutely no regrets. I feel so blessed to have had her for our planning and design. Our decor was stunning and she brought alive the heavenly vision I had for our ceremony. People are still expressing how beautiful our wedding was! Don’t think twice about hiring Lugener’s Affair. You won’t regret it! Also she is very professional and works very well with other vendors. 10/10 highly recommend!🤍

I truly don’t know how to put into words how grateful we are for Susan and the Sincerely Yours Team. Susan took the time to really understand who we are as a couple—our personalities, our style, what mattered to us—and she wove all of that into a wedding day that felt so authentic and meaningful. She remembered the smallest details we casually mentioned months earlier and made sure they were part of our day. She anticipated needs we didn’t even know we had. She stepped in when there were minor and major speed bumps and came up with a solution. She cared about our wedding as if it were her own, and we felt that every step of the way. On the wedding day, Susan was our calm in the chaos. She handled everything behind the scenes with such grace that we were able to be fully present and soak in every moment. When I look back, I don’t think about stress or timelines—I think about how happy and relaxed we were, and that’s 100% because of her and the team. Our wedding was genuinely the best day of our lives, and Susan played such a huge role in making that possible. If you’re looking for someone who is warm, dedicated, incredibly organized, creative, and truly cares, look no further. We adore her and cannot recommend her and the entire Sincerely Yours Events team enough.

Ash was an absolute godsend for us, even before we officially hired her! During our initial interviewing phase, she listened to our preferences for our venue and recommended the most perfect spot — one we hadn’t come across anywhere in our search! Her wealth of knowledge about the industry and of local vendors served us time and time again as we came to the big day. She knew exactly what we wanted and she made it happen. We were so grateful to have Ash guide us through every step of the process with her professionalism, positive attitude, and artistic vision. Our day wouldn’t have been nearly as special without her!

LT and her team were everything we were looking for in a month-of coordinator and decorator! We decided to go with HOB both for coordinator and decoration and I'm so happy that we did - they made the process so easy and made the day-of incredibly seamless. They managed all of the day-of details (Zoe was the best!) so that I was able to truly enjoy the day. As a decorator, they were able to take my ideas and turn them into reality and provide expertise on the type of decor that would look great in the room. They have decorated my venue and coordinated weddings at the same venue (Biltmore Ballrooms) several times before so it really felt that that they had everything covered day of. Their month-of coordinator is the perfect amount of support for couples that already have the big vendors selected but want support with everything else. I definitely would recommend them to anyone.

Enraptured Events did an outstanding job with our wedding from start to finish. We had constant communication with our wedding coordinator was always available when we needed to speak with her which made the process stress free. Enraptured Events paid attention to the details which made all the difference in the world. We have been married for over a month now and our wedding continues to be the talk of Nashville. If I had to describe Enraptured Events in a few words, it would be ELEGANT, PRECISE, ORGANIZED, MODREN AND CREATIVE

Laura is incredible! She made our wedding day the most perfect day I could ask for. Throughout the planning process she had all the answers to my questions and made me feel at ease knowing she had everything under control the day of the wedding. I would highly recommend hiring her as your planner! She will truly make your day magical!

Amberly and her team designed our dream wedding in Atlanta, Georgia this past June at Druid Hills Presbyterian Church and THE ROOF at Ponce City Market! From the very first phone call when I was searching for a wedding planner, to the day of our wedding, Amberly stood out to me from all other planners and planning companies!! She was so incredibly genuine, honest, listened to every want/need/idea I had, and so incredibly talented! Amberly started off by sitting down with me and going over my "vision" and simply got to know me as a bride and my style! She then walked me through every step of the planning process, offering the best vendors, ideas, design elements, and expertise! I am typically very type-A and like to plan everything to the tee and with Amberly as our wedding planner, I was 100% at ease, relaxed, laid back, and confident that our wedding would be everything I dreamed because of how helpful, accommodating, and talented her and her team were! Amberly and her team have that special ability to be able to take their creative skills and provide you with a final product that is beyond what you even imagined it could be! Amberly anticipated needs before they were spoken, planned ahead for all possible hiccups, and she kept everyone involved in the planning process at ease and happy throughout the entire process. Wrennwood design isn't interested in selling you on the "most popular" vendors or the "trendiest" things in the wedding space, Amberly simply gets to know you as a bride and her primary interest is in designing a wedding that is YOU and that is beyond what you even express you want! I felt confident in any choice Amberly made and put full trust in her throughout the entire planning process! Down to the littlest of details, Amberly orchestrated and advised us on everything! She has so much experience in this field that she was able to suggest the top tier vendors, give quality advice, help us meet our budget, get the best deals, and had connections all over Atlanta! On top of all of this, she was also our floral designer and my, OH MY! The intricate, delicate, unique, breathtaking design of our flowers was something our guests raved about and still do! I wasn't sure of what types of flowers I wanted or exactly how I wanted them to look, so by giving Amberly a few color ideas, she brought my vision to life! She is truly gifted as a florist and I would 10/10 recommend you use her as your florist! Nothing is impossible with Amberly, she even created the most beautiful flower halo that hung in the center of our dance floor! Needless to say, I will always recommend Amberly, Julia, and her entire team of planners to every Bride I know who is looking for a planning and design team to create the wedding day of their dreams! Thank you WD for blowing me away and for creating such a beautiful day we couldn't have dreamed of!

From the beginning Marina was very confident that she could deliver everything I visioned and I can say she did that and MORE! I trusted her and the process because she is a great communicator so much so that I wasn’t worried about a thing. Marina and her staff was so professional and was there for my every want and need. Everything was in place and on time. The venue room was absolutely amazing! I requested boho decor and the room looked like a picture from a magazine! Our day was so elegant, beautiful, and grand! We had a perfect wedding day… my husband and I felt so special. We will never forget the work and dedication Lebam studios have put into our decor and coordination. I have no regrets and wouldn’t change a thing!
