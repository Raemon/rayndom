## About

The Lodge at Tiburon is a charming hotel and events venue hosting weddings in Belvedere Tiburon, California. Perched upon the peninsula’s tip, it boasts breathtaking views of the San Francisco Bay and is conveniently located a short trip from the city. Couples will appreciate the warm and professional service provided by its dedicated hospitality team. 

**Facilities and Capacity**

The Lodge at Tiburon welcomes guests for a celebration in the fresh sea air. The lodge offers resort-style accommodation and a total of 11,000 sqft of space for events. The venue is flexible and can be adapted to suit the needs of each big day it hosts. Couples can choose between multiple settings in which to celebrate the different stages of their wedding experience. The Sky Deck provides a sun-kissed stage on which to exchange vows before a close gathering of loved ones with views out over the surrounding hillside. The space can be decorated by a floral arch, white aisle runner, and hurricane lights to lend it an elegant tone. After the ceremony, the lodge’s spacious and light Mainsail Ballroom invites the party to celebrate the newly married couple in style. The ballroom is adaptable and its unassuming decor makes it an ideal canvas for event designers to get creative with. After dinner, guests can dance the night away or choose to relax in one of the lodge’s many patio areas which provide a quiet retreat in the warm evening sun. The firepit patio, in particular, offers an intimate setting congenial to long conversations between friends. Furniture, such as tables and chairs, is included in the rental of the venue. There is ample parking available for guests arriving from out of town. 

**Services Offered**

The staff of the Lodge at Tiburon is excited to welcome couples celebrating their vows. They offer a range of services that are presented as part of comprehensive packages. These include a champagne toast, rental of audiovisual equipment, day-or coordination, and setup and cleanup of events. The management is also happy to work with outside vendors and can recommend some of the region’s most well-regarded wedding professionals. 

**Cuisine**

The venue’s lauded Tavern at Tiburon offers catering to events, including service in a number of styles such as buffet and plated dinners. Their menus consist of seasonal fare sourced from local producers, and the restaurant maintains an unwavering commitment to sustainable practices. Attendees will adore the simple yet delicious dishes on offer, from juicy, grilled steaks to intensely tasty dishes of ratatouille.
