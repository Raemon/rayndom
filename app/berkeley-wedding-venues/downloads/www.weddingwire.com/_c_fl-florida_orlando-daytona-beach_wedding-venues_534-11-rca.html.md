We had our wedding at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress, and it was truly a dream come true from start to finish. For our ~75-person destination wedding, the venue, staff, and planning experience exceeded every expectation. From the very beginning, we were blown away by the breathtaking grounds, the seamless organization, and the incredible people who made our day possible. The ceremony at Cypress Point was absolutely angelic. The soft white fabric overhead reflected the light beautifully, making for the most stunning photos, and the long walk around the water created a dramatic, unforgettable aisle moment. I especially appreciated that the pool and water activity areas were separate, which kept the ceremony space peaceful and private. Our reception at La Coquina was straight out of a fairytale. The space has so much character on its own, with flowing fountains, a perfect view of the sunset, and even visibility of Disney fireworks in the distance—it made the evening feel magical. The food was phenomenal, and our guests are still raving about it. The wait staff was just as impressive—swift, attentive, and so kind. Everything flowed beautifully, and we felt truly taken care of. And the cake—wow. As a bride, I initially had some reservations about using a venue-made cake instead of a specialty bakery, but that worry disappeared quickly. The cake they created was beyond what I dreamed of. I showed them a photo, and they somehow made it even better. Plus, the flavor options were amazing, and it tasted just as good as it looked (if not better!). A huge part of why our day was so flawless is thanks to the exceptional coordination between Hyatt’s on-site team and the amazing planning services through their partner, Just Marry! Working with Emylie Rose from Just Marry! was one of the best decisions we made. From the very beginning, Emylie was warm, responsive, detail-oriented, and simply a joy to work with. Her attention to every detail, calm energy, and deep knowledge made the entire process smooth and enjoyable. Our journey with Just Marry! actually began before we chose Hyatt—after meeting Mairead DeLuca at another venue, we were so impressed with the Just Marry! team that it became one of the reasons we ultimately chose the Grand Cypress. The partnership between Emylie and Hyatt’s incredible venue coordinator, Hannah Long, was the definition of a well-oiled machine. Watching them work together was like witnessing two people perfectly in sync, navigating everything behind the scenes with total ease and grace. Hannah deserves her own spotlight—she was the heart of the Hyatt wedding team. Incredibly kind, knowledgeable, and always five steps ahead, she made us feel like we were her only priority. She took care of every detail, answered every question (including the ones I didn’t know to ask), and made sure we felt celebrated at every turn. From sweet surprise goodies to handling uninvited guests and late arrivals with total professionalism, her calming presence made a world of difference. Both teams—Hyatt and Just Marry!—worked seamlessly to bring our vision to life. Emylie’s coordination on the day of the wedding was next-level. She managed timelines, soothed nerves, and even pulled out fans, water, and essentials as if by magic. She was like the best friend you didn’t know you needed—anticipating needs, keeping everything on track, and making sure my husband and I were able to be present and enjoy every moment. One of the most emotional moments of the day was seeing our reception room for the first time—I cried happy tears seeing our vision brought to life so perfectly. If you’re considering getting married at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress, do it. Between the stunning venues, the top-tier service, and the powerhouse coordination between Hyatt and Just Marry!, you’ll be in the best hands. Our wedding day was not only beautiful—it was joyful, smooth, and unforgettable. We will forever be grateful.

Working with Eterna Estate has been such a great experience. Jasmine is very professional and incredibly warm. As a wedding photographer, I appreciate how much she has helped me connect with other vendors and how supportive she’s been throughout. She hosted an open house and it was honestly so beautiful. The venue is amazing, the outdoor area is spacious and perfect for intimate weddings that want that open-air, nature-forward vibe. And if you want something indoors, the barn space is perfect for a cozy or modern indoor setup. The whole place has this modern, Tuscany-inspired feel, and the attention to detail from the team is just incredible. I even wrote a blog about this venue because I truly love it. If you want a wedding venue that is gorgeous, intentional, and run by a team that cares and doesn’t miss anything, Eterna Estate is definitely for you.

Mystic Dunes Resort & Golf Club is truly a hidden gem and we couldn’t have chosen a more perfect venue for our wedding! From the moment we first toured the property and met Rick Martin, our day-of coordinator at Mystic Dunes, we knew right away that this was the place we had to have our wedding at. Rick was absolutely fantastic to work with. From the very beginning, the wedding package he offered was truly the best value, better than anything we could have ever imagined. We were incredibly impressed with how much was already included in addition to how beautiful and cozy the space was, creating the perfect, most intimate atmosphere for such a special day. The lush golf course views and greenery, serene surroundings, and romantic spaces made everything feel magical and timeless. After we booked Mystic Dunes Resort & Golf Club and started the wedding planning process, anytime we spoke with Rick all throughout it felt like all of our concerns instantly disappeared. He was calm, reassuring, and genuinely invested in making everything perfect for our wedding, which took so much stress off of our plates. Even during our wedding tasting, he was extremely engaged and helpful, offering thoughtful recommendations on dishes, preparation, and final selections that really elevated our menu that our guests are still talking about. Rick and his staff also did a wonderful job during our rehearsal dinner, making sure both we and our guests were well taken care of. Even when a few guests arrived late, the team went above and beyond by saving them food and drinks from the bar after it had closed and making sure every one of our guests was satisfied and happy. Our wedding day itself went smoothly and perfectly, again many thanks to Rick and his team. Everything was beautifully set up and ready to go. Rick’s attention to detail and willingness to help went far beyond what we ever expected, such as how he helped steam my veil and bustle my dress before and during the ceremony, and also how he helped with the groom’s boutonniere. While we already knew firsthand that Rick would do (and did) an amazing job, hearing additional feedback from our guests truly sealed it for us. Our guests noticed Rick personally wheeling my grandmother to her seat before the ceremony and even picking up leaves from the aisle by hand, small moments that spoke volumes about his dedication and care. The entire staff was just as wonderful too. Stephanie was incredible in handling our food, drinks, cake delivery, and anything else that we may have needed (she even offered the groom a drink before the ceremony haha). Esteban was consistently kind, attentive, and accommodating. We had met him a few months earlier when Rick wasn’t onsite, and he was just as welcoming then as he was during our special day. Then during the reception, staff members even stepped in to help expedite the bar line for the groom’s father, which our family truly appreciated. There were several moments like these all throughout the entire day that just made everything that much more wonderful and special. Overall, Mystic Dunes is a fantastic wedding venue, and Rick and his staff gave us everything we could have asked for and so much more. We are beyond grateful for their professionalism, kindness, and genuine care, and we cannot recommend them highly enough. We wish we could relive our wedding day all over again!

I was able to plan my April 2025 wedding for 85 people in about 8 months with little to NO STRESS or ANXIETY with the help of Lely, Juan and staff. We were very impressed with Lely and the staff. Lely is soo friendly, professional, and was completely hands-on for the entire event. The food was amazing! Hands down, this house is BEAUTIFUL and has everything you are looking for to plan a very nice, intimate wedding. It’s self-contained with all the necessary details taken care of in advance on site: the set-up, Millenia Catering, the open-bar, the linens, the hotel rooms, etc.....this venue knows what it's doing and will take care of you on your special day or event!!

They prepared the gazebo and looked beautiful and simple. I was able to keep open communication with staff before, during and after the event. Price was lower as wedding was early in the afternoon and we offered a lunch type of food, cheaper option and no alcohol.

## Orlando Wedding Venues: Your Wedding Venue Planning Guide for Orlando and Beyond

Known as a magical vacation destination for families, Orlando has more than a few pleasant surprises and tons of excitement for soon-to-be newlyweds, too! Orlando's sunny weather, world-class entertainment outlets and strategic Central Florida location are just three reasons it's the perfect place to say "I do".

Before you start planning your Orlando wedding, or even if you already have, check out this Orlando wedding resource guide. You'll find important information on a host of wedding considerations - hotels, venues, travel information, weather and more.

## Popular Orlando Wedding Venues and Accommodations

It's hard to talk about Orlando without discussing the big mouse in the room - Walt Disney World. While many young couples regard this world-famous amusement park and entertainment complex as a family-only destination, Disney World is a worthy honeymoon spot, with endless attractions, restaurants and tons of things to do.

But there's so much more to Orlando than Disney World. Universal Studios, SeaWorld and plenty other attractions serve at least two purposes for couples as unbeatable wedding guest entertainment or for their own honeymoon celebration.

Other fabulous Orlando wedding venues include ballrooms, hotels, country clubs and more. The city's prime vacation destination status means that Orlando offers more than enough venues to choose from - for couples looking for their perfect wedding destination, it's hard to beat Orlando's wedding venue possibilities.

While the average Orlando wedding costs $39,000 (about $10,000 higher than the national average), thorough research and a little extra planning can bring that figure down considerably.

## Travel-Friendly Accommodations for Your Orlando Wedding

If your wedding has guests arriving from all over the country, Orlando's busy airports, bus terminals and transportation infrastructure can handle anything. Since the city is already a popular vacation destination, Orlando is one of the easier metro areas to schedule and book accommodations. Orlando International Airport is your best bet for handling out-of-town wedding guest travel arrangements.

Hotel costs and accommodation expenses typically average out to $150 per night, per guest. If you're doing a Disney-themed wedding and are staying at the resort, accommodations range from less than $100 (value resorts) to $500 (deluxe resorts).

Here's another thing Orlando has going for it: The city's flat landscape and numerous interstate highways, bi-ways and access roads ensure relatively easy travel in and around the greater Orlando area.

## Weather in Orlando

The Sunshine State has remained a sought-after location for thousands of knot-tying couples all across the United States, and Orlando is no exception. Generally, Orlando weather ranges from pleasantly comfortable to almost unbearably humid. Outdoor Orlando wedding venues and receptions in the middle of summer are subject to Central Florida's infamous hot, sticky conditions. If your wedding will have a few older guests, that's something to keep in the back of your mind. Plus, you'll have to pay attention to weather patterns outside the Sunshine State - specifically, the Atlantic and Caribbean region - for any developing hurricanes. Weddings from September through November are subject to hurricanes, so keep your eye on the weather and plan accordingly.

From personalized wedding websites to Orlando-area wedding research, we have the [wedding planning tools](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning.html) you need to organize the wedding of your dreams.
