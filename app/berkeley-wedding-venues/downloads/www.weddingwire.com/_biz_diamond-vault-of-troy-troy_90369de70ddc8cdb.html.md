Best Jeweler!

Working with Holly for my engagement and wedding rings and has been so much fun, and resulted in gorgeous pieces that will last a lifetime. Holly is so professional and kind, and such a pleasure to work with - she has such creative ideas, never pressures you, is always open to your feedback, and her designs are always stunning. We had several meetings to finalize my wedding band design, and they always worked to accommodate our needs and what we wanted to see. The whole Diamond Vault team works hard to make sure you have an incredible experience and final product. 10000/10 recommend them!

Custom is the way to go!

When I started my search there were a lot of online companies that had something similar to what we were looking for. I was referred to The Diamond Vault by a friend and we were so glad we did!!! We designed a custom ring for my Husband. We were involved from start to finish with the entire process. We got to see and try on the cast before it was made. This made the process so much more personal and knowing that you can contact a person to help you execute your vision was amazing! Holly was absolutely wonderful! We had already purchased another piece and will be back for more! They are THE JEWELER to go to!

Stayed in budget and listened to what we wanted

My now husband purchased my engagement ring at the Diamond Vault of Troy. They are not your typical jewelry store. They educate you on jewelry and provide you with plenty of options to get the perfect ring within a certain price range. They definitely didn't try to sell us the biggest, most expensive pieces. If you want to be really involved in designing your jewelry and receive great quality, I would definitely recommend the Diamond Vault.

A Memorable Experience

Randy is amazing and the team at the Diamond Vault are amazing! I never felt like I we were being sold or pressured into making anything other than an informed and educated decision about my ring. My fiancé allowed me to select my ring (he's so wonderful) and Randy made sure we understood diamonds, cut, clarity, quality, origins and more. The settings were unique and my final diamond selection looks amazing. Thank you Diamond Vault for making this experience one I hope to remember for years to come!

Will never go anywhere else for jewelry!

Review written by my husband:  
Before we came to Diamond Vault we had worked with a big chain jewelry store to try and design my wife’s engagement ring and wedding band. We didn’t even get through the process for the engagement ring and I knew they were never going to understand what we wanted. Diamond Vault was recommended to us by my wife’s coworker, who couldn’t have been happier with the work they had done on her ring. We went in with high hopes and they were surpassed. Going in to see Randy was like visiting a friend. He is a true professional that will do whatever it takes to make your vision come to life while sharing his expertise to make sure that your ring will last as long as your marriage. You’d think that such great quality of manufacture and service would come at an equally great price, but the rings ended up being more affordable than it would have at the chain jeweler. My wife’s rings turned out so perfect I know I will be back to create even more custom creations with Randy and the rest of the team at Diamond Vault of Troy.

Tim is the man! If you are looking for a no pressure, easy going, but professional atmosphere then the Diamond Vault is the place you are looking for. Tim takes the time to educate you about diamonds without telling you what is "best." Your ring will be custom designed to perfection and it is always fun to stop by and visit with Tim and the staff while getting your rings cleaned. He always takes good care of us and we intend to have a long lasting relationship with the Diamond Vault.

My now-husband has designed my engagement ring through Diamond Vault of Troy. He worked with Rula from the beginning. It was a complete surprise and loved all the thought that went into my ring! He learned a lot about diamonds and rings from his initial visit. He actually unintentionally visited Diamond Vault. He walked in thinking he would just pick out a ring. We couldn’t be any happier with the final product!

Tim and his staff were phenomenal. He was extremely knowledgeable and had a way of explaining everything in terms that made sense to us. He was extremely patient and professional even when we changed our minds. And getting the diamond cleaned every time we come in- that's a nice bonus!
