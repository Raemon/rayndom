DREAM wedding venue

I cannot say enough great things about the Historic Post Office. From day one, they provided direct and concise communication which made comparing venues very easy and is one of the many things that drew us there. The day-of-coordination service is one of the most helpful a la carte items they offer. Our DOC was able to guide us to vendors within our price range, answer any and all questions we had, and really helped us shape our day through her questions and experience. We were one of the countless couples who had to postpone their big celebration due to the pandemic but we were fortunate enough to be able to use the HPO for our elopement in 2021 and celebration in 2022. Having the DOC as a point of contact at both events was so special and she went above and beyond to ensure that our elopement was still a sweet and memorable day. The bridal suite and grooms lounge access kept the day stress free and running on time, there was plenty of space for the wedding party to get ready comfortably, and also provide beautiful backdrops for getting ready photography and portraits. It is so easy to customize your event through add-ons like lighting, the venue itself is a perfect canvas for any mood/vibe/theme imaginable, and the HPO team has the experience to ensure a smooth wedding day. I would recommend the HPO and their coordination services to any and everyone, it is, in my opinion, the perfect venue.

HPO is a 10 out of 10

We did a group tour about 10 months before the wedding date. My daugher was a bit stressed out as time was of the essense. Ellie, one of the coordinators, led the tour and after speaking directly with her following the tour I was sold. My daughter was sold after seeing the bridal and groomsmen suites, but for me it was the warm feeling I got from Ellie. She assured me we could achieve our vision in the time we had and she would make sure of it. For those who don't know, they offer wedding coordinator services for and additonal fee in addition to the venue. BEST MONEY EVER SPENT!!! I could not have asked for a better companion for this journey. Ellie kept us on schedule, helped us with caterer recommendations, as well as, DJ, photograher, florist and even someone to assist with the ceremony. She offered up great ideas for our Christmas wedding. The venue is gorgeous on its own, but dressed up simply for Christmas was absolutely stunning. The suites are the spacious and furnished beautifully, lots of mirrors and space for the girls to get ready and the groomsmen suite has a pool table and kitchen to keep them entertained. This venue is a 10 out of 10 in every way. The building itself is stunning, but the people - they put this place over the top! Highly recommend the venue and the wedding coordinator services.

Best wedding venue!

I knew from the moment we had our tour at the HPO that this would be our venue and I’m so glad we chose it. The venue is beautiful and the bride/groom suites sold us. We had a large wedding party and had so much space to get ready. The real gem of the venue was our coordinator, Ellie. She made the entire process so enjoyable and easy! From the first meeting to the day of she was available at all hours and helped ease my wedding stress. Everyone at the HPO was incredible and our guests are still raving about the venue almost a month later! I cannot say enough good things about the venue and the staff. I will never stop recommending the HPO!

Dream Wedding!! 

We absolutely LOVED having our wedding here!! On our way to tour the venue, my partner was having second thoughts on having a big wedding vs. eloping and after our tour, he was completely sold on the HPO! It was slightly over our initial budget but we moved things around to make it happen and we are happy we did that!!! We personally asked for Ellie (who gave us the tour) to be our day of coordinator (extra fee) and she was so wonderful to work with!!! Couldn't have done it without her! We were upfront with our overall budget being at 30k (we ended up spending 32k, not including my wedding dress) and she helped us prioritize what was necessary vs. a want. What was really helpful is they have some small decor items (candle vases, sign stands, cake cutting utensils, champagne glasses) they let us use, which also helped us save money!! (As that can quickly add up!). I do recommend asking about their a la carte item prices (additional costs for us were napkins and linens) when it comes to budgeting but Ellie was very accommodating and helped our vision come to life!   
  
Since we went with day of coordination services, set up and break down was included. They were like a well-oiled machine!!! They flipped the ceremony space into the reception space and the room was TRANSFORMED. As the bride, I wasn't asked any questions regarding decor setup because my fiance had the information and was able to answer all of Ellie's questions. This left me to enjoy my morning with my girls in their enormous bridal suite!!! We were there from 9am and about 10 people were in there comfortable with room for more people! The groom's den was also really big and had a pool table that everyone was able to enjoy!  
  
We were also able to host cocktail hour outside (made the call about mid-morning) and their courtyard is so lovely! We didn't have to think about extra decor outside because the venue and umbrella tables really spoke for themselves!   
  
The location of the venue was also fantastic because we were able to get a variety of pictures in different spots (by the water, in the park, in front of the church next door, and a mural nearby) and the outside of the HPO is absolutely stunning and timeless! We are so so glad we went with the HPO, their coordination and hardwork to bring our dream wedding come to life. It will always have a special place in our hearts!

Wedding venue of our dreams!

We got married here a couple of weeks ago and it was PERFECT. Truly so stunning and a very unique venue. The front steps provided the most picturesque backdrop. Highly highly recommend!   
  
We wanted a venue we could do the ceremony and reception in the same place and all indoors in case of bad weather. The bridal suite was stunning, it was very large and a huge plus the bridal party could be there all day getting ready.   
  
We really enjoyed that the venue provided so much and we did not have to hire rental vendors.   
We did cocktail hour outside on the patio, the pergola is beautiful and the perfect outdoor space.   
  
Ellie was our coordinator and knocked it out of the park. She was very knowledgeable and attentive and ensured the day went off without a hitch! She advised on many of our vendors to create the perfect team!   
  
Having a hotel across the street for guests then the bars so close for after was a huge perk as well.

Wedding Review

The Historic Post Office simply did not disappoint. The venue was clean and the staff was wonderful. Ellie was our coordinator and she went above and beyond to ensure that our special day was nothing short of perfect. She was available throughout the entire planning process. I knew I could count on her for anything! The venue itself is elegant and had everything we needed for the day of. The wedding party suites were comfortable and spacious, giving everyone plenty of space to get ready and spend the day together. We could not have asked for a better venue for our wedding day. Thank you all so much for everything you did!

Amazing Venue and Staff

Absolutely loved working with the HPO over the course of a year as I planned my wedding. It provides you with the perfect clean-slate venue that allows you to bring in your own vendors and really make the place your own. The staff is so lovely to work with and made the process so easy. Special shout out to my wedding coordinator Sylvia, who I couldn’t have imagined the day without. She coordinated all of my vendors and told me where to go and when on the day-of, which made everything so easy. It’s 100% worth the money to get one because they know the vendors and space so well. Loved my experience at this absolutely gorgeous venue and wouldn’t have had it any other way. Thank you!

Picture perfect day! 

I can’t say enough great things about the HPO. The Historic Post office gave us our picture perfect wedding day that we envisioned. From our venue tour to the day of the wedding everything was amazing.   
For starters, the building is BEAUTIFUL. The white brick, lighting, scalloped windows, and wooden floors are so pretty on their own, it gave us a great backdrop to add our personal touches onto. The bridal suite is amazing to get ready in, and the guys had a great time in the grooms suite.   
Second, the staff at HPO runs a tight ship! The pricing is clear, concise and fair. There are different price points for different budgets. They were great at explaining add ons available like pro lighting, custom name added to the wall, Photo Booth etc which made our day even more custom and special. Everything went so smooth with the planning process over our year of planning.   
And last, but certainly not least Ellie, our wedding coordinator is hands down THE BEST decision we made for our wedding. We worked with her the entire engagement and she made the planning process so easy and made the day of perfect! We had 4 meetings leading up to the wedding. She planned the day step by step with us throughout the year. She gave us great advice on picking the rest of our vendors. The day of, everything was executed flawlessly. Ellie kept us on our timeline and set everything up perfectly. She set up all of our decorations exactly how I had in my mind, it was great seeing everything come together after a year of planning. Adam and I didn’t have to worry about a thing, as she took care of EVERYTHING! The day was everything’s we wanted and more, we can’t thank Ellie and the rest of the HPO team enough.

Amazing venue and excellent coordination services 

We decided to go with The Historic Post Office as our wedding venue because they have these events down to a science. Everything leading up to the wedding went so smoothly with Ellie as our coordinator. Their existing relationships with vendors made that aspect so painless as well. The day of was fabulous too. Getting ready in the beautiful bridal suite, the elegance of the venue itself, and the flip between ceremony and reception was all perfect! We would definitely recommend HPO and Ellie to anyone looking to plan their wedding.

The Historic Post Office is the perfect venue for large or small weddings (or any event, really!). The building is unique because it's historic and has a ton of character and charm, yet is also a blank canvas so it can host many different styles. It is hard to find a really beautiful, flexible indoor space for a large wedding, but this place is perfect! The upstairs and downstairs is a really neat aspect as well that you can't find anywhere else. Kelsey and her team are really dedicated to making sure everything is perfect for their events, and they are also willing to go outside of the box with new ideas. We highly recommend The Historic Post Office to brides, businesses, or anyone looking to host in a neat location with a wonderful support staff.
