## About

My name is Tucker James Callander and I would love to be a part of your big day! I am a classically trained violinist with a degree in violin performance from Syracuse University. I have been performing fulltime in the Northeast for the past 15 years. I specialize in wedding ceremonies and cocktail hours and have done over 250 to date! With my experience, I am happy to help guide you through the ins and outs of the wedding ceremony and help to make it exactly what you want!

I am unique in that I am not just a classical violinist. I am a seasoned musician who plays professionally with multiple different groups ranging from jazz to bluegrass to Irish to pop. I am different in that I can be your traditional solo classical violinist but can also offer a string quartet that plays Taylor Swift and Mozart or a great jazz trio for cocktail hour. I could add in a little bit of Irish/Celtic music if you wanted or a bluegrass cocktail hour. The violin is such a versatile instrument that can speak many different languages of music and I have worked hard to learn many of them. I have a great group of musicians I work with that can be added to play with my violin. If you decide to choose me, I promise to make it special and give my heart and soul to your wedding day.

Some examples of ensembles:  
Solo Violin  
Violin and Cello  
Violin and Guitar  
Violin and Piano  
Violin, Viola and Cello  
Violin, Guitar and Upright Bass  
String Quartet (Violin, Violin, Viola and Cello)  
Jazz Trio or Quartet  
Bluegrass Trio or Quartet

Please reach out with any questions!

Services Offered:

Wedding ceremonies, cocktail hours, dinner hours, concerts and private events.

Fantastic Experience working with Bluebird Strings for Wedding Ceremony

Working with Tucker and Bluebird Strings was one of the most painless parts about planning my wedding. From initial communication, budgeting and scheduling all the way through event planning and delivering a beautiful performance at the wedding, they were very professional and a pleasure to work with. Being a musician myself it was very clear that they were well-rehearsed and extremely talented players, their sound production was crisp and clear while not being too overpowering for the ceremony, and they collaborated well with the other wedding vendors to handle the unforeseen challenges of delivering a flawless wedding ceremony. Most importantly, they gave me confidence and peace of mind that everything was taken care of. I knew I did not have to worry about that part of the ceremony due to their obvious preparation and experience. I was extremely happy with them and would recommend them to any couple or wedding planner that is looking for worry-free, beautiful music for their special day.

10/10 Recommend!

Working with Tucker for our wedding ceremony was nothing less than a dream. We were looking for an untraditional wedding music experience, and Tucker learned 3 new songs for our ceremony in less than 2 weeks - which is a testament to his willingness to go above and beyond for his clients. Leading up to our wedding day, Tucker was incredibly communicative, helpful, and easy to work with - whether it was lending his opinion for best songs for a recessional or being willing to bring speakers and microphones for our ceremony audio, Tucker's care and passion for his work shined through at every moment. We could not be happier with how the music from our wedding ceremony turned out, and we can't recommend Tucker (and any of his fellow musicians) enough!

Haggerty-Mulhall Wedding Ceremony

The duo of Tucker Callander (violin) and Crick Diefendorf (classical guitar) from Bluebird Strings were top notch! They provided outstanding music both while attendees were entering the ceremony area, and also during the ceremony itself. I couldn't be happier with their performance. And they were also extremely helpful and knowledgeable throughout the planning process leading up to the big day. I couldn't have asked for more...absolutely beautiful music and professionalism. I give them my HIGHEST recommendation.

Beautiful Wedding Music For Our Special Day

We had the absolute pleasure of having Mr. Callander play solo violin during our wedding ceremony, and I truly can’t recommend him highly enough. From the very first note as we walked down the aisle, his music added such beauty and emotion to the moment—it was everything we hoped for and more. His playing was elegant, heartfelt, and completely elevated the entire ceremony. Multiple guests told us afterward how moving the music was, and we couldn’t agree more. If you’re looking for a talented, professional, and genuinely kind musician to make your special day even more unforgettable, look no further. We’re so grateful to have had him be part of our wedding.

Stunning Talent meets Supreme Professionalism

We hired Tucker and his band to play the cocktail hour for our wedding. The hiring process was easy and clear (probably the easiest part of putting the event together)  
When the big day came, the band arrived early enough to greet us, wish us well and set up without a hitch.  
I had requested Tucker play 'La Vie en Rose' as my son walked me down the aisle. His performance was perfect and soulful. After the ceremony the band played at the perfect level, impressing my guests while not overpowering conversations.   
If you are looking for professional, world-class entertainment for your event look no further than Bluebird Strings. You will be so happy you did.
