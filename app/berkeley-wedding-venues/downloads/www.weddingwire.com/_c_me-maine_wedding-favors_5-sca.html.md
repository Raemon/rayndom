Since our wedding was in Maine, and we're from New Jersey, we tried to make everything have a Maine theme... and our favors were no exception! Haven's Candies provided us with 2 large blueberry cream truffles in a little bag tied with ribbon to match our wedding colors. On top of being delicious, they were adorable! Our guests were very impressed!! The people at Haven's Candies were so easy and enjoyable to work with too!

Brio Promotions created our wedding favors--personalized drinking glasses. They helped us design a logo with our names and wedding date and select a glass type we liked (we chose a double old fashioned glass). The owner, Jeff, was even able to help us find a font that matched our wedding invitations to give our entire day a very cohesive look. Guests loved finding these personalized wedding favors right at their dinner seat! Our favors were one of the small details that really made our day special and I'm glad we found Brio to help us make them!
