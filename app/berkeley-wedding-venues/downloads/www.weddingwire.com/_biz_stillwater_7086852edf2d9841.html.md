Please think carefully before entering a contract with Stillwater.

We booked Stillwater for our wedding scheduled on September 20, 2025, but had to cancel in December 2024 — giving them over 9 months’ notice. Despite this, they refused to return any portion of our deposit or apply it toward a future event. While I understand contracts exist for a reason, I was shocked at the complete lack of flexibility given how far in advance we canceled — especially since the venue admitted September is one of their busiest months.  
  
To make matters worse, they later booked another event on the same date. That means they not only kept our deposit but also collected full payment from another client — essentially double dipping on the same date.  
On top of this, attempts to communicate with Sarah Tynan were very disappointing. After emailing her directly multiple times to appeal for even partial consideration, I was simply ignored.  
  
Future clients should be aware: if anything unexpected happens in your life, don’t expect compassion, flexibility, or even basic communication. Be absolutely certain before you sign, because once they have your deposit, you will not see it again — even if they rebook your date and profit twice.  
  
This review reflects only a summary of my experience. I have full documentation of the communications and timeline to support the facts shared here.
