Beautiful designs with thoughtful details across all pieces!

Christa was so wonderful to work with for my wedding! She has a lovely home studio with a range of printed samples for inspiration, and after talking it through, she was able to bring my vision to life through a beautiful design system. She had great ideas for bringing all of the pieces together in a cohesive way. Christa was super detail-oriented throughout the entire process and went above and beyond to exceed our expectations!

Top Professional

Christa was one of our favorite vendors to work with. She is so creative and produces such a high quality product. She was able to take our ideas and translate them into a BEAUTIFUL invitation suite and day of paper goods. We had so many complements on her work and they were well deserved! Her attention to detail and knowledge of wedding stationary etiquette is also very helpful during the planning process. She is also just the sweetest person! 10/10 highly recommend!

Elegant and Timeless save the dates/ invitations 

Christa is an absolute pleasure to work with. I was planning my May ‘23 wedding all the way from Boston and she made it so seamless to plan all my stationary details and truly captured everything I hoped for in my save the dates and invitations. She worked with me in getting all my invites in the time we discussed and the process was just so easy. My save the dates and invitations were elegant, beautiful, and came out exactly as we discussed; actually even better! Highly recommend Simply Torn Art and working with Christa!

Truly the best!!

Christa was truly the most wonderful vendor we worked with for our May 2023 wedding! She did our save-the-dates, our wedding invitations, our day-of paper goods and now is doing our thank you cards. She goes above and beyond with the couples she works with and makes you feel as though this part of the wedding planning process is not something you need to stress about because she has it covered! Christa personalizes everything to fit not only the style of your wedding, but also the personality of the couple. We wanted classic and simplicity and what we received was beyond expectations! So many guests commented on just how beautiful our invitations were (definitely don't pass up on the wax seals!) and it really set the tone for our wedding day. Wedding planning is stressful enough and the best advice I have is to hire the right vendors and Christa was the best choice 😊.

Perfect and Entirely Customized 

  
These guys are perfect in obtaining the EXACT look and style you want. Everything can be customized down to the paper thickness and trim on the paper's outer edge. They've got the perfect studio to set up displays that can help give inspiration. The professional guidance can help give some support overall if you get overwhelmedat the process (trust me- it is choosing more than just paper colors and fonts). They are extremely detailed and patient with the mockups and changing it until YOU give the go ahead to finalize and send to print which was lovely and a big win for me to really show the vision before running with it. Besides the save the date and the actual invitations/event details outline/rsvp cards, they also did signage for the event like welcome signs, the monogram for the dance floor, menu cards personalized for each guest, and fun Signature drink signage.

An absolute joy to work with! 

I cannot overstate how amazing Christa was to work with!! She is so gifted at what she does and you can tell how much she cares about the details that will make the stationery come together. An added bonus is that Christa herself is such a joy to work with. I had no idea how much I would enjoy designing our wedding stationery and I completely credit that to Christa! Highly recommend going with her for your paper goods!! You will be so glad you did!!

Simply Torn is simply THE best

Christa helped with all of our wedding stationery beginning with our Save the Dates and down to the last stationery details for our wedding day. She is quick to respond, extremely helpful with creating a custom vision and always punctual (usually even ahead of her own timeline)! She was one of our absolute favorite vendors and made the stationery planning so much fun. We will continue to work with her for all of our future stationery needs!

AMAZING! Highly recommend 

Christa with simply torn was such a joy to work with. Initially I thought that I wanted a completely Different design then we ended up with. Even after creating a beautiful initial mock up of an invitation, she had no hesitation when I told her that I had kind of decided to go for Something very different! She was so kind, patient, creative, and helpful! She had different samples and examples of every aspect of the invitation. I have received so many compliments on how beautiful our invitations were since the wedding. Thank you Christa!

Look no further for all your paper needs! 

In a world of internet invites, there is something so special about receiving a beautiful paper invitation, and Christa is the one for the job. Her attention to detail is unsurpassed—she picks up on the minor details or changes that can often be overlooked. Christa took the extra time to cross-reference the addresses of my guests before sending them to print. I’m so grateful that she took that extra step because I did not give my addresses a second look before I sent them over. You can tell Christa loves what she does and will create beautiful paper goods! I am so lucky to have found Christa and will recommend her to all future brides!
