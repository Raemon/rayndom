Amazing views and food 

We couldn't be happier having our wedding at the University Club in April 2023. The moment we met Yvonne we knew that the University Club was the right venue for us. She is so friendly, knowledgeable and relatable. We knew that she was going to make our wedding wonderful with as little stress to us! Yvonne handled everything with ease and worked so well with our other vendors so our wedding day went flawlessly. Everyone at the University Club is so friendly and accommodating. The head bartender met with me the day before the wedding to make sure everything was perfect and she made sure I had a drink in my hand all night. The front desk staff are so helpful and made our guests feel welcome all weekend. Our guests still talk about the delicious food they had. The appetizers are amazing and the prime rib/salmon station was a huge hit. My personal favorite was the mushroom ravioli, we want to come back just for that ravioli! Everything is made onsite so the food is hot and timed perfectly with the evening. Being a more all inclusive site saved us so much hassle, not needing to worry about rentals and additional vendors showing up on time. Knowing they've done this so many times saved so much anxiety! For being an upscale venue in the heart of San Francisco, they are a very reasonably priced wedding venue, with no hidden fees at the end! Pick the University Club and dazzle your guests with delicious food and stunning views of San Francisco!

Magical Wedding in San Francisco

Amazing People, Amazing Venue, Amazing Wedding Food

I would highly recommend this gem of a venue. I loved working with the day of coordinator, Yvonne (my fairy day of coordinator should I say), throughout the wedding process. Let me also mention, everyone we talked to and worked with at the UC were just so beyond wonderful and helpful. The venue with the breathtaking skyline will surely blow your wedding guests away! AND THE FOOD!!! Okay, usually wedding food is never that good at a wedding....the food at the UC is amazing!!!!!!!! Everyone raved how delicious the food was and how it was the best wedding food they ever had.   
  
I don’t have any negative things to say about the University Club of San Francisco because having my wedding here really was the most positive experiences one could ever ask for. I really mean it when I say this is highly recommended!

Amazing location, incredible food, perfect vintage venue!!

We held our wedding reception at the University Club of San Francisco in July and are so glad we did! We couldn't have thought of a better venue to host our wedding reception; this included cocktail hour, buffet meal and dancing and drinks. This place is a hidden gem!  
  
Apart from the amazing interior and classic SF feel to the venue, we wanted a venue that would feel very 'San Francisco' since many of our guests were coming from the UK - the cable cars just outside, the black cat bar, the wooden panels, the view from the third and fourth floor balcony did exactly that.  
  
We had a really tight budget and this venue was exceptional value for money. It was really important for us to find a venue that had lots of inclusions rather than a blank canvas; being a couple from the UK we needed to make sure the venue was a stress free as possible so wanted somewhere that had venue coordination, linens, silverware, chairs, bar staff, on site catering - these guys pretty much had everything! Even down to the smaller details like candles, a cake stand and an easel for our seating chart.  
  
Yvonne was so helpful throughout the whole process, she is obviously very experienced and answered our questions at all hours no matter how big or small. She helped us put together a timeline and was there on the night itself to help co-ordinate everything.   
  
On the day itself we were safe in the knowledge that the room, the cake and our decorations would be set up perfectly and that the evening would run to time - we had nothing to stress or worry about and just enjoyed ourselves the whole night. The groom was even able to have getting ready shots in the library and the photos are just amazing.   
  
A special mention needs to go to the FOOD; our guests have not stopped talking about how amazing it was; notably the vegetarian buffet options and the Steamship Round! That's definitely a way to make the wedding guests happy!  
  
We really did have such a perfect wedding reception and were so impressed by the customer service, the final touches of the room set up, the dedication of the staff - our guests were so impressed by this stunning location, it is definitely a place to remember!

If we could get married (to each other) all over again, we would absolutely choose to do it at the University Club!

We’re so glad we decided to have our wedding at the University Club. It was a fantastic experience from start to finish. Here are some reasons why:  
-The planning and execution went really smoothly. Over the year leading up to the event, Yvonne answered our myriad questions and requests via email and during our walk-through and tasting. On the wedding day itself, everything went like clockwork. All the furniture, decorations, and food showed up in all the right places at the right times, and whatever behind-the-scenes machinery made that possible was virtually invisible to us and to the guests.   
\- The location is superb. It’s close to Union Square, but far enough to feel less urban and to offer some pretty iconic vistas along the adjacent cable car routes.   
-The views of the city skyline through the massive windows provided a magnificent backdrop to the ceremony, dinner, and reception. It made the whole event feel super open, and it was a special treat for our out-of-town guests. At times, it felt almost as if the dance floor was outside and we were floating among the highrises of FiDi.  
-The food was terrific. After hors d'oeuvres during the cocktail hour (potstickers strongly recommended!), we had a buffet dinner. Our guests loved everything -- from the salmon and prime rib to the roasted vegetables and cheese tortellini. They plated the appetizers and dinner for us, so we actually got to eat some of the food!  
-The space is clean, well furnished, and elegantly decorated. Between the main hall/dance floor, the balcony, the game room, the bar, and the library, there are so many great spots for guests to hang out in. Having a variety of areas made the reception especially vibrant and fun, and gave people plenty of options if they wanted to take a break from the dance floor.   
-Being able to have both the ceremony and reception in the same place, and being able to stay over and get ready in a room at the Club, was very convenient -- it allowed us to focus on the main activities and people of the day rather than worrying about transportation.  
  
All that said, there are a couple of areas for improvement:  
-Some of the guest rooms were outdated. While the beds are comfortable, the rooms can be loud due to cable cars outside or events (like weddings) upstairs   
-Parking can’t be booked in advance and is first-come-first serve for an additional fee. Every time you want to access your car you need to check out/return a remote-control gate opener.   
  
Overall, the pros FAR outweighed the cons. If we could get married (to each other) all over again, we would absolutely choose to do it at the University Club!

The University Club was the absolute perfect place for our wedding. The aesthetic, price and accommodating staff made it an unforgettable experience. 

Planning our wedding at the University Club was the best decision we could have made. Yvonne was responsive, friendly, organized and accommodating to our last-minute changes and requests. Nolan and the day-of front desk staff member were helpful and also responsive with assisting with a room block and day-of coordinating. The University Club is a beautiful venue and Yvonne and her team went above and beyond to ensure everything was set up properly. The day ran incredibly smoothly due to their attention to detail. The level of service and professionalism was outstanding, and the price was incredibly reasonable for their quality of work. Our guests loved the beautiful venue, the food and the space the University Club offered. They really made our day very special!

Elegant, fun, helpful, AMAZING

We got married at the University Club on June 15 this year and we honestly wish we could do it all again (okay, maybe minus the logistical stress) just so we could go back to the UClub and dance the night away! Having our wedding here (ceremony and reception) was without a doubt one of the best decisions we made. From the food (delicious! plentiful! seriously Bay Area restaurant-quality--not boring wedding food), to the space (vintage vibes, amazing views of the city, gorgeous library, and also shout-out to the beautiful wallpaper), to the staff (professional, organized, super communicative and responsive)--we could not have been more thrilled!  
  
A word on the staff here: Emily and Yvonne are rockstar coordinators and we were lucky enough to have both of them working the floor the day of our wedding! We had a very specific idea of what we were going for (vintage-tiki-glam), and brought in what felt to me like a lot of extra stuff (colored votives, tiki mugs, lots of paper goods and other personal touches). We also hired several vendors who had never worked an event at the UClub before (Helena and Laurent--photographers; Dart Collective--dj; The Alcatraz Islanders--live music). All of those things could have been super stressful or disorganized, but it was FLAWLESS. We talked a bunch with Emily before the wedding, met with her a couple times to walk through the space, and the day of, all we had to do was show up. My husband keeps saying that he felt like a guest at his own wedding, which I don't think is the norm, and speaks to the professional, calm, and organized (and fun!) demeanor of the staff here.  
  
Oh, and we had two specialty tiki cocktails and we sent Emily the recipes and the bartenders executed them PERFECTLY. When we went for our tasting, they made us both to try and gave us advice about one of them (maybe too strong) and we chose another recipe. They were stellar!  
  
A few other notable things (there are seriously so many!): Right after the cocktail hour as people were going downstairs to dinner, Emily brought us a plate of all the appetizers and our cocktails so that we could sit for a minute in the library and collect ourselves. This was SO APPRECIATED. A lot of the staff stayed late the night before setting up the space with all our decor, and it looked incredible when we came the next day. Seriously, I was blown away. We dropped off about a million colored votives and they had them (and all our other decorations) arranged beautifully around the whole space. There was a little snafu the week before the wedding with the number of linens I had ordered from La Tavola (this was my mistake, not the UClub's), and Emily and Yvonne took charge and took care of it and it was solved! (The UClub provides white linens but we wanted color which is the only reason we rented them.) They let us keep all our stuff in the coat room until Monday when we had time to go back and pick it up, which was a huge lifesaver and kept us from having to worry about it the night of our wedding. Oh, and she packed up boxes of cake for us to take with us at the end of the night, which was super thoughtful.  
  
Finally, I had a LOT of questions for Emily in the year leading up to the wedding, and she always answered them all thoughtfully, and the answers were essentially always, "Yes, that's great!" or "Yes, we can do that!" or "Yes, we'll take care of that for you!" I can't overstate how valuable her attitude and expertise were to us. She handled all the logistical things (eg: floorplans...I have no idea how to do that) and was enthusiastic and accommodating about all my ideas. In sum, we couldn't be happier to have gotten married at the University Club and we can't wait to start going to other events at the Club because we love it so much now!

Couldn’t have imagined a better wedding 

I should be relaxing on a beach enjoying my honeymoon in Maui right now but I had to write this review praising Emily and the rest of the university club team. Our wedding was truly the best day of my life and everything was handled with such precision and smoothness by the amazing Emily! I didn’t have to worry about a thing! Things guests raved about:   
1) the food wasnt just good for “wedding Food” — it was absolutely wonderful. People complimented us all night.   
2) the view is spectacular. Rain, shine or cloudy, you can’t beat the skyline. Out of town guests especially loved it.   
3) the venue itself is just so lovely and had so much charm. You really don’t need to add much decor.   
  
Things I loved:   
1) Emily is a lifesaver and a godsend! She literally took care of everything day of so I didn’t need a separate coordinator. She also kept us on track during the course of events.   
2) there are 2 floors so people can move around and there’s a great flow to the place   
3) the library was the perf place for photos   
4) the dramatic door opening for the bridal walk. Easily the best moment of the day — as a bride, it’s really magical to see all of your friends and family smiling at you in that moment.   
  
This is the perf venue if you’re:   
\- trying to be somewhat budget conscious   
\- want to wow your guests   
\- seeking a chill but guano atmosphere   
\- want delicious food   
\- want an absolutely beautiful showstopper wedding

Phenomenal

Yvonne, Yvonne, Yvonne. I can't stress enough how much she made our wedding the success it was - she thought of EVERYTHING and kept me so calm. She is simply amazing. I have no doubt she is the reason the club has such exquisite events and is the core of production. I hope you value her as much as we did (and still do!!!!).

Amazing experience all-around

We were recommended the University Club by a friend and couldn't be happier. First the venue itself is beautiful, perfectly located in the middle of San Francisco and offers breathtaking views of the city. We had a number of visitors from out of town and I think all of them took pictures of the city from the balcony. Second, the services provided by the University Club were top-notch. The food was amazing (we received multiple compliments, including from my uncle who doesn't like anything), there was never a line at the bar and so many little things were on point. Finally, and most importantly to us, the staff there was just perfect. Leading up to the day they answered questions, worked with our budget and had recommendations for vendors. Wedding planning is inherently stressful and the team at the University Club helped to keep that at a minimum. Then there was the day of. Just wow. Everything went so smoothly from start-to-finish. They did an amazing job of making the day magical for both of us This was one of the best decisions I have made in my entire life. Hands down.
