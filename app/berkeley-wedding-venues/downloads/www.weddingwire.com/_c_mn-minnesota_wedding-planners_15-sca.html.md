Hiring Sarah Trotter and Lasting Impressions was the best decision we made for our daughter’s wedding. Sarah was an absolute dream to work with and we couldn’t have done it without her. Her communication, professionalism and kindness allowed us to enjoy the wedding planning process without stress. Sarah listened to my daughter’s vision and created her dream wedding! On the big day, everything flowed seamlessly. We were able to be fully present and enjoy every moment, knowing Sarah and her team had everything under control. Sarah ensured every detail was perfect and we are forever grateful. We would whole heartedly recommend Sarah Trotter and Lasting Impressions for any couple wanting a beautiful and magical wedding!

We had such a great experience working with Leo Moon Events as our day-of-coordinator! Prior to the event, we received planning documents that helped us map out our ceremony and logistics we wouldn’t have otherwise thought of. On the day of the wedding, Bailey was our coordinator, and she was critical to making sure the event went smoothly. We had multiple vendors coming into our space, and Bailey made sure that everything went seamlessly with arrival and set-up. We also had an issue with our chair vendor, who forgot our order and showed up just before the ceremony; Bailey jumped right in to make sure the setup happened in time while we were taking family photos, and even set up some of the chairs herself. She also helped direct people from the main venue to the outdoor ceremony spot, making multiple back and forth trips in the rain to make sure everyone got there in time. Having Bailey there took a huge amount of stress off my partner, me, and our families, and we were able to just relax and enjoy the event. I highly recommend working with Leo Moon Events!

Bentley went above and beyond to help plan our special day. From the beginning, she provided amazing vendor recommendations for hiring, listened to our opinions and overall made the whole idea of planning a wedding A LOT less daunting. I can truly say that without her help, our day wouldn’t have been the same. From putting out the small “fires”, reassuring me that we were not running late from hair/makeup and communicating effectively with our vendors the day off; She truly is a wedding planning genius.

We hired Dos Goats about a year and a half ahead of our wedding and hired them for the day-of package. Adam, Christina, and Jory were all wonderful partners throughout our planning process and during the day-of. Perhaps the best value was Dos Goats' rental items -- we used their lanterns, candles, arches, and I think more? They made up a lot of our decor, and their options are always growing! The planning spreadsheets that they provide are very helpful, though they are a little daunting if you aren't mentally prepared. Some are a little redundant, but they are still a useful framework. Highly recommend their services, and we're grateful to have had them in our corner.

In the beginning, I only wanted Jess to be my day of coordinator but my mom talked me into the partial planning. Let me tell you... I was so relieved I was convinced to do so. You never realize how much actually goes into wedding planning. Jess alleviated all of my stress and she kept me on track over the 10 months of planning. We'd hop on planning calls and she would ask how I was and I would just have this deer in the headlights look on my face that screamed "NO!" lol By the end of the call, she'd follow up and ask the same question and I would feel so much better. This ain't her first rodeo... clearly... so I was so blessed to have her help. She was so on top of it. Even the day of, I wasn't asked a bunch of questions of where things go, etc.. It was just handled and executed beautifully! Thanks Jess!!! XO

Ashley was nothing short of AMAZING to work with. Due to COVID, we delayed our wedding a few times, and Ashley was so flexible, helpful, knowledgeable and encouraging throughout the process. We ended up completely changing our original plans and doing a small destination wedding in Vail, CO. Ashley created the most beautiful and memorable weekend for us. She truly is so talented and creative and everyone attending the wedding was simply blow away by the details and heart poured into the day. You will NOT be disappointed working with Ashley and her team - they are one of a kind! Thank you so much for creating us the most magical wedding weekend!

Holly was helpful in every way. She thought if so many things I hadn’t considered and had suggestions to make things easier and more affordable. She was incredibly responsive, has so much experience and was flexible. She made the day seamless and took care of all of the details behind the scene. I couldn’t imagine the day without her, she alleviated all the stress so we could be present and enjoy the day and our guests.

First, there is a true and very present reason why Jenna Culley Events has a 98% 5-star rating: they genuinely care about you and your event. JCE puts you first—always—and if something isn’t right, they will make it exactly the way you want it. They are with you every step of the way, through thick and thin. My team of planners started with me when I had almost no concrete ideas and stayed with me all the way to the last song…and even getting wine out of my wedding dress. They are a full-service team who quickly begin to feel like family. Communication is quick, kind, and incredibly helpful. You can tell that the entire JCE team wants everything to be exactly as it should be. During wedding week, my planner, Sara, and I were completely ready to rock and roll, and on the day-of she had every single detail handled. My only job was to be the bride, and Sara and her team took care of everything in sight—right down to having a drink ready for me the moment I walked in. They checked in not only on me, but also on my husband, my bridal party, my family, and even our other vendors. They truly are a super-team, and they made the day absolutely wonderful. I honestly wanted to take them all home with me! There are not enough words to describe how phenomenal the JCE team is. If you are looking for a wedding planner who will make your day stress-free, fun, seamless, and filled with support—as well as someone who becomes your personal cheerleader—this is the team you’re looking for. You will not regret it.

We were planning a wedding that had a mix of DIY and vendors, we needed help pulling everything together and getting organized the month and day-of. Meredith's demeanor and industry experience gave us so much confidence in her abilities and she executed our vision flawlessly. I was fully prepared to be running around like crazy on my wedding day and I can honestly say I felt zero stress, plus we received so many compliments on the decor and flow of the event and all of that wouldn't have been possible without her efforts. Thank you Meredith!
