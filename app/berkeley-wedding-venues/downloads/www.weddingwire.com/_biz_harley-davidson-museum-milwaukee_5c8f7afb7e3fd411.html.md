Perfect!!!

We were married and had our reception in Rumble at the Harley Davidson Museum on November 10th. Everything about the venue was amazing! From day one, our event coordinator Alex was wonderful. Alex, Elena and the entire staff did a fantastic job to ensure the big day ran flawlessly. The venue itself is beautiful! Rumble has an incredible view with floor to ceiling windows on one end. The museum and entire grounds offer great opportunities for pictures and fun. One of the main reasons we chose the Harley Museum was the food. It did not disappoint. The dinner was delicious. We even had a late-night mac-n-cheese bar that was a huge hit! All of our guests mentioned how great the venue was, and what an amazing choice we had made. I can’t express how happy we are with that choice. Thank you so much to Alex, Elena and the entire Harley Davidson Museum staff for making our special day perfect!

100% Amazing Experience! 

The Rumble room was so perfect and all of the staff that we worked with and the staff that worked our wedding reception were a complete joy! They were responsive, friendly and accommodating! It was the perfect venue for us. We took so many beautiful photos around the campus and a great time was had by all. We got lots of compliments on the space in Rumble, and the food!

Amazing Experience from Start to Finish 

We got married in October, and we chose the Chrome Room at the Harley-Davidson Museum as our venue. From the moment we met Alex at our tour of the room, she was on it. She always encouraged us to ask any questions that we had, replied to our questions promptly, and was readily available via both email or phone. We had several guests with dietary restrictions and she made sure to work with the chefs to ensure that everyone was able to eat their meal. At the tasting, the food was delicious...and at the actual wedding it was just as good if not even better! We were amazed that they were able to get everyone their meal fresh and hot...many guests came up to us after raving about the food! Our day-of coordinator was Theresa, and we loved her too! She helped us set up the menu cards, centerpieces, etc. and she was on top of anything that needed attention the night of the reception. She even helped us pack everything up at the end of the night! My husband and I absolutely loved working with Alex, Theresa, and the rest of the Harley staff. We definitely recommend choosing them as your wedding venue! Thank you again Alex and Theresa...you both are amazing!

We had our wedding ceremony and reception at The Harley Davidson Museum in The Garage on September 19th, 2014. From day 1 the staff was amazing and so easy to work with. Anne and Amy both helped plan out the event from start to finish and were truly wonderful. Amy our event coordinator for The Garage was absolutely amazing! Seeing as we couldn't get into the space the day before to decorate the florist, Amy, and the rest of the staff in The Garage helped make our day come to life. The result was the space looked AMAZING!!! Far better than our own expectations. We had the ceremony and reception in the same space and their turn around time to flip the room was rather quick to our surprise. If I would do it all over again I would definitely pick The Harley Davidson Museum as my vendor for any event, especially a wedding!!! I had the wedding of my dreams and then some and it couldn't have been possible if it wasn't for Amy, Anne, and the rest of The Harley Davidson Museum's wonderful and yet very attentive staff!

Beautiful venue

My husband and I met in downtown Milwaukee, and I really wanted our wedding to be located there. We loved that the various rooms at the Harley-Davidson Museum had such a distinct atmosphere, and that there was plenty of indoor and outdoor space to accommodate our guests. Also, on-site free parking was a big win! After meeting with Alex, and seeing all that Harley-Davidson had to offer, we made our decision to book Rumble for the big day. Alex and Jen assisted us in planning all the menu details and rearranging the floor plan multiple times. Everything went smoothly the day of, and we are so grateful to have had a great team behind us. We do wish that the venue had been able to offer a more flexible bar menu, and hope that a POS system is on the horizon for future brides.

We had a large wedding and The Harley Davidson Museum was a great venue for our wedding reception. Our day of contact, Tanya, was fantastic. She was so helpful and really did everything to make our day special. They were easy to work with and the food options are good. The day of service was fantastic.
