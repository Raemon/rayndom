We first found Simone when we were searching for an officiant for our destination wedding. We wanted something that would be customized and personal to us, not just a cookie cutter script. We had an initial phone call with her, where we asked her some questions and she asked us some questions, including our love story that brought us to our wedding. After the initial phone call, Simone wrote a draft of our ceremony and sent it to us to look over, and she nailed it! She picked up on core moments in our love story that were meaningful to us and integrated them into our ceremony. As I was looking into services she offered, I discovered that she also offered premarital counseling. This was something that was very important to me to have before marriage. I inquired and Simone gave an overview of the areas she covers during premarital counseling. She also offers this great service at a reasonable rate. We started counseling with Simone and went through a couple of the topics she covers in her program, but even more importantly, she was very open to helping us on current topics we wanted guidance on. We started our search in hopes of finding an officiant who would be open to customizing a ceremony that was personal to us and through the course of our counseling, we developed a friendship with Simone. The ceremony was absolutely perfect and we definitely felt like we were there with a friend!

David was exceptional. My bride/wife is from Nanjing China and he was so patient and kind to her. He arrived prompt, and delivered an incredible service/ceremony. He has a natural and compassionate voice and carries himself well while devoting his attention to the Bride and Groom on their special day. His focus is specific to your request and delivers with class. Thank you so much for being a part of our wedding!! John & Helen

Sherry at S G Productions is a seasoned professional! Her work is beautiful and she will put you right at ease not even knowing she is there. She knows just the perfect places and angles to get good video as well as all the little extras. She went above and beyond showing up at our rehearsal to ensure the camera placement, the correct lighting, and to get interviews. She was a true gem and we are proud to recommend her work to anyone looking for a videographer.

Jeff was great right from the beginning. He knew exactly what to do when and really helped us can our nerves. The amount of wedding guests that came up to me after the ceremony commenting how great Jeff was and he was so easy to hear and understand the whole time was endless. You could not pick a better officiant!
