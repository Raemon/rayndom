I’ve had the pleasure of working with Jansy for multiple events, and she never ceases to amaze me. Every single time, she goes above and beyond to make sure everything is flawless. The quality of the food is outstanding fresh, beautifully presented, and absolutely delicious. Guests always rave about the menu, and I love that she’s able to tailor everything to fit the occasion perfectly. Jansy’s creativity truly shines, not only in the food but also in her decorations and setups. Every detail is thoughtfully designed, and her eye for style transforms any space into something beautiful and inviting. She makes everything look effortless, yet the end result is stunning and memorable. Her professionalism, attention to detail, and genuine passion for what she does set her apart. Jansy makes the entire process seamless, stress-free, and enjoyable, which is exactly what you need when planning an important event. I can honestly say that her services elevate every celebration, and I wouldn’t trust anyone else. Highly recommend!

Leni, Nikki, Amy, and Chef Oscar provided a delicious and beautifully arranged spread for a first birthday this past weekend and it was everything we had imagined and more! From the very moment we contacted this team, their communication was clear, quick, and professional. They were very willing to work with us to provide on-theme, creative bites that tasted as good as they looked. The service was on-time, kept impeccably clean, and they provided a way for the client to take home leftovers at the end of the celebration. We will absolutely use this professional team again for future events!

Everything was beautiful!!! The presentation of the food was beautifully set, everything was super yummy and they even separated the buns for our gluten free guest! They went above and beyond for our event. They served with a smile on their face the whole time, very attentive. We are super thankful for them.

We had Cafe Ala Carte at our wedding at Living Sculpture Sanctuary in Davie, FL. They were easy to work with, had a very nice set up, and served delicious after dinner beverages at our wedding. Guests really enjoyed the selection they offered such as expressos & mixed coffee drinks. Would highly recommend them at your next event!

Naman's Catering was recommended to us by our venue's owners. They turned out to be better than we could've imagine. Not a single complaint was uttered, every one of our guests was saying how everything tasted delicious and would ask who catered. The staff was awesome too, they were so helpful throughout the night, always cleaning and making sure everything was just right. When we were planning with Naman's they made sure to leave no question unanswered and made us feel confident with the menu and how things would go on the big day. They even offered taste testing, one that was chef's choice since we didn't know what we wanted and didn't send them out specifics of what we wanted to try, and the 2nd was our menu we ended up building with them after the first tasting. They also allowed us to change a couple of the appetizers with how they are normally prepared and helped us figure out exactly what would go good. They were so nice and willing to go that extra mile to make sure we were happy and had a good night!

It was such a pleasure working with Eggwhites as our caterer. They were flexible, detail oriented, and true professionals. We know the difference they made because the day before at our rehearsal dinner, we had to manage everything w another caterer but the day of, Eggwhites seamlessly managed every aspect of the food, the catering, the drinks, the cake. Ann and her team didn’t leave out a single detail. They made sure to execute our floor plan perfectly. When we asked for a bigger portion and a less sweet cake, they delivered on those adjustments and more! Our guests raved about the food afterwards, and it was one of the most memorable aspects of the wedding!

Our experience with Arthur's Catering was absolutely fabulous. We had our destination wedding at the Sydonie Mansion, and Arthur's came highly recommended to us from our planner as she used them for her own wedding. We are a family of restauranteurs from New Jersey, so food was the #1 most important thing for us at our wedding, and let me tell you, the food and service has been one of the most complimented things from our guests about the day!! We specifically worked with Diego and he was the BEST!!! He was not only beyond accommodating, knowledgeable and helpful with constructing our menu, but he was also so friendly and fun to work with - something you don't get with every vendor during the wedding planning process! From the moment we came to Arthur's for our first tasting they made us feel like royalty and it made us so happy to hear that our guests felt the same way. Beyond the food and service being exceptional, it was super convenient (and fun!) to be able to pick out all of our flatware, glassware and linens right there at Arthur's location. A huge thank you to Diego and everyone at Arthur's for exceeding our wildest dreams and being such a big part of our perfect day!!!

Jaimz is the absolute best! She is professional, on top of things, has very creative ideas and is very resourceful! The catering was phenomenal too! Jaimz made sure everything looked perfect and refilled through the event, those plates were never empty! I highly recommend working with Big City Catering!
