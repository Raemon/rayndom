Amazing, friendly, and professional! 

We met Erin at a Bridal Show and loved her designs. Erin helped us create a theme with our fall wedding and colors that really set the tone for the rest of the wedding celebration! We had beautiful magnet save the dates, elegant invitations, great signage and programs for day of, and cute thank yous.  
  
We are so glad we went with Dot and Bow Paperie, and would recommend it to everyone. Besides the great quality, Erin was incredible to work with and responded to all our requests in a timely and creative manner.

The Dream Team!

Working with Erin and Chris was just a blessing. They made gorgeous invitations, thank you cards, programs and signage for MY budget. These ladies brought my dream to reality the time-frames were transparent, never late, never off and never over budget. If you are looking for talented, creative, and helpful wedding team this is the place and the people to work with

Quality is Their Specialty

To say that I am impressed with this company would be a true understatement. They designed an invitation better than I even envisioned, were extremely professional by providing a timeline when everything would be done by, and then went above & beyond to deliver faster than anticipated. I could not have been happier with the service, quality, and experience I received from this company. I highly recommend Dot & Bow Paperie! :)

Most Beautiful Invitations

Katy at Dot & Bow did an amazing job with our wedding invitations. She did a great job customizing our invitations, and the other items we purchased, to make sure they fit our theme. I would recommend them to anyone!

To be honest I know the people that work here, however now that I am finally a Bride and I actually get the chance to work with them, I have more respect for them than ever. I love that I am able to actually go into their shop, meet with a consultant, and see/touch their work! Erin & Chris at dot & bow are absolutely amazing and help me easily understand what I can get within my budget. Erin is a gifted designer, her attention to detail is astounding, and her skills are incredible, not to mention she listens to me and we collaborate on what I want. They offer a certain sophistication in everything that they do, and I highly recommend them.

Our invites from Dot & Bow were one of our favorite things about the wedding! We had a rustic themed wedding in a barn and they provided the PERFECT invitations to set the scene for it. I cannot begin to tell you how many compliments we received about them. The staff was great to work with! They were able to provide recommended wording, but were flexible enough to also let us do what we wanted, and even provide some additional recommendations. Pricing was comparable to other websites and we spent a little more than we wanted, but for what we got in return it was totally worth it.
