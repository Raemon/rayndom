Chateau de Courtomer was truly a dream come to life for our wedding in October! Where to begin! We had a destination wedding with 55 guests over the course of three days and it was truly the most magical experience for both us and all of our guests. The week proceeding the wedding, we stayed at the chateau with 14 of our immediate family members for the most lovely pre-wedding vacation. The chateau itself is incredibly beautiful. It has been lovingly restored and is perfectly maintained. It has the grandness and beauty that comes with being a chateau in the French countryside, but somehow, also manages to feel cozy and comfortable, like a real home and a perfect place for an intimate family gathering. The rooms were so gorgeous and comfortable, and the entire place was outfitted and stocked for a perfect weeklong stay. We loved that each room had its own bathroom, that we had access to a washer and dryer, and there was a room on the ground floor for my grandmother with limited mobility. The staff and team at the Chateau were so wonderful to work with. The were responsive and incredibly helpful- from recommending vendors to things to do in the area- they made our stay all the more comfortable. For the wedding itself, the chateau and grounds were perfect and very flexible to have multiple events over the course of the weekend that all felt different. We utilized every bit of space, including the charming Orangerie for our ceremony and dancing + dessert reception and it was beyond gorgeous. Our guests were all in awe of how beautiful but also welcoming the property felt, and we felt like we were living in a dream. We chose most of our wedding vendors from the chateau’s recommendations and every single person we worked with was so kind and professional and amazing at their job. I would highly recommend all of the vendors we chose from the chateau’s recommendation! We had the rest of our guests stay at a nearby hotel in Mortagne-au-perche, again at the suggestion of the chateau, and they all loved both the hotel and the town with plenty to do and eat in the area. We had people traveling in from all over the globe, so the location couldn’t have been better. It was an easy and quick drive or train ride from Paris which made it so convenient! Insider tip: ask for Chef Franck and Jane- you won’t be disappointed! It was an absolute dream to have our wedding at Chateau de Courtomer and we can’t wait to one day return!
