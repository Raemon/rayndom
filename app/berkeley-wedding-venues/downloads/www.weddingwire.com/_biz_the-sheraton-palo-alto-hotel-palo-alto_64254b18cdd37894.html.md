Professional, Friendly, and Flexible

I had a wonderful experience planning my wedding with the Sheraton Palo Alto. Kristina Tobin (the Events Manager) is a top notch professional, as well as warm, humorous, and flexible. She is extremely knowledgeable and works closely with you to bring your vision of your special event to life. I was continuously impressed by her knowledge, patience, suggestions, and flexibility throughout our planning discussions. The extended staff (chef, banquet manager, etc) were all equally warm, engaging, and honest about what would work ideally with my vision. They have a 3 room setup (ballroom, dance floor with glass atrium ceiling, and cocktail area) all side by side for seamless transitions of your guests from one function to the next. The hotel premises are elegant and kept meticulously clean inside and out by the hardworking friendly staff. The complimentary parking and competitive rates truly sweetened the deal. I would highly recommend the Sheraton Palo Alto and especially Kristina Tobin to anyone considering a wedding in the South Bay area!

Kristina Tobin was awesome!

We had our wedding reception at the Sheraton Palo Alto this past July, and Kristina Tobin was our wedding coordinator at Sheraton. She was definitely one of the best vendors we've worked with. She was not only incredibly professional, she was also very friendly and kind.   
She accommodated all of our requests, and made our wedding reception exactly the way we envisioned. During the entire process, Kristina also gave quite a bit of tips and suggestions to make our planning smoother. We are super grateful for everything she has done, and we highly recommend this venue and Kristina!

I would give this venue the highest marks! My husband and I had our wedding there in May of 2017 and we were on a seriously tight budget. Kristina Tobin and her team made everything absolutely perfect that day. She helped coordinate all my other vendors, guided us through the whole process and made it seriously stress free! I couldn't have dreamt of it going any better. The food was excellent, the space was beautiful, and everything was perfect! Thanks to Kristina for making our wedding day one we will never forget!

We had our wedding reception at Sheraton Palo Alto Hotel after a wedding ceremony at Stanford Memorial Church. The location is so convenient and our wedding coordinator Kristina Tobin was amazing. She really understood what we were looking for and helped us make every single detail perfect for the day, from the layout of the tables to all the details of the room decorations. For catering, we went with the Hibiscus Wedding Package. It was of great value and has all we need covered. Food was delicious too. We got tons of positive feedback from our guests, especially on the Half Moon Bay Baked Cod. Overall the day was a great success. We would truly like to say "Thank You" to Kristina Tobin for making it a sweet memory for us.

I can’t say enough things about Kristina Tobin, who handles the special events at the Sheraton. She went above and beyond for our wedding (which coincided with a day of record high temperatures!) and her years of experience were invaluable throughout the whole process.   
  
Leading up to the day, she was professional, prompt, and answered our endless questions via email and phone calls. Starting from our initial meeting where we described our vision, she gave us a breakdown of costs, showed us a second room which had not initially considered (which we ended up choosing!), and gave us all of our options. Because we weren’t exactly sure how we wanted the day would look, it was really helpful to get Kristina’s experience with different events.  
  
The venue and packages offered by the hotel were perfect for our reception after a ceremony at the Stanford Memorial Church. Our 120 person wedding was hosted very comfortably in the Justine’s Ballroom, Piazza Courtyard, and Oak/Sequoia trifecta, with the cocktail hour in Oak/Sequoia, the banquet dinner in Justine’s, and dancing in Piazza. We really enjoyed the synergies offered by holding our reception at a hotel - all of our out-of-town guests were staying there, they had extra rooms for changing, and we had to bring very little (they even provided cups and hot water for our tea ceremony!). Our guests loved the open pool, especially during the heatwave!  
  
On the day of, Kristina was fantastic. She helped put up all of our decorations along with our wedding coordinator, put out a fire when we had accidentally ordered fewer chairs than guests (eek!), and seamlessly addressed a situation where a guest we hadn’t planned for showed up (we got lucky and he was able to have the meal of someone who was sick). It really is the little touches, like moving the cake out of the hot dance floor so it doesn’t melt. Nothing but positive comments for Kristina.

We enjoyed working with Kristina. She is very accommodating and helped organize our wedding event well. Our wedding rehearsal and event went smoothly. We chose the right banquet room to accommodate the amount of our wedding guests. The hotel lend us their platform and arch for our wedding event. My guests enjoyed the cold and warm appetizers and entrees provided by the hotel. The appetizers and meals arrived in a timely manner with no delays. Kristina reminded us about the cake cutting time when we were busy taking wedding photos with our guests. The hotel let us use their champagne glasses and wedding cake cutting knife. I highly recommend reserving your future wedding event at Sheraton Palo Alto with Kristina as your wedding specialist.

We chose to host our reception at the Sheraton Palo Alto back in February of 2017. Kristina was an absolute pleasure to work with. We chose to handle our reception as more of an informal party and as such we depended on Kristina to be flexible with our needs. Kristina explained the packages they have clearly and valued our time while preparing. The event went better than we could have ever hoped. My wife and I absolutely recommend Kristina and the Sheraton Palo Alto.  
  
Friends of ours recommended the venue and Kristina by name and we are very very happy we chose to work with them for our reception.

We are glad that we have chosen Sheraton Hotel to host our wedding ceremony this summer. Kristina Tobin (Wedding Specialist from Sheraton Hotel) was very detailed oriented and responsive. She always responded our email even after office hour. We had changed our seating arrangement several times (near the wedding date), and she handled our request patiently. We were very nervous about our wedding ceremony (due to a lot of last minute arrangements), and we are glad that we had Kristina to help to with our wedding! She's such a life saver!

This review is for Kristina Tobin, who helped coordinate our wedding reception here.  
  
Kristina is hands down the main reason we picked the Sheraton for our wedding reception! (That, and of course also how beautiful the Sheraton is!) You’ll see all these previous reviews her just about Kristina herself - and that’s for good reason! She was simply amazing all through the process, from early planning stages to helping us make sure everything is in place on the day-of. We met with Kristina multiple times in the planning months to go through every small detail. We're obviously new to the whole wedding planning process and Kristina, with her many MANY years of experience, really helped guide us through it - even many of the non-Sheraton-related matters. Her attention to detail, warmth, friendliness, and professionalism, really made our whole process, and beautiful day-of, such amazing memories.  
  
We had our reception in the aptly-named Reception Room at the Sheraton, and it was simply beautiful. We had quite minimal decoration, and it wasn’t needed because the room is beautiful by itself! We had 70 guests, and it was a great fit - not too crowded, not too empty. The food was absolutely delicious - the hors d’oeuvres, the dinner, and the drinks - we received so many compliments on them!  
  
Kristina, THANK YOU so much for everything you did for us, and we're SO happy to have a new friend in our lives! We’re so incredibly lucky to have had you help us through the entire process and planning for our reception, creating such amazing memories for us and our guests, and we wholeheartedly recommend her and the Sheraton to anyone planning their wedding!
