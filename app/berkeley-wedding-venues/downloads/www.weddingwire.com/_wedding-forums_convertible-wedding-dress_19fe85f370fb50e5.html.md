Hello all! I am a non-traditional bride tbh. I am wanting a black wedding dress in particular and was thinking about doing a convertible option. I love the ball gown and a line dresses but thats probably going to be too much for the reception. Has anyone done a convertible dress before? Howd it go? I know I could just change into a different dress but I am nervous about that due to time and space. Let me know your thoughts please! Thank you!

You can also find long and short dresses with a detachable overskirt. The difficulty though may be finding that in black or having one customized to black.

I was thinking about having a short dress underneath and the overskirt making it a ball gown. I need to find someone who can customize it.

I'm a costume designer find a wedding dress you love and have it dyed black. Having a detachable skirt will be your easiest option. With the main part of the dress being longer or shorter, mermaid, or a line, whatever style you want underneath but then you can have the voluptuous ball gown on top.

A convertible wedding dress can be a great solution, giving you the drama of a ball gown for the ceremony and the comfort of a simpler style for the reception, all without needing a full outfit change or extra space.
