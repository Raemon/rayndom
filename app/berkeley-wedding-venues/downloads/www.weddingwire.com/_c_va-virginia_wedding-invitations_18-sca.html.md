I can't express enough how delighted I am with the exceptional work done by Heather at Rock Paper Scissors of Charlottesville. VA. From the moment we first discussed my wedding vision, Heather demonstrated not only a deep understanding of my desires but also an unparalleled ability to bring those dreams to life through her stunning designs. Every piece of wedding stationery she crafted—from the elegant save-the-dates to the intricately designed wedding invitations, thoughtfully detailed signage, personalized matches, beautifully arranged wedding programs, and the welcoming booklet—was nothing short of perfection. The attention to detail was remarkable, and it was evident that Heather poured her heart and soul into each creation. What truly set Heather apart was her ability to capture the essence of our wedding theme and translate it into cohesive, breathtaking designs. She was incredibly attentive, always receptive to feedback, and quick to offer creative solutions that enhanced our original ideas. Her dedication to making sure every piece was perfect and seamlessly tied together was evident throughout the entire process. The quality of the materials and the craftsmanship of each item exceeded our expectations. The paper was luxurious, the printing immaculate, and the finishing touches were exquisite. Our guests were in awe of the beautiful stationery, and many commented on how unique and elegant everything looked. Additionally, Heather's professionalism and timeliness were greatly appreciated. She kept us informed at every stage, met all deadlines, and ensured that everything arrived in perfect condition. I am beyond grateful for the outstanding work that Heather did for our wedding. She made our special day even more memorable with her exceptional talent and dedication. If you are looking for someone to create stunning, personalized wedding stationery that will leave a lasting impression, I wholeheartedly recommend Heather at Rock Paper Scissors of Charlottesville, VA. Thank you for making our wedding vision a beautiful reality!

I very happily drove an hour to Richmond from Williamsburg to use Papeterie based off their reviews and I was not disappointed. They were prompt in their responses, gave great ideas about design, their execution was totally on point, and worked so hard along with me to come in UNDER budget rather than right at or over. Very pleased with their work on our programs, menus and invitations and details cards.

Kristin is fabulously talented, down to earth, and a joy to work with. She helped us custom design wedding invitations to go with our "Virginia Wedding" theme. She did this beautiful Dogwood flower design and combined it with a beautiful bronze and brown ink to go with our fall tones. She put it up as a sample on her website and, although they look nice there, the photos don't do it justice! Letterpress is certainly a lost art that goes under appreciated in this day and age since it is generally much more expensive than standard printing. The end product she presented us with was well worth the value! One thing I loved was that she was very flexible with us. Since my husband and I are both creative types, we had a lot of input. She worked well with us and was able to incorporate everything we wanted into what the letterpress process could do. She even came to us and had us look at all the sample papers and ink swatches she had to make sure we got what we wanted. I just wish I had sprung for the extra few bucks and had her make Thank You cards with pre (letter pressed) return-addressed envelopes. It would have been so helpful!!

My fiance and I just sent out our invitations a week ago, and we could not be more pleased with Jen's work! She was an absolute joy to work with, and we are getting so much positive feedback from our guests on how beautiful the invites are. We are so happy that we got Jen to do some keepsake envelopes for us, because her work is truly a work of art. We can't wait for Jen to do our escort cards!

Cary was a dream to work with for designing and making our wedding invitations. We couldn't have imagined anything out of the box to truly convey what we wanted and Cary was so good at listening, really hearing our desires, offering beautiful design possibilities and making sure our invitations felt like US. We were so happy with the whole experience and received so many compliments from our family and friends on our invitations which are a work of art, thanks to Cary. She's organized, professional, highly skilled, warm, caring and creative. We highly recommend her work, with confidence.

I was somewhat disillusioned with invitation companies in having to pick styles from a myriad of books that all ended up looking the same to me after awhile. I was intrigued that Eva Petersen custom designed her material and scheduled a meeting. Eva was a breath of sunshine for me and took the time to understand what I liked, disliked and wanted to convey for the first impression of what the wedding would be like. Her design was classic, but modern, yet with a touch of old world whimsical. We had some struggles with printing in gold on my paper selection, but Eva’s suggestion proved to be the best option. I still remember hearing the recipients comment to me (unsolicitedly)that if the invitation was any indication of how the wedding would be like, that it would the event of the year. Many picked up on the old world with a touch of modernism, which surprised me because I didn’t think that people noticed as much as they did. I also remember that my mother-in-law had not yet received the invitation herself in Spain and yet her friends that had, called her to tell her how beautifully elegant it was. In fact all of the printed materials from Eva were unique and of excellent quality and her patience was unwavering, especially when it came time to makes specific knots and glue peacock feathers. We were able to subtly carry the peacock theme throughout the wedding and I could not have been happier with the result. Eva truly is a master of her trade, sacrificing everything for products that are totally one of a kind at an affordable price.

My husband and I cannot praise PaperFreckles enough! They created a customized "fairytale" book for us based on our life in Manhattan. They were quick to respond and always willing to go through several drafts until it was perfect. We will always treasure these invites and they are truly a work of art. Please use them for something beyond the usually invite. They are creative, highly-skilled and very professional. They are also affordable for a highly-customized product. They are VERY LGBT-friendly and a definite must for same-sex couples. Beautiful work and excellent customer service

We were looking for a unique invitation that truly captured who we are and our vision for our wedding, something that was elegant yet non traditional. Brei worked patiently with us from start to finish and created something that was truly unique, that most of our invitees have never seen before. We strongly recommend Brei to anyone who wants a touch of creativity and style in their wedding invitations.
