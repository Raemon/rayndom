Leandra is an incredible singer. She sang at my wedding, and her performance was absolutely beautiful. Not only does she have a stunning voice, but she was also punctual, professional, and incredibly patient. She listened carefully to my requests and truly understood what I wanted for such an important day. Her singing was so moving that it brought me to tears. I am beyond grateful to have had her as part of my wedding and would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a talented and thoughtful singer

Musical Heart Strings was absolutely the perfect choice for live music during our ceremony and cocktail hour at Trentadue Winery. The planning process was seamless and their professionalism was excellent. Could not recommend them more! Thanks Musical Heart Strings!

Not only did Eliana strings play beautifully at our wedding, Maya was also an absolute pleasure to work with. Very responsive and friendly during the entire process. Also, completely open to playing songs that were special to my wife and I that were not in the song book. They were a huge hit at our wedding. We got so much great feedback from our guests about how incredible they sounded. I am so happy that we booked them and would recommend to any other couple that would like live music at their wedding.

We had the absolute pleasure of working with Brian for our wedding day, and we couldn’t be happier with the experience. From the very beginning, he was kind, patient, and incredibly knowledgeable. We truly appreciated all of his thoughtful recommendations—he helped guide us through the music selection process with ease and made everything feel stress-free. On the day of the wedding, his performance was absolutely beautiful and added the perfect touch of elegance to our ceremony. Our guests are still talking about how stunning the music was. We’re so grateful to have had him be part of our special day. Highly recommend! 💕🎶

Organic String Quartet made our wedding ceremony and cocktail hour absolutely unforgettable; we still get chills thinking about it! Hiring them was one of the easiest and best decisions we made for the entire day. They arrived early, took the time to rehearse with our church organist, and were incredibly warm and professional from the first email to the last note. We asked them to learn “Cornfield Chase” from Interstellar by Hans Zimmer (something completely new to their repertoire), and they performed it with such emotion and precision that it felt like the soundtrack was written just for us. Walking down the aisle to that piece, played live by these amazing musicians, is a memory we’ll treasure forever. A funny little behind-the-scenes moment: while the groom and groomsmen were getting ready in the back room, someone’s phone alarm started going off like crazy. The quartet (who could clearly hear it through the walls) immediately started playing the softest, most beautiful filler music to mask the sound so it never reached the guests or disrupted the ceremony. We didn’t even know it happened until later; that kind of awareness and quick thinking speaks volumes about how much they care. Alicia was an absolute dream to work with; responsive, patient, organized, and genuinely excited for us. She guided us through song selections and made the whole process stress-free. If you want live music that will elevate your wedding to another level and musicians who go above and beyond in every way, look no further than Organic String Quartet. We feel so lucky we found them. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!

Krista was our harpist for our San Francisco City Hall wedding. She is on the approved list of vendors and we were so ecstatic that she was available for our time and date. She checked in with us on what kind of music we wanted her to play for the ceremony and she even learned to play the animal crossing theme song as part of the process! We were so thrilled with her harp playing and would highly recommend her to anyone that wants a harpist for their wedding or event!

We hired Jay to play for my ceremony and cocktail hour. He was easy to work with. I appreciate the meeting before our wedding date so our songs and the format for the wedding ceremony was all squared away. It helped! Great guitarist and played beautifully especially for our special song, thank you jay!

I hired Amy to perform at a private formal dinner for donors. Her enchanting music added the exact charm I wanted for this intimate gathering of community members. Amy's abundant rolodex allowed her to tailor her music to fit the vibe of this event. She was super flexible and willing to learn new material for the evening! Amy was very quick to respond and easy to work with. I would love to work with Amy again in the future and recommend for her to play at your event, big or small!

We booked Jason Sulkin Music for a saxophone and guitar duo to play during the cocktail hour at our wedding, and it was one of the best decisions we made! Jason and his team are incredibly talented musicians, and their performance was absolutely stunning. Our guests couldn’t stop raving about how beautiful the music was—it elevated the entire atmosphere and set the tone for the rest of the night. Working with Jason was a dream. He’s professional, flexible, and made everything so seamless. His extensive music selection made it so much fun for my husband and me to choose our favorite songs. Jason handled all the details, leaving us stress-free and confident that everything would be perfect—and it was. I can’t recommend Jason enough! I will absolutely be hiring him again for a party at my house.

I've always loved the elegance and beauty of music played on the harp and was so excited to find a harpist who was not only talented, but was SO easy to work with. She learned new songs that I wanted for my ceremony and played them BEAUTIFULLY. She was very kind, punctual, and professional. If you envision a harp on your wedding day, I can't recommend her enough!
