I am so happy to have had Glow to Beauty part of my wedding day and for making me and my bridesmaids look and feel gorgeous. Having my hair & makeup done was a new experience for me, but from the consultation to my big day, Bethany made me feel so comfortable and heard each time she did my makeup. She was always easy to get in touch with and answered every question I had throughout the entire process.

April did my hair for my courthouse elopement. I have a medium to short length bob which had me worried that there wasn’t much we could do with my hair to make me feel beautiful. April is such a pro, she did an amazing job! She was also reliable, flexible, timely and responsive. But what made everything even better is how sweet she is! I thoroughly enjoyed my time in her chair and would 100% recommend.

Samantha and her team did my hair and makeup for my mother, six bridesmaids, and myself on September 24th. We did our trial two days before because she was accommodating that this was a destination wedding for us! She willing ran long on the trial to make sure I was good with every detail and made me feel completely comfortable. She had plenty of recommendations to ensure we were covered for the day of. I loved the high end products she used, and she had professional recommendations to ensure the longevity of my hair and make up. I came away from my trial very excited for the wedding. Her whole team showed up on the wedding day completely prepared and early. But the best part was the fun, uplifting, attitude they brought. They made each person feel excited to be in the chair and beautiful with the outcome. They are genuinely happy to be there and are so kind and complementary. My mother is the type who is never happy with her hair or makeup, and this is the first time she has ever said “I feel beautiful like this”. That was such a special moment for me- my mother and I so happy and confident. Sam and her amazing team made that happen for us. For me that is priceless. Plus everyone’s makeup stayed on through all the many happy tears. I have no clue how my lashes and mascara stayed on as I sobbed through my vows. I could not recommend this team enough.

Ashley did my wedding makeup in July of 2016. I couldn't have asked for a better makeup artist! She was professional, courteous, and so sweet. Definitly calmed my nerves the day of my wedding - if you're looking for a makeup artist in Louisville Ky I highly recommend!

Mollie visited my location bringing her own lighting and a cart of her tools. She gave me a wonderful updo that held all wedding and dancing the night away in spite of a dreary rainy day. She was super flexible and worked with the needs of my older skin giving me crease free foundation. She truly listened and gave me exactly what I wanted and guided me when I didn’t have a clue. She gave me a glamorous look without taking it over the top. I wish I could have her fix my hair and face all the time!

As someone who is into makeup, hair and makeup were the first vendors on my list to book. Lauren was probably the first person I booked! I trust her implicitly on a wide range of styles and she knocked it out of the park for my wedding party. I recommend her to everyone!

Very professional, punctual and creative. Nikki was able to create that perfect style to really pull my whole wedding day look together. I booked her for my engagement photo shoot, wedding day trial run and wedding day. She exceeded my expectations at every booking!

I used Rebecca for makeup for our engagement photos. She did an amazing job!! I've had so many people ask me who did my makeup. It lasted all day and still looked great 12 hours later for dinner! I would recommend anyone to go to her!
