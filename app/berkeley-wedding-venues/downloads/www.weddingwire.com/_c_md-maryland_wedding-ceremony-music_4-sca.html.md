5.0 

I can't say enough good things about Purvi's professionalism, dedication to her craft and how my wedding day entrance turned out! She sang a song that was special to both my husband and I while I walked down the aisle. Prior to the wedding day she met with me to discuss my vision, music options, and even created a special track to go with her voice. Everyone also commented on how beautiful her voice sounded and thought it was a soundtrack! 10/10 would recommend her to anyone wanting something a little different for their wedding or reception festivities, she can do it all!

Gabbi was extremely helpful and easy to work with, and a great personality to have on your wedding day. She had a solid selection of music to choose from, and hit the ground running the day of. She worked well with setting up with our coordinator and DJ, so we didn’t have to worry about anything and could focus on our wedding ceremony. The peace of mind was so great. We loved having her play at our wedding! She is very talented and we received positive feedback from the guests listening to her play prior to the ceremony.

Elegant Fiddle (Yalira) was absolutely incredible!!! My husband and I had booked Yalira for a January 2026 wedding in the DMV area; however, due to a unforeseen situation, we unexpectedly had to change our wedding location and move up our wedding date to July 2025. Yalira was so flexible and accommodating as we navigated this big change in our plans, and Yalira graciously traveled all the way to Virginia Beach to play at our ceremony. The cost was very reasonable/affordable, and Yalira was easy to work with and very professional. Yalira is also extremely talented and able to play a vast number of songs! Our wedding processional in the sand felt absolutely magical while Yalira played “Can't Help Falling in Love”, and Yalira also played our first dance song and a song for a father-daughter dance. I will never forget dancing on the beach to such beautiful music by Elegant Fiddle. Yalira really made our wedding ceremony that much more memorable and special, and we would hire Yalira again in a heartbeat! I cannot recommend Elegant Fiddle enough.

So glad we chose this duo for our daughter’s wedding. Their musicianship was excellent for both the ceremony and cocktail hour and they switched into DJ mode for the rest of our event. They were totally prepared, had plenty of equipment for the various places and kept in touch throughout the process. All our guests were very happy with the classy and touching acoustic music and enjoyed all the party music as well. Great way to go for all your music needs with no compromises. 10/10 would use them again!

We decided to hire a string quartet relatively late and were very grateful Two Rivers was available on the date of our wedding. They were so easy to work with. They had a great repertoire of music to play for the prelude of our ceremony, and we provided the music for our two processional songs, which they executed flawlessly. They were so professional, communicative, and clearly know what they're doing, adapting on the fly to lengthen our processional songs since our walks took longer than expected! They definitely helped make our ceremony special.

I had a small, intimate wedding with 50 guests on the Eastern Shore in Maryland on July 8th. The setting was perfect for Orlando to do what he does so well! He played his steel drum for our outdoor ceremony overlooking the water and it was perfect! Afterwards he entertained my guests with mellow caribbean style music that was also perfect! If you get the chance to check out any of his live shows, you definitely should. Orlando will have you jamming in no time.

Stephen was so easy to work with. He was ready to learn new songs if we wished. And he was flexible - he even played during the downpour on our wedding day!

Anastasia was absolutely wonderful to work with and an amazing addition to our wedding ceremony. She was extremely responsive, flexible, and plays the harp beautifully. Having a vendor you can trust is so comforting on an otherwise stressful day. I would HIGHLY recommend Anastasia for any event in which you want to include beautiful music.
