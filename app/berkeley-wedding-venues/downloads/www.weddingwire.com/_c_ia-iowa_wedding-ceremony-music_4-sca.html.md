We could not have been happier with Cole Thomas and Random Nature! From start to finish, they were incredibly professional, responsive, and easy to work with. They made the entire process stress-free and went above and beyond to make our wedding day unforgettable. The music was amazing—the dance floor was packed all night, and our guests are still talking about how great the band was. They read the crowd perfectly, kept the energy high, and seamlessly transitioned between songs and sets. Every member of the band was talented, friendly, and clearly passionate about what they do. If you’re looking for a band that’s organized, fun, and genuinely cares about making your event special, we can’t recommend Cole Thomas and Random Nature enough. They truly made our night!

I found Enjoy with Troy through WeddingWire and don't regret it! I had always imagined having a pianist at my wedding and Troy did not disappoint. He was very easy to work with and I was able to trust him very easily. He took any challenge I threw at him, including him learning two new and fairly difficult songs for my ceremony! Troy is a very polite and pleasant man who has a passion for what he does. I am so glad that we found him!

We hired Grace Notes flute Quartet to play during our ceremony and cocktail hour. Karen was easy to contact and answered all our questions. She scoped out the venue a few weeks before hand to make sure she knew where they would need to set up. She talked with the venue coordinator and had everything figured out. All I had to do was pick what songs I wanted and they did the rest. Because of COVID, Grace Notes Flute Quartet could only offer a Trio for our wedding. This was ok because Karen took the difference off in price and they still sounded amazing! They even wore special mask, which made me chuckle a little. But this still did not diminish their sound. Our guest loved the sound of live peaceful music. We were able to choose from a variety of different songs and we were able to request songs too. They sounded beautiful and I would definitely recommend them!

Glenn Henriksen is an exquisitely talented musician. He entertained our wedding guests all afternoon through our reception with his extensive repetoire of classical and show tunes. More important than his musicianship, however, is his gracious demeanor. Glenn spoke with many of our guests personally. His kindness and talent made our wedding day even more special. We were honored to have him come.

He did such a great job with all of the song that he played, he really is a phenomenal bagpiper. He was so easy to work with and if he didn't now a song he was more than willing to learn how to play it. I will recommend him to anyone and everyone who would like to have a bagpiper.
