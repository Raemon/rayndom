The Perfect Ceremony

What the Pluck went above and beyond for our ceremony. They played when guests arrived and for the processional/recessional. They were easy to get in touch with, had an extensive list of songs, and even offer to arrange music that they do not already have in their library. They played beautifully and helped set the perfect ambience.

The best addition to our ceremony!

We booked a VERY last minute wedding celebration in April 2025, and as a musician myself, I know I wanted a quartet to entertain guests as they arrived and during our ceremony. Not only did What the Pluck learn two new songs for us, but they learned my own composition that I wrote for my wife, and I played keyboard alongside them, it was an incredible experience! They offered to play longer than originally scheduled, and all the guests LOVED their arrangements, from Taylor Swift, to Coldplay, to Beyonce. I HIGHLY recommend them for your next wedding or formal engagement!

Beautiful Music for a Perfect Day

We couldn’t be happier with What the Pluck! We used them for our wedding ceremony on 8/10/25 and it was absolutely amazing. Their music added such an elegant touch to the day and it truly set the tone from the moment guests arrived. Everyone is still talking about how beautiful they played and how much it elevated the entire atmosphere. Highly recommend!
