Where do I even begin?! Having a great videographer was one of the most important aspects of our wedding - Aaron and Jamie exceeded our expectations. If you want to share your most special moments with anyone, choose this team. They were so friendly and fun to be around, I genuinely enjoyed the time we spent together! They made us feel comfortable and confident. They were filled with great ideas and were amazing at capturing all the best shots in the least amount of time, so that you can actually enjoy your wedding! I could go on and on; thank you, The Film Perspective, we can’t wait to see the final product!

Brandon puts together a team of professionals to help you get the exact style of photos and videos that you want. He sits with you and goes over the different ways to capture the day (documentary style, cinematic, etc) and then makes sure that professionals that excel in that style are there on your big day. Brandon himself is absolutely magnetic! If his personality alone does not capture you, i will be shocked! Our bridal party had amazing things to say about our videographer and two photographers and they kept the pace of the day as well as the energy! Having a company that gets you photo AND video will first save you money, but then also save you the stress of two different companies trying to jive together as well. Do not skimp, and don’t look anywhere else! JUST BOOK IT NOW. I do not have a sneak peak yet, photos below are my own.

Jeff was awesome! He was so detail oriented and did such a great job with our wild crowd. He included so many people in our video and it will be great to watch in the years to come.

Andrew and Auggie from Tower Studios were so much fun! We had a great time working with them on our wedding day! And Laurie was such a huge help! We talked to her many times before the wedding!

The Nakayoshi team was dedicated, prepared, experienced, and professional. They understood the stress and excitement of the day for our family and entered in appropriately. Not only did they capture our key moments and best angles, they conveyed our story authentically and helped us preserve it for generations to come!

Working with Kevin was a pleasure. He was incredibly easy to work with and turn around time was swift and as promised. We shot a video that captured our business process and also created a video web banner for our website. The professionalism and expertise from Kevin as a director and producer was honestly second to none. Have recommended his services to numerous already and will continue to do so. This holds a high level of production value and, to boot, Kevin is so kind and considerate.

This review is long overdue, but Katie and Al were absolutely wonderful to work with! I met with them twice before the wedding festivities, once with my mom and once with my fiance. Both times they were great about listening to our needs/wants and trying to capture what is most important to us. Katie was great about quick communication through email, and on the day of Al and his partner just blended into the background most of the time! We hardly knew they were there, except for the times that Al requested to work with us one on one. He never made us feel awkward, forced, or uncomfortable. We were free to be ourselves. When we got our highlight video in the mail a few months after the wedding, we were blown away with how incredible it was. Its the perfect length, the music choice was great, and they way that Al was able to capture the words that were spoken and blend it with scenes of our family, friends, and ourselves is marvelous. Al is truly talented. Our wedding video is our favorite thing to remember our wedding day by. My parents just watched it over and over again for days! My husband and I still just can't believe how perfectly it captures everything that is and was important to us on that day. We could not be happier with our video. You won't be disappointed by choosing to work with Vimage!

We were on the fence about having a videographer for our wedding but after speaking with Brian over the phone, I knew we would work with Jackson Videography. Brian and his assistant were great! The worked with us and our photographer to coordinate the best angles and they captured every important moment. From our vows to toasts at the reception, we love watching our video each year in our anniversary.
