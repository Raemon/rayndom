Our wedding

We recently celebrated our wedding at Callippe.   
Morgan and her team were very welcoming from our first tour at the golf course with horrible weather, to our food tasting, final decisions, rehearsal and of course our wedding day.  
  
The food was amazing. The atmosphere was beautiful especially ending the night with the party under the beautiful string lights. We couldn't ask for a more perfect wedding night

Beautiful Venue

We were married here 9/2024 and it was an amazing. Morgan was the event coordinator and she was so kind, helpful and supportive every step of the way. We had many compliments not only on how beautiful the venue is but how nice and helpful all the staff was! I would highly recommend to everyone!

Stunning venue!

We're wedding florists (Flowers Valley), and for us, working at Callippe Preserve Golf Course was a delightful experience. The team was professional and accommodating, making the entire process seamless. The venue provided a beautiful backdrop for our floral designs. Highly recommended!

Callippe is the best!

From start to finish, our experience with Callippe was amazing. Big shout out to Morgan and Taylor who went above and beyond to make our day special! The communication and coordination was great and they worked wonderfully with our day of coordinator. They were a pleasure to work with and we appreciated when they could accommodate our requests.  
  
  
It was difficult to imagine what the final day will look like, we had chosen a relatively simple theme with minimal decor. Our wedding day had the perfect weather, not too hot and not too cold (9/2/23). We absolutely loved how everything turned out, the ambience, decor, service, all of it. Our favorite part was during sunset with the hills in the background and all of our guests having fun.  
  
All the staff was very friendly and made guests feel very welcome. We will highlight that the food at Callippe is great. Our guests went back for seconds and I think that says a lot. They also made sure to make a plate for us, which we really appreciated since we were busy entertaining and having fun!  
  
Thank you Callippe for all your hard work, we highly recommend having your wedding here :)

#1 Best Wedding Venue in the Tri-Valley

I can't thank Morgan and Taylor enough for making our dream wedding come true! The day was nothing short of magical, and their staff played a significant role in making it a truly memorable experience for us and our guests.  
  
From the moment we first visited Callippe back in early Jan 2023, we were already impressed by its beauty and charm. We knew right away that we wanted to book Callippe as our wedding venue. The attention to detail, the stunning rolling hills view, and the impeccable service provided by your team absolutely exceeded our expectations. The CP staff's professionalism and willingness to accommodate our requests made the planning process so smooth and such a joy to work with!  
  
Our guests were equally impressed and have been raving about the venue's ambiance and the seamless flow of events throughout the day.  
  
Special thanks to Morgan for coordinating the day-of for our wedding and helping me hook my bustle, just in time for our first dance.  
  
Also, our greatest compliments to the chefs working tirelessly behind in the kitchen preparing and cooking such wonderful food! My MIL, who is typically a picky eater, exclaimed that this was the best wedding food she's ever eaten! The salmon, potatoes, and prime rib were nothing short of perfection and we continue to hear our guests sing praises about how great the food was that night! :)  
  
Thank you so much again Morgan, Taylor, and CP Staff for making our wedding truly special and memorable! Ben and I are eternally grateful for all of your help and our hearts are full of joy and thankfulness for the role your staff played in making our wedding day a dream come true!

Perfect venue

1) I gotta start by saying this place is incredibly all inclusive. Some venues start as just the venue but this place also offers catering and drinks, fire pits (as add on) and ceremony space. I did have a lot of elderly guests so it saved me a ton of effort and time schedule when both were in the same place and there wasn’t a ton of coordination for the guests to have to move between location and location.   
2) I was honestly so nervous about food since it’s the thing I knew my guests would be picky over. However, The food was the best! Honestly we got so many compliments on the food and how yummy it was! Also continuously ranked as the best wedding food we and my guests have ever tasted.   
3) super responsive! Their team was super helpful in responding to my day of coordinator and all of my copious emails. My coordinator even said that they were one of the best teams she ever worked with. The Callippe team is genuinely helpful and flexible.   
4) lots of freebies! The ceiling heaters! The uplighting! The wooden arch! All free and I love free! You would pay at least $1500 at another venue for uplighting and don’t forget to include the time it would take to coordinate. Time is money! This stuff was already included in the package.   
5) very affordable! This place doesn’t upcharge you just because it’s a wedding! My actual costs look expensive but since this place was affordable, I was able to upgrade the heck out of my package. We went for midnight snack, cocktail hour, open bar, most upgraded dinner option with the carving station (and they did not skimp on the cuts), and fire pits.   
  
Anyways if you reached the bottom of this review, what are you waiting for? Book Callippe and you won’t regret it!

Wonderful Venue!

My experience with this venue was perfect! I had no complaints! Big thank you to Morgan who was so nice and sweet and helped us the entire time from start to finish! Very professional! They were very prompt, organized, and the venue was so pretty. The view was beautiful and we have amazing photos. The food was great and everyone loved it! I highly recommend this venue as they will make sure your wedding or event goes smoothly!

Amazing Experience!

My husband and I booked Callippe for our wedding back in 2019 for our April 2020 wedding. Obviously, that date had to be pushed not once, but multiple times. The team at Callippe was amazing in their flexibility allowing us to move a date to when it was finally able to happen! Along the way, the team at Callippe was amazing at allowing us for small customizations we wanted for our wedding to make it more personal. We worked with Charissa and Morgan who were both fantastic. The venue was beautiful, everyone was so helpful and professional, and the food was great! We had so many people telling us after how much they had enjoyed the food. The day went better than we could have imagined, and a HUGE part of that was thanks to the wonderful staff at Callippe!

Callippe is AMAZING 

I had the pleasure of having my wedding at the beautiful Callippe Preserve Golf Course. My husband and I worked with Morgan Chandler, their head of events, over the past year and I cannot rave more about the experience. When it comes to planning weddings, Callippe is a well oiled machine and will make the entire experience completely stress free!!   
  
Callippe provides so much of what you need for a wedding-- the food, alcohol, tables, chairs, linens, arbor, floral, coordinator, BEAUTIFUL scenery, set up, etc. (All info is easily found on their website which makes it so easy! Including pricing)   
  
The food is not what you would expect from a golf course wedding. The food was INSANELY good. So many of my guests are still texting me saying it was the best wedding food they ever had!! We did the prime rib, chicken piccata, pesto pasta, garlic mash potatoes, green beans for dinner. DROOLING thinking back to it.   
  
The pricing of the whole Callippe experience is a STEAL. I couldn't believe what we got for what we paid for. I truly don't think there's a better venue out there.   
  
I could go on and on. I will always be incredibly thankful that I found this venue and will hold it close to my heart forever.   
  
Thank you to Morgan and Charissa for making our wedding day the best day of our lives!!!!

Best Reception Venue in the Tri-Valley Area

I am beyond thrilled with how perfect callippe was for our reception. Morgan was amazing to work with over the course of many months and my many questions and random requests. In the middle of ALL THE STRESSORS leading up to our ceremonies, Morgan's flexibility and empathy was a breath of fresh air. She was super organized and didn't judge me for being all over the place! Also...our bridal suite was setup with appetizers and beverages!! Now, onto Charissa....Charissa (F&B Manager) didn't say no to ANY of my random food and Bev requests. She found a way to accommodate everything I'd asked for. The day of the event, a few of my guests arrived late (after dinner)...Charissa went in and freshly prepared more of all the entrees for them!!!   
My guests were beyond impressed with the venue, views, hospitality, food (passed appetizers during cocktail hour and dinner), and beverages!!! All of the staff even beyond these two were amazing and super friendly!!!  
Here are some other random perks that I didn't even anticipate....all of the bride's and groom's drinks past our open bar were on the house!! Plus...they brought us (bride and groom) a heaping plate full of dinner while the guests were being led to the buffet area!
