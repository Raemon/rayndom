The people at Jewelry Barn are so nice and helpful. They gave us great advice on getting the right band to match my ring, including what it would be like to customize versus buy what they had on the floor. They worked with us so that we only had to pay a little each month up to the wedding and helped us figure out the best timing to get my engagement ring re-rhodiumed. I would absolutely recommend them to anyone!

I had an absolutely wonderful experience at Rivard Fine Jewelry in Lexington! From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed. Margaret, my salesperson, was phenomenal—she was warm, patient, and incredibly knowledgeable. She really listened to what I wanted and guided me through the options without ever making me feel rushed or pressured. Her expertise and genuine kindness made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. Thanks to Margaret, I found a piece that I truly love and will treasure for years to come. The quality and craftsmanship at Rivard are outstanding, and their customer service is second to none. If you’re looking for beautiful jewelry and an exceptional shopping experience, I highly recommend Rivard Fine Jewelry.

Had a very good experience with St John's and Myers purchasing an Engagement Ring and a Wedding Band! They are extremely helpful and nice people. They did a fantastic job of giving knowledge and opinions without making me feel pressured. At other Jewelry stores, I have been helped by workers who will only tell you what you want to hear and it does not end up helpful at all. St John and Myers are very knowledgeable about their products and everything they sell is high quality. My Fiancee and I are especially happy with her vintage Engagement ring. We really value that it is both Environmentally sustainable and One of a Kind!! (And of course I think it is very pretty too!!!)

I LOVE Phil and Tim! They were very helpful in helping me find the perfect engagement ring and wedding band for my future husband. Yes, I helped pick out my ring as I used to sell jewelry and my fiancé refused to buy me jewelry!!!! :) I ended up finding a vintage mine cut diamond and it was amazing. Phil and gang were amazing to work with! Would recommend to ANYONE! They have all prices and sizes!!!

We bought my engagment ring from them and then went back and got the matching band. They are great. They always offer to clean it when I come in. They also gave us a cash discount.
