We had our wedding last month at Carmon’s. The venue itself is GORGEOUS, the staff was amazing, accommodating, and professional. They have the most beautiful tables, chairs, and floral boxes that come with the venue (and amazing staff that set them up for you) We had such a great experience and we are so lucky we got to have our wedding at Carmon’s. We would recommend them for any event!!

After looking at several very pricey venues in the city, we stumbled upon The Nineteenth Century in Oak Park. And we were simply blown away! It is city-adjacent and had everything we were looking for. Woody took care of our every question and request. We rarely heard a "no" and we were able to craft the perfect wedding we had always dreamt of. He was very quick with his replies and offered us some invaluable advice when it came down to the nitty-gritty details you don’t always think about. The venue is directly across from a beautiful park, which made for pre-wedding photo ease! There’s also a very large parking garage next to the venue, so parking wasn’t an issue for anyone. Plus, with nearby access to the Green Line, our city guests were easily able to attend. We are still hearing compliments about the food served at our wedding. My husband and I are both foodies and were able to create a foodie-themed “prix fixe style” dinner menu, all while not breaking the bank. The day of our wedding, Ryan made sure everything went off without a hitch. He and his staff provided excellent service and we could not thank them enough! We even got compliments on their bartenders, as everyone definitely had a great time. As the ballroom has a very large stage, we happily contracted with a fantastic 10-piece orchestra who had our 165 guests dancing the night away. When the biggest gripe on your wedding day was that your florist (no connection to the venue) messes up the correct flower colors in some of your boutonnieres, you know you had a successful night! Huge thanks to Woody, Ryan, and their entire staff for making our wedding ceremony and reception so spectacular and memorable!

I remember searching, searching, and searching for an outdoor garden venue in Chicago for our wedding and when I found Community House online, I just knew it would be perfect. I had to see the venue without my fiancé but I called him immediately afterward and told him that I had a feeling it would be exactly what we wanted. Kelsey made planning easy and stress free. The gardens are gorgeous and provide the perfect backdrop for a late spring/early summer wedding. Even looking at photos now I feel like I completely lucked out on finding my dream venue. With the scenary, the price, and the staff, you truly can't find better.

Absolutely outstanding! Our day could not have been better. We were the second wedding to take place in the space back in October 2018, and had both our ceremony and reception onsite. From start to finish, working with The Dalcy team was one of the best parts of our wedding experience. The team was so kind and knowledgeable, and went above and beyond to help make our day perfect. Day of, everything ran so smoothly, and the food and service were amazing! The venue itself is also so beautiful and we loved that we didn’t have to do too much the florals and decor because the space offers so much.

Two of our daughters weddings in 16 weeks…our most recent event was at the BRIX on Nov 7th! Outstanding experience with the BRIX! Ample parking, no downtown traffic jams…Rob and Team cover every detail! Open vendor options, I had no issues with any vendors and highly recommend: 11th hour bartending, drapery by SNP and mortar design for China rental. Service was provided by Twin2Me me and catering by Francesca’s in Barrington. A wedding for 220, never felt crowded; we reserved the evening prior, which assisted with DIY decor and rehearsal. A huge plus! The entire team at the BRIX was amazing, professional, pleasant to work with. So many compliments on the venue! The ceremony space was converted from ceremony to appetizer hour in minutes. The Photo Booth was tons of fun, guests loved! The sound system amazing and after dinner lighting a lovely touch! A nice inclusion is an ice machine! Rob, my only suggestion would be the purchase of a food warmer in the chef prep kitchen space:) Sincerely, Mother of the Bride

having my venue at the Highland Park community house was everything I could’ve ever wanted from my wedding. From the very beginning, the communication was very clear and prompt. Any questions we had were answered quickly and clearly. The venue was stunning. Had plenty of space for us to decorate and make memories. They had so much available for us to utilize in our ceremony and our reception. This was the very first venue that we ended up looking at and we were sold immediately. The vaulted ceilings beautiful French doors very well maintained lawn and flowers were all so perfect. This venue is affordable and elegant and I highly recommend having your wedding or a special occasion here.

We could not have found a more perfect venue for our wedding on July 12, 2025. From the moment we showed up for our tour and met with Monique, we knew Kenilworth was the place for us. The venue is beautiful, historic, and well-maintained, yet the pricing and contract requirements are completely reasonable and fair. We felt comfortable and at home from that very first visit. We also found an excellent caterer (Catered by Design) from their preferred catering list. Monique was a dream to work with--so organized and punctual yet laid-back and flexible. We received so many compliments on the venue from our guests. While we opted to have both our ceremony and reception indoors, Monique allowed us to open up the lawn and patio to guests for cocktail hour, which was absolutely stunning and a huge hit. I would recommend Kenilworth to anyone looking for a wedding venue!

First of all, I can’t say enough good things about the staff at the Deerpath. Mary Ellen is a 5 star employee. She was so responsive to my every inquiry. She has so much experience and is so very capable. The moment I met her and signed up for a reception at The Deerpath, all my stress went away. Ok, most of my stress went away.😉 She takes pride in her work and it shows! I felt very comfortable relying on her opinion on certain menu choices when I had difficulty deciding. She was also very patient with me when I changed the table diagrams almost everyday weeks before the wedding. Alex and Felix were rock star employees too. The food was amazing and many guests complimented us on it. Remember to ask a staff member to dim the lights during dinner so the room glows with candlelight. Loved our September wedding reception at the Deerpath.

I don’t know where to begin, but the main thing is: The Haight made my wedding magical and truly like a real fairytale! There truly is nowhere else that will give the same experience or the same level of service from Kari Haight or her assembled team of fairy god mothers. I’m tearing up thinking about it. From the start, Kari decorated the entrance lobby with photos of us and our families, and it was just such a thoughtful and special touch. The outdoor aisle and rooftop deck is unreal, and if you’re getting married in fair weather it’s SO pretty with the lights. The reception area- WOW. The vintage lights and hanging greens were gorgeous. They set up everything so perfectly that I felt like I was on a movie set. The dance zone is also a great spot by the bar and they keep the rooftop open so you can take breather and fresh air after dancing. I’m telling you, this place has everything you’d want for your wedding day! Finally-Kari has a great team, she and her staff and vendors not only give top of the line service and coordination, but they were so kind and took attention to every detail. So I’d definitely suggest going with her preferred vendors, they know what they’re doing and then some. Also-I had a veil emergency and Kari raced to the rescue by providing me with one the day of! There’s just nowhere or no one else that’ll go above and beyond the same way.

I would highly recommend the Crystal Ballroom to any couple planning their wedding. My husband and I recently held our reception here and we were so happy with how everything turned out! Jessica was so helpful throughout every step of the planning process, and on the day of our wedding she coordinated with all of our vendors to make sure that everything ran smoothly. The entire Crystal Ballroom staff went above and beyond to make sure the room was set up beautifully, and the dinner, hors d’oeuvres, and drinks were all top notch! Our guests had so much fun and so did we!! Some other features that we liked about having our wedding at the Crystal Ballroom: -The cake is included in the price & is made by a bakery in Northbrook, The Baking Institute. (You can do a separate, private tasting beforehand to choose the flavor and they will decorate it any way that you would like). Our cake turned out beautifully and tasted so good too! -The Crystal Ballroom has a beautiful bridal suite on site, which was the perfect space for me and my bridesmaids to get ready on the morning of the wedding! -There is a very cute bar/lounge area located off the side of the ballroom, which really makes the event space feel more spacious. Guests can go there during the wedding to get drinks and relax off to the side, keeping the dance floor open!
