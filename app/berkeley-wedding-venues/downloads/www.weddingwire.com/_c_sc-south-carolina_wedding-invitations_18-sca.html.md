I had a wonderful experience with Duo Design Celebrations. I do not have an eye for design myself but had an idea for the style and color scheme I was looking for. They were able to take that and design absolutely beautiful invitations that included rehearsal dinner invites, and detail cards that incorporate the design, our flowers and venues!

A wonderful friend of mine recommended the Bellis Copy Center, she had her wedding invitation printed there as well. What I did is I ordered a design from a website that creates wedding invitations, then I edited each piece with my wedding information and saved them as a pdf. Of course if you are graphic design savvy you can make an invitation yourself for free. Then I brought my thumb drive to Bellis Copy Center. They printed a sample of each piece to make sure they were exactly how I wanted them. The staff was very nice and helpful, they even called me when my order was ready to be picked up. On top of being extremely affordable they gave me a Wedding Discount, which is awesome and my invitations came out beautiful! I highly recommend using them for your printing needs, whether it be save the dates, invitations programs, or anything else :)

Donna was very helpful and professional when helping design my Save the Dates and invitations. She was very quick in getting both the save the date cards and invitations back to me once the proofs were decided on, and she even hand delivered the products to me at work! She was extremely responsive, and even when I decided to change route on my invitation design, she had no problem understanding what I was looking for. We were concerned about the pricing of letterpress invitations, but Donna's rates were very reasonable, especially considering all the individual attention she gave me throughout the process. The quality of the cards and invitations was very good, and we received many compliments from guests and friends/family. Copper Dog Press provides very impressive services, and attention to detail. I would HIGHLY recommend their services to anyone looking for a printer to design any sort of event invitation or program in the future!

I cannot recommend Dodeline highly enough for your wedding stationery needs! From the moment we reached out, Sarah's professionalism and artistic vision shone through. She took the time to understand our style and preferences, resulting in invitations and signage that perfectly captured the essence of our special day. Thanks to Sarah, our wedding stationery became cherished keepsakes that we'll treasure for years to come.
