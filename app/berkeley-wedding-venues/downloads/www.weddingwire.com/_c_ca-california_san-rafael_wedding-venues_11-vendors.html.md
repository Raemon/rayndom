I photographed a wedding here in February of 2022. It is a gorgeous venue. The catering was delicious, the scenery was gorgeous and the hall was so perfect, with glass windows overlooking the golfcourse. It is a nice light venue, not dark and gloomy.

My husband and I got married here last weekend and the community center was a great venue for our 200-person wedding. There are many great options for all sorts of events, big and small. The Events Manager Pam Day was extremely helpful and accommodating throughout the whole process. Thanks for some wonderful memories!

This was the absolute perfect venue for me and my husband. Maple Lawn's "Magnolia Terrace" is where their outdoor weddings take place, and it's gorgeous. Summer in San Rafael has perfect sunny weather, the dark green redwoods and magnolia trees provide a shaded perimeter, and a bright red brick walkway leads up to the white arbor. We also loved the two white fountains, outdoor string lights, and the covered dancefloor. The historic Elk's Lodge on the property has a beautiful bridal suite and an old fashioned wood-paneled gentlemen's room downstairs. It's photo-op central on the rooftop, grand staircase, pool table, and more! I experienced nothing but professionalism and passion in working with Maple Lawn. Sue, the venue liaison, was so easy and FUN to work with, always prompt, and was always available in the planning process. Their bar liaison, Mark, was also an absolute treat to work with. When they didn't have a rosé brut sparkling wine on their bar list, he went and tasted rosés to find an option within budget so we didn't pay anything extra for the special request. It was incredible! Everyone I worked with just seemed to really like one another and be so happy and satisfied with what they do. Did I mention they have AMPLE parking? It was so nice not to have any concerns about my family and friends arriving comfortably. I can't say enough about how perfect this venue was for our special day.
