We got married at Nature Pointe over the weekend and it was everything we wanted and so much more! The team at Nature Pointe did such a great job meeting our needs and ensuring our day looked just how we planned. Major shout out to Marina, the coordinator at Nature Pointe, she did so great in supporting us and managing everything the day of (which was the day before her very own wedding)! She was a great communicator the entire process, she was calm, kind, helpful, and so easy to work with. Alongside her was Sara, who was also so great at answering all of my questions during the planning process. I truly cannot recommend Nature Pointe more for your own wedding. The venue is beautiful and so well kept, the staff is kind and understanding. It was really such an awesome day and I am so happy we decided to get married here!

We could not be happier to have booked Casas de Suenos to be our wedding ceremony and reception venue! LeeAnn, the owner, gave us a remarkable amount of attention throughout the planning process. Without her help, our wedding would have been far more stressful. Casas is gorgeous and we were also incredibly happy with our room, complete with hot tub. Our guests were amazed at how beautiful everything turned out and we had several people tell us after the fact that they interacted with LeeAnn and were impressed with how well she coordinated everything. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
