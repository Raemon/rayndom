Visited this venue

This is a beautiful venue we visited while we were in the area. The staff is so helpful. Morton has helped us. The hall was half booked for the date we were looking for and the other hall was not exactly what we were looking for therefore we didn’t pursue this venue but great customer service and beautiful hotel.

We chose the Hyatt Regency for our wedding venue. From the moment we walked in we knew we’d made the right choice. Actually, we knew even before that while communicating with Morton Pinto and his right hand assistant, Sylvia Par. Both were knowledgeable, helpful, friendly, and flexible, as well as professional. All of our guests commented it was THE BEST wedding ever. We know that part of it was the attention to detail given to us by the staff at the Hyatt. All the staff at the reception were awesome too. We have NO REGRETS and would recommend the venue to anyone.

We recently had our wedding reception here and we are so happy with how everything turned out! The staff was amazing. Our coordinator, Morton, and his team were very helpful, on top of things, and accommodating during our planning. They were very responsive to any questions or concerns, and made sure we were able to get what we envisioned our reception to look like. After our event, we got many compliments from our guests on how professional and how great the service was! We feel confident recommending this place for future events.

We had a great experience having our wedding reception at the Hyatt Poolside Pavilion! Our event planner, Allison was professional, easy to get in touch with and very accommodating of our requests. We definitely recommend this venue for other couples.

Food was cold, and some guests did not get the right menu. Appetizer was very limited, most of the guests did not even get to try it. Alcohol and beverage rates were a bit overpriced. Function room set up, service and maintenance is acceptable.
