5.0 out of 5 rating 

5.0 

I had the pleasure of working alongside D’Jalenta during her wedding and can confidently say she is an exceptional event professional. From start to finish, her communication was clear, organized, and thoughtful, making collaboration seamless. She was detail-oriented, calm under pressure, and ensured that every aspect of the event flowed smoothly. Her professionalism truly stood out. She was proactive, supportive of all vendors, and deeply committed to creating a great experience for the couple and guests. The quality of her work and her passion for events were evident throughout the entire day. Now that she has launched D’Jalenta’s Event Collective, I have no doubt she will continue delivering top-tier service. I highly recommend her to couples and fellow vendors looking for a reliable, creative, and dedicated event professional.

Where do I start? Less than two weeks ago my fiancé and I decided we wanted to get married in 11 days. Ambitious? Sure. Impossible? Not after we were directed to Alexis and Lisa. From the first conversation we felt heard, understood, even a little sane-ish. What felt daunting and unrealistic started to flow and come together. We rented a tent and decided to get married at home. We quickly went from less than 20 people to close to 50. Flash forward to our wedding day on 1.10.26. The dream team swooped me and took control of the tent/food/decorations/flowers/everything else and made it the most seamless experience for us. Stepping into the tent for the first time was like stepping into a different world. One that was elegant and beautiful. After the ceremony the team served salads, made sure dinner was ready and warm (refilled food also), kept the drinks stocked, cut the cake for us, and brought out the other desserts. While we partied, this amazing team was able to clean the dishes, put away as much food and decor away as they could, and did so completely inconspicuously to the guests! They went above and beyond in all regard and did not expect them to handle as much as they did, virtually every aspect of the wedding! By the end of the night it felt as though we were thanking and saying goodbye to friends we have known for way longer than under two weeks! To say thank you will never be sufficient. We are so thankful and beyond grateful for making our dreams come true and making our day so special. If you have any event in mind, please look no further than LBV for any and all of your planning needs. It was the absolute best decision we could have made and one we will be sure to make for all future occasions. Thank you Lisa and Alexis for everything.

JL original designs exceeded every expectation for our wedding day! From start to finish, Jen and Ashley were just amazing. Their professionalism, attention to detail,and dedication were unparalleled. To start the invitations were custom made and Ashley added a map to our gazebo ceremony location. The custom signs were impressive and even framed. The flowers were stunning, beautifully vibrant and perfectly arranged. They took their time to listen and communication was seamless. They went above and beyond when they were short with one table vase , they spray painted all of them to match my rose gold accents and our guests could not stop raving about the beautiful flowers. The flowers were all fresh except I wanted the arrangements outside by the gazebo to be silk so I could bring them home and they were simply stunning. They went above and beyond with arranging my place cards and everything was just perfect. Jen also placed the beautiful flowers on our wedding cake ! If you are looking for a reliable talented team who are passionate about what they do then this is your one stop shop for all your needs They made our wedding not just an event but an unforgettable celebration. I highly recommend them for top of the line service and a truly magical experience. Thank you ladies!!!

Working with Courtney Space Events was the absolute best decision we made! We used Courtney and her team at Courtney Space Events for my daughter’s wedding several weeks ago, and I highly recommend her. We used her for design (outstanding!!) and for day-of coordinator (which starts about three months before the day of). We had already booked the venue and most of the vendors, but I wished that we had booked Courtney from the start. She has so much knowledge of the industry and experience with the many vendors out there, that I will recommend to friends that they hire her before choosing the venue & vendors. Our venue came with their own event planner, but we quickly realized that we needed more help. After our first meeting with Courtney, the stress was gone! She and her team are delightful, helpful and really positive to deal with. They make the wedding planning fun, as it should be! Courtney took care of so many of the details leading up to the wedding day, which allowed us to focus on other things. And she did need to run interference with a couple of vendors for us, which I wouldn’t have done as well not knowing the standard practices. The team was with us throughout the wedding day, and took care of all the many details and any issues that came up (which did!!), always in a very calming and professional way. I was very impressed with all of them and so appreciative that they were there!! Thank you Courtney, Kristin and Maxine- you are all phenomenal!!

Hiring Erin for day-of coordination of my daughters wedding was the best decision I have ever made for her wedding. I contacted Erin only 2 months before her wedding and she so graciously fit this wedding into her schedule. Erin and her team handled all the details, details, set-up and tear-down with ease. I’ve heard so many times about couples thinking they can handle these tasks with their wedding parties only to realize there is no time. Erin and her team directed every moment and handled all of these details. My daughter and her husband just enjoyed their event without any worries. I would recommend Divine Celebrations to anyone!!! The pricing for the Day-Of was very reasonable and worth every penny. Lydia S. Wedding- 7.26.2025.

Hiring Something Blu as our day-of coordinators was one of the best decision we made for our wedding! From the moment they stepped in, they took the reins on all logistics, ensuring every vendor was aligned and operating on the same timeline. They worked logistical wonders - creating a minute-by-minute timeline that kept everything running smoothly and made sure every details was accounted for. They attended our rehearsal, helped guide the wedding party, and were instrumental in setting up and breaking down our decor. We truly could not have gotten through the day without them. Their communication was clear and the brought up so many questions I had not even thought of throughout the planning process. They were worth every penny and truly the biggest stress-reliever that allowed me, and our families, to just enjoy the day and savor every moment. If you're looking for a team that will handle the behind-the-scenes magic so you can focus on celebrating, look no further!

Susan was amazing to work with. My daughter was getting married not in our home town. I had the basics of the wedding planned and Susan helped make it perfect. She facilitated any meeting in the Harrisburg area that I could not get too. She was familiar with all the vendors that we chose to work with. By working with Susan and her staff, I was able to just be a very proud mother of the bride. The team took care of any hiccups. It was worth the cost.

Kelly was so easy to work with from the first day. From the start, she really helped shape the vision of what we wanted our wedding day to be. Kelly provided an excellent list of vendors based on our requirements, and was very diligent on providing us periodic updates and checklists on what tasks we needed to complete, which was instrumental in keeping us on track. She joined our calls with vendors and provided excellent suggestions and was a reassuring presence throughout the entire planning process. On the actual wedding day, Kelly made sure that everything was running smoothly and was there for us to guide us through all of the planned events. We were both so relaxed on our wedding day because we knew Kelly and her team were taking care of everything! She was also there when we needed her in case we had any issues or questions that came up during the reception. I would highly recommend Kelly and her team for all your wedding planning needs. We couldn't have picked a better person to work with!

We're so thankful we had Christina McLachlan as our wedding planner. From our very first meeting, we got along seamlessly. She got to know us as individuals and as a couple to help create the wedding day of our dreams. There is no way we could have done it without her. To organize all the vendors, rentals, venue, timelines, etc. is so overwhelming, but she made it look easy! Not only did we get a spectacular coordinator, but we gained a true friend. Christina is somebody you can trust and count on to get the job done. We hold her near and dear to our heart. Because of her, we had a BALLER wedding and made memories that will last a lifetime.
