My husband and I met in downtown Milwaukee, and I really wanted our wedding to be located there. We loved that the various rooms at the Harley-Davidson Museum had such a distinct atmosphere, and that there was plenty of indoor and outdoor space to accommodate our guests. Also, on-site free parking was a big win! After meeting with Alex, and seeing all that Harley-Davidson had to offer, we made our decision to book Rumble for the big day. Alex and Jen assisted us in planning all the menu details and rearranging the floor plan multiple times. Everything went smoothly the day of, and we are so grateful to have had a great team behind us. We do wish that the venue had been able to offer a more flexible bar menu, and hope that a POS system is on the horizon for future brides.

What a great venue for our wedding ceremony! The location was absolutely beautiful with views of the lake from the terrace. In addition to the wonderful location, Kristine and Brenda were amazing! Kristine was amazing with communication leading up to the wedding, including making changes for me as we neared the wedding date. During the rehearsal and ceremony Brenda was absolutely amazing, helping us and working with the photographer to get the terrace set. I would so highly recommend going with the museum for events! Definitely contact them as they have a variety of options for all event sizes!

We knew that when we wanted to get married, it would be at the Milwaukee Public Museum. It's a unique and fun venue that really reflected what my husband and I are about. I could not say enough good things about how our day turned out. We worked with Todd and Jen, who really went above and beyond with everything with setting everything up, even coordinating with our photographer to see the venue prior to the wedding. Our day of contact, Patty and staff were amazing. We had a small snafu prior to the ceremony, and they went as far as clearing the floor of guests to allow me to get to where I needed to be! The staff also went out of their way to make sure everyone had a great time and enjoyed the food. Everyone raved about the food, especially the mashed potato martini bar! Thank you to everyone who really made our day go off without a hitch!

We were incredibly happy with The Orpheum as our wedding venue! We had many friends and family from New York and it gave them the opportunity to stay downtown and walk to the venue (rather than renting a car) and also gave them an elegant and unique wedding experience. The balcony was the perfect place to have our ceremony, the lobby was a fantastic cocktail hour location, and the pit area was amazing to host our reception. Our guests couldn't stop talking about how cool it was that we got married in a historic theater for weeks after the wedding! Being able to have the venue completely to ourselves was extremely helpful: it allowed us multiple areas to change beforehand, made it easier for our vendors to access, and made it feel extra special too. Having our name on the theater marquee was also such a cool touch. Paige, our venue coordinator, was very helpful throughout the whole process. We had numerous zoom and in-person meetings to view the venue, discuss the day, make changes, and talk through situations. We had a lot of unique requests for the style of wedding that we wanted and were able to work through those to make it everything that we wanted! The flexibility to bring in all of our own caterers and food is what solidified our decision to go with The Orpheum. This allowed us to really cater to our guests, budget, and way in which we ran the event. Separately, having AV, lighting, and a sound engineer come with the venue helped us limit some of the things we needed our DJ to do and things that we needed to get to make all the things happen the way that they were supposed. Overall, we were tremendously happy with the venue, bar staff, and everyone else involved with our wedding. It was as perfect as we could have imagined. There isn't anything that can really match the uniqueness of the The Orpheum and we are so happy we decided to get married there. The pictures, videos, and memories will live with us forever.

We had planned to have an outdoor wedding in a park and use the park's pavilion in case it rained. But we weren't prepared for a once in a century flood to swamp the park under feet of water just weeks before our wedding. It was a desperate situation to be in during wedding season, so we couldn't have been more thankful to MMoCA for being over backwards to make space for us on such short notice. The building itself is gorgeous, and the glass stairs in particular sparkled and shone with the DJ's lighting while our guests danced the night away. It was the most beautiful venue I've ever been to, and I'm so happy we were able to celebrate there. It also ended up being much less expensive than other less-appealing venues. Our guests mentioned enjoyed the art, as well. Overall this was definitely the best experience I've ever had with a venue of any kind, and I would recommend it as my first choice for anyone looking to have a wedding in Madison.
