Danny and his team were amazing from start to finish. While some couples go to several wedding food tastings, Chuy’s was our one and done stop! Danny provided an tasting for me and my now husband and displayed the options available for our wedding day. During wedding planning, Danny was always available and answered questions very timely. I really appreciate that Danny was so organized and I trusted him 100% with our day. On our wedding day, the staff was so kind and accommodating to us and all of our guests. The staff took care of all serving and clean up needs. Danny even made plates for me and my husband and checked in on us and guests throughout the reception. The food was outstanding and we received compliments from several guests on our wedding food choice. I could not recommend Chuy’s enough for your special event or wedding. I am so glad we trusted Chuy’s with such a big part of our special day.

We retained Thompson Catering for our rehearsal dinner which numbered 100 and selected the Mediterranean menu option. The meal was fabulous.! The number of compliments we received were numerous. It’s a busy time for the parents of the bride and groom and that choice of service and cuisine left zero stress and complete enjoyment. The staff went over and above to make all feel welcome were very professional. We would definitely use again and highly recommend!

Seasons catering was absolutely wonderful to work with for our wedding! They had so many delicious food options - including for vegetarian guests! The staff were all lovely at the wedding reception and set up the catering table beautifully. We would highly recommend them!

Working with Holli for our daughter’s wedding was stress free! She walked us through all the details and executed everything perfectly on the big day. Finding an affordable caterer we knew we could rely on was very important since the wedding was more remotely located. Holli and Burnacos delivered in every way!

Our daughter was married on Saturday and WOW! Bayou Bluegrass knocked it out of the park. I can’t express strongly enough what professionals they are!! Our guests literally raved about how good the food was! The presentation and the quality of our buffet was just perfect. Dana Maloney was a dream to work with on putting together a menu and the table settings. If you are having an event in Lexington or surrounding areas, do yourself a favor and just call them! I will add photos once we get them back.

I knew this caterer from corporate events so it was a no brainer to consider them for my daughter's reception. They did not disappoint! The menus are plentiful and well rounded with salads, multiple entrees, and desserts included. The pricing was WAY MORE reasonable than most and the service day of was impeccable! I didn't have to lift a finger. They literally did everything and I didn't even realize when they were gone because it was so smooth and seamless. Highly recommend and also highly suggest the bacon wrapped brussels! But get more than 2 pans because they go fast!

If you’re considering a caterer for a small or large event, then ChefsPrep should be at the top of your list. They catered our wedding and amazed all of our guests! From the 16 hour smoked brisket, the crab encrusted salmon to the fan favorite, Asiago Mash potatoes, the food was out of this world. Marcus was responsive and helped us come up with a wonderful menu. He and his staff were great and felt like a part of our event which was heartwarming. Thanks, ChefsPrep. We will definitely work with you all again!

The set up was perfect and the food was outstanding. it was so nice to have the food taken care of, displayed beautifully and delicious. We highly recommend for events small or large. Getting ready to use them again!

I couldn’t recommend Dupree catering more. I myself am a wedding professional and manage a venue. I LOVE working with Dupree every time. They are always on time, always professional, also have the best food, and always clean up! The staff is friendly and kind and they always do a great job.
