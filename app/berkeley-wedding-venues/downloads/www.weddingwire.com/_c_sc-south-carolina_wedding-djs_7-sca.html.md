This DJ completely crushed it! From start to finish, the music was on point and the dance floor never emptied. Perfect mixes, great timing, and an awesome feel for the crowd. One of the best DJs I’ve experienced.

I heard about Sasha long before my wedding from some old highschool friends. I have always been in love with her work. When I went to plan our wedding she was my first choice. Her and Bryce went above and beyond for our wedding. They took so many amazing photos that our families and I will cherish for a lifetime. I gave them a rundown of what I wanted shot and they did all of that and more. I will always chose them & recommend them as long as I need photos done!

Our wedding was at The Porter Room at Holy City Brewery, and Nathan helped to make our wedding special. He brings his own uplighting for the room, and it really set the stage for a good time. Overall we highly recommend the guys at Elite Events for your wedding!

DJ Alan was incredible to work with! We decided on DJ Alan after doing extensive research and seeing him on our preferred vendors list. DJ Alan was responsive, has very fair pricing, and we had so much feedback from our guests saying the music was their favorite part! We had a meeting with Alan a few weeks before the wedding where we talked about songs that must be played, a list of do not plays, and then he also had us send some playlists of what we like so he can get an idea of our style so he could take some creative freedom as well! My husband wanted to walk down the aisle to the Formula 1 Theme Song and without fail, DJ Alan made it happen! The guests loved it. He also made sure to ask me before any requests before playing - one request was a Polka requested by my Polish grandfather and it was such a hit! For our dances, everything was timed appropriately. Flawless DJ Alan! We loved working with you. We also used two other musicians through Hilton Head Entertainment - Ami Rabinowitz for violin during the ceremony and Dean St. Hillaire for saxophone during cocktail hour - both phenomenal. 10/10 recommend working with any and all of them!

Michael from Wedding Music Charleston was the best. He was everything we could have for as a DJ and more. Not only was the music perfect, he was professional, considerate, organized, flexible and so pleasant to work with. He made working with a DJ no stress at all - he was so organized, and the music selection process was super seamless thanks to Michael's spreadsheet, which made it easy for me as a bride, when wedding planning can be so overwhelming. He knew what we needed, and provided it 110%. I could not recommend Michael more for your DJ needs - he really added something special to our wedding day.

Dj Roy Neptune did a fabulous job! Kept in touch weeks before the wedding and made sure we did everything we had in mind music wise. Everyone had a blast and enjoyed the music he played! I’ll recommend for ANY event!

Chris was on time and prompt. Everyone enjoyed the music he played and had a lot of fun. He kept the guest entertained the whole time. We didn’t have a coordinator and he was still able to que the music at the right time. He was a pleasure to work with and will be using him again if needed in the future. DH Chris is AWESOME
