We worked with Bernadette as the wedding coordinator. She was much more flexible than the previous wedding coordinator, who had to take a leave of absence during my planning. The church is beautiful and parking is abundant in the area. They are strict on what decorations you can put up (cannot remove what the church has, no tape allowed).  
  
Their Organist, Sarah, is AMAZING. Definitely look into having her play for you!  
  
Overall, it's a pricier venue, but it is a beautiful church that can seat 600 people. No regrets.

i didn't deal with jessie as she started in 2007. the previous coordinator was very rigid and on a tight schedule. she actually made us start on time which was good and bad. but the church was very beautiful and was everything i had hoped for in a church wedding.
