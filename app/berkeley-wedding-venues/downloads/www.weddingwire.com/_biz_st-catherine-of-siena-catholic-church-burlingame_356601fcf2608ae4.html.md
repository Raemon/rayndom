St. Catherine Church was the perfect place to have a solemn wedding, that's what we had last month for our wedding! Months before the wedding, we had fun attending the marriage preparation with Father John Ryan, he truly made us prepared with the life after ceremony. Sr. Anne Marie played beautiful music while Mrs. Nancy Sciutto, the coordinator, made sure everything's going to turn out well. I love St. Catherine Church!

We had our ceremony here. The church itself is beautiful- the outside facade as well as the interior. We opted to go without any floral arrangements at the altar because it was pretty enough by itself. It is dark inside, something for photographers to note. And beside the front steps there's not much of an outside backdrop for photos. The staff is wonderful and very helpful though. They responded quickly to all of our questions. A great location for our ceremony!
