## About this vendor

![Nicole Gelinas](https://cdn0.weddingwire.com/vendor/286212/original/960/jpg/uo_2212682_26047f1c-306f-4b20-8f3d-fa747f054e75.jpeg?r=1750763635)

#####  Nicole Gelinas 

Owner 

__Woman-owned

__8 years in business

__We speak English

__Just me

Shinglefish is the art baby and brainchild of Nicole Gelinas, an artist in Truro, Massachusetts, offering gorgeous handcrafted installations that help brighten up the wedding day. In the summer of 2018, the idea of Shiglefish was just that: an idea. Then, thanks to several sparks of inspiration, interest on Instagram, and an invitation to a local festival, the business exploded into physical form and has been growing and expanding ever since.

**Services Offered**

With a focus on joy, fun, and playfulness, Nicole and the team at Shinglefish create stunning original art pieces to illuminate the wedding day and add to its overall beauty. They design freehand-painted fish, sea creatures, surfboards, and much more using old, weathered wood that symbolizes the energy of water, wealth, and health. Nearlyweds can arrange a meeting with Nicole and the staff at Shinglefish to discuss specific pieces on upcycled cedar shingles and their array of wedding day gifts and thoughtful paper goods.
