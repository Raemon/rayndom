5.0 out of 5 rating 

5.0 

Builder and Blooms florals are truly something special. I experienced Holly’s work both as a bridesmaid and as a bride, and each time I was blown away by the care and intention behind every design. She included my favorite flower, cosmos, in both arrangements (an especially thoughtful touch given how delicate/difficult they are and how challenging they can be to transport) and they arrived in perfect condition. You can tell Holly treats every client like ohana. each piece feels personal, intentional, and created with genuine care. If you’re looking for florals that feel meaningful, elegant, and beautifully executed, I cannot recommend her enough.

Angie was amazing to work with for our wedding. She was professional, sweet, and patient with our ever-changing vision. She even created gorgeous arrangements for our arch at the last minute. I’m so grateful for her talent and flexibility.

I reached out to Elena with a certain vision that I had for my wedding and she exceeded my expectations. I sent her a few inspo pictures and what she came up with something more beautiful then I could've imagined. She is also incredibly affordable and will work with what you are looking for, which we needed since we were a smaller wedding. She will be my go to for any event we have in the future and I am so happy I had her for my wedding day. Thank you Purple Violet!!

We cannot say enough good things about Carley! From the beginning, Carley was incredibly responsive and truly listened to our vision. When we decided to change the color of the men's suits, she adjusted the floral arrangements to perfectly complement the new palette. The split floral arch was incredible and my bouquet was so beautiful. Carley, thank you so much— our florals were one of the highlights of our wedding day.

We were absolutely thrilled with our wedding flowers from Awesome Blossom Floral Design! 🌸 They turned out even more beautiful than we imagined, and we couldn’t have chosen a better florist. The team was so easy to work with, making the process smooth and enjoyable from start to finish. I especially love my bouquet—it’s stunning, and I can’t wait to preserve it as a keepsake to remember forever. Thank you for making our wedding day so special with your incredible work!

Tracey did an amazing job for our October wedding in South Lake Tahoe. She was easy to communicate with upfront, was flexible when we had some modifications along the way, and was extremely professional throughout the whole process. On the wedding day she arrived exactly when expected and the flowers and greenery we requested looked even better than I had imagined. She did a wonderful job and I would recommend her to anyone!

Brandie was an absolute dream to work with. She took our vision for bright florals with mixtures of pinks, blues, other bright colors, and absolutely blew us away! I had so many guests throughout the day come up to me and tell me how beautiful the florals were. They stole the show!

Bloomers did an incredible job bringing our vision to life and were so, so kind and helpful! The arrangements were beautiful and generously portioned. We re-arranged the altar arrangement to the head table, and they made sure it was a quick and easy transition and that the pieces worked well in both places. The personal flowers stayed vibrant all evening (and we appreciated the magnetic boutonnières), and the table garland and arrangements were perfect. V from their team even made a trip to our venue a few weeks ahead of time to make sure everything would work as planned. Delivery was timely and the team was great! I highly recommend working with this incredible team! Thank you so so much!
