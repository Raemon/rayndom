The music provided by Trillium was one of the best parts of our wedding. Cynthia was an absolute joy to work with. Trillium played beautifully at our wedding ceremony. My husband is an excellent cellist and he was highly impressed. The customer service and overall experience was fantastic. Thank you so much for making our wedding special.

We first heard Kiara and Adam play at the Greenbrier, where they were incredibly responsive to the MANY song requests made by my then 6 year old nephew who was undergoing chemo at the time. He even asked them to play the Zelda theme song, and Kiara was able to learn to play the song on the spot for him. He was thrilled! Later, when we were planning my wedding, my nephew excitedly asked if the "Greenbrier people" could play the Zelda theme song when he walked down the aisle as our Ring bearer. I laughed and told him that was a long shot... but I reached out to Kiara and Adam. They were incredibly responsive, accommodating, and easy to work with. They made the trek all the way to Richmond, VA for the wedding, and their music was as beautiful as we remembered. We were all so thrilled to have them play, and we can't thank them enough for their talents and service! They are the sweetest pair, and they brought so much joy to our wedding day.

Bob and Melissa are incredibly professional and completely worth the price to play at your wedding. It was a such a great experience working with them and the flute/cello combination adds an amazing ambience to your day!
