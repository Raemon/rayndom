Music That Made Our Ceremony Magical

Ghanay performed for our ceremony at the Maroon Bells Amphitheater, and to say she transformed the day is an understatement. She arrived early and started playing as guests trickled in, instantly easing nerves and setting a magical tone with the mountains in the background. Her renditions of our processional songs were beautiful and perfectly timed, and she even improvised a short interlude that created a seamless transition while our bridal party took their seats. Right after our kiss, she played our recessional song at the perfect moment. Since we didn’t have a traditional cocktail hour, she also played while we took portraits, which kept guests relaxed and made the time feel natural instead of like they were just waiting. I was standing for photos but still found myself dancing and singing along when she played “This Must Be the Place.” During planning she shared a thoughtful playlist (think Sam Cooke, Norah Jones, John Legend, Sara Bareilles) and made every song her own when she performed. Our guests could not stop complimenting her talent and how much her presence added to the ceremony. She was both fully prepared and totally in the moment, and brought such great energy to the entire experience. My husband and I feel so lucky to have found her. Ghanay is a beautiful soul with an incredible gift, and I recommend her to anyone who wants their wedding to feel even more magical.

A truly special artist and performer! 

We were incredibly lucky to find Ghanay about a month before our wedding, and she was nothing short of amazing. From the moment we connected, she was warm, responsive, and so genuinely kind. Not only is her guitar playing stunning, but her voice is absolutely beautiful.  
  
I had my heart set on walking down the aisle to an instrumental song that’s originally eight minutes long. Somehow, Ghanay learned it so quickly and played it so perfectly that I had goosebumps and tears in my eyes. She also learned another special song for our ceremony without hesitation, and both were played with so much heart and intention.  
  
Ghanay brought calming and joyful energy and made our day feel so magical. I cannot recommend her enough!  
If you’re lucky enough to book her, know you’re in the best hands. ❤️

amazing musician & such a kind human- definitely recommend!

Ghanay was absolutely amazing to work with! Communication was 10/10 and working with her was very easy. She sent such sweet & encouraging texts leading up to the event and was very understanding and helpful with planning out the logistics of the music for our venue. Her guitar playing and singing were absolutely beautiful and perfect for our intimate morning/early afternoon wedding. She was so incredibly kind and both ourselves and our guests were so impressed by talent and professionalism. I cannot recommend Ghanay enough for any of your event needs!

A dream come true! ✨

I walked into my first experience with Ghanay thinking I was getting some nice crystal bowl action for our retreat group, and left feeling like I never want to attend another persons sound bath. We also had the pleasure of having her guide a breath work class, and the sentiment was the same. There are not enough words to express my love for Ghanay and her talents. Her gong (in the sound bath) is so powerful, and her voice… the cherry on top of both experiences. “It’s not just a sound bath, it’s more like a sound journey.” It’s a perfect description for what Ghanay takes you on as a guide in both sound and breath, and I recommend her with the highest regard.
