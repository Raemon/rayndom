Giulia went truly above and beyond as our wedding music coordinator. She accommodated last-minute changes to our processional, rewrote all of our selected pieces for a simplified string duo, and ensured every musical choice fit seamlessly into our ceremony. She even found us a cantor who sang the most beautiful Ave Maria. Planning a wedding in Rome from the U.S. meant placing a lot of trust in her, and she exceeded every expectation. Giulia was exceptional from start to finish, and I HIGHLY recommend her services to anyone.

We truly cannot speak highly enough about Antonio and La Semicroma Music. We hired the company for our two-day wedding celebration, including a folk band, a jazz trio (including Antonio singing), a violin and cello for the ceremony, and a DJ (DJ Condor). Every performer was brilliant, taking what was already such a special weekend to the next level. The jazz trio in particular was a highlight for all of our guests, who thought they were all incredible performers. Throughout the process, Antonio was very communicative and easygoing, and made the process extremely smooth. Was an absolute dream to work with Antonio - we would recommend him and the company to literally anyone getting married in Italy.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Unforgettable Music Experience – The Heartbeat of Our Wedding in Italy! We had the absolute pleasure of having both a saxophonist and DJ perform at our wedding in Italy, and they completely blew us and our guests away! From the moment the music started, the energy, professionalism, and pure talent they brought to the day elevated the entire experience. The sax player added such a magical touch — it felt like we were living inside a movie. His smooth live solos during cocktail hour and later over the DJ’s beats were absolutely unforgettable. Guests are still talking about how cool and unique it felt. The DJ was phenomenal from start to finish reading the crowd perfectly, mixing seamlessly between songs, and keeping the dance floor packed all night long. Every transition, every beat drop, every moment felt carefully curated for us. They created the perfect vibe elegant, joyful, and so much fun. Thank you both for helping make our wedding feel like a dream! We couldn’t recommend you more highly any couple would be lucky to have you at their celebration.

Laura was absolutely amazing! She sang beautifully during the aperitivo and DJed at the party, keeping the energy perfect throughout. She was with us from the very beginning, and even when we had to change our wedding date, she was incredibly understanding. On the wedding day, she was punctual, flexible, professional, and a joy to have around. She always replied promptly to our messages and requests, getting us excited for the big day while also making us feel calm that everything would be okay, and it was. Everything went perfectly, and Laura was truly key to the success of our wedding. Not only is she exceptionally talented, but she is also a lovely person. We could not have asked for anyone better; she was simply perfect. We highly recommend her!

Federico was an absolute joy to have at our wedding. From the moment he arrived, his kindness, energy, and genuine love for what he does set the tone for an unforgettable celebration. While the language barrier made communication a little challenging at times, he was so kind, patient, and committed to understanding what we wanted that he made every bit of effort completely worth it. His warm personality shone through in every interaction, and we could tell how much he cared about creating an amazing experience for us. He didn’t just play music — he created an atmosphere. During the cocktail hour, he played the saxophone to set a more intimate, classy tone that our guests absolutely loved. Later in the night, when he brought out his saxophone lit-up, it was a complete showstopper and the whole vibe elevated instantly. His ability to shift from elegant and understated to high-energy and electric made the entire event feel dynamic and unforgettable. We received so many compliments about him from our guests. Federico truly created an amazing experience, and we couldn’t be more grateful. We highly recommend him to any couple looking for someone who will bring heart, magic, and pure joy to their celebration.

Stepped in at last minute after a very dodgy supplier messed us around and let us down a week before (who then claimed to 'save the wedding' by finding this supplier to step in! 😂). However I'm grateful that it ended up with us having our lighting and sound equipment supplied by Smart sound as they were absolutely fantastic. Very professional, flexible and willing to go the extra mile to make your day perfect! So so grateful and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for lighting or sound equipment. Another bonus was the arrangements were discussed in fluent English, which was difficult with other suppliers who only spoke broken/very little English. Thank you to you all at Smart Sound!!

The Salt Peanuts Show are excellent musicians, they are entertainment, spectacle and friendliness. They made us dance and accompanied us all day with their music. Highly recommended, even by our guests!
