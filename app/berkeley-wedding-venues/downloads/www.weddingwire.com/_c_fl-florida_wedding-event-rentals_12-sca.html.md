I can’t say enough good things about my experience with this vendor. Haley & Louis went above and beyond from start to finish. The communication from the time I booked, to the time they set up the flower wall was exceptional. They made sure I was satisfied and were very professional. I was surprised by the quality of the flower wall, I feel like it was the perfect addition to my event and we had so many compliments from our guests. Haley & Louis were quick with set up and tear down, and were very personable. I will recommend them to anyone looking for a flower wall in the future.

My son’s wedding in St. Augustine was unforgettable, and the rentals from AAE played a huge part in that. The tent, linens, and chairs looked stunning together.

Caloosa Tent did an excellent job on my wedding earlier this year. The girl that I worked with in the office was really helpful and the crew that set up was great. I was really nervous about everything but they took great care of it all! I highly recommend.

Dealing with them was easy. Very thorough, polite, and courteous. Made changes along the way and they are flexible providing they can find what you are looking for. Set up team was fantastic. Worked hard, diligent, and polite. Came the next day and took down everything and the place was left spotless. Would definitely use them again. This was an outdoor wedding for 67 guests with a band. We used the air conditioning system which was excellent.

As a wedding planner, I’ve trusted The Chair Affair for over four years to provide beautiful chairs and settees that always elevate my events. Their rentals are stylish, high-quality, and impeccably maintained, all at a fair price. The team is reliable, professional, and a joy to work with — always going above and beyond with excellent customer service. They’ve become my go-to rental company, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to create a stunning, stress-free event.

Highly recommend Event Outfitters for your rental needs! We used them for our wedding and had a great experience. Very reasonable pricing, extremely responsive, a beautiful variety of rental options. They helped us transform a park into an elegant feeling venue at a fair price point. We are so happy!

We absolutely loved all the items we rented from Ranco for our Hilton Head Island wedding! Their x-back wooden chairs added such a great beachy touch to our ocean-front wedding, along with the driftwood chargers. They were very flexible and even added some items last minute for us like the napkins, chair cushions, and space heaters. They were very responsive and timely, and everything was set up beautifully! I'd 100% recommend them for any wedding and they have a wide variety of rental items to choose from!

From the outset, Ileana invested time in understanding the vision I had for the room and decoration. My husband and I were thrilled with how the drapes transformed the space. Ileana went abive and beyond liaising with the wedding planning team, communication was prompt and she delivered a 5.star service. Couldn't recommend highly enough . Thank you x

We hired Coast to Coast for mahogany garden chairs for our wedding reception. They were hundreds of dollars less than what other rental companies were asking, included delivery, set up and breakdown, and were on time for delivery and pick up. We highly recommend them for anyone looking for event rentals.
