Ruth was fabulous she spent hours helping us pick out invitations. I came in with a very specific idea of what I wanted and that changed as time went on. She was patient and very helpful not to mention I got 40% off my invitations. Definitely worth the drive, from Snohomish to Puyallup. I loved my invitations, and had a great deal of compliments on them from others.

Bliss Ink is an Online site where you can purchase GORGEOUS top of the line invitations and more. They custom design anything they offer and more if you just ask! They let you choose fonts, colors, stlyes and even offer suggesstions to help make it easier. They are in Washington State and I live in Michigan and still used them even though I was nervous because they sent me samples of anything I wanted to see and emailed me full samples prior to me placing my order. They are true professionals! My invitations were great, my friends and family still talk about them today!

Kristen didn't do our invitations, but I wish she had! My invitation company, Savvy Designs, went under right after we got our order, so we turned to Kristen from Cry Baby Ink for our programs, escort cards, table cards, favor tags and other paper elements for our wedding. Kristen is very responsive and fast on e-mail and sent me photo proofs of her ideas. We went back and forth on a few of the ideas before we came out with the "logo" image that we used on all our paper details. I was really happy with how everything came out. The table cards and programs, they all gave our wedding the finished, stylish look that we needed to tie it all together! I enjoyed working with Kristen and have recommended her to a number of my friends for their weddings and everyone has been extremely happy with her work! If I had it to do over, I would have hired Kristen from the start for our invitations and basically everything paper-related. She's a paper diva!
