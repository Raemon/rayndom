We had the honor of celebrating our wedding at Rimrock Ranch on November 1st, and I cannot emphasize enough what an incredible experience we had. From our first meeting, Gwen made sure we were taken care of — from a detailed list of recommended vendors (all of whom were amazing), to check-in calls as we got closer to our date, being available as my stress started to spike, her rockstar team who welcomed us and made sure we had everything we needed — and most of all, the most magical backdrop for our special day. Rimrock was perfect. We had about 120 guests, which felt like the perfect size for us. There was enough parking for all (we did encourage carpooling and pre-booking taxis just to be sure). We had several of our friends stay on the ranch with us, which made the weekend even more special. We held a welcome dinner Friday night, with about 40-50 people — Ranch staff made sure we had plenty of adult beverages while we enjoyed everyone’s company. The Hatch House was lovely, and the perfect spot for me and my ladies to get our hair and makeup done before the ceremony. And the ceremony location — pure magic. The venue naturally created so many beautiful photo opportunities for our guests, with that gorgeous sunset leaving everyone in awe. Gwen even offered to let us take some wedding photos with one of her horses! Not too hot or cold, but they had plenty of blankets for anyone who needed one. By the time it was over, my gratitude was endless — Gwen, Eric and their team took such good care of us, and I felt so happy with every single moment. Five stars, highly recommend!!! Love you, Rimrock!!

Crafted at The Port of LA is an amazing venue. We held our corporate event of over 200 people in their large space. The venue is a huge blank slate that can be customized to fulfill your wildest imagination. The staff is amazing and helped us create a memorable event. Everything was perfect.

BOOK THEM NOW! We can't express how thankful we are to University Club of Pasadena for hosting our dream wedding. My husband and I toured countless venues and the services University Club provides exceeded them all. 1\. You get the venue for the entire day! Other venues we toured had strict times we could enter, some even requiring the bride to arrive completely ready because there wasn't a space for HMU. Cinthia was so flexible and even allowed us to arrive at 6AM to begin getting ready! We had a brunch spread with our family/bridal party there, where Cinthia had the staff assist with setting up and tearing down our brunch tables. 2\. The bar package is VERY flexible compared to other venues. We noticed that most of the venues we considered have a per-head cost, expensive since some of our elderly don't drink. UC instead allowed us to set a general bar limit, which afterwards they would convert into a cash bar (we didn't end up reaching our limit, but this was a very cost-effective set-up for us). 3\. Joy and Tony were incredible at customizing our drinks! Joy had so many creative suggestions for Asian inspired drinks - they allowed us to have multiple taste testings and we landed on a lychee mojito and strawberry soju in a martini glass. We had SO many guests rave about our signature drinks, asking us for the recipes! 4\. They went above and beyond for desserts!!!! We were so disappointed when other venues either don't allow outside vendors or have a fee - we're not cake people so we wanted to bring in Fosselman's ice cream instead. Cinthia and Chef Tony not only allowed us to bring in outside ice cream, but even told us that UC regularly serves Fosselman's for the club members so they could provide the ice cream for us instead of us bringing it! We originally wanted an ice cream bar, but they informed us they could only scoop the ice cream from the kitchen and have the waiters pass them around on trays because of their freezer location. However, the week of our wedding, Cinthia called us and said they've figured out a way to create our ice cream bar! It meant so much to us that UC was still trying to figure out a way to have our dream dessert station even though my husband and I were fine with tray-passed ice cream - and SO many guests complimented us for the ice cream station! 5\. Cinthia and Chef Tony are very willing to work with you to make sure the entrees are exactly the way you want it! We initially weren't incredibly happy with the salmon during out taste testing, so they had us come in again to try the chicken with another free taste test (this is a huge deal - other venues often charge for taste tests)! They even allowed us to sub mashed potatoes for scalloped potatoes etc. I'll be honest - we thought the food at our taste testing was okay, pretty decent wedding food. BUT the food the night of our wedding was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! We had so many guests (some of our guests are even wedding coordinators) compliment us for the food! Multiple parents also said this wedding had the best kid meals they've ever seen with delicious chicken tenders and fries - I had a dad even ask if he could also have a kids meal! Other details that makes UC stand out... \- Parking ON SITE with a private lot! \- You have the entire building to yourself! \- Indoors in case of rain! \- I noticed some wedding websites giving UC three dollar signs, but this venue is actually VERY accommodating to your budget with fair prices \- 10/10 STAFF. Cinthia, Tony (bar), Tony (chef), and Joy are absolutely amazing to work with!

Yellowrose Inn exceeded every expectation. Bess hosted a corporate event for me, and the entire experience was seamless from start to finish. The space was absolutely stunning—beautifully designed, impeccably maintained, and perfectly suited for a professional event. Bess is a true professional who anticipates every detail and executes with care, creativity, and precision. Her attention to detail, organization, and hospitality made the event effortless and memorable. I couldn’t have asked for a better venue or host and would highly recommend Yellowrose Inn for any corporate or special event.

As a Wedding Videographer referrals are my preferred way to connect with future clients. Whether by photographer, planner or venue - It is the highest compliment! Whenever I see a referral from The Mountain Terrace I am delighted. It is a stunning venue and is the perfect mix of a variety of locations and a compact, accessible and comfortable venue. It is so well designed and offers beautiful views as well as cozy places for guests to enjoy. The locations for filming are gorgeous as well, between the redwood trees, sweeping views, expansive lawn and twinkle lights hanging from the white tent - the backdrops are perfect to capture the many sides of a Wedding Day. I am always impressed by the food and the professionalism of the staff. They care so much for their clients and guests experiences and have high standards that they hold for all the vendors as well as their staff. I always feel a part of a team which helps me serve my clients all the better! I am grateful to have built the relationship that I have with Caren, Anastasia, and Kristy and look forward to seeing more referrals in my inbox and having the opportunity to film at The Mountain Terrace many more times!

Harbor view loft was an amazing wedding venue. We had our wedding there in November and their staff were so helpful, attentive, and always answered all of our questions. Our wedding coordinator was amazing! They made our vision come to life and really cared about all the small details! Harbor view loft had so many options to make our wedding so easy and stress free, as we did not live in SD, it was a breeze to communicate and plan stress free experience! They also had wonderful vendors to use that know the venue! We can’t thank all of them enough!

As a wedding photographer, I’ve had the joy of working at Magari Estate several times, and it’s truly one of my favorite venues in Northern California. Every single time I photograph here, I’m reminded why it stands out above the rest. The property is a dream to shoot, with rolling golden hills, gorgeous landscapes, and that signature California light filtering through the oak trees. Every corner of the estate feels intentionally designed for the guest experience. From the beautiful ceremony area nestled beneath the oaks to the open-air reception space, charming barn, and the unique circular bar that always becomes a guest favorite, there are endless backdrops that make each wedding feel unique. Beyond the scenery, what truly sets Magari Estate apart is the venue team. They are some of the kindest, most organized, and genuinely supportive people I’ve had the pleasure of working with. They go above and beyond to ensure their couples and vendors feel cared for from start to finish. Communication is always smooth, timelines are thoughtfully managed, and there’s such a calm, welcoming energy that flows through every event. If you’re a couple searching for a breathtaking Northern California venue or a vendor hoping to work alongside wonderful people in a truly photogenic location, Magari Estate is an absolute gem. Five stars all the way.

My husband and I got married at Green Gables a little over a month ago, and we're still basking in the joy and magic of our special day! We can't recommend Marisa and the Green Gables team enough - they truly made our wedding dreams come true. From the moment we started planning, Marisa was with us every step of the way, offering expert guidance, creative ideas, and unwavering support. Her attention to detail, passion for her work, and ability to anticipate and handle any issues that arose were truly impressive. Green Gables proved to be the perfect venue for our celebration - the lush surroundings, charming decor, and warm ambiance created a welcoming atmosphere that our guests absolutely loved. And the food? Exceptional! Our guests are still raving about the delicious cuisine. What struck us most was Marisa's ability to bring our unique vision to life, while also ensuring that every moment was relaxed, enjoyable, and stress-free. Her calm and reassuring presence kept us focused on what mattered most - celebrating our love and commitment to each other. If you're looking for a wedding coordinator who will exceed your expectations and a venue that will leave you and your guests in awe, look no further than Marisa and Green Gables. We're so grateful to have had them by our side on our special day!

## California Wedding Venues, Wedding Venues in California

Glamorous, beautiful, and filled with some of the most exciting cities in the entire world, California is a realm unto itself. It’s nearly impossible to capture all that California has to offer, from the chill beach town of [San Diego](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/ca-california/san-diego-la-jolla-coronado-carlsbad/wedding-venues/825-11-rca.html "San Diego Wedding Venues") to the glitz and ritz of [Los Angeles](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/ca-california/los-angeles-county/wedding-venues/803A-11-rca.html "Los Angeles Wedding Venues"). Hurtle down snow-covered slopes in Big Bear or become an overnight millionaire in [San Jose](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/ca-california/san-jose/wedding-venues/11-vendors.html "Wedding Venues in San Jose"). Sip delicious vino in [Napa Valley](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/ca-california/napa-valley/wedding-venues/807N-11-rca.html "Napa Valley Wedding Venues") or admire how the fog rolls off the Golden Gate Bridge in [San Francisco](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/ca-california/san-francisco-san-jose-oakland/wedding-venues/807-11-rca.html "San Francisco Wedding Venues").

Simply put, California can be anything you want it to be. It is a land of looming mountains, sprawling deserts, magnificent redwoods, sun-soaked beaches, and pristine national parks. If you plan on tying the knot in the Golden State, you have a nearly endless list of venue choices. California is a state where dreams become reality, so it’s the perfect place to host your dream wedding.

## Finding the Right Wedding Venue in California

California is a massive state-comprising over 163,696 square miles. With such a large surface area to cover, when you start your search for that perfect California wedding venue, your best first step might be to narrow down your geographic area. California is usually divided into Southern California, Central California, and Northern California.

Next, start thinking about what kind of wedding environment you want. California is one of the few states that can offer you small mountain venues, breezy beach venues, romantic countryside venues, and stylish downtown venues, all within a relatively short drive of each other.

Finally, with your newly narrowed list, let’s talk venues. No surprise, California offers almost anything you could imagine. Do you dream of an elegant [hotel wedding](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/ca-california/hotel-weddings/601-sca.html "California Hotel Weddings")? You have thousands to choose from throughout the state, from cozy inns in adorable towns like Julian, to posh, five-star options that cater to the stars in Los Angeles and San Francisco. California’s gorgeous year-round weather makes it a great location for [park weddings](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/ca-california/park-weddings/103-sca.html "California Park Weddings"), [boat weddings](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/ca-california/boat-weddings/47-sca.html "California Boat Weddings"), and [rooftop weddings](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/ca-california/rooftop-loft-weddings/102-sca.html "California Rooftop Weddings"). Just make sure you check your [budget](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/wedding-budget.html "Wedding Budget Planner") before you set your heart on a specific venue. Everything in California is larger than life, including venue price tags.

## How to Choose the Right Wedding Venue in California

Once you have your sights set on a few top California wedding venues, it’s time to schedule a venue tour. This is your chance to meet the venue coordinator and to ask all your pressing questions. First, cover the basics. Make sure the venue is available on your preferred wedding date and check on its capacity. Next, ask about wedding packages. If you already have vendors, like a [photographer](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/ca-california/wedding-photographers/10-sca.html "California Wedding Photographers") or [caterer](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/ca-california/wedding-caterers/3-sca.html "California Wedding Caterers") in mind, see if the venue will allow them. (Some venues require you to use their staff or to choose from an approved vendor list). Finally, check to make sure the bathrooms are clean and easy to find. Seriously. Your guests will thank you.

At WeddingWire, we are here to help you get hitched without a hitch. As you begin planning your California wedding, take a look a look at your [wedding checklist tool](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-checklists.html "Wedding Checklists") and start building your [wedding website](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-websites.html "Wedding Websites").
