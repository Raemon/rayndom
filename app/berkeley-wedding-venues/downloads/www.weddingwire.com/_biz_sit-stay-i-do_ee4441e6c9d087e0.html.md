Highly recommend for your dog handling needs!

Brooke and Rio were a pleasure to work with. Leading up to our wedding they were organized and responsive. They thought about every detail and even brought a decorative leash for photos, something we had completely overlooked. Our dog had a blast that evening and we received lots of photos of her play time and naps. Overall it was a very professional and seamless experience.

Loved loved Sit. Stay. I Do.

We’re so lucky to have found Brooke and Rio! They handled our dogs with so much love and attention, and it meant the world to us. They even helped coordinate pup photos and made sure they were comfortable throughout the chaos of the day. Truly pros. If you're thinking about including your dogs in your wedding - do it, and call Brooke and Rio!
