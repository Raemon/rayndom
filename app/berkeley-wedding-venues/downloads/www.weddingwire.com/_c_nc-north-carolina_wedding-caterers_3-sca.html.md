Black Eyed Susan took care of everything we needed for our catering and bartending on the day of our wedding. All the food was cooked on site so everything was super fresh. They had amazing appetizers for our cocktail hour. The mashed potatoes with leek butter at dinner was the biggest hit!!!!

I highly recommend booking Middle of the Island! So easy to work with, which made the planning process stress free. During our wedding tasting we were able to try a TON of food. He even made custom items for our wedding menu, which made it unique to us and our guest.

One word, DELICIOUS! They have so many yummy options on their menu it was hard to narrow it down. Luckily, we got to go in for a tasting and got to try our options for our wedding and then some. The tasting helped us solidify what we wanted to order. Usually, I am not overly impressed with buffet style food at weddings. This was entirely different! We got comments all night about how good the food was and even today (several days later), are still getting people telling us how great the food was. Would definitely recommend ART for all your catering needs.

We had a daytime wedding and love brunch, so our food theme was brunch buffet! A Thyme Savor was so accommodating for this, having the perfect options for us to choose from and try and ultimately curated the most delicious menu! The Monte cristo’s were hands down a favorite item. Liz was wonderful to work with, providing all the information we needed and consistently checking in to make sure we were good to go. And the staff for day of service was great! Very kind and accommodating to everyone! I know they have a variety of other menu options and we just decided to go with brunch, but this makes them even more of a fantastic option given the flexibility in choices they have. Highly recommend!

From the moment we met Chef Wes at the OBX Wedding Expo, we knew Red Sky was something special. His energy and passion were undeniable, and once we tasted the food, our search for the perfect caterer was over. Everything was fresh, flavorful, and thoughtfully prepared. Chef Wes went above and beyond throughout the process, even surprising us by personally showing up to our tasting. His guidance in curating the menu was both professional and personal, making the entire experience seamless and genuinely fun, especially while planning from across the country. On our wedding day, the Red Sky team exceeded every expectation. Their hospitality and service were flawless, and our guests couldn’t stop talking about the food. During sunset photos, they surprised us with a charcuterie of our hors d’oeuvres (such an unforgettable touch!), and the beignets were an absolute hit. Red Sky didn’t just provide a meal, they created an experience we’ll never forget.

Kelly’s catering was absolutely perfect! A company that could deliver and had the type of food I was looking for, for the wedding. And they were flexible when I had to change the venue last minute. My guests and I loved the food! I will definitely cater with you guys again in the near future. 100% recommend

We were so happy with our choice to book Lone Cedar for our wedding! Immanuel was so kind and very communicative when building the menu and having the tasting. We landed on Parmesan Crusted Chicken with potatoes, and Shrimp Scampi, both delicious! We also added on Dishware and Bartenders through them. Thank you!
