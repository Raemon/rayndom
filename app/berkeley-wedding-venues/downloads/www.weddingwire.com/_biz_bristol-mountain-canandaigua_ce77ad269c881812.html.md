Amazing amazing amazing 

We cannot say enough about the exceptional experience we had at Bristol mountain. April, our coordinator, was fantastic, helpful and extremely knowledgeable throughout the process. There wasn’t a single question I threw her way that she didn’t have an answer to. Our entire day went seamlessly because of her hard work and the wonderful staff members. The food surpassed our expectations by far, our guests are still talking about it. The catering staff and bartenders were, friendly, and paid attention to the small details. We moved our ceremony indoors due to weather and had multiple options to accommodate what we were looking for. We had our rehearsal dinner in the Cannery which we highly recommend as well. We had a beautiful day and are so grateful for the wonderful experience we had.

Best day ever!

April was absolutely amazing to work with. She managed our chaotic wedding party with ease and patience. The venue was absolutely gorgeous. We did our first look on the summit and the view was beautiful. The rocket lodge was more than enough room for everyone, our guests really enjoyed sitting out by the firepits and mingling. The food was delicious and the open bar was well worth it.

Great venue. Our guests really enjoyed the food and the ski lift. The staff there were very accommodating to the changes we wanted to make for the room layout, as well as the changes in menu. This is a great venue for couples who want more of a "DIY" wedding, as it was a lot of work to transform the room. It was exactly what we wanted our wedding day to be, not a "cookie-cutter" venue that had everything already in place. The staff was very helpful when we found ourselves struggling to make certain ideas work and when we ran out of supplies. They all seemed like they truly enjoyed contributing to our special day.

I want to start by saying that Chris Carver in banquets was FANTASTIC. He and his banquet staff were great. That is why the ratings are as high as they are, especially for quality of service.  
  
I won't go into too many details, but if you are planning to use Bristol as a reception site, keep all of your correspondence with the event sales staff. At the last minute (literally, a week before the wedding), they were trying to go back on promises that were made a year earlier. They ended up doing what they said they would, but it made for a stressful time.  
  
They talk about fireworks in their brochure, but they don't tell you how it's pretty much impossible to make it happen -- actually I should say that they don't tell you until AFTER you pay the $1000 non-refundable deposit how it's pretty much impossible to make it happen. Between permission from the town, permits, and all of the other red tape they put up, we paid for something that never happened.  
  
The Sky Ride was amazing, and we are so happy that we finally were able to work out the details to make it happen. It made for amazing pictures, and our guests loved being able to travel up the mountain.  
  
I would recommend Bristol Mountain Ski Resort in terms of the setting and scenery and awesome extras, but I would do so with some reservation.
