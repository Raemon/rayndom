Lauren was amazing and we couldn’t have pulled off the wedding of our dreams without her. She met with us two months before our big day and walked us through all the components of a wedding to make sure we didn’t have any surprises day-of. Everything went smoothly and she did an amazing job navigating personalities and a challenging venue gauntlet of restrictions, ensuring the bride and groom to enjoy a perfect day.

​As the mother of the bride, I can’t thank Lisa enough for making my daughter’s wedding day perfect! She went above and beyond to capture my daughter’s vision for her ceremony and reception with every detail. Lisa was easy to work with—her guidance in decision-making made planning so much easier, and her hard work setting up the venue was remarkable. Lisa came through with a last-minute decision for a Wedding Cake that was not only beautiful but delicious. Lisa is approachable, warm, and reassuring. If you want a planner who helps with your vision, hire Lisa—you won’t be disappointed!

Arkansas is in-between where the bride and groom are from. Neither family's live in or are familiar with Arkansas. I went to the the knot to find a local wedding planner, I picked Jillian because she's young with fresh ideas. That was definitely the right choice. She is very dedicated and handled everything thrown at her professionally and politely. She made this so much easier for us.

Working with Emily was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding! From the very beginning, she brought such a calming presence and helped put my mind at ease. She handled all of the behind-the-scenes details seamlessly, allowing us to truly enjoy and be present on our wedding day. Emily went above and beyond by creating a thoughtful and organized timeline, assisting with décor setup, coordinating vendors, and ensuring cleanup was taken care of at the end of the night. She was also a wonderful source of emotional support throughout the entire process, always checking in and making sure everything felt stress-free! Her professionalism, attention to detail, and genuine care made such a difference, and I truly can’t imagine our wedding day without her. I would highly recommend WGL to any couple looking for an exceptional wedding planner!

Madison is amazing at what she does! She helped us feel confident in the planning process and was always available for questions/recommendations/etc. in the months leading up the wedding. Once the wedding was around the corner Madison took the lead on coordinating with venues, nailing down final details with us, and creating a detailed plan of action. She made our wedding day and the lead up to it so stress free. She is a total pro and will make sure you have the best wedding experience possible. Definitely recommend hiring her!

I don't know what we would have done without Lulu's Events. Throughout the months leading up to the wedding, they were so helpful and resourceful with lining up vendors, getting quotes from vendors, and just sharing their knowledge. I've never seen people work so hard as they did the day of the wedding. I honestly don't know how they kept going. As the mother of the groom, I was very involved in the wedding preparations. On the wedding day, I was not stressed because they handled everything. It was beautiful. My son and daughter-in-law had a perfect wedding day and this was largely in part to the staff of Lulu's Events. I highly recommend their services for any celebration.

There's not enough time or words to describe how amazing Brittany is! She's an all around amazing human that made me feel like a long lost friend instead of just another client. I never really stressed during the entire planning process, even when unexpected problems came up, because Brittany handled everything with such confidence and creativity that I always had peace of mind knowing she was on my team. Brittany was absolutely PHENOMINAL to work with and I can't recommend her highly enough!

It was delight working alongside someone who makes the daunting task of wedding planning come off seamless. I never considered using a wedding planner until I saw all the BEAUTIFUL work The Pink Tea Rose has done. If you want someone who works with a spirit of excellence then look no more.

Beverly is an experienced wedding consultant that is trying to get started. We found her through a network of friends and she ended up being such a life saver. I had so many questions and hard decisions and she was able to offer answer or input on everything. Our wedding was at noon and on the day of I gave her a to-do list a mile long and she was able to complete everything and be dressed and ready to cue the wedding party. To save money I ordered bulk loose flowers and she offered to put them all together. My flowers could no have been more perfect. Over all she is easy to work with, is willing to go that extra mile, and most importantly she knows what she is doing! She may be new to the business but she knows her stuff! Give her a try, you wont be disappointed.
