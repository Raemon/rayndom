One of the most beautiful places in Boise to get married. Elizabeth was a dream to work with and made it easy to plan out our special day to our liking.

Comish Hall, is a unique and beautiful location to hold a wedding and reception. The grounds are beautiful, and the building is like nothing else. It is only 10 minutes off the interstate, but feels like you have landed in a quaint destination lotaction, far from everything. It is romantic and your guests will be sure to feel the mood. The owners are very accommodating, they have plenty of tables and chairs, this best part is you can choose your own caterer! They do provide table cloths if you need. The chairs are very pretty. The kitchen is awesome and stocked with all kinds of serving utensils it is very clean. The ceiling is draped in darling lights, over all it doesn’t require much decorating, unless you feel the need. My daughters wedding was amazing and the photographer was in heaven with all the fabulous photo opportunities! I highly recommend Comish Hall!

A fun and historical place to hold a gathering with your friends and family. It was especially nice to have the next day to do the final touches on clean up. When we held our event in July, it was especially nice to have the air conditioning. We did time our event so it wouldn't get interrupted with a train passing, but during the reception part of our event a train went by and the guest loved it.

So amazing! We had more than enough room for everything! There was an issue with plumbing due to a wedding before us, but the owners were quick to respond and fix it before I even noticed!
