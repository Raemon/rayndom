Jenn was absolutely wonderful to work with! From our first meeting and actually being able to see her flower gardens and picking out some flowers to the wedding day, she was great. I was a little unsure of what I wanted, but she helped my vision come to life. I’m a geologist and she even worked that into the bouquet by placing some amethyst crystals on ribbon where you hold the bouquet. She was very communicative throughout the process and was able to work well within the budget that I had. My bouquet and all of the other flower arrangements and bridesmaids bouquets were beautiful and I loved them. I highly highly recommend Morgan Country Gardens!

Flowers by Brian was a great team to work with and did an incredible job! For a couple that didn’t come in with a very strong vision of our flowers, they guided us through options and took time to make sure we felt good with the floral plan. The one thing we did come in with a vision for was our Chuppah, and the team executed it PERFECTLY!! The chuppah was perfect as were the bouquets, and table florals! The team was super communicative ahead of the wedding and made the process very easy and clear, and on the day of, made it all look beautiful and we barely even saw the magic happen. Would highly recommend working with Flowers by Brian!!

I am absolutely thrilled with how my flowers and décor turned out! Rich, who I worked with, was amazing from start to finish. I shared my vision for the ballroom, and he truly brought it to life. The arrangements were stunning, the colors were rich and elegant, and every detail was exactly what I envisioned. Throughout the night, guests kept coming up to me saying the room looked like it was straight out of a magazine. It genuinely took my breath away. I couldn’t be happier with how beautiful my flowers were and how gorgeous the entire ballroom looked. Thank you for making our wedding feel so magical!

Lucille was awesome to work with for our wedding florals. From our first conversation, she understood the vibe we were going for and offered thoughtful suggestions that made everything feel more cohesive and special. On the day of the wedding, every arrangement was gorgeous and exactly what we’d hoped for – from the bouquets and boutonnieres to the ceremony flowers and reception décor. Beyond the flowers themselves, Lucille was organized, responsive, and so easygoing, which made the whole planning process much less stressful. Everything was delivered and set up on time, and we didn’t have to worry about a thing. Would 100% recommend Lucille’s Florist to any couple in the area – she brought our vision to life and truly went above and beyond.

I cannot recommend Bella Flowers enough! From the moment I met them, they instantly felt like family. They took my vision and truly brought it to life — every flower, color, and detail was absolutely perfect. They were so flexible and worked within my budget while still giving me exactly what I dreamed of. The day before my wedding, I realized I had forgotten to buy a flower girl basket, and Lisa went above and beyond — she got it for me without hesitation! That kind of kindness and professionalism is so rare. Everything was stunning, and I’m still getting compliments on the flowers. Truly amazing people and an incredible experience from start to finish.

Having Flowers By Danielle to do my floral arrangements was the best decision I made to make my day extra special. Danielle and her team worked SO well in ensuring my vision was what it was supposed to be. They took their time, communicated so well and were so creative in their arrangements. They were so well organized, especially when they delivered the flowers to the hotel (with names on each) All of the flowers were absolutely stunning. Thank you so much Danielle and team!!

Arcadia provided beautiful floral arrangements for our wedding at Tappan Hill Mansion on 10/31/25. Adrienne helped us create custom centerpieces, a gorgeous archway, and a unique bridal bouquet. The floral arrangements were stunning and fit the vibe of our elegant, Halloween themed wedding. We highly recommend Arcadia for quality floral arrangements!

I had my wedding in Mar 2025 and a number of my friends recommended Lori to me. She merged with QG Florals in the midst of working with her but everything was seamless and she committed to everything she promised. I gave her a vague idea of what I was interested in. She asked for some picture samples of what we were interested in. From there, she brought everything together and gave us ideas to help complement my bridemaids' dress colors and work with our venue's style. She was truly magnificent to work with as she guided us thoroughly through the process. She gave us a sample viewing of the flowers - we were in awe! But on the day of, we were beyond impressed, Lori over-delivered beyond our expectations. I can't recommend Lori enough and her price-points are very reasonable.

Working with Dalsimer Spitz and Peck was an absolute dream,l and they delivered a total home run for our wedding. From start to finish, John was incredibly communicative and attentive to every detail. I shared my vision with him and what he created completely blew my expectations out of the water. Every floral element, from the ceremony to the reception, transformed the venue into something straight out of my wildest dreams. I was truly in awe. So thrilled with how everything turned out and already trying to figure out a way to work together again in the future!
