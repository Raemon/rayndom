Kat is an amazing and friendly individual. She has a passion for the work that she does and provides an amazing service with the quality and professionalism one would want for any event. I've booked her for multiple events and will continue to book her for future events. She offers multiple chain options in various metals and even has a wide selection of charms to choose from. Kat explains the process of attaching the jewelry (which is quick and easy) and has mentioned that she will reattach pieces for any reason. I cannot recommend Twisted Permanent Jewelry enough for your next event!

We chose Munson’s chocolate for our wedding favors. The chocolate is the best of course but what stood out is the unbelievable customer service we received. Munson’s was the easiest wedding vendor we dealt with. The wedding was out of state in summer so there was some concern as far as timing and melting. Everything went perfect, the staff I dealt with on the phone were pros. Thank you for everything

The jewelry for my bridesmaids and me came out beautiful! After a short conversation about the style and colors for my wedding, Carrie was able to put together beautiful original pieces that fit my wedding perfectly. My bridesmaids loved the fact that the jewelry didn't look like typical "bridesmaid" jewelry and could be worn well after the wedding was over. Her quality and craftsmanship of the pieces are far better than what you could buy in a store. I highly recommend Carrie W designs if you are looking for one of a kind elegant pieces that will enhance your overall look on your wedding day!

Super easy to work with, the prices were extremely reasonable, and everyone loved receiving a mini bottle of champagne. I couldn't see spending money on a favor that people couldn't use. We did mini bottles of Cook's champagne and personalized labels for our day were included. The ordering process was seamless and they arrived fully intact. I couldn't have asked for anything better. Would recommend to any bride :) Jessica and Steven

MELT Chocolatier provided the most adorable (and delicious!) truffles we've ever seen. Our guests LOVED them. Meredith was amazing -- she listened to all of our ideas, helped us come up with the perfect favor, and suggested putting some of them in our "welcome bags" that we made for our guests from out of town. They were such a hit. The truffles themselves were gorgeous and perfectly packaged - soo cute! They smelled unbelievably rich and delicious. She even gave us a few extra to be sure we had enough - perfect for last minute changes. She also surprised us with our own truffles, which were the perfect end to a perfect evening!

Sassy Sugar Scrubs is awesome!! I purchased the lavender one for myself and a few more for gifts. The oils used in the scrubs makes your skin so soft, but doesn't leave a greasy or oily feeling on you. I am now using the fresh cut roses which smells awesome! I would highly recommend the scrubs to anyone!!

My reception was made even more fun due to the beautifully designed cupcakes soaps by Deborah. Plus, they smelled fabulous!
