My fiance and I were married last month at Casa and it was amazing! Virginia and Kara, and all of the staff were amazing since the moment we first went to tour the venue about 8 months before our big date. They were all so extremely professional, kind, responsive and very helpful in our planning throughout. Casa offers everything included, or you can further personalize. We chose to use everything that is provided (white linens, chairs, china, etc). We were not disappointed. Everything looked so elegant. And the food - the food was amazing. All of our guests raved about how delicious the food was (we offered our guests a choice of chicken gruyere as well as the filet mignon). They also accommodated several people with multiple allergies (we were told by the guests that the chef came out and directly spoke with them to walk through the ingredients). This and other personal touches throughout the night helped make our night so memorable. It is a beautiful venue with lots of options! I was very concerned at first on how such a large space could accommodate my relatively small wedding of 93 people. But it worked perfect! We chose to have an ivory curtain that blocked off the cocktail hour inside, but it would have been fine without. The vineyards were perfect for sunset photos. We really can't say enough good things about this place. We highly recommend having your wedding here especially if (like us) you want/need the extra help in planning your day. They treated us wonderfully. We loved how we were able to enjoy cocktail hour while taking photos. There were two servers that accompanied us during pictures with a cart food of food and drinks - such an awesome touch! Having a day- of coordinator was another great part of Casa's wedding package. We loved how we were just able to show up and enjoy our wedding! The staff made it about as stress free as a wedding could possibly be. Our wedding was on a Thursday evening which offers a discounted rate - it was a fantastic value for what we got. We highly recommend Casa!
