"OOH AWWW" The Club at Ruby Hill

In September of this year, I hosted a 100-year birthday celebration for my mother that was attended by 200+ family and friends. People are still raving about it and referring to it as the "Event of the Year." Prior to the venue selection, I combed the entire Tri-Valley for two months(2), looking for the perfect venue to host the perfect event. I wanted a venue that not only elevated my vision but also accentuated it. My key requirements were many including cost, size/capacity, location/accessibility, staff support/flexibility, ambiance/decor and food and beverage preparations. After visiting many beautiful venues, I found only one that could meet all of my established criteria....The Club at Ruby Hill. A special shout out to Kymberlie Avila(Sales Director) and Samantha Perreira((Events Manager), for being incredibly attentive and professional. They both intuitively recognized my stresses and ALWAYS seamlessly solved my "henny penny, the sky is falling" problems, with care, concern and a smile. Of particular note, many of my guests favorably commented on the friendly, efficient service provided by the wait staff that were responsible for the food service and table management. I can save you some time by promising you that if you are looking for a beautiful, one-stop shop, "OOH AWWW" venue, that cares as much about your event as you do, save yourself some time and visit THE CLUB AT RUBY HILL. You will be happy that you did

A Night to Remember

Our Graduation Gala at The Club at Ruby Hill was nothing short of extraordinary. The venue is truly stunning—a space that elevates every event it hosts. From the moment guests arrived, the beautifully appointed interiors and breathtaking grounds created a sense of elegance and celebration that was absolutely picture-perfect.  
  
The food was incredible, both in presentation and flavor. Guests raved throughout the night, and the compliments continued long after the evening was over.  
  
The staff at Ruby Hill were exceptional—warm, attentive, and unfailingly professional. They anticipated needs before we even voiced them and ensured that every moment flowed seamlessly.  
  
A special thank-you to Kimberlie and her team, whose expertise and graciousness made the entire planning process so easy and so fabulous. Their thoughtful guidance elevated the experience even further and helped us create a night our students and families will never forget.  
  
It was a magnificent celebration—beautifully hosted, flawlessly executed, and truly unforgettable. We cannot recommend The Club at Ruby Hill highly enough.

The best place to get married 

I don’t even know where to start with this place and people that helped us. From day one till the day of our wedding and a year after, they definitely made us feel beyond special. The responded to every question of ours within 2 hrs. The place is beautiful, customer service beyond great. A year has passed and my guests are still talking about the place and the food. To die for … and on top of that they invited us back to the facility for a beautiful romantic dinner to celebrate our one year anniversary. I’m beyond grateful of this place and people who helped me especially Samantha Souza (Perreira). 10000000/10

The Club at Ruby Hill: The Perfect Backdrop for Life's Biggest Celebrations

The Club at Ruby Hill makes a stunning impression from the moment you arrive at its elegant gated entrance. Nestled within a picturesque neighborhood, the property boasts breathtaking views, a stately Clubhouse, beautifully appointed banquet spaces, and a pristine golf course. The venue’s culinary offerings are equally impressive, featuring a versatile menu to suit any occasion.  
  
Kymberlie Avila and her exceptional catering and events team are a true pleasure to work with—accommodating every budget and vision with ease. For couples or hosts looking to incorporate golf into their celebration, Kymberlie collaborates seamlessly with Nigel Rouse and his golf team to create an experience that’s as memorable as it is magical.

Great Wedding Venue

We had a truly wonderful experience at Ruby Hill for our wedding. The entire staff was incredibly friendly and did an outstanding job from start to finish. Samantha, the event coordinator, was especially helpful—she guided us through the entire planning process with professionalism and care.  
  
The food was absolutely delicious, and the Ruby Hill team did an excellent job with both the meal service and the setup of tables and chairs. On the day of the wedding, Lenny and Juan were very supportive, working closely with our own coordinator, Theresa, to ensure everything went smoothly.  
  
Overall, we couldn’t be happier with our experience and highly recommend this venue to anyone planning their special day.

5/24/24 wedding

We just had our wedding at The Club at Ruby Hill. We were initially had another venue already booked, however, they decided to do last minute construction which resulted in cancellation. We were lucky to come across this gorgeous venue who thankfully had the date open. It was my pleasure to work with Carolyn and Samantha.   
  
Samantha is so kind and friendly, she was very helpful throughout this process. This is a beautiful venue and so picturesque. We are so happy that we had our wedding here. The entire staff is very friendly and polite. The food was so delicious, chef James did so well and beyond our expectations. Every guests raved about the food. Our overall experience with the venue was excellent.

Perfect Venue for an Elegant Wedding

My wife and I were so happy that we chose The Club at Ruby Hill as our wedding venue. The venue itself was beautiful with a subtle, elegant feel. It's located in a private, gated community surrounded by a picturesque golf course, and the inside was spacious and perfect for a large gathering. We had our tea ceremony in the lobby, the larger ceremony outside, and dinner and dancing in the main ballroom.   
  
The team at the Club at Ruby Hill was responsive and very easy to work with. The on-site menu tasting was my favorite part of the process because we got to try a majority of the menu, meet the chef, and connect with the team that helped facilitate the behind-the-scenes operations at our wedding. They provided personalized menus and gifted us a bottle of champagne so the day felt really special. We spoke to mainly Samantha and Tiffani, and both were a pleasure to work with.   
  
Highly recommend for those looking for a wedding venue!

Ruby Hill is an incredible venue to see and to work in! The building and grounds themselves are beautiful, clean, and well kept! Melissa and her staff are very accommodating and professional, they are always on top of everyone's needs! I always enjoy working on the bride and her bridal party in the Ruby Hill bridal suite as well! It's very spacious with lots of natural light which is very important for makeup! The bride's always love to hang out with their ladies, sipping champagne and having snacks while they all get ready together!
