I would highly recommend the Pink Palace for a wedding. The staff is very easy to work with & always responded immediately to any questions we had. David Branch & Alec Aster were both great. Alec was very helpful during the rehearsal & night of the wedding.  
The Pink Palace is such a beautiful venue! We were just so happy with the entire event.

Thank You Pink Palace!

The Pink Palace was on the higher end of our venue budget, but I am very happy we used them. If you are looking for a venue that allows for both a ceremony and a reception, this is your spot. We used it for a reception only so I didn’t get to make use of the beautiful bridal suite but the beauty and spaciousness of the venue was worth it. Our guests still comment on it even a year later. In addition, they allow you to select your own caterer and bring in your own alcohol, which will save you money. I was very pleased with the coordination both before and during our wedding day. The responsiveness was above average, which will pay off in stress reduction.

Elegant wedding venue

We decided to use the Pink Palace as our venue early in our wedding planning. The cost was VERY affordable compared to other venues in the area, and it's a great option for people who are worried about rain, as there is plenty of room for outdoor OR indoor ceremony if rain happens to catch you on your big day. They included the price of the tables, table linens, and chairs in the venue rental, which was a huge money saver. Also, we had our wedding here right after a fresh rennovation, so the space was very fresh and newly painted. Upstairs, they have a beautiful suite for each wedding party to get ready in and lounge in on the big day, which was awesome. Also, they let us arrive early at the venue to start doing hair & makeup on site despite it being technically outside of the contracted time. That kind of flexibility was very nice and made the venue worthwhile for sure. The ballroom is large and has plenty of space for seating and dancing. The entrance to the palace has a beautiful staircase that made for wonderful pictures. Additionally, there are a few separated alcoves that are nice if you have guests that want to stay away from the larger crowds of the wedding, though you can easily rope it off if it's too much space for you. Overall, this was a wonderful space for a wedding, and the team over the events was great. There was one person that was slower at responding to emails, but the main event organizer was super responsive and open to questions.

Great staff that are very detail oriented. They take care of all the set-up, including 'back up' plans for weather. They are very experienced in planning events at the facility and I feel well taken care of. Beautiful location! No need to spend much on decorations because it is so nice as it is. Their fee includes tables, chairs, lighting, setup, clean up, layout planning, linens and you can bring in your own alcohol/bar and they have a good variety of caterers on their approved list (for all budgets). Great value!
