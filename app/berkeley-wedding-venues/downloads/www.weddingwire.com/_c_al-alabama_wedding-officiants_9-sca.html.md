We hired Jasmine for both decor and officiant services and we’re genuinely so glad we did. She took the time to really get to know us and helped us rewrite our vows in a way that actually sounded like who we are. The ceremony felt calm and personal and the timing was perfect. Not too fast, not too long. Right before everything started, she checked in with each of us separately just to make sure we were okay and grounded. We’re both pretty shy, so that small moment helped a lot. Our guests told us afterward that the ceremony made them emotional because it felt so real and not like a script. The decor was just as amazing. We gave her a color palette and a few inspiration photos and she somehow made everything look even better than what we showed her. The setup was done early, everything looked beautiful, and we didn’t have to lift a finger. The only thing we wish we had done differently was booking her bartending team too. Since everything else was handled so smoothly, it would’ve saved us the extra hassle. Overall, Jasmine made the whole day feel easy, personal, and really special. We’d definitely recommend booking as many services with her as you can.

Working with James was an absolute pleasure. From the first time I reached out to him to after the wedding, he was truly a joy to work with. He did a fantastic job during the ceremony, and did everything we asked for. We had so many compliments from guests wanting to know who he was and how we found him. My wedding coordinator loved him so much, she is saving his contact information to pass along to any brides she works with that needs an officiant. We highly recommend him!

Victoria and her son, Jake, were really great to work with. They made it very easy to have the exact ceremony that we wanted. They never told us "no we can do that", and when you are stressed about so many other things that is the best thing. They were very easy about coming out to rehearsal and making sure that everything was how we wanted it. I would recommend them for anyone's wedding.

Rev. Wolfe provided an excellent service; he responded in a timely manner and was flexible with us on the time and place. We wanted something fast and very simple and he was able to provide this. Thanks so much! Would recommend his service to everyone.

My husband and I wanted to have a biblical wedding that focused on where God had brought us in our faith over the past few years. Rabbi Brian had a clear understanding of the testimony we wanted our ceremony to be. It was a beautiful God honoring day. I definitely recommend him for any one who is a messianic or hebrew roots believer or in messianic judaism.

Darlene was wonderful! I am so glad I found her thru thumbtack. She helped me feel comfortable and was very helpful. She had lots of ideas and will be flexible in what is needed. I would definitely recommend her for weddings. I felt bad that we had her crying in our ceremony while she was trying to read. It made it more special for us.

Sonya did an awesome job for our big day! She was very helpful with recommendations for the ceremony. She was very sweet and professional. She was timely for our meeting to discuss the ceremony and also on our wedding day. She was very flexible and we would recommend her services to any couple looking to get married.
