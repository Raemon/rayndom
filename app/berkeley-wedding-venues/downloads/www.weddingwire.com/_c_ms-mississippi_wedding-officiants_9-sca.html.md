Ms. Susan was the most wonderful officiant in my wife n mine’s quaint marriage ceremony. We called her that morning to set it up for a later time to meet at the beach. Her soft spoken words carried through crystal clear that windy day.

So I am a procrastinator by nature and it was no different when it came to finding someone to perform our wedding ceremony. We were blessed when Rev Joe said he was available on our wedding date. He was so quick to respond and help us plan out the ceremony via phone and email since we were out of state. We were able to make changes where we wanted and he helped us find the perfect place for a rose ceremony we wanted to do (he had never done one before but pulled it off like he'd done it many times before!) I received many compliments on our ceremony and Rev Joe, I am so happy to have found him.

If you’re looking for the right service provider, this is it look no further. Misty and her hubs went above and beyond anything we could have imagined for us when we had to change the location due to weather. They are down to earth and made our experience SO SMOOTH. We decided to tie the knot at PATIO 44 in Gulfport and you would have thought that was the plan all along. Misty made the experience romantic, personable, and above all els fun and enjoyable. Could not imagine a better service. ABOVE AND BEYOND ON ALL ASPECTS. Misty, thank you from the Webb’s.
