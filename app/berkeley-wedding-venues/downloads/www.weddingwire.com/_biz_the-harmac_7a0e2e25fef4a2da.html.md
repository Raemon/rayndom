Combining contemporary amenities, industrial chic, and historic charm, The HarMac is a unique wedding venue located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. With vintage furnishings and brickwork, this loft space offers an aesthetic that truly stands out in the Iowa City and Cedar Rapid area. Venue management invites couples to make this industrial event space the setting for a truly remarkable occasion.

**Facilities and Capacity**

Two spaces are joined in this locale to provide each couple with excellent versatility for planning their wedding festivities. An abundance of light enters through many large windows, making a great setting to make memories and take photographs. Not including the rooftop, these spaces are respectively 2,900 and 6,600 square feet in size. These can host events for between 40 and 400 guests. The rooftop can host an entire wedding ceremony and cocktail hour, with opportunities for golden hour photos and city views close to downtown Chicago. In addition to the photographer-friendly surroundings, these event spaces have access to upscale bar experiences. Additionally, a couple can refresh and prepare in two get-ready rooms, both fully-equipped suites with plenty of mirrors, seating, lighting, and other amenities. A 600-square foot catering kitchen offers plenty of space for a couple's selected caterer to prepare wedding dining.

**Services Offered**

The HarMac staff offers a variety of services to enhance a couple's special day. They will provide the use of get-ready rooms, chairs, tables, floor-lenght linens, glassware, and flatware. More event rentals are available at a discount from their sister company, Unique Events.

The HarMac is great!

We are a wedding planning company, and the HarMac team doesn't know I'm writing this. We highly recommend them for their professionalism, organization, and value. It's a gorgeous venue with tons of spots for the most beautiful photos. It's conveniently located in Cedar Rapids, easy to find, and has lots of parking. We love the space's versatility for designing and organizing a variety of events, especially our weddings. It's literally such a great blank space. I had a meeting with Lia yesterday about an upcoming 2026 wedding, and she was so accommodating with everything our couple was requesting for their big day. If you're searching for something that is in Eastern Iowa that isn't a barn, check this out. It's a wonderful option.

Love the HarMac!!

Our wedding at the HarMac was an absolute dream! From the moment we walked in for our first tour, we were in awe of the unique character – the blend of industrial charm and modern elegance is stunning. The exposed brick, steel accents and the abundance of natural lighting create the perfect ambiance. Travis was incredibly attentive, helpful, and informative during our initial tour. No other venue makes you feel so well taken care of right off the bat. Lia was our point of contact for everything, and she was always available to meet or answer questions and made the planning process seamless.   
The elevated bar experience was a highlight for us and our guests – it is a beautiful set up with a fantastic selection. The bartenders are amazing and every drink they serve is top tier. The rooftop was a perfect spot for sunset photos. The bridal party suites were super spacious and comfortable to spend the day in. The location of the HarMac could not be beat in downtown Cedar Rapids. There was plenty of on-site parking for all our guests and walkable to nearby bars/restaurants/hotels.   
We could not recommend the HarMac more! The team genuinely cared about making our day special, and their warmth and expertise put us at ease. They went above and beyond to make sure everything was just right. Our guests continue to rave about the amazing experience they had at the HarMac and so do we! We truly could not have imagined a more perfect place for our special day.

Review of The HarMac

After the initial tour of The HarMac we knew this was truly special and unique venue for our daughter’s wedding and only hoping they would choose this for their special day. Lauren and the rest of the HarMac staff provided the best service and expertise. The preparation and communication prior to the wedding enabled a very smooth day. All accommodations were made and everything exceeded our expectations. The natural lighting allows for beautiful photos, the industrial look and feel was so unique, the bridal suites are set up allowing plenty of room for several girls, the grooms suite had plenty of entertainment to keep them busy. The rooftop allowed for a perfect outdoor ceremony in October along with cocktail hour and sunset photos. The reception area was set up with chairs aligned as requested, opened and welcoming for all guests. The bar staff was busy and worked diligently on each order providing the best customer service even under pressure. Lauren was in constant communication throughout the day keeping everything on task as expected. If you’re looking for a wedding venue that combines industrial yet modern look with exceptional service, look no further. We couldn’t have imagined the day being more perfect! Lastly its pet friendly.

The Perfect Venue

The HarMac was the perfect space for our wedding reception. It has such a cool, industrial charm, incredible lighting, and the bar was top tier! The staff was incredibly professional and kind, and so flexible. The bridal suites are stunning, and the amount of photo backdrops and opportunities is staggering. I cannot say enough about how perfect our day was thanks to The HarMac crew. Definitely worth it!

HarMac Wedding

The HarMac was such a beautiful place to have our wedding and the service was amazing! The HarMac did the set-up, bartending, and bussing for us. The venue was beautifully set-up and the perfect space for our wedding. The main space was perfect for our 220 guest count with plenty of space for more. There is a room off of the main room perfect for a ceremony, cocktail hour, or socialization. Lia and Travis were so easy to work with, very responsive to our emails and questions, and made the entire experience incredibly easy and worry-free! I would absolutely recommend this venue to anyone getting married as the options and opportunities are so easy. I knew this was the perfect place for our wedding from the tour where they spent an hour taking the time to show me the space, talk through the bar, and take me on a full tour rather than the 5-minute tour we got at other venues. At the HarMac we got beautiful fresh drinks from the bar, sunset photos on the roof, and a photobooth full of photos of our friends. Lia and Travis were amazing and the HarMac made for the perfect day for our wedding!
