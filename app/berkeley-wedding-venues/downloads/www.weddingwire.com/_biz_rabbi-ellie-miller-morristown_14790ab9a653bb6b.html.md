Grateful for Amazing Rabbi Miller 

Rabbi Miller is a wonderful wedding officiant. She takes the time to get to know you personally leading up to the ceremony. She is a wise, kind and compassionate person and that comes through in the ceremony. She is flexible and creates a custom, meaningful, detailed ceremony plan for your wedding. Our ceremony was the most important part of the day. There were many things we wanted to include and important family members we wanted to honor. Rabbi Miller made it all happen and it was flawless. The ceremony was everything we wanted and more. Rabbi Miller cares about making the ceremony right for you. I really can't recommend Rabbi Ellie Miller enough. We will always be grateful that she officiated our wedding ceremony. Thank you Rabbi Miller. You are amazing!

Rabbi Miller was a joy to work with throughout the entire process! She made our wedding ceremony so personal, meaningful, and full of heart. She also made the pre-wedding process so effortless and just enjoyable to meet with her and plan. We couldn’t have asked for a better Rabbi. We could not recommend her more!!

Rabbi Miller - A Warm and Inclusive Wedding

I am writing to express my deepest gratitude for the extraordinary and unforgettable wedding ceremony you officiated for my daughter, Rachel and her husband Ryan Mulcahy. Your presence and guidance made the occasion even more special and meaningful for all of us. Even the pouring rain could not put a damper on such a joyous occasion!  
  
From the very beginning of the wedding planning process, it was evident that you were genuinely committed to personalizing the ceremony that truly celebrated the love shared between Rachel and Ryan. The Ketubah signing where you expertly explained the genesis of the marriage contract (Genesis!) and the touching top ten list of reasons the couple loved each other added a beautiful and heartfelt touches to the entire event.  
  
Your ability to seamlessly intertwine English and Hebrew throughout the ceremony was truly impressive. It not only showcased your extensive knowledge of both languages but also represented the harmony between the two families and their respective traditions. This skillful fusion created an atmosphere of unity and inclusivity, making everyone feel deeply connected to the ceremony.  
  
The way you officiated the wedding was equally remarkable. Your warm and compassionate demeanor, along with your genuine interest in the couple's love story, shone through during the entire ceremony. You artfully balanced reverence and joy, and your words resonated with each person present, creating an emotional experience that will be cherished forever.  
  
Your openness and understanding of an interfaith marriage made a significant impact on our family and friends. Your wisdom and guidance helped bridge any cultural gaps and encouraged the celebration of diversity, making the ceremony truly memorable and meaningful to everyone involved.  
  
Furthermore, your thoughtful incorporation of the top ten list of reasons the couple loved each other was an incredibly personal touch that touched the hearts of everyone present. It highlighted the depth of the couple's bond and brought smiles and tears of joy to our faces.  
  
In conclusion, I want to express my heartfelt appreciation for your exceptional dedication to making Rachel and Ryan's wedding day so remarkable and special. Your sincere understanding of interfaith marriages and unique ability to make all feel welcomed, left an indelible impression on all of us.  
  
I wholeheartedly recommend you as a rabbi to any couple seeking a deeply personalized and inclusive wedding experience. Your grace, wisdom, and genuine love for what you do make you a true blessing to all who have the honor of crossing paths with you.  
  
Once again, thank you from the bottom of my heart for being an integral part of such a joyous and memorable day. May you continue to bring happiness and love into the lives of others through your work.  
  
With utmost gratitude and warm regards,  
Debra Rosenberg

The Best Rabbi!

Working with Rabbi Miller was a great experience. We unfortunately are a coronavirus wedding couple and our original wedding date was 7/4/20. We had a large celebration planned with all of our friends and family. We ended up keeping our date this year and had an intimate ceremony with our close family. Rabbi Miller helped us design our ceremony this year, walking us through all of the traditions we could incorporate now and which we wanted to save for our second wedding. It was a beautiful ceremony! We can't wait to have her officiant our wedding again with all of our loved ones present!

Amazing Rabbi

Ellie was the perfect choice for my wedding. She was very kind, funny, and did the ceremony to perfection. She was a joy to work with, especially since we lived in a different state and contacted her last minute. I am so glad that we chose her as our rabbi for the wedding.

Wedding Ceremony Officiant

Rabbi Miller was incredible! My husband and I have been blessed to create a beautiful blended family together. Rabbi Miller lead such a warm and personal service that allowed all the kids to be a part of. The time she spent getting to know “our” story prior to our wedding day meant so much to both of us. We feel very fortunate to have met and worked with Rabbi Miller. Our day was so special and we will cherish it forever.
