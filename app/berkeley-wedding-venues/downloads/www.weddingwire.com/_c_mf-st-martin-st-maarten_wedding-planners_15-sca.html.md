We had the most beautiful destination wedding of our dreams and it was all thanks to Felicia and her staff at SXM Luxury Event Consultants. Throughout our time together, Felicia held our hands as she walked us through each step in the planning process while going above and beyond to execute our vision by hiring thoughtful vendors like the gorgeous florist to the excellent DJ, which made it hard to stop dancing! She took each worry or concern in stride while reassuring us at every turn that our wedding will happen how we want. Felicia made securing and working with our venue very easy; from planning each event location to working with venue event management to handle all logistics and setup/decor for the weekend. From the rehearsal dinner to the after-party, Felicia and team looked over every aspect like finding restaurant space to bussing logistics, to make sure each event ran smoothly and felt effortless. She consistently kept us updated of all the projects and timelines during the entire process which made it easier (and less stressful) to plan a wedding from a different country! Felicia and her staff are extremely thoughtful, smart, and professional. They completely exceeded our expectations of the weekend and made it so that we both could enjoy our wedding weekend with our family and friends, instead of stressing about logistics. After two-years planning a wedding and speaking almost every day, we can say Felicia has become a life-long friend and we cannot wait to get back to the island to celebrate with her again! You should definitely hire her to plan your next wedding!

We planned a simple vow renewal ceremony on the beach for my parents 50th anniversary while we were stopped at port during our cruise and everything was beautifully planned and the ceremony was flawless! They even planned transportation for us from the port to the beach and back for our group of 13.

Hi! Amelia and David here. We are two small town Alabama natives who wanted to ditch the traditional wedding route and get married in the sand. We are so grateful for Veronica and Paolo with the As You Wish Destinations team of fairies to make our day unforgettable in the most positive ways. Veronica and Paolo communicated with us via Skype monthly prior to our arrival on the island and then had an in person meeting once we arrived. My bouquet was exactly as I asked for. The beach ceremony was perfect. The ceremony was intimate and heartfelt just as we had wanted. Thank you so much for coordinating our wedding timeline and making our special day flawless and beautiful.

Beautiful, heartfelt vow renewal for our 20th anniversary! Loved the officiant, his words were thoughtful and perfect for the occasion. Shanice was a great help throughout the process. Photographer could have communicated better, felt like I was telling him where we should take the pictures. Would have liked to have had the archway as well, which I was told I was getting, maybe it was too windy. Sunset time event should be 6:30 not 5 in March as the sun was directly in my eyes during the event. Still worth the money and a fun day. Would use them again.

I don’t even know where to start this.. if you are getting married in St. Martin you NEED to work with Walker Events. Danissa and her team are incredible to work with and just a great group of people overall. I don’t know how we could have planned this wedding without Danissa and her team. The communication with them was great and they made every little detail perfect. The communication with our venue was not the best and Danissa was an incredible asset to help us with everything relating to the venue. Danissa was there to answer all of my questions and kept our wedding day as stress free as possible. She was able to help put us in contact with multiple people all over the island for different things we needed which was an amazing help. Her eye for creating the perfect decor with the visions you give her is unmatched. I could go on for pages more but I’ll just end by saying thank you guys for everything, you helped make our wedding day perfect
