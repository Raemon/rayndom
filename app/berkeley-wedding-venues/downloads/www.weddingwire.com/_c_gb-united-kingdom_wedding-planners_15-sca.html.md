We greatly enjoyed working with Jennifer for the flowers for our wedding.. She had beautiful ideas to help us decide...and not much time...we loved everything.. the pew decoration was outstanding, and done for us...another thing to take off our list to do..the flowers stayed fresh for over a week after the wedding... Please consider Kennedy's Floral..you will not be disappointed.

Jamie at Timeless White was absolutely incredible! We had the most perfect wedding weekend and I completely attribute that that Jamie, and the incredible vendors who he 100% recommended, sourced, and organized. After getting engaged, Timeless white wedding planning was the very first thing we booked and it was the best decision ever. From our first meeting with Jamie a year and a half ago, we immediately felt like we could see our wedding vision coming to life. Jamie was realistic within our budget and helped us prioritize what vendors and items were most important and would have the biggest impact on our wedding day. He immediately understood our eclectic, and vibrant style, and put together a dream team of vendors to curate a perfectly unique wedding weekend. Jamie organized and coordinated our Highland Games welcome party, rehearsal dinner, group whiskey tasting, entire wedding day and hangover recovery brunch. He brought fresh and unique ideas to every planning meeting, had clear and consistent communication and always was such a joy to work with. Jamie triaged every problem that came up effectively and truly made miracles happen in the chaos of our wedding weekend. We loved working with Jamie at Timeless White and 100% would recommend Timeless White for your wedding planning needs!

We had a perfect wedding thanks to Eva and her team. From start to finish, the level of professionalism and positive energy was outstanding. Nothing is a problem, no request is too much, we had a lot of fun already during the planning. We would like to recommend the White agency to everyone, because they create wonders. From the general approach to smallest details, including top-of-class contacts to venues, entertainment, catering, photographer, florist...you name it, they got it.

We had the most epic wedding and honeymoon. Even our pre-wedding with our family and friends was something we couldn't have dreamed of. The team made it about a collective experience and being so close with our loved ones, that is wha we needed, for everyone to feel part of the experience and not just guests. We can't thank you guys enough.

When I found Elisabetta’s website, I immediately felt a deep connection to her taste, passion and core beliefs. I felt right away that she is ultimately a storyteller and as a filmmaker that struck me as distinctly unique. I was not sure what to expect moving forward with a planner. We had not set a date yet and being a production designer, I knew my husband and I were very particular about the feeling of spaces and authenticity. I had apprehension about setting a date and the timeline that my husband was proposing. Honestly— I don’t know if my husband and I would be married right now had it not been for Elisabetta. Her encouraging us to follow our hearts then giving us a feeling to be safe to plan our nuptials within the year was instrumental to our growth and where we are at now. We had almost nine months from our initial consult but our connection to her gave us so much new energy and confidence that it carried us through the year in all of the uncertainty of our business. It became the only thing that my friends and family were looking forward to in otherwise very difficult 2023. We were all working from different countries (being an international couple) yet her consistent and supportive communication allowed us a sense of ease and togetherness. I have to say that when we started working with Elisabetta it was the first time I felt like someone was designing (a movie) about my life. I felt safe and inspired to share intimate details about our love story that helped her and her team weave together a story and visual concept that was purely us. Her level of craftswoman-ship went beyond planning our wedding. I found her skills to range from, a producer, director, designer… a therapist, stylist and relationship coach. She is a visionary and actually if I may add —-her quirkiness, worldliness and soulfulness makes her a literal artist in an industry that does not always value the personalized attention and invisible charge that you get from someone that is reading your mind, interpreting your soul while understanding a couple’s roadblocks and emotional framework. We simply cannot recommend Elisabetta and her team enough. The artists she brought together, the best vendors in the world made us feel like royalty. Our friends from all over the world have all told us across the board that it was the best wedding they have ever been to—ever…EVER. Elisabetta’s wisdom and experience working and living in many countries gives her a sixth sense and sensitivity that is unrivaled in today’s market. Love, Carmen and Peter Settman

We wanted to elope to Ireland because we didn't want a big wedding and found our perfect backdrop for the ceremony with peach perfect. Initially we planned with Lorraine who was great and she was replaced with Claire who was also amazing. On the morning of our wedding we had absolutely no worries because we knew the planner had only organised the best suppliers. Even though she was not there on the day (because we didn't select coordination) Claire let us know that she would be contactable throughout if we had any problems and I know that if there had been a problem she would have snapped into action. The photographer already provided some pictures and we can't wait to get more once the rest are ready.

I cannot recommend Svetlana and Vladimir enough. We travelled from Scotland to get married in Prague and everything was perferct, the bouquet, limo service, photography, the ceremony was at the beauriful Vrtba Garden and we had a lovely intimate dinner at a nearby hotel which catered for our dietary requirements. Everything was made so easy, it all went very smoothly and all of us thorougly enjoyed the day. You can have the simplest or most extravagant wedding you desire, Svetlana and Vladimir will cater for you with absolutely no stress to you!
