Hannah at Flora Designs was truly the best vendor we worked with for our wedding! She went above and beyond in every way, and her florals were the highlight of my special day. I was blown away by how stunning everything turned out! From the fun greenery installation above the dance floor to the detail in each bud vase and the floral spray on the cross—it was all absolutely perfection. Hannah’s vision, creativity, and attention to detail brought our entire wedding to life. I was pretty nervous about how everything would come together and Hannah was reassuring and wonderful to work with. I really appreciate all the hard work and highly recommend her to anyone!

Kesha was absolutely wonderful!! She was very quick to respond and super attentive to our needs. Her services are above and beyond what she charges and 100% worth it. She was professional but also made it a point to get to know us on a personal level to make sure everything was exactly up to our standards. We had a very strict budget and she did a great job working with our budget and getting us exactly what we wanted. She exceeded our expectations in every way and is one of the kindest people I’ve ever met. 10/10 would recommend her services to any couple looking to get married.

Ira did an OUTSTANDING job. We spoke on the phone a few times and she was so flexible with working with me and my budget. I sent her my vision and she absolutely nailed it. I got so many compliments on my flowers and I was blown away when she first showed me! Honestly one of the best parts of the day was our flowers, they were absolutely perfect.

Smiling Petals was an absolute pleasure to work with for my wedding. Owner Ruth went above and beyond to make our big day beautiful, special, and within our budget. She gave us countless options with different price points and different flower combinations. The final products were exactly what I envisioned; bridal bouquet, bridesmaids bouquets, boutonnières, centerpieces, sweetheart table, and large arrangements for ceremony decoration. The blooms were all fresh and beautifully arranged! Ruth was super responsive to me during the planning process (both text and email), and was always pleasant, professional, and courteous. I would recommend Smiling Petals to absolutely everyone. She will answer your questions and work to create the florals of your dreams. Take it from me, one stressed bride: booking with Smiling Petals was one of the best decisions we made during the wedding planning process and we’re so thrilled with how everything turned out!!

Thank You, Pretty Petals! While our venue offered incredible natural beauty, our florist truly brought our lavender dream to life. From my bouquet to the aisle markers, petal toss, and ceremony arrangements—it was everything I had hoped for and more. Pretty Petals of Charleston created a stunning setting that captured the charm of the UK right here in South Carolina. Their attention to detail and ability to bring our vision to life was unmatched. We’re so grateful for their work and would strongly recommend Pretty Petals to anyone planning their big day!
