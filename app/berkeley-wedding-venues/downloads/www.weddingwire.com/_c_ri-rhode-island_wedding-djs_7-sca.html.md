We found Bill/Rhythm Express DJ when looking for LGBT-friendly vendors for our October 2023 wedding and are so glad we did! We specifically were looking for a DJ that understood our crowd (queer younger millennials and our family in their late 50s-early 70s) and that also didn't feel the need to upsell us on uplighting, photo booths, or MC-ing more appropriate for a club atmosphere - which I know Bill also does for other weddings, but that wasn't us! Music is really important to us and we anticipated a dance-y crowd with the younger generations, but we pretty much exclusively listen to indie rock and Americana music with early 00s throwback hits. A lot of other weddings we've attended have been exclusively Top 40s that maybe only one of our cousins would recognize. Bill was incredibly graceful with the four playlists (guest requests, our ideas of cocktail hour, dinner, and dancing) we sent him and did an awesome job matching our vibe and curating our favorite songs. He also didn't blink at the incredibly long Do Not Play list and added the Cha Cha slide after a friend convinced me during dancing it would actually be fun to add back in after a rowdy Cotton Eye Joe (the only line dance we originally approved). So many people complimented us on the music choices and an older uncle asked if our friends could come to all the family parties since they all knew the words and dances so well! It was truly representative of our tastes and our crowd was having a blast. Bill was also very patient and kind day-of. He helped us stay on the timeline, while still being flexible when things came up. He also had a full audio set-up for our outdoor ceremony (which allowed everyone to hear the officiant and our vows, even when it was super windy!!). I really attribute the audio setup to some amount of tears and compliments we received on the ceremony itself. He also helped us monitor our audio recorder that we used for DIY videography, and the sound came out great! If you want a DJ that is incredibly organized (all his pre-wedding spreadsheets to gauge our tastes and what moments needed music were so helpful!); someone to manage your wedding timeline; someone who will provide microphones and speakers and an extensive audio set up for your ceremony and dancing (including for videography); someone who can read the room and honor your musical vision be that more traditional or not; and a DJ that is a calming presence yet still a hype man during your wedding day, we would definitely recommend Bill!!

From the very beginning, SolView Studios was professional, responsive, and easy to work with. Communication was clear throughout the planning process, and they took the time to understand our vision, preferences, and overall vibe for the night. On the wedding day, everything ran seamlessly. The setup was clean and polished, the sound quality was excellent, and the music selection was spot-on. They did an amazing job reading the room and keeping the energy exactly where it needed to be—from meaningful moments to full-on dance floor fun. Our guests were on the dance floor all night, and we received nonstop compliments about the music. If you’re looking for a DJ who is organized, skilled, and genuinely invested in making your wedding unforgettable, SolView Studios is an excellent choice. We would absolutely recommend them to other couples.

From the very beginning Luis has been the best! He is excellent at communicating, being professional, and organized! He truly was a joy to work with from start to finish - he brought the fire, the energy, and fun all night long! Our guests cannot stop RAVING about Luis - everyone had a blast on the dance floor all night! Countless people have asked us who are DJ was after the wedding was over because he was so great. The cold sparks and up lighting were a great touch as well! We cannot thank Luis enough for being a huge part of our night and making our wedding absolutely perfect! We seriously cannot recommend Luis enough!

Tom was phenomenal. We had read the amazing reviews about Tom beforehand and knew he was going to be good, but working with him completely exceeded our expectations. Music was always going to be an important part of our day, and Tom delivered beyond what we imagined. He played beautiful live music for our ceremony that fit the setting perfectly, then transitioned seamlessly to instruments and strolling saxophone during cocktails and dinner. Everyone loved it! Later, he had the dance floor packed all night as our DJ. He’s incredibly talented, versatile and wonderful to work with. Tom is a true professional. He listened to what we wanted, offered ideas based on his experience, and made us feel at ease. Our guests are still raving! It was the best blend of live and DJ’d music...perfect for all ages! We thought he’d be great, but he was even better - truly one of the highlights of our wedding!

We had the pleasure of working with Alex Diaz, after our pre- wedding phone call I knew he would be the best DJ for our New Years Eve Wedding! He didn’t disappoint, he had everyone dancing all night long! If you want the best party of the year you need Alex for your wedding! His energy, good vibes, and attention to detail make the day even better! Thank you Alex!

We went back and forth for months deciding between a DJ or a band for our wedding—and I can confidently say we made the BEST decision by going with Luke Renchan. From our first conversation, Luke was professional, attentive, and genuinely cared about understanding our vision. He brought incredible energy and created the most fun, unforgettable atmosphere. Our dance floor was packed all night, and so many of our guests are still raving about how amazing he was. If you’re on the fence like we were, trust me—go with Luke. You won’t regret it!

From the ceremony officiant, photo booth, and the extraordinary DJ service, the services from Arpeggio went above and beyond what we were expecting. They were everything we hoped for and more. Our guests had so much fun with the photo booth and so did we. The attendants were so kind and fun. The photo booth book is such a thoughtful keepsake and it makes us laugh and aww every time we go through it. The memories of dancing all night will always be with us. Rick was an incredible DJ and always kept people engaged and knew the flow of the night. Richard was so wonderful as our officiant. He was personal and funny and made the ceremony so wonderful. Debbie made this process so smooth and easy with being so communicative and attentive. It was so great working with this company for a plethora of reasons, but above all else, they were communicative, dedicated, and friendly.

My wife and I hired Alan to DJ for our wedding, and he could not have been more wonderful. He is incredibly accommodating, professional, kind, and just an all-around pleasure to work and interact with. He provided his mobile speaker for our pianist during the ceremony, and he even brought it out again at the end of the night so my wife and I could have a private dance away from the party. It was a lot to ask of him, but Alan did it eagerly and happily. That’s just the type of professional and person he is. If we ever need a DJ again, I will make sure to hire Moondance and ask for Alan specifically! Thank you again! \- S&K

From the first email many months ago, to the last song played on our wedding night, Jason crushed it. Jason was responsive and easy to work with through the entire process. Jason provided music at our off site ceremony and then was the MC and DJ at our reception. Jason’s software was simple to use and made it easy to plan the nights events. We had several special dances/entrances planned that required songs to switch at certain points and Jason nailed all of the transitions. My wife’s only wish for the wedding night was for the dance floor to be full and Jason made sure her wish came true. From the first song to the last, the dance floor was completely full. While we picked much of the music, Jason picked the order and transitions and it made sure that everyone was on their feet the entire night! In the planning process, we opted to go with up lighting. Jason provided recommendations for gentle white lights for the beginning of the reception, through dinner, transitioning to blue after dinner, at the start of dancing. This recommendation complemented our theme perfectly and made for some great photos. Jason came recommended by several friends and locals and it was easy to see why. At this point, stop your search, shoot Jason a call or email and hire him as your DJ. You will not be disappointed.
