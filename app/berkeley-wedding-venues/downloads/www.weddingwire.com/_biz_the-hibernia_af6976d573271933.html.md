A Memorable Wedding Reception

I recently had the pleasure of hosting my reception at the Hibernia in San Francisco, and I cannot speak highly enough of my experience with them. From start to finish, they were an absolute delight to work with.  
  
First and foremost, the team at the Hibernia was incredibly responsive and attentive to our needs. They listened carefully to our vision for the event and went above and beyond to ensure that every detail was executed flawlessly. Our guests were in awe as they were greeted with valet, walked up the red carpet, and entered into this beautiful interior enhanced by Jason's amazing light work.   
  
One aspect that truly stood out was their accommodation of our ideas. They not only welcomed our creative input but also provided valuable suggestions and guidance to enhance our vision even further. It was evident that they were genuinely invested in making our event memorable and unique.  
  
Moreover, the Hibernia proved to be the easiest vendor to work with throughout the entire planning process. Their professionalism, efficiency, and proactive approach made the experience stress-free and enjoyable.  
  
I also want to commend the Hibernia for their commitment to helping us stick to our budget. They offered cost-effective solutions without compromising on quality or service. This level of transparency and integrity was truly refreshing and greatly appreciated.  
  
Additionally, our other vendors echoed our sentiments and expressed how much they enjoyed collaborating with the Hibernia team. Their seamless coordination and teamwork contributed to the overall success of the event.  
  
In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend the Hibernia to anyone seeking a venue for their special occasion. Their responsiveness, accommodation, encouragement of ideas, and dedication to staying within budget set them apart as a top-notch establishment in the industry. Thank you to the entire team at the Hibernia for making our reception an unforgettable experience!

The best ballroom in the whole Bay Area! 

The Hibernia was the perfect place to host our August 2023 wedding reception. We looked at venues all across the Bay Area, and the Hibernia was the best ballroom around by a mile. It's a well kept secret - we were shocked we were able to get a booking given how amazing it is on the inside! No hotel ballroom, this; soaring stained glass domes, high ceilings, columns, marble counters, floors, and more. It delivered a level of old-world elegance that was perfect for our celebration. We turned the brick basement into a speakeasy for our cocktail hour full of funky drinks and music, then brought our guests up the staircase for a grand reveal of the ballroom. The size was perfect for our 220 guests, who danced the night away. We loved the acoustics: the soundproofing completely hid the noise of San Francisco, leaving us in our own world. The room amplified and accommodated our live band without a hitch. And, we were able to party past midnight!

Beautiful venue, great staff!

From start to finish, our experience at The Hibernia was great! It started with a tour where we were shown the entire building and were able to discuss date options with staff. We knew right away that this was the perfect venue for our wedding - the building is absolutely gorgeous, with beautiful details throughout and a rooftop deck that was perfect for our cocktail hour.  
  
Staff at The Hibernia were able to work with us to put together a package that met our requirements and budget. Throughout the months leading up to the wedding, they were helpful in getting prepared, including working with our caterer to order all necessary glassware and doing a final walkthrough a few weeks before the event.  
  
On the day of our wedding, The Hibernia's day-of coordinator Eli was with us from start to finish and really helped the day run smoothly. He worked with vendors as they arrived and made sure that things progressed on schedule. At the end of the night, he and his staff graciously offered to finish the cleanup so that we could go out and celebrate with our friends.  
  
Our guests raved about the beautiful building, great bar service, and central location! We'd highly recommend The Hibernia, and we hope we have a chance to hope to host (or at least attend) another event here.
