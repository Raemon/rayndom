Wedding Planner - Highly Recommend! 

I am a Bay Area wedding planner and have planned several weddings at The Lodge at Sonoma over the last couple of years. This venue is an amazing option if you are looking for a Sonoma venue that is a one stop shop! The property is a lovely hotel for your guests, several event spaces for different parts of your day, food and beverage services in-house, furniture for your event and a team that works hard to go above and beyond for each couple. The heritage oak tree is a beautiful place for ceremony or cocktail hour and the lawn is a beautiful place for an outdoor dinner. It is also one of the few places that has an indoor space that allows the party to go later into the evening. On the event team, Katelyn is an absolute standout! She cares so much about her couples, and her job - she makes sure that each wedding day or event goes seamlessly.

We love The Lodge

We are so happy we chose The Lodge for our wedding. It checked off all the boxes we were looking for out of a wedding venue. It is beautifully designed with a space that provides the perfect indoor/outdoor flow. It is spacious but still feels intimate, and the location was very easy for our guests to get to. Since it is also a hotel, we were able to stay on property which made the whole wedding weekend even easier.   
The team at The Lodge went above and beyond to ensure our wedding day was flawless. Katelyn was great to work with and it was so reassuring to know we were in such capable hands.  
On our wedding day, the venue was set up beautifully, exactly as we had imagined. The ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner, and dancing locations are all so close together which makes transitioning between spaces easy. The size of the stone building also allows flexibility in the event of inclement weather.   
We received so many compliments from our guests about how beautiful the venue was. Also, while the food at weddings is normally pretty mediocre, we received several compliments about how great the passed hors d’oeuvres and dinner were.   
We highly recommend The Lodge!

Sky-High Service!

Working with Katelyn and her team at The Lodge at Sonoma for an October wedding was wonderful and seamless! Their process is well-versed on the needs of a wedding from the event perspective AND from the hotel guest perspective. It was amazing to be so relaxed during the planning process! Even with unexpected rain at the dinner, which was managed wonderfully! You won't regret a wine country wedding of your dreams at The Lodge!

Event manager extraordinaire 

I have worked with Caitlin on multiple occasions, and she is always excellent. She is not only professional, but she's kind. She is responsive, helpful, and has great energy. You are in great hands when you're working with her on a wedding rehearsal dinner or even a brunch. I can't recommend her enough to any of my couples.

Absolutely Spectacular 

The Lodge is THE venue in Sonoma. The confidence in knowing that its service and team is backed by Marriott is worth every penny. The team outdid themselves for our family. No request was deemed too small. Parking food service bar location rooms nothing else compares.

Overall great experience

I booked The Lodge Resort for my wedding reception in June 2023. I had the most special and memorable wedding day! It was beautiful, elegant, and could not have gone better. The Lodge offered detailed and transparent packages that made all the decisions of wedding planning easier to manage. I recommend the catering sales manager, Michelle Sand. Michelle fostered the relationship between my family and The Lodge throughout the entire wedding planning process, from start to finish. She was responsive, timely, and alleviated any worries that come with planning a big event. I think the biggest perk of The Lodge is that the venue is well rehearsed in weddings and already have well established relationships with other local vendors. Also, the food and drinks were phenomenal!

An Enchanting Venue Surrounded by Unforgettable Experiences!

I am overjoyed to share my extraordinary experience with The Lodge at Sonoma, the picturesque setting where our dream wedding unfolded flawlessly! Despite a rocky start in our initial contact and a period of communication lapses due to turnover, our journey took a delightful turn when Michelle joined the team. From that point forward, everything fell into place seamlessly, leading to an absolutely perfect day that left our guests enchanted with the food, service, and the unforgettable experiences at the Lodge.  
  
The accommodations at the Lodge were nothing short of extraordinary, with cozy and chic rooms that provided the perfect blend of comfort and luxury. The Lodge at Sonoma truly set the stage for a perfect wedding weekend.   
  
Our rehearsal dinner and welcome reception on Friday at the onsite restaurant, Wit & Wisdom, was the perfect prelude to our celebration. The delectable cuisine, paired with the warm and inviting ambiance, set the tone for a weekend filled with love and joy. Our guests raved about the mouthwatering dishes, the impeccable service, and the delightful atmosphere that Wit & Wisdom effortlessly created. It was an unforgettable beginning to an unforgettable weekend.  
  
Now, our wedding day. The staff at the Lodge seamlessly brought our vision to life, ensuring that every aspect of our day was nothing short of magical. The food and service were absolutely exceptional, earning rave reviews from all our guests. Our guests couldn't stop praising the menu, and the service staff delivered with warmth, professionalism, and a genuine passion for ensuring everyone's happiness.  
  
Throughout the planning process, Michelle, our dedicated point of contact went above and beyond to help make our dreams a reality. Her attention to detail, open lines of communication, and ability to turn challenges into opportunities were truly remarkable.   
  
In conclusion, despite the initial bumps along the way, we are beyond thrilled with our experience at the Lodge thanks to the exceptional efforts of Michelle, Chef Megan and the entire team.

Started out rough... Finished wonderfully!

The short version... we picked this venue in 2021 and the communication and planning was awful - that is being nice... HOWEVER, once the now coordinator has been on board it was exactly what we wanted. She was very kind, caring (trust me, you need this for your wedding), helpful, quick, easy to work with, and had great attention to detail. The venue is GORGEOUS, the food was SOOO good, and we got a room block, which was SOOO FUN!!! We got to hang by the pool with our guests and it felt like a little love bungalow retreat, it was perfect. Highly recommend.

Gorgeous Sonoma Venue, Fantastic Team - Have a Wedding Your Guests Will Rave About

We had our wedding earlier this May at the Lodge at Sonoma, and it's the weekend that everyone is still talking about.   
We visited only a few venues in the region after much online research and the Lodge was simply perfection (even in the pouring rain - the pictures are already gorgeous, but really don't do it justice). When we initially signed our contract, there was a completely different team in charge of their events. The initial lack of communication left us with a little buyer's remorse, but the moment Michelle took over we knew we would be in good hands. She made up for the missteps of the prior team plus some. When we returned for our second visit and food tasting, it was raining yet again, but I was filled with the same excitement I felt when I first visited the property. I felt completely at ease with Michelle and her team. And the food....to die for. We could not wait for our wedding day just to have the food again, and on our wedding day the guests could not stop raving. We initially planned for our ceremony in the stone building and reception on the lawn, but once again the rain got the better of our time on the property and our wedding had to be moved inside. As a bride, this is an incredibly stressful and devastating thing to happen just before your wedding day, but Michelle and her team, along with our planner, seamlessly worked together to make it the event of our dreams. The staff were incredible, somehow invisible but also attentive to and on top of every need. Honestly, our only regret was not staying on property for longer after our wedding. Numerous guests have commented that they are already planning trips back to the property for vacations, anniversaries, etc. We cannot wait to be back.   
I would wholeheartedly recommend the Lodge to anyone looking for the perfect venue in the Napa Valley.

Luxurious, Modern Wedding Venue and Incredible Staff

We celebrated our wedding this April at the Lodge at Sonoma and had the incredible pleasure of working with Michelle Sand as our wedding coordinator. We cannot say enough great things about the venue and its staff—everything was perfect, down to the last detail. To start, the hotel and its grounds are modern, luxurious, and impeccably decorated. We hosted our reception dinner outside on the Stone Building lawn, which had the most classy, European feel. The food was straight out of a world-class restaurant—delicious and beautifully plated. Multiple guests told us that it was the best meal they’d ever eaten at a wedding. Later in the night, we moved inside the Stone Building for cake cutting and dancing, which was equally romantic and charming (bonus—because the building stands apart from the rest of the hotel, we were able to dance much later than other venues allowed)! Every member of the bartending and wait staff was incredibly kind, attentive, and professional, and ensured the night flowed smoothly. The Lodge’s Wedding and Event Coordinator, Michelle Sand, was particularly amazing. Simply put, Michelle went above and beyond to make our wedding day perfect. Although she was new to the Lodge when we first started working with her, she instantly took charge and proved to us with her professionalism and initiative that we were in the best of hands. Her experience, sense of taste, and attention to detail were extraordinary. She knew exactly how to set up the venue and organize the events of the night so that our wedding was something out of a bridal magazine. She was constantly one step ahead of us and always thinking about additional ways to make our day perfect, from ensuring we had heaters for dinner (something I hadn’t thought of, but we definitely needed!) to surprising us with an upgraded wedding cottage complete with champagne, chocolates, and rose petals. There are so many other ways she went far beyond her job description to give us the wedding of our dreams (and undoubtedly countless things that she took care of without us ever knowing), but suffice to say the night simply would not have happened without her. Wedding planning can be stressful, but Michelle’s hard work, honesty, and genuine care for her wedding couples made our entire experience easy and joyful. She was truly our fairy-godmother! To future couples looking for the most beautiful wedding venue, the most delicious food, and the most incredible staff, we highly recommend the Lodge at Sonoma!
