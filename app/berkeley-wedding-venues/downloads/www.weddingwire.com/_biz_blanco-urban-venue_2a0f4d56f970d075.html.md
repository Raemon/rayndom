Amazing wedding 

Great central location, good team for day or and planning up to the wedding day. If you want a venue where you can have options for vendors your hiring this is a good choice. The team day of was assertive on helping it go smooth and the security was awesome to have. The bartenders that came with the venue did such an amazing job keeping up with my guests. That was a huge deal for me as most of my guests were between 30-50 and like to have a good time so I wanted to make sure there was no line at the bar and good drinks being made. It went well and I'm sure happy with how the wddding went. Leanne my planner helped me so much and did such a great job. Couldn't have done it without her as well. Thank you for having us.

Elegant and Modern Venue 

We could not have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! When we started our venue search we were hoping to find a place that would allow us to do an outdoor ceremony but since we got married in November we wanted to have an indoor reception. Blanco delivered! Blanco offered the ideal mix of elegance, modern design, and a warm, inviting atmosphere. The space was stunning and provided a beautiful backdrop for every part of our day, from the ceremony to the reception. The staff was incredibly professional, responsive, and attentive to every detail, making sure everything went smoothly. We first spoke with Chrissy and then with Renee. They were both so easy to communicate with and incredibly responsive. Renee even helped me with my dress as I was preparing to walk down the aisle. This venue is truly beautiful! Our guests couldn’t stop raving about how beautiful the venue was! If you’re looking for a venue that blends urban charm with timeless elegance, Blanco Urban Venue is the place to go. Highly recommend!

Great modern and minimalist venue!

We discovered Blanco during our search for a modern, minimal venue that could accomodate an outdoor ceremony and indoor reception. It was very important to us that the outdoor area had some sort of shade solution since our wedding was in the summer, and Blanco’s rooftop was the perfect fit with the elegant roll out shades that could be retracted at night for rooftop festivities! We were also impressed with the care and detail the venue team put into upkeeping the space between events from what we saw the couple times we visited before our wedding day.  
  
Coordination and organization for payments and documents up until the event day was an absolute breeze. This wasn’t something I was expecting to be so appreciative of until I was deep into the wedding planning process. Blanco uses an online portal where you can make all of your payments, access invoices and receipts, and view upcoming payment due dates, making it very easy to keep track of everything.  
  
The Blanco team was also a pleasure to work with! We worked with Chrissy for the initial coordination, Renee for the preparation up until the event and then with both Renee and Hailey the day of. They were all so helpful and welcoming to make sure we had everything set and ready to go for the rehearsal and wedding day. Hailey even assisted me with my dress change as I was rushing between reception activities! They made sure we felt well taken care of and we couldn’t be more grateful!

Modern & flexible venue!

Great venue! We hosted our Hindu wedding ceremony followed by reception here. It's a very modern space that gives you the flexibility to be creative with your decor. When we were searching for venues, they were the only one that checked all our boxes...  
  
✅ high ceilings  
✅ no carpet  
✅ outdoor & indoor space  
✅ shaded rooftop  
✅ custom caterer allowed  
✅ in the city  
✅ full venue rental  
  
There are also plenty of hotels nearby for out of town guests. Highly recommend, you won't be disappointed 😊
