Best day of our lives!

If you are considering the white room for your wedding.. BOOK THE DAY.  
  
A few things that we loved on our special day.   
  
Our day of coordinator handled EVERYTHING. We did not have a traditional wedding planner but when we dropped off our supplies they knew exactly what to do. They moved items when needed, coordinated guests, worked with the DJ on announcements and kept the timeline moving.  
  
Service was WOW! We were married in the villa blanca after the ceremony we walked out to the balcony and were served Prosecco to take it all in!!  
  
We then had family and friends come down stairs for portraits on the grand staircase and sign the marriage license. Giselle our coordinator got us another drink and helped coordinate the guests.  
  
We didn’t want to miss cocktail hour so we were announced into the grand ballroom and before entering the catering team brought us some hand passed hor devoures to ensure we didn’t miss out on anything!  
  
The bartender was phenomenal. The bar was open during dinner, which is so important to us. And above all the food was 10/10 best wedding food anyone at our wedding had!   
We cannot thank the white room enough for our beautiful day.

Best wedding venue 

The White Room is the best venue in northeast Florida! We toured several other venues and nothing quite compares. Location, price, and experience is unmatched. Destiny was the absolute best coordinator! We had the pleasure of working with her from booking all the way until the end of our wedding night. She was there every step of the way and answered every question promptly and with professionalism. She assisted us with each choice and made sure everything was perfect.  
As the bride I did not worry about a single detail on our wedding day. She truly has a gift. I can not imagine a better venue or experience.  
Our guests have not stopped boasting about the night. hope I can attend an event at the White Room in the future!

Best Wedding Ever

The team was awesome through the entire planning phase. Provided tons of information regarding menu selection and answered all our questions. Giselle worked with us to ensure we had the perfect menu prior to the event. During the event everything was super smooth and worry free for the brides! I don't plan on getting married a 2nd time but if I did I would want to do it here.

10/10 would recommend for your wedding!

10/10 would recommend The White Room for your wedding or next corporate event! We had our wedding in September and we could not have asked for a better venue!  
  
From the food, the service, and the flexible options that they offer, it was an immaculate experience! Our wedding coordinator was extremely knowledgeable and was able to make our day run so smoothly.   
  
Overall, The White Room is one of the premiere wedding venues in Florida and is worth the very reasonable price point!

Amazing venue

The White Room is a stunning wedding venue with an exceptional staff. We had our ceremony in the Villa Blanca and reception in the Grand Ballroom and both spaces were perfect for what we wanted. Our vision for our wedding was executed perfectly. Rebeccah was very helpful during the planning process and a joy to work with. Everyone working on the day of our wedding were all great as well.

The Best Venue!

We had our ceremony in the Villa Blanca and reception in the Loft and Rooftop and it was perfect! Rebeccah was awesome to work with and great at answering all of our questions throughout the planning process. Rebeccah and Alan did an amazing job making sure we were well taken care of throughout the entire night, ensuring we had plenty of food and drinks which was very much appreciated. The staff and bartenders did a great job, they really are a well-oiled machine. The whole night was seamless and stress free, the food and drinks were great, the venue was absolutely beautiful, and we had the best time. We couldn’t have asked for a better venue and wedding day experience!

5 Stars Is Not Enough, EXCELLENT Dream Come True Vendor!!!

Where do I even begin!! The White Room was everything I could ever want and dream for my wedding. From the location, beautiful interior, AMAZING catering, great bartenders and bar and all around the vibe they provided my wedding. Meghan was my coordinator, words can't express how grateful I am that I had Meghan. She was FANTASTIC!! Answered all my crazy emails, listened to me vent over catering decisions, floorplans, guest list. She made me laugh and held my hand the entire journey. The sweetest, professional and amazing person you want to work with on your wedding. I can't say enough about her. The day of the wedding I had Alan as well who was AMAZING. He was so attentive to me and my husband, making sure we didn't need anything, taking care of our entire wedding party, Alan was PERFECT. I can't say enough about this venue other than its the perfect place, with the perfect staff, and the perfect venue for everyone's wedding. I wish I could relive the day over and over again because it was just that perfect. Wedding planning is beyond stressful, expensive and all around overwhelming but Meghan, Alan and everyone at The White Room made our day sooo perfect. Our wedding was over a month ago already and we are still getting compliments from our family and friends of how perfect everything was, how great the food was, the bartenders etc. BOOK THIS PLACE NOW!! Look no further! Than you so much to Meghan, Alan and everyone at The White Room for helping me start this new chapter in my life and giving me the perfect day!!

You should book here!

I can’t say enough wonderful things about the White Room! I’ll start with the entire waitstaff. The staff was phenomenal! My husband and I both manage restaurants, and most guests were in the hospitality industry so when it comes to service, we look at the small details. This staff crushed it!!! Every single staff member was beyond friendly! Guests were coming up to us and complimenting us on how detailed orientated the staff was (even though we had nothing to do with them). Small things like removing the salt and pepper shakers after dinner service was done and cleaning up small crumbs were all appreciated and certainly noticed. The bartenders were quick to serve and were very friendly! Everyone worked very hard that evening and it showed. Thank you to every single staff member that made our evening flawless!  
Rebeccah was our event manager and she was on point with everything. From all the back and forth emails to the rehearsal to the day of, she was on top of it. She was very responsive during the planning process and did the best she could to accommodate all of our needs. We planned for a ceremony in the Villa Blanca and the reception to be in the loft/rooftop. The day of the wedding it was torrential downpouring so the decision was made to move the reception into the Grand Ballroom. Although it was not what we originally wanted, I believe it was the best move for our group. All of this happened because of Rebeccah’s recommendation. Rebeccah did an amazing job making sure the rehearsal, ceremony, my husband and I, and other big picture items were taken care of. Thank you, Rebeccah for all of your hard work!  
Then it came to Allan. Allan was a godsend! He was our day of coordinator and let me tell you, he and Rebeccah are the perfect dynamic duo! All of the small things he did for us and our parents put this experience over the top. From the guidance he provided, to all the drinks and even bringing us out tea, his level of service was exceptional and everyone seemed to take note. He was so helpful and friendly throughout the reception. Any questions, any needs, anything we could possibly desire, he was right there for all of it. He made sure we stayed on track with the timeline without being bothersome or overbearing. Every time I needed something or had a question he was one step ahead of me. Being I’m also an event planner, it’s rather hard to stay ahead of me but Allan pulled it off flawlessly. Thank you, Allan!  
Overall I would absolutely recommend The White Room to any couple. Besides the stunning venues, exceptional customer service, the food was out of this world. It takes a lot for me and my family to be impressed by food (we’re definitely snobs) and we absolutely were. We chose to do stations and they did not disappoint. The Farmers Market Station and Seafood Station along with passed apps made for the perfect amount of food during cocktail hour. Everyone seemed to enjoy everything! For dinner, we continued the station theme and it was perfect for our group. Everyone’s food was served hot and the Prime Rib was cooked perfectly. There was not a single thing that I would change about the food. We received sooooo many compliments about the food. People would not stop talking about the cookie station! That's one thing that almost everyone said to us after the wedding was how amazing the cookies were. Guests loved them so much they were putting cookies in their pockets on the way out the door!  
If you are looking for a beautiful venue with overly friendly staff and amazing food this is the place you want to host your wedding. I cannot thank this team enough for all of their hard work. You can tell everyone here loves what they do and it shows in the setup and the quality of the food. Thank you White Room for making my wedding simply amazing!

Venue Couldn't Be More Perfect...

We got married at The White Room 1/23/22 on the rooftop (dinner in the loft) and WOW just what a wonderful day. Guests kept complimenting on how beautiful the venue was, how great the food tasted, and just how much of a great time they had. They made the planning process easy. The only thing I would recommend is to schedule a private tasting. They do a quarterly tasting, but honestly I do not think it encompases everything they have availble. Also make sure you know what you want going in so you aren't surprised by any upcharges ( but that is just a general tip for all venues). Thank you so much to the team at the white room for making our day a day we will never forget!

The White Room is a great location for weddings. The loft-style atmosphere is gorgeous and the view is unmatched! I love doing photography here because it is centrally located downtown and so convenient for pictures in the historic area. I also love the beautiful sunlight that comes shining through the windows!
