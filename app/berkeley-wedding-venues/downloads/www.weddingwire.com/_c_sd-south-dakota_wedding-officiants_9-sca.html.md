We can't say enough about how great Kelsey was, especially since things got a little crazy! When our officiant backed out super close to the wedding, we were worried everything would fall apart. But Kelsey was a total lifesaver. She was so flexible about stepping in last minute, and she totally got what we wanted for the ceremony. On top of that, she was just so fun and happy – it really lifted our spirits. She turned what could have been a total mess into a beautiful and heartfelt ceremony that felt perfect for us. We're so grateful for her chill vibes, her skills, and the good energy she brought to our wedding. 10/10 would recommend! Thank you again, Kelsey, for saving the day and making our wedding unforgettable!!

Veronika was amazing. She brought such a calming presence on our wedding day. She did a great job helping our family during the rehearsal figure out where they needed to go and when, and the ceremony itself was very smooth. We changed our rehearsal venue about a week ahead of time and she was very flexible with us to accommodate the change. She provided some example templates to help us build a ceremony script that would feel genuine to us and it allowed us to really tailor our ceremony. We would certainly recommend her services!

We booked Barry as a last-minute solution after our original officiant plan fell through. Barry was helpful, responsive, and gave plenty of tips and advice ahead of the Big Day. During the rehearsal and the ceremony he was kind, funny, and kept everything (and everyone) organized and moving. His knowledge and experience made our wedding stress-free and enjoyable.
