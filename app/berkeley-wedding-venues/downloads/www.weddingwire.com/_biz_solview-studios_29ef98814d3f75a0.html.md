**Sol View Studios** is a New England–based creative studio specializing in DJ artistry, photography, videography, and event production.

Founded in 2018, Sol View Studios grew out of a simple idea: events should feel intentional, seamless, and emotionally grounded—not chaotic or generic. With roots going back to first live performances in 2016, the studio has since delivered **250+ events** across weddings, corporate gatherings, private celebrations, and branded productions.

What sets Sol View Studios apart is process. Every event is approached with structure, preparation, and adaptability—balancing technical precision with real-time awareness of the room. Music is curated with purpose. Visuals are captured with narrative in mind. Logistics are planned so clients can stay present while everything runs smoothly behind the scenes.

Sol View Studios isn’t about trends or templates. It’s about creating environments where people feel comfortable, energized, and fully engaged—whether that’s on a packed dance floor, during a cinematic first look, or throughout a tightly timed corporate program.

From planning to execution, the focus is always the same: clarity, professionalism, and unforgettable results.

Thank you Ray!

From the very beginning, SolView Studios was professional, responsive, and easy to work with. Communication was clear throughout the planning process, and they took the time to understand our vision, preferences, and overall vibe for the night.  
  
On the wedding day, everything ran seamlessly. The setup was clean and polished, the sound quality was excellent, and the music selection was spot-on. They did an amazing job reading the room and keeping the energy exactly where it needed to be—from meaningful moments to full-on dance floor fun. Our guests were on the dance floor all night, and we received nonstop compliments about the music.  
  
If you’re looking for a DJ who is organized, skilled, and genuinely invested in making your wedding unforgettable, SolView Studios is an excellent choice. We would absolutely recommend them to other couples.
