I’m so glad we ultimately ended up going with love and letterpress. They were a lot more affordable than the other companies we were considering. Our invitations were such high quality and absolutely beautiful! There was great communication too. I was thoroughly impressed. Would definitely recommend.

It is hard to adequately describe the wonderful experience of working with Nicole for our wedding. Everything came together ideally to make each phase of our wedding stand out, from our initial Save the Dates to the signage on our wedding day. The planning process highlighted how gifted Nicole is at taking the seeds of our ideas and making them concrete. The initial planning meeting was easy and collaborative, and we came away with complete confidence that Nicole would execute what we were looking for with our wedding stationary. Nicole is a very talented graphic designer, especially if you're particular about the typeface or font choice like I was. Even if you have no idea how to differentiate a serif from a sans-serif font, I can promise that Nicole will easily guide you to the perfect font choice for your wedding style. This talent also extends to the layout of the wedding stationery and signage, which she does effortlessly. Our wedding aesthetic was inspired by Walt Disney World's 50th anniversary colors. Working with Nicole, she took our ideas one step further by providing a fantastic assortment of paper samples, which allowed us to choose beautifully shimmery paper stocks that have received so many compliments from our wedding guests. Nicole provided plentiful updates, including a mock-up update, so we could get a glimpse and verify everything before it all went to print. It was such a fun moment to get our reveals, which only made us anticipate the arrival of our wedding stationary more. We were ecstatic when we received our Save the Dates and our Wedding Invites to send to our guests. It went so far beyond what our mock-up revealed, and this is where I highly recommend hiring someone as talented as Nicole to handle your wedding stationery. There is no equivalent when using an online print vendor because it will never get the exact specificity you want. All your choices will be limited, and none of the website tools will match the years of expertise of a graphic designer. Every element of our wedding stationery and signage was perfectly executed. Nicole took what could have been suitable at best had we done it ourselves and truly helped make that part of our wedding magical.

Kathy’s work is absolutely amazing! Truly blown away by her artistic ability and expertise. Our invitation suites feel like a true work of art, and so do our menus, programs, and name place-cards. Kathy was so great to work with - incredibly responsive and has such a good eye for design. Her studio is so cute and it was so fun to go into the shop and see all the different types of paper, design ideas, etc and then create paper products that helped set the tone for our wedding! Could not be happier with how all of our wedding paper turned out. Would highly recommend!

Created a beautiful Certificate to commemorate our 25th Anniversary in the style of a Quaker wedding certificate. I could not be more pleased with both the service and the certificate and would highly recommend to friends and family!!!

I was looking for beautiful invites that stood out from all those that you see online through bigger companies like Minted and was lucky enough to stumble across Mospens. James was so patient and spent numerous emails back and forth helping me to get my customized designs just right. When I got them in the mail I couldn’t be happier, especially with the fact I opted to splurge for the inner envelopes which added the perfect touch. Would 100 percent recommend and will be even reaching out for them to help with my escort cards when my wedding day gets closer :)

I made my favors and several other accessories for my wedding, and what I had a lot of trouble finding was quality bulk ribbon at a decent price. I decided to take a chance on the Ribbon Factory because their prices for bulk satin & grosgrain ribbon were fantastic. I'm so glad I did, because they were super responsive (their emails aren't automated, they're sent by a real person!) to my question, and I received my ribbon very quickly. It was very high quality and just perfect for what I needed it for (tying up my favors!). I know that many brides are going to need ribbon, whether they are tying some favor bags or embellishing their DIY centerpieces. I've recommended this shop to 2 other brides who also were delighted at the service & the product.

I worked with Nicole from Invite Design selecting the Hibiscus metal invitation, I liked that it was unique and guest will be able to keep as an ornament. Working with Nicole was a breeze, when I was in a pinch and needed additional invitations she had them shipped immediately allowing me to mail out to my guests. We received a lot of compliments on our invitations, thank you Nicole for your contribution to our special day!

I am more than pleased with my decision to have Hollo's Papercraft do the invitations for my daughter's wedding along with the other paper products such as ceremony programs and menus. Irene and Autumn have been amazing through the entire process. They have been so helpful and responsive to our needs and such a pleasure to work with. The invitations turned out so perfect and exactly what we envisioned and I can't wait to go back this weekend and work on the programs and menus. You won't be disappointed.
