The beach wedding of our dreams was made a reality thanks to Teresa! The day was intimate and family focused (only 12 of us) but she completely understood our needs, style and values and helped us every step of the way. All our planning was able to be done digitally without ever having to meet Teresa or her vendors in person. Just before arriving we had a COVID scare thanks to Omicron, but Teresa was patient, confident and did an amazing job calming my nerves with positive vibes. The day we finally arrived on the Island we met with Teresa and the Photographer (Anita from Brilliant Studios, also awesome) for the first time to review what we had planned over cocktails and became fast friends. We were totally prepped for a smooth wedding day, and it went exactly as Teresa laid out. Thanks completely to her super strong on island connections, organization, out going personality & professionalism! I couldn't have asked for anything more from our wedding coordinator.

I’m a DIY girl and accustomed to creating what is in my head, “my vision”. This time I had to trust my vision to Keisha and I’m so glad I did! Keisha reached out to me after I realized I couldn’t set up my wedding and get ready to be married at the same time - duh! The unprompted empathy she showed versus a sales pitch was truly appreciated. A few days later, I reached out to Keisha to ask for her help. I sent photos of my vision. Incorporated in my vision were handmade decorations I brought with me to the island. Keisha literally worked magic. From the wedding arch, to the flowers, to the restaurant tables my vision became a reality - it was perfection. The one thing that could have been better was communication with me at the time the wedding should have started. I didn’t realize the pastor was late until I came downstairs from my suite. My fiancé knew but I didn’t get the message. Beyond that, Keisha was lovely to work with. She knows the island and the right vendors to use to make your dream come true and she didn’t seem to mind my DIY input for the wedding. I highly recommend Keisha at Destination Turks & Caicos

Mary Thompson was the best decision my husband and I could have made for our wedding. From the very first meeting, Mary was intentional, thoughtful, thorough, and put all of our worries at ease. She listened to our needs, wants, and concerns when planning a destination wedding. She was attentive and communicative throughout the whole planning process and gave us plenty of options, offering her opinion when needed. Her knowledge of Provo and the TCI community is top notch. When it comes to recommendations and decision making across the board, Mary tells it like it is--leaving the ultimate decision up to the couple, but providing clear, unbiased information needed to feel confident in the direction you decide to go. We valued this greatly from Mary. On the day of our wedding - we had crazy weather and a power outage and Mary (and Katy!) never missed a beat. They were on top of everything to the point where I couldn't worry because I knew that no matter what, we were in such incredible hands. We are so grateful for Mary + the team for everything and could not recommend them more.

From the moment we first spoke with Rosalind on the phone, 18 months before the wedding even took place, she made it very obvious that she knew exactly what we wanted and at our budget. Throughout the entire planning process, she listened to our needs, calmed our worries, and never missed a beat with any detail. Her vendor choices in Turks and Caicos all provided five-star service without breaking the bank. She was there for every event, making sure that everything was running perfectly. She had this magical way of always being there when you had a question or concern. We were a bit sad when we ended our last event on the island - it was like our nuptial guardian angel was going away. Thank you, Rosalind, for the gift of a the best time of our lives. If you want a Turks and Caicos wedding you'll never forget, planned with the utmost care and attention, Rosalind of Cinnamon Sun is your ONLY choice.
