Was very professional and accommodating. He made for a great minister that was able to adapt to some last minute complications. I would recommend to anyone looking to elope or host a large ceremony!

Deb did a great job performing our wedding ceremony. She worked around my husbands busy schedule to accommodate our first meeting. She explained her process and took the time to understand what we were wanting as well. She continued to communicate with us as our wedding date got closer to ensure we were all on the same page. I would 100% recommend her to anyone.

Tammy was so flexible and understanding with our non traditional ceremony. We did not give her much notice, and she was still able to accommodate our event. She helped through all the hiccups as well, which was so amazing. It is nice to have someone calm and creative. Thank you for being a part of our special day!

I gotta give it to him. He’s so friendly and we enjoyed meeting him and hearing all of his stories about his past and how he also does a lot for his community with donations for multiple organizations. He answered all of our questions as well and we have a good idea how we all will have things go before and during the wedding thanks to him! I can’t wait for our wedding day with this gentleman. Thanks again!

Robert was a fantastic officiant! He told our story in such a beautiful way, while keeping it both entertaining and professional. Many of our guests had positive things to say about him and thought we must have known him for a long time because his speech was so personalized. We were also able to review and edit the ceremony script a week in advance.

Pastor Michael officiated our May 2023 wedding and was absolutely wonderful to work with! He gave us so many options and suggestions for the ceremony so that it was exactly what we wanted! At the rehearsal dinner, he made sure everyone knew exactly what to do which made our ceremony on the day of the wedding go perfectly. I would absolutely recommend Pastor Michael!

Chase did a wonderful job officiating our surprise wedding in front of a small gathering of family and friends. He met with us in advance to ensure that all would go as planned, preserving the element of surprise for our guests. Chase also assisted us in crafting our wedding vows. His poise, well-spoken manner, and pleasant nature enhanced the ceremony and elevated the experience for everyone in attendance.

Tim was great from start to finish. I loved his quick response and friendliness. He made everything a breeze and was very cool about it all. We just did a quick elopement-style ceremony, but it was officiated extremely well with very thoughtful comments, and we appreciated the things he shared even though he didn’t know us. I would definitely recommend Tim to anyone. I can only imagine how great he’d also be in a large, traditional wedding. Very enthusiastic and personable and an excellent speaker. So happy to have come across his website!

Rev Shirley is very personable and got to know us before officiating our wedding. We had to make some changes to our wedding and she was very helpful in accommodating with meeting with us to review our changes. She took the time to get to know us as a couple and was supportive of our 'wedding stresses' that occurred. She felt like family to us as we said 'I do!'

We had the privilege of having Rev King as our officiant for our September wedding. He was wonderful and we received so many compliments on the ceremony. Every time we met with Rev King, he was so kind and excited about our wedding. The first time we met with him at a Panera, we stayed there for almost 3 hours just talking about random things and listening to stories of his life. He is so passionate and proud of what he does. It was a straightforward, clean ceremony which is exactly what we wanted. Thank you, Rev King!
