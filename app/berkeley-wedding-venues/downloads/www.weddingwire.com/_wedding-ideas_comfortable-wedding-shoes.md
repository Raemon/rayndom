It's important to find bridal shoes that you can stand (or dance) in for hours on end, without worrying about blisters or uncomfortable heels that hurt every time you walk. We searched the internet and read reviews to find this list of options that prove you don't have to sacrifice comfort for style.

Get ready to strut your stuff—and hit the dance floor—in these comfortable wedding shoes. 

## Comfortable Wedding Flats

Having a beach wedding? These rose gold beaded sandals are an easy, practical option for walking in the sand or going barefoot at a moment's notice.

**Jewel Badgley Mischka** Ohara flat evening sandals, $89, [Macy's](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/jewel-badgley-mischka-womens-ohara-flat-evening-sandals?ID=12129141)

[ __ ![](https://cdn1.weddingwire.com/assets/img/articles/banner/rectangle-210@2x.png) ![](https://cdn1.weddingwire.com/assets/img/articles/banner/rectangle-211@2x.png) ![](https://cdn1.weddingwire.com/assets/img/articles/banner/rectangle-213@2x.png) ![](https://cdn1.weddingwire.com/assets/img/articles/banner/rectangle-212@2x.png) Your style, our vendors Browse wedding photos to find vendors that match your style. __ ](https://www.weddingwire.com/p/browse-by-images/wedding-photos.html)

These timeless wedding flats will look sophisticated with nearly any type of wedding gown, from minimalist slip styles to dreamy tulle skirts. They come in more than 10 colors and prints, including gold, ballet pink, and this pretty blue color.

**Margaux** The Demi in Cerulean, $225, [Margaux](https://margauxny.com/collections/the-demi)

If classic shoes are your style, we like these sheer black flats that are easy to re-wear even after your wedding. The sparkly polka dots make them a bit more special than an everyday shoe.

**Jeffrey Campbell** Shine For You ballet flats, $158, [Free People](https://www.freepeople.com/shop/shine-for-you-ballet-flats/)

Bridal sneakers are a cute, comfortable option if you don't want to wear heels or ballet flats on the big day. This pearl-embellished style would be ideal for an outdoor wedding. 

**Dolce Vita** Zina pearl sneakers, $160, [Dolce Vita](https://www.dolcevita.com/products/zina-pearl-in-vanilla-pearls)

We'd wear these adorable pearl-embellished sandals for a summer elopement or nautical wedding. 

**Steve Madden** Knicky sandals, $80, [Steve Madden](https://www.stevemadden.com/products/knicky-ivory)

Pointed-toe flats are an elegant alternative to heels for a formal reception. Choose from rose gold, silver, or champagne.

**Jewel Badgley Mischka** Bambi slingback evening flats, $89, [Macy's](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/jewel-badgley-mischka-womens-bambi-slingback-evening-flats?ID=10478025)

These chic flats in a bridal white hue prove that comfortable wedding shoes can also be super cute. We like the black grosgrain ribbon trim, which adds contrast and a Parisienne vibe.

**Maeve** The Sabina ballet flats, $120, [Anthropologie](https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/the-sabina-ballet-flats)

## Comfortable Wedding Wedges

Channel vintage style by wearing lace peep-toe wedges with delicate ankle straps and glistening beads.

**Betsey Johnson** Ivan ivory satin embroidered ankle strap wedges, $139, [Lulus](https://www.lulus.com/products/sb-ivan-ivory-satin-embroidered-ankle-strap-wedges-sandals/2272956.html)

With an extra-cushioned footbed, these espadrille wedges are made to be worn all day long (and they're perfect for an outdoor wedding). Plus, you can wear them again and again after the big day.

**TOMS** Marisela wedge sandal, $80, [TOMS](https://www.toms.com/us/195703333408.html)

If you're going for a glamorous look, try these streamlined white wedges with crystal beading.

**Lady Couture** Kloe wedge sandal, $90, [DSW](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/lady-couture-kloe-wedge-sandal/560181)

These glam wedges are bedazzled with rhinestones for eye-catching sparkle every time you walk.

**Betsey Johnson** Denni wedges, $139, [Betsey Johnson](https://betseyjohnson.com/products/sb-denni-rhinestones)

Strappy shoes à la the early 2000s are making a comeback, and these satin sandals are a great example. The ivory is perfect for wedding day, but you can also grab them in gold or silver.

**Larroude** Yves wedge, $315, [Larroude](https://larroude.com/products/ivory-yves-wedge-leather)

## Comfortable Wedding Heels

We know these look intimidating, but here's a secret: platform shoes are actually  _way_ easier to walk in than you think. That's because the platform lifts your toes and the ball of your foot to be even with your heel—and the thick platform provides a larger surface area for you to balance. 

**Lulus** Acee suede platform heels, $42, [Lulus](https://www.lulus.com/products/acee-natural-suede-platform-heels/1058782.html)

We're serious when we say these might be the perfect pair of [blue wedding shoes](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/blue-wedding-shoes). Silver bow embellishments add just the right amount of sparkle to these pretty kitten heel pumps. 

**MACH & MACH** double bow 65mm crystal-embellished sandals, $777, [FARFETCH](https://www.farfetch.com/shopping/women/mach-mach-double-bow-65mm-crystal-embellished-sandals-item-21484163.aspx)

Yes, it's actually possible to find comfortable wedding heels! Look for thick block heel in a medium height (around 3 inches) and straps that will keep the shoes securely in place so you don't have to worry about re-adjusting.

**Steve Madden** Luxe heeled sandal, $90, [Zappos](https://www.zappos.com/p/steve-madden-luxe-heeled-sandal-natural/product/9899569/color/19)

Skip the stilettos for trendy slip-on mules instead. With a short block heel and ruched strap, these sandals are a perfect accessory for a modern bridal look. 

**Loeffler Randall** Bianca kitten heel mule, $295, [Loeffler Randall](https://loefflerrandall.com/products/bianca-cream-kitten-heel-mule)

Featuring a 2.5-inch block heel, padded insole, and strategically placed straps to avoid cuts, these comfortable wedding shoes are also extremely chic. A silver rhinestone buckle accents the ivory satin. 

**Margaux** The City Sandal in ivory satin, $345, [Margaux](https://margauxny.com/collections/the-city-sandal?color=Ivory+Satin)

These gray velvet shoes were made for partying. With a comfortable platform heel and footbed cushioning, your feet will be happy (and cute) all night long.

**Coconuts** Robin platform sandal, $90, [DSW](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/coconuts-robin-platform-sandal/567120)

With a heel height at 4 inches, these satin pumps are on the taller side, but their design with an ankle strap and thick heel keeps them in the running for comfortable bridal shoes.

**Lulus** Laura satin ankle strap heels, $39, [Lulus](https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-11575-88550-157915?sid=WWeditorial&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lulus.com%2Fproducts%2Flaura-champagne-satin-ankle-strap-heels%2F1606136.html)

The square open toe on these white heeled sandals gives them a trendy '90s-inspired vibe. 

**Sam Edelman** Daniella heel in Bright White, $120, [Zappos](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9069125/type/dlg/sid/WWeditorial/https://www.zappos.com/p/sam-edelman-daniella-bright-white-butter-nappa-leather/product/9257182/color/779788)

With a sensible heel height and cushioned footbed, these blue suede shoes are guaranteed to be comfortable. 

**Nine West** Flax pump in Sky Blue, $95, [Zappos](https://www.zappos.com/p/nine-west-flax-pump-sky-blue-suede/product/7798031/color/6510)

Go for a timeless look by wearing slingback pumps. This style features a walkable kitten heel and comes in ivory or light blue.

**Seychelles** Neve heels, $139, [Anthropologie](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=39789&u1=WWeditorial&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropologie.com%2Fshop%2Fbhldn-seychelles-neve-heels-3)

Chunky heels are a sensible choice for outdoor weddings, since they'll keep you from sinking into the grass. 

**ALOHAS** Bellini sandal, $180, [REVOLVE](https://www.revolve.com/alohas-bellini-sandal-in-gold/dp/ALOH-WZ14/)

With a heel just under 3 inches, these nude pumps give you height and style without killing your feet. 

**Marc Fisher LTD** Zala pump in lite Latte, $160, [Zappos](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9069125/type/dlg/sid/WWeditorial/https://www.zappos.com/p/marc-fisher-ltd-zala-pump/product/8735611)

## Comfortable Wedding Boots

These off-white booties are versatile enough to pair with a tulle ball gown, a figure-hugging sheath gown, or even a short wedding dress.

**Lulus** Dawson pointed-toe mid-calf boots in bone, $56, [Lulus](https://www.lulus.com/products/dawson-bone-pebble-pointed-toe-mid-calf-boots/903302.html)

Want to make a fashion statement? Rock these rhinestone ankle boots to instantly wow your wedding guests. They would also be a fun addition to a wedding after party outfit.

**Blue by Betsey Johnson** Cady dress bootie, $119, [Zappos](https://www.zappos.com/p/blue-by-betsey-johnson-cady-dress-bootie-rhinestone/product/9313359/color/30459)

Treat yourself to a pair of comfortable white cowboy boots if you're having[ a rustic-style wedding](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/rustic-wedding-style).

**Dingo 1969** Primrose leather booties, $140, [Anthropologie](https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/dingo-1969-primrose-leather-booties)

If you're relatively tolerant of heels, these 2.4-inch booties with an iridescent mother-of-pearl heel will give your wedding day outfit a boho chic edge.

**Freya Rose** June wedding boots, $903, [Freya Rose](https://freyarose.com/products/june-boots)

Say hello to the coolest pair of bridal boots we've ever seen. An eye-catching mesh pattern and rhinestones gives these comfortable wedding shoes a high-fashion spin.

**Pnina Tornai for Naturalizer** Liebe bootie, $325, [Zappos](https://www.zappos.com/p/naturalizer-pnina-tornai-for-naturalizer-liebe-silk-white/product/9918125/color/557788)

These lace-up boots would fit right in at an unexpected wedding venue, like [the middle of a desert](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-nail-desert-wedding-style) or a mountaintop elopement. 

**Frye** Sabrina 6G lace up boot, $448, [Frye](https://www.thefryecompany.com/products/sabrina-6g-lace-up)
