## Wedding Rentals

You and your beloved like to take the path less traveled – it’s no surprise you aren’t about to put on a cookie-cutter wedding. If you’ve chosen a unique venue that doesn’t include all the supplies you’ll need to host your ceremony and reception, then you’ll need to find a vendor that offers wedding rentals. After all, your guests still need places to sit and eat. Fortunately, vendors specializing in wedding rentals can hook you up with great furnishings and decorations so you can create a wedding that is uniquely you.

## When to Use a Vendor for Wedding Rentals

Most traditional wedding venues like [hotels](https://www.weddingwire.com/hotel-weddings), [banquet halls](https://www.weddingwire.com/banquet-hall-weddings), [country clubs](https://www.weddingwire.com/country-club-weddings) and others offer wedding packages that include everything you need for your ceremony and reception. However, if you are eyeing a non-traditional venue, you may have to find your own furnishings.

For example, if you dream of having a [beach wedding](https://www.weddingwire.com/beach-weddings), [park wedding](https://www.weddingwire.com/park-weddings) or [garden wedding](https://www.weddingwire.com/garden-weddings) in a public space, you will likely need to bring your own supplies. The same goes if you want to transform your parents’ backyard or your uncle’s barn into the site of a fairytale wedding.

As long as you don’t mind rolling up your sleeves and doing a little extra work, bringing in your own supplies is completely doable. In fact, this way you’ll get more say over the look and feel of your wedding. (Here are some [great wedding décor ideas](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/decor--t31) to help inspire you.)

## What a Wedding Rental Vendor Can Offer

As the coordinator at your venue what supplies they offer. If you’re looking at a non-traditional venue, the answer may be not much. Not to worry – a wedding rental supplier allows you to rent all the furnishings and other important touches you need to pull off your wedding. Most wedding supply rentals include:

  * Chairs for the ceremony
  * Chair covers
  * Tables and chairs for the reception
  * Dishware and silverware for the reception
  * Tablecloths and napkins for the reception



Some companies also offer additional decorations and/or wedding services, including wedding tents. You might be able to find a [florist](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-florists) or [photographer](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photographers) with your wedding rental company.

## How to Prepare for a Meeting With a Wedding Rental Company

Before you meet with a company that specializes in wedding supply rentals, get the important details of your event sorted. Bring a ballpark [guest list](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/wedding-guests-list.html) so the rental company knows how many tables, chairs and place settings you’ll need. It also helps if you know your [wedding colors](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-colors-pantone) and have a [wedding theme](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/classic-wedding-style) in mind so you can choose rentals that match your vision. Finally, keep your [wedding budget](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/wedding-budget.html) handy. It’s easy to overspend on supplies if you don’t keep an eye on the price tag.

If you’re wondering, “Where can I find wedding rentals near me?” then we’ve got you covered at WeddingWire. Search your area, and we’ll show you the best wedding rental vendors near you.
