We catered from Chef David's for our wedding at the DeKoven Center back in July 30, 2022. We had over 220 guests, and Chef David's catered and served a delicious plated meal which consisted of chicken, steak, potatoes and vegetables. I heard stories of how couples barely ate on their wedding day, but I made sure we were able to sit and eat every bite. From the moment we came into their business for the tasting, we felt like family. David and his wife Kathy are so kind, we immediately felt like we were in the presence of family. The food was excellent, the servers were efficient and kind and our guests are still raving about the food from our wedding! Absolutely mouth-watering. They were very reasonable with their pricing and managed the set up and clean up very efficiently. I would recommend them to anyone who wants to have a delicious and memorable wedding dinner!

Hawg Tyed catered my daughter's wedding this past weekend. The food was AMAZING! They were so easy to work with and cooked the food onsite so we could smell the goodness all day! I can't tell you how many compliments we received on the fabulous food! It was all perfect!

We couldn't be more grateful for the amazing experience and service we received from Red Lion and, in particular, Sandy! From start to finish, the communication was great, and Sandy went above and beyond to ensure everything was perfect and stress free for our big day. She worked within our budget to get us the best deals without sacrificing quality. Her hospitality was incredible! The food was amazing- our guests are still raving about it! I honestly wish I could give more than 5 stars because the experience was just that exceptional. I highly, highly recommend Red Lion!

The staff was so awesome and so polite, helpful, and very informed! They knew exactly where anyone with allergies was sitting and made sure they got their food or went first in buffet for cross contamination! So thoughtful and smart! Every guest said how much they enjoyed their food and how pleasant the staff was! From the main dinner to our late night meal everything was so great! Couldn’t recommend them more! Here is a picture of my cousin who clearly loved her food so much she took a picture with her empty plate :) thank you AOC for the great service and a memorable and easy night for my husband and me!

Upstairs Downstairs catered our rehearsal dinner & welcome drinks a couple weeks ago. We can not speak more highly of their services - the food was tasty and service was excellent. Working with Upstairs leading up to the event could not have been easier - they are very accommodating and made for an epic night!

Blue Plate is the way to go! They were helpful, responsive, professional and most importantly, the food was delicious! We went with the taco bar and everyone was happy! My biggest fear was the food being lukewarm, but Gary assured me it'd be hot and he was right! I highly recommend having them cater your wedding...a great experience from start to finish!

Saz's helped us to decide a family styled meal plan. They also accommodated a specialized vegetarians, children's meal and dietary restrictions menu planning. Saz's Catering went above and beyond the call of duty. I would recommend this company to family and friends. Saz's Catering Not 5 starts but 10 ⭐.

Celebrations on Wells was wonderful to work with! They were organized, flexible, and professional. We were able to hire them for food, drink, linens, and day of coordinator. They even made sure to leave a plate of appetizers at the head table for the bride and groom to have after they were done taking photos. We highly recommend this company!

Married 1 month ago. - I dealt with mark through email for the planning process and I couldn't speak more highly about his professionalism, effectiveness and honestly and truly just a pleasant person to speak with & do business with. I loved how he went through various options for me and he always kept my budget as a top priority when planning with me. We did a sit down taste testing and he was there and again it was pleasant along with the food tasting! I got more compliments than i can remember on how delicious their mashed potatoes were! they were also mine and my husbands favorite as well. The flow of the dinner service with servers and the crew went so well and effective! Honestly- I love how they are budget friendly and delivered top tier over exceeding service & quality of food. Thank you Mark & Irenes Catering Staff !
