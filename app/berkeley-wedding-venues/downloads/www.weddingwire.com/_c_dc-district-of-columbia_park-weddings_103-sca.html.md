We couldn’t have imagined a more perfect wedding venue than The Woodlands at Algonkian! The setting is absolutely beautiful, it is so woodsy and serene, with gorgeous views that made our day feel magical. The bridal suite was comfortable and perfect for getting ready. The venue coordinators were incredibly helpful, professional, and made the entire process seamless from start to finish. They took care of all the details so we could relax and enjoy our day. We also have to give a huge shoutout to their catering team, Blue Heron Catering. The food was amazing, beautifully presented, and received so many compliments from our guests. The servers and bartenders were also great. Everything ran smoothly and exceeded our expectations. We couldn’t recommend The Woodlands at Algonkian more! It was the best place to celebrate our wedding, the best day ever!

We had an excellent experience with Cedar Knoll for our wedding reception. The venue was lovely, the bar staff was great, and we and our guests had a wonderful time. Our space was beautiful and the perfect size for our group. The restaurant staff was superb. The entrees were spectacular and well-received. The cake was beautiful and delicious, as well. Our flowers and cake topper were added perfectly. The passed hors d’oeuvres of asparagus en croute and mini-burgers were a highlight. There was plenty of room for dancing and the views were magnificent. Thank you, Cedar Knoll, for a beautiful and fun reception we will always remember!

We are so glad we chose The River View at Occoquan for our wedding. From the start, Hannah and Elizabeth were wonderful to work with. They were kind, flexible, and really took the time to make sure we felt comfortable with every detail. During our final walk-through, Elizabeth’s calm and reassuring approach helped ease any last-minute nerves. On the wedding day, the entire River View staff was outstanding. They were professional, attentive, and made sure everything ran smoothly so we could enjoy the day without stress. The venue itself is beautiful, spacious, and set in a gorgeous location by the water. We also worked with Great Blue Heron Catering and could not have been happier. Liz, the catering manager, helped us accommodate several dietary restrictions with ease, and the food was delicious. The chef even came out to greet us and personally brought our meals, which was such a thoughtful touch. Brooke, the banquet manager, worked seamlessly with our wedding planning team to keep everything on track. We would recommend The River View at Occoquan to any couple looking for a stunning venue with an incredible team.

We had an amazing wedding day at Glen Echo Park! Guests and vendors alike raved about the experience, and we couldn't be happier with the service provided by the GEP team (especially Mikea, who worked with us from day one to set up and execute a perfect day, and LaShea, who was there on our wedding day assisting with everything we needed and keeping spirits high!) The scenery at Glen Echo is amazing - you hardly need to decorate to have a fabulous and beautiful day. We held our ceremony in the Cuddle Up pavilion, which was so fun and unique, and our reception in the Bumper Car Pavilion. The Bumper Car Pavilion had heaters in place, so even on a chilly March evening, it ended up being perfect and comfortable. Our photographer was spoiled for choice when it came to locations, and our guests enjoyed meandering the park taking photos as well.

Wedding planning can be overwhelming, but choosing this venue was one of the easiest—and best—decisions we made! From the start, we were looking for a beautiful space that didn’t require a lot of extra decorating, and this venue delivered in every way. It’s absolutely stunning and worked perfectly for both our ceremony and reception. The owners are truly wonderful. They only host one wedding per week, which means they’re fully focused on you and your big day. You can really tell how much care and thought they’ve put into the space, right down to the little details that make everything feel special and seamless. One of the most unique things about this venue is that it’s located in a bird sanctuary. While the celebration does need to wrap up by 9 PM due to the location, we simply planned an after-party elsewhere and it worked out great! A fun twist: there’s no Wi-Fi on site. At first, we weren’t sure how that would go, but it actually turned out to be a huge plus. Our guests were fully present and engaged, which made the day feel even more meaningful. Some vendors who rely on digital payments had a bit of a hiccup, but we gave everyone a heads-up to bring cash, and I settled up with vendors the next day without any issues. All in all, this venue was a dream. I’d recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful, thoughtful, and truly special place to celebrate their wedding.

We had a fantastic experience at Shawnee Farms and with Katherine especially. Our family stayed for 4 nights, we had the ceremony in Luray caverns and reception in the barn of the Shawnee Farms Estate. The rooms were beautiful and beds comfortable. Kitchen was really awesome for hosting a lot of people and preparing some wedding snacks, also the master bedroom upstairs is a lovely place to prepare for your big day and have some photos taken. Katherine was so helpful and communicative. She went above and beyond to help us make our day the perfect day it was.

I loved having my wedding here - It is a beautiful but laid back venue with a natural backdrop of all of the plants in the garden center, which made decorating much easier. I couldn't have asked for a better place to get married.

The venue was perfect for a small gathering with our 20 guest. It can hold a max of 70 people comfortably. It was so beautiful in the fall for our rustic wedding!

Wollam Gardens was the perfect wedding venue! We wanted a relaxing outdoor wedding, and this place was absolutely perfect! Everyone was friendly and easy to work with, and the flowers were amazing! Even with uncooperative weather, we were able to have a perfect day in their gorgeous pavilion! We've had many guests compliment on how beautiful and unique the farm was. We highly recommend having your wedding here!
