Christmas Wedding at TBGC

TBGC was such a beautiful venue for my christmas themed wedding. My ceremony/reception was held in the clubhouse so we had the nice white, big fireplace as a background and was functional since it was chilly the whole night. The staff was very welcoming and accommodating. I worked with Hillary as my wedding coordinator and she just always went above and beyond for me and would always cater to my needs. I loved working with her! I highly recommend this place!!! 

The Bridges Golf Club's reply: 

Cherish you and Rowell were an absolute dream to work with! I wish you the best life together and really enjoyed working with you both and your sweet family. xoxo - Hillary

A Dreamy Wedding Venue

My husband and I held our wedding reception at the Bridges Golf Club, the Garden Pavilion room, and we were so delighted at how beautiful everything turned out! We worked with Sharon, who was highly responsive, flexible, and answered our many questions. Sharon was honest and provided great recommendations for the food, table layout, timeline, etc. Her feedback and wonderful communication skills made the wedding planning process so smooth.   
  
The wedding day was a breeze. The staff at the Bridges were on top of things and were on schedule. The table settings were beautiful, the staff were kind and professional, and the setting was stunning. Our guests were blown away by the spectacular views of the canyon, and took epic sunset photos. The staff always checked in on my husband and I to ensure we had sufficient food and drinks. Speaking of food, the food was so delicious! With Sharon's recommendation, we selected the prime rib, salmon, and ravioli. The portions were generous, and the guests were very impressed by the quality! We also had an open bar, and everyone enjoyed the quality of the drinks.  
  
We would recommend the Bridges without hesitation! Thanks Bridges for making our wedding day so magical.

Top tier wedding venue & staff!

My husband & I had the time of our lives at our wedding, which had a lot to do with the professionalism of the staff at The Bridges and how lovely the site was. Numerous guests talked about how beautiful the ceremony site and overall venue was and took a bunch of solo photos because of it. The staff, especially Sharon, was fantastic to work with - Sharon particularly was always responsive and helpful to address any questions or concerns we had.   
  
Another major highlight was the quality and quantity of the dinner food. We did family style and had enough food served for every guest to be full and still have some leftovers. The prime rib was particularly tasty as if it was made at a top steakhouse.   
  
We would gladly recommend The Bridges to anyone considering a Bay Area wedding.

Beautiful Venue for a Wedding

I photographed a wedding here in march 2022, and the venue is beautiful. Great location for gorgeous photos. The sun sets behind the altar and the view is just incredible. What a beautiful scenery to have for your wedding

Amazing venue!

Bridges was the perfect spot for us to have our wedding reception (we did the ceremony in a church where we went to college). Sandy was super responsive and helpful throughout the process. We also hired several vendors from Bridges’ preferred vendor listing or from their other close partnerships who made everything very seamless (Fantasy Sound Events, Cake Delight, Hazy Lane Studios, The Flower House, and Napa Valley Linens). We loved that their food menu had lots of great options and was able to be customized! Overall, we are so happy we did our reception at Bridges. We love that we can always come back to Bridges for golf or lunch at the restaurant to reminisce on our special day. Thank you to the Bridges team!

The Bridges = The Best!

The Bridges Golf Course was our perfect wedding location. The catering and events team (especially Sandy and Emma) were so fantastic in every way. Our food was amazing, the service was attentive, and Bridges staff worked seamlessly with our other vendors. Not to mention a picture-perfect yet convenient location. We couldn't have asked for more! Thank you again for making our wedding day so special :)

The Perfect Venue!

We couldn't have asked for anything more with Bridges! We had one of our wedding events here and it was PERFECT! The staff was very accommodating, helpful, and friendly. They were patient with us through all the pandemic uncertainties and were always available to either hop on a call or meet in person to discuss anything.   
  
The space itself was gorgeous! Not only did we have incredible views of the golf course for photos, but the ball room inside was also stunning with beautiful chandeliers and wood accents. The Bridges team made everything so easy for us and I would 10/10 recommend this venue to our family and friends! Thank you for making our wedding weekend so special and stress free!!

Great Wedding Venue!

Funny enough when I was in high school our junior prom was held at The Bridges Golf Club (TBGC) and now I can't believe our wedding reception was held here! Sandy and TBGC team were a dream to work with! They were always very responsive to all inquiries and the millions of questions I had during the wedding planning process. In the moment it may feel stressful meeting their somewhat strict deadlines but those deadlines are there for a purpose! Having those little details figured out earlier in the game definitely made the whole wedding process smoother. Our guests raved about the beautiful venue and thoroughly enjoyed the food as well! The staff on the day of were very attentive to my husband and I and made sure we were comfortable with enough food, drinks, etc. Their event captain also helped us get the best pictures with our wedding party prior to the event starting. All in all a great experience and I am so happy we went with The Bridges for our reception venue!

The best!

The Bridges is the perfect place to get married. It's beautiful and they take care of just about everything. We had our wedding on 10/03/2021 and it was perfect. Our guests raved about the beautiful venue, food and the great service!!!  
  
Sandy is the main coordinator and who I communicated with most of the time. She is AMAZING!! Planning a wedding during the pandemic was a bit of a challenge but Sandy always answered all of my questions promptly. She is very professional and you can tell she has been doing this for a long time. I have never planned a big event so it was great having Sandy to help us.   
  
Our day of coordinator was Mercedes who was also great !!! She helped with the rehearsal and throughout our wedding day. We were able to enjoy our wedding day as she and the rest of the staff took care of everything.   
  
I would highly recommend The Bridges for your next event !

Great place to get married!

The Bridges Golf Club was an amazing place to get married. From the onset they were very easy to work with, extremely responsive (often I got replies within minutes of my emails), and the wedding ended up being a dream. Everything leading up to the wedding was really well-planned and Celena was in constant communication to make sure that we had everything taken care of leading up to our big day. We enjoyed the food tasting, and working out all of our details. We were very at ease knowing The Bridges had everything taken care of.  
  
On the day of our wedding, everything was great. Everything was set up to do a flip of the fireplace room since we had the ceremony and reception in the same room. Also, they left a plate of hors d’oeuvres and glasses of champagne in the bridal room for us to enjoy immediately after the ceremony before taking photos. They even put our gifts in a safe place during the reception and had all of our toasting flutes, cake knives, and personal things packed up and ready to go for us at the end of the night. It made the whole night effortless for us.  
  
We are so happy we had our wedding at The Bridges, and the day after wished we could have done it all over again the exact same as the day before since we had so much fun!

Spectacular

The Bridges staff were phenomenal. All of my guests raved about how delicious the food was and how gorgeous the venue is. They made sure every moment was spectacular. The quality we received for the price is outstanding. I can not thank the staff enough for such an amazing day! They were on top of their game and were very accommodating to all of our requests.

The Bridges has it all!

The Bridges had everything we wanted in a venue, and more! From the moment we drove through the tree lined path and pulled up to the stunning Spanish style venue, we knew it was something special. We wanted a venue that was beautiful enough on its own to not need many decorations, and every space we used checked that box.   
  
Besides the beauty, the benefits of having a wedding at a golf course are many - with knowledgable and professional catering and staff all on-site. Everyone we worked with made the planning process easy as well as the day of the event. We always knew we were in good hands!

Dream wedding 

The Bridges was the best venue for my wedding! The staff were super professional, knowledgeable, organized, efficient, and all around helpful throughout the wedding planning process and the day of the wedding. I could not be happier with how well everything panned out and would definitely recommend them to everyone!

The perfect venue! You must checkout this place! 

  
Working with Bridges was painless, they handled everything! They were so organized and would reach out with any information/documents they needed filled out for the big day. For the rehearsal ceremony and day of, I was provided a coordinator. She ran everything for me! I didn't have to worry about food, set up, room lighting, timelines etc. I also found the pricing to be very competitive, and you are getting so much more for your money compared to other venues. It was nice having my tables, linens, chairs, coordinator etc. all come from Bridges so I didn't have to hire other vendors and saved money! I highly recommend the Bridges Golf Club to all my friends and family to host any type of event!

Helpful Staff

I am so happy I booked this venue. The entire staff was super helpful since the very beginning. Celena & Sandy were amazing to work with and they responded right away with whatever questions we had. On the day of the rehearsal I was introduced to Colby who would be our coordinator for the day and she was absolutely amazing. Our photographer failed to show up on time and my husband said Colby was calling all the photographer she knew since we were not sure if she would be showing up at all for our event. When our photographer did arrive, she took us away from our cocktail hour which is something we were supposed to have enjoyed had she been there on time, and Colby was nice enough to give us 15 extra minutes so that my husband and I could say our hello's and enjoy it with our family and friends. Silvia was also great making sure we were good with our food and were constantly refilled with our wine. Everyone was amazing and all I heard all night was how we had the best wedding ever and it had to do with entire staff at Bridges for making the wedding look flawless!

We had our wedding at The Bridges Golf Club this August 2018. Both my husband and I were so happy with how the day went and how much our guests enjoyed our wedding and the venue. The venue is really beautiful!   
  
We had over 200 guests and Bridges was able to accommodate our wedding size and have everything run smoothly. We had less than 6 months to plan everything, but with Sandy and Celena’s help and recommendations, we were able to complete all the details easily.   
  
Many of our guests expressed how great the food was at the reception (prime rib and chicken), including the appetizers and wine that was served. The day of coordinator, Colby, was so great! She made sure we stayed on schedule and she worked well with our photographer and DJ.   
  
I am so happy we chose The Bridges Golf Club for our big day! All our guests had a great time and that was really important to us. It was truly beautiful, fun and stress free!

My husband and I got married at The Bridges Golf Club in July 2018. When we were inquiring back in September 2017, they only had two more Saturdays in the summer months still open! We luckily were able to snag one of the last ones, and we could very clearly tell why this is such a popular place. What really sold me on this venue is the reception area. Absolutely beautiful space! I really loved that there were many different spaces, like the infamous tunnel, where the photographer could get some cool shots. Sandy and Celena were very responsive during the whole process, responding to my (many) emails promptly and were very detail-oriented. They were so helpful with the planning process and made it very stress free. The day-of-coordinator, Colby, was amazing as well! She made sure that we stayed on schedule- and worked so nicely with my vendors. The event staff was all very friendly as well, with Jaime making sure that my husband and I were always well taken care of. Thank you Bridges staff for making my wedding my dream wedding!

My wife and I got married at The Bridges Golf Club in November 2017 and the wedding was perfect as it went beyond what we could have imagined it to be. It was definitely one of the best day of our lives. We were lucky that the original couple who placed a tentative hold for the same day as us decided to not go with the booking. First of all, we would like to thank Sandy and Celena, our main venue contacts at Bridges. They were very helpful with everything from the initial tour of the venue to the thousands of questions we had during our planning phase to the last minute changes during the week of our wedding. As someone who values prompt responses, both of them were very very good about it. They were one of the reasons that made our big day so amazing and unforgettable. We were very grateful that they were on our side throughout the entire planning process. Secondly, the venue provides an event captain who is acts as the main organizer of the venue for the day-of tasks from setting up to serving meals to cleaning up. Before our wedding, we had witnessed a few bad experiences with our friends' venue's day-of coordinators, which led us to hire our own day-of coordinator. However, Colby was unbelievable as she was very detailed oriented and was on top of everything to help make sure our night went smoothly with the help of our day-of coordinators. The Bridges Golf Club has a great staff and provides exceptional customer service. In addition to the service, the venue is beautiful with awesome views. Fortunately, the weather on the day of our wedding worked out very well so we were able to have our ceremony at the Garden Terrace (outdoor site). We opted with the food and drinks from Bridges and it did not disappoint. We totally recommend this venue to any couple looking for a wedding venue as it will more than likely exceed their expectations.

The Bridges Golf Club is truly a beautiful and magical venue for anyone, they offer a gorgeous outdoor ceremony area that's surrounded by rich white roses, it over looks their meticulously maintained greens and is honestly a peaceful and majestic place in general, especially so at dusk.  
  
They have two options for you to host your wedding reception in, my wife fell in love with the first option right away, we actually reserved the cozy fireplace room for our wedding day 11/6/2016. The Fireplace Room is typically used to host weddings and or smaller events of around a 100 guests or less, unfortunately after adding an additional two tables to our seating chart it wasn't an option since we would've been crammed so we had no choice but to go with Option two, which was my favorite anyway hehe and boy were we glad that everything happened the way it did because we were blown away! Even though we had some reservations regarding the size of our party, Sandy assured us it would be fine so we trusted her judgement/expertise and ended up spacing the tables out, added a white couch, some tall boy tables to fill in empty spaces which worked perfectly because it provided extra places for our guests to mingle during the reception. The Grand Pavilion is a large hall with tall windows which allow lots of natural light during the day and at dusk, its over looking the vibrant greens and let me be the first to tell you how stunning this place looks decorated and after adding some up-lighting, we couldn't have dreamt of a more picture perfect wedding!  
  
The entire staff at The Bridges is on top of their game and are highly professional, and oh is their food sooo good!! We loved everything and everyone, so much so that we celebrated our first anniversary at The Bridges. We cannot thank them enough for setting the bar so high and always going above and beyond, Cannot recommend them enough and it doesn't matter who you work with because they're all so pleasant to work with! Cheers

Best.Decision.Ever.   
  
To start, the venue is absolutely gorgeous and it definitely has that "wow" factor. You will experience it as you drive toward the golf course along Bollinger Canyon Rd.   
  
Sandy and Celena were awesome to work with. They were quick with answering all of our questions (we had a lot of questions). Colby, the day of coordinator, did a fantastic job on the day of the rehearsal and also on the day of the wedding.  
  
There were also tons of locations for photos and videos (so many Instagram and SnapChat opportunities =) )   
  
As for the food & drinks...our guests absolutely loved everything! Service was quick. Trays of h'orderves started rolling out as soon as the ceremony ended. Entrees were also brought out on a timely manner.   
  
Our guests and us had a great time at The Bridges. Thank you for everything!

We got married at Bridges in August of 2017 and worked closely with Sandy and Celena to make it happen. From start to finish, they were both kind, positive and so patient with my family and me. They were both very responsive whenever I had questions or concerns and were always willing to work with me. Before we picked Bridges, I met with many other Bay Area venues but no venue came close to Bridges with regards to value for our money - you get SO MUCH when you choose Bridges (here's just a few):  
1\. The venue is beautiful - diverse indoor and outdoor areas for photos, guest mingling and amazing views during the ceremony and reception. We had our ceremony outdoors, overlooking the canyon and our reception in the elegant Garden Pavilion.   
2\. The staff is so friendly and helpful. Colby was our day-of-coordinator and she was great: easy to work with, strong knowledge of the venue, organized and kept us on track. Having a great team at the venue ended up being one of the most important pieces to planning our wedding and we are so, so grateful for this!!   
3\. The food was AMAZING - our guests continue to comment on how much they enjoyed the food. Dinner was just as delicious as our food tasting meeting and although we didn't try the appetizers beforehand, they were also a huge hit at our wedding.  
  
I highly recommend this place to anyone who looking for a Bay Area wedding venue- trust me, Bridges will take care of you and you won't regret it!

My husband (believe it or not) fell in love with the Bridges the very first time we visited. It was probably as close as love at first sight as you can get. It's beautiful. Sandy and her team are responsive, professional, and dependable throughout the whole process. The venue is beautiful and can hold large weddings, which is what we were looking for. We actually visited 14 venues and nothing compared to the Bridges, especially the value. If we could get married again, we would pick them again. Definitely do yourself a favor and visit the venue.

One of the best decisions I've ever made was selecting The Bridges as my wedding venue. I got married at the Bridges on 7/21/17, and it was without a doubt the most perfect day I could have ever imagined. From the moment I toured the Bridges (the grass terrace where the ceremonies take place, and the garden pavilion where the reception takes place) I completely fell in love. I had researched about 30 venues online, saw about 6 in person, and once I saw The Bridges, I knew it was the one. It was everything I wanted in a venue - a pretty view for the ceremony, and an open space for the reception.  
  
From the first interaction I had with Sandy and her team, I was blown away by their kindness, understanding, and responsiveness. Being in the event industry myself, I know how hard it is to keep up with all of the big and little details, e-mails, dates, etc. The way that Sandy and Celena worked made it seem like my wedding was the only big event they had to work on. Being a bride, there's nothing more you can ask for.   
  
Colby was an AWESOME day-of planner, and we will never forget our tasting with sweet Sylvia. The food was amazing (all of the guests LOVED their meals). I used Peters Photography, Denon & Doyle, and Pleasanton Rentals which are all preferred vendors - they were all great to work with as well! Sweet Events Bay Area did our dessert table/candy bar, and Traveling Tiger was our videographer - they were both amazing as well! I really do not have one thing to complain about. All brides should definitely look into having their wedding here.

The Bridges Golf Club was a beautiful and magical place to get married. Sandy and Celena were very wonderful to work with and virtually made our planning process stress-free. Everyone was very professional, quick to respond when we had questions, guided us with what needed to be done, and they had outstanding customer service. The views were gorgeous and the weather was beautiful - just perfect for our day. I definitely recommend this venue if you are looking for a place to get married!! =)

Outstanding amazing wedding venue!! We're so happy we went with The Bridges. Everything was perfect! We loved the venue the first day we took a look and talked to the staff. We planned for one year out and the dates were already competitive!  
  
We had our ceremony on the outdoor lawn, cocktail hour in the clubhouse and balcony space, and reception inside the large banquet hall (we did a venue buy-out). With 190 guests, it was worth it to rent the entire place! This gave us lots of space and freedom to move around and enjoy the venue. Initially we had almost chose another venue due to a better date, but so glad we didn't and stayed with The Bridges because they were the most perfect choice!  
  
The food was so good! During the food tasting, we made some notes and suggestions to alter the dishes to our liking such as less salt or more or less flavor here and there, and on the day of, they really took note of our preferences because the food came out exactly how we wanted, AND still warm from the kitchen. That's impressive.   
  
The staff is truly amazing and sincere. They go out of their way to make things happen and pay close attention to every detail. Even when you're out of ideas, they are quick to suggest something for you or mention best practices.

Bridges was an incredible venue to host our wedding. We were looking for a place that had indoor and outdoor ceremony options because we got married in January. Even in California, that's risky! We LOVED their ceremony room, and the fact that we could rent out the whole venue so that our party would be the only one there. They were incredibly helpful, especially given that we were planning our wedding from New York. Would highly recommend them - the views were gorgeous, the staff was professional and we got a TON of compliments from our guests!

Our wedding day was amazing and we can gladly say that The Bridges Golf Club played a huge role in that! This was the first and only venue we visited in person when deciding where to have our big day. During our first visit, we loved the cozy atmosphere and the spacious buildings as well as the outdoor pathways that complimented the golf course. The lights hanging on the trees were an added plus - especially for our winter wedding. We had our ceremony in the Clubhouse/Fireside Room and our reception in the Garden Pavilion. Both are beautiful buildings and were also decorated with Christmas decor!  
  
During the months leading up to our big day, we communicated frequently with Sandy and Celena who were extremely helpful and answered our numerous questions in detail in a very timely manner. We are very grateful for the clear communication! We also appreciated Colby, our day-of event captain, who made sure we knew what to do during the rehearsal, made sure the ceremony went smoothly, and ensured that our reception area was ready to go.   
  
Also, the food was delicious! We had prime rib, chicken florentine, and spinach cheese ravioli. The majority of our guests got prime rib and many told us after the wedding that they enjoyed every bit of their dinner! We loved our prime rib with mashed potatoes and we can actually say we ate a lot of food on our wedding day! We also had a baked potato bar which was one of the "must-haves" on our list. We highly recommend The Bridges Golf Club!

Wow, wow, wow! That is all I have to say! My husband and I got married at The Bridges Golf Club this past weekend on the day after Thanksgiving. The wedding was nothing short of magical! After searching and touring over 20 different venues, we decided to go with the Bridges because they had all the elements that were were looking for. Their prices were reasonable, the space was beautiful, and it was very convenient for our guests.   
  
We booked them over a year and a half in advance. They are quite the popular wedding venue. We had our wedding on a Friday because they threw in a lot of extra perks for Friday or Sunday weddings. Not only were the meals discounted, but they also threw in gold chargers and chivari chairs. Most other venues were charging extra fees to rent those items (~$7 per chair). We decided to do the venue buyout, which meant that we did our ceremony outside on the Garden Terrace, our cocktail hour in the Clubhouse, and the reception in the Garden Pavilion.   
  
Sandy and her team were extremely helpful throughout the entire planning process. I must have emailed Sandy once a day in the month leading up to the wedding. She usually responded the next day and answered all of my questions. On the day of the wedding, their banquet manager Silvia was there to ensure everything went smoothly. She was in constant communication with our day of coordinator and she helped orchestrate all the behind the scenes tasks. Our wedding week said it was going to rain on our wedding day and Silvia eased my fears by saying that they can always make a switch to the inside Fireside room if it did start to rain that day. Fortunately, the weather ended up being perfect and we were able to have our outside ceremony. At the end of the night, my husband and I gave her a big hug as she wished us congratulations. Overall, I would highly recommend The Bridges Golf Club to anyone because they really can make your dream wedding come true!

From the moment we toured The Bridges, we instantly knew this was our wedding venue. It was the only one we looked at in person but the views were amazing, the staff (especially Sandy) was amazing and the prices were VERY reasonable for the Bay Area especially when you look at everything that is included. I probably emailed Sandy a million times with questions concerns etc and she ALWAYS answered immediately. I never felt pressured to upgrade to anything and I always felt confident that all my ideas and planning were going to be executed to the T. At the rehearsal I met my Day of Event Captain (which comes with your package for FREE), Colby, and she was amazing. She helped with things beyond her scope and dealt with all the family drama etc. I couldn't have asked for a better venue and all our guests were amazed with the views, the rooms, the food, etc. The only recommendation I have for brides/grooms looking or even considering this place, BOOK ASAP. We went in December 2014 and they were completely sold out for all Saturdays in 2015 except Halloween and Christmas time so we had a 22 month engagement. **a side note** Jerry Rice is a member at this club and is often there on Saturdays and will take pictures with the bride and groom! Made our day even more magical!!!!

My husband and I recently got married at the Bridges and we are so happy we did! Everything was fabulous and the staff is incredibly easy to work with. The venue is also beautiful and can accommodate a large party. Whenever I emailed Sandy she would respond within the day (usually an hour) and was always so friendly. The cost is well worth it for the service that you receive. The day before we brought things to be set up and then picked them up the day after the wedding. Colby was there for our rehearsal and day of and was so knowledgeable and easy to work with. The whole experience was so easy and I was really able to enjoy the process. I would choose the Bridges over and over again for my wedding day!!

My husband and I got married at the Bridges Golf Club and could not be more happy with our decision! We had our ceremony on the Garden Terrace, cocktail hour in the Clubhouse and our reception in the Garden Pavilion. The entire wedding was beautiful!  
  
Sandy and her whole team are AMAZING to work with! They were more than helpful throughout the entire process. I had lots of questions about the big day, and they always responded in a timely manner, and were so helpful to me! I was able to meet with Sandy and go over all of the small details which made me feel so much more comfortable through this whole planning process.   
  
The food was delicious! The appetizers were delicious! (My favorite being the chicken cordon bleu croquettes.) We had a plated dinner with the guests option of prime rib, chicken florentine, or spinach and cheese raviolis. I received many compliments on how good the dinner was! The portions were a great size and well presented. I could not be happier with how well the food turned out!  
  
The venue has a great list of preferred vendors that we used for a couple of our vendors. They were all amazing as well. I would highly recommend The Bridges Golf Club for anyone planning a wedding and searching for a beautiful venue!

This was the perfect venue for us to get married. I wanted to have my wedding somewhere that would be easy, fun and beautiful without having to do a lot of DIY stuff, or organizing/planning. The staff at Bridges do so much to help make your day go as smoothly as possible! It is such a beautiful location, you don't need any extra decorations, lighting, etc. or anything to make it look amazing. They are total professionals when it comes to the wedding business. Responsive, had answers/solutions for everything, organized. The wedding planners work with you on the budget, and are very accommodating when making special requests. The location is great too, because it is nearby so many hotels and easy to get to from anywhere in the bay area. 100% recommend the Bridges if you want a care-free, wonderful, fun and beautiful wedding, that can fit your budget .

We knew right away we wanted to have our wedding at Bridges. We loved the feel of the venue the moment we drove in and we looked forward to our guests having that same first impression. Not only was the ceremony and reception space beautiful, we found the prices were very reasonable for the Bay Area. Another bonus was the warmer weather in the Tri-Valley (we’re from SF) and the grounds make for great photo ops.   
The planning process leading up to wedding day was smooth and easy and we have to attribute that to the wonderful staff there. Whenever we had questions, Sandy would get back to us promptly. Also, the day of captain that’s provided by the venue actually does a good amount of duties, such as setting up guestbook table and helping with ceremony procession.   
The staff at the reception was attentive and friendly. It was also really nice that they set up a table with the appetizers and sparkling wine in the clubhouse for the bridal party to enjoy and relax separate from the guests at cocktail hour. The lamb loli-chops were delicious, by the way.  
Overall, great experience and we had an amazing wedding at Bridges!

The Bridges was worth every penny! We had amazing weather for our April 2016 5:00 pm wedding. Everything went smooth. We went with a Spanish theme and from the tile on the roof to the roses in the garden everything flowed together. We had our ceremony outside on the grass with the white rose bushes as our back ground. Cocktail hour was held at the Club House and although it was warm out all the doors were opened to let our guest sit outside or inside.   
The Grand Pavilion was perfect, loved how there was enough space for our tables, there was more than enough room to dance and the sunset and night views were amazing.   
We planned our wedding for a little over a year and Sandy was great to work with. I do not regret anything at all, having our wedding at the Bridges was a dream come true.

We had our winter wedding at Bridges this last weekend. It was absolutely beautiful. Sandy was so helpful, patient, professional, welcoming, accommodating, and so, so much more! She answered all of our MANY questions in a timely manner and was always so kind about it. The rest of the Bridges staff did a great job from setting up for the ceremony and reception, and the food was AMAZING! If you haven't tried their pumpkin soup, you need to! Thank you Sandy and everyone else for your hard work. We couldn't have asked for a better wedding!!

We had our wedding at The Bridges Golf Club, and it was a wonderful experience from start to finish. Sandy and Katie were wonderful to work with throughout the planning process, super responsive with all of our questions, and Rachel was the perfect event captain the day of our wedding, while Dean was fantastic to work with on our wine inquiries and requests. Everything turned out so beautifully, and the staff on the day of the event was exceptional. We had a smaller wedding of about 80 guests, and the Clubhouse was the perfect venue for a smaller wedding reception (they have a larger space for bigger weddings as well), plus the garden terrace was absolutely stunning for the ceremony. Looking at various venues, we were really happy with both the indoor and outdoor spaces at The Bridges, and because the indoor space was quite lovely, it didn't require a ton of additional decoration. Additionally, they have a list of preferred vendors, which helped tremendously since we had a relatively short period of time to plan, and all of their recommendations were top notch.

We had our beautiful wedding at Bridges a week ago, and it was amazing. As a venue, Bridges is gorgeous, and provides a lot of scenic outdoor areas for photos. We had our reception in the Clubhouse, which has pretty chandeliers and a lovely fireplace where the sweetheart table was. With just under 100 guests, and the space was intimate but not crowded. It was also nice having some outdoor areas where folks could take a minute to cool off when taking a break from dancing.   
  
From the planning side of things, Katie M. and Sandy T. were very responsive, professional, and helpful. They did their best to make sure I knew what options were available to us, and to help out where they could. Our event captain was friendly and helpful the day of as well.   
  
The food was delicious and we got a lot of compliments. It was great that we didn't have to deal with a separate catering company; it's all through Bridges. It also didn't completely break the bank.   
  
Our day went so amazingly well! If you're considering the Bridges, you will not be disappointed!

The Bridges Golf Club turned out to be an amazing venue for our wedding. We actually booked The Bridges as our venue based upon a recommendation from my cousin/coordinator without even personally visiting it since we live out of state. The first time we saw the venue, our jaws dropped. The pictures very accurately represent how beautiful the venue is, but it is even better in person. We primarily worked with Katie in the planning process, and she was quick to return our emails, ask us for details, and answer our questions. Katie was genuinely nice (in contrast with a couple other venues we considered) and gave her honest opinion on what aspects of the wedding options were most effective and valuable. She worked with our travel schedule to plan a tasting and to go over the final details of the wedding. After we met with her going over all the details, we felt very comfortable about our wedding, and had a clear picture of what was finalized and what we had left to plan. During the rehearsal and the ceremony, Andi was very helpful in getting our group organized and instructing us on what we needed to do. Our banquet captain was also extremely helpful and very nice and kept everything running smoothly through the reception. Throughout the day, Danielle helped to drive the limo golf cart and helped to entertain my 4 year old son during pictures, which was EXTREMELY helpful. Everyone was AMAZED at how delicious ALL the food was, from the hors d'ourves to the sushi to the prime rib to the late night churros. There wasn't a food item served that people didn't love. Even our "foodiest" friends remarked at how much they loved the food.  
  
Thank you to everyone who helped make our day perfect!

On June 21, 2015 I married my best friend in the presence of our loved ones at the most beautiful venue! Both my husband and I loved everything about the bridges golf club and both agree that everything went so smoothly from the entire planning process to the wedding day. The staff at the bridges golf course were soooo incredibly helpful through the entire process. They always answered any questions or concerns we had and were very attentive to our needs. We loved how smoothly things went on our wedding day that we wish we could do it over and over again! We have even considered doing a big wedding anniversary celebration at the bridges golf club again in the future!!

Our July 17, 2015 wedding at Bridges Golf Club was absolutely the most beautiful day of my life! From beginning to end, the day ran so smoothly! The food was out of this world delicious, and we have been getting non-stop compliments on it! Our guests have also expressed to us how kind the serving staff was as well! Every single little (and big) request/table/etc. I had was executed perfectly the day of. And as any planning bride knows, that is one of the anxious feelings we all have! Bridges rocked it! From the very beginning, Katie M. (catering sales manager) and Sandy T. (director of catering) were so unbelievably helpful and sweet. I’ll never forget the feeling of the first time we came to visit and how pumped up they got us! We knew it was the perfect place for our wedding, and we booked that day! The ladies took the reins from there and kept excellent communication with me throughout the next year…they made life so easy, I almost felt like I wasn’t doing anything at times! We were introduced to our day-of captain, Andi, the night before the wedding and she was amazing as well. It was impressive to us how much she knew about our wedding without being there from the beginning! I felt instantly calm after meeting her, especially knowing that the day would run in her care. The entire Bridges staff as a whole works together like a well-oiled machine! Everybody we worked with on staff was genuine, kind, and respectful at all times. That meant a lot to Travis and I. One of my favorite things about Bridges is that you could have a wedding there without even decorating at all, it is simply gorgeous on its own! Needless to say, I love bridges. I would recommend Bridges 1,000 times over to anyone who wants an absolute gem of a venue for a great price! Our wedding day was the best day of my life and Bridges will always hold a very special place in my heart!

I had my wedding here and had an outdoor ceremony, that then flowed into cocktail hour in the clubhouse, and the reception in the Grand Pavilion. Everything ran so smoothly. Andi was our day of coordinator and she was professional and easy to work with. I didn't have to worry about a thing the day of. From day one Katie and Sandy worked with us, answering all sorts of questions through email that I might have - and responded quickly :0) The grounds were beautiful, staff was amazing. At the end of the night they were efficient and helped us clean up and pack up our belongings. I had a fabulous experience at Bridges.

I had my wedding (70 people) here Thursday July 2, 2015. After looking for venues across the bay area, it became clear that we would get the most bang for our buck with Bridges, without sacrificing quality or beauty.   
  
Bridges was the only venue that offered both beautiful outdoor AND indoor ceremony options. I had noticed last year that a lot of places only offered nice outdoor ceremony locations but their indoor ceremony and reception locations were mediocre or resembled a community center space. Seeing as I'm not one to gamble on weather, I was looking for a place that had a beautiful indoor space for both the ceremony and reception. Enter Bridges.   
  
The ceremony took place in their fireside room in front an enormous white columned fireplace with chandelier hanging overhead. The reception took place in their clubhouse (connected to the fireside room) which was equally as lovely and conveniently connected to the bar. Our guests were able to seamlessly transition from the fireside room ceremony to the bar and then dinner. We also had use of the outdoor patio throughout the event to sit back with their cocktail and overlook the beautiful golf course and hills.   
  
For dinner we chose the beef tenderloin, wild mushroom chicken, and spinach and cheese raviolis, and side salad. While we didn't get to sample the raviolis during our tasting, we chose them based on previous yelp reviews and based on the feedback we received, they did not disappoint. We particularly enjoyed the beef and chicken and overheard a table say how awesome the beef was.   
  
The staff were pleasant, helpful, friendly, prompt, and professional.   
  
I highly recommend Bridges if you are looking for a venue that offers a variety of gorgeous settings and tasty meals without having to take out a loan. May I also recommend a weekday wedding? The perks were awesome! You will NOT regret getting married here. Just take a tour and see.

We had our wedding at Bridges. From start to finish the staff is amazing and professional. We worked with Sandy, Katie, Amber and Andi. All amazing.   
  
Andi is a life saver and made the day of easy and not stressful. She was our event coordinator and did so much for us. She went above and beyond the call of duty and was just amazingly patient. I can not stress how amazing Andi is.   
  
The food was good, only thing is I wish they had set aside our food since we had 2 bites of it. So an advice for brides let them know to pack up your food if you do not eat it. By the time we had asked for it the food was already thrown out.  
  
The venue itself is gorgeous. It rained the night before our wedding but the grass was not as wet as I had imagined.   
  
Again the staff is amazing. The venue is beautiful. Andi is a god send.   
  
Thanks Bridges for making our day special.

We had our small wedding here in May of 2015. I couldn't have been more pleased with how everything was handled..customer service, food, cleanliness, timing, everything. We worked with Katie from the moment we booked this venue until the day of the wedding, she was always helpful and happy to answer all of my questions and returned emails in a timely manner. We also worked with Rachel and Andi the day of the wedding, they also were very helpful in making sure all of the details to the wedding were in place.   
  
I believe for what we paid to host our wedding at Bridges, was well worth it! The food was amazing, the staff were awesome, and everyone raved about how stunning the grounds of Bridges Golf Club were. I only wished that the day had gone by a bit slower so I could have enjoyed it a little more :)

We got married here 2/22/15. The whole experience was super easy from start to finish. They truly take care of you! From the 1st meeting with Sandy to the several meetings with Katie to the food tasting and actual day... It all went really smooth. They are so responsive with emails, phone calls, etc. They really put you at ease. The day of my wedding, the staff took care of literally everything. All we had to do was drop off our things and they set it all up. Just the way I wanted. In addition, this place is GORGEOUS! Our photos and video turned out beautifully with the beautiful background! Love love love! I would highly recommend this venue. Hopefully I can use their venue for other events in the future. They were fantastic! Thanks staff at bridges!!! 5 stars (0;

Had our wedding here 3/7/15. Customer service is an AMAZING 10/10. We worked with Sandy, Katie and Amber and they were extremely responsive via e-mail everytime we had a question. They were also very easy to work with and super accommodating to all of our needs.  
  
Venue: 10/10  
Food: 10/10  
Customer Service: 10/10  
  
Their prices are also more than fair and I would highly recommend The Bridges to anyone.

Our decision to have our wedding at the Bridges is one of the best ones we have made! It's a beautiful location with great views and many places for great photos. We chose to have our ceremony in the Fireside Room and the reception in the View and Fireside Rooms. We had a vision of what we wanted the space to look like and we were not disappointed. We primarily worked with Katie and we can't say enough about her. She was always quick to respond and happy to provide suggestions. The event team has thought through every detail and were happy to accommodate our requests. They "day of" staff was phenomenal and every last detail was taken care of for us. From small details such as giving children their meals first to the bigger details of dinner service in general, everything was flawless! Christina & Steve 2.27.15

Thank you to the Bridges staff, especially Sandy, for helping me to create a most beautiful and elegant winter wedding day. I recommend this facility to anyone who seeks a breathtakingly beautiful facility (inside and out).  
  
A few highlights:  
1\. The staff was polite and responsive all the way from one year before the wedding to the day of the wedding. For example, we brought lots of cups, trays and vases for a hot chocolate bar. We also had to bring the fixings in sealed bags (i.e. Heath bar, etc). It was fairly complex but Sandy and the team were on it! They had our mugs and tables set up the day before so we could decorate and personalize. This is what any bride wants - the chance to be creative!!  
  
2\. As we planned the event we periodically needed to "stop in" and check out the venue. We were welcomed to do this at anytime.  
  
The wedding day:  
  
1\. My husband and I were parched before entering the Garden Pavilion. Without asking, the staff brought us drinks and made sure our food was right at our place when we sat down!  
  
2\. As the day progressed photos, cake cutting, dances and so forth needed to fit in somewhere. The staff helped us, gently but firmly, to stick to our timeline. It was wonderful to know that we could "be present" during the reception while knowing that they were looking out for our time. In the end all of our "moments" happened just as we had hoped!  
  
3\. The facility lends itself to incredibly beautiful photo ops. We took some classic photos and also added some fun golf shots. Thank you to the pro shop for lending us two clubs!   
  
4\. Our guests raved about the menu items. We opted for a brunch event and the french toast was a big hit!

I couldn't have asked for a better venue to have my wedding reception. The staff was impeccable and the food was phenomenal. The staff helped make sure every thing was on schedule and the setup turned out wonderful. Sandy is an awesome wedding planner and from the beginning of planning right up until my wedding day, she was there to answer questions and create exactly what I wanted from the venue. I would definitely have another event at this venue in the future. It is a beautiful place with wonderful people!

From the moment I saw the View and Fireside room, I knew it was the perfect venue for my small/intimate wedding. It's absolutely gorgeous and the customer service is top notch! They also have the Garden Pavilion for bigger weddings...so save yourself some time and headache and stop by to see how breathtaking your big day can be!  
  
I had the pleasure of working with Katie, Sandy, Marisa and Jaime.  
  
THANK YOU for the VIP teatment! I will definitely recommend you to my family and friends.

We are so happy that we chose Bridges for our ceremony and wedding! We looked at several other locations, but Bridges was the only place that had both the beautiful outdoor scenery for pictures and a beautiful indoors for the reception. Although I’d always envisioned an outdoor ceremony, I fell in love with the romantic Fireside room setting. And all of the other reviews were right – the Bridges staff provides excellent, friendly service from beginning until the very end and the food is great wedding food. I worked with Katie most of the time, who always responded quickly and was so patient with all of my many questions. Sandy and Amber also provided helpful, friendly service on the days that Katie was not there. We appreciated that they happily accommodated all of our requests (e.g. changing the house red from cab to merlot, changing the dipping sauce for one of our hors d’ouevre, doing a duet plate with beef tenderloin instead of filet, etc.). The day-of event captain and other staff were also so helpful and friendly – our night went so smoothly! We and our guests had a wonderful time!

The Bridges Golf Club produces beautiful weddings! We absolutely loved having our wedding there and we would not have changed one thing about the wedding day, everything turned our perfectly. The wedding day coordinator made sure everything ran smoothly behind the scenes and Bridges always got back to us quickly during the wedding planning process. This venue is so beautiful all of our guests are still commenting on how great the setting and food was!

The Bridges Golf Club is such a beautiful place that each of our guests were impressed. Sandy Tijero (Director of Catering) and Katie Montgomery (Catering Sales Manager) were extremely helpful, professional, and responsive during the wedding planning process. Marisa (Event Captain) and her team were very prepared, professional, responsible, and did their best to accommodate any of our last minute changes on the wedding date. The Bridges team and the beautiful venue made our wedding a dream come true. We will definitely recommend this venue to our friends or families, and to anyone who are looking for a perfect venue for their big day.

Sandy at The Bridges Golf Club was amazing. Their team helped me a lot in getting all the details for my wedding. We only had our reception in the Garden Pavilion and it was beautiful with all the scenery. Sandy was very good at keeping me up to date of what details were due and gave me a good timeline. She always responded and if she was out of office there was always someone else that was able to help me. The staff was very professional the day of our wedding. I would definitely recommend this location even for smaller weddings. They have different rooms for smaller occasions.

I am a frequent golfer at the course and wanted to show my fiance this venue when deciding where to have our wedding. Once she saw it, she was sold. The views from the ceremony on grass were amazing. The reception at the Garden Pavilion was perfect for what we were envisioning, and we did not need make any changes to it, which made life easy.   
  
What really made life easy when planning the wedding was the staff at the Bridges. They were very responsive and accommodating to our needs. We really did not have to worry about many things as the staff are very professional, experienced, and know exactly what they are doing. There were no delays to anything and our wedding day went to plan. A golf cart and a very informative and accommodating driver were provided to us for taking pictures around the golf course. Our guests raved out the views and the food and said it was the best wedding venue they had been to. We are extremely happy to have celebrated our wedding at The Bridges Golf Club.

We were blessed to have made The Bridges Golf Club one of our first visits when searching for the perfect ceremony / reception venue. The staff greeted us like we were old friends, whose wedding they couldn't wait to be a part of! They made us feel right at home, and for the services they provided the price was beyond reasonable.   
  
For the 11 months leading up to the Big Day we were in constant communication with their wedding staff, who kept this Bride and Groom confident that all will go as planned, and even better! They handled and organized every element of our Big Day day with great tips and suggestions; their staff was so on top of all the moving-parts that our only responsibility was to relax, celebrate, and make memories with friends and family.   
  
Our guests enjoyed themselves so much, to this day, they are still calling and emailing us about how "it was the best wedding I've ever been to !" We've received nothing but great feedback about how everyone felt that the day flowed so well that they truly felt they were guests of a "celebrity" grand event. The food was phenomenal! - from the appetizers to the main courses, everything was 5 star. The bartenders were polite and well organized, which kept the libations flowing and the overall staff made all our vendors feel welcome and assisted.   
  
A note on vendors; when you tell them you're event is at The Bridges, they even light up and have nothing but good things to say about working with them in the past!   
  
Our "day of" wedding coordinator was extremely helpful and kept all of us informed and punctual, and their waiting staff was the most polite and regimented that we have ever seen. A few days after the wedding, they contacted us with congratulations and a note that we had 35 bottles of wine to give us due to them not being consumed - their honesty will always be something we remember and tell others about when they are planning big venues. We recommend to everyone! - The Ramos family

I was planning a wedding from the east coast and Sandy helped me out with every possible aspect. She gave me great recommendations for vendors and was so accomdating when I kept changing things. I had only been there once so I was very nervous about decorating a place that i briefly visited but Sandy was gracious enough to send me different photos of the venue to see how other brides had done certain things.   
Come the day of Rachal was our wedding coordinator. Wow , she was amazing! She had the whole day run perfectly! My wedding guests loved her and the staff becuase they were so prompt and kind.   
The next day all my guests could talk about was how beautiful Bridges was, how the food was fantastic, and how the staff was awesome! They were all in love with it. So much that my younger cousin from Colorado now is looking to have her wedding there.  
You cannot go wrong with having your wedding here. My ceremony and reception were perfect.

Words cannot describe my extreme gratitude for the Bridges and their staff for making my wedding the most amazing day of my life! From day one the Bridges staff was courteous, helpful, fun and never made me feel like a crazy bride! I worked with Sandy, who is absolutely amazing. I have to say that every single person who I came into contact with from Sandy, to the food coordinator, to my event captain just exceeded my expectations of what would happen the day of! The food was amazing, people are still telling me how awesome the lamb was (I am sure my now husband is still thinking about it too) and my rooms (I did the venue buyout) were gorgeous! They accommodated my large wedding party down to the tunnels with my photographer by lending us golf carts and you can imagine how awesome that was! I have absolutely no regrets at all and would HIGHLY recommend the Bridges over any other venue (and I did look quite extensively in the area and Bridges is by far the nicest, gorgeous venue!!). I again just have to give a HUGE thank you to Sandy and all employees of the Bridges, you made my wedding a dream come true and I cannot begin to thank you enough for everything that you did! Its no wonder they are a Knot pick!! Thank you and to all brides looking for venues pick the Bridges!!!

We got married at The Bridges on 2/17/13 and I could not be happier with the experience! I actually cannot believe how smoothly EVERYTHING went. No hick-ups!   
  
We worked with Alicia at first but mostly Sandy. They are both AMAZING! When we were deciding on the venue I had a lot of questions and Alicia answered all my emails in a very timely manner and with incredibly helpful and thoughtful answers. Sandy helped us actually plan the wedding. She had great advice, also answered emails incredibly quickly and made sure every single detail was taken care of. I could not believe how perfect everything was! I cannot thank those two ladies enough!  
  
Rachel was our day of person and she gets five stars as well. I had a wedding day coordinator so I didn't work that directly with Rachel, but I'm sure she was awesome, and I did ask her to make sure there were snacks in the bridal room after the ceremony and there were. All the staff at the Bridges are professional, helpful, and wonderful to work with!  
  
If I had to say one tiny thing that happened that wasn't how we planned it was that when we did our food tasting we ordered the salmon with pomegranate au jus. It was delicious at the tasting (our favorite thing we tasted). Day of the wedding the salmon was served with was a different sauce and it wasn't served with these delicious mash potatoes that we tasted at the tasting. To be honest, the day of the wedding, I didn't even notice, but the next day I remembered. I really didn't care, but if that kind of thing would bother you, I recommend checking in on that before the big day.  
  
Other than that the food was great! I don't eat red meat myself, but we had quite a foodie crowd who raved about the prim rib. I thought the salmon was pretty good despite it not being with the sauce we planned, and the raviolis were pretty good too. The appetizers were awesome!  
  
I cannot express how satisfied I was with the Bridges. I am thrilled I chose to get married there. I can't imagine there is a

There is not an hour (let alone a day) that goes by where I don't think about our wedding. And not one of those thoughts are "I wish I had done this" or "I had hoped that would have been better". They are "that was the most amazing and perfect day of my life". :) Is that gushy enough for you?!  
  
But really, everyone says that planning a wedding can be stressful, challenging and exhausting...and looking back I didn't feel that way at all. And much of that is thanks to the entire staff at The Bridges who made everything so easy from start to finish. I couldn't have been happier with the final product. Every person that I worked with (sales, planning, catering & day of) were fantastic. They were incredibly organized, flexible, responsive, pleasant and patient.   
  
I came in knowing exactly what we wanted (some call it bossy or head strong, I call it detail oriented and determined :) and everyone was very receptive and accommodating. I literally didn't worry about one thing all night which is exactly how it should be.  
  
Throughout the planning process I had a suggestion for the sales team on sending out payment reminders further in advance so the couple has ample time to prepare. The staff took this feedback to heart and implemented a change immediately. Just a small situation that shows that they listen, care and act.  
  
Some may say that the bride and groom have a different take on things since they are in a world of their own. Fair enough. But I can tell you that every one of my guests had the same rave reviews. About the service, the food, the venue and the staff. I am still getting notes from family and friends who enjoyed the evening as much as we did.  
  
I would recommend The Bridges for any event, but it really is the perfect place to host your perfect wedding day.

My husband and I just got married at The Bridges on August 25th, 2012. We could not have been happier with the venue we had chosen. Sandy our coordinator was amazing from the get go and just made everything so easy for us. We had such a flawless experience with this place overall and could not have asked for anything more. We did a venue buyout, so we were the only party on the premises that entire day (besides the golfers which we did not even notice). I strongly recommend doing so and The Bridges easily accommodated our 230 guests and we had more than enough room on the grounds. We did our ceremony outside in the garden terrace, had our cocktail hour in the clubhouse and then our reception in the pavilion.   
Since we had an open bar, they allowed us to waive the champagne toast fee since everyone could hold up their own class of what they were drinking. I also had cupcakes instead of a wedding cake and they waived the cake cutting fee. These 2 fees being waived could have really added up.  
My contact Sandy was incredible. I could bug her with any question at any time and she was more than happy to help me out. She was very personable, organized and on top of everything. I am so happy I had gotten to be able to work with her. Our day of coordinator Molly was also awesome and was on site the entire night making sure things ran smoothly.   
I would strongly recommend this venue to any bride and groom out there. It was well worth every penny!!!

I had my wedding here on 8/18/12 and it was beautiful. My friends and family had a great time and had nothing but nice things to say about Bridges Golf Club. Sandy and Alicia (the event coordinators) were wonderful and answered all my questions in a timely manner. Would recommend it if you are looking at golf courses in San Ramon.

My husband and I recently had our wedding reception at the Bridges Golf Club and receive numerous compliments about the location, food, and service. Not only did we feel that the venue was a fantastic place to have our reception, but the event coordinators went above and beyond to accommodate our requests.   
  
We booked the venue in early January and had about 6 months to plan the entire reception from where we live, which is on the east coast. I chose this venue because of location, capacity, and professionalism of Sandy (our event coordinator). Our schedule for planning our reception was tight and we were limited on the amount of times we would actually be in California to do any wedding planning. Sandy, of course, assisted with everything - from food tasting, to arranging the set-up of the room as early as possible, and worked around my schedule for all meetings. If Sandy wasn't available to help by phone or email, she asked us to speak with Alicia, the other event coordinator. I was apprehensive at first that I was getting brushed aside, but that was NOT the case whatsoever. Alicia stepped right in and knew exactly what to do! Since I was planning this reception from across the country, Sandy responded to every email in a timely matter and made sure all my requests were met.   
  
The location of the venue is beautiful and for a summer wedding in July it couldn't have been more perfect. The room we used seats 300 comfortably, even though we only had 130 guests. But, we did have a DJ, photo booth and even created a lounge with furniture. I think without the extra furniture, the room may have felt a little empty for a party of our size.   
  
The food options vary and we chose NY steak, Salmon, and Eggplant parmesan for our reception. The service was wonderful and the food delicious!   
  
If you are considering this venue, I would make sure to see it for yourself during the day and at night to get the true effect/feel of the lighting and location. In my opinion, this venue is fantastic for larger parties and spacious for smaller ones. Sandy and Alicia truly are a joy to work with when planning a wedding or event.

The staff was beyond friendly and helpful! More than we ever could have hoped for. As a bride, I was frantic and crazed that every little detail was perfect and Jacque, Alicia, Allan and Amanda handled all of our requests and specifics with ease and a huge smile on their faces! It was amazing.   
The food was amazing, the ambiance was great, and we even got comments on how friendly the bar and waitstaff were. Everyone had a wonderful time...including me, the bride! On the day of the wedding, I was so at ease knowing everything was handled.

We had our ceremony on the grass which had spectacular views. After our ceremony we went into the golf shop and were greeted with champagne and h'orderves (which we ordered). Reception was in the club room/view room. The staff was awesome in guiding us through the wedding. They sure were on their game and when I didn't think they knew what was going on they were 2 steps ahead of us! The food was awesome at the wedding and not like usual wedding food. We also got to taste the food before hand and it was great. The bridges is perfect for a couple on a budget and well worth your time. Beautiful scenery and great staff! The perfect place to have a wedding!

The Bridges is so beautiful and scenic. It is the perfect venue for our spring wedding. Our pictures and video are both so breathtaking. Everyone was so helpful and always ready to address all our concerns, especially Alicia & Jacqui (wedding coordinators), Allan (food & beverage manager), and Benny, who was our personal server for the night. Benny made me feel like a queen! Our wedding is a dream come true and our guests were raving about it even up to this day!

When I walked in there and saw a set-up of another wedding, I knew this was absolutely the perfect place to have the reception. The Garden Pavillion room is spacious with large open windows and great views. There is even a special area to display your cake. And down the street, there is a beautiful fountain to take pictures, but it's only on during the weekends. Alicia and Julie were very helpful.

The food was amazing, and the venue itself is gorgeous. If you book the clubhouse it's very inexpensive for what you get. I would highly recomend it to any of my friends.

From the very beginning the staff at the Bridges Golf Club were so great to work with. Sandy, the Director of Catering Services was quick to respond to my endless emails and questions and was so flexible with our requests. Since I did not hire a wedding coordinator, it was so great to receive the stress free customer service the Bridges staff provided. As for the wedding itself, the bridal party was well taken care of. They make sure that there's a place to hide in the gift shop after the ceremony and even set out a table of hors d'oeuvres, champagne and cocktails for the groomsmen and bridesmaids after the wedding ceremony. Their event captain and the rest of the event staff were so well organized and made sure that the entire wedding ran smoothly from the ceremony set up to the sparkler send off and conclusion. We were so happy with our experience and our guests had a great time.

We held our wedding here at Bridges a few weeks ago. While venue shopping, Bridges was by far the most beautiful (and reasonably priced) venue that we looked at in the East Bay. The ceremony took place on the beautiful outdoor Garden Terrace (during the recent heat wave, so we were dying in the 105F heat), and the reception in the grand Garden Pavilion.   
Aside from the gorgeous venue, working with the staff was quite easy during our wedding planning process. Our pre-wedding contacts were Katie and Sandy, who answered our (many, many) emailed questions very quickly, usually within 24 hours. They were a pleasure to work with, and made the wedding planning relatively painless. Since wedding planning requires juggling many things at once, they were good about sending us reminder emails for payment due dates and deciding on our ceremony/reception details. They were also good to bounce our ideas off of. On the day of the wedding, our day of coordinators were Andi and Rinna, and Rachel was our setup coordinator. They were a dream to work with (both before and during the wedding day) and definitely helped out a lot to make our special day happen! We had very detailed instructions of how we wanted things set up, and they were able to make everything happen exactly as we wanted it. They even provided us with plenty of ice water and snacks to keep us from passing out in the heat. They touched base with us several times during the night (but not so much that it was annoying) to make sure that we (and the vendors) were all on the same page for the next event on our timeline.  
I will definitely recommend The Bridges to anyone looking for an elegant and classic-looking venue, not only for the gorgeous scenery, but also for the amazing staff!

Beautiful Venue!

My husband and I just had our wedding at The Bridges this past Memorial Day weekend and were SO happy with the turnout! We originally booked our wedding for 5/28/21 but postponed to 5/28/22 because of COVID. We mainly worked with Sandy and she is super responsive and professional. I found The Bridges on "here comes the guide" when I was filtering for "all inclusive" wedding venues--meaning they come with food, drinks, tables, chairs, etc. That already made wedding planning so much easier for me. The Bridges was also one of the more affordable venues we visited, which I sooo appreciate.  
  
We hired a different day-of coordinator, so they actually ran our ceremony rehearsal, but Emma from the Bridges was super friendly and professional also. She drove us around on the golfcart for all of our pictures, which was so nice!  
  
About the venue itself--it is beautiful and doesn't need too many decorations! The ceremony site is already picture perfect with the rose bushes, and the reception room is huge, with tall ceilings and 3 iron chandeliers. We ended up using two of their preferred vendors: A Loves in Bloom (florals) & Fantasy Sound Events (chandelier & custom initial light)--we were so happy with both. They are preferred vendors for a reason!  
  
We also got SO many compliments on the cocktail hour food and dinner entrees. One person told me "best wedding food i've had"!! We had the prime rib and salmon as our entrees and both were excellent.  
  
Thank you to The Bridges, Sandy, Emma, + the whole special events team for making our day so perfect! I can honestly say nothing went wrong the whole day (or at least I don't know about it :D)!

An amazing venue choice

We got married in April 2022. After touring multiple venues, we landed on Bridges Golf Club. For a large 180 person wedding, Bridges was a great value and the venue was so beautiful, minimal decor was needed. Working with Bridges was very easy. I worked with Sandy during my entire time planning and she was extremely responsive to all of my questions. I found Bridges to be somewhat flexible - I switched some components around for our food choices. We chose the prime rib and the salmon and the food was amazing! All of our guests raved about dinner. Our wedding day went so smoothly. The venue looked amazing. They had a few cocktail hour appetizers ready for us when we sat down to dinner. They helped shuttle us to sunset photos. They were flexible with the timeline when we needed cocktail hour to extend a little longer. Overall, I was so happy with our choice to get married at Bridges Golf Club and would recommend this venue to anyone looking in the east bay.

Fantastic Experience!

We got married on 9.18.2020 at The Bridges Golf Club and we seriously could not be happier with how it turned out!   
Quick background: We were originally supposed to have our reception in the Clubhouse/Fireside Room. About a month after the Covid-19 shelter in place orders, Sandy (Director of Catering Sales) contacted us and gave us a choice to postpone or move the reception to the Garden Pavilion (it had not been reserved yet) to allow for more social distancing. We chose to move to the Pavilion. As our date got closer, and indoor dining was not allowed, Sandy let us know if we were to continue with moving forward for 9.18, our reception would be outdoors and our guest count would go down to 30. We let her know that we wanted to wait to make the final decision of moving outdoors til September 1 (ideally hoping indoor dining would open back up) and she was ok with that. Through the whole process, questions, and concerns, Sandy was very helpful and responded quickly. We did end up having to cut our guest count (as indoor dining still had not opened) and were allowed 50 guests at ceremony and 30 at reception. Due to this cut, our total food & beverage minimum went down. It did however make the cost/person compared with the total food/beverage minimum more expensive, but due to the circumstances, we understood. We were able to add the amazing short ribs late night snack and our guests raved about it. Due to the reception being outdoors, we worked with A Grand Affair to have tables with umbrellas for our guests. For the rehearsal ceremony and day of coordinator, we worked with Colby and she was amazing! She helped with the timing of everything and was very flexible with our storage of decorations. We didn't feel worried about anything during the day! There was even a miscommunication with our 6 inch cake and sheet cake with the delivery and staff. She contacted our baker and figured out the details right away. Colby also drove us in the golf cart to our picture destinations before our ceremony and during twilight hour. We felt so taken care of with her!   
It definitely was not what we had pictured our wedding to be like when we first chose & started planning with Bridges, but how it ended up was absolutely perfect for us.   
We would highly recommend this venue for a wedding, whether it's indoor or outdoor!

Dream Wedding!

It was always my dream to have my wedding at the Bridges (hometown girl!), and it definitely lived up to the hype! Aside from the gorgeous venue, Sandy and Celena were incredibly easy to work with, responsive, and made us feel reassured everything would go great. Our day went smoothly and beautifully.

Alicia was very helpful! Very easy to work with, they set up everything for me so we didn't have to the day of the wedding. Guests really enjoyed the food, although I thought it didn't taste as good as it did on our tasting (thats the difference I guess when cooking 1 meal versus 200 meals). A little frustrating that you ahd to meet the minimum for dollar amount for food, and that other rental items from them does not get to be included in that (ex. charger or chairs). Overall beautiful wedding, and great staff to work with.

After visiting about 8 venues, we knew Bridges was our venue. From the patio area looking on to the amazing rolling greens hills, we could already imagine our ceremony taking place with the white rose bushes in the backdrop. The garden pavilion was spacious with the alcove area for the cake table and wall of windows offering natural light and breathtaking views of the golf course. We worked meticulously with Sandy and Elizabeth for the planning, and with Sylvia for the rehearsal and day-of as she was our event captain. Sandy and Elizabeth were so responsive and very sweet people who were there to ease your worries. We booked the Bridges 14 months before our wedding day, and every time I emailed a random question, it was answered within a few hours.   
  
You think you've done all the planning you can do, but some things are bound to come up, and I'm so thankful Sylvia was there. One example is, I was trying to bunch together some roses to make a toss bouquet. Sylvia was so sweet and attentive and took it upon herself to take care of it and told me not to worry (even when she had a list of tasks to take care of). For all the problems we encountered on our wedding day, we're glad that we're able to count on Bridges and its staff.

My fiance' and I had less then a year to plan for a wedding, so finding a venue was going to be limited with many dates already being taken. Bridges was our favorite out of the few that we checked out. The venue is so picturesque and allows for many beautiful picture opportunities. Even though a Sunday in November was one of the few of the remaining dates available, we booked it and hoped for the best that the weather would cooperate. Thank God, it was a dry day!  
  
Sandy and Katie were very professional in leading us up to the day of our wedding! Like many other reviewers have stated, they answered countless emails quickly and friendly. Sandy went above and beyond her work hours to help with time sensitive emails and last minute requests. (Thank you Sandy!) Rachel, Francisco and Andi were all accommodating on the day of. My bridesmaids enjoyed our own cocktail hour in the bridal room since we didn't have time to go to the actual cocktail hour. Francisco made sure we had appetizers and drinks!   
  
Bridges has reasonable if not better rates compared to many other popular venues for their catering, especially if you book on Sundays, they'll throw in chiavari chair rentals and they don't charge extra for cake cutting. For the budget conscious couple, I would recommend hiring a DJ or dessert/snacks vendor outside of Bridges. Thumbtack will give you competitive vendors for much less. Also if your budget allows, booking Bridges on a Friday or Saturday would give your guests the freedom to celebrate longer with you and not worrying about getting home because of work the next day.  
  
We received many compliments on how everyone enjoyed the venue and the evening with us! Bridges will always be a significant place in our hearts!

Best day ever 

My husband and I had an intimate micro wedding at the Bridges Golf Club on 11/7/20 with 30 people. Sandy was our coordinator and Colby was our day-of event captain. They were both great. Sandy tolerated my countless questions (and was very responsive) since the day we saw the venue late August 2020. Everything was initially planned outdoors (ceremony and reception) but when we saw potential colder weather/winds/rain in the forecast and it was getting darker earlier due to daylight savings, Sandy let us change our reception to the indoor clubhouse. I'm so glad we made this decision and that it was still available to us (while Contra Costa was still in the red tier). Colby was excellent during rehearsal and day-of and she chauffeured the bridal party in the limo golf cart to different locations for photography. She helped us make sure everything ran on time. We did run a couple grand over budget since we didn't realize there was a food / beverage minimum until reading the contract, but we were able to meet the minimum after buying a few bottles of wine to take home. I don't think our big day could have gone any better. I can’t wait to get our photos and video so that we can relive our special day! The venue really was lovely and it was a beautiful day to get married.

Beautiful venue

My husband and I are so happy that we chose The Bridges to host our ceremony and reception back in October. We were lucky to have beautiful weather on the day of our wedding, which meant that the ceremony was just stunning. When we were looking at different venues, we knew that we wanted to find somewhere that would be convenient for our guests coming in from out-of-town, let us host a late-night party, and provide as much as possible onsite and The Bridges nailed all of that. The venue is gorgeous and I love how our photos turned out, the staff (especially Celena) were wonderful to work with, the food was good and overall our experience was exactly what we were hoping for. In terms of value for money, The Bridges was by far one of the best in the Bay Area and I would highly recommend as a venue to anyone.

Excellent food!  
Excellent beverages!  
Excellent set up!  
Excellent service!  
Excellent location and price!  
Excellent wedding photo shot location!  
  
Becareful of wedding guests getting your wedding coordinator drunk! This can result in your venue being delayed! Don't let your guests force wedding coordinators to drink! It's not the coordinators fault but it is, cause she's on the clock, but trying to make sure everyone is happy.

The Bridges is beautiful and they helped make our wedding wonderful! They were flexible and willing to do what it took to make our day wonderful. I would highly recommend them.  
  
Some issues we had were the amount of set up time allowed for a Sunday wedding, the size of the Clubhouse space (the dividing doors presented some challenges for table layout and visibility for all of the guests), and we were quoted prices from the last year because that is when we started planning. Bridges didn't' provide an updated quote for the current year.  
  
All in all, it was a good experience.

Alicia is FANTASTIC! I love every minute working with her. Shes very responsive via phone and email and was pleasant and accomodating all the time. She was deiniftely one of the main reasons we chose this venue and she didnt disappoint. Alan, the catering director, is great and was willing to accomodate for food as best he could. They also provide decent discounts, especially for off-season weddings.  
  
The venue itself is beautiful and open. The garden pavillion for the reception has high vaulted ceilings, a beautiful walkway ramp that provided that "wow" factor of the room, and floor to ceiling windows across the back wall that provides a beautiful panoramic view of the course and San Ramon. We planned our ceremony outside and our cocktail and reception indoors. Unfortunately, due to weather, we promptly moved our ceremony indoors. The team was prompt and kept me stress free. They even gave me until noon the day OF the wedding to decide if we wanted to move the ceremony indoors or keep it outside... no hassle, no stress, just "whenever you decide". The day was overcast but the venue itself is green and lush and made for fantastic pictures.   
  
My only problem was with our wedding-day coordinators. I felt as though I was chasing them half the night, trying to figure out when things were supposed to happen. I thought it was the other way around. At some points during the night when I needed to talk to them, they were nowhere to be found. (i think it's because one was a trainee).   
  
Overall, the veue is fantastic, Alicia is wonderful, and their staff is accomodating but a bit out of touch. I would highly recommend Bridges nonetheless

Good value, good food service, pretty venue

4 stars for a wedding venue (downside is the homes in the background)  
5 stars for the catering (loved Jaime!)  
3 stars for the wedding/sales managers + less negotiable contract  
  
The Bridges is a pretty venue (minus the homes in the background) - the clubhouse & garden pavilion are gorgeous (if only the green window/door frames were a darker brown color instead). The head chef Jaime is GREAT & super accommodating/kind/humble - both during our tasting, and also even during the wedding. He was our favorite staff at the Bridges. However, we weren't the biggest fans of the wedding/catering sales managers Sandy/Celena. The positives were: responses were quick & detailed (they are professional and do follow through- so that's a "pro"). However, personality-wise, we would've preferred a warmer, more genuine personality. Out of all venues we toured, they were the least enthusiastic/helpful compared to all other venues' wedding staff.. and many things in their contract are non-negotiable (where other venues are WAY more flexible). I remember being initially sad choosing Bridges over some of the other venues primarily because I enjoyed corresponding with the other venue's staff so much more. Ultimately, things worked out. The venue is beautiful, food was good, guests were happy. Just don't expect warm fuzzy enthusiasm or a ton of flexibility in creating your dream wedding when working with them.

Terrible staffing for an upscale venue

This place was one of many that had a top rating before covid. But unfortunately it's one of many that will suffer. We just had our wedding there and I received a lot complaints from my guests that the bar service was terrible and staffing was rude and not experienced. We paid a lot of money to get this kind of embarrassing service. However the food was great. Don't recommend this place.
