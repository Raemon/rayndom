Huntsville Botanical Gardens Carriage House was the perfect location for our wedding. The staff was friendly and prompt, one staff member, Lauren, was particularly amazing and helped the day run so smoothly! The weather of course, helped enhance the venue tenfold. Our guests loved touring the gardens and seeing the newest art installations. We appreciate all the staff for helping our day be as beautiful as their garden! Highly recommend!

From the MOTB I cannot show enough gratitude to The Sonnet House. Ellen and her team made the whole wedding experience enjoyable. My daughter had a unique vision for florals&decor and they nailed it. Jared answered all my many questions during the months ahead. Mindy was so attentive & helpful during the wedding weekend. It is a well oiled machine. The whole staff executed and made the wedding day go seamless! Being a December wedding, we used the chapel for both the ceremony& reception . I couldn’t believe how fast they flipped it. I honestly didn’t worry about anything the day of wedding. I was able to enjoy my guests, being with my daughter, and living in the moment. Book Now! Mindy Welch

I couldn’t imagine myself getting married anywhere else! It was the perfect mountain wedding with plenty of space for all my guests. The ceremony was outside with the reception inside and it couldn’t have been more perfect. A great plus was the huge room with a small kitchen and bathrooms my bridesmaids and I got to use to get ready! Would 100% recommend to anyone for their special day.
