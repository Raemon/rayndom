Before reaching out to wedding photographers, determine your photography style preferences. (Here are [the wedding photography styles you should definitely know about](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-photography-styles-you-should-know).) Browse lots of [real wedding photos](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/real-weddings) and look for images that really speak to you. Do you love classical poses? Are you drawn to fun, real-life shots? Do you prefer artistic, experimental photography? Once you get a sense of what type of photography speaks to you, it’s time to start searching.

## Start Your Search

Use a trusted [wedding website](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-websites.html) to find wedding photographers in your area. Start by reviewing their portfolios and checking out their social media feeds to find their most recent work. See if their style resonates with you and if they’ve done weddings that are similar to yours.

## Reach Out

Once you’ve narrowed your list to around five “wedding photographers near me,” give them a ring. You can also send an email. Ask if they are available for your wedding date. Next, ask about their pricing. According to our [wedding photography cost guide](https://www.weddingwire.com/cost/wedding-photographer), the majority of photographers charge between $1,150 to $3,000 in the United States.

Tell the photographer a little about yourself, your [wedding venue](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-venues) and your photography style preferences. You may also want to send a few of your favorite wedding images so they have a sense of what you like.

## The Interview

Once the photographers get back to you, interview your top choices. Finding the right wedding photographer isn’t just about matching styles – it’s also about matching personalities. This person will be spending a lot of time with you on your wedding day, so make sure you feel comfortable working with them.

During the interview, ask about the photographer’s wedding packages. Many photographers offer [engagement photoshoots](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/engagement-photo-shoot-tips-and-ideas) and may be available to shoot other important events, like your [wedding shower](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/bridal-wedding-showers--t54) or [rehearsal dinner](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/rehearsal-dinner--t56).

Be clear about timing. Most photographers will shoot pre-wedding preparations all the way to the end of the reception, but it never hurts to double-check.

If you are planning a particularly large wedding of 200 or more guests, you may want to request a second photographer, so they don’t miss a single moment of the event.

Finally, ask about turnaround time. Many wedding photographers ask for at least a month to edit all their images before sending you your final album. If you want your images quickly, you’ll need to ask about that in the interview.

## Make Your Choice

After your interviews are complete, it’s time to choose your wedding photographer. You’ll need to weigh their talent, pricing, personality and wedding photography packages to make your choice. At WeddingWire, we can help you find the perfect wedding photographer for your big day. Start your search today.
