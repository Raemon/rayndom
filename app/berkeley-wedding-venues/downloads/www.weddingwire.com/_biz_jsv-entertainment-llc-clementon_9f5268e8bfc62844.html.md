The party was non stop!

A DJ can make or break your wedding. Joe definitely MADE ours! I wanted a straight up party and he delivered. He met with us a few days before and we went through every step of my day from ceremony to the last song. He exceeded expectations!

Amazing DJ

DJ Joe came prepared with a sleek DJ table, light-up props for the guests, and an amazing playlist. I received multiple compliments and our dance floor was never empty. He communicates quickly and effectively. He also helped my husband and I come up with some creative ideas when we were feeling overwhelmed. So glad we booked DJ Joe!

Best DJ ever!!!

We booked with Ryan all the way back in 2018 and like many others, had to postpone our wedding twice. We finally were able to celebrate in June of 2022 and Ryan did NOT disappoint. He was professional, so accommodating with the postponements, and communicated with us regularly. We added the dancing on a cloud option, which looked absolutely incredible! The music he played during cocktail hour, dinner, and the reception was varied, and catered to all ages. We really liked how some of the songs were more upbeat rather than quiet background music during dinner. The audio for the speeches was loud and clear, and he was so upbeat and able to get the crowd excited. We had guests come up to us all throughout the night absolutely raving about Ryan! We asked that the music for the last hour of the night be more of a “party” vibe and the songs he played had everyone on the dance floor. We could not have asked for a better DJ 🤗

Joe is the best!

We booked Joe for our original wedding day of 7/25/20, and of course had to postpone due to the pandemic to 7/31/21. Luckily Joe was available for our new date and gave us no issues with postponing. When we met with Joe for the first time, we knew right off the bat he would do an amazing job with our wedding. After we booked, every time we talked with him, he was always so genuinely excited for our day and had great energy. His ideas for song choices and mixes for certain parts of our ceremony and reception were great and showed he knew what he was doing. We also wanted our guests to be dancing the majority of the night and Joe made sure to achieve that! He knew how to read the crowd and kept the dance floor packed all night. We were super impressed with his talents and are so happy we booked him for our day!! Highly recommend him!!!

What an amazing DJ!

Joe was our DJ for our wedding and he was absolutely amazing! He helped us pick the best music from start to finish. Beautiful ceremony music that set the mood for all of our friends and family. My husband and I absolutely loved it. After the ceremony we wanted to make sure the reception would be tons of fun for dancing! We didn’t have too much of a music list (only a few must plays) because we just love all genres. He was so diverse and hit all of the good songs for all ages!! Joe reached out to us and went over everything via phone to ensure of any changes to the wedding. Multiple people complimented our DJ and said how great he was! He made this celebration a partttyy!!! Thank you again Joe!!

Joe was incredible. He kept everyone moving and was a great emcee. My wife and I have attended a few events in the past where Joe was the DJ, so we booked him for our wedding and basically let him run with it. The dance floor was packed all night! We've received numerous compliments about how great he was. One of the best around.

Best dj ever!

Joe was so awesome! He met with my husband a couple of times before the big day and went over everything with us to be sure we got what we wanted. He offered great suggestions when I had no idea what I wanted and the night of the wedding everything was perfect! Music wasn’t too loud but he knew how to get everyone up and dancing! Couldn’t have asked for a better person to DJ our wedding! Thank you!!

THE BEST IN NJ (and according to our guests, one of the best ever).

Joe is the best. He coordinated the music for our ceremony, cocktail hour and most importantly, he made our dance party everything we dreamed of. I cannot tell you how many guests told us he was the best wedding DJ they have ever heard. His online music database were you can literally choose every song you want him to play (and not play) kept the party going nonstop all night. He knows how to read the crowed, play toward the audience and mood of the room. He gets what kind of vibe the couple wants. He is not your typical wedding MC who gets on the michrophone all night and stands in the middle of the dance floor. He Gets on the mic only when necessary.   
  
Seriously, he is the best.
