I found Sydney after she popped up on my Instagram feed, and as soon as I clicked into her profile I messaged her right away to see if she was available. From the start she was so easy to plan with—responsive, friendly, and clear about everything. She arrived at our wedding venue ahead of schedule (such a pleasant surprise!) and set up seamlessly. With everything going on that day, having someone who could jump right in without any questions or issues was a huge stress reliever. Our guests absolutely loved the surprise, and her artwork was incredible. The attention to detail—especially on the dresses—and the added touches of sparkle made each piece truly beautiful. I have nothing but positive things to say about Sydney and her professionalism. We highly, highly recommend her!

Michelle's Bridal was recommended to us through our venue (Wildhorse Golf Club). Michelle was extremely helpful, very attentive, and thoughtful. She even assisted us in some ideas for party favors after we placed our invitations order. Michelle seemed to have difficulties with technology, so the ordering process was somewhat slow and tedious, but we did not mind too much. We were looking for something very classy and elegant but weren't looking to spend too much. Overall, the invitations were gorgeous and the colors were great. We did have a lot of assembly to do once the order arrived, and I was a bit confused because I thought that was something Michelle would be taking care of for us. Unfortunately this wasn't communicated well, so although I was very happy to see my order in, I wasn't thrilled at how much work I had to do to put the invites together. I think for the amount we paid, although it might not be a fortune to others, we expected a little more of the work to be done for us. Overall, I'm happy with the product and services, yet felt as though we overpaid for the amount of work we had to do ourselves. We made the best of it and had the bridesmaids come over for an invitation assembly party =D We are thankful for Michelle's services yet I think if I would have known how much work we had to do after spending the money, we might have looked elsewhere before ordering.

We were previously looking at two other websites that had the customizable poker chips and dice before we went with Vegas Wedding Favors. Lucky for us, those two companies ended up being flaky with poor customer service so we found Vegas Wedding Favors! They were professional, quick, courteous and CHEAPER!! than the other two sites. We went ahead and got poker chips, dice and some other things for ourselves. Everything was perfect, the poker chips were of good quality, not light, plastic cheap feeling at all, they sent us multiple "mock ups" to make sure the designs on both sides of the 2 different chips we ordered were EXACTLY what we wanted. I highly recommend these guys & the shipping was quick and reasonable to Hawaii.

I ordered an amazing cake topper on Etsy and it is gorgeous! It was shipped fast and packaged with care. Unfortunately I did not get to show it off at my wedding as the bakery forgot to put it on my cake or bring it to the ballroom! I am going to find a way to use it in my home as a decoration.

Sweet Favours provided elegant favours for my wedding. Everything was taken care of for me, making it easy, with no hassle. There are lots of ideas to choose from, and if you can't decide, they'll do two different ones --- every other seat. The printing on the cards is professional and the final design is elegant. I recommend this vendor to people looking for a personal, upscale touch.

I wanted something unique so I was told to look on etsy. I found what I wanted via Charmed gifts. Some great stuff! They had what I was looking for to complete my look and what I wanted for my bridesmaids. If you want some cool things to compliment your style or your wedding overall look up people on etsy.

Thanks to Melissa at Vogrins Palace, who created and quickly shipped excellent-quality, reasonably-priced wedding favors! I found this shop on Etsy and wish I could give more than 5 stars. Thank you again!

I am currently planning my wedding and found this company through The Knot App. I did not end up using them for the wedding but their work was so good that they definitely deserve a nod! Glass With A Twist did an AMAZING job!!! My fiance’s company just celebrated their 3rd year in business. I needed some custom pint glasses with the business logo on them ASAP. I put in my order, emailed them to let them know the timeline was tight, and they were able to deliver ahead of schedule! The glasses look FANTASTIC and he was ecstatic with the result! I was initially concerned given that some of the reviews talked about glasses arriving broken, but the glasses are so well bubble-wrapped (read: scissors are required to free the glasses) it has to be a carrier problem. I was also a little worried given that many of the designs advertised on the website are cheesy catchphrases and they didn’t have any samples of glassware with logos. The pint glasses look very classy and are stunning! I’m a very happy customer and would gladly recommend Glass With A Twist to ANYONE!!!

These fantastic little towels were a big hit at my shower and then again at my reception. All my guests thought they were so novel & fun...as well as useful. Gertrude's was easy to work with, attentive to my specific needs, professional, friendly just easy to work with. They were extremely helpful in guiding me to the best value for my budget. I highly recommend this unique, practical, fun ec'o towel. My cousin is ordering some for his reception.
