## About

The Sanctuary at Skyline is like having an outdoor wedding - only better because everyone is comfortable!The soaring wood paneled ceiling and spectacular glass wall are impressive by day and becomes absolutely stunning at night; the feeling is intimate and personal.

Contemporary in design, the Sanctuary features comfortable chairs and a movable alter platform, allowing for various seating configurations accommodating up to 250 seated guests. It can also be easily arranged to hold a more intimate group.

Our pipe organ remains one of the few pneumatic organs in use in the Bay Area. This instrument may be played by our Music Director or your qualified organist. The sound is dramatic, to say the least, and adds a tremendous depth to your music selections.Also available is a grand piano. The Sanctuary also can be arranged for a harpist, choir or string quartet. Although this space is acoustically alive, we do have microphones available for use; which include a lectern microphone, a hand held (or stand held) mic and two wireless microphones.

We provide a Wedding Coordinator, who will assist you with preferred vendors, organize the rehearsal and support you the day of your wedding - to make sure the Sanctuary is perfect, light and temperature controls are set and that everything runs smoothly on your special day.

We value all faith backgrounds and welcome your pastor to officiate, or you may ask to meet with our pastor, Rev. Laurie Manning.She will offer three counseling sessions and then two more to prepare your personal ceremony. You are also welcome to use our Music Director or bring in musicians of your choice.

Our facilities are ideal, our prices are reasonable and our restrictions are few.

comfort!

Skyline Church is truly a beautiful ceremony venue. The church met my desire to have an indoor ceremony with an outdoor feel--the entire back wall is comprised of floor to ceiling windows. I appreciated that we were not only able to use the sanctuary for the ceremony, but the lovely grounds to take pictures and have a mini outdoor reception after our ceremony and before our banquet. Skyline has a large gazebo where our string quartet played during the mini-reception and a large courtyard and a grassy area for guests to congregate after the ceremony. There are other nice touches: the church bell was rung to begin and end the ceremony; behind the church is a lovingly kept labyrinth nestled in a wooded area where our families were able to gather to take pictures.  
  
The church's wedding coordinator, Lee Rutter, is very responsive, professional, helpful, and kind. She met with me several times before the wedding and presided over the wedding rehearsal. It is clear that Lee, and other Skyline congregation members, truly care about the church and the grounds and work hard to keep it looking beautiful.

I will write a lengthier review later, but wanted to say that Lee is a pleasure to work with. The church is beautiful and has many different ammenities from a large changing room for both the men (with attached bathroom) and the women (detached bathroom), a zen garden, a gazebo, a bell for ringing, organ, is pet and petal friendly, and the view is so unique and beautiful. They only book one wedding per day so you are not rushed. The drive up to the church is beautiful and it takes you away from the city. I am so glad we got married here. Even our pastor who grew up on the street above the church had no idea how beautiful the view was from the santuary.

We held our ceremony at Skyline and it was a beautiful location! In fact our friends are still commenting on how gorgeous it was. I loved that they allowed us to bring in our own officiant. The coordinator there is a very sweet lady who was always available and extremely helpful. One small thing, hire your own AV coordinator to manage your music. Theirs seemed to have no idea what he was doing.

Our ceremony was held at Skyline Community Church. The setting was Beautiful! As a bride I could not ask for anything more perfect. I thought parking would be a problem but it turned out to not be the case. I loved the bride quarters, which was just across the way from the church. My photographer was able to take pre-wedding photos there as well. Overall a wonderful experience. I donated my draping to the church.

Great venue with awful service

I had my wedding at Skyline Community Church in March 2022. My partner and I chose the venue because we loved the beautiful space with that glass paneled wall, and it was close to where most of our friends and family lived. When we checked out the venue in 2021, the church event coordinator promised us it would fit up to 300 people easily, with easily accommodating parking, and we could bring our own refreshments and water bottles for afterwards. It seemed that all was well.   
  
But over the next few months, the coordinator became increasingly hard to track down. I would email her, then text her, then email the church help page, then wait a few days and receive a call telling me how I should just text her. She was very difficult to work with. For instance, when I texted her to confirm the final payment, she did not confirm the amount until the day before payment was due. I raced to the post office to send it in, and a week later she said it was actually going to be $350 more and she was sorry she didn't get back to me sooner because she was on vacation. I sent in a third check through USPS, but she claimed she couldn't find it and asked me, two days before the wedding, to get a cashier's check from the bank or pay a fee to use a credit card. I fought back, saying that she had confirmed the wrong number and that I had sent in everything on time, and telling me this information less than 24 hours before my rehearsal was unreasonable, and then she allowed me to pay with credit card without an additional fee.   
  
But the worst issue was that for my actual wedding weekend, she handed me off to two event coordinators for the church that I had never met before, and who were not on the same page about anything I had discussed with the original coordinator. When I arrived at the rehearsal (less than 24 hours before the wedding) they let me know that only 150 guests would be allowed in the church (we had 200 guests coming, as the original wedding coordinator had cleared that amount) and the other 50 guests would have to sit outside the church in the hot sun. When I told them this was not what was discussed, they said that it was in a contract I signed. I checked every contract I signed with them and there was NOTHING in there about a limit of 150 (in fact, the limit in the contract said 297.) We got the original event coordinator on speaker phone, and she started spouting off things I had NEVER discussed with her: that I had told her the wedding would only have 150 people anyway?! After about an hour of negotiating, they realized that they could not go against the contract they had signed with me and allowed us to set up chairs for my guests to sit inside, but this is NOT the kind of issue you want to have the day before your wedding.   
  
They also kept coming up to me (the bride) to stress how environmentally friendly they were as a church, and they were concerned that my plates would have a wax coating. I assured one of them this was not the case, and then the other one came up to me and asked me the same set of questions about the plates. I had a day-of coordinator and 6 bridesmaids trying to take questions for me and keep them away from me, but for some reason they all (the two coordinators and a third elderly lady who also worked at the church) thought it was appropriate to badger the bride with these questions. They also said that plastic water bottles would not be allowed, even though the original coordinator had approved them. Lastly, they said that 200 people would not be able to fit their cars in the parking lot space, and would have to park on the street, which was in direct contrast to what the original coordinator had promised - that 300 guests had no problem fitting in their lot. It seems this church has a lot of miscommunications it needs to work through before it will be ready to properly coordinate for another wedding.  
  
If you're planning to go with this venue in spite of this review, I would recommend getting EVERYTHING they promise you in writing, as they are quick to go back on their word and their communication is unreliable and infrequent until it's too late.
