Recommend The Copy Shop For All Your Needs! 

I was a large "to it yourself" bride who works in communication/marketing and has the ability to figure out how to make each element I wanted, but at some point I simply don't have time to do it all! The Copy Shop was wonderful to sit down with to look at options of save the dates, invitation suites, and programs. It was a fun process to gather ideas from their many ideas and designs. Their designer, Makenna was so patient as I designed part of the suite but she finished it out. They provided ideas on colors, designs, paper options, and were personal. When planning my wedding, I didn't want my suite to look like other weddings and they made sure it was classy and personalize to me, better than most online options. We even created fan programs for our outdoor wedding - they were such a hit! This is something we wouldn't have thought about without the Copy Shop! I think it is vital to support small business where you live, and the Copy Shop provided quality, competitive cost, unique designs quick turnaround and a great experience. I would recommend this to anyone in the area getting married!

Best printer in town for wedding materials

I got married NYE 2022 and the copy shop did the best job printing all of our stuff! We had a lot of last minute orders and they were so fast and efficient. I cannot imagine how we would have been without them. We even did our invites and thank you post cards with them.

Beautiful Invitations!

When we decided to get married, there was no decision-making as far as who to go with for invitations. I’ve worked with The Copy Shop on other projects and have ALWAYS been very happy with the work they do. Their selection and attention to detail is just Amaziing! And Amy is an absolute joy to work with. I Highly recommend The Copy Shop for your wedding invitations!

The PERFECT wedding invitations!

I used the Copy Shop for my save the dates and formal invitations. Both turned out so lovely. I received LOTS of compliments on our invitations. I’d highly recommend this place for anyone wanting beautiful invitations. Ask for Deb!

Excellent!

I worked with Deb to create our wedding invitations, RSVP cards, place cards, programs and thank you notes. Deb was wonderful! She was very responsive to my emails, listened to what we wanted and turned our vision into reality. Deb made sure everything was perfect and exactly what we wanted. I would highly recommend!

November 19 Wedding

We started working with The Copy Shop in May of 2022 before our November wedding. They were so kind, patient, and knowledgeable in their field. We started from scratch with invitations. This was a bit overwhelming! Amy and Deb helped me to decide on a style, font, and so on. They were patient with our many modifications and add-ons (bless you both!) I purchased, invitations, programs, thank you cards, menu cards, table numbers, cookie stickers, and a seating chart. I was so ecstatic with every piece!!! It was obvious that this company takes pride in their work. I will forever recommend The Copy Shop!!! Thank you all!!
