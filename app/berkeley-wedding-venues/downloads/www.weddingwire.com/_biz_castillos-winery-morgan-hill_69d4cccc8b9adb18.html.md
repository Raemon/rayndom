We spent two years looking for a place that had the feeling we were looking for in a wedding venue. While we didn’t want a traditional or cramped feel something that would lend a formal feel was important, and we had a budget to stay within!   
  
We visited and came back to Castillo’s because of their wine, their red’s are very good!   
  
We became members there because the Castillo family was so welcoming and personable to us.   
  
We decided to get married there because their outdoor venue is absolutely lovely, while still being intimate, and perfect for a wedding of 45 to 120 people, and our guest list of 98 was perfectly happy with lots of elbow room at the delightful location.   
  
One of the owners, RoniJo Castillo acted as our onsite coordinator for our two meetings leading up to the event, the rehearsal and on the day of the wedding. When there were questions, she was responsive and attentive to us, often giving us good direction. She and her team were top notch and she personally made our wedding as successful as it was due to her caring and interaction with us and our vendors, to ensure that the day came off without a hitch. She handled the set up of not only the dining portion, but the pre ceremony activities, wine tasting / cocktail hour for our guest while we were off taking pictures around the property, and transitions between all parts of the day.   
The other owner, Jess Castillo her husband, handled all the catering/cooking, leading a team in their outdoor kitchen for the event. Tri-tip, chicken, salads, pizza oven duties all onsite and supplying wine o’plenty made for a great “One stop shopping” venue for our wedding. The Castillo's showed attention and caring that I don't think can be found at other venues, because other venues aren't someones home, quite often it's just a location for an event. Looking back, I am sure that I wouldn't have gone anywhere else!  
  
We are already talking about having our five year anniversary party there.

Rude owner, poor service 

I have never been so offended by an experience. I have patroned this establishment prior and even bought the cds of the son and daughter. Today we returned for a bachelorette's for my younger sister. This experience has left a distasteful taste. They started with an awkward hiccup of a strange comparison of a light skinned person and sun to a wine. Mind you I'm black and light skinned, so I was not sure if this was a failed attempt in being humorous. We ordered a table full of tastings and 3 additional bottles. We asked for additional cups separately from our tasting glasses and were met with an attitude saying they only give one glass per customer. It was not disclosed to us that our glasses for the tasting and the separately purchased bottles were limited to the one. At this point we were already subjected to an unacceptable experience, so we asked if they could PLEASE* bring the check. The lady which I know is the mother/ owner responded "I'm not your slave, you can go to the front and pay for your check." Mind you nothing merited the response. The owner was continuing to speak rudely when she was met by a response that she deserved by my mother about how to speak to young women with respect. How do you serve a table but not bring the check? Again I'm black, do not compare grabbing a bill for us to pay your personal business to slavery. This experience was insensitive and gross. You get paid for your services. We bought 3 bottles and a table of tastings. We were treated as if we were an unruly bachelorette team when everyone in the party is sober, educated and civilized unlike the pre judgmental people that work here. I do not recommend this place. They came off elitist and if a team of beautiful women wear matching shirts offends you, deny service rather than give them the worst experience you can manage. She upset and offended the bride and bridal party. Who says my service is a reflection to you? That's 1 not true, we weren't rude and 2 unprofessional, this is a business. I hope the owner reads this and reflects because her behavior was unacceptable.

Rude owner

WEDDING SHOPPERS BEWARE!   
We went here to scout for our wedding venue. The tasting Room Sommelier said we can tour around ourselves and they had a venue for that purpose beside the tasting room. We walked out of the tasting room and encountered a big, unleashed dog barking and staring at us, which felt very unwelcoming and we feared being bitten or charged at. Upon finishing the tour we met the owner who seemed very upset that we walked around the common spaces. Phrases like “I do not like that” and “this is my house” but we never walked into the areas that had private signs. He was incredibly rude to my partner and I. When we told him we were looking at places to host our wedding, and without more context about timeline, he replied that they dont do those “one year out” type of weddings because they can’t commit, but they will entertain weddings with three week notice…  
  
On our way out, the Sommelier asked us about the tour - it seems like there is a misunderstanding about the wedding service they are willing to provide…   
  
This unfortunate encounter left a very sour taste in our mouths. Regardless that the property is beautiful, we will not be conducting any business with this location.
