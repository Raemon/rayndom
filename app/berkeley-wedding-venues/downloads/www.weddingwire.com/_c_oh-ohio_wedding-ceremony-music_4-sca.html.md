Alexandre Marr played beautifully at our wedding in June! For the ceremony he collaborated with violinist Jahna Stanton and cellist Brendon Phelps. They prepared beautiful gathering music and played my chosen selections for processional and postlude. As a fellow classical pianist, Alexandre made sure all the selections were approved by me first, which I really appreciated. He was very flexible and easy to communicate with from the beginning, and even pre-ceremony as the coordinator and I were giving him updates about when the bridal party was ready to start walking down. He was very flexible and professional. He also played during the cocktail hour with Miss Stanton, and our guests were delighted to hear the live music as they waited for the dinner to start. I highly recommend Alexandre Marr - he has a wide range of repertoire of different styles and genres, he is well connected with the musical community in the greater Cleveland area, easy to collaborate and work with, and his playing is of the highest quality.

I absolutely recommend the Silver & Strings Trio. They were immediately responsive, extremely helpful, and completely willing to provide exactly what we wanted. Their professionalism and obvious experience made it so easy on our end. Importantly, the trio is uniquely suited to play ceremony music, with masterly control of their instruments.

Wow. Tiffany was absolutely incredible to work with for our wedding and a true professional every step of the way. She was super responsive and clear on email with us, showed up early and completely prepared, and is an amazing musician. Everyone in our crowd loved the harp and violin duo and we had several musicians who attended the wedding and commented on how talented they were. They made the ceremony incredibly special and we cannot recommend them enough. 10/10 decision to have them as part of our day.

Holly was so sweet & accommodating from the first time that we contacted her. My daughter’s wedding was outdoors @ Ault Park & Lyrica set up in the Rose Garden easily & without issue. The music during the ceremony was so beautiful & exactly what my daughter & her fiancé had hoped for. So beautiful & elegant! Following the ceremony, Lyrica continued to play as our guests made their way up to cocktail hour in the Pavilion. Many of our guests commented on how much they loved the music. We were beyond satisfied with Lyrica & would highly recommend them to anyone planning their wedding!

I just got married over this past weekend, and I can not recommend Celestial Strings enough! They are truly amazing, talented, and beautiful people. We got so many compliments from our guests, and they truly set the tone for our big special day. We would love to have them again and are thrilled that we chose them.

We had a violin and cello for our wedding ceremony and the music was lovely. Our guests are still giving compliments! The group is excellent at working with the flow of the ceremony. They were very helpful in selecting music and figuring our the details prior to the big day. Also, they will help find sheet music for any specific requests. We were very happy with our choice and highly recommend them if you're looking to have string musicians at an event!
