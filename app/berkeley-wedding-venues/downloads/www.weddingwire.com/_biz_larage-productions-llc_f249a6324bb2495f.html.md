#####  Pierre LaRage 

Owner 

__4 years in business

__We speak English

__Just me

South Lake Tahoe is the home venue of LaRage Productions, LLC, a skilled wedding musician with the expertise to make your long-awaited event truly unforgettable. Inspired by the region's beauty, my arrangements of cello and guitar are a tribute to the sweeping majestic views. You'll hear the soaring mountains and the ebb and flow of time in each piece. I'm a trained classical cellist, and a mesmerizing fingerstyle acoustic guitar compounds my sound. I incorporate soul, classical music, rock, and country elements into my performances and can tailor the vibe, tone, and genre to your taste.

**Services Offered**

Always willing to travel, I am a pilot, athlete, and avid outdoor enthusiast who can accommodate unique and remote venues. That's what I love to do! Locations have included the peaks of Taos, the rolling meadows of Mt. Baker, and the banks and coves of the Colorado River. Wedding parties are responsible for travel expenses, including logistics, lodging, and meals, but I am ready to participate actively!

LaRage Productions, LLC offers a comprehensive wedding package with:

  * A Bose PA system and microphone for the ceremony and reception
  * A custom instrumental arrangement for the ceremony or an arrangement of your favorite songs or classical pieces
  * A preapproved set list for the wedding reception and/or luncheon/dinner for up to 3 hours

Wedding (Cello)

Peter was awesome, he was extremely communicative with me through the whole planning process of my wedding.   
My wedding was in Reno but I live in Dallas so the fact that all the music sampling and recordings that he did was only sent through email, Peter made it so easy and simply and stress free!!   
He did an outstanding job at my wedding and I would highly recommend him to anyone that needs an amazing musician for party, weddings, anniversaries or even engagement party’s!!   
Thankyou Peter!!!

Let music move you.

My husband and i are so happy we went with live music for our ceremony. We had so much positive comments from our guest on how lovely it was to be able to hear music while waiting. Also for the wedding party to walk to. Peter is an amazing addition to any event and i was beyond blown away by this artist. We recommend for any wedding or event!   
Thank you Peter.

Outstanding Wedding Performance!

Pierre was an absolute pleasure to work with for our November Lake Tahoe wedding. He played both cello and guitar for the ceremony and our hour-long reception, and his music truly elevated the entire day. Throughout the planning process, he was incredibly responsive and receptive to our ideas—quick to text back, flexible with adjustments, and thoughtful in helping us refine the ceremony selections.  
He even accommodated a last-minute request to add a unique song for my wife’s walk down the aisle, and it turned out absolutely beautiful. For the cocktail hour, he created a playlist that matched our music preferences perfectly, capturing exactly the vibe we were hoping for. He also offered creative suggestions throughout and curated music that fit the venue and atmosphere seamlessly.  
We couldn’t recommend Pierre more highly to anyone looking for a talented and professional musician for their wedding or special event!

Unique and Personalized Music

Peter was ready for anything. Cover Bel Biv Devoe’s Poison for the grand entrance, check. Lovely classical while guests sit in chairs waiting, done. A one of a kind rendition of pink pony club for the procession, magical. A great list of tahoe perfect songs for the reception, of course. Peter worked with out low key minimally coordinated event with such high level skills that it was clear he could work with any budget and any wedding format. He is also seriously talented. Guitar and cello! And singing! Amazing. If you want someone who is ready to make your day unique and special while also keeping it calm and not stressful, look no further.

Unforgettable experience for our engagement proposal

I approached Pierre with the idea of creating a surprise engagement proposal for my now fiancée, and he exceeded all expectations. Not only was he responsive and supportive, but he was also genuinely enthusiastic about bringing the vision to life. This wasn’t an easy setup—he hiked up to Cave Rock with all his equipment and instruments, yet he arrived early and was fully prepared with his cello by the time we got there. The result was a magical moment we will cherish forever. Pierre is incredibly talented, professional, and warm. I highly recommend his services and would absolutely work with him again in the future.   
Thank you, Pierre!

Mountain top wedding

We can't thank Peter enough for making our wedding ceremony unforgettable! Not only did he fly in with his cello to perform on the mountain at Taos Ski Velley, but he went above and beyond in every way. He helped us set up for the ceremony, ensuring everything was perfect despite the unique and difficult location for the ceremony.  
His music selection was absolutely spot-on—he chose pieces that perfectly captured the magic and intimacy of the moment without any input from us.   
.   
Peter brought so much heart and stoke to the day, and his performance was a highlight that our guests still rave about. If you're lucky enough to have him play at your event, you're in for something truly special. Thank you, Peter, for making our day so extraordinary!

Peter was amazing!

Kind, thoughtful, talented. Peter was a special edition to our wedding. He played the cello for my entrance and then at the reception a mixture of guitar and cello. He was a pleasure to work with.
