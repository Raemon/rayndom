This place was amazing for our July wedding!

My fiance and I were married last month at Casa and it was amazing! Virginia and Kara, and all of the staff were amazing since the moment we first went to tour the venue about 8 months before our big date. They were all so extremely professional, kind, responsive and very helpful in our planning throughout. Casa offers everything included, or you can further personalize. We chose to use everything that is provided (white linens, chairs, china, etc). We were not disappointed. Everything looked so elegant. And the food - the food was amazing. All of our guests raved about how delicious the food was (we offered our guests a choice of chicken gruyere as well as the filet mignon). They also accommodated several people with multiple allergies (we were told by the guests that the chef came out and directly spoke with them to walk through the ingredients). This and other personal touches throughout the night helped make our night so memorable. It is a beautiful venue with lots of options! I was very concerned at first on how such a large space could accommodate my relatively small wedding of 93 people. But it worked perfect! We chose to have an ivory curtain that blocked off the cocktail hour inside, but it would have been fine without. The vineyards were perfect for sunset photos. We really can't say enough good things about this place. We highly recommend having your wedding here especially if (like us) you want/need the extra help in planning your day. They treated us wonderfully. We loved how we were able to enjoy cocktail hour while taking photos. There were two servers that accompanied us during pictures with a cart food of food and drinks - such an awesome touch! Having a day- of coordinator was another great part of Casa's wedding package. We loved how we were just able to show up and enjoy our wedding! The staff made it about as stress free as a wedding could possibly be. Our wedding was on a Thursday evening which offers a discounted rate - it was a fantastic value for what we got. We highly recommend Casa!

My Daughter’s 18th Bday

-Casa real exceeded all our expectations and even beyond! Im so glad that we chose Casa Real as the venue for our daughter’s 18th birthday last February 19, 2024. Their staff were very professional, kind and helpful from our initial inquiry, first meeting with Jenny, booking the venue, payments, food tasting, planning, and the day of the event. Kara was so amazing. She was the contact person after we have booked the venue from initial to final payments, schedule of food tasting and all our other inquiries. She never got tired of answering all our questions and making things happen for us. We could not asked for a better coordinator than Carly. She was simply the BEST! From planning up to the day of the event she worked so hard to make that day the best birthday ever for our daughter. She coordinated not only with us but also with our different vendors. On the day of the event, she made sure they got all the details from centerpiece, table set up, seating plan, bows on each chair, display of our daughter’s awards and artworks that we have provided were all in its perfect place. She even provided snacks and drinks at the suite where me and my daughter had our make up done and changed. Our 200 plus guests were so amazed by how beautiful and big the venue was and the set-up. It would have been much nicer if it was not raining and probably during summer time when all the vines have all grown back again. They were also impressed with the food from the appetizers, salad to main entree as well as the service. The salad was so good, the herb crusted cod and NY steak was cooked perfectly and delicious. The open bar was superb. Our guests were raving about how efficient and good were all the bartenders. Their system of noting the guests seating arrangement, food choices and guests’ allergies were efficient and organized. Another thing I love about them was that they allowed us to have my daughter’s favorite cake and desserts as well as Boba drinks from our own vendors. They also allowed us to provide our own bowls of instant ramen, spoons and chopsticks, as our after-party snacks which was another favorite of my daughter. My only regret was not extending the party time. Our guests were having so much fun they wish there was more time to dance and enjoy the after party snacks.

Great Venue, Great Customer Service

I have been fortunate to make my living as a professional photographer for over 3 decades, worked at countless venues all over the nation. Now base in Livermore CA, I feel extreme fortunate to be able to work at Casa Real. Casa Real hands down is one of the best wedding/event venues. The staff is top notch, truly focused on their clients and making the wedding/event run seamlessly! As a wedding/event photographer managing time, details, individuals, while still being creative is the goal at every wedding and event. This can be a challenge at times. One of the things that allows me to do my job more efficiently is have a supporting staff around me. The staff at Casa Real definitely fits this description! I know that when I have a wedding/event at Casa Real I am going to be working with the best! If you are considering wedding/event venues put Casa Real on top of your list. Beautiful venue, amazing food, and a staff that knows the meaning of great customer service!

Amazing Wedding Experience

This venue made my summer wedding an absolute dream. The staff are incredibly thorough and supportive, as they made me feel taken care of and special on the day of the wedding. They helped to get all of the little details taken care of seamlessly, and I would highly recommend this venue for anyone looking for a large space with beautiful views and high-end customer service. Our wedding coordinator, August, was also a huge contributor to making the day so incredible for us because of her calm, warm energy and professional demeanor.

Absolutely Amazing!

The Casa Real staff, Kara, and Alyssa are all amazing! All the guests were raving about how great the service was. From the beginning to end, the experience was wonderful and they answered all our emails so quickly. On the day of, the staff made sure my husband and I had water and left a platter of food in the bridal suite for us. Without our coordinator, Alyssa, I don’t know what we would have done. Everything ran so smoothly and even better than expected. I can’t wait to come back again and attend a wedding here as a guest!

Stunning Venue and Team of Pros

Casa Real made all of our wedding dreams come true! It is a challenge to write a review that is not pages long, because there are so many amazing things to say about the Casa Real office team, event planning team, day-of staff, venue, food…. From the first day we toured the property, my parents and husband and I were sold on this venue. It was apparent right away that the team is full of experts who know about every detail that goes in to a wedding, and if you don’t have the answer they are ready to guide you with options and recommendations. We felt like we were in such great hands with Kara and Antonella during the planning phase, and I cannot give high enough praise for Kelsea. Kelsea was our day-of coordinator, and all of my wedding party and family agreed she was a STAR throughout the day. She was so sweet and fun with our wedding party during the rehearsal, and everyone felt so comfortable with her on the day of the wedding. She was so good at checking in with us and our parents throughout the night. We did not hire a wedding planner, but we always felt like we had one with Casa running point. The day of our wedding ran so smoothly and we even were ahead of schedule at some points. Our day felt fun and exciting and EASY, and I attribute all of that to Casa’s expert team handling everything in the background.  
  
Casa’s preferred vendor list is top-notch and well curated so that they can recommend the best vendors in the area who are also all well-acquainted with each other. Every vendor we worked with was so complimentary of Casa Real and the work they do, and we couldn’t agree more. In addition to the impeccably appointed property (the foyer, sun garden, amber room, and grand salon are stunning even without wedding decor), one other standout from our wedding is easily the FOOD. From the snacks in the bridal suite, to the cocktail hour appetizers, to the generous and delicious entrees, to our late night donuts and french fries, to the well-stocked (and beautiful) bar, I was so proud that all of our wedding food was DELICIOUS. (One note in particular: we had multiple guests tell us this was by far the best vegetarian meal they had ever had at any wedding!) Everything about Casa Real deserves five stars - I am so thankful to their whole team!

Autumn Wedding at Casa Real magical!

11/10/22 Autumn wedding at CASA REAL was spectacular! The vineyards were highlighted with brilliant colors, which enhanced our photos! More importantly, the VENUE was top notice, starting with @karaandrews and @alyssastewart, who were willing to listen to and make specific requests happen! the transition from the Amber room to the ballroom was seamless never saw any movement from the staff. It just happened behind the scenes. Now, regarding the MENU, the CHEFS and the staff hit it out of the park! Our guests, a week later, are still calling to tell us how great each food choice was. From the appetizers to the display tables, main entree, late-night snacks, and our Donut Flambee bar!   
  
HIGHLY recommend Casa Real @beetscatering for your next event, no matter the occasion. Mother of the bride, Lois

The BEST venue & team, THANK YOU!!!

If you are looking for a venue for your dream wedding then you should definitely check out Casa Real! They made sure everything ran smoothly and was always there for us to answer and help us with the million questions we had.  
They made sure the wedding had everything we wanted from tons of delious food to a last minute tea cermony and even snowballs! The venue was breathtakingly beutiful on its own, which helped us with saving on decorations.  
The team was very helpful throughout the planning stages and the event itself to make sure everything ran smoothly and on time and they even made sure we got a chance to try all the food! They made sure we were well fed throughout from a champagne cart to platters of each item during our cocktail hour. We even had a full spread of apps and each of our specialty drinks ready for us at our sweetheart table!  
They even have an in house bakery that made our delious cakes. We wanted to make sure everyone had a slice of cake at our wedding and the bakery was able to help us make custom centerpiece cakes for each table and also provided us with a wonderful spread for our dessert bar!   
It was a magical day that we will never forget and it was all thanks to the great team at casa real. Special thanks to Genevieve, Kara and team for helping make sure everything ran smoothly from the beginning to end, THANK YOU for helping us with our dream wedding!!!
