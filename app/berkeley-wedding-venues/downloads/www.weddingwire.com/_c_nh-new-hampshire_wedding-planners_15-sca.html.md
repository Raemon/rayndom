We are so glad that we hired Jamie to be our day of coordinator and would highly recommend her to anyone looking to be stress free on their wedding day. We had previously hired a different DOC who had to drop out due to personal health problems. Jamie came recommended to us through our florist who had worked with her before. From our first meeting with Jamie, she instilled a confidence in us that we had never felt with our previous hire. She is a great communicator and clearly laid out what responsibilities she would be taking on. She had a series of meetings with us leading up to the wedding, handled vendor communication in the final week before the event, and put together a timeline based on our preferences and vendor preferences. We also hired her to do the styling for our tables which turned out exactly the way we had envisioned. On the day of the wedding, Jamie and her team took care of executing the timeline and ensured the set up was done to our specifications. We had a small snafu where I had forgotten to get pens for the guestbook and she took care of it for us. I am sure there were other areas where the event did not go according to plan, but Jamie and her team took care of them all. My husband and I both agree that we had a perfect wedding!

Kendall was an absolute dream to work with. She didn't just meet our expectations; she far exceeded them by taking our vision (including my crazy vision of disco balls and rattan lamps) and bringing it to life beautifully. I cannot recommend her enough. From organizing rehearsal day to literally climbing ladders to hang our crazy vision of disco balls and rattan lamps, she does it all. I did not have to worry about a single thing on my wedding day—decor was perfect, the bridal party was on time, and she kept me sane by handling every single question from guests and our bridal/groomsmen. I literally did not have to worry about a single thing on my wedding day. Kendall is the sweetest woman and so easy to talk to. When I first inquired, she immediately helped me organize my vision and decor (a lifesaver for my ADHD brain!) and provided the steps and spreadsheets to stay organized during the planning process. She is worth every penny and more. I cannot recommend her enough!

Working with Mali was a game changer for our wedding day! When we started working together, she outlined our priorities and helped make sure we were kept on track by giving us tasks each week. It was a huge help for us to know what we needed to work on, and when. She also handled all vendor conversations leading up to the wedding and it totally streamlined everything - and everyone loved working with her! On the day of, she made sure everything ran smoothly and that we didn't have to think of anything other than having the best day. I never had to worry about anything on our wedding day, and it truly changed everything. She was organized, professional, and also made sure we had everything we needed throughout the entire day. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a planner to ensure the day goes perfectly!

We couldn't have been happier with Jen!! We had the daunting task of planning a wedding in less than 5 months but Jen made it all possible (and as stress-free as possible) through her expertise, helpful tools, and amazing vendor recommendations for both our welcome party and wedding. She also gave helpful recommendations on decor to match our venue and vision. On our wedding day, her calm and professional demeanor and attention to detail allowed my husband and I to fully enjoy the day without worrying about anything. Our wedding day went so smoothly and turned out more beautiful than we could have imagined. Thank you Jen for bringing our wedding dreams to life!

Nicole is amazing! We live in Hanover and had our wedding here, and it was such a gift to work with someone local who personally knew many of our vendors. We hosted a four-day wedding with over 200 guests, 12 locations, and even more vendors. Our schedule was packed with meals, activities, and events – and everything ran seamlessly. Of course, all credit goes to Nicole! She built an incredibly detailed timeline, assembled a fantastic team, coordinated with all of our vendors, and was always available to answer questions from guests. Because of Nicole, we were able to simply show up, relax, and actually *enjoy* our own wedding. Many of our guests have since mentioned Nicole by name, remarking on how steady, positive, and impressive she was at every event. We absolutely loved working with Nicole and would recommend her wholeheartedly to anyone planning a wedding. She is experienced, detail-oriented, and a true joy to be around.

What can I say. Mandy made our day so so SPECIAL! And easyyyyy! I really cannot say enough about her professionalism, friendliness, time management and accessibility. She is exactly what you need for any wedding. Most venues have a wedding “coordinator” but they are simply the booking and setup agent. If you want to feel like every base is being covered and every need is being met, you need Mandy from Breathe Easy Events. She thought of so many things I didn’t even know I would have to think of, but also calmly reassured me in times of stress. She always managed to make herself available for in-person meetings and on the wedding day itself, she was nothing short of super woman. 10/10 professional. 11/10 person. Do yourself a favor and book Breathe Easy

Our wedding was absolutely perfect, and it's all thanks to Laurie! From the moment we met, we knew she was the right person for the job. Her incredible organization and meticulous attention to detail were evident throughout the entire planning process. She seamlessly navigated any challenges and always was the most professional. Her guidance and expertise allowed us to relax and truly enjoy our special day. We highly recommend Laurie to any couple planning their wedding. She is a true professional and a joy to work with.

Angela came recommended to us from our very close friends and she did not disappoint. We opted for the full planning and design package which was great because she covered literally every base for us. Wedding planning was daunting at first, but Angela made it very easy. You can't avoid the one million decisions, but she did a great job of ushering us through the process, staying on top of critical deadlines, and listening to our vision. Our special day turned out completely beautiful and went off without a hitch! We highly recommend Angela and co!

We hired Otto Events for day-of coordination for our wedding, and it was hands-down one of the best decisions we made. Jenn brought a sense of calm, organization, and confidence that allowed us to fully enjoy our day without stress. The team was incredibly attentive, proactive, and detail-oriented. They made sure every vendor was on the same page, kept the timeline running smoothly, and handled unexpected hiccups before we even had a chance to notice them. Their communication leading up to the wedding was clear and reassuring, and on the actual day, they were everywhere they needed to be—always one step ahead. Because of Otto Events, we were able to relax, be present, and soak in every moment. Our families and wedding party also repeatedly commented on how seamless and well-coordinated everything felt. If you’re looking for a day-of coordinator who is professional, reliable, and truly committed to making your wedding perfect, Otto Events is the one. We can’t recommend them highly enough!
