Music for the moment is a company that makes your special day the most amazing one. Karen is always open for a phone call to work out any song details and gives the best advice. She went above and beyond for my husband and I to learn Hindi songs to play on the violin. When it came to our wedding day the violin version of every song sounded so beautiful. I would highly recommend using music for the moment!!

The Rose Trio was the perfect addition to our garden ceremony. We received countless compliments on our ceremony and truly owe that to the Rose Trio. The wedding music selection was beautiful and fun. Our guests loved it and it was a perfect way to start the celebration. Thank you Rose Trio for all your help throughout the wedding process - you made it such a breeze.

Mike was absolutely amazing! He played during our ceremony and cocktail hour and even stayed a little longer at no extra cost when he realized we didn’t have other music lined up. He was such a pleasure to work with very professional, kind, and incredibly talented. His music added so much warmth and elegance to our wedding, and our guests loved him. Truly the best violinist we could have chosen! Highly recommend him to any couple looking for someone who goes above and beyond

We loved everything Dolce DaVita Strings had to offer. From the planning process to the day of the wedding, Grace and her team were on top of everything, guests loved their mixed playlist of fun pop songs and some classical staples. It made our wedding day extra special.

Our wedding violinist Joseph was absolutely incredible. From the moment he started playing, he set the perfect romantic tone for the evening. The music was beautiful, emotional, and flawlessly performed—it truly elevated the entire atmosphere of our wedding. Guests would not stop complimenting him throughout the night, and many said the violin was one of their favorite parts of the celebration. His talent, professionalism, and ability to read the room made the night feel magical and unforgettable. We couldn’t have asked for a better musician to be part of such a special day. If you’re looking for someone who will add elegance, romance, and lasting memories to your event, we highly recommend Joseph.

Sweet Harmony did a fabulous job at our wedding. We had a cellist (Elina) and violinist (Nancie) duo who brought just the right amount of pizzazz and fun—in a classy way—to our ceremony and cocktail hour. Not only did they answer all of my (probably annoying) questions leading up too our big day in a timely manner, but they played beautifully and our guests loved that they played some fun, modern songs they could actually recognize (Taylor Swift, Maroon 5, etc.) Highly recommend! Worth every (reasonable) penny.

Party of Three recently played at my Christmas wedding and I could not have been more thrilled. The music was absolutely incredible.
