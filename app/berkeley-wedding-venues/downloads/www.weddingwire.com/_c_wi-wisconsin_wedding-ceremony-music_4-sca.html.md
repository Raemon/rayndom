Rodney was there for us when we needed sound and music for our wedding. We had our wedding at a local park and the reception at the local community hall. He was there early and had all the sound and microphones ready before the guests arrived. He was very professional and personable. The best thing was that we did not have to think about our sound or music at all for our wedding day. Rodney took care of it! He did all the set up and take down and was ready at the reception hall before we arrived. We did not have any issues with music or sound for our whole wedding. Rodney was someone we could depend on and did a top notch job for our most special day. We would highly recommend Rodney!

We recently had the pleasure of working with Anna Marie for a wedding we were coordinating, and we couldn’t be more impressed! Her communication throughout the planning process was excellent, and she even attended the ceremony rehearsal to ensure the timing of her songs was perfect. Anna Marie went above and beyond to collaborate with our clients, making sure the music matched their vision exactly. On the wedding day, her performance was nothing short of amazing. Her voice was absolutely incredible, and she truly knocked it out of the park! We will definitely be recommending Anna Marie to our future wedding clients. She’s a true professional and an exceptional musician!

It was such a joy working with Fine Music (Manuel + Iuliia) for Erin & John’s wedding! Their team was incredibly professional, organized, and so talented. The live music during the ceremony and cocktail hour created the perfect atmosphere! It was elegant, romantic, and beautifully done. Fine Music knows how to set the tone for every part of the day. I highly recommend them to any couple looking for exceptional live entertainment! I would absolutely love to work with them again!

Phil is seriously a hidden gem! Right from the get-go he was knowledgeable, helpful, and all-around easy to work with! He responded to emails timely and never left me hanging. I actually saw him perform before I booked him just to make sure he was what I was looking for and he is an excellent musician. After I saw him play, I booked him that night! The week before the wedding, Phil called me so we could go over all the details and square away what song were to be played and not played. I booked Phil to do my whole wedding day of music, so he played guitar and sang for the ceremony and cocktail hour (along with one of his violinist friends) and DJed for the reception. Since he has worked so many weddings before he knew what questions to ask me and knew what to point out in my timeline. Phil learned some songs for the ceremony and even sang/played our first dance song! The music was so magical for the ceremony, I was drawn out of the moment during my ceremony just for a second because the music was so surreal. Then at the cocktail hour, they played more music, and everyone said it felt just like a cozy pub (we had a hobbit-themed wedding, so this was perfect!) Then when he was DJing he played great music that we as a couple wanted to hear but also read the crowd and played what they responded well to. As a musician, he is a very talented and hardworking virtuoso. As a professional, he is kind, thoughtful, funny, and an excellent person to work with. If you want a little more personal touch to your wedding, hire Phil Norby!

The musicians that played were amazing. I had always wanted live musicians to play a specific song for ceremony and it was beautiful. Communication was amazing and the pricing was perfect

Florence Strings played for our wedding ceremony, and we could not have been happier with the experience! From the very beginning they were incredibly professional, responsive, and easy to work with. They arrived early on the wedding day and made sure to confirm all details with our day-of coordinator, which gave us complete peace of mind. Their musicianship was exceptional—the pre-ceremony music created a warm, elegant atmosphere, and the ceremony performance itself was absolutely stunning. Many of our guests commented on how beautiful the music was and how perfectly it set the tone for our day. We truly appreciated their professionalism, attentiveness, and artistry. If you’re considering live strings for your wedding or special event, we highly recommend Florence Strings!

We thoroughly enjoyed working with Milwaukee String Quartet for our wedding at the Grain Exchange. They worked with us to choose our music and they were incredibly flexible with our choices. They were easy to work with, responsive, and they honestly helped to make our ceremony and cocktail hour special.

We had The Wisconsin String Quartet for our ceremony music and they did a great job. We had an outdoor wedding in the gardens and their music was perfect for the space. Aaron contacted us several times to make sure that he had the selections and the time and venue correct and was there playing for our guests when the gates opened. They even accommodated our best man who really wanted them to play "Deep in the Heart of Texas" which you can imagine is neither a tradition wedding song nor something a string Quartet plays in a regular basis. They ad-libed a few bars and our best man was thrilled! They were a great addition to our wedding!

They're amazing ceremony musicians--extremely professional, and they did a wonderful job helping keep the pace of our ceremony and taking cues from our officiant. Having them really elevated the feel of our ceremony.
