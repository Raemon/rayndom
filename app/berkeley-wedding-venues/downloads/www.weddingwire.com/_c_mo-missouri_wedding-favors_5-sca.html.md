I can’t say enough good things about Everlasting Bloom Co. They turned my wedding bouquet into the most stunning resin keepsake, and the quality truly blew me away. Every flower was beautifully preserved, and you can tell it was made with care and attention to detail. The ordering process was so easy and they kept me updated every step of the way. This piece means so much to me, and I will cherish it for the rest of my life! Highly recommend!

but I'm a fan of the wedding dress from Royce bridal! The fabric is comfortable and breathable, and the style is versatile. It's suitable for both outdoor and indoor weddings. I highly recommend it!

Mr. Candy Wrapper provides excellent customer service. Every question that I had regarding my favor tags and labels was answered in a timely manner (usually within minutes) and completely. I was able to provide feedback on my proofs and was able to get what I wanted in excellent time and at a wonderful price.

This was one of my most favorite parts of my wedding! We had Deb and her team be apart of our cocktail hour and draw guest while they were getting settled! And it acted like a great gift too! We also ask Deb if she could do coloring sheets of us for the kids at the wedding and she knocked it out of park!

Aimee O'Boyle is a class act. She is not only amazingly talented, but she runs her business with the utmost professionalism and integrity. I had Aimee design my wedding invitations (5 piece suite) and every proof she designed was so beautiful (and I'm a wedding planner myself, so I've seen wedding invitations galore). She gave me such gorgeous options, that it was hard to pick which ones I wanted to use. She understands wedding deadlines and prioritizes accordingly. I was so thrilled with the invitation suite she designed and couldn't wait to have them printed. When I went to have them printed, the printer pushed back and sent over a slew of modifications. Basically every card now has to be redesigned. While I never stress about anything wedding related, I am feeling a bit anxious. Aimee has taken this situation under her wings and has made me her "only client" until we can get this printed--something that means the world to me. She has to redesign every piece so they can be printed in time. She is a SAINT and has not complained once. In fact, her calm and efficient ways have put me at ease. If I could give her 10 stars, I would. Top notch graphic designer, amazing positive attitude and unparalleled service. I cannot recommend her enough!!
