A Thyme to Cook was such a great partner throughout our wedding planning process and on the day itself. They were incredibly communicative leading up to our wedding on 9.13.25 at Eolia Mansion, which made everything feel organized and stress-free. Our tasting was amazing, and when we shared feedback, they made adjustments right away. It really felt like they wanted to get everything just right. On the wedding day, their team truly helped the day flow. Even when we ran into hiccups with our transportation company, they stayed calm and made sure everything continued to run smoothly behind the scenes. The setup was efficient and well executed, and the food and drinks were a huge hit. Our guests are still raving about the menu, passed appetizers, and desserts. Overall, we had a great experience working with A Thyme to Cook and would absolutely recommend them to anyone looking for a caterer and day-of coordination team who helps bring everything together.

I couldn’t recommend working with Kara at Valencia Social Events more! The charcuterie cart was the perfect eclectic touch to my bridal shower — it was a gorgeous, high quality piece that everyone loved. Kara was so lovely to work with and I look forward to using her for events I host in the future!

Z Catering catered our wedding and we are very happy with that decision. Everything went flawlessly and tasted amazing. Many of our guests even came up to us saying how it was the best wedding food they ever had!

Spice Catering was referred by my vendor of choice so I knew they would not disappoint, but they kicked it out of the park! Reginal Mueller who was my contact was responsive, accessible, coordinating with the other vendors. The staff on the day felt like old friends for the personable and yet professional making my event a wonderful success!

We hosted a wedding on 10-10-25 at The Mountain Room at Mt. Southington --- working with Janalynne at Carmela Marie was so easy -- like working with your favorite cousin! She was so professional and helpful and very flexible. Best of all, EVERYONE commented on how excellent the food was --- from appetizers to filet mignon, everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. We would highly recommend working with Carmela Marie catering!

The venue my daughter selected for her wedding listed Emily's Catering Group as a preferred vendor. From the initial inquiry request, it became clear that Emily's Catering Group is responsive, professional, and thorough. Rick answered our request for information immediately and we were able to schedule a tasting at their showroom where we met Rick and Cheryl, tasted salad, entree, and dessert options, and received a comprehensive list of menu options and a transparent pricing estimate. Cheryl was terrific in the months leading up to the wedding checking in, answering any questions we had, and ensuring that they were well prepared for the big day. She is so friendly and knowledgeable and put us all at ease. They were in contact with our venue directly to coordinate all of the details and, on the day of the wedding, we did not have to think or worry about anything--all the details were executed perfectly. From a water, iced tea, and popcorn welcome table station before the ceremony to a full array of stationary charcuterie and passed appetizers during the cocktail hour, followed by a full sit down dinner with salad, bread, and choice entrees, and finally a ceremonial wedding cake and mini dessert table spread, all of the food was fantastic--presentation was great and all tasted delicious. The day of staff was professional and service was excellent. We are grateful to everyone at Emily's Catering Group for helping to make my daughter and son-in-law's wedding so special and memorable.

Our caterer was honestly a dream. The food was delicious, the team was fun to work with, and they made everything feel easy. Guests kept coming up to us saying “who is the caterer?" If you want great food without any stress, these are your people.

I don’t even know where to begin with Riverhouse Catering. I truly cannot say enough good things about them. I didn’t hire an event coordinator, and they completely stepped into that role on top of being our full-service caterer and bar. Noora helped me plan and coordinate details for almost two years, and her guidance and organization were invaluable. I was even able to make changes to numbers leading up to the day with no issues. On the wedding day, their entire team absolutely blew me away. They handled every detail seamlessly — even making the call on our ceremony location due to weather, waiting until the very last minute to give us the best possible outcome. Their professionalism, care, and experience are unmatched. And of course, the food — incredible. Guests are still talking about the warm short rib meal! Riverhouse made our day so special, and I’m endlessly grateful for their dedication and expertise.

We hired this company to cater our wedding last summer, and they went above and beyond in every possible way. From the moment the first hand-passed hors d’oeuvres came out, our guests were raving—and they didn’t stop all night! Everything was beautifully presented, perfectly seasoned, and incredibly fresh. The buffet was equally impressive. There was a fantastic variety of options, and every dish was delicious. Guests kept coming up to us saying it was the best wedding food they’d ever had, and we couldn’t agree more. Beyond the food itself, the staff were professional, friendly, and so attentive. They made sure everything ran smoothly and allowed us to truly relax and enjoy our day. We’re so grateful to have had them as part of our wedding. If you want exceptional food and service, look no further. Highly recommend! — Stephanie Dix
