Blue Mountain Resort is a multi-purpose wedding venue located upon the slopes of the Pocono Mountains in Palmerton, Pennsylvania. The family-owned location was opened on the 22nd of December, 1977 and has since established itself as a hallmark of wedding venues in Pennsylvania. The resort caters to couples who have always dreamt of mountainous scenery combined with a refined atmosphere and sense of sophistication.

**Facilities and Capacity**

Blue Mountain Resort provides couples with a scenic outdoor location to host their momentous ceremony and two elegant indoor event spaces to choose from. Couples can make their grand entrance down the garden path, toward the lush green lawns that are fringed by towering pine forests. Say “I do” beneath the quaint pergola that looks out over the breathtaking valley below. The Vista Ballroom features a 4,500-square-foot event space with sloping wood-paneled ceilings and stylish chandeliers. The Alpine Room displays an exposed-rafter ceiling, gorgeous carpeting, and ample space to construct a make-shift dance floor all within an impressive 5,400-square-foot space.

**Services Offered**

The professional and attentive staff at Blue Mountain Resort aims to turn your special event into the occasion you have always dreamed it would be. They will aid you in creating a personalized timeline and schedule so that the day runs smoothly and on time. They can, upon request, provide couples with a list of suggested wedding vendors to minimize the time they would spend searching for them. The venue has a range of enticing wedding packages for couples to consider such as the Platinum, Silver, and Buffet collections. Each package features ample time for reception dinners and a range of cuisine and bar service specialties that can be customized to suit every preference. Couples are encouraged to make use of the event items available to create beautifully designed layouts for their big day.

**Cuisine**

Blue Mountain Resort has an award-winning on-site culinary and catering team that will assist couples in the selection of delicious menus for their event. Each menu provides arrangements of mouth-watering dishes that range from delicate hors d'oeuvres to elaborate plated dishes. This team can also cater to specific dietary needs. Finding the ideal wedding cake will be easier than ever with the venue’s elite pastry chef, who will guide couples through the design process. 

**Location**

The resort is perfectly situated for couples and their guests traveling from afar, with less than a 30-minute drive from Lehigh Valley International Airport. Local hotels, bed and breakfasts, as well as vacation home rentals are all within a reasonable distance for couples who need overnight accommodation. Wedding parties can arrange before- or after-event activities at Jim Thorpe River Adventures and other exciting ventures closeby.

Gismonde Wedding

The staff at Blue were so professional, responsive, and very personal! They engaged in the planning process with great communication, ideas and really had our best interest at heart. Even the day of my wedding, the staff was very efficient and kind when interacting with my guests. The venue space was very clean and well kept. The necessities like the bathrooms, exits and accessible entrances/exits were in the perfect spot. They even made sure handicapped father was able to get to the ceremony site comfortably in a golf cart! Thank you Blue, I recommend them to anyone!

Special shout out to Alana and Emily our coordinators and their teams and Catelyn the wedding cake designer/baker, all were so accommodating and cooperative and made this wedding one for the record books!!! We even let Emily know we will return annually to celebrate our anniversary!!!

Fall wedding of our dreams!

We had the fall wedding of our dreams at Blue Mountain in October! The day would not have been what it was without the help of the incredible staff at Blue Mountain. Mollie was so helpful in the booking process and helping us pick the perfect weekend so we would get the foliage we dreamed of in our pictures. Alana was extremely helpful and patient with us throughout the year and half duration of wedding planning. She answered so many of our questions and had a planning meeting with us onsite and really helped our wedding vision come to life. Cassie was our day of coordinator and she was beyond amazing. I sent millions of emails the week leading up to our wedding and she was always so communicative, responsive, patient, and accommodating. Since we had a Friday wedding, she let us into the (beautiful) Vista ballroom Thursday afternoon to set up our decor before rehearsal started. Catelyn made our simple 2 tier cake and cupcakes look so beautiful on our dessert table. The bar staff was phenomenal as well - Our guests are still talking about how the staff remembered their drink order as soon as they walked up to the bar. The whole Blue team was absolutely incredible. Aside from the staff, the venue is absolutely stunning and the all inclusivity aspect made the planning process a breeze - food, alcohol, onsite shuttle service, day of coordinator, and bridal cabin were all included in the per person price with tax included. We have no regrets about choosing Blue Mountain as our wedding venue and if you are looking for a sign to book with them, this is it! Thank you Blue Mountain for the most amazing wedding!

Best “Something Blue” Ever

Blue Mountain was the first venue we saw, and even though the incredible sales coordinator Mollie could feel the excitement radiating off of us, she suggested we see other venues before committing. We did, and when we called back and booked we made sure to tell her how much we appreciated HER commitment to making sure we found the venue that was right for us. And man, Blue was.   
  
We could write the entire review based on how amazing the people at Blue Mountain are, and how special they made our perfect day. Planning with Alana was a breeze, and she was so patient with all of our many questions and so accommodating to every detailed request we made. The bartender, Robin, was equally accommodating, hopping on a 20 min call with my to discuss my signature drink and ultimately crafting a homemade hot honey syrup for my margarita - which he gave me an early taste of day of. And Lily, our day of coordinator, was a total rockstar - organized and responsive in the lead up and so helpful and thoughtful throughout the night. Finally, our cake was STUNNING - not to mention delicious. Catelyn created the cake of our dreams, complete with our little puppy pawing at one of the layers.   
  
If the people weren’t enough to cement that our decision to host our wedding at Blue was the right one (they were), every other detail confirmed it again and again. The foliage turned out in full force for our October date and we had our run of the place, the food was incredible, the newly re-done bridal cabin was the perfect spot for a midday break, and our guests commented again and again on how perfect everything was. We couldn’t agree more. Our photographers even pulled us aside for a first look of the reception, and the photos don’t disappoint. If you’re looking to throw the best party of your life, take Mollie’s advice and look around, but it’d be hard to beat Blue Mountain Resort.

Everything went smoothly - wouldn't change a thing!

One of the reasons I chose Blue Mountain as my venue was because I wanted the planning process to be as low stress as possible, and the Wedding Coordination team definitely delivered! I always felt like I could reach out to them with any questions and they were happy to help.  
It was great to have high-quality food, drinks, and the wedding cake all inclusive in the final pricing. Everything went smoothly on my day!

Exceptional in every way

Can't say enough about this venue. The wedding coordinators and organizers were phenomenal. They paid attention to all of our requests and needs. The food was fantastic and accommodating, our cake designer worked with us in every way to make our cake perfect. Could not have asked for a better group of individuals who were very professional well organized and coordinated our wedding in such a manner that made it perfect in every way. Thank you so much for everything that you've done to make our wedding as perfect as it was. We love the fact that everything was included in our price the food the drinks the cake and the venue. And the views were spectacular made for great photos.

Blue Mountain was incredible! 

Our day could not have turned out any better! They were so responsive and helpful every single step of the way. Our day of coordinator, Abby, was so attentive and a huge help! She made everything run perfectly and was on top of every little detail. The food was delicious, and the bartenders were efficient and made sure there was never a line. Our cake turned out just as I envisioned thanks to their pastry chef. I really couldn’t have asked for anything more!

Blue Mountain provided quick responses to any questions that we had along the way. They were in touch with us throughout the entire planning time and the day of. Each person that handled each element of the wedding was fantastic. They were professional, easy to work with, and helped me stay organized and on top of what I needed to do on my end.

Perfect Wedding Day

Thank you so much Blue Mountain! We held our wedding this July and the staff was so great throughout the entire process. From the initial inquiry, to the tasting and finally the rehearsal dinner at Slopeside and the big day, the staff was with us every step of the way. We would highly recommend Blue Mountain for your special day!

I've worked up at Blue Mountain many times and they keep improving their wedding services. Most recently, Emily was the coordinator and everything went off perfectly. The staff collaborated with me to make sure that the evening's activities flowed according to the bride and groom's timeline. They also were flexible in moving things around on their end. Not too mention the stunning view at the ceremony and in the ballroom. Great venue for the couple who is looking for that rustic, yet not too rustic (e.g. a barn), wedding. Also great if you enjoy skiing and the outdoors.
