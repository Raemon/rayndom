We loved having Wren as our wedding officiant! We only had a week to work on the ceremony and Wren was willing to do it! Everything turned out perfect and it shows she really cares about her job and you. We had a very private but meaningful ceremony, which was very special with Wren’s help. She will work with you to try and make what you want happen. I truly recommend her!

Such a sweet ceremony that was prepared for us! Easy to book. We we're scrambling for an officiant with the day being less than 2 weeks away and we were able to have the nicest ceremony thanks to Moonlight Wedding Service. We just gave a few of our preferences before hand and ended up with a sweet ceremony! Might I add they gave us advice on copies for our license just all around amazing people! Glad this was who officiated our marriage ❤️

Charley was everything we could’ve hoped for and more as our wedding officiant. He’s very knowledgeable on the entire process and very caring, ensuring the couple is getting exactly what they’re looking for. Charley can do it all and provides endless options - making him a great fit for everyone. Besides that, it’s clear that Charley truly loves what he does, which ultimatelyu is what every couple is looking for. He personalizes what he says, making the ceremony very unique, and is very responsive to any and all questions. Charley was a major factor in us having the wedding of our dreams, and we highly recommend him!

We did the Platinum Package with Andrew and had an amazing experience from start to finish. One of our favorite parts was getting to do the pre-marriage counseling in person—we always made a date night out of it in Downtown Georgetown afterward, which brought us even closer together. Andrew made us feel completely comfortable throughout the entire process. Building our ceremony with him was incredibly easy. He offered thoughtful ideas and meaningful recommendations that we ended up incorporating into our special day, and it truly made the ceremony feel personal and unique to us. We’d absolutely recommend Andrew to anyone looking for a wedding officiant in the Austin area. His professionalism, warmth, and guidance made all the difference!

Jeremy Mark Lane was an amazing officiant! We had a couple of zoom meetings with him prior to our wedding day and we were able to nail down exactly what we wanted our ceremony to look like - from our desire to have a Christ-centered ceremony, to having our own custom vows we repeated, and everything in between. Jeremy really listened to what we were looking for and was able to bring everything together perfectly. We highly recommend him if you are looking for an officiant for your wedding!

We couldn’t have asked for a better officiant for our wedding day! From our first meeting to the final moments of the ceremony, Rick was warm, professional, and genuinely invested in making our day special. He took the time to get to know us, crafted a ceremony that was both meaningful and personal, and delivered it with such grace and sincerity. We wholeheartedly recommend Rick for your special day.

Jennifer was absolutely amazing. She guided us through every step of planning our ceremony, made it easy to give her the information she needed and she then created a ceremony that matched our love and experiences perfectly. I cannot rate her highly enough, all of our guests were talking about how amazing the ceremony was all throughout the reception and into the night! Ensure that your big day is amazing - trust your ceremony to Jennifer!

We opted to do a signing only elopement at their ranch, which has the cutest little chapel. She was the absolute sweetest, made us feel extremely comfortable, and we could feel the love she has for officiating. We had a little ceremony and the opportunity to take pictures and spend time with some adorable animals. I'm a wheelchair user and I was able to access everywhere with a bit of help.
