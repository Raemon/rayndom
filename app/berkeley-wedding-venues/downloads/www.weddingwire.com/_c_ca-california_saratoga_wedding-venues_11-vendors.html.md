We hosted our October 2023 Wedding Ceremony at Hakone and we were so happy with the beautiful gardens and overall experience. The staff at Hakone (Tony and Melia) were extremely helpful, friendly, and easy to work with and they went above and beyond to make sure our rehearsal and ceremony went smoothly. We requested a unique setup with two aisles and we had a large decoration to attach to an arch we rented through a vendor, and they worked with both us and our vendors to make sure that everything was set up just right with plenty of time to spare. They also helped us work through all the important details of the ceremony without being overwhelming, and they did a perfect job executing on the actual ceremony, queuing our party to walk and managing the music and sound system. The garden itself is beautiful in any season. We visited multiple times throughout the year leading up to our wedding and enjoyed different plants in bloom every time. In October, the garden was still lush and green with redwoods, bamboo, and the Koi pond providing amazing variety. Our guests had a great time strolling through the gardens before and after the ceremony, and there were tons of amazing backdrops for our wedding photos. They even gave us a complimentary year-long membership following our wedding so we could come back to relive the memories! In summary, we highly recommend Hakone whether for a wedding ceremony or just a visit!

Most excellent wedding venue! My daughter and her husband had the most beautiful wedding on 9/2025 in Cathedral Oaks for 130 people. The venue was so perfect, the staff was extremely attentive, and food was fantastic . All our guests commented on what a fabulous wedding. Most important of all, the bride and groom were so happy! I most highly recommend this for a wedding venue. It is such a lovely place, surrounded by spring fed creeks, shade trees, and natural beauty! Thank you Saratoga Springs staff!

My daughter and new son-in-law got married at The Mountain Winery on October 22, 2022. My husband and I were very involved, and I travelled from Montana twice to scout venues. Lindsay and Sam had previously gone on a date for a concert at the Winery, and it ended up being their first choice for wedding venue. It was stressful making these decisions, but we couldn't be happier with this choice. We had family come from as far as Virginia, and most stayed in Los Gatos (also wonderful). Tiffany in particular was a gem; very knowledgable, responsive, super nice. The whole staff was great, and Global Gourmet, the required caterer for this venue, did a wonderful job, too. This venue is not a "budget choice", but it was a magical day, and well worth it for us. We invited 100 and had about 75 guests attend. We also had a full service wedding planner (Lavender Crown Events), since we were from out of town, as were the bride and groom, and we were happy with that decision as well. One more thing is that we hired a limousine service, Sal's Airport & Limousine Service, (we had an executive coach) to transport out-of-town guests without cars from Los Gatos to the venue. I highly recommend this, and it was one of the more affordable items. Our guests really appreciated it.

Dina's Deluxe Events (featured on the Knot and Wedding Wire too) recommends Villa Montalvo as a fabulous venue with beautiful trees, gardens, fountains, sculptures and floor plans for your wedding or other celebration! 5 stars to this amazing venue with a beautiful view, romantic settings and wonderful staff! We had the pleasure of having an event at Montalvo Villa and it turned out beautiful. The staff was so helpful, professional and the beautiful venue was a great fit for our luxury event.

I LOVE the Saratoga Country Club. I may be a little biased because I grew up going there with my family, but I didn't even have to consider looking into another venue. It was beautiful, spacious and very accommodating. The only thing we did not like was they only allow weddings to go till 10-11 pm. It felt like the beginning of the night was just getting started. Still would have not changed a single thing about the location. beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!

We looked at a ton of venues throughout the Bay Area to host our wedding reception and are so glad we picked the Saratoga Foothill Club. It is a lovely, historic space and it had all the amenities we needed to throw a great party for ~100 guests.

Anne from the church was so helpful from beginning to end. She answered my zillions of questions, let us visit the church to take measurements, and was instrumental during the wedding weekend. Not only did she facilitate the wedding rehearsal, but she kept everything running smoothly on the day of the wedding, even helping us time the walk down the aisle. Thank you for going above and beyond, Anne!
