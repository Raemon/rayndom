Indulge Chocolat made the most beautiful Love Chocolate Bars for my wedding, and incorporated the blue tones of my bridal party attire into the chocolate design, which was so unique. The chocolate was delicious and they do not use tree nuts, so my son who has an allergy, was able to enjoy them as well. They responded quickly and with professionalism and delivered them to the reception site with no additional charge. I cannot recommend them highly enough!

If nothing else.. not only was this such a cool touch to our wedding but the cigar roller was an absolute hoot! Our guests loved talking to him and not only were his cigars amazing but he had people laughing especially me. He is so knowledgeable in his craft! It was amazing to see guests over at his table getting their custom cigar. He even provides personalized cigar bands for the wedding day

Everyone loved the cigars and they recommended to come at a later time than originally planned which ended up being perfect. All the guests were able to enjoy the cigars at the venue and some took some home!

Don Rosario was incredible! He is an amazing person to work with. He is incredible at his craft, was so easy and amazing to work with, and produced absolutely excellent cigars. What made it even better was his personality. He is a energetic, genuine, and happy person to work with. He engaged with everyone who visited his beautifully set up station with a huge smile on his face. It was amazing I really hope to work with him again!
