We are so grateful to have had the chance to work with the Allegro Chamber Players for our wedding. Their repertoire is impressively vast, and each piece was performed with such passion and artistry. They created the perfect ambiance for both our ceremony and cocktail hour, setting the tone in the most beautiful way. We coordinated primarily with Michael, who was kind, communicative, and professional throughout the entire process. He was also wonderfully accommodating—helping us make our selections feel uniquely our own. Thank you, Michael and the entire Allegro team, for helping make our day so special! We'd give you 6-stars if we could!

Becky and her Jazz Quartet were fantastic! She played lovely music before during and after the ceremony, including a custom composition. Then during cocktails and dinner, her quartet WOW'd the audience, we received MANY compliments about the wonderful vibe. The bassist laid down some sweet lines, the drummer was in the pocket, and the keyboardist made us dream of Robert Glasper and Bill Evans. Becky's voice is angelic and her steel pan drumming is unreal, do NOT HESITATE to hire her!

Laura's music was beautiful and amazing. I walked down the aisle to her rendition of "La Vie En Rose" and have been listening to the song everyday since! The mere sight of the harp and harpist are just gorgeous...and then she begins to play. It was like being in a dream. I simply can't put into words how special she made our day. I would highly recommend Laura Cole to anyone who is looking to give their event that final, unforgettable touch.

Emily and her team were amazing!! So responsive, so talented, accommodated my special requests and provided suggestions on accompaniments. The day of, my husband and I were hiding and the quartet graciously played a special request again just so I could hear it. I’m so grateful they were a part of my special day.

We worked with Matt for our wedding ceremony in May, 2022 and had a great experience! Matt was super organized and helped us plan all of our music selections for our ceremony, and played one of our favorite songs for the bridal processional, which made the ceremony personalized and special. Matt provided all his own equipment to amplify sound which was very helpful. Our ceremony music was beautiful - we highly recommend working with Matt!

Teresa is extremely talented and can make any arrangement of music work for your big day. She filled the space with a calm and magical air, and made my ceremony even more whimsical. She’s easy to talk with and affordable.

I planned my wedding in Rhode Island from California. Needless to say, it was stressful. I based a lot of my decisions on vendors upon responsiveness to emails and (sometimes) phone calls. Steve did not disappoint. He was very easy to communicate with and very accommodating with requests. He even learned a special song that I'd requested!!! My guests loved the laid back, but professional vibe he produced for our ceremony and cocktail hour. I would not hesitate to recommend his service to our family and friends. He definitely got the party started on the right foot. It was great. (Thanks Steve!)

Take 2 was a wonderful addition to our outdoor ceremony in Central, Mass. They added elegance and joy to our ceremony and cocktail hour. Many of our guests complimented how lovely the music was, while my husband and I were out taking our "couples pictures." A lovely addition to any ceremony and I highly recommend them.

WOW! Steven is the most incredible singer and made our wedding cocktail hour and dinner feel like we were taken back in a time machine to the Frank Sinatra era! Our guests could not get over how amazing he was! He made our night so incredibly special!

Having Mary play the harp at our wedding ceremony was a beautiful addition to our day. Mary is a very talented harpist and her music made the overall vibe of the ceremony so beautiful. I would recommend hiring Mary to anyone getting married!
