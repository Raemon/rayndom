Best day ever!

Connelly and Caitlin were incredibly helpful the day of the wedding. They went above and beyond to ensure that our day went smoothly. Throughout the whole process, they were professional and well prepared. From planning, getting information, and helping move the pace of the night. They kept the party rocking and brought so much energy to the dance floor!

If you're looking for a DJ/photographer duo, I highly recommend Chippewa Valley Wedding Crashers! I recently got married and CVWC made our day simple! Leading up to your big day, they meet with you and take consideration of everything you want/don't want to make your day perfect. Not to mention, they provide you with a planner to fill out and communicate the day of details with all other vendors to allow you to simply focus on you and your day. Thank you, CVWC!

Awesome DJ! 

Connelly was an amazing DJ for our wedding! He kept people on the dance floor all night long! I had requested a very last minute accommodation and Connelly absolutely delivered it! I would highly recommend Chippewa Valley Wedding Crashers for your wedding!

Wonderful Wedding DJ

Connelly and Caitlyn were absolutely wonderful to work with! Communication was great from the moment we booked with them to the day of the wedding. They asked all of the right questions in order to help make our wedding day perfect.   
  
The dance floor always had someone on it thanks to the music they played! We got MANY compliments day of about the DJ and the music that was played. I would definitely recommend!

We loved our wedding photographer!

We had an amazing experience working with Caitlin as our photographer on our wedding day. She was easy going and organized and brought lots of experience that took a lot off of my shoulders in terms of capturing the special moments of our day. All members of the team were quick to reply which is also helpful when trying to get ducks in a row. We appreciated the 30 minute couples shoot as part of our package. It was a great entry into working with Caitlin and we got some great photos!
