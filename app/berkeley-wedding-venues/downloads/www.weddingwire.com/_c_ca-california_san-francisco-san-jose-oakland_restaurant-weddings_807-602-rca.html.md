I had my wedding here and couldn’t be happier with the choice. The staff did an amazing job and made sure the whole day ran smoothly. The food and drinks were excellent, and everyone kept saying how much they enjoyed everything. All of our guests had a great time, and it ended up being the perfect spot for our wedding.

We couldn't have asked for a more perfect venue than The Terrace Room for our wedding day. From the moment we stepped into the space, we were captivated by its classic elegance, sweeping views of Lake Merritt, and the warm, welcoming atmosphere that made us feel instantly at ease. The historic charm of the art deco architecture paired beautifully with the modern amenities it truly felt timeless and sophisticated. The natural light streaming in through the large windows added a magical touch to our reception, and our guests are still raving about how stunning everything looked! The food was absolutely delicious far beyond typical "wedding food" expectations and the service was top-notch. Every guest felt taken care of, which meant the world to us. If you're looking for a venue that's not only visually breathtaking but also run by a professional and passionate team, look no further than The Terrace Room. It was the perfect place to begin our married life, and we’ll treasure the memories forever.

Angelica's is such an amazing place to have our wedding, and we feel so lucky to have Crystal meticulously organize and coordinate everything for us for the event, from menu selection, floral design, wine pairing, and table/venue setting up, to rehearsal and on-the-day coordination. Crystal and Angelica are extremely accomondating and flexible, actively willing to offer assistance and provide valuable suggestions. All of your guests, vendors, and, most importantly, the most nervous people of the day, you and your loved one, will always be welcomed and soothed by the composure of Crystal and her fast-acting service team. You are in great hands with the Angelica's team to have your once-in-a-life experience and happy moments there.

Adrianna Castaneda and the staff at Scott's were very helpful and responsive in the entire wedding process. Shanna and I planned our ceremony at Skyline Community Church, but opted to hold our reception at Scott's. Adrianna answered any and all questions and made herself available to meet with us a few times to go over all of the details and double check everything. The reception went so smooth and we could not be happier. All of our guests enjoyed the food, music, venue, and service. If you are looking to hold a special event down the road, then I highly recommend giving Scott's Seafood a call. Shanna and I were very happy and will definitely be using them again to plan a future event. Thank you Scott's and thank you again Adrianna for all of your help!

Nayong Filipino provided the food for our appetizers and dinner, as well as provided a coffee station. We got an appetizer station and a Filipino buffet that came with a lechon (a whole pig) for 100 people. The catering staff was very professional and attended to the buffet while our guests walked through. They served my husband and I at our sweetheart table, which was awesome because we got to eat right when we sat down. They even brought us more food when we requested it. Our guests loved the food and felt like there was no shortage of it! The buffet was up for 3 hours, so guests were able to come back for seconds or thirds throughout the night. Before they broke down, they provided to-go containers, so some guests were able to take food home for midnight snacks. Throughout the planning process, we communicated with Marc. He provided a lot of information, and worked with us to find the right package that fit our needs. He was responsive to our emails and was very flexible with the many changes and special requests we had for the food.

We had our wedding reception at Twenty Five Lusk, and it was an absolute dream. The space is gorgeous and perfectly captures the urban/rustic mix we love so much about San Francisco itself. We reserved the bottom floor, with a mix of banquet seating and lounge seating, which encouraged our guests to mix and mingle and made our wedding a fantastic party. The secret tunnel of rooms behind the bar became our favorite feature of the night, too: my (now) husband and I were able to hide back there during the dinner portion and enjoy our dinners in peace while peeking through the small window at our guests enjoying themselves in the main area, and later in the night groups of friends circulated back there, enjoying the secrecy of it all. And while we chose Twenty Five Lusk because of the gorgeous space (and as noted above, it well exceeded our greatest hopes), the food and drinks were AMAZING ended up stealing the show. Our guests STILL rave about how good the food and drinks were! And the service at Twenty Five Lusk was absolutely fantastic. Planning a wedding is stressful, especially where you're doing all of the planning yourself (as we were), and Twenty Five Lusk went way above and beyond, even arranging for us the rental of cocktail-height tables and linens to match with our aesthetic. And all of this--gorgeous space, divine food, fantastic service--at a fraction of what we would have paid for ANY other reception option in San Francisco (we know, because we did extensive research). Like our decision to get married, choosing Twenty Five Lusk for our reception is one of the best decisions we've ever made. We can't recommend them enough!

We looked around at a bunch of different venues for a couple months, but it was difficult to find a place we loved for our guest count of 200. When we found Aracely, we knew almost immediately that this was it—beautiful sunlit garden area, cute cafe space, and just a dream of a courtyard with flowing white curtains topped off with string-lit skylight dome. We loved that they were able to do the food, drinks, furnishings, and reception set-up, and coordination internally, which helped us out so much and saved us from too much planning craziness. Linda and her team are super professional, knowledgeable, and have a keen eye for design, and Tina, our day-of-coordinator, was extremely kind, patient, flexible, and just wonderful to work with. Even with the typical wedding day chaos, the Aracely team somehow rolled with the punches and made everything work out really well :) The kitchen staff and menu selection are ON POINT. All of our guests loved the dishes, appetizers, and drinks, as did we! Located in an old elementary school on treasure island, Aracely takes an old structure and turns it into something beautiful. Thank you Aracely for the kindness, the deliciousness, and the loveliness you gave to our special day!

We had a wonderful experience with Il Fornaio in downtown Sacramento. Our wedding was a small backyard ceremony in West Sacramento, followed by a dinner reception at Il Fornaio for 44 people. We reserved the piazza, which was beautiful and perfect for our needs. The coordination: Fiorella, who was the banquet coordinator, is just amazing. She is kind, efficient, and very responsive. The prices and requirements are transparent and easy to understand, and there were no surprises at all. There was no fee to rent the facility, and the dinner menus were diverse and very reasonably priced. We ended up using a standard menu, but they were willing to work with us to substitute in second vegetarian option. They let us bring in sparkling cider for toasting (a high percentage of non drinkers in my wedding) at no additional charge. Cost: Very reasonable. After everything, including microphone rental, cost of dinners, tax, gratuity, and alcohol, my reception ended up about $60 per person. That's a rough figure. Venue: Beautiful. The piazza has space for 5 tables of 10, and while they are slightly separated with planters and trellises, it is really a gorgeous space. We had to have the doors to the main restaurant open because (yay for us) it was 105 degrees on the day of our wedding. The piazza itself is not air conditioned, but with the doors from the main restaurant open it was a very comfortable temperature. Unfortunately, this did make the space a little less private and very loud. The older folks did mention to me later on that it was hard to hear what was said for portions of the reception. The food is AMAZING and everyone loved their meals. Service was great though at times a little disorganized. We had some confusion about microphones but in the end staff bent over backwards to make it work. I am extremely pleased with Il Fornaio and will always be grateful for their part in my wedding day.
