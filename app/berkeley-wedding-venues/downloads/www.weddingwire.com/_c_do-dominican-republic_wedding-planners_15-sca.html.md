First of all I would like to say I loved Novella team!!! From beginning to end they helped my dream wedding come true. My wedding was over the top beautiful and I would do all over again in a heart beat. Carlota is the owner she is very knowledgeable, passionate and a blessing, she looks out for you and wants the best for you and has your best interest at heart always. For that I appreciated her so much through all the stress that comes with wedding planning. She was always their to answer my questions. Secondly her team assistant Mariana wow what a sweet, funny and easy going person she was, she helped coordinate my wedding food menu, drinks, some decor,music etc, she was like the missing puzzle to ease my nerves when I felt overwhelmed with the planning process she was truly a life savor! Thirdly the most amazing and talented Liza, decor manager wow she brings your vision to life to the max just beyond beautiful a true work of art! Next, the most sweetest and I mean the most patient wedding coordinator I’ve ever meet in the world named Naomi, not only she helped me from the start when I was getting ready at my bridal suite, she carried my dress, viel, helped me change into my second dress we laughed because she even dried my sweat behind my hair ( we all know DR heat is no joke) from all the dancing lol she was just all around amazing.

We truly cannot recommend Viva’L Festa enough. Hands down, the best wedding planners in the Dominican Republic. Throughout our year and a half of planning, Melissa, Lisa, Franklin and their entire team were absolutely incredible. They recommended the best vendors, were extremely transparent with budgeting, and most importantly were always honest about what they felt was truly necessary for the event, even if that meant advising us not to spend on something. That level of integrity is priceless throughout this process and made me give them my 100% trust. We had monthly meetings, and the entire process felt seamless and surprisingly stress-free. As a very Type A and anxious person, I can honestly say I never felt overwhelmed because I had complete trust in this team. When it came to design, Melissa truly listened to every dream, wish, and inspiration I had for my wedding and she delivered beyond anything I could have imagined. The design was absolutely beautiful, and our guests were completely wowed. On top of that, the team is incredibly organized when it comes to logistics, budgeting, and vendor management. They handled everything flawlessly, allowing us to fully enjoy the experience without stressing over the countless details that come with a large event. This team is truly exceptional not only talented professionals, but wonderful people. Working with Viva’L Festa was an absolute joy, and we are beyond grateful for them. They gave us the best day of our lives and a once in a lifetime experience for all of our friends and family!!

Where do I even begin? From the very start of the wedding planning process to the final moments of our reception, Deborath was absolutely incredible. She was always quick to respond—whether it was over WhatsApp, Zoom, phone, or email—no matter what we needed to feel confident and excited about our big day. Right from the beginning, it was clear that she knew exactly what she was doing. One moment that stands out happened just after we landed in Punta Cana. About 30 minutes into our shuttle ride to Casa de Campo, we realized we had left a hanging bag at the airport containing my dad’s and brother’s suits, along with my mom’s dress. The driver didn’t speak English, and we started to panic. We messaged Deborath, and within seconds, she replied saying she would handle it. She immediately got in touch with the driver, had him turn around, and saved the day. Truly a lifesaver! When we arrived at Casa de Campo, Deborath was waiting for us in the lobby with the warmest welcome. She took my dress and my husband’s suit to be steamed and collected all the items we brought for the big day. Then she sat down with us to discuss backup options, just in case it rained. Thankfully the weather held out, but it was such a relief to know she was already thinking ahead and had a plan in place. Deborath also became my emotional support person that week—no exaggeration. Right before I walked down the aisle with my dad, the violin started playing, and I was suddenly overwhelmed with emotion. It hit me all at once: the joy, the relief, and the release of a year’s worth of planning. I started to panic, but Deborath saw it in my eyes, stepped in, and helped calm me down. I’ll never forget that moment. I cannot recommend Deborath and her team enough. They are absolute professionals, kindhearted, and genuinely gifted at what they do. Our wedding was everything we hoped for and more, thanks to her.

Thank you to @dlouigeneweddingplanner and the entire team! I had the blessing of getting married, and you were without a doubt a fundamental part of it all. Thank you for all the work, the attention to detail, and your support throughout the process. Everything you did was done with love, and it showed in how beautiful everything turned out. It was even better than I ever dreamed or imagined. We are left with the best experience and grateful hearts. Thank you! May God bless you ❤️

Fuimos invitados a una boda que realizó este equipo, su profesionalismo, la decoración del ambiente. su hospitalidad con todos, y como se veían siempre al pendiente de la novia e incluso la forma en la que se dirigían hacia nosotros los invitados fue increíble. Pronto mi esposo y yo nos casaremos y sin lugar a dudas serán ellos. Desde ya emocionados. 😍

Planning a destination wedding can feel overwhelming...especially for two people who had never done it before, couldn’t speak Spanish, and had a very particular vision in mind. We fell in love with Casa de Campo in 2024 and booked our 2025 wedding there, but once planning began, we quickly realized how confusing and stressful the process was becoming. In a moment of panic, truly thinking our dream wedding might not happen, I reached out to Laura and the INVENT team. From the very first call, Laura put us at ease. She immediately took action, calmed our nerves, and worked with the hotel to completely revise our contract so that she and her team could take the reins. From then on, Laura, Suanny, Mildred, Linette, Leticia, Madeline, Maria, and Nicole were with us every step of the way. They answered endless WhatsApp messages, created beautifully organized Asana boards with clear tasks for both us and their team, and guided us with thoughtful recommendations on design, vendors, and activities. We had a strict budget, and somehow Laura and her team made the impossible possible. Every detail was perfectly executed, and each event left us and our guests absolutely speechless. From the florals to the décor, nothing was overlooked. Our entire wedding weekend was filled with joy and heart because of their work! Hiring INVENT was, without question, the best decision and investment we made for our wedding!! They created the most beautiful and memorable experience—not just for us, but for every single one of our guests. Throughout the wedding weekend, they were unbelievably attentive: checking in with us, ensuring every detail ran smoothly, even hand-stitching my second-look dress (thank you, Maria!) so it fit better on the morning of the wedding. On top of everything, they captured countless behind-the-scenes videos and content that we’ll cherish forever. More than planners, Laura and the INVENT team were the heart behind our wedding. They turned our vision into reality and created memories we’ll cherish for a lifetime. Without them, our dream day would not have been possible. We are forever thankful!! If you’re planning a destination wedding, don’t hesitate—put your full trust in the INVENT team. From the very beginning, you’ll see just how essential it is to have a planner by your side when you’re coordinating from another country. They make the impossible feel effortless. We will miss our daily WhatsApp texts with the INVENT team, but can't wait to see all the beautiful weddings they will continue to create! Thank you INVENT, we love you guys!! All the best, The Mansfield's

I cannot recommend this amazing team enough! From the very beginning, they were meticulous in every detail, truly listening to all my needs and understanding exactly what I envisioned for my wedding. They managed to create an event that was both intimate and absolutely stunning, exceeding my expectations in every way. Their communication skills were exceptional — I always felt informed, supported, and understood throughout the entire process. Planning a destination wedding can be stressful, but they made it effortless and enjoyable. If you’re looking for someone who will bring your dream wedding to life with grace, precision, and beauty, look no further.

If you are looking for a wedding planner that is centered around making the planning process and day special for YOU and your partner, she is absolutely the gal for you. I was looking for a wedding planner who could support me in the aspects I was not good at or thinking about (design, general wedding details), provide support while I was planning from out of state, connect me to qualified vendors that fit my vision and approach to planning, help me pull to life my DIY ideas, help navigate questions from my parents, as well as generally make me feel comfortable asking any questions and requests from her leading up to the special day (yes, I did ask her to switch up the wedding design decor multiple times). She would hop on Facetimes when I needed her and also sent special pick me ups on days we had planning to-dos, like venue taste tests and engagement photo shoots. She also would tackle emails that I was too overwhelmed to do (took care of furniture rentals) while also toeing the line in letting vendors take the reins in 1 on 1 meetings with me when it came to design.
