The grounds and mansion at the Gray Gables Estate is an ethereal and elegant wedding venue in Portland, Oregon. The Manor House was constructed in the early 20th century and, with its beautiful gardens, gives off a magical atmosphere. The luscious and historic location combined with the fantastic and passionate service of the estate’s staff help make for a wedding to remember.

This charming location boasts a total of four spaces for hosting both wedding ceremonies and receptions. Exchange vows or dine in The Garden with its Grecian gazebo steeped in a historical, romantic air. You can also walk down the aisle on the quaint and rustic Manor House Lawn, which though spacious, exudes intimacy. These classical gardens are dotted with towering trees and romantic brick paths and patios. In The Rustic Koi Pond, enter an enchanting forest and say “I do” under the cool shade. The lush area possesses water features and gorgeous vegetation, for a bucolic atmosphere. These various outdoor spaces can accommodate up to 300 loved ones. Inside, couples and their guests can utilize The Ballroom. This space features large windows that let the natural light stream in for a calming ambiance and a hardwood dance floor for an extra dash of visual sophistication.

Overall great time

Jennifer & staff did a great job for our wedding! The food was great & the set up was beautiful. The only thing I’d say we wish was different was the AC (wish it was cooler inside) & having a little bit more guidance as far as what to expect next - the day of. Would highly recommend this venue!

Becky and Rick groom's parents 

We attended our son's wedding here on July 22, 2023. What an enchanting venue for a wedding. The grounds were beautiful and the staff were professional and very friendly and helpful. We would highly recommend Gray Gables to anyone looking for a beautiful setting for a perfect wedding. Thank you Gray Gables for making a beautiful day even more beautiful.

Absolutely amazing venue! 

We used this venue last year for my daughter’s wedding and I cannot tell you how amazing they did at coordination (Samantha was phenomenal!), the food was some of the best food we’ve ever had, the decor, the bar, the staff, attention to detail and the overall event went so well. I couldn’t recommend this venue enough. We also used the flower shop next door and they did the most beautiful floral arrangements. Top notch!

Best decision we made in wedding planning

I’m writing this review on the first day of our honeymoon because that’s how amazing Samantha, the wedding coordinator at Gray Gables venue, and her entire team were, both during the planning process and especially on our wedding day.   
  
Top 3 reasons we loved Gray Gables for our wedding  
  
(1) Samantha, wedding coordinator extraordinaire. We planned our wedding in 4 months, and Sam was always ready and available to help and guide us. In short, she’s the worlds best wedding Sherpa. She worked seamlessly with our outside vendors and her in house team flawlessly executed the services GG offers.  
  
(2) The beautiful outdoor and indoor spaces. This natural beauty and landscaping, and classy indoor decor, was ideal for our weddings for two reasons. The first, we had a great indoor backup plan option for the ceremony in the case of rain (it’s Portland). Secondly, we only needed to provide minimal decor and some flowers to make it wedding ready.   
  
(3) The food was incredible. This is not only my opinion - this was the resounding opinion of all our our guests. We selected comfort foods (ravioli, chicken, mashed potatoes, fried mac and cheese) and through a combination of talent and magic, the chef and gray gables team made the presentation of comfort food beautiful and remarkable (I literally heard remarks about this).

Dream wedding

Grey Gables was perfect. Jennifer was amazing and everything exceeded our expectations. The venue is beautiful and the photographs are going to be incredible. The food was outstanding, the professionalism and efficiency of all the staff members made this day absolutely perfect. We were from out of state and just showed up and Jennifer took care of us completely. My daughter's dream wedding became reality and I would give 10 stars if I could :)

The most amazing venue 

This is the first and last venue we toured. We fell in love with the grounds and booked immediately. Samantha is also the best. She took a huge weight off our shoulders on the big day and even with our hiccups that day, everything was transitioned smoothly and it was the best day of our lives. She was so easy to get a hold of and answered every question we had. We also had the most amazing food through gray gables as well. Everyone couldn’t stop raving about all of it! We were blown away by every aspect and highly recommend everything about gray gables!

Best all-in-one venue

Gray Gables Estate was the first and only venue we toured and we could not have been happier. The aesthetic fit our vision perfectly and when we found out that we got the entire site for the entire day of the wedding, we were sold.   
  
Samantha Maiden was responsive, always positive, and professional. And because she is also the site owner AND wedding coordinator we could tell that she would go the extra mile. It was evident from the first day we met Sam and toured the venue that she was personally invested in making our wedding a huge success. She also ran our wedding rehearsal making us feel extra confident that we were in good hands; she has a ton of knowledge of what makes wedding work fly (e.g. timing, spacing, who goes where when, etc.) that we could trust her advice with the agenda and running point on the day of.   
  
The food was also INCREDIBLE! My family has a ton of dietary issues and Samantha and her team were happy and experienced to work with us so that everyone could enjoy the dinner.  
  
We also had Forte Floral do our flowers (they partner with GGE and are located right next door) which made set up and tear down a breeze because they did it all!   
  
Thanks for making our day better than we could have ever imagined! Couldn't recommend GGE enough!

Priceless help

Jennifer made everything run so smoothly and was open to being flexible with our needs. She was ready with tips and ideas to help us when we were at a loss. She was attentive, the venue itself was gorgeous and the wait staff and in-house catering was the talk of the town. I am so happy that we chose this as our venue and couldn't imagine having done it anywhere else.

Can't recommend ENOUGH!!

I've been writing this review in my head for the last month because I knew I had to make it as amazing and I felt towards our venue and the owner, Samantha. My now-husband and I looked at 6 venues and none could compare to Gray Gables Estate (GGE). Besides swiping yes to my future husband, choosing GGE to be our spot was the best decision I could have made! The venue itself is breathtakingly gorgeous, serene and just beautiful. We wanted everything outdoors - and it worked magically. But - the very BEST thing about GGE was Samantha. She is the owner and wedding coordinator, and by the end of our wedding, I wanted to marry her instead! She was flawless in every step, she knew what myself and my bridal party needed before we even asked. She literally anticipated every single thing you could imagine. She facilitated all the rentals we would need, so that I only had to work with her. She suggested tons of great ideas which were all perfect. She was accommodating to my random requests (brought in baby goats!) and politely dealt with some unruly groomsmen during rehearsal. Day of wedding was so stress free for me, and all because of Sam! She wrangled the cake delivery, musicians arriving, DJ coming, GOATS!, photo booth, and allll the rental deliveries! I was able to relax with my girls in the awesome house and just enjoyed every minute of my day.   
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND CHOOSE GRAY GABLES ESTATE FOR YOUR WEDDING!!!
