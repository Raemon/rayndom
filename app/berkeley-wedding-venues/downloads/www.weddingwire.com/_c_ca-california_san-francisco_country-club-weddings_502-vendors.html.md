Working with Tracey put me at ease. Her experience and professionalism were beyond my expectations! She literally was able to "predict the future" and help us make informed decisions that spared us stress and heartache on our wedding day and general planning. Her response time to emails and phone calls I wish people would take a lesson from her on that. It was flawless which made her so accountable and trustworthy. This is what every couple needs in a very fun yet, stressful time in their lives. Tracey is an asset to this venue.
