We were supposed to have our wedding at Cinnabar in September, 2020, which of course had to be canceled due to COVID! So, we contacted Cinnabar to move it back a year to 2021 and they were extremely accommodating. Unfortunately, the wedding in 2021 got canceled due to the delta variant. So then we decided to cancel our wedding altogether and just make it a smaller anniversary celebration of our February 2020 wedding in India (which thankfully happened before COVID started). Cinnabar was extremely supportive throughout all these decision changes. Finally, our anniversary celebration took place last week (Feb, 2022) and it couldn't have gone better!! Bella and Kristy were amazing! They made sure everything was set up the way we wanted it to be. For us, what made Cinnabar stand out from the other venues we visited were... 1) Beautiful location- the drive up to the golf course is sooo extremely scenic and of course the venue is really really pretty. 2) Beautiful reception hall- I mean the reception hall looks beautiful without any decorations, just as is! It is surrounded on two sides with glass doors and windows, which look out to the lush and undulating golf course! 3) Awesome food- the food at Cinnabar is awesome! They have a restaurant onsite for the golf course and we ate there when we went to the venue for the first time. So we knew right off the bat that their food would be good. They do require that the food be catered by them. But trust me, that's a great thing! Our guests were soo happy with the food. When we went for the tasting before our event, we were so happy with all the food that instead of choosing three appetizers from the four we tasted, we decided to keep all four. Same was true for the entrees. We tasted three and were supposed to choose two. Instead we kept all three! 4) Bella and Kristy- awesome event coordinators. They made sure everything was seamless. We didn't have to worry about anything! They helped us choose the really beautiful linens, chargers and napkins. We had wanted blush table cloths with gold napkins. Bella suggested that we change to ivory napkins instead. That was a great choice, because the gold napkins wouldn't look good. Also, they were extremely helpful with our desserts, which were catered by an outside vendor. They made sure the desserts were kept in the fridge and brought them out at the right time to be served to the guests! 5) Bar- there's a bar in the reception hall and we chose to go for the pay by consumption option. So our guests got whatever it is that they wanted, which was great! All in all, this wedding (rather anniversary) venue was just perfect! This is probably one of the best venues in the bay area as far as value for money is concerned.

One of our lovely couples had a wedding at Silver Creek Valley Country Club this fall. Life.Film team really enjoyed the location by being wedding photographers and videographers there. The event manager of the venue had contact us several month before the day of and invited for the tour around the venue. She shows us all the best spots for the pictures and explained us the policy for the photographers there. The location has plenty of spot for the great wedding photos wasteful area, ceremony area, staircase Such a pleasure to work at this beautiful location for us! Can’t wait to capture our next event there. http://life.film/wedding/

San Jose Country Club was the perfect spot for our wedding reception! It is a beautiful area located in the foothills of San Jose. Jackie was the event coordinator and she went above and beyond to help make our day perfect! She provided a list of their top vendors and we utilized that list. Everything from the table linens, room arrangement, and flowers were prefect. The staff was very friendly and professional. The food was AMAZING. My husband and I still receive compliments on how great the food was. Jackie even arranged to take my husband out at sunset to the top of the golf course and take beautiful sunset photos over looking the valley. The day was a dream come true.
