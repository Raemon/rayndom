Working with the team at Bella Flora was a dream come true! I had Bella Flora in mind (from following their work on facebook) for years prior to my engagement. So when the day came that it was my turn to book a florist and expert in decor & more, they were my first vendor to book! Kelly, Lynn and Emily are such a dynamic team. Being the best in the business, they are well connected across many entities and helped us find our amazing Wedding Coordinator, DJ and nailed down every aspect of our venue as they are experts on so many different venues they have been to before! My first meeting with Bella Flora consisted of sharing all of my hopes and dreams for our wedding day a year following our first meeting! I was able to share pictures, look at pictures they had previously taken of their work and clients along with get ideas and inspiration. From this point, they took my ideas and ran with them! The normal, the crazy, and the spectacular- they made each of them happen in the months to follow! Our second meeting with them, we talked about vendors I had booked and more intentional dreams that I had curated after searching for what felt right for our big day. After this meeting, they sent us many options detailed with the exact flowers and looks we were going for. The team took into account different price points to meet our budget, all of which were beautifully curated. Our third and final meeting was my favorite! During this time, Kelly, Lynn and Emily had our table set up that would look just like our wedding! WOW this was the best day. Seeing all of your dreams come to life was spectacular. From here, they were able to change out different aspects of the table we wanted to revise, see what we loved and what different options would be from the smallest things such as silverware, chargers, how napkins were placed to the larger details of the actual flowers that would be at the event! I will attach pictures to this review to show you the magic they set up in their showroom that day. One of my favorite parts of working with Bella Flora is not only their personalization and connection they had with us, but the endless options and possibilities we had when we worked with them! Their showroom is nothing short of fabulous and has everything for any style of wedding to make your vision come to life. The day before our wedding, Emily took time prior to the wedding to ensure that my bouquet was exactly how I wanted it and was willing to make any changes as needed. She showed me how to hold it in pictures and made me feel comfortable about the care of my bouquet on our wedding day! On our wedding day, I came down from the bridal suite to the most magical hallway filled with all of the florals that were carefully designed for my vision. I said to Emily that this was a “Magic Hallway” and her response was “This is your magic hallway Laura!”. Kelly gave me the biggest hug and the excitement that they had for me on my big day just radiated in all that they did! From the dance floor, perfectly curated florals, amazing tablescapes, cake florals, personal touches, and more. This team is truly unmatched and really were the “fairy godmothers” that made each of my dreams come true! Thank you to Kelly, Lynn and Bella for ALL their dedication in making my day a success.

Highly recommend Jenn for any of your flower needs! She made everything so easy! I was able to message her with any questions or concerns, she always answered quickly and with all the information I needed! Our flowers turned out amazing, exactly what I wanted. The day of our wedding she was able to come to our venue and place our flowers on the cake! She definitely goes above and beyond!

We used Memorable Moments for our vow renewal last weekend. To say they did a fantastic job as an understatement. We met with them early and they came up with arrangement's that fit our style and budget and were fantastic to work with. Kerri and her team did a fantastic job checking in as the event got closer and plans for "day of". Along with the table decor (greenery and candles), my bouquet, they created a beautiful arch piece for our outdoor ceremony that we could repurpose for our sweetheart table. It was the most beautiful day and Memorable Moments played a huge part in that! You will not be disappointed if you choose them to create floral arrangements for your event!

Linda was great to work with and does a beautiful job! We received so many compliments on our flowers and I love that I can keep them forever without a huge preservation process! She also incorporated some additional items I provided into my bridal bouquet and me husband's boutonniere!

Danielle was instrumental in our wedding going perfectly. She provided the flowers and all of our centerpieces. It was so helpful that she could set up, help with our room flip, and tear down so we didn't have to worry about any of it. Danielle was the most prompt in responding to questions and requests which was so helpful in the planning process.

We are using Ali's Weeds for our florist and they have wonderful taste. I am NOT a flower girl or a girly girl so I had no idea what to do... she whipped it up and put it all together for me which is PRICELESS. She is going to make our ceremony and reception beautiful with ceremony flowers, bridal party flowers, and even center pieces! They are setting up everything and I go in the day before to make sure it is all exactly how I wanted. No surprises the day of like my sister had at her wedding. I could not have asked for a better florist. She got me excited for the flowers at my wedding day which I didn't think was even possible, and thats how it should be! Not to mention, when I left our first meeting she gave me a bouquet of flowers to keep, the second meeting, I left with a piece of homemade pie! Wonderful to work with. :)

Janis was great! Our flowers were beautiful and she had creative ways to get the most bang for our buck. She was also very flexible with our schedule and willing to accomodate.
