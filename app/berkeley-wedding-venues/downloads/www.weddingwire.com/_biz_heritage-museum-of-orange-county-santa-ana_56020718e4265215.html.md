I’m so happy we got married at HMOC!

The Heritage Museum of OC is a beautiful little gem in Santa Ana. My husband and I knew after our first tour of the grounds that this was our wedding venue. We have zero regrets. It’s a gorgeous space! The house is beautiful and the grounds are well maintained year-round. Not only that, but the staff at the museum are so wonderful and easy to work with. Kaitlyn was our venue coordinator and she was fantastic from day one. She answered all of my endless questions throughout the wedding planning process and was always incredibly patient, helpful and kind. She really calmed my nerves the night before and the day of the wedding. The venue was also super flexible with last minute rainstorms. The canopies didn’t take away from how beautiful the venue is. I highly recommend getting married here rain or shine!

Best Day Ever

My wife and I got married on July 14th of this year and let me just say it was THE BEST DAY EVER. Heritage Museum was by our side every step of the way. Jamie made sure the beautiful property was emmaculate on our day and Jenn made sure our ceremony went smoothly and beautifully. You could not ask for a more beautiful venue or genuinely caring staff. Picking Heritage Museum of Orange County was the perfect choice for our day without a doubt.

Wedding Dreams Do Come True! 

HMOC is SO beautiful and the staff are the best! The museum is very affordable for the amount of space and the elegance. Everyone there went above and beyond to make our special day feel unique and completely perfect for me and my husband. Jamie is literally the sweetest person! Between her and Diana at Country Gardens, the two of them kept us sane in the wedding planning process. Jenn and Naomi were super helpful, too! Thank you, HMOC!

HMOC was incredible!!

I can't say enough about Heritage Museum of Orange County! We had our daughters wedding and reception there in November and the venue was all we had hoped for and more!! The grounds were kept impeccably, the venue worked well for all our vendors and we had so many people comment on how beautiful everything was. Working with Jamie and Naomi could not have been more fun and the way they answered every question and met every need was amazing. I would, without hesitation, absolutely recommend HMOC for anyone's wedding and reception...it will forever be a special place to us!

Best Venue

If you're looking for an outdoor rustic venue, then I suggest you stop looking because you've found it. Its such a beautiful location for a wedding especially at night. The staff is just amazing and quick to respond to any questions. I heard about this place through a coworker and I fell in love instantly. It was everything I was looking for. My guests could not stop talking about how beautiful the venue is. I couldn't have asked for more. It was just PERFECT! They do provide you with a choice of two different caters and if I may suggest, go with Country Garden Catering they are incredible!

Outstanding venue! My daughter had her wedding on September 23, 2018 at the Heritage Museum of Orange County in Santa Ana. This location was ideal for the weekend as local businesses are mostly closed and traffic or parking was not a problem. Nestled inside of a business district, once inside all awareness beyond the venue itself is lost ... much like being in Disneyland. The setting is beautiful with Victorian and ranch-like surroundings with endless decorating possibilities. Country Garden Caterers is the exclusive company for this venue and they work together seamlessly. We had 300+ guests and it did not feel crowded at all. The promenade to the gazebo was stunning and right out of a movie. Numerous locations for taking awesome photos. We chose the patio area behind the Kellogg House for the reception and even with the large number of guests, we had ample room for a big dance floor and expedient food buffet service.   
  
We worked with Jamie who is FULL of energy and makes you feel like you’ve known her forever, very kind and welcoming! Pricing was reasonable with a few additional perks to the museum to boot. Staff assistance for the wedding rehearsal and the day of was professional and helpful. Jenn and her assistants knew exactly what needed to be done, when and where, taking much of the stress off our shoulders.   
  
I would gladly recommend the Heritage Museum as wedding and reception site as well as a multi-occasion celebration venue. Thanks you Jamie and Heritage Museum staff.

There are not words to express just how amazing my wedding was on July 14, 2018. From the chandelier adorned gazebo, to the colorful rose garden, to the fresh citrus grove, my husband and I were living all of our wedding dreams. Heritage Museum is a non-profit organization that dedicates its time to educating the community about Orange County history. They provide opportunities for students that are one of a kind. They also just happen to be amazing enough to additionally make wedding dreams come true! Jamie Hiber is a bubbly, hardworking, passionate, and truly "all-in" coordinator who runs weddings and events at the museum. With she and the incredible staff, our wedding was perfection. If you are looking for a beautiful outdoor venue to host your big day then you have found the right place!

I LOVE The Heritage Museum! If your looking for rustic you have found it! There are not many place in the OC that give you this kind of old world feel but Heritage nails it! Plenty of scenic location for pictures to be taken, a lovely gazebo courtyard for the ceremony, lots of other areas for cocktail time and covered patio for reception dinning and open area for dancing. This place is truly like stepping back in time to another place. In addition to the venue the staff is amazing as well. Jamie is awesome! I can't thank them enough for being so professional and accommodating! I fully endorser this venue as one of the best in Orange County! Cheers, DJ Pat

Over the past two years we have photographed many weddings at Heritage Museum of Orange County and it has quickly become one of my favorite venues to shoot at! Their staff is helpful, kind, personable and make you feel like family the second you step on their property! On top of amazing venue staff, the venue lends itself to so many different options of weddings. We have photographed everything from a country chic themed wedding to an elegant black and white affair--and both worked perfectly with the venue. The property truly can adapt to a variety of styles and looks, giving you exactly what you want for wedding day. I could not recommend this venue enough to potential brides!
