Fantastic service! 

Of course, you want everything to go smoothly on your special day, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience than what my husband and I received from Renee at The Drifting Drink! Every detail was taken care of with such professionalism and quality, I felt like every request that was important to us was important for her and she nailed it! My guests were so pleased that many of my friends and family members are interested in her services for their own events! Everything just fell into place. 10/10 all around!

Exceptional Service from The Drifting Drink Mobile Bar!

We hired The Drifting Drink Mobile Bar for our wedding, and it was one of the best decisions we made! Their team went above and beyond to ensure our special day was absolutely unforgettable.  
  
Renee was a joy to work with, she helped us customize a setup and drink menu that perfectly matched our wedding theme. We opted for the BYOB Full Bar Package and the Popsicles and Prosecco Package, they were a huge hit with our guests!  
  
The staff were friendly, professional, and engaging, making sure everyone felt included and had a great time. They were punctual, organized, and handled everything seamlessly, from setup to cleanup. It was such a relief to have one less thing to worry about on such an important day.  
  
A massive thank you to Renee and the entire team for your excellent service and care. You truly made our wedding even more special. If you're looking for a mobile bar service that delivers an amazing experience, look no further, you’ve found the perfect one! Highly recommend. 🥂

I want to share my experience with drifting drink! First of all, Renee is one of the most AMAZING human's i have ever met! She was professional, kind, PATIENT, and most of all, she made our event even more memorable!  
I was a bit skeptical in the beginning, and boy was i wrong!  
i would recommend Drifting Drink for all occasions!   
Our family and friends have used her services since.
