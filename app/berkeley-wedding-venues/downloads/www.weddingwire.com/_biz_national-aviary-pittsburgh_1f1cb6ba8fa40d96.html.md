A beautiful venue that is so unique for your wedding!

The National Aviary is an absolutely GORGEOUS space for your wedding. The Garden Room is absolutely stunning and it is a modern space that really allows you to customize. During your cocktail hour, the Aviary can bring out birds to meet your guests. Sunshine the penguin was the true star of our wedding! The Aviary is obviously an Aviary FIRST and a wedding venue SECOND, so keep that in mind when booking this space. It's worth it, but note, you won't be able to set up early and you have limitations within the space.   
  
I will say that the staff was awesome, it was a lot of moving parts, and they did their best to make everything run smoothly. The forecast on the day of my wedding was low for rain, but about 2 hours beforehand, it looked grim. The Aviary did the herculean task of moving the ceremony indoors with limited time. They set up in the lobby, which I'm told was the first wedding to do so and it was absolutely gorgeous. Brides I highly recommend you use this as the rain plan moving forward.   
  
The most magical space and my guests had so much fun in penguin point.

Amazing experience

The Aviary team, Yvette, Jordyn and Victoria were wonderful to work with. We had all the time we needed to enjoy our daughters special evening. The entire team at the aviary from start to finish worked in a professional manner. We could not have asked for a more perfect event.

Unique place to host a wedding!

The Aviary is a fabulous place to host a wedding! Their event space is just beautiful with the patio, garden area and accordion doors. With half of the guest list being from out of town, the habitats being open during cocktail hour and up close encounter were such a treat for guests! They really turn the place over after they close to the public to make it an elegant event. There are endless options for how to set up your event and have the option of an outdoor or indoor ceremony. The event staff is great to work with ! They were communicative, responsive and helpful in so many ways: when we had outside vendor issues or even deciding last minute to move the ceremony inside due to rain. Their main caterer Atrias was a hit! We’ve been hearing raving reviews about the food since. This was a very affordable venue in the city. Atrias has many food packages and their bar package was very reasonable. I looked at many venues in the city and this was by far the most affordable and very unique ! With all venues there are limits as to what their staff can/can’t do so just read the contract and plan on getting outside help to set up or have a family member assist.

Incredible venue, fantastic team

My wife and I got married here in the summer of 2022. We used the Rose Garden for our ceremony, the Aviary itself for the cocktail hour and the new Garden Room for our reception. The planning team was extremely accommodating, giving us regular updates and checking in for any of our needs. On the day of the wedding, everything was in place at the right time, and our bridal parties were led to where they needed to be when without any hiccups. It was truly a spectacular day, and I'd absolutely recommend the space to anyone getting married soon!

Amazing, Unique Wedding Venue!

We loved having our reception at The National Aviary! They were wonderful to work with. This is a very special place to us, and we loved knowing our money was going to support such a great place. All of our guests loved the uniqueness of the venue and enjoyed the beautiful place and beautiful birds. Our penguin guest just topped off an amazing day. Thank you!!!

Unique wedding venue and we got to celebrate with a penguin :)

We loved our wedding reception at the National Aviary. When we got engaged, we knew we wanted to have our reception at the Aviary. All the staff was great to work with, and all the guests raved about how fun and unique of a venue it was. We were glad that the exhibits were open and gave guests something fun to do. Being able to interact with DJ the penguin was one of the highlights of our wedding. The outdoor garden was beautiful, we hardly had to provide any decorations because the space was so beautiful on its own. All the staff was great to work with, especially Ashley and Yvette, the event coordinators. They were always very responsive and worked with us diligently up until the day of the wedding to make sure everything ran smoothly.

Amazing coordinators and staff 

I was just in awe at how amazing and perfect everything was. Atrias food was just too amazing. We had alot of complements on the food and venue. The guests were loving the aviary experience. So glad everyone was happy. Yvette was just a star to work with she went above and beyond helping clean up and coordinating everything. Ashley was also amazing at getting us information and emailing back and forth answering questions. I loved our wedding. Great weather, great food, great staff.

A Unique and Amazing Experience

This is the ABSOLUTE perfect wedding venue for anyone who wants to give their guests an amazing experience! To begin, it is such a gorgeous space, and it is located next to a park which is another amazing spot for photos. The events planning staff is amazing. Ashley and Laura were so helpful, quick to respond, and go above and beyond to make sure you are comfortable. There was supposed to be an event happening in the park the day of my wedding, and they reached out to the organization to make sure their music and events did not disrupt the wedding. (the event ended up cancelled). The food is also made on site and is one of the best meals I have had! For everything this space provides, it is a steal cost wise
