Artiva Strings is one of our favorite string groups to work with in Utah as professional wedding planners! I’ve seen firsthand how much live music can transform a ceremony or cocktail hour, and these musicians are truly some of the best. They are professional and easy to work with leading up to the wedding as you choose music, decide what size group you want, and they even offer an option to add-on special song requests if there's a song not in their repertoire you want them to learn. If you’re considering live strings for your wedding, this is your group. They elevate a wedding day experience and also are SO easy to work with!

Parris was awesome to work with for our ceremony. His live guitar definitely set the mood and vibe for the entire day. He was so easy to work with and was very quick to respond throughout our entire process. I would book him again in the future for any formal event and recommend him for anyone looking for a guitar player.

Merinda is such an incredible talent! I recently hired her for to play ceremony music at a wedding. I cannot recommend her enough. Her music added the most beautiful, ethereal touch to the ceremony and so many of the guests commented on how magical it felt. She was professional, punctual, and incredibly talented! Whether she was performing classic pieces or more modern selections, everything was seamless and so moving. If you’re looking to elevate your event with something truly special, Merinda is it!

The Maywood String quartet were professionals in every part of the process, their performance quality was excellent, and their rates were very reasonable. Highly recommended if you are looking for a fun and classy musical addition for your wedding day! Matt promptly responded to my inquiry and provided transparent details on pricing and terms. It was easy to confirm a time and date and secure the booking. He continued to be prompt and thorough in communications leading up to the day of the event. He didn't need much from us other than venue details, song selection, and a timeline for the day which was great as we had so many other details to think about and vendors to coordinate. The group has a well-curated repertoire of classical standards and pops songs and we had no problem finding selections we were excited about. Their price list and contract did offer an option to have them learn new songs but we didn't feel the need to ask them to learn anything new. Day-of they arrived on time and were set up and ready to play very quickly. They were professional in appearance and conduct and very self-sufficient. The quality of their performance was excellent. They provided music for our ceremony, cocktail hour, and first dance. They nailed it on all the important moments in the ceremony and first dance and provided lovely background music that created an amazing ambience for the cocktail hour. It was exactly what we were imagining and our guests really enjoyed it.

Two words: Absolute Ripppppper! Kenny was dialed in from our first vetting/intro call. He took on the challenge of infusing the typical bangers with his melodic sax magic and exceeded our expectations by turning the crowd way up during our Persian songs. He did an amazing job coordinating with both us and our DJ, DJ Joune. 12/10, HIGHLY recommend!

My sister wanted a jazz duo. Christian was super responsive. He can essentially play anything, and we gave him a list of some of our favorite old-school jazz songs. He came with an upright bass player. He played our requests and took requests from the audience. Music was danceable. He made a rendition of my sister’s favorite Beatles song I Will which was startlingly good. This guy is funny and kind and you can tell he LOVES to play. He just seemed…happy, to be there playing live for us.
