10/10 Would Recommend Wrennwood Design for ALL of Your Wedding Planning/Design Needs! Trust me, you want Amberly to plan your wedding!:)

Amberly and her team designed our dream wedding in Atlanta, Georgia this past June at Druid Hills Presbyterian Church and THE ROOF at Ponce City Market! From the very first phone call when I was searching for a wedding planner, to the day of our wedding, Amberly stood out to me from all other planners and planning companies!! She was so incredibly genuine, honest, listened to every want/need/idea I had, and so incredibly talented! Amberly started off by sitting down with me and going over my "vision" and simply got to know me as a bride and my style! She then walked me through every step of the planning process, offering the best vendors, ideas, design elements, and expertise! I am typically very type-A and like to plan everything to the tee and with Amberly as our wedding planner, I was 100% at ease, relaxed, laid back, and confident that our wedding would be everything I dreamed because of how helpful, accommodating, and talented her and her team were! Amberly and her team have that special ability to be able to take their creative skills and provide you with a final product that is beyond what you even imagined it could be! Amberly anticipated needs before they were spoken, planned ahead for all possible hiccups, and she kept everyone involved in the planning process at ease and happy throughout the entire process. Wrennwood design isn't interested in selling you on the "most popular" vendors or the "trendiest" things in the wedding space, Amberly simply gets to know you as a bride and her primary interest is in designing a wedding that is YOU and that is beyond what you even express you want! I felt confident in any choice Amberly made and put full trust in her throughout the entire planning process! Down to the littlest of details, Amberly orchestrated and advised us on everything! She has so much experience in this field that she was able to suggest the top tier vendors, give quality advice, help us meet our budget, get the best deals, and had connections all over Atlanta! On top of all of this, she was also our floral designer and my, OH MY! The intricate, delicate, unique, breathtaking design of our flowers was something our guests raved about and still do! I wasn't sure of what types of flowers I wanted or exactly how I wanted them to look, so by giving Amberly a few color ideas, she brought my vision to life! She is truly gifted as a florist and I would 10/10 recommend you use her as your florist! Nothing is impossible with Amberly, she even created the most beautiful flower halo that hung in the center of our dance floor! Needless to say, I will always recommend Amberly, Julia, and her entire team of planners to every Bride I know who is looking for a planning and design team to create the wedding day of their dreams! Thank you WD for blowing me away and for creating such a beautiful day we couldn't have dreamed of!

Stress Free Wedding Planning and Day! 

I got married in April of 2017 and we hired Amberly to help with the rehearsal dinner and wedding. Originally, I had planned on only having someone to help the day of, but after meeting with Amberly and realizing everything she could do to help, we hired her to help plan the whole thing. She handled everything and responded to the millions of phone calls, texts, and emails of questions that we had. While I could never decide what to do about flowers, we decided to hire her for that too, and she made all my dreams come true within our budget! There was no stress through the planning process and on our wedding day and that’s all thanks to Amberly and her team! She became like a family and I would recommend her to anyone getting married!

Thigpen Wedding Carrollton, GA

Amberly and the Wrennwood Design Team gave my wedding the personalized attention we needed. My side of the family was going through a very rough time and we needed someone to come in, call the shots, make the decisions, and just tell us what to do and when to do it. Amberly became a close friend to me during my wedding planning year, and even though we don’t talk much anymore, it meant the world to me for her to make me feel so special. We received this level of service back in 2013 when Wrennwood was just starting up. I can only imagine the beautiful things Amberly has going on now with her amazing business. Getting a wedding planner was a no brainer, but finding Wrennwood Designs was a blessing. Thank you Amberly!

Brought our vision to life & MORE!

We did the design, florist and day of coordinator through Wrennwood Design and our wedding would not have been the same without Amberly & her team!! From the first call I knew that Amberly understood our vision. I shared a few images we liked and she took it from there. The day of our wedding we were supposed to be outdoors but it ended up being cold & rainy (in April!) so we made the decision to move indoors. The way Amberly and her team flipped the room and with all of the design, decor and florals they created for us - it was unreal! We both agreed that we LOVED the look of our ceremony and reception indoors so much we would not even switch it to outdoors if the weather was different. They absolutely nailed our vision - better than we even imagined it! Our guests are still talking about it! THE BEST.

Julia is my Hero!

I cannot say enough amazing things about Julia. The second I got married, I knew I wanted an event coordinator. I did a lot of research and read great reviews about Wrennwood Design. They were the first vendor I booked. They gave me great recommendations for other vendors and I booked a couple from their list. They had a great online tool through Aisle Planner that helped me keep track of my checklist. I didn’t have my first meeting with Julia until we were four months out so I was a little nervous that we had never met. Julia was amazing. She was extremely professional and very direct, which assured me that she could handle my crazy family. I didn’t want an event coordinator who was going to try and appease everyone and Julia was 100% on my side. When I did my first walk through, I was so overwhelmed. Julia quickly picked up on it and broke everything down into baby steps. Whenever I was posed a question where I didn’t care about the answer, she suggested, in her experience, the best decision. That was one of the important reasons I got an event coordinator because I had never planned a wedding before- and they have planned hundreds of weddings! Plus, there were some things I really didn’t care about but wanted advice from someone who knew what they were doing. On the day of, Julia was by my side every step of the way. She handled EVERYTHING. While her main focus was to take care of me and the groom, she also took care of our parents. Jenna was working with her who was also phenomenal. I did not have to worry about a thing on the day of my wedding because it was all handled so well. There were absolutely no hiccups, at least none I was aware of! Even all of my wedding guests talked about how amazing Julia was. WORTH EVERY PENNY. At the end of the wedding, i told Julia I needed to plan another event so I could hire her again. I recommend event coordinators to everyone I know who is getting married. It’s just not worth being so stressed out on the day of your wedding. To anyone in Atlanta- I highly recommend Julia DeBruler and Wrennwood Design. They know what they’re doing and can help make your dreams a reality.

I went with Wrennwood because I really appreciated the phone consultation, where Amberly really demonstrated an interest and understanding in what I was looking for. I also really appreciated that the leftover flowers can be donated. We went with a botanical aesthetic, with lots of greenery and white flowers. I wanted something a little different from all of the other weddings I'd been to, and she nailed it. My bouquet was unusual but beautiful, exactly what I'd wanted. The centerpieces were gorgeous. She also was just all around great to work with. At my walkthrough, I made it clear that I didn't want to make any more decisions about my wedding and asked my vendors to make recommendations instead of asking me questions. Amberly ran with that and delivered beautiful results without stressing me out with endless questions (although she still got my input) and without going over budget.

Words can never express the true appreciation my daughter and I have from the service and companionship we received from Wrennwood Events and the owner Amberly Odem. Amberly's personal touch she placed upon our wedding was out of this world. I told Amberly to use her judgement with my daughter's wishes and just go with it. She did just that. Amberly did all our decorations for the wedding as well as the reception. She was also our wedding planner. I did not have to do any of the planning, we relied on Amberly as I told her I wanted to do, and she took care of us. Our photographer could not take her eyes off of my daughter's (the bride) bouquet, as was evident in all the pictures she took. Amberly has the most unique eye for florals so we took advantage of that and used flowers and greenery as the main décor for the wedding. Again, I can't say enough of this dear lady as a wedding coordinator or designer. She is by far the best

Wrennwood was suggested to us through our planner for design and florals. My partner and I flew in and met with Amberly. She presented us with a full design board based on a few photos we sent her. Her team arrived on the our wedding day and have everything perfectly and flawlessly executed. It was the BEST day of our lives thusfar, and we are so thankful that they made it so beautiful!

We hired Wrennwood to help us with Event Management and Coordination. Julia was our coordinator for our wedding day, although Amberly assisted up until our walk through to make sure everything was flawless. All of our guests had a wonderful time and we were able to sit back and enjoy the day!

We hired Amberly at the recommendation of a friend and past bride that worked with Wrennwood. We can honestly say it was the best money spent. My husband and I work full time jobs and did not have much time to devote to researching vendors. Amberly presented us with vendors that fit within our style and budget and saved us so much time. She is such a sweet person and was always so chill, putting us at ease about the whole process.
