I researched any and every local tent company for my September 2017 wedding. I had my eyes on a sail cloth tent which many companies did not have as an option. Of those that did, the price quoted by ABC rent-a-tent could not be beat. Larger tent companies quoted the same kind and size of tent at thousands more! Not only did ABC offer the best price, the customer service provided by Don was world class. He was very responsive throughout the process and made sure to explain different options and address all my questions. Don even coordinated the dance floor, staging, lighting company and chair rental for me, which was also priced equal or better to separate vendors quotes I received. Don’s team on-site was also great. They arrived on time, worked diligently to set up the tent and were very respectful of the county club property and regulations. I highly recommend ABC rent-a-tent, not only for the high quality and beautiful tent, but also for their professionalism and service. Thank you Don and team!!

We went with New England Tent rentals for our tables and a back up tent at an outside ceremony. George was awesome! The chairs were perfect, and the wine barrels and cocktail tables fit our day and venue perfectly. We didn't end up needing the large tent because the weather was beautiful so we didn't end up having to pay for the rest of the tent after our initial deposit which many other places we looked at don't do. One newer employee of New England Tent called me the day before my wedding (me being the bride) to let me know if anything is damaged I have to pay for it which is obviously stated in the contract. This was definitely unappreciated, but she was new and looking out for her company.

Quality Rental was perfect. Knowledgable, professional, understanding and all around great people. Easily reduced the stress of planning my son's rehearsal dinner outdoors and having to make weather related decisions at the last minute. They are every bit as good as the other big name rental company, but half the price and much more reasonable and flexible on deposits and last minute changes. I'm booking them again for my daughter.

Our daughters wedding had to be cancelled due to COVID pandemic. Newport Tent opted to return 100% of our deposit without hesitation. We were so grateful that they chose to do the right thing, unlike the band we hired - Sugar- who chose to keep our $2500 deposit. I would highly recommend bringing your business to the vendors that opted NOT to take advantage during a global crisis. Thank you Newport Tent!

We hired David and his team for piping, draping, chair covers, and chair sashes for a wedding at the East Greenwich Veteran's Club. It was amazing to see how beautifully they transformed the room for our happy couple :) As an Event Planner, Designer, and Florist -- dependable, trustworthy, affordable, friendly, and professional vendors for our clients is of utmost importance. And we were very happy that we hired them for this particular wedding. We look forward to the next time we do business with you guys :)

I Do Details provided me with chair covers and sashes for my wedding reception. Melissa was wonderful to work with and the room looked beautiful once she was done with it! She set them up and picked them up the next day, which helped me out a lot. I highly recommend I Do Details!

Gigi was extremely helpful as we planned our wedding with 70 guests. She foresaw a lot of details that we would need to figure out in the planning process to make sure our day would go as smoothly as possible. She also was accommodating in changes that we made to our plans along the way. We had food delivered from a restaurant to save money, and Extra Hands provided people to set up dinner tables, decorations, and the set up for the buffet, as well as the teardown and cleanup. Extra Hands also provided a bartender who did an amazing job! We provided our own alcohol – beer, wine, and ingredients for three signature cocktails. The Extra Hands bartender Tina did extremely well with our vague instructions for the cocktails (we provided a lot of ingredients without specific ratios, and she nailed the ratio better than we would have). Everyone kept complimenting one of the cocktails she made. It was hands-off for us as the bride and groom. Highly recommended!

Tim from Liberty Rentals was great to work with. He was flexible, accommodating, and gave his honest opinion. We rented the tent and some cocktail tables and chairs to augment what our venue provided for our wedding reception. Everything was delivered as promised. I would highly recommend Tim and Liberty Rentals for your event.
