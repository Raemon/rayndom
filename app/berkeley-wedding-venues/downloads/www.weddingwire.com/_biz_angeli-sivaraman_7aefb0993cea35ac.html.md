Private wedding Ceremony

Angeli was everything we hoped for in a wedding officiant.  
She brought the perfect balance of empathy, depth, and humor to our ceremony. From start to finish, she was professional, thoughtful, and incredibly easy to work with. Her presence made our day even more meaningful

Special Person

Angeli is a person of integrity, warmth, and genuine kindness. Her ability to connect with people and make them feel comfortable is truly remarkable. These are qualities that I believe are crucial for creating a memorable and heartfelt wedding ceremony.  
  
In addition to her interpersonal skills, Angeli is highly organized and detail-oriented. She approaches every task with dedication and professionalism. I am confident that Angeli will bring a personal touch and a sense of joy to any wedding ceremony she officiates. I wholeheartedly recommend her for this special role. ❤️
