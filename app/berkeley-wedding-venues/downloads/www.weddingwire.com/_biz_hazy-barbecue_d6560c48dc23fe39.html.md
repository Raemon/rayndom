highly recommend!!!!

Hazy BBQ was hands down one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. After meeting with Sean, the owner, I immediately told my husband, my fiancé at the time, that I wanted to work with them. Sean is one of the most genuine, down-to-earth people, and from the very first meeting we felt completely comfortable.  
  
Even though he knew we were ready to give them our business, Sean never rushed us and was incredibly easy to work with throughout the entire process. The Hazy team handled everything related to food preparation and setup, and even provided the drink buckets and ice, which was such a huge help and one less thing for us to worry about.  
  
And the food. The food was absolutely exceptional. Our guests LOVED it, and my husband and I are big foodies, so having phenomenal food at our wedding was very important to us. Hazy BBQ more than delivered. We have already gone back several times since the wedding, and it is just as amazing every time.  
  
We are so appreciative of Sean and the entire Hazy BBQ team for being so wonderful to work with and for helping make our wedding day unforgettable. Highly, highly recommend.

A Perfect Wedding Rehearsal Dinner

I highly recommend Hazy Barbecue for your catered event. We recently hosted our daughter's wedding rehearsal dinner at their beautiful space in downtown Danville. Tami and their catering team are very easy to work with – quick to respond, professional and friendly. The food is amazing! Many of our guests were from Texas and were impressed by the quality of their brisket. I can confidently recommend them for your catering needs and promise you will not be disappointed!!

Amazing Food from Hazy Barbecue

Hazy Barbecue was amazing at our daughter's wedding – the food was delicious, incredibly affordable and generously portioned. My daughter and now son-in-law love BBQ, however, there are not a lot of great options in the SF Bay Area. I personally visited and tasted food from 13 established restaurants and caterers and luckly, Hazy opened up in Danville, our town, just in time. The theme of the wedding was not country or western, we just wanted food that we love and something we knew would satisfy our guests--and Hazy came through. Tami and her team were very easy to work with, before and during the event, always very responsive and gave close attention to small details. As with any caterer, be sure to outline all of your needs, ask questions about everything from staffing, set-up and break-down so that you have your expectations met, like we did. We were their first off-premise catered event, fully staffed, so our 4-star rating on service is only because the obviously had room for growth since this was their first event after launching the catering side of their business. Our friends and family truly enjoyed the food and raved about the brisket, pulled pork and the side dishes. Highly recommend you consider Hazy for your special event. I'll visit their restaurant every time I am back in town!
