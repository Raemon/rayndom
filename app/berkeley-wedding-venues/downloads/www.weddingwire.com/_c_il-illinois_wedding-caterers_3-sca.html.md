I’ve been to several of their pop ups whether it’s literally in a middle of a glass field or as a vendor popping up and Estelle and her team are incredibly kind/inviting but also produce some of the best drinks I’ve ever had with their house-made syrups you’re not getting Tourani sugar cups, you’re getting thought out cafe-grade drinks that will have you seeking out their pop ups throughout the city!

We have absolutely nothing but wonderful things to say about Catered by Design. Rachel was helpful and responsive whenever we had questions. The food was INCREDIBLE and guests from our wedding have told us countless times that the food was to die for. Everything from the cook on the food to the presentation, to the plating was everything we could've wanted for our wedding. If you are looking for a caterer, this is the only one you should even consider. They are phenomenal and you wont be disappointed.

We hired Connie's for our wedding on 3/25/23 and they exceeded our expectations! We had a simple menu with pizza, salad, and pasta. Our guests RAVED about the food and said how delicious it was! We worked closely with JoAnn and she was awesome. She took all of our requests into consideration and made them happen. Would definitely recommend if you and your partner love pizza and are looking for a simple and affordable meal for your wedding!

We had our wedding at Lacuna Lofts, which meant we had the absolute pleasure of having LM Catering as our wedding caterer. We had so many friends and family members compliment the dinner and dessert table, saying that this was “actually delicious wedding food”! We had a number of dietary restrictions, and LM’s vast menu and options made it so easy to accommodate everyone’s needs while also making everything taste DELICIOUS! Everything was presented beautifully, and we particularly loved that the sides were served family-style, which we hadn’t seen at many weddings before. We made some changes to our picks numerous times, and Tania was so accommodating in making any and all changes we requested! Our dessert table and yummy pretzel late night snacks were huge hits with our guests, and being able to get everything – dinner, dessert, and snacks – from one vendor was so seamless. We would highly recommend LM to anyone looking for a tasty, fun wedding caterer!

My husband and I were impressed with Beyond’s transparency, professionalism, and flexibility. The food surpassed our high standards and is still talked about among our guests. Remedy was a pleasure to work with and was very generous with her time to ensure all questions and concerns were addressed.

We catered from Sabri for my daughter’s multi cultural wedding and everyone loved to food. Safdar was amazing to work with and helped us choose the perfect menu. There was so much food left over we had guest take trays home. The food was so good we are planning to go back to the restaurant for dinner. One recommendation for this restaurant to allow people booking a wedding to offer a tasting.

Juliana and her team did a wonderful job from start to finish. The tasting was well executed, the planning was well thought out, and the day of execution was flawless. I cannot recommend Cocina Fusion and Juliana enough for those couples looking for a peace of mind and amazing food!

Jewell provided excellent food and service. Our wedding had to be postponed and they worked hard to make sure we got the food we originally ordered at the original price. I really appreciated their hard work and everything was delicious.

We are so glad we chose Polonia as our caterer for our wedding! They were extremely helpful and courteous in choosing our food menu and planning our seating arrangements. It was great to be able to go through 1 vendor for almost all of the necessities for an outdoor wedding. The food was delicious and hot, even with their 1 hour commute to the venue. Would definitely recommend!

From the very first tasting, we knew My Chef Catering was the right choice for our wedding—and they absolutely did not disappoint! The dual entrée we chose was incredible: Chicken Francaise with Lemon Caper Cream and Bistro Steak with Shallot Port Reduction, accompanied by perfectly cooked Grilled Broccolini and Smashed Redskin Potatoes with Garlic Butter. Every bite was delicious, and even our picky family members devoured their meals, saying it was the best they’d ever had. Our guests continue to rave about the food—so much so that some are begging for the chicken recipe! The hors d’oeuvres were equally amazing. We loved having a tray set aside just for us during cocktail hour, featuring Italian Sausage Cherry Pepper Poppers, Mini Crab Cakes with Cajun Remoulade, Tuscan Skewers, and Rustic Pistachio Crostini with Whipped Ricotta and Orange Marmalade. And the perks of being the bride? I got my own special meal! I had been looking forward to it as the wedding day approached—Chilean Sea Bass with Citrus Cream Beurre Blanc, Orzo tossed with Herbs and Roasted Garlic, and a Grilled Vegetable Melange (Zucchini, Yellow Squash, Red and Green Peppers tossed with Grill Seasonings). I just wish my wedding nerves allowed me to savor it fully! The dessert table completely wowed our guests—they discovered the entire finger sweets table and couldn’t stop raving about it. Every detail, from presentation to flavor, was perfect. The service was exceptional. Jaime and the entire staff were kind, attentive, and continuously checked on us throughout the night, making sure we were comfortable and everything was running smoothly. They even contributed to our table scapes, adding finishing touches like folding our napkins into gorgeous “flower” designs that perfectly complemented the décor. Overall, working with My Chef was seamless, stress-free, and truly enjoyable. Jaime is incredible, professional, and such a joy to collaborate with. We cannot recommend My Chef enough for anyone looking for amazing food, impeccable service, and a team that will go above and beyond to make your day perfect!
