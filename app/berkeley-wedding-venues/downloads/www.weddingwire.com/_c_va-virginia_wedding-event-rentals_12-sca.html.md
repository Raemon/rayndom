5.0 out of 5 rating 

5.0 

At first i was a little skeptical about getting everything wrapped up through one vendor as i normallt try to cut costs in favor of leg work. But when the day came and everything was set up for us, im so happy we went with Curated. Granted, they forgot some parts so it stalled set-up time, but nevertheless the tables, chairs, tent, etc, everything was absolutely beautiful. The decor helped make our wedding vision into a reality and the ease of a one-stop-shop at Curated made it all so easy.

I cannot say enough wonderful things about Francisco Display Fireworks and the incredible job they did for my daughter’s wedding. From start to finish, everything was handled with professionalism, care, and genuine enthusiasm for making the evening unforgettable. The fireworks display was absolutely breathtaking and perfectly timed, creating a magical moment that left my guests in awe. It was the highlight of the night and a beautiful way to celebrate such a special occasion. The team was organized, safety-conscious, and seamless to work with, which gave me complete peace of mind. Thank you, Francisco Display Fireworks, for helping make my daughter’s wedding truly spectacular. I will forever cherish the memories you helped create and would highly recommend your services to anyone looking to add a “wow” factor to their special event.

FDS tents was great to work with. Our venue had a permanent tent that FDS installed, and they were in charge of all add-ons. They are highly professional and responsive, and installed the tent add-ons we'd ordered well in advance.

We used the Prop Shop for all of our wedding rentals. KJ was great to work with and made sure that we had everything we needed for our special day to be perfect. It ended up raining alllll day so the big tent and side walls were great to have. We actually got married under the tent on the dance floor due to the rain and the lights inside the tent made everything so romantic. The dance floor was a hit and everybody was busting some moves on it and some point during the night!

Commonwealth Events was wonderful to work with for our farmhouse backyard wedding this fall! They were so accommodating of my many questions and revisions and changes and extremely professional when it came to the tent installation. Our tent and lighting was beautiful and Kim worked with me to design a table layout and band stage/dance floor setup that worked perfectly for our event. I can't reiterate how easy it was to work with them to plan our event!

We rented sound equipment and hired a technician to set-up the sound equipment and take it down for our self-DJ wedding in October 2019. Working with Aviva was very easy and I appreciated that we were not forced to hire someone to "man" the equipment throughout the event, since that saved us some money. The equipment worked beautifully and we had zero issues throughout the day! Carol was very responsive over email and the technician, Mike, was professional. I would definitely recommend them as a great option if you want to self-DJ!

Things looked exactly how we wanted them, and they didn't charge us for things we didn't use. We got two tents, lots of tables and chairs, lights, and a dance floor. They were very easy to work with. Our caterer also rented the dishware through Aztec.
