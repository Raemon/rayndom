Hannah was seriously FABULOUS. She is a joy to have on your special day. She is a blast and funny and makes you feel valued and beautiful! She really listened to me and recreated my Pinterest inspo pic perfectly!!!!! Which is saying so much since she blended pink, orange, purple, gold and white shimmer all on just one tiny eyelid! She even bought a new pallet just for what I wanted. I will highly recommend her for everyone. Her hair stylist, Austin, pinned each curl perfectly to create Hollywood waves that stayed for HOURS in 105 degree summer heat!!!!! I cannot thank you all enough. All my girls raved about it and we felt so pampered. Hannah was communicative through Instagram and email, her prices are fair, the trial was fun, and her timing on the day was planned wonderfully.

Jaclyn at STLooks did my hair, my mom's hair, and my sister's hair for my wedding on April 30, 2022. Jaclyn was so professional and kind. She listened to exactly what we each wanted, and everyone was so happy with their results. She did a trial of my hair a few months out which was great and allowed me to not worry when it came to the big day. She also had a wonderful waiting area in her salon where we could hang out while the other person was getting their hair done and she provided us with some snacks and mimosas which was really going above and beyond. She got all of us in and out in about 2 hours which is just what we had planned, causing no delays in our getting ready schedule. Jaclyn was so wonderful and I absolutely recommend her for your wedding hair needs!

This place is very accommodating with adding or changing. We were able to add on two girls 5 months before the wedding. Also the prices here beat a lot of others when it comes to hair and makeup. They have a room there for the bridal party to be in, in between the girls getting ready. Brianna did my hair and she did AMAZING. I found a video of a hairstyle I wanted she watched the video and practiced doing the style before I was there getting ready. She made my hair exactly how I envisioned it! My makeup was good. She had to fix it a couple times because black stuff got on my face after she airbrushed me and my eye makeup was good not quite how I wanted it but still beautiful. The reason for 4 stars is because it took so long for her to Finish my makeup I ran 30 minutes behind. I was told we would be done before noon and I was not done till 12:30. If it was going to run late they should have done my makeup before one of the other girls so I could have met the photographer at the venue. But overall really good experience other than the time delay.

Robin has done my hair and makeup for my engagement photos, wedding, and baby shower. And had always done a wonderful job! She does a good job looking at the picture I have selected and then making it work for my face and hair.

Heather did my makeup for my maid of honor, my mom and mother-in-law, and me. We were all so happy with how beautiful and NATURAL the makeup looked. We did not want to look like makeup was caked on and fake. She glammed us just the right amount so it looked like us but up a few notches. We all felt so beautiful. Thank you!!!

Heer did an amazing job with my bridal makeup for my Indian-American fusion wedding. We started with a trial, where she took her time so I could pick out each part of the look. She was also very responsive to my feedback so we could figure out exactly what I wanted. I didn't feel pressured into anything, which is so refreshing with wedding vendors. Communication before the big day was great. On the wedding day, she perfected the look and was able to complete my entire wedding party's hair and makeup on time. I even changed what hair style I wanted on the day of and she still did a fantastic job! Would highly recommend.

Melissa and Alison were amazing. They made us all feel beautiful and we looked good too! Alison allowed me to pivot from my trial and Melissa made my makeup even prettier than when we did the trial! I whole heartedly recommend Elegance Salon to anyone looking in STL.
