Beautiful Beach Wedding

Working with Eventeriors helped take the stress out of wedding planning. My day was perfect, everything was beautiful, and Jacqueline really brought my dream beach wedding to life. I would recommend Eventeriors to anyone.

Fantastic Event Planner

Jacqueline is an amazing planner and has an extraordinary eye for design and decor. I am so happy with her work for my parents 50th Wedding Anniversary. Everything was absolutely amazing and many people could not stop talking about how beautiful everything was. It was quite an event.
