Highly Recommend! 

We had the absolute pleasure of working with Justice Jacklyn Stockhamer for our wedding, and she was incredible. From the start, she was warm, attentive, and genuinely invested in making our ceremony reflect who we are as a couple.  
She stayed in close touch throughout the planning process, was flexible with our location, and arrived on the day with a calm, reassuring presence that immediately put us at ease. The ceremony felt deeply personal, heartfelt, and beautifully delivered.  
We truly can’t recommend Justice Jackie enough. Her care and professionalism made our day unforgettable.

May Wedding!

Justice Stockmayer officiated my son and daughter in laws wedding in May, she was beyond helpful, has patience of a saint, and would do anything to make sure you had your special day and that it was perfect! She stayed late for us due to a few wedding glitches and never rushed us or complained about the wait. Thank you so much, I would 100% recommend her for anyone’s wedding!

Quick, Easy and Reaponsive!

We had a wonderful experience with Justice Jackie Stockhamer as our wedding officiant. From the start, she made everything incredibly quick and easy, which took a lot of stress off our shoulders. What stood out most was her thoughtfulness!  
  
Jackie went above and beyond by meeting us halfway from Longmeadow, MA (we were coming from Middlesex County), which we truly appreciated. We were unfamiliar with the agreed location to meet up and she was extremely kind in also suggesting a beautiful area for the ceremony and even recommended a great nearby restaurant to celebrate afterward.  
  
We’re so grateful to have had her as part of our special day and would wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone looking for an officiant who wants something personalized and tailored even if it’s simple.
