In January, we went to Puerto Rico for my older sister's wedding. At first, it was like any traditional wedding, but after dinner, the atmosphere changed completely. All the lights went out, and the DJ started his Ibiza-style opening, quickly getting everyone dancing! From the moment he started, the dance floor emptied only to refill drinks and get everyone dancing again. DJ Ironik is 100% a YES person.

Joshua has been our DJ in all our activities for the past four years. He is reliable, professional and also really nice. The music he plays is great, he mixes live and the crowd loves him. He has modern equipment and offers variety of services. I recommend DJ Joker! You will no regret it.

Exactly what we were looking for! I wanted a mix of both Spanish and English music and they did an amazing job with both!

We used their DJ services for our wedding and we liked them so much that I hired them for a corporate event as well. They are very professional, organized and will deliver exactly what you ask for. Highly reliable. 100% recommended for any event!

From our very first emails, DJ Eric’s communication was clear, professional, and genuinely caring. He listened to what we wanted and guided us with confidence every step on the way. On the wedding day, he created an incredible vibe, even our family members who usually don’t party, were on the dance floor! If you want great energy, smooth communication, and a DJ who reads the room perfectly, DJ Eric is your guy.

Dealing with my wedding wasn’t easy. Our venue messed up pretty bad which threw the whole flow off but DJ XMix was so flexible with us even when it got frustrating and he kept the energy high. Really grateful for him and in particular his MC, who was so kind and friendly and helped me feel at ease as a bride. Very grateful for these gentlemen! HIRE THEM! They’ll be the best vendor at your wedding, I guarantee it.
