Beautiful Day

Lucinda (Cindy) was wonderful. Her communication was superb. She helped us tweak our vows to include a blended family sand ceremony and a memorial mention of our deceased parents. Her kindness and thoroughness was much appreciated making our special day perfect. I would highly recommend Cindy.

Just Perfect!

Cindy was the friendliest, professional but down to earth officiant. She met us way in advance with options of her own and open to suggestions before we even agreed to have her officiate. She had multiple vows/ceremonies available to look over. This alone made us choose her! We chose the sand ceremony. She was very knowledgeable and stayed in touch throughout the process up until the wedding day. She made everything seem so simple and easy. 10/10 recommend!!

The Sweetest Elopement with Cindy! 

From the moment my fiancé and I reached out to Cindy, she was in constant communication and helped us design the perfect ceremony for our intimate elopement at the beach. We love how comfortable we felt talking with her and sharing our story of how we met. She made our day so special, and the ceremony itself was seamless and so meaningful. Thank you, Cindy!!

Cindy is so great!

Cindy was so awesome. She showed up from the very first phone call with patience and ease to help us create a beautiful ceremony that we will remember forever! She even showed up on our wedding day in the midst of a hurricane warning, that turned out to be just a scare and an incredible day! Thank you so much for everything Cindy!

Great ceremony 

Cindy was great! We had a small beach ceremony. Cindy offered the idea of a sand ceremony. We had never heard of this before but it was perfect - exactly what we didn’t know we needed. Cindy was a true pleasure to work with. Highly recommend!

Awesome and easy!

Lucinda from Weddings by Design was the perfect choice for us on our wedding day. She helped us through choosing what our ceremony would look like and took time to get to know us and our stories so that we would have a truly personalized wedding. The day of the wedding was pretty hectic but she was a big help by being ready to go and finding the ceremony location through all the chaos. Thank you Lucinda!
