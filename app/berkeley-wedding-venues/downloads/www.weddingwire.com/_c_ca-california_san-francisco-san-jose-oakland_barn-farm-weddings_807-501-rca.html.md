We were very happy with our experience with the Wedgewood team. Even though you interact with different people every time, they are all experts at weddings and can guide you through the process. They were very responsive and quickly answered all our questions and weird requests. They give you a planning binder and schedule regular checkpoints to ensure you are making progress. Overall, they made the process enjoyable and less stressful.

I got married in September 2025, and the whole day was absolutely amazing. From initial conversations with Marina all the way to the final day-of details, Marina was organized, considerate, and an overall pleasure to work with. Her organized planning document and phone calls helped me feel heard and on top of things! She helped my wedding vision come to life! The venue itself is beautiful and it was the perfect space to accommodate 160 guests. The food and drinks were fantastic, and there were many options for every dietary need. Rancho Nicasio's crew and sound tech were all so kind and professional. There is a bridal cottage on site that my bridesmaids and I had access to the morning of the wedding. This made getting ready and seeing the venue come together easy and relaxing. Our wedding day was the best day of my life, and Rancho Nicasio played a huge role in that!

We wanted to have a fairly non-traditional ceremony and reception, Long Branch was amazing to work with! We especially appreciated all the activities and fun things for our guests to do :) Instead of a cake we ordered some local pastries to go with Long Branch's amazing home made ice cream! They did a good job with everything and were so flexible, I can't think of a single thing we asked about that they said no - instead they were always trying to find fun, creative ways to say yes. They have a perfect driveway to park two food trucks, and we really wanted to have amazing food at our wedding - they helped us pull it off!

Words really can't describe just how highly we recommend Green Oaks Creek Farm. We had an unforgettable time planning and hosting our wedding at this magical place. If you have the opportunity to host an event at this venue, you will surely walk away, as we did after our wedding, in complete awe of the property, owners & staff, and experience overall. The owners, Stephanie and Paul, are extremely responsive and accommodating, and invited us to visit GOCF whenever we needed leading up to our wedding to coordinate with other vendors. They were so pleasant to work with from the moment we first emailed to the moment we hugged goodbye! The space: The property is breathtaking, with several different terraces that have their own unique spaces and vibes. From the upper terrace where we held our ceremony, you can look over the pacific ocean while shaded by tall eucalyptus trees. In the garden, you can relax on the grass and meander through the lovingly curated garden beds. A short stroll bordered by garden beds (which were bursting with dahlias at the time of our wedding in October) and you'll arrive at the reception area which is open, well-manicured, and also gives priceless views of the ocean, the surrounding meadows, and flower beds. GOCF also offers rental of numerous dwellings on the property. We took advantage of a package that included all three rentals for 2 nights. They were very clean, stylish, and stocked with everything you may need for a special weekend. Other awesome GOCF offerings: The owners clearly love and meticulously care for the land here. In the garden and in the reception area there are very large (and very stunning) live-edge bar tables made from reclaimed wood from the property. The reception area also has many smaller live-edge reclaimed wood cocktail tables. The hosts also provided as many wood benches as we needed for the ceremony space. It was awesome that we didn't need to rent seating for the ceremony space! The reception area also has a beautiful stone dance floor, an awesome fire pit which Stephanie and Paul provided wood for AND lit for us both the night before and night of our wedding. Edison string lights are hung all throughout the reception area and the walkways throughout the property are well lit. There is also a kitchen space in the reception area that was easily accessible to our caterers and was available for us to use the night before our wedding to host our rehearsal dinner. Being a working flower farm, we also highly recommend purchasing flowers directly from the farm! It was so cool to have flowers in our bouquets and vases that had been picked just steps away. Their prices are very reasonable and they had a fantastic variety. GOCF provided for us our dream quintessential coastal California wedding. Go check it out and you’ll see why it’s so, so uniquely special.

Stemple Creek was an astonishingly great venue. Katie, the event coordinator, is so easy to work with, and deeply knowledgeable about the space and how it can be used. We were particularly impressed with the on-site accommodations, which were great for bringing together close friends and family for our wedding weekend. Everyone loved the scenic grounds and beautiful barn, which are brilliantly set up for wedding usage.

Green Acres Ranch & Wedding Venue in Montara is pure magic, and I cannot say enough amazing things about both the property and its incredible owner, Sylver. From the moment we first visited the ranch, Sylver’s warmth, professionalism, and genuine passion for what she does were undeniable. She has an exceptional eye for detail—things I never would’ve thought of, she had planned out in advance. Every question was answered quickly, every concern put at ease, and every step of the process felt smooth and stress-free because of her. The venue itself is breathtaking. The ranch-style setting is the perfect blend of coastal charm and rustic elegance. The open spaces, natural beauty, and peaceful atmosphere create a backdrop that feels cinematic. Every corner of the property is thoughtfully maintained, and it truly feels like a private oasis. What stood out the most, though, was Sylver’s care and attentiveness. She goes above and beyond—guiding you through planning, offering helpful suggestions, and making sure the entire experience feels effortless. Her communication is always clear, prompt, and kind. You feel supported the entire way, and on the wedding day, you can tell she takes genuine pride in making everything perfect. Our wedding at Green Acres Ranch was unforgettable. Guests couldn’t stop talking about how stunning the venue was and how smoothly everything ran. If you’re looking for a place that’s beautiful, welcoming, and run by someone who truly cares, look no further. Thank you, Sylver, for giving us the wedding of our dreams. Green Acres Ranch isn’t just a venue—it’s an experience we’ll cherish forever

We could not have asked for a more perfect wedding venue to make our special day flawless! Kilham Farm staff was extremely accommodating and flexible yet very stress-free to work with. They made sure our every wish became a reality. We not only got our pick of their multiple venue locations for the ceremony and reception but were welcomed like family and allowed to take photos throughout the stunning and scenic property. They had unique and helpful suggestions for beautiful local areas where we could take day before and after photos. We always dreamed of having an outdoor wedding venue but could not have hoped for such a perfect wedding ceremony and reception. Planning for an outdoor California June wedding although low risk of rain it was very nice having the reassurance that we could move the whole event to their spacious indoor arena or picturesque Mission Style Barn. The facilities were very accommodating and easily hosted our nearly 200 guests without feeling at all crowded. With gentle rolling hills, historic church, horses, creek, pond, and grassy pastures we could not have asked for more!

My husband and I got married at the Pie Ranch back in 2022, and it was such a beautiful experience that I've been meaning to write a review ever since. The event coordinator at Pie Ranch did an amazing job responding to our questions and advising on finding local vendors. Their recommended chef was outstanding. The highlights include a ceremony site overlooking fields and the ocean, a meadow for dining, and a barn for dancing. There is also a delightful, twinkle-lit space in front of the barn with optional heaters, which meant that those who had mobility issues or concerns about COVID could have a wonderful time without having to step inside.

We could not rave about our venue more! We got married in September at Carrington Manor and have since received compliment after compliment about the venue. Our coordinator said it had the best flow of a venue in the Bay Area that they’ve ever worked with. There were different areas for the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception which made things flow well and guests knew where to be. We hardly needed florals considering the greenery on the estate was stunning and came out beautifully in our pictures! The inside barn area for dancing worked so well with our band as well. There was beautiful lighting already supplied by the venue and they were amazing to work with!
