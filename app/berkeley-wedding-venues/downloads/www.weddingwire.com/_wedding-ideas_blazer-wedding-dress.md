For the fashion-forward bride, the non-traditional bride, or a unique prewedding look, consider wearing a blazer wedding dress. Known for their sleek, well-tailored silhouettes inspired by classic menswear, blazer dresses are a sophisticated take on modern wedding style if you're not into the typical little white dress. They're popular for [city hall weddings](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/courthouse-wedding-dresses), [elopements](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/want-to-elope), and wedding-related events, like the engagement party, bachelorette party, [bridal shower](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/bridal-shower-dress-where-to-buy), rehearsal dinner, and brunch sendoff. Ready to shop this trendy look? Check out the chic options we've found below. 

## Cream Wrap Blazer Dress

Most blazer wedding dresses have an oversized, boxy silhouette, so the tie waist on this style already sets it apart. The cream color, plunging neckline and stretch woven fabric are also elements that will keep you comfortable but fashionable.
