Videography for a wedding is an investment but ABSOLUTELY worth it. Everyone I know who chose not to have a videographer at their wedding regretted it and everyone who had a videographer said it was the best thing they ever did. I AGREE. Our teaser video and our full length 9 minute video are stunning. I couldn’t have imagined a better video than the one Nico produced. Nico was a joy to work with from the beginning – he was responsive, patient with our multiple questions and very clear in his communication. When we met the day of the wedding he was friendly, had a very calming presence and he blended in seamlessly. Ultimately, the final product blew us away and we are so happy we chose him to be our videographer. We highly recommend him to everyone!

Christina and George were absolutely incredible to work with! They brought such professionalism, friendliness, and creative energy to our wedding day. Their attention to detail was outstanding — every moment felt thoughtfully captured. I truly appreciated their clear direction and artistic vision throughout the day, which made us feel relaxed and confident in front of the camera. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a talented and dedicated videography team who genuinely cares about their craft and their couples.

Elliot and Chas blew our expectations out of the water with their work on our wedding! They were so kind and thoughtful during the planning process and helped us build the vision for what our wedding video could look like. They perfectly captured our personalities and the joy of our wedding day in the video they put together for us. Honestly out of all the vendors for our wedding, they won for best in show in our book!

We were debating whether or not we needed video when we first met Colin. Let me tell you, working with Featherstone wedding films was one of the best decisions we could have ever made! Colin and his second shooter Danny are incredibly talented and true professionals. They worked so well with our photographer that my family thought they were from the same team.&nbsp; Colin in particular is deeply kind, intuitive, and communicative. He helped turn overwhelming moments into happy memories. Now, let’s get to the footage. WOW. They captured not just the beauty of our day, but the essence of how it felt. All of the little details and funny moments are accounted for, and he was so responsive to any requests or changes. I can’t wait to experience these memories over and over again!

Uncommon Weddings made our wedding video experience incredibly easy. Sway was very connected with us every step of the way. He provided good tips and insights as we were getting closer to our big day and gave us updates frequently. Cesar was our lead videographer on our big day and he crushed it! We are very pleased with all our videos and must say the prices were very reasonable when compared with others.

Hiring EJ and his father was the best decision we made! They are amazingly talented people and they are so kind and down to earth! They made us feel at ease on our wedding day and we enjoyed hanging out with them. They made it seem like we were hanging out with friends. A few days after the wedding, EJ sent us some photos and videos he took with his iphone. Not only were they great photos, but how sweet was that?! They made sure to capture everything we wanted and the results were phenomenal! So far we have received the highlight video, and WOW! We were both amazed at the video they created. It flows so perfectly with the song choice and captures the entire day. We are so happy that we hired Reel Motions and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for high quality work and individuals who are fun to work with. We can't wait to see the rest of the video footage!

Choosing Redwood Reverie to capture our day was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. From start to finish our experience working with them was AMAZING! Their team was very professional and kind and blended into the day seamlessly. The quality of the video, editing, and music chosen made our wedding film truly perfect and will allow us to relive the magic of the day forever. My sister will also be using them to capture the magic of her day!
