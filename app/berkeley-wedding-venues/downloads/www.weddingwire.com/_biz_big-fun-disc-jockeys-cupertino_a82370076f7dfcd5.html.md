We loved Henry!

Henry DJ'ed our wedding and really went above and beyond. From our first call, he was extremely diligent in figuring out what we were looking for, documenting every detail, and explaining every part of how he would fit in to our big day. When we had a few extra questions and request in the weeks leading up to the day, Henry was extremely responsive and worked with us with all the extra details to make them happen. He even had great suggestions and clarifications to make sure we were getting exactly what we wanted. When the day arrived, everything came together like a well oiled machine. All of the logistics of different locations went off without a hitch, and when the dance floor opened up, we kept having our guests come up to us and tell us how awesome the DJ and the dance floor were. Wish we could get married again to book Henry again!

Nestldown, Indian wedding

We worked with Woody for our July 2025 wedding at Nestldown. He went above and beyond for our wedding day, keeping the pace of the day moving with the right ambience. The dance floor was SUCH a highlight -- everyone had a great time. He was also really easy to coordinate with in advance of the wedding -- gave clear direction on what he needed from us, and kept things organized. I also really appreciate the way he supported us when one of our other musicians (unrelated to Big Fun) were being difficult last minute. It was a stressful moment and Woody had my back, encouraging them to stick with the plan. Everything went off without a hitch. Thanks again!!!

We love big fun!

Big Fun DJs was literally a blessing from heaven!!! DJ Paul diligently communicated with us and was attentive and responsive to all of our questions and concerns. He was also organized and checked in about all sorts of details that we would not even have thought to bring up. He even made a custom edit of a song for our parent dances. The set up was seamless and everyone loved the smoke machine and lights. The dance floor was full throughout the night -- Paul even got everyone up and dancing to my parents' wedding song (an older song for sure)! We gave him a bunch of really diverse songs on our must play list and he seamlessly transitioned between them. Big Fun stuck the landing. Put your trust in Paul - he's the man! -Shelby & Miguel (happy newlyweds)

Thanks, Henry!

We had such an incredible experience with Big Fun Disc Jockeys! We had top notch communication from the start of the process to the end. It was extremely impressive how quick and thoughtful their responses were. I’d like to shout out Henry in particular for his professionalism and communication, who came recommended by our venue. Everything behind the scenes was extremely seamless. The day of, he included all our favorite songs, pronounced everyone’s names correctly as the MC, and kept everything flowing with an upbeat and fun nature. We got a lot of compliments! Thank you again for helping make our special night so perfect. We know it took a village and we are so grateful that we chose the best of the best to help us achieve the most special day of our lives.

Big fun thanks to great vibes!

When I got engaged, I reached out to a couple of DJs just to get some quotes but BIG FUN Disc Jockeys immediately won me over by their amazing energy! Paul was the first person I spoke to and he was amazing in understanding exactly what we were looking for and seemed genuinely excited about our day in every conversation! Woody was our DJ assigned to our wedding and he knocked it out of the park! I had a couple of particular ideas about song timing for entrances and special moments and he nailed it all! One of my family members even commented how seamless the transition from the groom’s entrance song was to the bride’s song and thought he remixed it to work so well together! Everyone had an amazing time and I truly believe a big part of it was thanks to Woody for keeping the best vibes with the perfect music! Thank you again Woody!!

DJ Henry was incredible

We LOVED working with DJ Henry for our wedding, and felt so lucky he was available for it. Yes he had the room dancing in their seats during dinner, and yes we got so many compliments from our guests as he played banger after banger all throughout the reception, but those actually weren't even the best parts about working with him:  
  
-First, he's a dream to work with. He set up a detailed checklist for us to work through, responded to every email in less than 24 hours, and worked really hard to make sure he did a great job for us -- from understanding what we wanted in each moment (and more than knowing how to handle a hora) to making sure he knew how to pronounce everyone's names throughout.  
  
-You know you're in good hands for everything beyond the dancing too. Henry mixed sound for our ceremony as well, muting us when appropriate so we could have our own moments up there, and making sure we, our officiant, and our readers all sounded great otherwise.  
  
-He made sure we had the right cuts of every song we wanted to use for special moments -- turning around options for us to choose from basically overnight -- and when we had a song we wanted to process to but it had parts that were too high pitched, he made a new version that toned that down and worked perfectly for us (also overnight!).  
  
Truly could not be happier we had DJ Henry for our wedding, or recommend him more highly!

Highly recommend Henry from Big Fun DJ!

We used Big Fun DJ (Henry Kim) for our wedding and highly recommend their service! From the first time we met with Henry, we know we'd be in good hands - he was extremely organized and went through the day with all his touchpoints in the most clear way possible. And we were right. Communication with Henry is a breeze - he always summarizes our meetings afterwards with detailed notes, clear action items, and deadlines. We had a wide selection of music for dinner and the dance floor, including having one of our friends who's also a DJ do a set in the middle and incorporating English as well as Chinese songs, and Henry handled all that very well. The dance floor was packed and the vibes are great. Thank you Henry!

10/10 Would Hire Again

We couldn’t be more pleased with BigFunDiscJockeys and we’re so grateful for DJ Henry! He made us feel so energized during our 6-week-out planning call–which was top freak out time for me—laying out so clearly what we could expect and how he would run things as MC. He made us so many thoughtful song edits to make sure we had the absolutely best choices to fit our vibe (and accommodate our aversion to dancing to three minute long songs). He kept the dance floor going strong all evening, navigated the transitions between him and our live entertainment seamlessly, and spoke excellent phonetic Spanish. We had no mic or sound issues to speak of! And the fog machine was everything. Thanks, DJ Henry and BigFunDiscJockeys!

Paul did an awesome job and was fun to work with

Our wedding DJ, Paul, absolutely nailed everything! From the moment we met him, he took the time to really understand our music tastes and the vibe we wanted for our big day. The playlists he put together were perfect—he seamlessly blended our favorite songs with crowd-pleasers, keeping the energy high and the dance floor packed all night long. He also went above and beyond with the lighting, transforming the venue into something magical. He was so professional, flexible, and fun to work with, and he really knew how to read the room. We couldn’t be happier with the experience, and our guests are still talking about how great the music and atmosphere were. If you’re looking for a DJ who knows how to create the perfect vibe for your wedding, look no further—he’s absolutely the best!

Henry is awesome!

We booked Henry for our wedding in May 2024 and felt that he did an excellent job of managing the festivities throughout the whole day! When looking at the DJ / entertainment options for our big day, we knew we wanted to make sure that people really compelled to actually get up and dance.  
  
Henry came recommended to us through our planner who mentioned that he had the guests at her last wedding absolutely SWEATING on the dance floor. That sounded just perfect to us!  
  
We had a special request music compilation for a combination father/daughter mother/son dance that Henry was able to turn around to us in absolutely record time! It made our lives so much easier since we no longer had to struggle with making a bootleg quality cut with youtube and a free version of audacity  
  
Henry had great attention to detail when it came to the pronunciations of everyone's names (including those of our parents and whole wedding party). Additionally, he provided us with a convenient way of breaking down our music selections by category (ceremony, cocktail hour, reception, wedding party walk in, etc.). This made the process of curating the tone of the day much easier since we were able to pick music to match each place and time.  
  
Even though our group was mixed generations, Henry did a great job getting everyone up and dancing with a mix of music that catered well to all ages and demographics.  
  
We highly recommend Big Fun for your next big (or small) event!
