I had an absolutely amazing experience working with Jan to design my wedding invitations. She is professoional, knowledgable, respectful, and timely - everything you could ask for from a business. She was committed to my budget and worked incredibly hard to help me stay within it. She had so many options to choose from and her showroom was fantastic. It was so helpful to me to see the invites in person - it provided me with clarity and helped me in my decision. She even created a custom crest for my invite which gave it that extra little something special I was looking for. The invitations shipped quickly and I couldn't be happier with how they came out. This was a standout experience and I will be back the next time I need an invititation!

I hadn’t even thought about wedding invitations until the Tidewater Inn tasting. When our formal invitation arrived, I immediately knew that whoever designed it was going to design ours too. That’s how I found Cink, and I’m so grateful I did. Working with her was an absolute joy. She’s talented, knowledgeable, personable, and kind, which is the perfect combination for a busy bride juggling a hundred details. She made the invitation process seamless and stress-free, guiding me with thoughtful suggestions and a calm confidence that made every decision feel easy. When our invitations arrived, they were even more beautiful than I imagined. Guests kept telling me how stunning they were, and one even said they felt “too pretty to open.” Cink also designed the sweetest custom map of Easton, which I used in our hotel welcome bags. It was such a charming touch that our out-of-town guests adored. If you’re looking for someone who truly understands you as a couple, who has an incredible eye for design, and who makes the process feel joyful instead of stressful, Cink is your woman. Her work perfectly captured the spirit of our wedding and reflected everything we hoped it would be: elegant, personal, and full of heart.

I had the pleasure of working with Kim. I had a bad experience with an online invitation service. The samples were awful and I was desperate to find something in a hurry. I went into the store and explained to Kim what I wanted. Within 20 mins she had customized an invitation for me and it was perfect! I will definitely use Prestons for my Thank you notes!!

I used Christie for my daughters wedding invitations and she was ALWAYS available and so very helpful when we had questions about the correct structure of wording! She also addressed the envelopes which was such an amazing thing to have done and it was spectacular. She has a natural eye and is very generous with her time! I used her 17 and 15 years ago for my children's Bar and Bat Mitzvah invitations. That probably says it all! She is the Best!

Was great to work with always replied back quickly no matter when I emailed. Gave out ideas was willing to try any type of invitation asked all the questions kept me up to date and was very helpful with making sure everything I needed was there all information was provided had everything put together all I had to do was lick the envelope and put it in the mail. She did a great job and I couldn't be happier.

Beth was great to work with! Beth had an awesome selection of invitations and gave us very useful advice on picking our invitations. Once we chose our invitation Beth was patient and made all the changes we asked. We loved working with Beth because she was responsive, easy to work with, honest and professional. Our invitation turned out beautiful and we could not be happier! We definitely recommend Beth! You won't regret it!

We are so glad that we chose Allison Barnhill Designs for our save-the-dates, invitations, and escort cards. Allison made the whole process so easy and was a pleasure to work with! She met with us in her studio and helped us narrow down our fonts, paper, colors, and wording. She has so much experience in the business and the quality of her work is incredible! We had guests raving to us about our save-the-dates and invitations- everyone said it was the best quality/cutest invitations they had ever seen! (and we agree of course!) Allison responded very quickly to e-mails and easily dealt with all my last minute changes (sorry for being difficult!) We had a lot of out-of-country guests invited- she made sure to keep those envelopes separate and not put a stamp on their return envelopes. She even expedited part of our order going to guests out of the country for visa purposes (thank you Allison!) Allison is super organized and got all of our items to us so quickly! I can't express enough how much we loved working with Allison- I would highly recommend her to everyone!

I was at my wits' end trying to find someone to decorate my reception space with jumbo balloons, but Walida made my vision a reality. Our space was AMAZING. She was so accommodating--she made an early morning, hour's drive away to deliver a lot of really big balloons, and it really set the tone for the entire reception. I was floored when I finally saw the end result (they wouldn't let me see it beforehand!). Everyone kept raving about the decor. I was really lucky to have found her, and highly recommend her for your events!

POYC is the best in the business - not only are they a joy to work with but they help guide to find exactly what you are looking for while introducing you to new and fun ideas! We used POYC for everything, engagement party invites, save the dates, bridal shower invites, wedding invites, menus, seating chart, welcome bag tags... and I couldn't have been happier with every single thing. Kathy specifically took the time to explain everything to me - proper etiquette, what to "splurge" on, and things to not even worry about! Every trip to the store was the most fun day and I'm so happy with everything. Thank you Kathy and Hannah!!!
