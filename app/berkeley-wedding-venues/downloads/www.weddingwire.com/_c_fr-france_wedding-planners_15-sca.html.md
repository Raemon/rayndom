We had the best experience with Laure at Alliance Revee- and can't recommend her more! Laure planned our 3 day wedding in Provence (welcome party, wedding, and pool party) and each event was incredible. Laure took care of everything for us from start to finish- she put together a comprehensive plan for our wedding and then advised us each step of planning. At each step Laure took care of everything for us, she is extremely organized and took any feedback we gave her so we just got to do the fun part of wedding planning! We received so many compliments the day of that our guests could tell she was on top of everything, and one of our friends is already using her for their wedding next summer!

From start to finish, Phyllis was absolutely incredible. Her attention to detail, organization, and calm demeanor turned what could have been a stressful day into one of pure joy—for both me and my bride. Phyllis had everything under control, and it showed. We were able to be fully present in every moment because we had complete faith in her. One of the things that stood out most was how well she got to know us as a couple. She took the time to understand our personalities, preferences, and what mattered most to us. That insight allowed her to make on-the-spot decisions throughout the day that perfectly reflected the experience we were hoping for. It never felt like we were just another wedding—she made it feel uniquely ours. There were so many moving parts—timing, vendors, guests, last-minute changes—and somehow, she handled them all seamlessly. Her confidence was contagious, and her steady presence was one of the most comforting parts of the entire experience. We didn’t have to worry about a thing, because she already had it handled—often before we even knew something needed attention. Phyllis gave us the gift of a carefree wedding day, and for that, we are incredibly grateful. If you're looking for someone who truly knows how to make your day magical, personal, and stress-free, look no further. She’s simply the best.

Planning a great destination wedding is ONLY possible with the best planner you can find. Julie (nocesdumonde) is the best. She worked with us for a little less than a year, planning a wedding week that our guests described as a "magical fairytale." Julie created the wedding of our dreams, SEAMLESSLY!! She has an incredible eye for detail, a calm and reassuring presence, and the ability to turn vision into reality. From coordinating vendors to managing logistics and handling unexpected challenges, Julie made the entire process feel effortless. The initial worry of not being able to speak the language of our vendors was never evident throughout because- Julie did it all!!! She is the best. Day of, it felt like we could really relax and enjoy the moments. My husband and I had a very difficult schedule with work and we felt that Julie was a consistent source of calmness and ease through it all!!! She took our Pinterest boards and few meetings and turned into a fairytale wedding week. Her professionalism, creativity, and genuine care for her clients are unmatched. We couldn’t have asked for a better planner, and we are forever grateful for the unforgettable experience she helped us create. Merci beacoup 🤍

Our wedding day in Paris was nothing short of magical, and it wouldn't have been possible without the incredible team at Kiss Me in Paris. From the very first conversation, we knew we were in the best hands. What truly set Kiss Me in Paris apart was their attention to every little detail. They took the time to understand our vision and then brought it to life in ways that completely exceeded our expectations. From the stunning floral arrangements to the seamless coordination on the big day, every element was perfectly curated. One of the most unforgettable moments was stepping into our reception venue for the first time—it was absolutely breathtaking and felt like a fairytale come to life. Chantelle's creativity and dedication meant that we could truly relax and enjoy every second of our special day. The entire team went above and beyond to make sure everything flowed effortlessly, allowing us to be fully present with our loved ones. If you're considering a wedding in Paris, we cannot recommend Kiss Me in Paris enough. They made our wedding not only beautiful but completely stress-free, leaving us with memories that we will treasure forever.

Vanessa and Audrey were so helpful with planning our wedding in Paris! We worked with them for over a year, and they made planning very easy by going one step at a time. But where they really, really shined was making all the details come together on the day of our wedding. The flowers and decor were beautiful, and we had to change some plans due to weather and they were amazing at having a backup plans and helping us enjoy the perfect day (despite some crazy rain showers)!

Samantha was an absolute dream to work with. Over nearly 18 months of planning for our three days of wedding events in Provence, she went above and beyond in every possible way. We always had complete confidence in her ability to deliver — and she exceeded even our highest expectations. Thanks to her meticulous organization and thoughtful approach, we were able to truly be present, focus on each other, and enjoy time with our guests without a single worry about logistics or details. She made the entire experience feel effortless and joyful. Beyond her professionalism, Samantha became such a special part of our lives throughout the planning process — we’ll genuinely miss our regular conversations with her. We couldn’t imagine having done this without her and can’t recommend her highly enough.

If you’re getting married in France, hire Nancy and the Fête in France team — it will be the single best decision and the best money you spend on your wedding. Working with Nancy brought me peace of mind, and helped me enjoy not only the planning process but every moment of my wedding weekend. As a "type A" NYC-based bride planning a destination wedding in a foreign language, I interviewed 10+ planners. Nancy stood out instantly — she is the perfect combination of American professionalism, responsiveness, and organization mixed with French fluency, cultural sensitivities, and relationships. Over 18 months, she guided us through every phase of planning our 70-person wedding weekend at a château near Le Mans. Her planning system —with checklists, timelines, and clear priorities—kept us organized without overwhelming us. She helped us focus on what truly mattered, directing our budget where it would have the most impact and translating our vision into something uniquely ours. Nancy’s calm confidence never wavered, even when a French union strike threatened guest travel in the weeks before the wedding. She handled it seamlessly—communicating updates, coordinating back-up logistics, and keeping everyone at ease. Day-of, she handled the threat of rain with similar grace. Because of her, we were able to be fully present and stress-free throughout the entire weekend. Hiring Nancy and Fête in France was the best choice I made (after my husband!) She turned what could have been a stressful process into an elegant, joyful experience—and gave us a wedding beyond anything we could have imagined.

Claire's team helped plan a magical elopement for 2 in less than 4 weeks. It was the easiest, calmest experience you can imagine. Everything was taken care of and the team of people who managed our day were so professional, kind, enthusiastic, encouraging...I can't say enough good things. Even when it rained up to the very minute of our Eiffel Tower wedding, they were professional, flexible and made the most of the experience. My bouquet was perfect. The hair and makeup were wonderful, easy, beautiful. Our officiant and our ceremony was so, so lovely. And I can't say enough about our photographer and videographer! I can't believe the level of beautiful photos we are receiving! And thank you to our driver too, who managed the chaos of Paris traffic to get the best shots for us all day. 100% recommend this team and wish we could relive it all again :)

We had always had a close connection with France and the French Riviera, both holidayed there a lot, but we did not know where to start to plan our wedding over there. Once we had found the agency Laetitia D, we felt completely taken care of and she guided us into turning our ideas into reality and understood us all the way. The professionalism showed by all the team put all our close ones at ease throughout the process and on the day. Thank you so much again Shanon and Martin
