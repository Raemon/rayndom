We had such a great experience at the Farmer’s Market for our wedding. There was so much included in the package and we really felt it was a great deal. Everyone keeps telling us how much fun they had at our wedding and a lot of that is thanks to the venue. Marlena was also really helpful and great to work with. She always kept in contact with me and was able to provide everything I needed for our perfect day.

Cheri was incredibly easy to work with! She went above and beyond to coordinate visits to the venue with our various vendors, provided linens and chairs and the option for a warehouse full of decorations, and set up the venue according to our outlines perfectly. We were able to have broad access to the venue whenever we needed it the weekend of and used it for our rehearsal & dinner as well. We loved Cheri so much we invited her and her daughter to the wedding and got to celebrate with her! This venue fit our image for our wedding perfectly and we couldn’t be happier we found it!

The Venue at Forest Lake is one of my favorite wedding venues! The scenery and outdoor spaces are unlike anything I've seen in the area, plus this gorgeous waterfront view is only 10 minutes from downtown Oklahoma City. Not only is this the perfect venue for 125 guests, but it also makes for a unique Rehearsal Dinner spot, birthday party, or shower! I highly recommend this venue and it's worth touring!

The Yale Theater hands down was the wedding reception venue of our dreams! Unlike a lot of venues, The Yale is so beautiful all on its own that very minimal decor is needed. It has so much character but also leaves space for flexibility in color schemes, design choices, etc. From the very beginning, we experienced the utmost professionalism, quick communication, and care for our wedding day. Christine was there for whatever we needed and was very patient and helpful as my husband and I are both people who don't make decisions quickly! We got married at our church and had the reception at The Yale, but it would be a beautiful place to do both the ceremony and the reception. One thing we really valued was their clarity on pricing and all that was included with the venue costs. We always felt that they were upfront and fair in any optional, additional costs. The bar costs were also very reasonable compared to what we had seen at other venues. We opted for a mocktail bar, and the bartender made us each a specialty mocktail based on our favorite things. I heard from so many guests about how impressed they were with the venue, the security, and the bar staff. Many people told me it was the most beautiful wedding reception they had ever been to, and that is no doubt thanks to our beautiful venue and all the staff at The Yale Theater! If I could go back, I truly wouldn't change a thing.

We had our ceremony on the front lawn of the historic Overholser Mansion. We had full use of the Carriage house all day as well and the guys were able to get ready there and keep cool before the ceremony started. Liz allowed us to come the evening before to store some stuff in the Carriage house and use the lawn for rehearsal. We had 200 chairs and they easily fit on the lawn using the sidewalk as the aisle. The price for rental of the yard and carriage house is VERY reasonable and it goes to help them with upkeep of the mansion. The mansion is at times open for tours and photos but the actual house can not be used for a wedding. If you are looking for an outdoor venue you should check out the Overholser Mansion. We had our reception downtown in Bricktown and it was nice because it was all so centrally located! Good luck with planning!

I was a bridesmaid and this venue was amazing. There was some chaos and unruly guests and they were super understanding and professional. They were there for our every need and made the entire night as stress free for the bride and groom as possible. I couldn’t recommend them any more!

Our wedding at Camp Loughridge was everything my husband and I hoped for. Our guests had a wonderful time and Kaitlin King worked so hard to make our experience perfect. We could not have chosen a better venue!

Everything was absolutely perfect! The staff was very helpful when needed. They didn't hover over us but were available at a moments notice via text. I would definitely recommend having your event in the Renaissance Square Event Center at The Campbell Hotel!
