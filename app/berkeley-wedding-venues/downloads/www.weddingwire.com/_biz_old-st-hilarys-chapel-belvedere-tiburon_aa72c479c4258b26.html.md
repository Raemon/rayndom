## About

With its gorgeous views overlooking Belvedere, Angel Island and the Golden Gate, this is the perfect place for an intimate wedding ceremony in a historic wedding site. The small white clapboard building with high peaked roof has interior walls of natural redwood, a ceiling of Douglas fir, oak pews and is lit by replicas of the original oil-burning chandeliers. The only original stained-glass window, which is above the door, depicts St. Hilary, patron saint of scholars; the other windows are Gothic arches of amber glass.

Old St Hilary's is an A-Frame white church located at the top of a hill in Tiburon, CA. It's absolutely beautiful and since the church is in the same setting as when it was built in the 1880's, it is the perfect place for those antique weddings! The views of the ocean and harbor below are absolutely gorgeous and the church itself makes for the most romantic pictures. Wear a long veil so it can blow in the wind to add to the romance!

THE MOST beautiful ceremony site I have ever seen. Absolutely breathtaking. Your guests will talk about it for years afterwards. The site coordinator is a little strict and its an extra $500 to have a rehearsal there (which we didn't waste our money on), but overall a good choice.

This church is so unique and has such a sense of history. We instantly knew this was it when the church came into view as we rounded a curve on the small winding road up the hill to the church. It is a magical, white, one room church from the 1800s sitting alone on a rare wildflower preserve- does it get any better?! Actually, yes! We were equally blown away by the unbelievable view- a perfect view of the bay and SF. None of our guests were from the bay area and were stunned by the sheer beauty of Marin & 6 months later still ask us how we ever managed to find such a perfect wedding location.  
  
By the way, since the site is owned by a non-profit preservation society, it's was also nice to know our site fee went to helping with preservation efforts. It's also partly tax-deductible!

Old St. Hilary's Chapel was our dream wedding location, and we're so glad we picked it! It's a "deconsecrated" Victorian Catholic chapel from 1888, which meant we could have a spiritual wedding in a chapel without having to commit to a particular religion or anyone else's idea of pre-marital counseling. The chapel is gorgeous--white and wooden, surrounded by wildflowers, and with views of the San Francisco Bay. The inside is warm, natural redwood, and the pews have handmade needlepoint cushions of the local wildflowers. There are hiking trails through the wildflower preserve and around it.  
  
A caution: Because the chapel is managed by a historical society and because it's on a nature preserve, the rules are really strict. It's atop a hill and has only five parking spaces. The contract binds you to use only the shuttle companies on the Landmarks Society preferred vendors list, and when we called around, the only shuttle company that would be willing to take on the project was going to charge $1200 minimum for two hours of work. Instead, many of our guests walked, but we weren't even allowed to provide tea or snacks when they reached the top, because of the wildflowers. We thought the Landmarks Society hadn't returned our $500 security deposit, but it turns out they mailed it to my parents-in-law instead. Excluding the security deposit, we spent $1,550 on the 3-hour rental with no rehearsal.   
  
On the positive side, the Landmarks Society had no objection to us bringing a horse and carriage! We highly recommend this venue, but be aware of the many rules you'll have to follow.
