We reserved Hastings House for our wedding in early November 2024. It was a fantastic event thanks to Linda and her leadership, her marvelous garden, and the ambiance created by her husband Richard and his guitar. We got lucky with a gorgeous sunny day that brought out the best lighting for the garden ceremony and photos. Our family and friends were impressed with the whole experience. Linda helped us right from the start with a recommendation list that included Dave Medal Photography, La Costanera for the reception and Alena Jean for our florals. The few months of preparation and the day of events could not have gone any better and we cannot recommend Linda and her garden enough.

We cannot imagine a more perfect wedding venue! We got to work with both Nancy and Jenn and they were so easy to work with and made sure our wedding was the perfect day. They always made themselves available for calls and answered our questions in a timely manner. We did multiple meals at the venue (welcome dinner, reception, farewell brunch and all the food was SO GOOD. Over a week later and we still have guests telling us how great their experience was and how they did not leave hungry. Not only was the venue gorgeous, but the list of preferred vendors Nancy and Jenn have put together is incredibly helpful and provides a wide variety of options. The hotel staff also made the experience extra amazing - they supported all our guests needs and our needs throughout the weekend and they made the weekend run super smoothly. Could not recommend this place stronger if you are looking for a Bay Area wedding!

We wanted to have a fairly non-traditional ceremony and reception, Long Branch was amazing to work with! We especially appreciated all the activities and fun things for our guests to do :) Instead of a cake we ordered some local pastries to go with Long Branch's amazing home made ice cream! They did a good job with everything and were so flexible, I can't think of a single thing we asked about that they said no - instead they were always trying to find fun, creative ways to say yes. They have a perfect driveway to park two food trucks, and we really wanted to have amazing food at our wedding - they helped us pull it off!

We had contemplated on having our wedding at San Benito House before the unfortunate fire happened at their place. Kai was such an amazing partner, he went out of his way to continue to work with us and cater our wedding and rehearsal dinner at another venue. They really pulled out all of the stops for us! The food was excellent and the bar service was great. They brought so many different drink options and they worked with us to put the perfect menu together. I would highly recommend working with Kai at San Benito House and I wish them all the best and have my fingers crossed for a quick reopening!

This place became a benchmark to what to what we like if we are going to splurge on a nice place to stay. It was fantastic place to stay and overpriced at all. Very clean room,excellent location close to downtown,to the beach,to fantastic restaurants also close to Mavericks surfing area. Beautiful room, lovely staff, super service, I couldn’t recommend this place, Mill Rose Inn, enough, Hope to be back here sometime soon. It was quite and very romantic place.

What an exceptional experience! Everything from the cozy and modern setting with comfy seats and fire pits to the 5* service by the staff , to the delicious food crated by Chef Jose Luis Ugalde (formally with Cafe Gibraltar) and the incredible hand crafted unique (and delicious) cocktails, everything was beyond perfect!!! Our guests were beyond pleased and we would not have changed a thing. This is our new favorite hang out and event space on the coast! Thank you Jetty Wave team for making our experience an exceptional one! We love the Jetty Wave!
