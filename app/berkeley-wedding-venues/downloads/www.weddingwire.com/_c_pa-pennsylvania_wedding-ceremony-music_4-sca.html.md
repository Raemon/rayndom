Andre the Hitman delivered exactly what we were hoping for at our wedding. His live performance during the cocktail hour was engaging and well-paced, creating a welcoming atmosphere without overpowering conversation. He was professional, prepared, and clearly experienced, which made everything feel easy and natural for both us and our guests. At the reception, Andre transitioned smoothly into his DJ set and kept the night moving with great music choices and timing. The flow of the evening felt intentional and well managed, and the dance floor stayed active throughout. We were so impressed with his versatility that we plan to hire him again for future private parties and events.

Tim was an absolute delight. He understood exactly what we wanted from a guitarist during our ceremony and cocktail hour. Also, I must say as a true professional, when I requested that Tim not sing during our ceremony processional, he lightly pushed back and expressed that the singing isn't a distraction, and that the songs don't usually sound as elegant and beautiful without it. I really appreciated his advice and that he so kindly and respectively expressed why he felt differently. I went with my gut and trusted Tim. He learned Lover by Taylor Swift for me to walk down the aisle to, and he absolutely nailed it. And he was right. Hearing the lyrics as I walked down the aisle was truly an experience I'll never forget. It made that moment so perfect and I even sang along. Hire Tim for your wedding, you won't regret it! He is so talented and kind and is such a pro. Thanks again Tim!

Talented musicians-easy to work with and so helpful. They even learned a special song just a few weeks before the wedding! They helped with song selection thanks to their expansive collection! Very affordable and responsive. I’d hire them again for future events in a heartbeat 💓&nbsp;

You cannot go wrong with Nick. He is amazing, talented, knowledgeable, prepared for anything, so quick to respond, and up to play any music! We hired Nick and Brian to play guitar and violin for our ceremony and cocktail hour music. I can’t tell you how many of our guests were raving about them! These two were so much fun and provided a beautiful soundtrack to our wedding. I’m still getting texts and calls from our guests saying how wonderful they were and so unique. I was glad I could attend cocktail hour to hear them play! Do yourself a favor and book Nick now for the most amazing and memorable wedding music experience!!!!

We had the pleasure of having the string quartet for our ceremony and our cocktail hour! I wanted a timeless feel to the music throughout these moments, and I wanted music that felt like it was living and breathing with us instead of just choppy like you get with a normal playlist sometimes. Andrea Levine Artists were amazing to work with and made our wedding beautiful. We spent a little extra money to have them learn a new song to add to the ceremony, and it was one of my groom's (and my mom's!!!) favorite parts of the day! Absolutely no hiccups. I would recommend any day!

Elegance Quartet was the icing on the cake for our wedding. Ray and his team were amazing from the beginning of the planning process to the end. Their music made our wedding feel magical. My husband, Spartak, was born in Albania and came to the US when he was 5. I wanted to make sure that Albanian traditions were a part of our wedding. A big part of an Albanian wedding is having incredible music and to have a dance called a Valle. When I first talked to Ray after hearing his music online, I thought he and his team were so talented. He was also from Albania. Ray went out of his way to really make our wedding special by showcasing Albanian songs from Tirana where Spartak was born and helping to create a really beautiful Valle mix. He even brought Spartak's dad a special gift from Albania which his dad loved. My husband and I also work in the entertainment industry in New York and a lot of our guests are also in the entertainment business. A few of them came up to me and said they were jamming outside during the prelude for the wedding and during cocktail hour. Ray also set up a screen and played a video slide show that I had and made sure it looked and sounded great for all guests to hear. I would recommend anyone who wants live music to go with Ray and his team. The DJ Fusion that they incorporate was so much fun and made the wedding so memorable. Ray really took the time to make sure every detail for the day was perfect. Thanks again Ray!

Our experience with Harp and Soul was wonderful! Nichole was so helpful and kind. At first I wasn't sure a solo harp would be the beast choice for our service, but I was so wrong. It was so lovely and ethereal, now I can't believe I didn't realize how perfect it would be.

I planned my wedding at Phipps long distance. I knew I wanted a string trio, as I had always imagined walking in to Cannon in D. I communicated with Susanna in the months leading up to the wedding, and she was always helpful. I took advantage of the offer a special piece could be arranged. I requested "Never Tear Us Apart" by INXS. It was absolutely perfect! We actually took a moment after our ceremony, to enjoy the arrangement and had out first dance; pic included. It was everything we had hoped for
