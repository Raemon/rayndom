Friendly Service and Beautiful Work 

We had both our save the date and invitations designed by Paper on Pine. We loved working with Cindy and the design team. They were a huge hit and our guests mentioned them religiously. Without Cindy and her team addressing the envelopes we never would have gotten around to inviting anyone to the wedding. They even helped us word the invitations in a way to avoid as much awkwardness as possible as one family did not attend.

Best Wedding Stationary in Philly!

I love Paper on Pine !

This was absolutely one of the most enjoyable parts of the whole wedding experience. We had had a friend who is a professional photographer take our photo but beyond that I was clueless to what we might want as far as an invitation. The ladies at Paper on Pine walked me through it, made it fun and the results left me speechless. They were just do gorgeous and do exactly beyond my expectations. Every single person who got an invite said they loved them and will hold them as keepsakes. I highly recommend this little gem of a shop. In addition to the invites I got thank you cards, pens, a guest book, gift bags and tissue paper. Plus, it’s located in a really fun neighborhood in Philly. (My girlfriends and I later did a bar-crawl through the gayborhood for my bachelorette party). Can’t ravd enough about this place ! Thank you Mackenzie and Cindy !

Wonderful Experience Creating Custom Wedding Stationary

I decided to go with Paper on Pine to create my custom wedding invitations, programs and accompanying signs and stationary. I worked with Mackenzie and Cindy to create the most beautiful invitations that were exactly what I had imagined. They were extremely patient and understanding in going through the many drafts to get to the final product, and always responsive and prompt. The end result was unique and amazing and we got so many compliments. I would highly recommend Paper on Pine for all of your wedding stationary needs!

We used paper on pine for our wedding invitations and escort cards. We worked with Melissa who helped us pick out invitations within our budget that first our style and helped us with the correct wording and etiquette. The invitations are on the expensive side but not any more than anywhere else you would get wedding invitations in the area. Melissa was very responsive to my many questions via email. She emailed me samples of everything and had everything done in a timely manner. She was even nice enough to reprint two of my escort cards after I realized I had made some spelling errors after I got them home. My husband and I would recommend paper on pine for wedding invitations and other stationary.

We worked with Emily at Paper on Pine to create our wedding invitations and RVSP cards. After researching popular invitation companies both online and in-store, we came up with a reasonable budget for about 170 invitations. We were worried that a custom design and order would put us over budget, but we made the appointment to talk budget and design. Most of our guests are out of town, so we really wanted to stick with a Philadelphia theme. Our invitations have the LOVE park sign on them and the RSVPs have an outline of the skyline- exactly what I had imagined in my head for months, but hadn't found anywhere else. The best part was that not only was Emily able to create the design I loved, but everything was actually under our original budget! I am SO happy we decided to use Paper on Pine for our invitations.
