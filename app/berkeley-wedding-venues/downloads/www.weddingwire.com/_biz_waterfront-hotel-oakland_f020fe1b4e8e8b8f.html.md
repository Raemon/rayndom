We had our reception at the Waterfront. Honestly, the venue itself was not amazing at first look. It looks very hotel conference room and not grand ballroom. I was most nervous about the low ceilings and it feel claustrophobic. All my doubts were put at ease by Michelle, the catering coordinator, and the food. Michelle treated us so well when we met with her. We met with a number of vendors who didn't seem to care if we went with them one way or the other. Michelle was dedicated, offered outstanding customer service, and was so personable. We tried some of the food and it was delicious.  
  
Michelle had the pleasure of answering all of my questions for almost a year. She handled my annoying questions with poise. She answered my questions thoroughly and promptly. She also answered the questions in a way where I knew she had our interest in mind and wasn't trying to get more revenue for her hotel necessarily.   
  
Our initial downside for the venue, the low ceilings, was really minimized by the gorgeous patio and the lighting company we hired. The biggest downside we had was scheduling. We had a Catholic ceremony, which means it was early. There was quite a gap and we couldn't get into the Waterfront any earlier without paying more. Michelle was gracious enough that if someone didn't rent the morning, we could setup early.   
  
The only other downside was that one of the bars and photo booth setup was in a sort of hallway that connected the hotel with the restaurant. We had reports of a few people grabbing some free drinks and photo booth shots. Not the end of the world and not too much the venue can do; it's just a design flaw.  
  
Besides Michelle, the best part of the Waterfront is the food. I was nervous that the chef could do three or four amazing meals but what about 160 all at once. The answer is yes. If food is important to you, this is the selection for you. The chef and Michelle were also great at accommodating allergies. Everyone raved about the food!!
