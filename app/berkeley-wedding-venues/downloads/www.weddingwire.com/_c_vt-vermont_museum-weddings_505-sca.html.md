The museum was a phenomenal place to have our wedding ceremony and reception. The backdrop of well-curated art was perfect and fun for our large (170-person) event; the white marble steps leading up to what had been ticket booths when the building was a train station were a superlative place to hold our ceremony and easily be seen and heard by all guests. Because there are several galleries within the museum, it was easy for us to set up a variety of areas for our guests to enjoy (i.e. photo booth, guest book & gift table, letter-writing activity area, cake table, etc). And, several people (florists, DJs, other folks who attend a lot of events) commented that they had never seen a staff as upbeat, helpful, and attentive as the museum's event staff, lead by the Event Manager Kelly Therieau. We recommend it highly for a museum visit and as an event site!

Nothing but raves for this incredible site. The staff were amazing. This is a full time art gallery which has an events staff for off-hour events. They were available, flexible and incredibly helpful. I stopped in several times and they had someone there to meet me and answer questions and trouble shoot. The space looked amazing and the different art installations offered a beautiful and unique space for our guests. They had wonderful suggestions for other vendors who worked well in their space and worked collaboratively with all of the other vendors to solve any little glitch that came up. The night of the wedding was effortless. I can't recommend them enough. Lisa, Mallory and Kim were incredible to work with and it was great to know our money was going to support Burlington City Arts, a creative local non-profit.

We somewhat accidentally stumbled upon SVAC as a venue, but we are thankful we did as we are so pleased with how everything turned out. We had our October reception at SVAC (ceremony in a church), but took advantage of the connected properties of the Barrows House and Dorset Inn. Working with Colleen Palmer and all of the Church St Hospitality Group was a joy. Colleen worked with us closely to craft exactly the wedding we wanted- the food, the bar, the decor. It was also very helpful that Colleen knew so many of our other vendors- everything went off without a hitch. The chef, JJ, was very receptive to any requests we had, such as tweaking a sauce, or a special order appetizer. He even personally delivered the meals to the bride and groom during the reception, which was a nice touch. Our guests have not stopped raving about how SVAC was such a great venue. Everyone enjoyed strolling the galleries during the cocktail hour, and taking photos outside in the beautiful setting which nicely displays the gorgeous fall foliage. We strongly recommend that you also make use of the Barrows House. A good portion of our guests stayed there and we had a welcome dinner there on Friday night. Colleen also organized the welcome dinner and thus was really able to capture our vision for how we wanted our guests to enjoy their time in Vermont- harvest buffet of local food, fire pits and s'mores for the kids. All around, we highly recommend SVAC for a wedding venue.

The grounds at the Old Stone House are unique and beautiful but what really set this venue apart was the outstanding staff and their willingness to support us in the planning process and set up. We had access to the site starting on Thursday for our Saturday wedding and didn't have to clean up until Sunday; making our wedding set up as stress-free as possible. We were able to have a campfire on site and lawn games too. There is something for everyone at this venue!

I had always wanted to have my wedding reception at the museum. It fit my needs on every level in terms of location, space, value, and uniqueness. Every one of my guests had an amazing time and I can't ask for more than that!
