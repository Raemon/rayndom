Yellowrose Inn exceeded every expectation. Bess hosted a corporate event for me, and the entire experience was seamless from start to finish. The space was absolutely stunning—beautifully designed, impeccably maintained, and perfectly suited for a professional event. Bess is a true professional who anticipates every detail and executes with care, creativity, and precision. Her attention to detail, organization, and hospitality made the event effortless and memorable. I couldn’t have asked for a better venue or host and would highly recommend Yellowrose Inn for any corporate or special event.

If you are considering Holly Farm as the venue for your wedding, and you just want the tl;dr, then here are my three most important suggestions for you: 1) You should absolutely go with Holly Farm. 2) You should accept every piece of advice Erin, Ryan, and the rest of the incredible team have for you along the way. 3) You should start getting excited right now about La Creme because their food is out of this world. Picking Holly Farm as our venue was the first choice we made in our wedding planning process, and trust me when I say that it was by far the best one. The pictures speak for themselves, and yes, it's as amazing as it looks (though if you haven't visited, you should take the excuse - it's truly stunning in person), but the real game changer is the team. The Holly Farm fam has been at this for decades, and it SHOWS. They cater to your needs and your vision, whether you want to be super hands on and into the nitty gritty on everything, or whether you want somebody to completely take the reins for you. We were so so appreciative for Erin's help during the planning process; any time we were stuck on something, she had a recommendation ready that was never just "off the shelf". We didn't want to be totally consumed by wedding planning all the time, and even though Erin had a big list of vendors ready to go, we were more than happy to listen every time she said "here's the 2 who I think you guys would love". It's really really telling to me that every single vendor we spoke to - without exception, including the ones we didn't end up choosing - all said some version of the same thing: "oh man I LOVE doing weddings at Holly Farm". Here's what I'll say about the weekend itself - it truly feels like you are staying at a luxury resort where you and your friends are the only guests. The entire staff is so attentive, so friendly, and they take care of all the details and logistics so that your only job really is to just enjoy the weekend and stay relaxed. We cooked a huge friends and family dinner in the Adobe and they cleaned the entire kitchen for us! Anytime we were hanging out in the evenings they rolled the portable heaters up without us asking! They moved our rental equipment around to make cool outdoor spaces for us so that we could get more use out of it than just the wedding itself! And nothing felt so satisfying as passing by Ryan on a path and hearing "hey I just lit your fireplace for you!". Of everything we loved about our wedding, the thing we loved most was getting to have this full weekend experience with our closest friends and family in one place, made truly special by the care the entire Holly Farm team put into making us feel at ease and at home. And one final thing - lest I leave you with the impression that this is only about good vibes - the operations for the wedding itself were incredible. Every vendor knows the team and knows the venue, everything works like clockwork without you having to supervise anything, and Erin, Ryan, and their staff have things so tightly coordinated that we didn't have to stress about logistics at all once the weekend got started. I can't emphasize enough how big a difference that made to us compared to some horror stories we'd heard from other weddings. Here are some final quick hits on other things you might be wondering about - but seriously, pick Holly Farm: \- I didn't write an entire review for Tamie and La Creme, because it would be just as long, but they do amazing work. This is straight up excellent food, not excellent "wedding" food. \- The rooms and buildings are very cool and very comfortable. \- Yes, the Paraiso suite is "open air". Yes, it really does stay warm. Having a roaring fire in there, plus a heated blanket on the bed....A+. \- The optional River House for extra space is definitely walkable (~3 mins), but it's nice to have flashlights at night. \- Having the flexibility to use the space however you want for the entire weekend is a highly highly underrated perk. We had people hanging out on Thursday and Friday and it was a ton of fun. Highly recommend making plans that utilize the space every day. \- We were nervous about the higher cost at first, but asking friends and family who stayed on site to pay for rooms turned out to not be a very big deal, and what we charged them was still way less than area hotels. \- The music has to switch from DJ's speakers to house speakers at 9:30pm, but the house speakers can stay on all night if you want. We had just as much fun after the switchover. \- No curfew is also a huge perk not to overlook. Erin and Ryan if you're reading this THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN YOU GUYS ARE ROCK STARS!!

My fiance and I met with The Clubhouse at Paradise Valley on my mother's recommendation. The location was great and the venue is beautiful. But the maximum capacity just wasn't right for our wedding. The person we were touring with highly recommended their sister venue at Rancho Solano. She made a few calls, and we were on our way to tour Rancho Solano immediately that day.

From the moment we chose Calamigos Ranch for our wedding venue, we knew we had made a perfect decision, but the actual experience surpassed all our expectations. Hosting our wedding on February 22, 2024, at the exquisite Redwood Room was a dream come true. The seamless blend of indoor and outdoor spaces provided by this venue created an enchanting atmosphere that left us and our guests in awe. The natural beauty and serene ambiance of the Redwood Room added a magical touch to our special day, making it an unforgettable experience for everyone involved. The service we received at Calamigos Ranch was nothing short of high class. Every detail was attended to with the utmost care and professionalism, ensuring our day was as seamless and beautiful as we had imagined. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our needs and preferences, making us feel truly special and well taken care of. Our wedding has been the talk of our friends and family, with many commenting on the class and beauty of the event. The stunning setting, combined with the exceptional service, made our wedding not just a celebration, but a memorable experience that will be cherished by us and our guests for years to come. We cannot express enough gratitude to Helen, the Event Sales Specialist at Calamigos Ranch, for her dedication and hard work. Her expertise and friendly approach made the planning process smooth and enjoyable. Helen's commitment to making our wedding perfect was evident in every interaction, and we are truly grateful for her support. A special shout out to Garrett and Ramiro for their generous support throughout our wedding day. Their attentiveness and professionalism contributed significantly to the success of our event, and we are so appreciative of their efforts. Choosing Calamigos Ranch for our wedding was the best decision we could have made. The breathtaking venue, impeccable service, and the supportive team made our wedding day not just an event, but a beautiful beginning to our life together. We wholeheartedly recommend Calamigos Ranch to any couple looking for a classy, beautiful, and unforgettable wedding experience. Thank you to the entire team for making our dream wedding a reality.

The Dana Powers House and Barn was an absolute dream for our wedding. From the moment we laid eyes on it, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day. The rustic elegance of the barn combined with its inherent charm was exactly what we had envisioned. Melanie, who managed the venue, was an absolute gem. Her responsiveness and willingness to answer all our queries made the planning process smoother. She truly helped bring our vision to life. The ceremony area, set on a patch of lush green grass with a wooden stage, was like something out of a fairytale. The backdrop of vibrant green trees added an ethereal touch that made our vows even more magical. The venue's details, like the beautiful rose bushes, added a picturesque quality to our photos that we'll cherish forever. And the presence of a fire pit allowed our guests to enjoy the sweet delight of s'mores—a thoughtful touch that added to the cozy, intimate atmosphere. Overall, the Dana Powers House and Barn encapsulated everything we desired in a venue. The blend of elegance, rustic charm, and natural beauty provided the perfect backdrop for our special day. Countless compliments poured in about how stunning the venue was, reaffirming that we had made the best choice for our wedding. It truly was a place where dreams came true.

Couldn’t recommend this venue more. Good price, beautiful venue and area, and amazing people to work with! Pros: \- base price is reasonable, and there’s plenty you can add on if you want to really splurge (but you don’t have to, their base offerings are great!) \- venue itself is absolutely gorgeous. Our ceremony on the pepper tree patio was picturesque and intimate. Then the cocktail hour + dancing area was beautiful under the twinkling lights at night \- we had our guests (180 of them) stay in Carlsbad Village (SpringHill suites, specifically) and they were blown away by the town. There’s so much to do there, and so much walkability. We had a ton of out of town guests, and most didn’t even rent a car since everything was so close. \- staff: the Personal Touch Dining folks were incredible. They responded to all of our questions within minutes, and we felt like we were in good hands the entire time. Josie in particular was fantastic to work with! Cons: \- only con I can think of is that at Leo Carrillo, the DJ is limited to playing music beyond a certain volume. It was quieter than I would have liked. We played a bunch of sing along songs so that we could basically BECOME the music… and that helped. But I wish they would have let us bump the dance floor music more. Still though, I wouldn’t worry too much. I have been to a lot of weddings and our dance floor vibes were pretty top notch regardless!

We were very happy with our experience with the Wedgewood team. Even though you interact with different people every time, they are all experts at weddings and can guide you through the process. They were very responsive and quickly answered all our questions and weird requests. They give you a planning binder and schedule regular checkpoints to ensure you are making progress. Overall, they made the process enjoyable and less stressful.

I don't even know where to begin. Monteleone Meadows is by far the best venue out there, hands down. From the wonderful family that runs the venue, to the smoked tri tip and delicious food to the absolutly beautiful venue... i couldnt have asked for a better experience! I toured several other locations in so cal, and nothing came close to the personal experience and dedication from the team. They made the whole experience perfect and memorable!

McGraths was a dream come true. This is one of the more affordable venues in the area with the most spectacular garden. The team went out of their way to accommodate all of our COVID changes and helped to make our day a dream come true. We were excited to have a whimsical Garden reception here, but due to covid had to move our ceremony here instead. It ended up just perfect! Our first look in the garden made for amazing photos. The lights shining through the trees and the beautiful nature sounds were spectacular. The sparkler walk was so magical on their front drive. We couldn't have asked for a better venue! Thank you McGrath and team! 💜

From the Mother of the Bride: The Red Horse Barn venue and event planning company AAEI were top-notch. Every aspect of the event flowed smoothly and it was beautiful. The venue itself is magical. The site tucked away in the Equestrian area. Both Michael & Robyn of AAEI gave many great suggestions for the right vendors for my daughter's wedding. The packages are mostly all inclusive. Florals, caterer, dj, videographer, bakery, etc. - we were thrilled with the outcome. Everyone that attended said it far exceeded their expectations and I have to agree (we had 133 at the wedding and had plenty of room). Even the bride and groom's preparation suites on site were very spacious and private. My daughter absolutely loved the magical and upbeat vibe of the reception. I would highly recommend the Red Horse Barn and AAEI.
