Challenges? Hire a wedding therapist!

Early on in the wedding process, my daughter and I found ourselves struggling with very different expectations for the wedding, different communication styles, different ways of planning and getting things done. Throw in a generation gap—and the groom’s family, who is from a different culture, and brought their own desires and expectations, and we had quite a challenge!   
  
Landis from Aisle Talk did a beautiful job helping us to understand each other and guiding us through most of the wedding planning. She was supportive and empathetic to us both, while challenging us to widen our perspectives and embrace a more flexible and positive vision of the wedding. Better than a wedding planner, she focused on the bigger picture of our long-term relationship (past and present and future), and even gave us a little homework so that we kept moving forward, both with plans and relationship building.   
  
Weddings are so expensive, even simple ones. Using some money to work with Landis will have benefits long after the wedding itself!

AisleTalk - 8.23.25 Wedding Officiant!

We feel so lucky to have had Landis officiate our wedding. From the very beginning, she approached the process with so much enthusiasm, care, and professionalism — you would've never known this was her first time officiating!   
  
Landis was incredibly detailed, organized, and thoughtful every step of the way. She went above and beyond in preparing for the ceremony - doing extensive research, asking meaningful questions, and ensuring that every element we wanted was represented in a way that felt personal and authentic to us. She was transparent, flexible, and so communicative, always making sure we felt informed and comfortable. She even also went out of her way to travel a long distance for our wedding, which meant so much to us.  
  
Landis brings a rare blend of empathy, presence, and understanding to everything she does, qualities that made our ceremony feel grounded, heartfelt, and beautifully intentional. She created a space that felt genuine and meaningful, and she captured the essence of our relationship perfectly. Landis has an incredible gift for making others feel seen, understood, and supported, and we can’t imagine a more perfect person to have led is into our marriage. We’re so grateful to Landis for making our ceremony so special and so memorable!

Farzana, our pre-marital counseling guru

My wife and I reached out to AisleTalk for pre-marital counseling about a year ago. I’d been married before, and I was adamant that we start early and build the tools to work through any challenges that might come our way. Our therapist, Farzana, was phenomenal. After our first session—where we outlined our needs and goals—she provided us with an assessment that became the foundation for every session thereafter.  
  
Because of that work, we now have both the tools and the shared vision to navigate anything that comes our way. That doesn’t mean we’ll never go to therapy again—it means we have confidence in ourselves and in the partnership we’ve built.  
  
I’m grateful every day for the time Farzana spent with us. I highly recommend her and AisleTalk to any couple who wants to strengthen their relationship, whether they’re just getting started or years in.
