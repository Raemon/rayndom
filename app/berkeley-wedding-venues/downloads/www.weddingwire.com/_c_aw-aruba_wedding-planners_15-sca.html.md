Our wedding with Dream Weddings Aruba was truly everything we dreamed of and more. From start to finish, Robert Arenz and his incredible team made the entire experience effortless, personal, and unforgettable. Planning a destination wedding can feel overwhelming, but Robert’s calm expertise and attention to every detail gave us complete confidence. The setting was breathtaking — soft sand, turquoise water, and a beautifully designed ceremony space that reflected our style perfectly. The entire day flowed seamlessly, and the team made sure every moment felt natural and full of joy. The hair and makeup artists were wonderful — warm, professional, and talented. They made getting ready such a fun and relaxing part of the day, and everyone looked amazing from the first photo to the last dance, even in the island breeze. Our officiant, John made the ceremony truly special. His kind and genuine words captured our story perfectly, making the moment feel heartfelt and deeply personal. It was as if a lifelong friend was guiding us into marriage. And the photos — absolutely stunning. Every smile, sunset, and candid moment was captured beautifully, allowing us to relive the magic of that day again and again. We are endlessly grateful to Dream Weddings Aruba, Robert, John, and the entire team for giving us the most romantic and meaningful celebration imaginable. It was pure perfection in every way — a day we’ll cherish forever. Thank you! Mary Grace and Anthony Pittsburgh, PA USA

From the very beginning, we felt supported, understood, and truly cared for. The team was incredibly responsive even late at night when my anxiety would hit, Leandro was right there, answering emails and offering reassurance. They listened to us so carefully and brought our vision to life in a way that was even more beautiful than we could have imagined. Every detail on the wedding day was executed flawlessly, thoughtful and very elegant. We hosted our welcome party at Moomba beach, and the D-Alma team showed up just to make sure everything was running smoothly. The day before the wedding, they organized a full rehearsal and a meeting with all the vendors making sure everyone was aligned and that we could feel totally at ease. Their calm energy, creativity, and professionalism are truly remarkable. And as if that wasn’t enough, the morning after the wedding, they came by our hotel to personally say goodbye and brought us a small, thoughtful gift. D-Alma is more than a planning and coordination team. They are artists, organizers, and most importantly, kind humans who care deeply about making your day unforgettable. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!

My kids and I wanted to surprise my wife with vow renewal on our 25th anniversary while on the island of Aruba. I did some looking here and elsewhere and found glowing reviews on Lissy and her team so, sight unseen, I hired them to plan it. It was a great decision. Lissy let me have exactly what I wanted and none of what I didn't. Our kids officiated, and the setup on the beach between the Fofoti trees at sunset was perfect. Suzanne took great pictures, and Lissy took care of the setup, flowers, sand ceremony, and managing our area of the beach to keep people out of our private ceremony and pictures. The only stress I had that day was hoping my wife would say "Yes!" (and she did!) If you are planning a destination wedding or vow renewal in Aruba, be sure to reach out to Lissy and her company. You'll be glad you did!

We worked with Deyanira when we decided to elope in Aruba in December 2025. We wanted a legal civil ceremony that required some paperwork in advance for the government of Aruba. We felt we may need help through the process. She was knowledgeable, and took away the stress of booking City Hall ourselves, arranging for our marriage certificate, witnesses etc. We were very pleased with how the day went. The value was pretty good based on what the individual costs would have been if we booked everything ourselves. It took a lot of stress away having someone "on the ground" for you when you live out of the country. We had a great experience!
