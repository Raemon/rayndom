We used All Seasons Event Rental for a portable bar and we dealt primarily with Rachel. She was responsive, helpful, and the quality of the product was excellent. We did not meet the minimum amount for delivery so we had to go to KCK to pick up the bar while our event was down in Southwest Johnson County but that was fine as we had family members willing to help out and pick up/drop off the bar during airport runs. We would definitely use All Seasons again if we had an event!

As a business owner planning events, I work only with A-1 for any rental needs I have. I find their staff to be courteous, knowledgeable, patient as I decide on what's needed and helpful. Anything I rent is impeccably clean, and ready to go -- and as often I use their pick up and delivery service -- reliable and timely are always what comes to mind. You get the consistent value you pay for and that is priceless when you consider the other things on your "to do" list as you plan out events! Highly, highly recommend!

Tina turned our already beautiful venue into the most magical ceremony and reception space we could have hoped for. The bouquets were absolutely gorgeous, the tables were beautiful and full of flowers and candles, and there was no detail overlooked. And to top it off, Tina is a joy to work with. She makes all of the planning an absolute breeze and everyone will love your flowers and decorations!

I have read this last review. The rental site was in the middle of a muddy field. We put up the tent and sides. Helped set up all table/chairs at no cost to her. Asked if everything was OK prior to leaving and she responded everything looked great. No mention of any of this. She attempted to stop payment after we provided a service and lost. I always find it amusing that everyone states everything is great and then want money back after the product and service was performed. I am sorry she was not happy after the fact. We did everything in our power to make her special day great. Customer service is our first and foremost priority.

Pam and her company did an excellent job for my 35th class reunion. The chair covers and sashes made the room very elegant. I would recommend this company to everyone. True professionals.

We used them for the top service and a custom ceremony. We used the online portal, paid online, signed the contract online, and were by far the easiest vendor we hired. The invoice reminder kept me honest and the questionnaire was detailed. This company was already shining then we spent two and a half hours on the phone with Josh doing our interview. He wrote the most beautiful script and helped us in so many ways outside of officiating that we ended up hiring weddingly as a day of coordinator too. If you call them you can tell immediately they are really experienced and do this full time. I never thought that someone could have a wedding minister company but they are doing it and it is amazing. I don't remember the name of my officiant but he was excellent. He did everything perfectly including commanding the room for my rehearsal. I remember he said the funniest thing to the guys and it has turned out to be one of those great lasting memories for us ... "If you boys like drinking and eating - ship up, get in line, act like a good third grader, and lets get going! There is food and beer waiting on you." Honestly from the outside it seems condescending but our group is just a bit more rowdy and Josh placed us with the absolute perfect minister who could handle our group of rowdy boys. I wish I could give 10 starsFantast.
