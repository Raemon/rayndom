We couldn’t have asked for a better officiant. She was easy to work with from the very start—warm, professional, and open to our ideas. She embraced our unique setting and delivered a ceremony that felt deeply meaningful and perfectly suited to us. Her delivery had real presence and gravitas, making the moment feel both intimate and profound. We highly recommend her to anyone looking for an officiant who brings heart, grace, and depth to the occasion.

We had a wonderful experience with Jeff from Validated Vows! We found him to be an excellent communicator, he was responsive to our needs, and easy to get a hold of. He helped to keep us organized on a cross-country wedding, as we live near Portland, OR, but the wedding was on Long Island. We had a great online meeting to introduce ourselves, he asked the right questions on what we were looking for and getting to know us. He used that information to craft a ceremony script that fit our relationship and made it feel like he knew us for months! We had several editing sessions back and forth until we were satisfied with the ceremony. We then had an in-person meeting to verify the script was set. The day of the ceremony, things went as we had planned, he kept to the script as written, and his easy-going style helped to keep things relaxed. Just as importantly, after the ceremony, he turned in the signed marriage license to the City Clerk's office within two days, and communicated that by email. Overall, we found Validated Vows to be an excellent service, and we highly recommend him!

Sarah was amazing, truly making our wedding ceremony beautiful. She took the time to get to know us and this made the words she prepared for our ceremony heartfelt. We had so many guest tell us that they were crying through out the ceremony. She kept us on track during the wedding and used well timed levity to cover over my own confusion during the ceremony. We are so grateful for Sarah's help through out the whole process, including the help she provided in writing our vows. She was also extremely organized which made planning so easy. Sarah was a professional from start to finish and so friendly putting us at ease during our most nervous moments.

Neal from the time we met him at the wedding expo in Albany, to our most recent encounter at the altar, made this feel so special for us. You can tell from meeting him that Neal is passionate about marriage and celebrating love but also extremely conscious about what makes marriages LAST. He never forgot to remind us that the wedding is the wedding, but this is for your whole life and we're constructing the words that will carry you through that life. His resources that he provides for helping build your ceremony are incredibly helpful and his additions to our "script" from our first draft to our final were always thoughtful and made an impact on our ceremony in ways that we could never come up with. He has a strong, calming voice and all of our guests (and of course, us) thought this timing and even small, comedic relief when necessary were the charm that made our ceremony so unique to us and so enjoyable for everyone to witness. Neal, we can't thank you enough for being apart of our journey.

We had such a wonderful experience with Jim as our wedding officiant. He was incredibly responsive from the very beginning and so personable throughout the entire process. It’s clear he is passionate about what he does. He took the time to understand what we wanted and was very accommodating in tailoring the ceremony to fit our vision. He even incorporated a beautiful butterfly release into our ceremony, which made the moment even more special and memorable. We couldn’t have asked for a better officiant and highly recommend Jim to anyone looking for someone who truly cares about making their day unforgettable.

From our very first meeting, it was a pleasure to work with Rabbi Stein. He laid out exactly how our ceremony was going to proceed, and he made us feel at ease in terms of asking questions and making adjustments. Rabbi Stein was in complete control throughout the entire process, up to and including the ceremony, and his sense of humor and depth of knowledge enriched our special day immeasurably. During the ceremony, his speech about us captured the essence of who we are as a couple and gave us the opportunity to reflect on our relationship. We strongly recommend Rabbi Stein as an officiant for anyone's wedding day!

Reverend Michael Callahan was the perfect officiant for our wedding! He took care from the very beginning to learn about us as individuals and as a couple, and put us at ease throughout the process. We spoke several times about what kind of ceremony we'd like & he provided us with an outline with different options. On the day of, he chose the most beautiful words to describe us and it went off without a hitch. Multiple times throughout the night, we received compliments on his words from our guests. We are so glad we found him to celebrate our special day!

We found Rev Deb through The Knot, and we were so lucky we did! She took so much time to meet with us on zoom and get to know us personally, and was so personable and kind. She was very communicative throughout the whole process up to and including the wedding. Let me tell you- Rev Deb knows her stuff! I didn’t realize how much goes into officiating a wedding. Originally we had wanted a friend to officiate, but thankfully we didn’t go that route lol. Rev Deb knew the whole process, from start to finish, especially with regards to the marriage license. We had a nondenominational ceremony, but still wanted to incorporate a little bit of faith from both sides (Catholicism/Judaism). She managed to be able to do that without making it a religious ceremony, but still honoring both our families. She’s extremely thorough and meticulous, gives you a lot of different options for things you’d want her to say or speak about during the ceremony, and really tailors the whole thing to you. The day-of can be hectic, and you don’t know until that day how important the role of the officiant is and you really need someone experienced to make the process quick and run smoothly before you walk down the aisle. Once she’s up there speaking she is just a beam of light. My guests loved her, and her delivery of certain jokes and sensitive/personal matters was perfect. She made a very awkward couple so comfortable in front of 150 people staring at us lol. Truly it was a pleasure having her officiate our special day, and I would recommend her to any couple any day. Thank you so much, Rev Deb!!

Pastor Bill was an excellent officiant at our wedding, and we are so happy we asked him to officiate our ceremony. Soon after contacting him, he asked us to sit down for a video call so we could get to know each other. After learning a bit about his background, his outlook on religion and spirituality, and his general style as an officiant, we thought he was a great fit for us. Once we agreed to have him as our officiant, Bill gave us an overview of a sample ceremony with many options ranging from very religious to very casual, including options for personal vows and cultural traditions. He was totally willing to help us craft a ceremony that felt authentic to us, and provided very helpful feedback and advice on our draft until it was perfect. On the wedding day, Bill arrived at the venue with time to spare. He was well versed in the process of signing the marriage license and walked us through it. At the ceremony, he spoke loudly, clearly, and with a warm expression. And he stayed for the cocktail hour and spoke with some of our guests, who all told us they enjoyed his conversation. Many thanks again to Pastor Bill, and we hope this serves as our highest endorsement!

Robyn was so sweet and gives you options for each part of the ceremony to choose from so that it doesn't feel overwhelming to put together but you really feel like you can make it your own. She got back to me quickly anytime I reached out and even incorporated a last minute request I'd made the night before. Would highly recommend!
