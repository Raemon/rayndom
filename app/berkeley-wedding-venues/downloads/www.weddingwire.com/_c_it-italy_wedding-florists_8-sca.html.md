I couldn’t recommend my florist more highly. Planning everything from Australia was so easy thanks to their fantastic communication and professionalism. They provided a comprehensive quote, really listened to my ideas, and the inspiration they shared was perfectly aligned with my requests. They were also very open to edits, which made the whole process stress-free. On the day, everything arrived on time and the team set it all up seamlessly. The value for money was excellent, and the final result was absolutely beautiful — it set the tone perfectly for our wedding. They even created the sweetest little flower cart for my baby to be towed down the aisle, which was such a special touch. I truly loved everything. Thank you so much to Juri and the team for executing everything so perfectly.

First and foremost, Alessia is an incredible person. Her passion shows in the work she does, and her positive attitude is contagious. She worked with us and the constraints of our budget. She effortlessly adapted to our special requests for additional flowers for a Sofreh Aghd (Persian Wedding decorative table display). We are beyond happy and satisfied that Alessia was available and as far as I’m concerned we have made a friend for life.

We couldn’t have asked for a better florist for our wedding. Thanks to his incredible talent, the atmosphere was nothing short of magical – it truly felt like a fairytale.

I cannot say enough wonderful things about her. She truly created exactly what I had envisioned and brought it to life even more beautifully than I imagined.

We were looking for refined, elegant floral design and Carla exceeded every expectation. She has an exceptional eye for detail and a rare ability to create harmony without excess. Communication was clear and professional throughout, and even last-minute adjustments were handled with calm and kindness. The final result was timeless, sophisticated, and perfectly aligned with our vision. A truly outstanding professional.

I cannot say enough wonderful things about our florist! From start to finish, they were an absolute dream to work with. They took the time to listen to my vision and made it come to life in a way I never imagined possible. Every arrangement was breathtaking, and the flowers were fresh, vibrant, and perfectly coordinated. Their professionalism and attention to detail made the entire process stress-free, and I was blown away by how stunning everything looked on our special day. If you’re looking for someone who truly understands your vision and delivers beyond expectations, this florist is the one! Highly recommend!
