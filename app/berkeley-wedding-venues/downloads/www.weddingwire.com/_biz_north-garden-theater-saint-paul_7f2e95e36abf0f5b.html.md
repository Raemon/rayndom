Amazing experience at a great value

We held our wedding reception at North Garden Theater, and I could not imagine having it anywhere else. Ryan, Tina and Grace were incredibly helpful and attentive the entire evening! We really appreciated all of the personal touches they provided, (such as custom lighting, personalized cocktails, etc...) which made our special day truly unique. Our friends and family were constantly mentioning to us how impressed they were with the venue. We cannot recommend NGT enough!

Wonderful wedding venue!

We recently got married at the North Garden theater and we could not have had a better experience! Ryan and Tina work so hard to make sure to get all the details right and to allow you to customize just about everything you can think of at reasonable prices. Ryan and Tina are truly the best and you can tell they love what they do! One unique thing about them is that they are very transparent with pricing and what they offer, which can be difficult to find these days and we really appreciated that. If you book with them you will definitely be taken care of and they will go above and beyond to make sure everything runs smoothly for you. We are truly so grateful for how wonderful our wedding was!

Amazing experience!!!

We were having issues finding a wedding and reception venue and looked at North Garden Theater on a whim. Ryan & Tina were gems to work with! There were a few miscommunication spots but that wasn’t entirely on them, and they were fixed fairly quickly. Our guests had a wonderful time and loved the custom marquee we were able to put up with the help of Ryan & Tina. Over all, we would definitely use them again for another event. Really enjoyable over all!!!

A Dream Wedding Venue

As a couple who recently celebrated our wedding at the North Garden Theater, we cannot recommend this venue enough. The NGT combines vintage charm and elegance, creating a unique and unforgettable atmosphere for your special day.  
  
From the moment we began planning, Ryan and Tina were an absolute dream to work with. Their responsiveness and attention to detail made the entire process a breeze, and they were always eager to accommodate our needs and desires. They allowed us to customize every aspect of our wedding creating a truly personalized experience for us and our guests.  
  
The venue itself is beautifully renovated and offers ample space for guests to mingle, dine, and dance the night away. In addition to providing tables, chairs, and a stunning ambiance, the NGT also offers a state-of-the-art sound system, an amazing Karaoke system, dance floor lighting, and a customizable marquee message, adding a special touch to your big day.  
  
We truly could not have asked for a better wedding experience. The North Garden Theater not only provided us with a spectacular venue, but also the support and guidance of Ryan and Tina throughout the planning process. If you're considering hosting your wedding or any other event at the North Garden Theater, we wholeheartedly recommend it. Your special day will be nothing short of magical.

The best wedding venue ever!

Thank you so much to Tina and Ryan for the most wonderful wedding we could ever imagine. The North Garden Theater was perfect for all of the magic we have dreamed of for so long - incredible dinner and dessert, live band, karaoke, gorgeous tables and settings, and the lighting was magnificent. I feel so lucky to have been able to work with them! Just a joy from start to finish.

The perfect venue!

North Garden Theater was the perfect spot for our wedding reception! Ryan and Tina are a dream to work with - so responsive to all of our questions and on top of all the details. They easily accommodated our customized requests, and even had some special features we didn't think to ask for. It's reasonably priced, the space is fun and elegant, and I loved that we could plug our dance playlist right into their sound system! Their team is fantastic and made sure our party went off without a hitch. Highly recommend this hidden gem!

NGT is the best!

My wife and I recently used the North Garden Theatre for our wedding reception party and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Ryan was incredibly helpful with the planning process and timely in his responses to our questions. The venue itself was perfect for our needs. The team working at NGT were kind, and did a beautiful job. I would highly recommend North Garden Theatre to anyone looking for a fun spot to host a wedding or wedding reception!

Can't recommend enough!

NGT is amazing! Planning a wedding in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic had many challenges. It meant so much to us to have a vendor who was willing to work with us and help us create the evening we wanted. They quickly adapted to our needs as MN regulations changed over and over. Ryan & Tina were so easy to work with and planning the details was a breeze. They made sure all our tastes were accommodated.   
On the day of the wedding, Ryan, Tina and their son were on top of everything. They helped so much with decorations, sound, lighting and last minute tasks.   
The venue itself is unique and hip. So many of our guests commented on how much they loved the vibe of the theater. All the costs were up front and straight forward. So many of the other venues I looked at had extra hidden fees and requirements. NGT has dance lights and sound system built in, bar built in, great parking option, beautiful uplighting, tables, table cloths, and chairs all set up perfectly before we got there, etc. So many details that helped make the day go smoother.   
We really can’t recommend them enough.

One of the only good things to happen in 2020!

Trying to plan a wedding in the middle of a pandemic is just about the worst thing you want to have to stress about. We had booked NGT in 2019 for a 2020 fall wedding, so once everything was shutting down we had to put our plans on hold.   
  
Throughout all of this, Ryan was very communicative and flexible with our up-in-the-air plans. One of Ryan's top priorities was making sure that I was as stress-free as possible. Ryan and Tina are truly amazing at what they do and offer some of the best customer service I've ever experienced. I feel so lucky to be able to look back on my wedding day and have nothing but awesome memories!  
  
For folks who are still not sure if NGT is the right venue for you, let me ask you this: If North Garden Theater was able to give us a flawless wedding during covid, then can you imagine how amazing they are with everything else?

Simply Perfect in St. Paul

2020 has taught us to have flexibility and patience. Ryan and Tina are stewards of both. We were supposed to have our 145-person wedding at the North Garden Theater in April of 2020 – but like the rest of the world – everything was turned upside down due to Covid-19. We chose to dial back our guest list to just immediate family, and hosted a much smaller version of our wedding and reception at the North Garden Theater in August of 2020. Not only were Ryan and Tina incredibly flexible in allowing us to move our date – they were eager to provide creative solutions on how to make a smaller event work. Throughout the entire process they were extremely easy to work with and were timely in all their communications. They were very accommodating during our set-up and tear-down; and even provided a few extra special touches to really make this an unbelieve experience for us. We cannot recommend the North Garden Theater enough – especially for anyone looking for a beautiful, safe venue for their weddings/receptions during this pandemic. The North Garden Theater encapsulates St. Paul; the venue space is beautifully renovated to represent historic St. Paul. It’s simply gorgeous. Now because our overall experience was so fantastic working with Ryan and Tina and with how beautiful the venue is; we plan to have them host our larger gathering in May of 2021. We are very much so looking forward to working with the NGT again next spring! We highly recommend them!
