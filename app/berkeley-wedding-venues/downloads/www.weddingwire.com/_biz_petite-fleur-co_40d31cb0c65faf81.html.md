Kind, Creative, Respectful of Budget

Sydney is so personable and willing to get creative to stay in budget. My parents thrifted some cool clay vases and glass bottles for the reception and Sydney was one of the only florists I spoke to that was willing and excited to work with them.  
  
During the planning process, I was feeling intimidated by all the details of the florals and asked Sydney to create them based on a few inspiration photos. I  
  
'm so glad I trusted her with my vision! She incorporated all of the unique pieces, matched all of our wedding colors, and created a full, textured look for bouquets, boutonnieres, corsages, table settings, and arch decor - all within our budget.   
  
On the day of the wedding, Sydney showed up on time with all of the florals and worked with the wedding coordinator to install them. She was super friendly and easy to work with. I can't recommend her enough!

The BEST Decisions You’ll Make! HIRE HER!

Not sure how or where to begin on this review… Petite Fleur Co made my wedding! Sydney understood my vision and exceeded all of my expectations. I hired Petite Fleur Co as my florist and wedding coordinator and have absolutely zero hesitations recommending her services! I cannot thank her enough or truly put into words how amazing she did.

Absolutely the best experience ever!

I wish I could give Sydney 6 stars! Where do I start? First of all, Sydney (owner), is fantastic! Her vibe is super sweet and kind. She was not only our florist but she was also also my day coordinator and she did an amazing job! This lady is punctual, responsible and have a great taste and talent with flowers! Her staff was also super friendly and overall, she made the experience so much better! I cried when I saw my bouquet because I couldn't believe how beautiful it was! Beautiful person, extremely professional, I wish her all the best!

A True Miracle

Absolutely magical! Reached out to Petite Fleur Co with a sliver of hope, assuming that I was asking too last minute or wouldn’t be able to afford services. They asked me what my budget and dream wedding flowers would be and they made it work for me! I don’t think it could’ve turned out any better and it couldn’t have been achieved without all the help and support the this company provided just a month or two out from the ceremony. My flowers, the service and everything about my experience with this company is 5 stars!

Floral dream come true!

I usually don't do reviews, but I cannot speak highly enough of Petite Fleur! Sydney and the whole team made my floral dreams come true. From the outset, Sydney was present, so knowledgable, and completely understood my vision. I love how she listened to my aesthetic goals, and made subtle suggestions as to certain flower arrangements based on her experience. It was obvious from their Instagram that it was my whole wedding vibe (chic, outdoor, high-end designs), and they did NOT disappoint!! The floral designs were beyond what I could have imagined. Everything on our wedding day was just ELEVATED by the florals. I truly feel so lucky! Trusting Sydney was one of the best decisions we made for the best day of our lives! If you want a hassle-free, high-end, dreamy wedding, Petite Fleur is the way to go. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

Gorgeous flowers & accommodating vendor

My husband and I had such a pleasant experience with Sydney and Petite Fleur. From the start, Sydney helped us hone in on the vision we wanted and accommodated our price range by giving us options and suggesting where we could repurpose or tone down flowers while still making our event look full and luscious. Our wedding day was a dream, and I can’t thank Petite Fleur enough for playing a part in it. We can’t wait to get our photos!

The best decision I made besides my husband. 

Choosing to work with Sydney was the best decision I made before saying I DO. She was not only the most organized, understanding, calming, dedicated, hardworking, and creative vendor we had but she was also my 1 stop shop person as far as putting on our wedding. She not only made sure I had everything I wanted but she also made sure I had everything I didn’t know I wanted. I can’t stress enough that from a floral perspective, SHE IS THE ONLY CHOICE, but also if you’re looking for someone that can make sure your day is perfect from start to finish —- she was IT. I’m not sure how she translated: “ I want a vampire moody sexy wedding with a yoga dream vibe” into THE MOST BEAUTIFUL REALITY EVER. Our friends and family still talk about our wedding and how flawless everything looked and was. Thank you Sydney, anyone would be a fool not to work with you genius woman!

Wedding florals- Petite Fleur Co.

When we were in the early stages of planning our wedding, it was easy to become overwhelmed. We knew choosing Petite Fleur would bring us peace of mind. After meeting with Sydney, brainstorming ideas, and finalizing details, we were confident she would create exactly what we envisioned. When we look back at our wedding photos, the flowers still catch everyone’s eyes. It was a special day, and I am so grateful Petite Fleur was able to be a part of it.

Best wedding planning decision I made 

When it came time for wedding planning I knew my most important budget would be for flowers. I didn’t have a wedding planner and made most wedding decisions myself but flowers were not one I wanted to DIY. Picking Petite Fleur was the absolute best decision. I followed Sydney’s floral arrangements on social media and knew they were really unique and my taste. I shared with her my Pinterest photos of arrangements I liked, colors, flowers, and general vibe. Our consultation got me really excited at the possibilities. She did a great job of understanding my budget and working with what information I gave her to deliver amazing results. Sydney provided the wedding party arrangements like bouquets and boutonnières. She did all the table arrangements, spacing out gorgeous vases with Japanese Ikebana styled arrangements and candles. She was onsite at the venue making sure everything was aesthetically pleasing. All of my guests were blown away by how unique, beautiful, and intimate the arrangements were. My bouquet was my absolute favorite! My experience far exceeded my expectations. Petite Fleur made my whimsical fairy tale wedding dreams come true!
