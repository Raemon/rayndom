The Davidson Center was the PERFECT place for our wedding reception. We had about 650 guests, and the facility was perfect for our needs. Lindsey and the special events staff met our every need, and they were always available via phone or email and quick to return calls. The space is beautiful and great for a reception with dancing, and the food was delicious. The chef worked with all our dietary needs and offered a wide variety of menu options as well. It was the perfect place to celebrate our wedding!

Think of how many people you will have attending. Landmark Park was the place in the Dothan AL area that had plenty of room for all our guests, and enough space for our outdoor wedding! If you want a rustic atmosphere for your wedding I recommend Landmark!

We used the zoo as our venue for our wedding and rehearsal. All the staff helped and made out day perfect! We had the Italian lunch buffett and the food was amazing! Overall I cannot recommend the zoo as a venue high enough!

This is a wonderful place for a small wedding and reception. We had my mother's 75th birthday party here, and the director is very helpful and accommodating. It has a beautiful staircase for a bride to walk down!

Lil Parton is so incredibly kind and she worked with me to make my reception PERFECT. We were in the Loretta Spencer Hall in December so we overlooked Big Spring Park which was decorated for Christmas. It was magical. I was so pleased! I would certainly recommend this non-profit venue! It is FABULOUS!
