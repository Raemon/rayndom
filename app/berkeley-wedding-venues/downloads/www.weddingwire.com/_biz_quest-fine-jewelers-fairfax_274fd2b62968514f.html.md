A True Dream

Allison and the team at Quest has truly captivated me beyond words! I came in here driving by just to compare prices for engagement rings. I had general ideas of what I liked but I wasn’t really satisfied with anything I found online or at the other store I visited. Without an appointment, Allison took us and transformed my experience. She was so thorough and detail oriented. She was dedicated and all in on getting me EXACTLY what I wanted. She made sure that every single detail from the exact sizing of the halo to the contouring of the band was perfect. She had complete patience with all of my questions and admitted anytime she wasn’t certain about something. Then she brought in other representatives from the designers to make sure it was exactly what I wanted. I’m incredibly type A as a person and having someone who met the challenge of nailing my vision was so amazing. In making the investment that you do for a wedding set, you could not go wrong with Allison and Quest. The experience here has blown me away and set my expectations for jewelers moving forward. You won’t regret choosing this business.

Great Customer experience!

Quest Jewelers has a vast selection of Jewelry to choose from. Randa was amazing to work with, she helped us select not only our engagement ring but our wedding bands as well. I recommend Quest Jewelers to all couples!

Wonderful experience

My fiancee took a family diamond to Quest to make into my beautiful engagement ring. We then went back for my wedding band, because their customer service and prices were so wonderful. Additionally, they clean and re-size your ring for life!

So professional and very customer service oriented

We are so happy with Quest. We bought the engagement ring through them, and I was so happy with their service, we bought our wedding bands through them as well. We also are required to go back at least once every few months to have the rings cleaned, and we are welcomed back any time we’d like; if we prefer to have rings polished more frequently.

Amazing, Start to Finish

I can't recommend Quest's services highly enough. From my very first interaction with Huan, to each subsequent interaction with Huan and Randa. They were absolutely amazing. I was referred to Quest/Huan by a personal friend, when I began my search for an engagement ring. I had previously browsed online, walked into a few stores and window shopped, just to get a feel for things.   
  
Nothing could compare to the attention and service that they provided. Low pressure, knowledgeable, extremely pleasant. Just really FUN to work with. Even when we encountered hiccups along the road, by no fault of their own, they continuously would go above and beyond to make things right. Extremely accommodating. Top notch service.   
  
They're local, they're accountable and they truly value happy clients. They're not just there with you for a quick sale. They're there with you through the entirety of the process, and promise to be into the future....and have been.  
  
If you're uncertain of where to start, in your quest for that special ring for that special someone....start here!!

Finding the ideal ring

During my fiance's (now husband) initial search for a ring, he spoke to and visited multiple establishments. He also scoured through countless online reviews and found Quest Jewelers to be consistently on top of every list available. It wasn't long after that he visited Quest's newly remodeled store in Merrifield.  
  
The store is pristine, clean and organized. The variety is impressive, wide and extensive. Although what made this entire experience stress free is attributed to Huan's calming temperament and laser focus on 100% customer satisfaction. He knows all of his customers' names! He was proactive, asked all the right questions, and a perfectionist throughout. It was clear he was highly experienced and walked him through many aspects I quite frankly wasn't aware of. Huan worked tirelessly in his preparation to locate the ideal ring and our entire wedding journey wouldn't have been so seamless without his hard work and dedication.  
  
Thanks to Huan for making a typically anxiously-filled experience so comforting. For those interested in a jeweler for any special event, not only will you (and significant other) enjoy a remarkable experience & product but you'll also work alongside a very talented professional.

Engagement Ring and Wedding Bands

Quest was absolutely fantastic in designing my engagement ring and helping my husband and I with our wedding bands. Randa and Pete were a joy to work with. They care about their customers and offer extremely fair prices. You can expect a great deal and extremely high quality both in the products and the service provided. They also offer a wide selection and are certainly helpful in finding exactly what you're looking for. We would highly recommend to anyone!

Wonderful and easy to work with

Randa was amazing to work with! My fiancé and I went in because they were one of the few who carried Verragio rings. I tried some on and didn’t fall in love with just one. I liked certain aspects of 4 different rings. We left with an idea of what I wanted and my fiancé went back later and had a custom ring built with the details of all of the rings I liked and a diamond that has been passed down through from his grandmother! Once I got the ring, it fit like a glove! Shortly after we went back to have it appraised, they did it in house and took less than an hour! We will definitely be buying our bands from them soon!
