Beautiful venue, great service

Jan was absolutely great!!! We went with waterfront weddings because of the atmosphere, friendliness, and it was very reasonable! Anytime we had questions Jan was always available. Our wedding day was beautiful and everyone was super great and made our special day a day to remember!!

We had a fantastic experience

For what we wanted, and paid for, we were pleased with what we received. Jan’s home and grounds are beautiful with plenty of photo op locations. Jan worked with us when postponement was necessary. She was great from beginning to end!

All I can say is WOW!

Jan is awesome, she makes things so easy and is so passionate about making sure your special day is just how you want it to be. We had a big group and everyone was so impressed with the venue, the food, & the beautiful scenery. The cake & flowers were gorgeous, just as I pictured. Jan is so accommodating, the time went by so fast, she helped to keep everything on track. I feel fortunate to have found Waterfront Weddings! Thank you so much to you & your staff
