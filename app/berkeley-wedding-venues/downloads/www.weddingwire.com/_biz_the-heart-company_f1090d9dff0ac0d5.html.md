Wdding Love in a Heart-shaped Bottle

If you’re looking for a perfume that combines elegance with a touch of romance, Wedding Love from The Heart Company is a great choice.   
The heart-shaped bottle is a beautiful addition to any vanity; it’s almost a blend of sophistication and a sense of joy.  
The fragrance has a fresh and uplifting scent that’s perfect for everyday use or special occasions, it’s more subtle and not overpowering.  
I bought Wedding Love for my niece, and she absolutely loves it, so I plan to look into other fragrances from The Heart Company as gifts for other occasions, as well.  
Highly recommended!

Perfect Wedding Scent

I discovered Wedding Love and chose it as a gift for my best friend’s wedding. The heart-shaped bottle looked stunning while the fragrance itself was soft, and refined. The perfume has perfectly captured what a wedding scent should embody!

sentimental journey

My best friend was getting married last month. I wanted to get her something special and non-traditional. I purchased Wedding Love perfume from The Heart Company. She cried, I cried. But she sprayed on the perfume and a smile came to her face. Now every time she wears it, she thinks of that special day.

The Scent of Love

I gifted my best friend the Wedding Love perfume for her to give to her soon to be daughter-in-law. What better way for her to express her love on her son's wedding day. Every time Emily wears the perfume, she can experience the love her mother-in-law has for her. I told my friend Eileen, that gifting a perfume is a subtle way to let Emily know how she feels about her, and something Emily can wear everyday.  
  
Wedding Love is my go to gift for any bride, and mother-in-law's. What better way to be reminded of family and love and the future memories they will make.

A scent tied to her special day 

I bought Wedding Love as a bridal shower gift for my friend, and it turned out to be the perfect choice!🤍 She opened it and immediately lit up, it felt like such a thoughtful, special present. All night she kept saying how much she loved it, and I could tell it really made her feel celebrated.  
  
What I love most is that it’s vegan and cruelty-free, so I felt good about gifting it. It’s one of those gifts that feels personal and meaningful, not just another thing on the shelf. The scent feels timeless. It is something that will always take her back to that special day😍

The bride was so happy - the best gift! 

  
I gifted Wedding Love to the bride on the morning of her wedding. She teared up when she opened it — such a thoughtful, beautiful scent for such a special moment. The Heart Company truly understands romance.
