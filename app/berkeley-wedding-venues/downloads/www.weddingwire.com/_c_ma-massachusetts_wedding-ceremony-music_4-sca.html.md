We wanted to find something unique to add to our wedding and 3 Ring Creations did just that! The champagne skirt at cocktail hour was a huge hit and the aerial performance was breathtaking! Peter really listened to what we wanted and delivered a one of a kind experience on the most important day of our lives! Highly recommend to any couple looking to add something special to their day.

Jason performed at the cocktail hour and throughout the dinner at our daughter’s wedding on October 11. Although our daughter’s reception was fabulous and beautiful in every way with gorgeous everything, it truly would have been missing a critical element had Jason not been there to play. We had never heard him before and relied on the information available about his talents, but he was way more than we could’ve imagined. I want him to play for us many many times over! I was so busy that night as the mother of the bride and wish I could’ve just sat down and listened to everything he played. It was wonderful!

RD was amazing! My wife is a musician, and had many musical people at our wedding. We received numerous compliments on the performance, and it truly was one of the highlights of the day. His playing was excellent, adding an amazing undertone to the vibe of our event. RD was even able to learn completely new music at our request, which in my opinion is above and beyond expectation. Communication was timely, and easy to understand. I would highly recommend RD for any wedding.

We got married in June and had the cello and violin duet at our church ceremony. It was such a beautiful touch to our ceremony. Rebecca was so great to work with and was very understanding about the logistics for a church ceremony. They played such a beautiful variety of music for our guests to enjoy. We loved the range of songs that they offer to play. What a magical moment to have the strings as I walked down the aisle.

Shelley was absolutely incredible. We are so lucky to have found her for our wedding ceremony. We held our wedding at Granite Links and had a very large bridal party. Shelley played romantic and fun harp tunes while guests arrived. When it was time to walk down the aisle, Shelley and a violinist performed a ballad version of "Dance with Somebody" which was incredible. She also learned a special song for the bridal entrance from the musical "Hadestown" without hesitation. Shelley always said yes and was extremely organized when planning. She made us feel very comfortable and well taken care of. The ceremony was our favorite part of the day and she helped to make it so. If you are in need of live musicians for your big day, look no further. We are so grateful for her talent, musicality and kind nature. Thank you for being such an important part of our love story!
