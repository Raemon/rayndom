What can I say about Alex that hasn’t already been said by every single guest at our wedding? From the moment he started, he took control of the night and turned our reception into the ultimate party. He didn’t just play songs—he owned the vibe, read the crowd perfectly, and delivered an unforgettable experience that had everyone on their feet, dancing, and even chanting for “one more song” at the end of the night. Our wedding was the perfect mix of love, joy, and celebration, and Alex made sure the energy stayed high all night long. He had a perfectly curated playlist and expertly mixed in requests from our guests. No matter what genre or style they wanted, he handled it like a pro. He even kept the transitions smooth and seamless, never missing a beat. People couldn’t stop talking about how great the music was, and we received so many compliments on how the entire night felt so effortlessly fun. Our feet were sore from dancing, but we wouldn’t have had it any other way. Alex didn’t just DJ our wedding; he made it a celebration that people will be talking about for years to come. If you're looking for a DJ who can read the room, keep the party going, and leave your guests begging for more, Alex is your guy. He made our wedding a night to remember, and I have no doubt he’ll do the same for yours. Highly, highly recommend!

Our wedding was 2 years ago and we still get told by friends and family that our wedding reception was the best they’ve ever been to. Without a doubt this is credited to Danger Party. Their energy is unmatched and they put on an exceptional show. We were so fortunate to have a full-blown concert as wedding reception. It really was the best day ever.

Diamond Empire Band captured the mood of our guests perfectly. Our evening started with cocktails, and the band provided a jazz trio for that. At the reception, the dance floor was filled for the entire evening. Our guests danced the night away! The band members were enthusiastic, when kept the momentum going. What a great band!

BEST BAND IN THE LAND! Choosing Retro Boogie Band to play at my mother's 70th birthday celebration party held at Hotel Lumiere in downtown St. Louis was one of the best decisions I've ever made. From the outset, they are so professional, easy to work with and accommodating. They were wonderful at reading the crowd and keeping everyone dancing throughout the evening. Our guests are still reaching out to us with compliments on how good RBB was!! Do not hesitate to book Retro Boogie Band for your next event.

Downtime Band is responsible for making our wedding one to remember! We were married Oct. 16, 2021 in Springfield, Mo. and we STILL have guests talking about how amazing Downtime was! "I never left the dance floor the entire night," is what pretty much every guest at our wedding has told us. My husband, myself, and my family will forever be grateful to Downtime for creating the most amazing party and memorable wedding for all of our guests. Don't hesitate to book them for your wedding!

They literally made are party come to life. They were a pleasure to work with. Everyone agreed if you didn’t have fun at our sons welcome to the wedding weekend party at the St Louis Club; you just didn’t know how to have fun. Thanks to the band we all had a blast!!!!!

We hired PTL for our July 20th wedding in Indianapolis. Sam was great to work with leading up to the event, very attentive and quick to respond, flexible, and able to make me feel confident heading into our wedding weekend. We had the jazz trio for the cocktail hour and 9-piece band played consistently from 8-11. The band put on an amazing performance for our reception. They did a great job at keeping the energy up the entire night (we request that they play very few slow songs) and people of all ages were dancing all night. So many guests commented to us how great the music was and we heard "best wedding band" over and over again after our reception.
