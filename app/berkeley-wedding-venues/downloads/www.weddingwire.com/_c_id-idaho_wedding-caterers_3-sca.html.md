4.8 out of 5 rating 

4.8 

Jo was so easy to work with and so kind. She was responsive and professional and had a great idea of what we would need for our wedding. Jo's bar set up one bar during cocktail hour and moved it all in about 5 minutes to set up another bar for dinner and dancing. We didn't even notice! They were extremely affordable and even though we ran out of alcohol, Jo was able to bring us more to quench our thirsty guests!

Windy Clark and team went out of their way to ensure that our daughter’s destination wedding and reception in Jackson Hole, Wyoming was exactly what she wanted and more. The food was exceptional, with many of the guests stating it was some of the best food they had. Windy also assisted with the planning since we lived so far away. She visited the wedding and reception locations prior to the wedding and advised of travel times, and assisted with charter bus services. The price for the services provided was less than other caterers. Donna Veno, Kentucky

Seriously. I love Cat. We would be besties if I had my way. First of all, with the tasting, the time that worked was on a day our kids were with us. I asked Cat if they could come and she was like, “Uh, duh.” The kids had SO much fun doing the tasting with us and Cat. Then, she wasn’t available on our wedding day. And that was disappointing but only because I missed her vivacity. Her team was absolutely incredible. They were seriously so great. And our guests all commented about on both the food and level of care from Cat’s staff. I actually had a couple people ask me for her contact info for their events, not even weddings- they just liked the food that much. 10/10 Highly Recommend

Big K BBQ was an absolute dream to work with for our Saturday wedding in McCall on September 14, and we couldn’t recommend them more highly! Their professionalism, exceptional quality of service, and seamless communication made our big day stress-free and truly memorable. For dinner, they served a mouthwatering feast that included pulled pork, chicken breast, mac & cheese, BBQ beans, pasta salad, and cornbread. The food was phenomenal—meats were tender and juicy, the mac & cheese was creamy and perfectly seasoned, and every dish was prepared to perfection. They even went above and beyond by offering a variety of BBQ sauces tailored to different taste preferences and including dinner rolls, ensuring every guest was delighted. Despite serving over 130 guests, there was more than enough food, and the rave reviews from our friends and family kept pouring in all night long. What impressed us even more was their ability to accommodate a last-minute request to add appetizers, including chicken and veggie skewers and jalapeño poppers. Their flexibility and dedication to making our day perfect were unmatched. We chose their buffet-style full-service option, and it was worth every penny. Their team handled everything with ease—from setup and plating meals for our guests to bussing tables and managing all takedown. They truly took all the stress off our shoulders, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in celebrating with our loved ones. Big K BBQ’s professionalism, attention to detail, and outstanding food were a highlight of our wedding day. If you’re looking for a vendor that delivers incredible service and delicious food, look no further. They helped make our McCall wedding unforgettable, and we couldn’t be more grateful!

We decided to go with a restaurant for our rehearsal dinner, and Louie's was a wonderful choice! The food was great, and the staff was very accommodating when our numbers grew last minute as we included extra family members. One of the staff members even came in and sang a Frank Sinatra song to my fiancé and I!

Big Sky Catering was great to work with and did a fantastic job at my wedding! Jonathan was very professional, experienced and helpful - he and his took care of everything smoothly and efficiently. The food was amazing and they were quick to help out with other tasks like setting up tables - something other caterers had refused to do. Overall they were wonderful and made a stressful planning process super easy!
