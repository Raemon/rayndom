Logan Thomas was absolutely amazing! His acoustic guitar during the ceremony and cocktail hour created the perfect atmosphere—elegant, warm, and memorable. At the reception, his DJ skills had everyone on the dance floor all night long. Our family and friends can’t stop raving about the music—it truly made the day extra special. Thank you, Logan, for your talent and professionalism. You were a huge part of what made our wedding unforgettable!

Kenneth is such a lovely professional to work with! He and his team take the time and care to make your special day exactly how you want it. The love and passion they pour into their craft is evident and the cello/violin duo was the perfect touch on our wedding day! I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for live musicians.

Tyler and her team have turned my wedding into magic. They played beautifully and very easy to work with, she always ready to reply to my questions and ensures I am aware of her plan. My mountain fall wedding was perfect and magical with her, definitely recommend hiring a harpist+violin combo for your wedding a.k.a Tyler!
