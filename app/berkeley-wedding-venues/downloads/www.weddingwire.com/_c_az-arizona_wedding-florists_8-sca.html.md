Choosing a florist was the scariest part for me because I felt a bit picky about what I wanted, and putting that vision in someone else’s hands felt risky. But Simply Beautiful exceeded every expectation. Brittany was communicative from the start. She gathered every detail and inspiration photo to fully understand our vision. Both Sheryl and Brittany were always so friendly and thoughtful. Even leaving extra florals on the side for our detail photos, which was a sweet and appreciated touch. The florals themselves turned out absolutely amazing. I was originally hesitant about the pops of red poppies since I usually gravitate toward deep wines and darker reds, but they added SUCH beautiful dimension and I ended up loving them. They photographed incredibly well and gave the arrangements the perfect touch of color. All our friends and family raved about the flowers. They were truly stunning. We’d absolutely recommend the Simply Beautiful team!

Alex and her team were incredible. As the maid of honor, I worked closely with Alex on the wedding day. Alex worked tirelessly to coordinate the vendors, create beautiful floral arrangements, and help us pull off a last minute rain plans. The wedding went off without any issues due to her attention to detail. Her services were invaluable and we couldn’t recommend her and her team more!

Grace was so sweet and did an amazing job in choosing the flowers for our wedding. I let her know our color theme and ideas and she matched the flowers wonderfully. Was great to see her the day of the wedding.

Douglas at North Scottsdale Floral is amazing to work with. For starters, our wedding was originally scheduled for May, but we had to postpone to October due to the pandemic. Before we had even decided to postpone, Douglas had already reached out to let me know that he would be flexible with us if we decided to move our wedding and that is exactly what he was! Douglas was also extremely responsive and made the experience very personalized for us. Two weeks before the wedding (after all the flowers had been ordered), we found out that our venue had made some changes in the structure that we would be getting married under that required a change to our flower arrangements for that structure. When my mom and I showed up unannounced at his shop to discuss these changes, he got to work quickly and made some adjustments that would allow for the redistribution of flowers to work with the new structure while still capturing the look we were going for. Most of all, Douglas knows his flowers!! I know very little about flowers, I just found pictures on pinterest that I liked either the style or the colors or some other features. Douglas took in all of these examples, along with pictures of our venue and samples of our wedding colors and made the most beautiful bouquets and decorative arrangements for our wedding. He even delivered and installed them for us despite our wedding being out of town and not something he typically does for out of town weddings. Overall, the experience with Douglas and North Scottsdale Floral was amazing and I highly recommend this vendor!

I had a vision for my flowers and Carlyn at Blissful Blooms was able to make that vision come true. She was extremely knowledgeable about the types of flowers I wanted, and the colors that came with those flowers. She helped me pick out stands and vases and was very satisfied with her service. I would 100% recommend Carlyn at Blissful Blooms!!

We had the pleasure of working with Cactus Flower in Scottsdale to plan a recent event, and we couldn't be more thrilled with the results. From the moment we first chatted, their staff exhibited a level of expertise and creativity that truly set them apart. We had a vision for a beautiful, simple, and elegant aesthetic, and Cactus Flower not only embraced our ideas but also offered insightful suggestions to bring it to life in ways we hadn't even considered. What impressed me the most was their ability to seamlessly blend our preferences with their professional expertise. The result was a stunning event that exceeded our expectations. The attention to detail was impeccable, and the entire process was made easy and enjoyable thanks to their friendly and knowledgeable staff. Cactus Flower also impressed with their pricing, offering great value for the exceptional service they provided. The delivery of their services was punctual, and the entire experience was smooth from start to finish. If you're looking for a team that combines creativity, professionalism, and affordability, Cactus Flower in Scottsdale is the perfect choice. We wholeheartedly recommend them for anyone seeking to turn their event dreams into a beautiful reality.

TWW Events did an absolutely amazing job with our wedding flowers. Everything was stunning and brought so much life and color to our reception. I had a last-minute panic when I realized I forgot to order a flower girl bouquet, and they handled it without any problem, quickly creating something beautiful on the spot. They also made a custom-built varmala for my spouse, which was absolutely incredible and so meaningful to us. The flowers were one of the most beautiful parts of the entire day and truly helped make the celebration feel vibrant and unforgettable. I am so grateful for their creativity, professionalism, and care. Highly recommend!
