If you’re looking to elevate your event with truly beautiful live music, then you should absolutely hire these talented ladies. They didn’t just play at our daughter’s wedding—they helped create the heart of it and made it even more magical. They were also wonderfully professional—punctual, easy to communicate with, and entirely self-sufficient. Their rich, elegant sound created a moment we will remember forever. We are so grateful for their talent and presence on what was such an important day.

Daniel was phenomenal and we couldn't have found a better classical guitarist for our wedding! He worked with us for months to pick music that was meaningful and appropriate for the setting, recommending different arrangements, showing very keen sensibility and taste across a variety of genres/styles, and going back and forth about specific edits and timing. He was incredibly accommodating to our multiple changes of heart about tone and style of music for the pre-ceremony. And on the day of he was an absolute pro, managing weather uncertainty and venue setup all around him, and then playing beautifully for the pre-ceremony and ceremony. I could not recommend him more highly.

Gregg was absolutely amazing to work with!! He played the music for our ceremony and I can’t describe enough how amazing he did! He played 1000 years as our bridal party walked out, 10,000 hours as I walked out, and here comes the sun as the recessional. His music was amazing and he was great to work with. He sent us pre recorded samples of our songs before the wedding and we absolutely fell in love. Highly recommend Gregg for any music needs!

I was beyond pleased with the Alouette Duo for our ceremony and cocktail hour. They were amazing and really pulled everything together that I envisioned. The music was peaceful and beautiful. They played every song I had requested and for the ceremony they faded music flawlessly. Even though we had an outdoor winter wedding, they were accommodating to us. They provided music outside to our ceremony via an amplifier and followed all cues provided by the wedding coordinator and officiant. They were very receptive to music selection changes and my emails always, answering back quickly. They even came earlier to extend their play time upon my request. Having live musicians was a perfect extra touch to make the ceremony even more magical. Each and every song was played beautifully. I would highly recommend the Alouette Duo--- highly professional, great music, and kind people.

Working with Bonnie was great - she is able to offer a lot of guidance in terms of classical music, and I was not easy to deal with! Her pricing is on par with what the VSO charges, the main difference is a more personalized service. To be completely honest on the day of I was so nervous I hardly even heard the music (other than the first couple of chords of my Canon in D), but a couple of people said that it was lovely, so I'm sure it was wonderful.

Absolutely. Lisa and her daughter were terrific. Planning a 'destination wedding' is difficult, but Lisa made sure the music was exactly what we were looking for. Her arrangement of our wedding song was also amazing, calling for a 'first dance' which was not initially planned for, but ended up being so perfect.

Adam Boyce is a wonderful choice for wedding ceremony music. We met Adam while he was fiddling at an event at the Calvin Coolidge Historical Site and my daughter knew immediately he was her first choice to fiddle at her ceremony at the Union Christian Church in Plymouth Notch, Vt the following September. He was one of the best vendors we contracted with at the wedding. He is extremely talented, creative, social and a delight to work with. In addition to the ceremony, he entertained our guests at the cocktail hour with a huge variety of tunes. His rendition of "Ashokan Farewell" brought tears to my eyes as my husband walked his daughter up to meet her groom. And "Haste to the Wedding was the perfect choice for their joyful recessional. You will not be disappointed if you are lucky enough to secure Adam Boyce as your wedding musician!
