Magical Day

Our wedding day at Blackhawk Country Club could not have gone more perfectly. We cannot thank Andrea and the staff enough for making sure the day went off without a hitch. Without her guidance and expertise I would have been lost. Thank you Andrea and the staff at Blackhawk again so much everything! We would highly recommend anyone in the Bay Area to considering this beautiful venue!

Everything right there

I didn't need to have any rentals - they did the tables, linens, catering and bar. I used their speakers for my ipod for music, had a green room for waiting. They had a back up room available for me in case of bad weather. Stephanie, my coordinator, was very helpful and available for questions.

This venue is GORGEOUS! We worked with Tania and she was wonderful. She was very helpful and always available to answer questions and/or meet if needed. From the start of our contract to the day of the wedding, we always felt like we were in great hands. The day of the wedding everything went very well. She made sure events kept to the timelines and guests new where to be and where to go. Our guests were very happy and had nothing but wonderful things to say. The food was GREAT and the workers were pleasant. I can't rave enough about this place. Décor is beautiful in itself so you don't need too much to decorate. The views are BEAUTIFUL. We definitely recommend this place!!

We had our wedding reception at Blackhawk. This venue was perfect. We fell in love with it at the first sight. Pictures don't do this place justice. You need to go and see the lovely pond in front of the clubhouse and the amazing venue!   
  
Another gem at this venue is the event coordinator, Annemarie. She was an angel! Without her, our wedding would not have been this amazing, thoroughly organized event. Major kudos goes to her, just read all of the amazing reviews on Yelp!

Wedding food is often just ok. I figured my steak, since they were cooking so many, would probably be a little over or under cooked. Nope! Ours was fantastic! Our guests went on and on about how perfectly cooked, flavorful and the beauty of everything on their plates. The bar packages are inexpensive and have great options. The grounds are gorgeous, of course. The staff are professional and courteous and go above and beyond your expectations. On my wedding day, I just knew that everything was taken care of. I searched hundreds of venues, and the value at Blackhawk was the best, especially for members.  
  
Annemarie Harries is the wedding coordinator. She worked well with me and my Mother-in-Law. She is warm, professional, friendly, prompt with communication. She made me feel very special as the bride. No details were overlooked.

We held our wedding and reception and Blackhawk CC. It's a beautiful venue. We had been at other events at Blackhawk and the food was nothing great so we decided to do the unthinkable. We did a buffet with crab and lobster, we took the salmon off and replaced it with a beef dish. So we had fish, beef and chicken. Everyone was raving about the food even though the relatives from the East Coast gasped at the thought of a buffet. Ann Marie at Blackhawk was our coordinator and she was wonderful.

Very easy to work with and flexible considering it is a luxury country club. One of the most elite places in the Bay Area and in comparison with other venues, very affordable. They offer a variety of catering options and are open to meet your needs. Ask for Kristin, she is great!!

Everything I asked for was not only done, but done at the highest professional levels. Everything was set up as we discussed, the service was amazing and the food even better. Guests couldn't stop talking about what a beautiful venue it was with the outdoor patio overlooking the golf course and the way the room was set up. The best part of all was the food. I had comments from guests that the banquet sit down style dinner was the best they had had at a wedding and better then some restaurants they had been to. I had to agree. There is nothing I would change about my reception.
