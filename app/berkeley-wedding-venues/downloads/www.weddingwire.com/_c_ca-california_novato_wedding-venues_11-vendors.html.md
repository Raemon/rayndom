I recently got married at Stonetree Estates by Wedgewood Weddings, and wow, what a location! From the moment we arrived, it was clear that this place was something special. The setting is absolutely stunning, and the venue itself is beautifully maintained. Their all-inclusive package made wedding planning seamless. The staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating, making sure everything ran smoothly from start to finish. They really went above and beyond to make our day unforgettable. Overall, we couldn't have asked for a better venue. It's a truly magical place that will leave us and our guests with memories to last a lifetime. I highly recommend it!

It all began when we stayed at IM (Inn Marin) 2 years ago when we wanted to stay for 2 nights just out of SF, a place with a pool and pet friendly. We were sold! Just off the freeway but wouldn't have known it. Comfortable, motor-lodge style rooms, air conditioned & clean! When we got engaged 9/2016 and were beginning our search, I knew IM would be our spot. It was becoming a larger wedding than I anticipated and when we met with the coordinator, Dana Marshall, all of my inhibitions were tamed. What a beautiful outdoor wedding we had - perfect weather for September, rooms available for numerous guests (shout out to Terri Rose for coordinating these for us), Rickey's Restaurant (on site) catered both our rehearsal dinner AND wedding! No 2 food appetizers, salads or entrees were the same (I'm in the business and variety and quality are very, very important to me!). Dana was awesome! Her team were awesome, the day was a dream come true! Let Inn Marin & Rickey's take care of you

My husband and I were elated to find Unity in Marin! We got married April 22, 2023 and the events and facility manager Ms. Debbie Sweeney Puma was such a joy to work with!! Her and my wedding coordinator got along so well! The venue was absolutely beautiful and fit our theme well which was enchanted garden. I recommend this place if you’re looking to do your weddings in your thing fit that nature look. They have a beautiful fountain where our ceremony took place and they are sanctuary was where we hosted our reception. I miss this place so much! I know if I ever came back to visit I would cry leaving. ❤️
