Busbee Events was created from a genuine passion for events and the joy that a well-planned, fun celebration brings to others. There’s something incredibly special about bringing people together, creating meaningful moments, and watching a vision come to life.

We believe wedding planning should be a fun and exciting process, not a stressful one. This season of life should be enjoyed, and our goal is to make the journey just as memorable as the wedding day itself.

When working with our couples, we treat you like a friend. Planning is a collaborative experience, and we work closely with you every step of the way to create a wedding that truly feels like you. From your first ideas to the final details, we’re here to support, guide, and celebrate alongside you.

Our approach is rooted in organization, calm guidance, and personalization. We believe the best weddings are thoughtfully planned, deeply meaningful, and intentionally designed to reflect each couple’s unique story. We take the time to truly listen to what matters most to you, then create a clear, organized plan that brings your vision to life. Throughout the process, we provide steady communication, trusted recommendations, and a calm presence — especially during the final weeks and on the wedding day.

Busbee Events is for engaged couples who want professional support without feeling overwhelmed, value organization, calm guidance, and clear communication, and want their wedding day to feel intentional, seamless, and stress-free. Whether you need full-service planning or just a little extra help along the way, we meet you where you are and tailor our services to fit your needs.

You don’t have to have everything figured out to get started. If you’re ready to plan a wedding that feels joyful, intentional, and uniquely yours, we’d love to work together.

Seamless, Stress-Free Wedding Experience

We were beyond lucky to have Lauren as our wedding coordinator for our October 2024 wedding, and she truly exceeded every expectation. From our very first meeting, she took the time to walk us through every detail—from decor and venue to the overall vision—asking all the right questions to understand our vibe as a couple. I came into the process knowing nothing, and she patiently guided me step by step, always showing examples so I could actually visualize everything.  
  
Over the next nine months, Lauren handled everything: tux fittings, wedding dress appointments and alterations, hiring and coordinating our caterer and DJ, and finding the perfect photographer and videographer—all within our budget. She was in constant communication with every vendor, which completely removed any stress for us.  
  
On the wedding day, her organization was unmatched. Every vendor was given a detailed binder with a clear schedule, and multiple vendors commented on how impressed they were with how smoothly everything ran. She took all the guesswork out of the process, allowing us to fully enjoy our day. Because of her, our wedding was truly the most beautiful and stress-free day of our lives. I couldn’t recommend her more highly.
