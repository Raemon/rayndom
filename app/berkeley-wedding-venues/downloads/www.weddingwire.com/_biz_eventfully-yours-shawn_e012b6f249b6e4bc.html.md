Exceptional Planner & Seamless Vendor Partner

I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating with EYS (Eventfully Yours, Shawn LLC) on multiple events, and Shawn is truly a pleasure to work with. She is consistently professional, organized, and punctual, which makes event days run smoothly from start to finish.  
  
Her communication is clear and proactive, and she maintains a calm, confident presence that keeps both vendors and clients at ease. Her team is equally impressive — always professional, friendly, smiling, and willing to help wherever needed, often going above and beyond their assigned roles.  
  
As a fellow vendor, I genuinely value working alongside Shawn and would confidently recommend EYS to any couple looking for a dependable, polished, and experienced event planner.

Want The Best? Plan with EYS!

The EYS team was amazing for my birthday party! Lashawn, herself, was hands on, from beginning to end, making sure the execution was on point. I’ll definitely book again!
