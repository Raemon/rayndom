Amazing Wedding Florist

I could not recommend Jenna enough. She brought to life my dream wedding florals from my bouquet to the ceremony. Everything was elegant and beautifully made. Although we were miles away, her communication was great and she ensured everything was confirmed and exactly how I wanted it before our big day. I loved my wedding bouquet so much that it is now framed in our home for everyone to enjoy!

Best Attention to Detail Florist Around

I can't express enough how thrilled I was with Jenna doing my florals for my wedding! From our very first consultation, Jenna dedicated so much time to understanding my vision. She patiently went through every detail with me, offering expert advice and creative ideas that I hadn't even considered. Her passion for flowers and design was evident, and I immediately felt confident in her ability to bring my dream come to life for our big day.  
On the day of the wedding, I was absolutely blown away. The floral arrangements were stunning, perfectly capturing the romantic and elegant atmosphere I had envisioned and she even went more above and beyond that I had asked. But the true masterpiece was my bridal bouquet. It was more beautiful than I could have ever imagined! The arrangement was absolutely gorgeous, and the flowers were so fresh for her traveling the day of the wedding. It was the perfect accessory and a true work of art that I will hold dear forever.   
Jenna's attention to detail, dedication, and incredible talent made all the difference. She truly went above and beyond to make my wedding day beautiful. I highly recommend her to any bride looking for a florist who is not only skilled but also genuinely cares about making your floral dreams come true.
