Truchas Peaks Place (TPP) was the perfect choice for our wedding! My (now) husband and I had recently moved to New Mexico, and most of our wedding guests were from out of state, so we were looking for a venue that could provide accommodations for around 50 people for a couple of days. We toured Truchas Peaks Place, fell in love, and booked it later that day! TPP was exactly what we wanted for our wedding event. We booked the main house and the Opus house, which provided us and our guests gorgeous mountain views from wrap-around balconies, a full lawn to set up yard games and a drive-in movie screen, and a beautiful library with sliding ladders. With TPP being so affordable, we were able to book the property for 4 nights and accommodate almost all of our guests. Instead of a "wedding day", we had a "wedding week" with the people we love the most and created memories that will last forever. TPP was the perfect venue for us, and I would recommend them to anyone and everyone! Would additionally recommend the site coordinator, Ashley, who is very easy to work with and incredibly knowledgeable about TPP. You can tell she works really hard to make every wedding special and cares about every group that comes through. Thanks, Ashley!

Hyde Memorial State Park was absolutely beautiful for our wedding ceremony and reception. It was perfect for our intimate wedding of 20 guests, but can accommodate larger weddings as well. It was the perfect place for my husband and I since we love the outdoors.
