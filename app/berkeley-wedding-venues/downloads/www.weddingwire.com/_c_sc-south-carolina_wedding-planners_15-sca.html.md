Nicole is amazing! I really can't say enough about how detailed andthorough she is. She has taken so much stress off of my shoulders in the entire wedding planning process. She has extensive knowledge, and if she doesn't know the answer to a question, she really takes pride and researching and getting as much information as possible, before giving me an answer. I was really impressed with the suggestions she gave us, to make our day so special. She gave us an extremely detailed timeline of when different tasks need to be done, which was super helpful. Getting married and planning a wedding is extremely overwhelming so l truly can't say enough positive things about my experience working with Nicole. Most importantly, I truly love how Christ centered she is, and how that bleeds into her professional work. It was extremely important to us that we worked with somebody who had a strong faith so we can incorporate our love for Jesus into our wedding day. Nicole helped us to make sure Christ was at the center of every planning stage, including the big day

We booked RSVP coordination for our day-of coordination and it was perfect! Samantha gave expertise to our questions throughout the planning process, was extremely responsive, and set our day up for success. Danielle and her team set up all of the decorations/tables exactly how I wanted and kept our day running smoothly! Myself, my mom, and my bridal party had to do nothing but enjoy the day which is exactly what we wanted. I would 100% recommend booking them.

We had the absolute best experience working with Jessica! We added on a Day of Coordinator towards the end of our planning process and I am SO glad we did - I truly do not know how we would have navigated the day without her help. About a month out our venue was not very responsive with our emails but luckily Jessica had worked there before and was able to answer most of our questions while we waited on the venue to get back to us. I knew I could trust her to handle anything that came up on the day of the wedding and my immediate family raved about her professionalism for weeks after our wedding. 10/10 would recommend!!!

Hiring MOD Events for our Wedding was worth every penny. Kara did an exceptional job at providing us with vendors that were perfect for our vision, but also within our budget. Kara was so involved with making our day as perfect as it could be. Anytime I would get stressed or nervous about anything we would immediately hop on a call and she would make me feel ten times better. She made our dream Wedding ceremony and reception come to life. It was so easy to trust her to make decisions whenever we needed help. I highly recommend MOD Events!

If I could give more than five stars, I would! Our wedding day was an absolute dream, all thanks to the incredible expertise and attention to detail of our wedding planner. From the moment we began working with her, we knew we were in good hands. She thought of every little detail, from the big picture down to the smallest touches, ensuring that our day was not only flawless but also uniquely reflective of us as a couple. Her organization and professionalism were truly unmatched. She seamlessly coordinated every aspect of the day, from vendor management to timeline execution, allowing us to relax and truly be present in the moment. Her creativity and vision brought our ideas to life in ways we never could have imagined, and her calm and reassuring presence throughout the planning process was invaluable. What truly sets her apart, however, is her genuine care and dedication to her clients. She took the time to understand our vision, preferences, and priorities, and went above and beyond to exceed our expectations at every turn. She anticipated our needs before we even knew we had them, ensuring that every moment was filled with joy and meaning. Our wedding day was more beautiful and magical than we ever could have hoped for, and we have our incredible wedding planner to thank for that. She truly is a master of her craft, and we feel so grateful to have had her by our side as we celebrated the beginning of our new chapter together. If you're looking for a wedding planner who will make your dreams a reality and then some, look no further. She is simply the best in the business. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for giving us the perfect day we will cherish forever.

Working with Stunning and brilliant was AMAZING! Dallas was the best of the best. We would not have changed one thing. Our rain plan (B) felt like plan A! All of our vendors and planners were perfect. They took care of us, our parents, and all of our guests. They knocked all of our socks off and we would recommend them to any one of our friends. We can’t thank them enough!

I had a wonderful experience planning my wedding with Engaging Events! Anna did an amazing job ensuring that our wedding went smoothly and captured our vision for a small, sophisticated Charleston wedding. Excellent value for money with the beautiful florals and everyone we worked with at Engaging Events was very friendly and professional. I would not have changed a thing!

Samantha and RSVP events went above and beyond for my wedding. It was so nice to not have to worry about a thing the day of. Samantha and her team had everything under control, even to the smallest detail. They coordinated all my vendors seamlessly and made sure everything we wanted came to fruition. I would recommended their services to anyone.

Working with Mike was honestly one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. When we first started looking for planners, I remember seeing Mike and immediately thinking, that’s him he’s the one. It really was love at first sight for me in the wedding-planner world. His energy, his style, his whole vibe… I just knew. And truly, I never regretted that choice for even a second. From day one, he was there — on our screens, in our texts, behind the scenes, somehow always calm and two steps ahead. And the part that still feels like pure luck is that he didn’t just plan our wedding… he also became our officiant. Having HIM marry us , someone we already knew, trusted, and felt completely comfortable with, was priceless. It made the ceremony feel intimate, warm, and safe. Not a stranger reading a script, but someone who had walked through every detail with us. It added a depth and familiarity to the moment that I will never forget. Throughout planning, he showed up for us at every level. He was there for big decisions, small details, emotional meltdowns, practical questions ….everything. He even came with us to pick rentals and shared his taste with me in such an open, fun way. I know some people don’t want their planner’s aesthetic mixed in, but I absolutely loved his. His taste genuinely elevated the day. I also appreciated how honest and open he was with budgeting. No pressure, no surprises- just clarity, reality, and helping us make choices that felt right for us. His vendor list is huge and incredible, but he was just as open and supportive with the vendors we found ourselves. And honestly? Every single vendor we had ended up being amazing. It felt like every piece just clicked into place and created this world that was cinematic and so genuinely us. Our wedding — to me — was the best in the world. And I truly hope every couple gets to feel that way about their own day. That feeling is priceless. And Mike was a huge part of making that happen for us. I really hope we stay connected with him, because when someone shows up for you the way he did, they become more than a vendor. They become part of your story. If you want a planner who is warm, dependable, talented, funny, honest, calm, and genuinely invested in your joy ,someone who will guide you, support you, and even stand beside you as your officiant Mike is the one
