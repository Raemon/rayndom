Margot made our vow renewal in Paris last year extra special! After watching videos on her Social Media, I was brought to tears so knew we had to have her perform at our 5 year anniversary event! We chose to have an opening song to set the scene which was perfect and then had an upbeat song at the end for our second 'first dance'. Margot went above and beyond, by fetching our umbrellas from the car when it rained (a sign of good luck, so I'm told!). We cannot thank Margot enough and we highly recommend her for your special occasion in Paris.
