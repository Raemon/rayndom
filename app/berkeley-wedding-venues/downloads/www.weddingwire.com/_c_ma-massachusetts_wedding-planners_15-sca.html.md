5.0 out of 5 rating 

5.0 

Amanda was our day-of planner for our wedding at the Crane Estate in Ipswich and she was fantastic: professional, organized, and warm. We chose her after meeting with a few other planners who talked of “perfection” and “elegance” on the “the best day of our lives”—their vibes were too intense and it was way too much pressure! We were so relieved when we met Amanda. She was down-to-earth and we loved that about her. She stepped in three months before to connect with our vendors, look over and fine-tune our schedule, coordinate with the venue, make sure we were on track with everything that needed to be done, and advise us on a few details we needed help with. She made sure that all of the hard work we put into planning was executed as we had envisioned. I’m a pretty type-A and highly strung person, but I felt so relaxed in the weeks leading up to the day and on the day because of Amanda’s leadership. She made sure that me, my husband, and our families had everything that we needed, checked in with us throughout the night with a big smile on her face, and also was at our rehearsal the night before. She felt like a friend. I highly suggest hiring her so that you can relax and be fully present on your wedding day.

We hired Yvonne for her full-service wedding planning and loved her! Our venue did not come with a coordinator, vendor list, or much of anything, so we knew we needed help with getting everything ready from the ground up. Additionally, I started graduate school and knew I would quickly get overwhelmed with the planning. What drew us to Yvonne is her philosophy that your wedding should be about YOU and that your guests walk in saying, "This is SO them". We also had a multi-cultural wedding with my husband's side being Korean, and Yvonne approached this with such grace and care. She truly delivered on finding vendors that could execute on our vision and assembled nothing short of the dream team (that we would have had zero chance of without her connections). I truly miss our check-in meetings and never felt like I couldn't speak up about something I was worried about or disliked. It was an amazing day, and it would not have been possible without Yvonne and her team.

Sussie is a phenomenal wedding planner. We did a ton of DIY for our wedding and she made sure we stayed on track and kept us organized. But most importantly for us, on the day of the wedding, she made sure that we actually got to enjoy all the things we created and planned. I feel like so many couples (but mostly the brides, let's be honest) don't actually get to have fun and enjoy their own wedding because they're so busy dealing with all the last minute details or changes. We got to sit down and eat our food, we got to spend time with people, and we got to spend time with each other because she kept things running smoothly behind the scenes. Highly recommended.

Nicole helped us plan this wedding and keep it together over 2 cancellations, which was a monumentally challenging task. We had so many changes of vendors and plans over this time and Nicole could handle all of this in her sleep. She is a seasoned professional and her years of experience truly show. She is also a very kind and warm person who is essentially a family member at this point! This helps her maintain excellent relationships with her common vendors which is to the benefit of her clients. I have no idea how she keeps everything together but we are SO glad she does!

Jodi Raphael and her team were outstanding and made our daughter’s bat mitzvah weekend completely seamless. They handled every detail from the service and transportation to the party itself including the music, entertainment/dancers, décor, vendor coordination, and day-of execution. This allowed us to stay present and focused on our daughter and the meaning of the occasion. Jodi and her team also planned a fantastic out-of-towners dinner the night before and a brunch the morning after, both of which were thoughtfully coordinated and ran effortlessly. Throughout the process, Jodi (and team) was calm, responsive, and incredibly organized, anticipating issues before they came up and keeping everything on track without it ever feeling rigid or stressful. The result was a beautiful, high-energy celebration and a truly enjoyable weekend for our whole family and friends (almost everyone noted it was the best party they had ever attended). We are very grateful and highly recommend Jodi Raphael to anyone planning an event.

Lauren is an exceptional event coordinator who was so organized, professionalism and helpfulness to carry out our vision at Sangeet Night. She went out of her way to do her research on Indian Fusion Weddings. She brought back her knowledge with seamless execution and attentiveness. At the Wedding ceremony and Reception she was equally professional and detailed oriented and executed the dream wedding for the bride and groom. Nothing was too much trouble. Lauren did as we asked. We highly recommend her.

Jamie was incredibly thorough, and did a great job making sure we were organized and on track. Her guidance was invaluable, and her knowledge of the wedding industry, the Cape, vendors and general tips and tricks made everything more enjoyable and stress free. We had the wedding of our dreams thanks to Jamie!
