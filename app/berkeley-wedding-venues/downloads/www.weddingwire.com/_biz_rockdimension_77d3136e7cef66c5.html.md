Jenny, Genevieve and the entire Rock N' Events team are the absolute best! We came to them with less than 90 days to pull everything together, and they jumped in immediately and had the wheels in motion on every single detail before I ever had time to weigh myself down with stress.   
  
With their help and guidance, we created and hosted a wedding and reception that was more incredible that we ever could have imagined! It was the most fun, the most beautiful, and the most amazing day of our lives! And to this day, our guests continue to gush about every little detail...asking when we throwing a party to renew our vows! Even the professional event planners who were in attendance as guests were gushing about how it was the best wedding they had ever been to!   
  
Jenny, Genevieve and the entire team are so awesome, well-connected, great at their jobs and instantly responsive at any hour of the day. And the day of the wedding, we didn't have to worry about one, single, thing! It was truly the most amazing day, and we are forever grateful to Genevieve and the team for making it happen.

Rock n' Events was the best choice my husband and I did for our wedding! We did a month coordination and our coordinator was Genevieve. She guided us through the wedding planning process and made it soooo easy! Our wedding day came out just the way we wanted and it could not have happened without the Rock n' Events team! You will not be disappointed, hire them immediately and request for Genevieve! ❤️

Where to begin! The Rock N' Events team is an absolute pleasure and honor to work with. The minute my fiancé and I spoke with Jenny and Alice, we knew with absolute assurance that they have to be a part of our big day! Jenny and Alice have such contagious positive energy and fabulous ideas to share with all of their clients. From the moment you meet them, you feel like a star. They text, email, call, and meet with us regularly so that we always know we are not alone in our journey. They even send us surprise treats via mail (the best!). Thanks to Alice, my fiancé and I are able to carry on with our full-time jobs without having to worry about coordinating meetings with vendors or handling any conflicts that come our way. Alice is always willing to speak with us regardless of the day, time, or place (she even emailed us from Hong Kong!). Alice reviews each of our contracts with the utmost detail and has our best interests in mind when it comes to negotiating pricing details on our behalf. She is so organized with tracking our budget, guest list, vendors, etc. and makes it so easy and enjoyable for us to update our master plan as well. I cannot recommend the Rock N' Events team enough! I am so looking forward to getting to know Alice and Jenny over the next few months as we continue on this wedding planning journey. I am excited they will be with us on our big day as both our wedding day heroes and our friends. Thank you so much for all you have done and, in advance, for all that has yet to come!

It was such a pleasure working with Jenny and her amazing team. They were beyond professional with their correspondences with us and vendors. Everything was just a simple yes or no answers from us because they made it that easy to plan our wedding! They were so amazing we asked them to plan our babies birthday party as well! Simply put Rock n Events is the best in the biz! (trust me when I say this because we've worked with countless party planners and they're all B grade compared to them!)

Hey WeddingWire Viewers!  
  
Just wanted to give you my review on Rock N' Events!  
  
My name is Tony and I married my Wife on March 15, 2014.   
Took nearly 2 years to write my review of Jenny @ Rock N' Events but I'm doing it!   
Jenny was very professional...I'm still so amazed at how my Wife and I were treated in her hands and work. As the Husband or Guy, my main goal is to remain relaxed and cool throughout the whole wedding process. I've heard stories where Guys were stressed out because they chose to do their own Wedding planning and everything. Well, I'm super freaking glad I was NOT them. Jenny helped me and my Wife by giving us plenty of options as to which vendors to work with, the venue, THE CAKE (my favorite part of the process) and more. I was not stressed, well...only when it came down to working with my parents and In-Laws. But, the whole wedding process went smooth as cake, no pun intended. My Wife and I are still shocked at how beautiful and smooth our wedding went...it was such a perfect day. We have that memory to fall back on all thanks to Jenny @ Rock N' Events...seriously. We highly recommend contacting her and still do with our friends, co-workers, and strangers because we want them to have a great experience with their once in a lifetime event, especially the Groom (because I was in their shoes). Thank you so much Jenny and the Rock N' Events Team!!

My wife and I were so happy that we chose Jenny and the Rock N' Events crew for our wedding. Jenny went above and beyond for us and made every idea we had come to life. We highly recommend them because you will get incredibly personalized service, they will always pick up your call or return your call within minutes (which was very important for us), and the quality of their work is top notch. I know everyone says this, but our wedding looked amazing and we got a ton of compliments. It was all Jenny.   
  
I wouldn't take the time to write this review if I didn't feel strongly about this company.

Rock N' Events not only helped us plan our wedding, they rocked it! I can't even begin to tell you how thankful I am to Jenny and her team for doing such an amazing job. I was honestly STUNNED when I walked into my own wedding. It was truly more than I could have ever dreamed of. Jenny is not only professional, she is also personable and VERY accomodating. From the very beginning, Jenny guided me through every step of the wedding planning process. She added her professional input and suggestions, while still keeping my vision in mind. Jessica was also a dream come true. She assisted me with my dress and all of the other details that went on behind the scenes the day of the wedding. I would consider the Rock N' Events team the dream team because they all work together so well and each of them bring something unique and wonderful to the table. I would have never been able to plan a wedding without Jenny and her team and I am FOREVER grateful for them. If you want your expectations to be exceeded, I would highly reccommend hiring the Rock N' Events team for your wedding!

Jenny & Jessica are our wedding planners. I can't say enough how grateful I am to have Rock N' Events to plan our wedding.   
  
Jenny is a very energetic & lovely person who makes the wedding planning less stressful & fun. She is also knowledgeable about wedding planning & industry. She is honest, so you know you can trust. Because we don't have much budget, Jenny helped us to find vendors who fit our budget but still have high quality of their work.   
  
Jessica is our day of coordinator. She is super nice and accountable. She also love craft. Lots of our decoration, including our lovely blush pink photo booth backdrop made by her & her assistants :)   
  
We won't be able to have a such beautiful & memorable wedding without Rock N' Events!! They are the best :) Highly recommend!
