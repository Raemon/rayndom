We had DJ Anthony Alvarez from TSG Weddings, and he was absolutely amazing! From the very beginning, he set the perfect tone for the night. I wanted everyone to have fun and be up dancing all night and Anthony made that happen! He seamlessly mixed in throwbacks, Latin music, and even some salsa, keeping the energy high and the dance floor full. Our guests are still talking about how incredible the music was! I can’t recommend him enough he truly made our reception unforgettable!

Greg with absolute entertainment was amazing! He was very professional and quick to respond to any questions I had. He is very personable and his planning form online was so easy to navigate and has everything you will need to help plan the music for your event! He kept the guests at the wedding dancing and everyone enjoyed the music! His wife rose with the absolute Photo Booth was amazing as well! The Photo Booth was beautiful and everyone loved it! We got the audio guest book which the guests loved and thought was an amazing idea. All in all a 10 out of 10! I’m so glad I chose absolute entertainment for our wedding!

Peter and Kevin were so great to work with. They were always responsive and were so insightful in helping my wife and me to plan out the audiovisual needs for our wedding. The Sound Choice Events team was extremely professional and thoughtful, and my wife and I loved working with them.

Danny was fantastic! From our very first conversation a year before our wedding, he was professional, organized, and always responded promptly. He was exactly what we were looking for in a DJ—personable, experienced, detail-oriented, and able to read the crowd effortlessly to keep the energy up and the event flowing smoothly. Danny made sure every one of our specific requests was included and executed perfectly. His professionalism and class stood out to us and were among the most important qualities we were looking for in someone to help run our big day. Hire Danny for your next event—he’s truly unmatched. He was an integral part of what made our wedding so special and unforgettable. -Haley & Kevin

Scott was incredible, bringing exactly the right energy all night long. He was quick to answer emails during the planning process and always helped alleviate any concerns I had as we got closer to the day. He even captured our private last dance, so we can have that memory forever. The dance floor was full from the second it opened and there was no limit to ages out there. Our friends and family loved the photo booth, too. Can't recommend him enough!!

Our DJ Charles was the best!! Our saxophonist was absolutely incredible. They truly made our wedding unforgettable. The music was flawless from start to finish, and the live saxophone added such an amazing, high-energy vibe that had everyone on the dance floor all night long. They both read the crowd perfectly and kept the party going nonstop. We received so many compliments from our guests about how fun and unique the music was. We couldn’t recommend them more- best decision we made for our wedding!

I had the pleasure of working with DJ Greg for my clients June wedding. To say the weather did not cooperate would be an understatement, but Greg was completely unfazed and kept guests happy and dancing all evening! I look forward to working with him again.

We found TCs DJ through good reviews and they did not disappoint. Originally we had considered forgoing a DJ, but we were extremely grateful to work with Anthony. Before the wedding day, he worked with us to help plan the day. He provided us with a form that went through every part of the day, asking us about our preferences and getting us to think about things we would have otherwise forgotten. He used this to compile our day of timeline. Throughout the process he used his ample wedding experience to help answer our questions and guide us. He was also very responsive throughout the process. On the day of, he kept the wedding going while we were distracted and being pulled in many different directions. The music always complemented what was happening and followed our requests. He made sure to save our specific song requests for when we had time to get on the dance floor. We heard horror stories about DJs during our search for one but Anthony did not fit the stereotype. He was chill, helpful, and respected our music requests while catering to the guests.
