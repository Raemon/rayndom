They provide a wide range of services that makes it a one stop shop and if they are not able to offer a particular service, the team makes it happens.

Where to even begin! When we first started planning our wedding at The Sagamore, I reached out to past brides for advice — and every single one said the same thing: “If there’s one vendor you absolutely have to hire, it’s Total Events.” They couldn’t have been more right! Michelle was an absolute dream to work with. She was quick, knowledgeable about both the venue and their incredible inventory, and truly helped us bring our vision to life. From our Friday welcome party, to the reception, and even our after party - complete with a casino package (tables and dealers included!) that my family still can’t stop talking about. When the forecast for our welcome party turned unexpectedly chilly, Michelle immediately jumped into action that morning, tracking down the last remaining space heaters and getting them onto the delivery van just in time for setup. That level of responsiveness and care is what sets Total Events apart. We were so lucky to have them as partners in our wedding weekend. If we ever host another event, there’s no question Total Events is the team we’ll call first.

If you are looking for someone to decorate for your wedding then VIP Wedding and Events is your go to. Carmen was very professional. We discussed budget and what I was looking for. She did everything that I asked for and it was beautiful. They set up and take down. They do an amazing job. You won’t be disappointed.

AYS was great to work with! They helped execute our vision supplying amazing farm tables, wine barrels, tent for the outside deck and all the chairs for our ceremony! I kept adding and removing items as the time got closer and AYS was so flexible and willing to work with me! Definitely a great vendor to work with!

The tent was one of my biggest concerns leasing up to my wedding day, but Shelby at Tremont Rentals made the process painless and was beyond helpful from start to finish. She always responded to my (countless) questions promptly and with kindness. She also really helped me understand the various options I had as far as layout and sizing, frequently generating 3D layouts of the tent so I could better understand the possibilities. I went back and forth on sizing a couple times and Shelby was extremely accommodating. I also commend her and Tremont for the overall look of the tent. It was beautiful and the clear sidewalls, which I was hesitant to use, looked very nice. Our venue manager even commented they were the best looking tent walls she’d seen!

Preferred Events brought my vision to life beautifully. They were always available to answer any questions and made the entire process feel seamless. The setup was incredible, every detail was thoughtfully done, and they truly transformed the backyard into a stunning space for our special night.

We loved working with GTC for our Wedding August 2021. They put up a beautiful clear span tent and white wash hardwood floors. Kate & team were excellent to work with - they were quick to respond, easy to work with, patient, kind, and detail oriented. There was no matter too big or small that Kate wouldn't carve out some time in her day to hop on the phone with me. They worked with us extensively to ensure that our our environment was level and ready for install, including multiple site visits. On-site during install and strike, the team was clear, polite, and worked quickly but thoroughly. As a bride and a producer in the events industry, I would absolutely recommend them for your next event!!
