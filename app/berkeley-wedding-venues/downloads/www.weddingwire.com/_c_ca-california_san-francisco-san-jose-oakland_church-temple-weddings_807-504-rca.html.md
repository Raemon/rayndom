Stunning location for an intimate & unique outdoor wedding ceremony. Incredible value. 180 degree & unobstructed view of Richardson Bay and the golden gate bridge from the top of Tiburon. Easy parking for guests- location is not even known by locals. Weather may be a little overcast and unpredictable but we were blessed with perfect weather in May. Our ceremony was on a Saturday morning - and both the bride and groom managed to get sunburnt! Christine was attentive and easy to work with. Thank you!

Chochmat HaLev provides a warm, beautiful intimate venue, perfect for a small and/or informal reception. (They also have a space available for a wedding for those who are Jewish!) They have a no-meat and no shellfish policy because they're a synagogue--check with the staff about appropriate food! The staff itself is warm, professional, patient, and helpful! There's a small, lush garden that can be used as an extension of the Social Hall. Their rental prices are competitive! Can't recommend it highly enough.

The back drop for the ceremony is STUNNING!! I love the large glass windows with the beautiful trees in the background. I can't even begin to tell you how thrilled we are to have our ceremony here. Cathy, the coordinator is super helpful and great with communication. Just as a heads up, she is quicker to respond via phone than with email. But overall, we are so happy with our venue.
