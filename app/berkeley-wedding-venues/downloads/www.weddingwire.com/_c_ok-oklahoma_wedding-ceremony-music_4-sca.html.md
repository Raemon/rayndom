Catherine Reed is fantastic - her recordings on-line don't do her live performance justice. She played "In My Life" and "Here Comes the Sun" for our processional and "How Sweet It Is (to be loved by you)" for our recessional. Her performance of "In My Life" had my mother in tears the first time we heard her play in Eureka Springs. She was also very accommodating. "Here Comes the Sun" was not one of the songs she already knew but she learned it for our wedding and did a brilliant job. As a typical bride, I emailed Catherine every few weeks to check in and switch the order of songs for the wedding and she always responded with kindness and patience. A beautiful voice, a serene spirit, and a consummate professional.

Emily is such a wonderful and talented woman. She was very professional and had a multitude of ideas for our ceremony music. I threw in a little trick, with a non-traditional song for me to walk down the aisle (Sigur Ros's Staralfur) and she took it and turned it into such a beautiful memory. Working with her was easy, and I can't imagine my wedding with anyone else! She really tied it all together.
