Sisters Wedding Creations were amazing to work with for my bridal shower. I showed them my ideas and what I wanted and they put it together, did set up and clean up without me having to lift a finger! It was perfect to know they had the decorations covered for the day and that I could worry about other things. I would recommend them to anyone wanting help with decor or just don’t know where to start!

Our puppy Bumi stayed at The Bed and Barkfast during our wedding weekend, and we utilized their wedding shuttle service. We were highly impressed with their commitment to getting Bumi relaxed and acclimated in a new location and their attention to our wedding timeline. It was SO special having Bumi at our wedding to be able to take pictures with him and also have him help us relax a little during our big day. The Bed and Barkfast goes above and beyond in their care for the dogs and families they serve, and we continue to use their services even after our wedding. I highly recommend them!

We rented our reception chairs from Elegant Events and they were absolutely perfect - beautiful farmhouse look with an off-white cushion. They were the perfect complement to our decor. More than that, Elegant Events was so easy to work with, from placing the order to updating our count a week or two before the wedding, everything was so incredibly easy.

We rented several items from A Special Touch Event Rentals for our daughter's January 2025 wedding at Saint John's Resort. Kimberly was absolutely awesome to work with. She provided suggestions, ideas, worked within our budget and assisted our florist and wedding coordinator on the day of the wedding to set up and decorate our reception space perfectly! The rental Chiavari chairs, chargers, linens and candles were excellent quality. Highly recommended!

We had a clear top tent. It was gorgeous. Very elegant and magical. Knights did a great job with our wedding. Their team was hardworking and helped us with our specific desires to make our day special. I would highly recommend.

Your Event Party Rental did an amazing job for my wife and I’s wedding! We had a 150 guest winter reception at The Whiskey Factory in Detroit, and they made the process completely seamless. We rented chairs, tables, associated items (linens, etc) and coat racks. Eileen couldn't have been easier to deal with, and was very quick to respond with new price quotes when we had to make changes. They were so easy to deal with, even a husband could do it!

Todd did a great job helping us design decor for our ceremony and reception. Everything turned out so beautifully and made the spaces extra special. He was flexible and really easy to work with. Two weeks before the wedding we added on some draping and he had no problem accommodating our request.

I rented a birdhouse card holder, it worked out great. The only complaint is that some of the wooden pieces were broken, but I was planning on dressing it up a bit anyway and my decorations covered it fine. Still worked out perfectly.

We aren't local to the Grand Rapids area but fell in love with a venue there. We quickly realized how high the prices were in the area and became worried. Lots of places had minimums, hidden fees, or just completely unreasonable rates. Rentalex was the complete opposite. We were immediately put in contact with Paige when I reached out about interest in renting flatware + napkins for our wedding day to bring my vision to life and she was super responsive and helpful. We even scheduled a meeting to go into the showroom and see the pieces in person to make sure they were the right fit. She was great about showing us examples and grabbing different napkin color swatches/fabrics for us to check out and make sure we were making the right choice for us. We ended up ordering napkins, flatware + delivery and set up. The cost was a FRACTION of what these other rental places expect. Their customer service, delivery, EVERYTHING was top notch and worth every penny. They were so easy to work with for our coordinator at the end of the night handing of the rentals too! Cannot recommend them enough for your future event plans.
