## About

Originally built in 1993 as Scott’s Garden, this beautiful garden space was reimagined in 2022 as an elevated venue for special gatherings and celebrations. Enclosed within red-brick walls and surrounded by lush greenery, it offers a warm, inviting atmosphere ideal for intimate dinners, milestone events, and pre-wedding occasions such as rehearsal dinners and welcome parties.

**Facilities and Capacity**

Prime Steakhouse & Martini Garden features several distinct spaces that can be customized to fit your event. The Upper Terrace is an outdoor setting with its own private bar and a customizable photo wall, perfect for mingling, cocktail hours, or small celebrations. Nearby, The Landing offers an open-air terrace with partial cover, making it suitable year-round for rehearsal dinners, welcome parties, and other pre-wedding events. Surrounded by trees and ambient string lights, it feels like a charming hidden oasis. For indoor gatherings, The Ballroom provides a spacious setting with exposed brick, warm lighting, and ample room for seated meals and social events.

**Services Offered**

The talented team at The Garden Walnut Creek has thought of everything when it comes to producing unforgettable events. They work with couples to make their dreams a reality. Catering is offered by our talented in-house chefs. Their tasty dishes are colorful, artistically presented, and made with high-quality, fresh ingredients. A snapshot of menu options includes delicious appetizers such as charcuterie cones, hummus crudité, and heirloom tomato burrata. Main courses such as salmon, steak, chicken, and eggplant parmesan are available for your selection, along with an array of salads, sides, and irresistible desserts. Looking for something else? You can also bring in the caterer of your choice. We handle all bartening in house and can work with you to create the perfect drink menu to compliment your event, whether that's a full bar, signature cocktails, or wine and beer only.

**Services Offered**

Our team is dedicated to creating memorable, seamless events. We offer in-house catering with menus crafted by our culinary team, featuring fresh, high-quality ingredients and beautifully presented dishes, from passed appetizers to entrée selections like salmon, steak, and vegetarian options.

Jamie the coordinator is a god send for a bride. I did my after party there and she was so sweet, so responsive and so flexible. I would HIGHLY recommend this spot. The venue itself it beautiful and it a great location. We had sliders, grilled cheese and pizzas which everyone loved.

Beautiful Spaces

I had my wedding at The Garden in November. Jamie was so helpful with the whole process. She gave bar suggestions, seating and ceremony set-up ideas, and more! She was very responsive and helped make our dream day come to life! The venue itself is beautiful. The ceremony space was perfect with the brick building, ivy, and cobblestone feel. The cocktail hour had a nice ivy feel and had a cool bar feature. The reception area fit all 100 of our guests, was beautifully set up and had the perfect space for a dance floor! We loved how everything came together and the space was beautiful. Thank you to Jamie and the bartender who was also quick and friendly! I highly recommend that you look into this new venue for your wedding or event.
