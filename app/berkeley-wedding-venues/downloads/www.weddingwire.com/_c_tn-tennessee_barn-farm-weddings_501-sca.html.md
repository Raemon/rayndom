The barn was beautiful. Everything turned out exactly how I envisioned it. I'm so thankful that we chose the barn at chestnut springs because Melanie and her team were just the nicest and most helpful people. I can't thank them enough for helping out to the extent that they did. I never once felt stressed because Melanie made sure everything ran smoothly for us. The barn was a beautiful backdrop to all of the flowers from our florist. I couldn't be happier.

We had our daughters wedding a Hillwood. This venue is amazing. Reasonably priced, conveniently located and beautiful grounds. Cindy was very helpful and responsive to our needs. I would highly recommend Hillwood for weddings.

As a former catering and events planner, I can’t thank Kayleigh and Nicole at Sugar Hollow Retreat enough for how amazing they were. Long story short, my original venue closed and canceled on me 12 weeks before my destination wedding. Needless to say I was panicking!! Kayleigh immediately responded to my inquiry and both her and Nicole were so responsive and empathetic through the entire process of replanning my wedding in 12 weeks! The venue itself is breathtaking and exactly what we wanted. I truly believe the stars aligned and our “take 2” wedding was truly what we were meant to have! As someone who has worked in the business, it’s easy to see that they are true pros. Thank you all for making our wedding weekend perfect!!

I booked the Lily Barn 7 month before my wedding after a catastrophe with another venue in the area. They happened to have my date available and were very professional out the gate. We met with their coordinator, Emily, at their office conveniently located in a Chocolate Bar(my husband loved this part). We went over ever detail and let me customize the level of services I wanted to use. They ended up doing our flowers, wedding cake, catering and rentals! It was such a relief to get those big items off my plate. I have to admit, I was nervous. I figured they'd be able to do one thing really well, but all four seemed like a stretch. I'm so happy I was mistaken! The flowers were stunning. I'm not exaggerating here, the florals were legitimately breathtaking. I expressed early on that I wanted a subtle Pocahontas meets Boho wedding and she seriously painted with all the colors of the wind with this one. I pulled examples from very different bouquets and she made it a reality. I gave her a difficult base(a large birch teepee) for the centerpieces and she pulled it off seamlessly. The cake, THE CAKE, this thing left all my guests stunned. It was so gorgeous! I gave them a picture that I really liked and they elevated it to an entirely different level. It was covered in similar florals from my bouquet. Lets put it this way, I found someone to turn it into an ornament. I needed that beauty immortalized. My guests all raved about the food(one even got back to New Mexico and made sweet potato casserole for himself). Late in the game, I realized there had been a miscommunication about the dinnerware. Emily stepped up to coordinate with a rental facility to ensure that I had the glassware and dinnerware I wanted on my big day. We brought a lot of extra decorations and a S'mores bar. They made sure to meet up with us twice before the wedding to ensure everything was right. It was a great experience and I didn't even mention how beautiful the venue is on it's own!

The Farm at Cedar Springs will amaze you. This all-in-one unique venue is the perfect destination for local and out-of-town brides. The grounds are spectacular and so serene. Absolutely beautiful setup for an indoor/outdoor wedding with lots of space for guests, dancing and fun activities. We were amazed and the team at The Farm at Cedar Springs was truly wonderful to work with. They were extremely helpful, professional and kind! We highly recommend this venue!

From the first day I toured Belle Meade, I fell in love! The venue itself is so gorgeous--my husband and I (and the guests!) loved how much character it had, and moving around throughout the day gives you such a unique experience. Bringing in your own vendors with such a beautiful venue makes it so easy to create whatever you envision for your wedding day. Hannah was so kind, helpful, and responsive throughout the whole wedding planning process. We also loved that it had such a quiet and peaceful feel without being too far from the city! We would choose this venue again and again!!!

My dream wedding was to be a Disney princess! So looking for venues in East Tennessee I was limited on venues that were not barns or industrial. When I found Castleton Farms I just knew I had found the one. From the grounds to the event staff, everything was perfect! Danyelle at Castleton took care of me through the whole process. I booked 2 years in advance because of my anxiety brain. Danyelle kept me in check the whole time, ensured me I was ahead of schedule, and that I was right where I needed to be. She also went to bat for me with all my vendors; I hardly had to do a thing. When it came to the big day, I did not want to set anything or worry about a thing. Being an event planner, that was every important to me. I set up events on a daily basis, so I definitely did not want to on my wedding day! The wedding day could not have been smoother or more perfect. Danyelle and Kendahl were great the whole day! Kendahl made sure I had everything I needed before I knew I needed it. She even carried about my 8 pound bouquet! I can not say enough great things about the team and the stunning venue! If you want a beautiful, relaxing, stressful day Castleton Farms should be your top choice!

Absolutely beautiful venue. Magnificent backdrops and great amenities. The Barn was perfect for a magical ceremony and reception and they made sure that we did not have any questions or concerns before the ceremony. It was great having access to the house the night before the ceremony and the game room was perfect for the groomsmen to get ready. The bridal suite was very well set up for all of the bridesmaids to get ready. They helped with set up in the perfect way and overall took a lot of stress out of the weekend. Shawn was very quick to respond when things inevitably went wrong on the wedding day and made sure we had access to a lot of things that we needed.

This venue is beautiful, and we loved working with their family towards my daughter's wedding. They were available for meetings throughout the planning, full of ideas for us, and have many options for weddings. Now that my daughter's wedding is over, I miss working with them. They can provide most wedding services, as few or as many as you want them to do. Everything they did, was perfect!
