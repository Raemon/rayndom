Hannah was a pleasure to work with through the planning process. We were able to select non-traditional songs from a vast selection of pop and oldies songs in their repertoire (Beatles, Stevie Wonder, etc). If we wanted, they would’ve learned new songs for a very low price. They were professional and right on cue. Our guests loved the little surprises we had for them when they were likely expecting classical music (which, no doubt, would’ve been beautiful as well!) Thank you Hannah!!!

Joe was the best pianist and so easy to work with!! He played a variety of requests of different genres for our ceremony and reception. He was so willing to do whatever we wanted and was really accommodating to our wedding vision. A fellow pianist (wedding guest) was so impressed with Joe that he videotaped him all night. I would 1000% work with Joe again. 10/10

Trio was great. Zorica Dimova was a pleasure to work with. She made great recommendations for music. It was lovely. Better than I expected.

As a classical musician getting married to a blues musician, the music at our wedding was very important. We spent long hours listening, debating, and downright arguing over who and what we wanted. We eventually stumbled across Dr. Jazz. And thank goodness we did! I called Russell and told him what we were looking for and he made it happen. We even had a little mixup because of the strings I wanted and he had to get with some musicians they have never worked with before on the day of and play music together, and they did it perfectly. Then- to put the icing on the cake- still second lined for us in the rain down 3rd street in Baton Rouge!! We managed to stay dry under most of the business signs and overhangs, but it was still unexpected since the weather had taken a turn. They then kept our cocktail hour classic and fun by playing jazz standards and songs that we had chosen, and then some! While I am so very disappointed I didn’t get to fully enjoy the cocktail hour listening to them, my guests filled me in as they were so terribly impressed! Even the musicians in the crowd (and there were a lot) were enamored with the crew! I would definitely recommend using Dr. Jazz & the New Orleans Sounds for any event!!!

New Orleans Classical and Jazz provided the music for our ceremony and it was beautiful! Leading up to the event, Harry was so great to work with, he provided helpful suggestions and was very patient with us while we changed our music list multiple times trying to find the perfect set. The musicians that played at the ceremony (one cellist and two violinists) were extremely talented and played every song beautifully. I was so happy I got to listen to them play while we waited for the procession and they really made the ceremony perfect!

We decided not too long before the wedding to have a harpist at the ceremony, and Ashley was available, affordable, professional, and very nice to work with. She has a large repertoire of music already, but was also willing to perform a few extra songs we wanted. Hiring Ashley perform was probably one of the least stressful parts about the wedding! Highly, highly recommended.
