We were so grateful to have Leslie as our daughter's day-of wedding coordinator in May 2024. Her absolutely lovely upbeat personality, careful organization, attention to detail and calm flexibility adapting to issues that naturally arise when planning and implementing a wedding day vision are second to none. We highly recommend Leslie's services for your upcoming wedding or other special event. With her at your side, you can relax and enjoy the moments knowing that all of the behind-the-scenes details will be attended to beautifully.

Melanie is incredibly professional and easy to work with. She made us feel comfortable every step of the way and simplified the wedding planning process. She was attentive to our needs, great at communication, and clearly cared about us having the best experience possible.

Where to begin..My daughter was planning her wedding and she was set on doing it herself. However, after several hiccups along the way and my daughter just about to say forget and elope, we found Mrs. K'Daya at Lavender Event Planning and life was great again. She stepped right in with everything we had already done and took over from there. She answered the phone when my daughter called, she handled every issue that arose and made sure my daughter could focus on being a bride and actually enjoying the process. The big day K'Daya made sure everything (and I mean everything) was setup, timelines were met and everyone was where they were supposed to be at the right time. The way she catered to my daughter and her needs with everything else she was doing was so special to me. She is definitely great at what she does and is so sweet while she is getting it done! I would recommend her to anyone!

Complete Weddings did an amazing job. Shay went above and beyond all wedding day like she did with the engagement pictures. She is flexible and organized. She is so personable and great with our two young kids. She even jumped in to help get the kids’ wedding shoes on! Shay made us feel comfortable from the beginning and was open to any questions and photo ideas we had. She was very responsive to our questions and really seemed to understand what we wanted even when we did not always know ourselves! We cannot say enough good things about her! Highly, highly recommend! Griz did a great job! The music for the ceremony was very important to us, and he did just what we asked and did a great job at the ceremony. He is very personable, organized, and detail-oriented. I was confident he would manage everything from the ceremony to the reception well and he did! He was an important and amazing part of our wedding! Lynn was wonderful at the Photo Booth, kind, and patient. We and the wedding guests felt very comfortable with her! We especially appreciate her giving us our Photo Booth album before we left for the evening which enjoyed looking at that night and will keep for years to come! Thanks Lynn!

Sam and Samri were so amazing! They helped us as day of coordinators and I honestly can't imagine not having them there. The day went so smoothly through my eyes and I honestly had no stress throughout the entire day and just got to live in the moment. They did so much for me and my husband; I can't thank them enough. They helped me realize my vision and brought it to life. Thank you so much!

She helped so much in the stressful process of wedding planning by helping us create a not overwhelming to do list, offering suggestions for planning, and helping us manage crises as they arose. She helped our ceremony and reception look beautiful and flow perfectly! I would recommend anyone stressing about wedding planning to use her services!

Taryn was amazing--we couldn't have had our wedding without her. We had a pretty "small" wedding, roughly 60 people in attendance, and a handful of vendors. Still, she treated our wedding line she was planning a Royal wedding! My wedding was the only one I had ever been to, and mine was the first wedding our family had organized since 1986, so we were definitely out of practice. She coordinated with us and all our vendors the month/day of and I didn't have to worry about a thing. I strongly recommend getting a coordinator if you can afford one, and if you do, get Taryn!
