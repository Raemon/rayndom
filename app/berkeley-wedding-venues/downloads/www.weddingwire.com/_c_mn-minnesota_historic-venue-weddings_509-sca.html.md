The Revival was only the second venue we toured and we knew from the moment we stepped foot inside, the search was over. The venue is beautiful and Julie and Scott were so easy to work with. Down to earth people who go above and beyond to make your day unique to you as a couple. Any idea we had, they brought to life and made it even better than we could imagine! The day of coordinator thought of every detail to make the day run smoothly. There wasn’t a single hiccup in our day and I think that was due to the hard work of the staff at the Revival. I would recommend the Revival on Main to any couple looking for a venue!

The Whim is such a beautiful space!! Initially, we were worried that our colorful red and gold-themed wedding would look tacky, but because the space is a blank white canvas, our wedding ended up looking much prettier than I could have ever imagined. We really appreciated that the getting ready spaces were equally gorgeous and spacious for both the groom and bride and there is so much natural light for getting ready. For an all-indoor wedding, the space is spacious and comfortable – the speakeasy came in clutch when a couple of our guests had a couple drinks too many and needed a quiet place to rest. One thing to note for those with more sensitivities to sound is that since this is a warehouse/factory-based venue, like many of the other warehouse venues in the city, the sound can be echoey and loud. Jennae and Elliot were great and I appreciated that I could email them and get a response when needed. I also loved that we were able to customize our signature cocktails by just providing some recipes and Elliot worked to make sure that they got them just right – our guests were raving about the cocktails. I also appreciated that they gave us the extra Yakult yogurt drinks they had purchased for our signature drinks at the end of the night, after our guests had ended up finishing the straight soju alone. It’s clear that The Whim has been very thoughtfully designed for events and the venue coordinators, Michelle and Courtney (I believe) were super helpful and easy to work with. Overall, we would recommend The Whim for anyone who wants a light and airy space and who wants a colorful wedding to pop!

Absolutely amazing venue. They have many beautiful options for both the ceremony and reception. Their teams works close with you through the whole process. Stacey was amazing in communication with me. She was quick to respond to any emails I had. Would definitely recommend this venue to others and if I ever have another big event, would definitely book with them again.

They were so easy to work with along the planning journey and on the day of they were so friendly and excited for me and my husband. I had last minute changes and they were so accommodating . They do have an exclusive caterer which scared me at first but they were just amazing as the venue staff.

We celebrated a milestone birthday here and enjoyed the food, setup, and cooperation of the servers and Event planner Georgene. I would use this again as the historic site was nice and food excellent!

Overall, we had a great time working with the Campus Club as our wedding venue. The venue itself was great, day-of went very smoothly and everyone had great compliments about the venue as a whole. The only hiccup we had was with setting up our decorations. It was slightly a bummer to no be able to get into the venue on the day until 1 pm, so you either need a wedding coordinator or amazing friends and family (like me) that will help out quickly before the ceremony. Other than that, everyone was amazing to work with and they were always very responsive to our questions!

Buckle up, this is going to be the five-est five-star review of all time. I can’t possibly say enough good things about my wedding at Hall of Kings. For the rental price, I think it’s pretty much impossible to find a better wedding experience in Minneapolis. Let’s start with the basics. It’s a beautiful space that requires very little additional décor to make it feel incredibly special. We had 109 guests and it was just about the perfect size for that group (I wouldn’t recommend it for more than about 120). Sam, the venue coordinator we worked with was very responsive and helpful. Everyone we ever spoke to was very relaxed and flexible we never felt pressured to make certain decisions. Based on other reviews, we were very excited about the food and it didn’t disappoint. Hands down the best wedding meal I’ve ever had. Everyone loved the specialty drinks too! The price is incredibly reasonable for what they offer. It’s a one-stop shop in terms of the bar and catering, so you don’t have to wrangle outside bartenders or catering services. You need to arrange your own décor setup if you bring in your own, but that’s standard across most wedding venues, and HOK provides votive candles as well as all tables, chairs, and tableware and they set up everything they own themselves. The Hepburn suite was also gorgeous!! If you’re thinking about bringing your own music to your wedding and skipping the DJ, this is the spot for you. They have a great sound system with microphones all ready to go and a soundproofed stage for the dance floor. All we had to do was plug my phone into an aux cord and people literally danced all night. The dancefloor also has alternating colored lighting that makes it feel like a party! Beyond that, the staff went out of their way to make everything easy and fun for us. The venue coordinator we’d been working with transferred to a different venue a month before our wedding, and I was very worried about being assigned someone new. But our day-of coordinator Shane was the MVP of the day!! He let us move our cocktail hour indoors into the empty venue next door when it looked like it would be too cold to host it outdoors. He made setup incredibly smooth for my vendors. He arranged to have sparkling wine and a cooler of water brought to the bridal suite as soon as my bridesmaids and I arrived. He was unobtrusive during the cocktail hour and reception while still helping me make announcements and set up the music. We hadn’t arranged table drink service, but servers made sure that we at the head table had everything we needed all night. Seriously just incredible, incredible service way beyond what I could have imagined!! These people genuinely care about making your day the best it can possibly be, and I know for a fact that that isn’t the case at every venue. I can’t recommend Hall of Kings highly enough. Deserves 10 stars!! Thank you for the best day of my life!!

My husband and I got married on June 21st, 2025 at Little Log House and we couldn't have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding! From the moment we first visited, we fell in love with the all around character and beautiful spaces at the venue, and we immediately knew it was the one. The team at the venue exceeded every single expectation right from the beginning and continued to do so all the way through to our special day! Both the ceremony and reception spaces are absolutely stunning and the entire venue has so much character and uniqueness all around! What sets this venue apart even more so is the incredible team that we worked with from the beginning stages of planning all the way to our wedding day. They were professional, organized, and genuinely invested in making our day perfect. Every question we had was answered quickly and kindly, and on the wedding day, everything ran so smoothly thanks to their behind-the-scenes coordination with us! Our guests are still talking to us about how cool the venue was and how smooth everything felt. We knew we were in good hands, and it allowed us to be fully present and enjoy every moment of our special day. Thank you to everyone at Little Log House for helping us create the most magical day of our lives. Our Happily Ever After was beyond perfect. If you're considering this venue — I would highly recommend them! You will not be disappointed!

Union Depot saved our wedding day! When April flooding along the Mississippi River closed our planned dream venue of Harriet Island Pavilion, the staff there graciously pointed us in the direction of Union Depot. We made a call to Dawn and met with her, Grace, and Cassie - and with their help were able to reconfigure our wedding in less than a month! We opted to have all of our wedding events - ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception - in the Waiting Room at Union Depot (which not only simplified the planning process and made it easier for our guests to go from one event to the next but also helped us stay within our budget.) Even though our total guest count was on the smaller side (~ 118), they were able to split the large room into different sections using black curtains so the space never felt empty. The historic building itself, with cream brick, high ceilings, and beautiful architecture, fit perfectly with our plan of minimalistic decor. Our guests had plenty of space both at their tables and on the dance floor, were able to park in nearby lots (and didn't have to pay themselves since we were able to purchase and distribute parking vouchers through the Depot), and didn't have to travel far from hotels in downtown St. Paul (we stayed at Hotel 340 and had a great experience). Union Depot even had a ping pong table we were able to use for the reception, which was a hit! All in all, we had a GREAT experience with Union Depot and are so grateful for all of the help they provided to make our wedding day as amazing as it was. Dawn, Grace, and Cassie were all top-notch in their customer service, promptness, thoroughness, and friendliness. 10/10 recommend this venue for those looking for a Twin Cities venue!

Historic Concord Exchange is a beautiful old building with lots of charm and character, it doesn’t need many decorations which makes a great way to stay in budget. The staff were super polite, helpful and eager to please!
