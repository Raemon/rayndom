I ordered 5 pairs of these unqiue handmade wooden cufflinks from this vendor for my groomsmen and myself and they all looked great! They were reletively cheap compared to cufflinks you can usually buy in the store and since I order so many, they gave me free shipping. Look great with brown accessories and there were many types of woods to choose from, so I ordered 5 different types of woods so they all looked unique.

What's Popp'N provided me with the popcorn bar for my wedding reception & it was a huge hit!!! I never knew such a thing existed until my wedding planner suggested What's Popp'N. My husband and I both LOVE popcorn so this was the perfect thing to have at our wedding! They have an unbelievable amount of flavors to choose from. We finally decided on caramel chocolate drizzle, cinnamon & sugar, buttered, white cheddar, and GRAPE!!! (Wisteria was our primary wedding color so What's Popp'N suggested the grape flavor and it was out of this world delicious!) They set up the popcorn bar and it looked elegant & fun at the same time. I decided to buy vintage looking popcorn bags so everyone could take home the popcorn as a wedding favor. All of my guests loved this idea! What's Popp'N provides a very generous amount of popcorn for the price. We went through a ton of popcorn yet managed to have plenty to take home and enjoy for ourselves! :o) I was thrilled with our decision to hire What's Popp'N for our wedding. If you do the same, you will not be disappointed!

The Write Gal was awesome!! She lettered on cigar boxes for my daughters Bridesmaid gifts and they were beautiful!! Worked with us on the perfect font and even made sure everything would work on the type of wood. Will definitely use The Write Gal for future wedding items!!!
