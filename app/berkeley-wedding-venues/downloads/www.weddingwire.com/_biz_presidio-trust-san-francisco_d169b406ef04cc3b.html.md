The Presidio is a wedding venue located in San Francisco, California. First fortified by Spain in 1776, this site has long played a key role in the defense of San Francisco Bay. In 1846, the fort and surrounding land passed into the possession of the United States Army. Today, the area is a national park site. The park is a place of extraordinary natural beauty, where woodlands give way to breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge.

**Facilities and Capacity**

The Presidio boasts a number of beautiful event facilities. The Chapel of Our Lady was the site’s first established place of worship. Built in 1846, it features lovely stained glass windows and a lovely arched ceiling. A large cathedral window bathes the chancel in natural light. The Presidio Chapel was built in 1931. Designed in the Mission Revival style, the Chapel’s tall walls are capped with a handsome redwood ceiling. The floor is covered in colored tiles, and one wall of the Chapel is decorated with a splendid fresco. The nearby memorial garden is a favorite spot for outdoor ceremonies. A short distance beyond this, the Presidio Officers’ Club invites couples and their guests to enjoy its elegant Ortega Ballroom and gorgeous views of San Francisco Bay. Located on the second floor of the building, the Ortega Ballroom is able to accommodate 220 banqueting guests. The Golden Gate Club is another popular reception facility. Built in 1949, this spacious building includes a number of event rooms and affords wonderful views of Alcatraz and the park’s forest.

**Services Offered**

The Presidio is equipped for all your ceremony and reception needs. Choose from a range of event rentals. Fill your reception space with lovely banquet tables and mahogany chairs. Add specialty lighting and audio-visual equipment to give the venue a look and sound that is all your own. Overnight accommodation is available at the Inn at the Presidio, and the venue is delighted to offer catering as part of its complete wedding experience. Enjoy delicious selections from the award-winning kitchens of Traci Des Jardins. Treat your guests to carne asada tostadas, chickpea galette, and more.

Flawless Planning and Day!

We hosted our wedding at the Presidio Officers' Club and had truly the most special, incredible day of our lives. It was clean, well-organized, with delicious food and friendly staff.   
  
Not to mention, the planning team at the Presidio, through Wedgewood Weddings, was truly best-in-class. Wedgewood prepared us so well, providing a planning binder and step-by-step instructions. They checked in with us multiple times: providing walk-throughs, and answering every question extremely promptly.   
  
We especially loved our planner and day-of coordinator, Christian, who went out of his way to make everything so seamless. Christian taught us how to do our ceremony, including little details such as hand placement, went out of his way to accommodate a creative painting engagement, and provided private time for us newlyweds. He was perfect!   
  
So grateful to this beautiful venue and our wonderful team. We will treasure our experience with Wedgewood forever.

Officer's club has been one of our favorite venues to work at over the years! We are a video team and do weddings here all the time. The grounds are always well kept and staff is always helpful and friendly. Highly recommend!

Beautiful reception—the perfect night!

We had our reception at Wedgewood, and it was such an amazing experience. The team was incredible throughout our planning process, and we couldn’t believe how easy they made everything. We were so glad to be able to plan everything through them—it made throwing our celebration so much more fun. The reception was beautiful and a total blast. If you’re looking for the right team for your wedding, you’ve found it.

We love our venue, it could be a bit expensive on Saturday event but if you could do it on Friday or [ for us ] on Sunday. The rate is still pretty good. The building gives you the feeling elegant yet very relax at the same time. The view around the building is just wonderful.

Stunning and well-run wedding venue

The Golden Gate Club was the perfect wedding venue. Our guests absolutely loved the beautiful views of the Golden Gate Bridge from the Ventana Room – and we loved how we could get the feel of an outside wedding (tons of windows throughout the building with views of eucalyptus trees), but be comfortably warm inside. It was really easy for our guests to get to the GGC from across SF and the Bay Area, and having our ceremony, cocktail hour and reception all at the same place made everything so convenient. The Presidio is a part of SF that not everyone visits, so both our local and out-of-town guests enjoyed the location. We hired a full band, and the actual stage and dedicated dance floor in the reception room meant everyone could see the band and have plenty of room to dance. Beyond how beautiful and convenient the venue is, the staff at Golden Gate Club and Presidio Catering are experts in running events there and helped our big day go smoothly (thanks Mara and Una!). They know what will work in their space and even have some reasonably-priced tables and chairs to rent. Presidio Catering was the caterer for our event – and everything they made was so delicious (locally-sourced filet mignon, amazing crab cakes, beautiful desserts). The Golden Gate Club is also their home catering kitchen, so everything ran smoothly. They have a large selection of food options, so we didn’t feel limited at all. Overall, if you’re looking for a venue to wow your guests (beautiful view and amazing food), while having everything go smoothly, we highly recommend the Golden Gate Club.

Once I had seen the Golden Gate Club, I knew that I couldnt have my reception any where else. If you are looking for an ideal San Francisco venue this is it. While it can be very pricy on the weekend we opted to get married on a Friday costing us $2,500. The floor to ceiling windows with a view of the bay is the perfect backdrop. We had our cocktails on the Ventana Balcony and then let our guests into the Ventana Room for dinner. A great venue can take your wedding to the next level. Our guests LOVED the Golden Gate Club.

Great venue for a medium sized wedding. The stain glass is a gorgeous contrast to the exposed wooden beams of the vaulted ceiling. There are also plenty of parking.   
  
Only issue is that it does not have wheelchair access.

We had our wedding ceremony and reception here in summer 2011. We looked at many of the Presidio venues as we wanted to keep our wedding in San Francisco and didn’t want to do a hotel. We liked the GGC because it’s an open slate where you’re allowed to make your own choices. You bring in everything from the rentals to your caterer to your own beverages. The initial cost of the GGC is pricey, but if you take into account the amount that you can save by picking and choosing your food and beverages; you can actually save money here. We also liked the timeframe of 2pm-12am. Everyone must leave before midnight so your party needs to end 10:45ish.   
We had 135 guests. We had the ceremony in one of the side rooms, which was perfect. Cocktail hour in the courtyard and the weather agreed with us that evening. Reception in the main room and everyone fit with plenty of room to spare. Buffet setup was in the back of the main room with the bar in the lobby area. I think a guest count of 150 would be excellent, at times our guests seemed spread out.  
You should know that the GGC staff is there to rent you the space and not be your event planner. They will answer your questions on what is allowed and isn’t, but the ideas must come from you, your caterer and wedding planner. They do make this clear to you also.  
Another negative is getting your non-driving guests out of the Presidio. It is very hard to get cabs to come here, almost impossible at 11pm on a Saturday night. We heard other people that have used the GGC have arranged for transportation but we opted not to. We piled people in cars and had a couple cabs shuttle people to just outside the Presidio gates and back, keeping their meter running.

The Golden Gate Club at the Presidio is a GORGEOUS venue with a view that is hard to beat in SF. It is a government property and has it regulations, but is otherwise flexible to suit your needs.

The Presidio Golden Gate Club was a beautiful venue for our wedding. It definitely does have a lot of regulations, but that's expected as it is a government building (hence my flexibility rating). The site has great value, as there are not a lot of places in SF that can offer that much space, fit that many people, and have views of the GG bridge that don't end up costing you an arm & a leg. All in all - an absolute amazing venue with many awesome photo op spots in the surrounding Presidio area. However, I did have 1 issue with their reservation method. The venue used to not allow booking of the venue prior to 1 year out, and my husband & I had visited the site many times throughout the summer of 2012 to relay our interest for late September/early October dates of 2013. We waited patiently for the 1 year out date to compete via fax for our wedding date. However, one weekend in August we decided to once again remind the venue via email of our interest and found out that "management" had changed the rules over the weekend so that the venue could be booked up to 2 years in advance. Apparently 3 of our top wedding dates had been reserved over that weekend when the rules were changed. Luckily, we had "checked in" with them and they ended up holding a later date in October for us for 24 hours (since they felt bad) so that we could get our application in. It ended up being fine (however I will say later October was colder and early October was better weather- grrr). Anyhow, it shouldn't be a problem any longer now that they allow you to book 2 years in advance, but I just need to vent how unprofessional it was for them to "change the rules" over a weekend (when their office is not even open) when they happened to be showing the site to people who of course booked the best weather weekends right away! Just a little frustrating, but after that, our experience was just fine and the venue was great for our wedding.
