The most magical wedding venue!!!

We had our wedding in late February 2022 and are so happy to have found and booked Calamigos Ranch in Malibu!   
  
Throughout the property you will find so many little things that will delight you and your guests. The attention to small details set Calamigos Ranch apart from other venues, the lights in the trees, the various nooks and sitting areas, the sound of relaxing water from creeks and fountains you hear almost everywhere, it all adds up to an unforgettable and amazing ambience.  
  
The food that Calamigos Ranch offers for weddings is outstanding, truly high end with ingredients, preparation, presentation and of course taste. My husband and I have been trying sea bass everywhere since we had it as one of our main meals at our wedding and still can’t beat the one we had at Calamigos.  
  
The way they do “room blocks” is a bit odd compared to what we are used to seeing (prebooked/paid vs. min. commit) … but we found the team to be very accommodating, helpful, and flexible when it came time to finalize all of the room arrangements.  
  
We stayed on property a few days before and after the wedding, which gave us the opportunity to relax and really enjoy it as both a resort and wedding venue. The staff and particularly the team at the Ranch restaurant on property made it a very special week for us. Special thank you to Helen as our coordinator, bartenders Chris and Barbara, and restaurant manager Tyler! You all made our wedding unforgettable for us and our guests! The venue's beautiful water features and unique elements such as the carousel and ferris wheel helped us capture some amazing wedding photos. Highly recommend the Oak Room at Calamigos and also highly recommend booking the Estate Suites for your wedding night as the suite is absolutely gorgeous and huge! The venue was the perfect size for our 75 guests but can definitely fit way more if needed.

Shayne is always a great!

I am a local planner and I just wanted to recommend working with Shayne. The past couple weddings Shayne has gone above and beyond. Here responsiveness and customer service are incomparable. After covid it has been hard to get many venues to respond in a timely manner. Shayne has been a life saver.   
I am grateful to have players like this on my team during an event.

The dreamiest venue ever

THE DREAMIEST VENUE EVER. We were a “covid couple”…. originally supposed to be married in Oct 2020 but had to postpone to Sept 2021 and throughout the entire postponement process, Calamigos was so understanding and accommodating. I could not say enough good things at Calamigos – from the BEAUTIFUL property to the amazing food to the planning team to all in between – everything was best-in-class. Highly, highly recommend!!!!!

Bridesmaid and wedding guest

I can't even begin to describe what an amazing venue Calamigos was for a recent wedding I was in. The level of service was like nothing I have ever experienced! Amazing bartenders who remembered your name and drink night after night, servers with the utmost attention to detail - not to mention the delicious food and drink at the Malibu Cafe and the Ranch Club. The atmosphere is romantic, relaxing and it all comes with a personal touch. Candles with your names on them in the beautiful rooms along with complimentary wine and snacks in room - its like they thought of everything to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. 10 out of 10 would recommend and we can't wait to go back!!

Calamigos Ranch is a real life Shangri-La

Calamigos Ranch exemplifies the term, Shangri-La. As we pulled into the Ranch we were greeted with professionalism and class from the valet attendants to the reception desk. Not to mention, a crisp glass of champagne while we checked in.   
  
We stayed at the Ranch for three nights for a wedding and enjoyed every minute of our time there. Our Villa was spectacular- spacious, clean and comfortable. The outdoor shower was probably my favorite part of the Villa, however, the cozy/clean bed and strong air conditioning tie for a close second.   
  
The pool area and grounds of the entire ranch are pristine- you can tell they take pride in keeping the space well kept. Aside from the beautiful landscape and amenities that Calamigos has to offer, the staff was also top notch. Very attentive and friendly, especially the bartenders! We started our mornings at the Ranch Club (my boyfriend swears by the breakfast burrito and their iced coffee) and spent most of the day relaxing poolside with cocktails and food brought right to our chaise lounge.   
  
The last night of our stay was the Wedding and it was truly out of story book. Beautiful scenery for the ceremony, and the reception cocktail hour to dinner/dancing was nothing short of perfection.   
  
Would HIGHLY recommend Calamigos Ranch to anyone looking for a Wedding venue or retreat type vacation. Thank you Calamigos and hope to be back someday!

Every bit of a 5 star resort!

Calamigos was so much more than we expected. The staff was very professional and accommodating. All of our bags were brought to our room upon check in and we were texted daily asking what time we would like our room to be tidied and if we needed anything. Each event of the wedding weekend was absolutely amazing, no detail was missed. The bartenders at the pool were even kind enough to create a signature cocktail of the for the bride and groom the day after the wedding. This was a terrific wedding venue that I know everyone enjoyed!

Texas sized venue in California!

We attended my nephew's wedding in June. Immediately, when we arrived we were greeted by the valets. Our valet, Asher was beyond helpful, kind and courteous. We shared our bungalow with our two grown sons, who had to leave their wives and children behind in Texas. Our bedrooms were connected by a large bathroom stocked with everything one might leave behind. Our bungalow had a private porch with a bathtub, table and chairs, fountain and an additional seating area. We loved it! We asked for someone from maintenance to come out and check the A/C. Immediately, it was serviced and we were more than comfortable for our entire stay. It had been a long travel day for all of us. We were hungry and ate at the Ranch. We chose to eat outside on their manicured lawn, with twinkling lights above us. It was calming, and picture perfect. The waiter was attentive and answered all of our questions. Our sons each requested a different cut of steak.(We like our steaks in Texas!) To their surprise, the steaks were cooked to perfection! Additionally, we managed to find time to venture out to the beach. It was a 10 minute drive. We were greeted by a happy, female attendant, who escorted the five of us through a tunnel. At the end of the tunnel was a lovely beach and the beautiful ocean! Awaiting for us were five beach lounging chairs with a towel draped on each one. Nicco, the beach attendant was waiting for us. Upon request, he brought out two paddle boards. Our son and another wedding guest spent an hour paddle boarding along side dolphins!  
We attended two events and the wedding at this venue. We were very impressed with the staff and Calamigos. It was truly a memorable stay for us!
