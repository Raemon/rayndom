## About

I just had my wedding at Scott's and I was blown away! The ballroom was just beautiful, it was everything I imagined and more. I can't wait to see the pictures! The staff was amazing - from the planning, to the ceremony, throughout the nite. After our ceremony, we were escorted by out Catering Manager to a private room where appetizers and champagne were waiting for the bridal party. Nice touch! The food was fabulous and we danced, danced, danced all nite. After the wedding, our server presented us with a thank you gift. Can you imagine? This place is top notch, and I'm so happy that I chose Scott's

My wedding dinner was at Scott's. The setup was wonderful. My wedding party arrived earlier than expected and we were seated comfortably in the lounge area. It was wonderful to rest my feet for a moment before the dinner started. The staff and setting was wonderful. There was a pianist that evening who took request. My groom and I danced to "When I Fall in Love." The evening was truly wonderful.

Like I said in my review for our vendor; the food was amazing! They served each plate as it came off the stove! Terrific food service too! We have friends who attended our wedding who returned to Scott's to try more of their food!

Everything went so perfect!! All the hard work paid off.. so thank you with helping, it all turn out so great! From start to finish, the service was superb!! Everything Scott's Garden said they could do and would do was exactly what we received, plus more! If you're looking for stress free wedding service.. you will get stress-free :)   
  
Oh, and I cannot forget to share the fact that Scott's Garden was a last minute replacement after our original ceremony/reception site filed bankruptcy. We were so glad we chose Scott's as our replacement.  
  
Thank you Kasey Howe and Marianne Marko, you both were awesome women to work with!! Very nice and just so easy to work with and talk to. We were very pleased to have been matched up with you. Hats off to the entire staff who work the night of our wedding.. you all were more than awesome!! So accommodating and pleasant.  
  
All the Scott's staff members we met along the way are definitely professional and responsive. I would absolutely recommend Scott's to anyone.  
  
Thanks a million to help make our special night even more special.  
  
Take care,  
Danielle and Casey Roche

We had our ceremony and reception here on 09/19/09. Everything was wonderful! Angelina (our coordinator) was great, helpful from start to finish. The dinner was even better than the sample meal we had tried! All of our guests were impressed with the venue. We couldn't be more pleased!

We really liked Scott's! Our contact person was Corey Jelliffe. She was amazing. We had another venue initially. They went out of business, taking our deposit with them. We contacted Scott's, desperate, and they stepped up immediatly. We had a tasting, the same as the others - chicken & salmon, as well as the mushroom raviolli. I didnt try the salmon, but the other two were great. Corey was quick to return emails and phone calls, even coming in on her day of to make sure our set-up went smoothly. They arranged child meals and gluten free meals for some of our guests even. The only downsides were that it was quite warm, despite repeated request to turn up the air conditioning, and the food service was a little slow. But overall, a wonderful experience, highly recommended.

Scott's Garden was a last minute replacement, after my original site filed bankrupcy three months before my wedding. I contacted Scott's Garden and made an appointment; when I saw the site I knew it was the place for me. It turned out they had my wedding date open for the morning. At first I was disappointed that I wouldn't have the evening wedding I had wanted, but it turned out to be the best day. Marianne and the other catering staff were excellent, she even had the making for my favorite drink (Mojitos) available. My family and friends are still talking about the site and especially the food. The staff pampered me and my husband the entire time we were there. I think I floated through the day. I highly recommend Scott's Garden for anybody who is looking for an outdoor wedding & reception site, and want quality food & beverages.

We had our beautiful wedding and reception at Scott's Garden in Walnut Creek. Adrienne Hettrich and the staff at Scott's were professional, and very on top of our event. Adrienne was quick to respond to emails and phone calls, and in her absence, anyone in the catering office was more than happy to assist us. The site for our wedding was beautiful and the food and service for our reception were wonderful!

Adrianna Castaneda and the staff at Scott's were very helpful and responsive in the entire wedding process. Shanna and I planned our ceremony at Skyline Community Church, but opted to hold our reception at Scott's. Adrianna answered any and all questions and made herself available to meet with us a few times to go over all of the details and double check everything. The reception went so smooth and we could not be happier. All of our guests enjoyed the food, music, venue, and service. If you are looking to hold a special event down the road, then I highly recommend giving Scott's Seafood a call. Shanna and I were very happy and will definitely be using them again to plan a future event. Thank you Scott's and thank you again Adrianna for all of your help!
