Most Beautiful Invitations 

I can’t say enough wonderful things about my experience with this wedding invitation company! The quality of the invitations was absolutely beautiful—elegant, detailed, and even better than I imagined. Linda was such a joy to work with; she made the entire process stress-free with her kindness, patience, and excellent communication. She truly listened to what I wanted and brought it to life perfectly. I felt cared for every step of the way, and it meant so much during such an important time. I would recommend them to any couple looking for invitations that are not only stunning but created with genuine care.

Wonderful service

We had a wonderful experience working with Linda for our wedding invitations. From the very beginning, she was incredibly helpful, responsive, and attentive to every detail. She was always available to answer our questions, offer guidance, and ensure that everything was exactly how we envisioned it.  
  
Her selection was impressive, there were so many beautiful options to choose from, and she helped us find the perfect design that truly reflected us as a couple. The final product came out absolutely stunning, and we couldn’t be happier.  
  
If you’re looking for someone who is knowledgeable, patient, and dedicated to making your wedding feel special from the start, I highly recommend working with her!

Wonderful experience! 10/10 recommend

Linda with lasting impressions was absolutely fantastic to work with. She has so many styles and types of stationary to look through, and gives you the time you need to make sure what you want is perfect. She offers so many suggestions and help during the process, as it can be overwhelming, but Linda was fantastic in providing help and making sure your choice is exactly what you want. The stationary we picked for our wedding was stunning. The quality was unreal, the look of it was exactly what I wanted and I’m still so in love with them! We still receive compliments on our invites. Everything came in so fast too - I didn’t have to worry about timing, because Linda kept me updated through the whole process, and she was so fast getting us our invitation suites. I would absolutely recommend you work with Linda with Lasting Impressions if you want a positive and easy experience.
