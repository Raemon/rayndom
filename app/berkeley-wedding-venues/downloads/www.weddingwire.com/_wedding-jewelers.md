## Selecting Exquisite Wedding Jewelry

Whoever first said that diamonds are a girl’s best friend certainly knew what she was talking about! After all, everyone’s well aware that when it comes to traditional wedding jewelry, those beautiful, shiny little rocks have always taken center stage. Although wedding rings typically get the most attention of all jewelry accessories, wedding jewelry extends far beyond just your fingers. In fact, the right jewelry pieces will enhance your entire look — head-to-toe — and even draw your guests’ attention to your finest features.

From classic pearl necklaces and layered bracelets to sparkling earrings and gem-laden pendants, we've got you covered with tips for selecting all of your wedding jewelry and accessories. Whether you prefer small, dainty charms or bold, statement pieces, finding the right wedding jewelry and accessories is an important part of completing your individualized look for one of the most memorable days of your life. Here’s how to find the perfect glitz to enhance the glamour of your wedding gown, without losing your sense of style along the way.

## The Right Type (and Quantity) of Wedding Jewelry

While the actual amount of wedding jewelry you decide to wear is ultimately a personal preference, experts typically lean toward the idea that ‘less is more’. They advise that you not overdo things by wearing large pieces that would take away from your beauty — or that of your fabulous ring! When choosing your jewelry, it's often recommended that you use it as a way to guide the eyes of your guests towards whichever features you’d most like to highlight. Most importantly, make sure your selections complement your gown since that is the focal point of your wedding look and style.

It is generally a good idea to coordinate your wedding jewelry tones with your wedding gown’s hue. For instance, gold jewelry goes well with ivory, cream or champagne-colored dresses, while platinum or silver look fantastic with bright white fabrics. If you’re wearing blush tones, you can even consider rose gold jewelry.

You’ll also want to coordinate jewelry options with your wedding gown’s neckline; here are several suggestions for pairing jewelry with various gown types. For a higher, bateau neckline, consider opting for a romantic pair of teardrop earrings — along with an up-do — instead of wearing a necklace. If you’ve chosen a v-neck gown, you’ll be happy to hear this style is a very versatile option for wedding jewelry and can be worn with or without a necklace, and with long or short earrings. If your gown is strapless, you can either wear a statement necklace or go with a simple, classic strand of pearls. Although it's generally easiest to incorporate a wider range of wedding jewelry with either strapless or sweetheart style necklines, that doesn't mean there aren't hundreds of other combinations to work with all types of wedding dresses.

If you’re wearing a veil, consider whether your jewelry works well with both the veil and your hairpiece. Remember that your hair can be accessorized with jewelry, too! You might also think about wearing additional wedding jewelry other than just earrings, necklaces, and bracelets. Of course, the most important thing is that you feel radiantly beautiful wearing whatever pieces you choose. Find accessories that you feel great about and be sure to let your personal style shine through.

Don’t forget about the rest of your wedding party, too! Gifting your bridesmaids with coordinating necklaces (or another piece of gorgeous wedding jewelry) creates a lovely, cohesive look and also gives your closest friends and family members something special to remember the day by.

## Finding a Wedding Jewelry Store

A wedding jewelry store will have knowledgeable experts who can help brides find the perfect pieces to match her style, gown, theme, and budget.
