Beautiful arrangement and great to work with

I have never been the type who understood flowers. I knew they were pretty, but I never truly knew what I loved and what I didn't. In comes Shelley with her beautiful and creative mind. I told her my theme was purple and grey with a little fairy tale, whimsical type feel to it. I knew I wanted my bouquet to be just a little bit bigger than my bridesmaids. It was so early in the planning phase that I wasn't fully sure exactly what structures would be available for the actual arrangement, but I gave her a picture of what the vision one (an arch with flowers on it).  
  
During the planning phase, I ran into some hiccups when determining what frames/arches to use during the ceremony. After many, many emails with Shelley (which, thank you so much for your patience, as I know exactly how hard it is to work with someone who doesn't even know what they want), I finally settled on a gold arch with the flowers decorating the bottom and a drape in the middle, and I was in LOVE.   
  
Shelley also helped so much in terms of the logistic,s like reusing bridesmaid bouquets for centerpieces at the reception, reusing the flower arch decor for the sweetheart table, adding greenery to the dessert and appetizer tables, to welcome tables, etc.   
  
Overall, a wonderful person to work with, with lots of patience and a beautifully creative mind.

Hire her!

I was literally awestruck when I saw my ceremony arbor, sweetheart table, and fireplace mantel on my wedding day. Shelley brought my entire floral vision to life in the most beautiful way, it truly took my breath away.  
  
Going into wedding planning, I knew nothing about flowers, and Shelley made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. She sent photo examples to help me narrow down what I liked and didn’t like, let me share my Pinterest board, and really took the time to understand my style. The mums and white roses she chose were absolutely stunning and fit the fall season perfectly.  
  
On top of being incredibly talented, Shelley was punctual, kind, and always available, whether by email or text, anytime I had a question. Her responsiveness and attention to detail gave me so much peace of mind throughout planning.  
  
She also came up with thoughtful ideas to repurpose pieces, like moving the arbor florals to our sweetheart table after the ceremony, and designed the most gorgeous mantel setup. Everyone was raving about the flowers from the moment they arrived.  
  
Shelley exceeded every expectation. Her artistry, professionalism, and warmth made the entire experience unforgettable. I couldn’t recommend her more!

Gorgeous Florals!

Shelley was a dream to work with! I had a very limited budget for florals which was below the minimum amount for many other vendors in the area. Shelley was so kind and more than willing to work within the budget allocated. Before booking, she provided an hour long free consultation to understand my vision and budget. I know next to nothing about flowers so I simply told her my colors and favorite flowers and trusted her to use her expertise to find the most cost effective options. And boy did she deliver! The flowers were stunning and so full. We opted to repurpose many of the arrangements such as the bridesmaids' bouquets and the altar decorations which was a great money saver. Delivery was also included which was also not a guarantee with other vendors when working with limited budgets. Shelley was also one of the most communicative vendors that I worked with in the wedding process - typically responding to my questions within a day. Thank you Shelley for making our day so gorgeous!

Top Tier Florist

Shelley is a top tier wedding florist! The arrangements she created were full and beautiful. She had outstanding communication throughout my engagement, and I was confident she understood my vision. I felt very well taken care of with Shelley!  
  
  
  
After the wedding, I sent my bridal bouquet to be preserved and pressed into a float frame. I had noted the technique Shelley used to deliver the flowers to the church on my wedding day and mimicked it when I mailed my bouquet to the preservation company. Despite the transit taking longer than normal due to mailing it over a holiday weekend, the preservation company let me know my bouquet arrived in perfect condition. I credit Shelley for the beautiful, long lasting flowers.

Just amazing

I don’t know where to start. Shelley is truly awesome. She is so kind and so easy to work with. We worked on my vision and she brought it to life. She made the most stunning bouquet and center pieces for my wedding. The flowers were so gorgeous I wish I could have kept them forever. Not to mention how good they smelled! We were so impressed and so were our guests and families. I have to also say her pricing is quite reasonable and she works with you to stick to your budget. She is quick to respond and is so sweet!! Truly amazing and wonderful florist. Recommend her 100%

Shelley is amazing!

Shelley was so wonderful to work with - she helped me decide which colors and flowers to use, worked with me to stay within my budget, and she created beautiful arrangements. She even customized the bridesmaids' bouquets to match their dresses, as there were 3 different colors. I would definitely recommend working with Shelley!

Floral Elegance

Shelly’s Florist gave us first class service throughout our entire event planning process. Unfortunately, our first event we had planned was canceled for personal reasons but Shelly’s Florist showed us the grace and flexibility that other vendors didn’t. We continued to work with Shelly on our next event we had planned and she was patient with us and became the save the day vendor in so many ways. We were able to stay in budget and make our vision a reality with Shelly’s help. Her team went above and beyond coming to our venue in advance to taking measurement to ensure that everything fit just right. Our decorating needed to be original and unique because the space had never been decorated before. The fresh evergreens and pinecones at our event wowed our guest every step of the way. This event was a huge deal for not only our family but our business, as it was a soft opening for Oasis Barn Brewery and Winery. Our guests were so impressed by the décor they were delighted to take the centerpieces home. I highly recommend Shelly’s Florist for any and all events with her design help and beautiful greenery. Shelly’s Florist made our event a success!
