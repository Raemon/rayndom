Fun, flexible space with lots of potential for a unique event that feels custom to you. 

We loved using Space Annex as our venue! The space is open, bright and with moveable walls and multiple levels, can be arranged so many different ways. Plus, the open rooftop patio was such a cool spot for our first dance at sunset. The industrial look of the brick outside, open ceilings, and metal railings was perfect for what we had in mind and our photographers loved everything about it too. I was especially excited about their custom woodtop tables - so beautiful that we didn't feel the need to mess with linens or greenery, or anything fancy/expensive just to cover them, AND included in the price of the venue rental which was very reasonable to begin with. The black chairs were also included and were comfy, blended in well and worked perfectly with the look of the tables. Working with Micky, the very kind manager, was so easy, and she gave us so many great recommendations - we went with both a caterer and a bar service that she recommended and had great experiences with each. I would recommned the Space Annex to anyone looking for a venue with character.

Nice & Unique Venue

Space was a great fit for our needs - unique, versatile and relatively affordable. I loved that we could bring our own food and vendors in and that they offered an outdoor space. They also had a lot of other things included in the rental and it was a fun venue overall!

Great time

First off, we had about 115 people at our wedding (ceremony and reception) at space gallery. The venue was perfect for that size though it could handle more if needed. The art, space, and different outdoor/indoor areas made for a perfect space.   
  
Micky and the other staff were awesome to work with, especially given the challenging circumstances of planning our big day through the pandemic.  
  
If you like the art gallery vibe for your wedding, I can't recommend this place enough. It was also great that they let you bring in whatever vendors you want and buy your own alcohol. We ended up using mountain crust, who are also awesome and synergize perfectly with space gallery.   
  
Honestly, our only wish is that we could plan more events with them.

We can't say enough about how perfect a venue the Space Gallery was for our wedding. Their team was great to work with, professional, and responsive. We mainly worked with Jillian - she was great. She helped us map out things ahead of time, worked so well with our caterer, and just overall provided a great experience beforehand and day of. We had our ceremony on the patio and it felt intimate despite having 150+ guests. The gallery provided the modern, elegant reception area we had hoped for and a great party space! We highly recommend Space Gallery and can't wait to go back for other events in the years to come.

I just got married at the Space Gallery and it was absolutely fantastic. I worked with Michael and Micky. I even hired Micky as the day of wedding coordinator and she was outstanding! Micky went above and beyond the call of duty and kept the whole day running on schedule. Space is open airy and beautiful. I am so thankful they were available for my wedding day!

We looked at quite a few spaces around the Denver area and loved Space Gallery, especially the fact that we could cater whatever we wanted instead of having to pick from an approved vendor list, which was a huge deal for us. The space is beautiful and can definitely be transformed however you want. Since there's art already on the walls, we didn't really need to decorate beyond having center pieces at the tables. We worked with Michael, the owner, and he was super friendly and was always flexible with us dropping by to look at the space with our families and wedding coordinator. He also recommended quite a few of the vendors we ended up hiring for our reception. We also worked with Jillian (the event manager) and she was great about telling us what we could or could not do with the space. The space is equipped with a projector and A/V system, so our DJ was able to easily connect to the speakers, etc. We also loved that there was a semi-covered outdoor space where we had lawn games and cocktail tables. There's a great upstairs area where we had the photo booth. The rental for the space also included all the tables/chairs/bars, etc., so it was really nice not to have to rent from a separate company. Overall would definitely recommend Space Gallery as a wedding reception venue!

Space Gallery was the perfect place for my October wedding! I worked with their event coordinator, Jillian, and even hired her to take on my day of coordinating as well! I cannot say enough about how awesome my experience was working with her! The space itself is beautiful and the owners and staff have always been very helpful and so nice to us. I never felt any pressure to add on extra items(there isn't a ton that's not included in the rental fee) and they let you choose your entire vendor team yourself. Jillian of course made awesome recommendations and I was able to hand select the team I wanted for my day. Which is what made it perfect for us! Thank you again Space Gallery and Jillian for being so awesome and for providing such a breath taking space to get married in!!

Everything About This Experience Was Wonderful! Space Gallery Was The PERFECT Venue For Our Wedding, All Of Our Guests Loved It, We Loved It, And Wouldn't Change A Thing If We Did It All Again! A Big Thanks To Space's Event Team, There Was Always Someone There To Answer Any Questions We Had, Someone There The Day Of The Wedding, And Always Responded Very Quickly To Calls, Texts, And E-Mails. This Place Rocks! :)

We were looking for somewhere that provided great flexibility and was easy for guests. We loved that we could choose our own caterers, florists, music, etc. We had a final count of 80 people and if our full list of 120 had showed it would have been crowded, but we had plenty of room. The staff was good, but a little slow on responses in the planning stage. Overall, very happy to have had our wedding and reception there.
