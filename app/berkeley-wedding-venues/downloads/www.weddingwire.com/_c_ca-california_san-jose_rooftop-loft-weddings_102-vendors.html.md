We hosted our wedding of 100 at SVCC. We worked with Cheryl and she was amazing throughout the whole process. Our budget wasn't extremely high, but Cheryl assured us they would make it work. Not only did she make it work, but it was way less than expected. Not one detail was overlooked. The day of the wedding Cheryl really took charge and made sure everything ran smoothly. The entire staff was extremely professional, helpful, and went above and beyond. We got so many compliments on the venue, food, and staff. Would definitely recommend this venue for any special event.
