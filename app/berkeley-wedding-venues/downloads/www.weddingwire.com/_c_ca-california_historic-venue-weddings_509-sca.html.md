We hosted our October 2023 Wedding Ceremony at Hakone and we were so happy with the beautiful gardens and overall experience. The staff at Hakone (Tony and Melia) were extremely helpful, friendly, and easy to work with and they went above and beyond to make sure our rehearsal and ceremony went smoothly. We requested a unique setup with two aisles and we had a large decoration to attach to an arch we rented through a vendor, and they worked with both us and our vendors to make sure that everything was set up just right with plenty of time to spare. They also helped us work through all the important details of the ceremony without being overwhelming, and they did a perfect job executing on the actual ceremony, queuing our party to walk and managing the music and sound system. The garden itself is beautiful in any season. We visited multiple times throughout the year leading up to our wedding and enjoyed different plants in bloom every time. In October, the garden was still lush and green with redwoods, bamboo, and the Koi pond providing amazing variety. Our guests had a great time strolling through the gardens before and after the ceremony, and there were tons of amazing backdrops for our wedding photos. They even gave us a complimentary year-long membership following our wedding so we could come back to relive the memories! In summary, we highly recommend Hakone whether for a wedding ceremony or just a visit!

If I had do it all over again, I would do it exactly the same! It was a dream come true to have our wedding reception at Fort Mason and I'm so thankful to have had Shawn and the whole team at Fort Mason to assist with our wedding day. The venue is beautiful and all of our guests were stunned by the view and location.

I would recommend Alexandra and her team without hesitation. Our wedding was a deeply cherished moment full of love, beauty and togetherness. Alexandra curated an exceptional day and made us both feel welcome, relaxed and fully present for our wedding. Our friends and family loved the ceremony, the wonderful intimate venue with lush gardens and a spectacular view. The house from 1920’s and is a rare combination of old-Hollywood charm, European elegance and modern sophistication - a dream come true for us both. Milly and I are deeply grateful that we found Alexandra - THANK YOU!

My partner and I serendipitously came across The Ebell online when researching wedding venues in Los Angeles. I am an LA native and I knew for the longest time that I wanted to find a venue back home to celebrate our wedding. We fell in love with the venue through pictures and we scheduled a tour for April of 2023. When we walked into the space for the first time we fell in love with the space even more. The pictures did not properly capture the immense beauty of the venue. After the tour we had to wait a bit to book the venue (since we were booking very far in advance) but throughout that time the entire events team was responsive and coordinated with us throughout next steps. After we booked the venue we were able to schedule subsequent visits to tour the space in order to plan how we wanted to use the venue for our wedding. Food and drink is done in house, and we were lucky to attend one of the food and drink tasting nights. We had so much fun trying out their different signature cocktails, appetizers, and entrees, all of which were very delicious. We were even able to work with the chef to address any dietary restrictions/allergies, as well as create one of the desserts that I loved eating when I was a child. Along with food and drink, there are many ways to customize the space, including linens, in house furniture, and lights. As for the day of the wedding, everything was so beautiful and well executed. Simply being in the space and celebrating our wedding was a dream come true. Everyone loved the professionalism and friendliness of the staff. So many guests came up to us afterward to tell us how impressed they were with dinner service, and the bartenders. Everyone loved the food and drink, including the late night snack trays that were passed around well into the night. We cannot express how thankful we are to the entire team at The Ebell for making this critical part of our wedding planning so easy from start to finish. We are so lucky to have been able to celebrate our wedding at our dream venue.

We cannot recommend Emily and Janciz at City Club enough! They truly were the dream team that made our wedding experience completely stress-free and enjoyable, both during the planning process and on the big day. From our very first consultation, they were incredibly organized, proactive, and responsive. Planning a wedding can be overwhelming, but Emily and Janciz were always ten steps ahead, ensuring every detail was covered well in advance. Their level of professionalism and expertise was immediately apparent. We had to go back and forth on the Banquet Event Order many times because some things we thought would be fun to add (lamb shanks, french fry station, etc.) ended up compounding in price with surcharges and taxes. But, they were very willing to help us with our requests. They made us feel completely supported and heard throughout the entire journey. On the day of the wedding, everything ran flawlessly. They were constantly on top of every detail, allowing us to relax and fully immerse ourselves in the celebration. City Club is a beautiful venue, but Emily and Janciz are the incredible people who truly bring the experience to life. If you are considering City Club, you are in the best hands possible with Janciz!

If you’re searching for a venue that’s stunning and full of timeless elegance, Castle Green is it! From the moment we stepped onto the property, we knew it was the perfect place for our wedding. The venue offers both indoor and outdoor ceremony options, and its natural beauty means you don’t need a lot of extra decoration—it speaks for itself. Tatiana was such a pleasure to work with. She was incredibly helpful and made the planning process feel smooth and stress-free from start to finish. I highly recommend attending one of their open houses to meet their preferred vendors—it really helped us envision our day and make informed decisions. Brides: definitely consider adding the bridal suite. The extra space was so helpful while getting ready, and it made the whole experience even more special. We’re so happy we chose Castle Green—our day was unforgettable!

We enjoyed a fabulous destination wedding at the CIA Greystone in Napa, in May, 2025. We are from the Hudson Valley in New York, where the CIA mother campus is located, and we regularly enjoy dinners prepared by the students/staff in Hyde Park. It was even better in CA! The advance coordination was thoughtful, sensitive and spot-on, the day-of execution was seamless, and the food was beyond beautiful, tasty and exquisitely creative. We only wish we could do it all over again! We highly recommend the CIA Greystone for anyone looking for a memorable and incomparable wedding/event, at a one-in-a-million venue.

We hosted our wedding at the Presidio Officers' Club and had truly the most special, incredible day of our lives. It was clean, well-organized, with delicious food and friendly staff. Not to mention, the planning team at the Presidio, through Wedgewood Weddings, was truly best-in-class. Wedgewood prepared us so well, providing a planning binder and step-by-step instructions. They checked in with us multiple times: providing walk-throughs, and answering every question extremely promptly. We especially loved our planner and day-of coordinator, Christian, who went out of his way to make everything so seamless. Christian taught us how to do our ceremony, including little details such as hand placement, went out of his way to accommodate a creative painting engagement, and provided private time for us newlyweds. He was perfect! So grateful to this beautiful venue and our wonderful team. We will treasure our experience with Wedgewood forever.
