So much love for The Pothos Parlor

My husband and I absolutely loved working with The Pothos Parlor for our wedding! We weren’t interested in incorporating traditional florals, so Lilly’s live plants and rattan stands were the perfect complement to our ceremony and reception spaces. The planning process was thorough—she took the time to visualize and map out our spaces and made thoughtful recommendations that fit our style.  
On the wedding day, everything transitioned seamlessly. Every potted and propagated plant element was placed and repositioned with care between ceremony and reception spaces and Lilly could be trusted to make decisions on the fly as well. We also loved that there was zero floral or product waste. Since all the plants belong to her and are lovingly cared for afterward, we appreciated knowing our décor was both stunning and sustainable.  
If you’re looking for a unique, eco-friendly, and truly gorgeous alternative to traditional florals, we can’t recommend The Pothos Parlor enough!
