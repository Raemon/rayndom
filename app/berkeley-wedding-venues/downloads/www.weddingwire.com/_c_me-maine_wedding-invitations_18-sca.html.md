Mary Anne Lloyd (maryanne@maryannelloyd.com) designed and handled the printing aspect of our Save the Dates and our Invitations. What an artist! She's professional, fun, and she has great ideas. Her style is unlike any other invitation artist that I've seen. The invitations were one of a kind, designed just for me and my hubby. I highly recommend Mary Anne for any kind of invitations. We got so many compliments about our invitations!!

Wide Eyes Paper Co. made our dream of creating a custom deck of cards for our wedding favors come to life in the most seamless and beautiful way. From the very first consultation, their team took the time to understand our vision, offering creative insights that truly elevated the design. Their attention to detail and commitment to quality shone through at every step of the process. The final product was beyond anything we could have imagined—both elegant and personal, perfectly capturing the essence of our celebration. Working with them was a joy, and we are so grateful for the care and creativity they put into such a special part of our wedding day. We highly recommend Wide Eyes Paper Co. for anyone seeking custom, meaningful, and stunning design work!

I can't say enough about Elabria Designs! Angela took my ideas and completely ran with it, creating an AMAZING invitation that will be on display for years to come.. We received countless compliments on how unique, professional and incredible they were, and our Mad Lib RSVP cards was the icing on the cake.. I will definitely go back to Elabria Designs for all of my printing needs!

I needed wedding invitations with a dreamcatcher to incorporate my fiance's native american heritage into the wedding. I found Lorie Michaud through Etsy.com and couldn't be happier. She worked with me daily to make sure my invitations were perfect. I ended up using her ideas for all of my wedding stationary and can't wait for an occasion to use her talents again! I was nervous ordering on line and even more worried when I saw how inexpensive the invitations were but one I received them I was beyond thrilled. I can't say enough about Lorie and her company!
