We had our wedding here in June of 2025 and had a great experience. Overall the staff was responsive, helpful, and ensured our day ran smoothly. The bridal suite space was perfect to get ready in and great for photos, and the boys enjoyed the downstairs area with the pool table and Grooms Suite. We had a couple communication blips during the process when Big Dog transferred event coordinators, where some of our agreed upon event asks were forgotten, and some miscommunication occurred with their new standards of doing things that wasn’t made aware to us upon booking, but overall these issues were corrected and we were able to work everything out. Jose was very helpful the day of in setting things up, and helping our coordinator to make sure the vision was achieved. The wind can get verrrryyyy crazy up in the hills, so that was the one thing we did not accommodate for so our floorplan needed to change last minute to accommodate that, and some of our decor ended up not being able to happen due to the crazy wind. Be sure to think ahead about that! We appreciated BDV’s flexibility with changing the set up last minute, letting us drop off decor early and leave it over night to get the next day etc. They were very accommodating to our requests, which is always helpful during stressful wedding planning. Overall the guests were happy, BDV met every expectation we had agreed upon, and the day went smoothly and as well as it could have! I’d recommend the venue to couples looking for a nice venue with beautiful views, a getting ready area on site, with the ability and freedom to customize your event as you wish.

Our wedding at the Crowne Plaza was spectacular. They helped us every step of the way and the day could not have gone smoother. Every one of my guests enjoyed their food and even told us that this was the best food they have ever eaten at a wedding. They thought of every detail for us and at the end of the night, we were suprised with apple cider (since me and my husband do not drink) and chocolate strawberries in our bridal suite. So happy we chose to have our wedding here.
