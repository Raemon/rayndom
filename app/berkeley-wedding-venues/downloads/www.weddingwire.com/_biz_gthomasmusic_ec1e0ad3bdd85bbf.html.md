Gregg is the absolute best there is!

Where do I even begin?! Gregg's voice and talent is unmatched! From the moment I had my fist call with Gregg I felt completely at ease and confident that he would be perfect for our wedding. Gregg is an extremely gifted, kind, genuine person. I just wish I could have him play at every event I attend! Listening and dancing along with friends and family to Gregg playing "Harvest Moon" (with harmonica included!!!) was truly the best memory from my entire wedding weekend. I had at least 20 guests come up to me to say how incredible his voice was! If you are looking for a guitarist/singer for your event seriously look no further! I cannot put into words how amazing he is!

Just book him already! 

Gregg was an absolute pleasure to work with. From the very beginning, he was responsive, professional, and offered thoughtful guidance as we planned the details of our wedding ceremony. Shortly after our initial call, he followed up with a clear and detailed timeline that reflected everything we had discussed, which gave us complete peace of mind.  
  
But above all, Gregg is a truly exceptional musician. His stunning vocals paired with his skillful guitar playing brought an unforgettable energy and emotion to our ceremony — it was more than we could have hoped for.

Wonderful!

I want to start by saying that Gregg was phenomenal! He played at my daughter’s wedding in Palm Springs during both the ceremony and the cocktail hour. Not only is he an amazing guitarist, but he also plays the harmonica. Gregg's voice is beautiful and pitch-perfect. My husband even thought Neil Young had been hired when he heard him perform “Harvest Moon.” Gregg’s talent shines through as he plays so many classic songs. I found myself swaying while chatting with guests because the music was simply that good. Everyone kept asking, “Where did you find this guy?” In addition to his musical skills, Gregg has a calm demeanor that created a wonderful atmosphere throughout the event. I couldn’t have asked for a better musician. If you’re looking for someone to play at your event, look no further—you’ve found him!

Fantastic Solo Artist!

We were recently married in Northern Wisconsin and cant say enough about our experience with Gregg. He played both at our outdoor Welcome Party and also for our ceremony. The venue and ambiance were quite different at each event and Gregg adapted perfectly. He was very easy to work with and had great input and musical suggestions. We had a few last minute changes which did not phase him at all. Gregg is a great musician but also super easy to work with and made a great addition to our wedding weekend. Many of our guests commented about how nice his music was. We recommend him without reservation!

Music for wedding ceremony in the church and cocktail hour music

Gregg added such a beautiful touch to our wedding weekend. His voice and music added the perfect touch that my husband and I were hoping for at our Northwoods wedding at Coon's Franklin Lodge. Gregg was so pleasant to work with and he accommodated to our music preferences while keeping his unique voice that is so beautiful! I highly recommend Gregg for any future brides!

Wonderful Wedding Song

Gregg learned our requested song, "Soul Mates" by Grant Nicholas, for our wedding in Joshua Tree. He was an excellent musician, listened carefully to the details of our request, and was eager to accommodate our wishes. We could not have asked for a better experience for our special day in Joshua Tree. It provided the perfect accompaniment - we can't recommend Gregg strongly enough!
