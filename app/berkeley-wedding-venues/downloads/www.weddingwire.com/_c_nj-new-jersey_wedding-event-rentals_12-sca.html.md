I worked with Dominique from Dialed In Guestbooks for the audio guestbook at my wedding, and the experience was excellent from start to finish. From my very first inquiry through the wedding day, Dominique was professional, responsive, and efficient. The phone and phone booth looked absolutely beautiful and fit perfectly with our wedding aesthetic. Best of all, the phone was incredibly easy for our guests to use, which made capturing messages effortless and fun. I couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out and highly recommend Dialed In Guestbooks!

Complete Site Solutions provided the best restroom trailers we could have asked for at our outdoor wedding. Jason was easy to reach by email and phone, transparent about pricing, offered great value for price, and made the setup process smooth and stress free. The trailers were spotless, fully stocked, climate-controlled, and even had music. They were perfect for our backyard wedding. Highly recommend Complete Site Solutions for weddings or outdoor events in South Jersey.

Working with Alyssia at Ocra was a dream. Any vision I had she simply jumped at the opportunity to create a finished product. My wedding theme was industrial minimalist and she incorporated a beautiful mix of black, white and stone together for the perfect touches on the day. She created an entire wedding suite that seamlessly matched my decor and even created the stone table numbers that tied it all beautifully together. She is extremely talented, passionate and very easy to work with. Highly recommend, she will make your vision for any party come true stress free!!

We had a great experience renting our chuppah from Mr. and Mrs. Chuppah! We used the cedar chuppah and it looked absolutely beautiful. Their attention to detail with the additional elements we did and didn't need made it so easy to trust them to do what they do best. Additionally, we found out in the weeks leading up to the wedding that the venue needed to tighten up our vendor arrival time. Melissa worked wonderfully with our planner to make sure the delivery and set up happened in partnership with our florist so that everything was ready to go on time!

We cannot recommend Happy Bark and Tails enough—hiring Madeline was truly one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. From the very beginning, Madeline was incredibly attentive, responsive, and an absolute pleasure to work with. We did a meet-and-greet with our dog, Ginger, ahead of time, and it went perfectly, which immediately put us at ease. On the wedding day, Madeline arrived a few hours before the ceremony and cared for Ginger throughout photos, walked her down the aisle during the ceremony, and assisted with additional photos afterward. She handled everything seamlessly and thoughtfully. After the wedding, she even took Ginger home overnight and brought her back to us the next day when we were ready to head home. Having Ginger be part of the best day of our lives meant everything to us, and Madeline made that possible—without us ever having to worry or keep eyes on her. Knowing Ginger was in such loving, capable hands allowed us to fully enjoy our day and dance the night away stress-free. Madeline is kind, professional, and truly exceptional at what she does. We would recommend her to absolutely anyone looking to include their dog in their wedding day. An invaluable service and an unforgettable experience!

We had an excellent experience working with Steve at L&A! He was incredibly detail oriented, willing to both map out digitally and stake out in person the tent location options for our rain plan and sun plan for our backyard wedding. The installation was seamless, including a last minute change to skip the sidewalls and instead go with draping. Steve was there the evening of the wedding to ensure everything went exactly according to plan, which it did! Finally, the team did an efficient job removing the main tent, cooking tent, and restroom trailer in the days after the wedding. Thanks again L&A!

I thought they would ring my neck, because I had so many changes (particulary color.) No complaints. Everything was delivered on schedule and just as we had ordered. They did tables, chairs, tablecloths. I also saw what they did for my niece, which included all of the china, glassware and serveware. They are just a great company to work with.

I am difficult to please and rarely write reviews but I was so impressed by these guys I had to make an exception. We dealt with Hannah who was so patient and helpful even though we changed the order 4 times! we had some weather related issues and she was so understanding and really tried to help. Give this woman a raise!
