Working with Kaylie at Veil Events was hands down one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. We hired Veil Events for their Full Service Planning. Planning a wedding from Sweden could have been incredibly stressful, but Kaylie made the entire process seamless and enjoyable. From start to finish, she was incredibly organized, communicative, and genuinely invested in making our vision come to life. She handled everything—from vendor recommendations and contract reviews to timeline creation and final walkthroughs—so we never had to worry about the details slipping through the cracks. Her expertise and attention to detail were evident in every aspect of the planning process. Even across time zones, she kept us informed and reassured, making it easy to trust that everything was in good hands. There were many FaceTime calls so I could see venues for myself and extra trips downtown to accommodate me, which I truly appreciated. One of the things I valued most was Kaylie’s professionalism in handling tough conversations. She helped communicate my expectations clearly and effectively while ensuring everything stayed on track. As a program director with years of project management experience, I know I can be persistent, but she managed every interaction with patience and grace, which made the process that much smoother. On the wedding day, Kaylie and her team were absolute lifesavers. They managed every setup, transition, and timeline cue effortlessly, allowing us and our families to fully enjoy the day without stress. From making sure we were taken care of to keeping everything running smoothly behind the scenes, they truly thought of everything. If you’re looking for a planner who is organized, supportive, and an absolute joy to work with, I cannot recommend Kaylie and Veil Events enough. Our wedding day was everything we hoped for and more, thanks to their hard work and dedication. And when it’s all over, you’ll even find yourself missing your regular calls with her!

April and Gabi were exactly who and what we needed to take the bride and grooms ideas and make them happen. As the Mother of the Bride, my job was to put all the plans in place. Then I got to step back and enjoy while April and Gabi made it all happen. And that is why I call Ambiance "The gift I give myself" Without them, I would have been attending to details - instead I got to attend to my daughter! Thank you Ambiance!

I fell in love with Monica's Bundt Cake the first time I tried it. I decided to go with a traditional Wedding Cake and Bundt Runts. We received so many compliments about it. They have so many flavors to choose from and it is a very unique twist on the traditional cupcakes. I would recommend Vanilla, Strawberry, and Chocolate-Chocolate Chip. AMAZING!

We were on the fence about using an event planner for our Wedding. We ended up going with Wichita Event Planner, and I am very glad that we did! We were paired with Amber, who was a wonderful fit from the very beginning. Amber helped get us in contact with any remaining vendors that we had not solidified 60 days out. We had several meetings with her prior to our wedding where she asked great, detailed questions to make sure we were all on the same page. She helped us write out our wedding timeline and shared it will all of the vendors making sure they knew when and where. The day of I got to focus on getting ready and enjoying the hair and makeup process while she handled all of the decoration set up and vendor arrivals. I credit how great our decor looked to her. Our wedding went very smoothly. Any bumps or hiccups that happened I didn't even know about until AFTER the wedding, as she and her assistant handled them. At the end of the evening, they packed up all of our decor and had the venue cleaned out for us. We very much appreciate all of their hard work. If you're on the fence, I would highly recommend booking with Wichita Event Planner and using Amber. It allows you to enjoy your big day without the stress. I didn't fight with family, I didn't worry about decor, and I didn't wonder if my vendors had arrived. She handled all of the stress and let us enjoy. It was worth every penny.

Kellen was, without a doubt, one of the best decisions we made when planning our wedding. She brought professionalism, insight, and enthusiasm into every ounce of her work. Our special day would not have gone so wonderfully without her. She worked incredibly hard to make sure we didn't have to worry and we will forever be grateful. I highly recommend Kellen's services to any bride who is looking for a fun and hard working wedding planner.

Wilkens made my life SO much easier. The only thing I would go back and change...is to have them do the entire wedding! They did as little or as much as we wanted them to do. They did our flowers, ceremony decor, and reception decor. When I walked into the reception I was blown away. They really captured the theme I was going for and nailed it. They set up and take down which was so nice to not have to worry about anything and actually enjoy our wedding weekend. I would hire them a thousand times over again. We had our dream wedding with their amazing help!

Where to even start, The owner Krista and I have been through everything you could imagine trying to plan my wedding. We had venue closures, COVID 19 you name it. Throughout the whole long process she never lost sight of my vision and kept me calm and handled everything from switching dates, reprinting invitations 3 times, design for 3 different venues, the list goes on. On the day of the wedding I did not have one vendor coming up to me or my mom asking us one single question the whole entire day! That is why we hired a wedding planner and The AGE team did a phenomenal job in making the day run smooth and stress free. I can not recommend Addison Grace Events enough!
