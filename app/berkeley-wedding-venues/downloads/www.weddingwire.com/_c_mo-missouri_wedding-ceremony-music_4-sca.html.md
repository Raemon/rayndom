I'm no expert in the wedding industry, but David handled everything which made my life so easy! He has great examples on his website of song recommendations and past venues he's played at. I booked online, filled out his music form and that was it. I didn't have to coordinate anything else and all the guests loved him. Our wedding was at the Sheldon so the live piano was perfect for the ceremony

The Guitar Duo performed at my outdoor wedding and their beautiful playing exceeded our expectations! Prior to the wedding they were incredibly and quickly responsive to any email or questions we had. They even played two songs that weren’t on their list but that we really wanted played at our ceremony. They were also very kind to talk to. Would recommend to anyone wanting a beautiful addition to their event!

Marilyn quickly responded and was a breeze to work with. We picked several favorites and she made helpful recommendations and asked questions so it was all planned. The musicians were outstanding, on time, did their thing, and made for an elegant touch to the most special day. We would book them again!

Eileen is a great musician who was a pleasure to work with in planning and performing my wedding ceremony music. She was willing to learn new music of any genre which was extremely helpful as I had some unique song choices which weren't on her playlist. One minor suggestion is to use a small sound system to amplify the harp if you plan to have an outdoor wedding. Her beautiful music was a wonderful addition to our ceremony. I highly recommend Eileen, you will not be disappointed.

Arranging for the ceremony music with Sarah from Serenade St. Louis was one of the easiest parts of the planning process. This was a great value for one hour of the duo (violin and cello). The musicians sounded beautiful and added the perfect touch to our ceremony!

We had a violin and acoustic guitar play at our ceremony. The music was so beautiful! Everyone was talking about it throughout the reception. Paul was very responsive and knew a ton of different songs from various genres. He even learned how to play a few songs for us. I am so incredibly happy we chose Noteworthy Music for our ceremony. I definitely recommend them to anyone who wants a more acoustic vibe.

Amanda was great to work with. She was very responsive and had many musical selections from which to choose. I opted for a harpist and violinist for the ceremony and cocktail hour. From what I can recall (b/c the day flew so quickly!), the music was beautiful and perfect for the setting. The women were both so courteous and talented. Even my Pastor commented on how he loves going early to ceremonies to listen to Amanda play! If I have another event, she is on the top of my list for live music.
