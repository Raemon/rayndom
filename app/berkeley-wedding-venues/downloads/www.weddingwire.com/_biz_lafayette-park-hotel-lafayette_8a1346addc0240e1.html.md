Great wedding venue!

The Lafayette Hotel and Spa was an amazingly beautiful venue for our small wedding.   
From the moment we decided to use this venue to a few dats after the wedding, we were supported in every way possible.   
Kimberly and Kim were easily accessible to answer any questions and were flexible with our wedding plans.   
On our wedding day, they checked in with us and made everything proceed with ease.   
The catering team made sure our food and service were on point! The food was excellent and our guests were very impressed!  
I am so happy that we can add the Lafayette Hotel and Spa to our beautiful wedding memories 💖 Thank you for the perfect wedding!!

Beautiful local hotel that offers unique charm and a sense of luxury. 

We loved having our wedding here and felt confident in having the hotel be home for guests (our wedding consisted of around 90% out of towners). While our actual venue coordinator ended up switching three or so times during the process due to turnover, the hotel staff kept in contact and made sure we knew who their next representative was going to be. Their reservation staff are helpful and friendly and the days leading up to the wedding/day of were seamless for both guest check-in and vendors. Banquet staff are well trained, highly professional and kept the dinner moving efficiently even during the programmed parts of the evening. The staff even decorated our room and made sure we had desserts night of :) I would highly recommend working with this venue for your wedding. My husband and I are definitely making a point to come back for our anniversaries to take advantage of their spa!

My husband and I were married at the Lafayette Park Hotel in the wishing well courtyard last summer. The staff and our wedding planner Lolita were amazing! They handled everything exactly the way we wanted it to be done. The food was amazing! I still have friends and family tell me that 6 months later. I would highly recommend their services to anyone planning a wedding or large gathering.

We stayed two nights for our "mini-moon" and also scheduled a couple's massage at the spa. Complimentary champagne was sent to our room. Gorgeous, amazing hotel. Like a dream. The room service food was incredible, especially the breakfast salmon, the crab salad, and the French onion soup.

This hotel was absolutely beautiful. It was the perfect location for my small wedding. The wedding coordinator Andi Berner was so awesome to work with. Everything was the way I wanted it to be! I definitely recommend this venue if you are looking for a sweet, simple, and romantic wedding. The wishing well courtyard was perfect because it already has flowers growing there. You won't need to spend money decorating very much. I'm so happy I picked this venue for my wedding.   
  
To anyone considering this venue, make sure you check with the reservations department if you reserve any rooms. I had some issues with them getting my name and other guests names right on the rooms. Checking in the day of the wedding was kind of irritating. But as far as all the wedding stuff goes it was amazing!
