Budget friendly glamorous bachelorette experience ill never forget.

I wanted something different for my bachelorette weekend. This was glamorous, relaxing and fun, but still budget-friendly. We decorated the tents, sipped mimosas, and started our days with yoga and meditation in the meadow. We brought in a massage therapist, went tubing at Sacandaga, and even made it to the Saratoga races. It was peaceful, playful, and unforgettable. We’ll be talking about it for years.

Perfect setting for our intimate wedding

Glampful provided the beautiful, peaceful, and private setting we wanted for our affordable and bespoke micro wedding. We enjoyed every moment with our guests, from the meadow photos to the dinner and campfire. The Glampful team was wonderful, and we highly recommend them!

Unforgettable Glamping Wedding Experience

My wife and I had the most incredible micro wedding at Glampful, and I can’t stop raving about it to friends and family. From the moment we arrived, it felt like a dream. The location was intimate, breathtakingly beautiful, and perfectly curated it felt like a retreat in nature with all the comforts of luxury.  
  
The Glampful team went above and beyond to make sure every detail reflected our vision. From the cozy glamping tents to the string lights that lit up the evening sky, everything was magical. The setting made our photos look straight out of a fairy tale.  
  
What really stood out was the care and attention to detail. We never felt rushed or overlooked. Our guests kept commenting on how unique and special the experience was not your typical wedding venue, and that's what made it unforgettable.  
  
If you’re looking for a stress-free, one-of-a-kind wedding that feels both intentional and adventurous, this is it. I highly recommend Glampful to any couple looking for something personal, beautiful, and unforgettable. They deserve all the stars!

Perfect Proposal 

My sister and I were planning a surprise weekend getaway and proposal for her girlfriend when we found this beautiful place! Her girlfriend loves the outdoors and even had a whole Pinterest board full of dream proposal photos—and this spot made all those dreams come true. Everything was beyond perfect (and she said yes!). The location was amazing, and the photos turned out absolutely gorgeous! The staff were also soo accommodating and kind and made the whole experience incredible!!
