As the father of the bride, I honestly had some doubts that The Farmhouse could make my daughter’s wedding perfect. We were planning a smaller wedding (105 guests or so), and based on reviews, my daughter chose the venue. I felt comfortable after our initial visit, but still was skeptical. Well, fast forward to rehearsal day, and after walking into our setup room, my doubts quickly vanished. The venue was beautifully decorated, and the grounds were fully maintained. Our coordinators had us perfectly prepared. The night was magical! We had ample room for a dancefloor, Schaffer Sound keep the party going nonstop after all the preliminaries, and also provided up-lighting in the venue. The sound was perfect! Our dinners were promptly served hot and delicious. Our guests were delighted! Our families and friends had a wonderful time! And The Farmhouse venue and staff played a major role in our perfect wedding day! Thank you so much! The father of the bride

From the very first visit, we knew this venue was something special. Even when we toured on a rainy day, it still felt breathtaking and absolutely gorgeous—it truly didn’t need any extra “filling in” to see its beauty and potential. But what really made our experience seamless was our Day-of Planner, Hannah. She was the heartbeat of the venue. From the start, Hannah was responsive, kind, and incredibly knowledgeable. She answered every question we had and even shared a helpful list of preferred vendors. When a few vendors weren’t as responsive, Hannah stepped right in to assist with coordination and kept everything moving smoothly. She went above and beyond with thoughtful suggestions—from color schemes to small details that other brides have found helpful—making sure we felt supported every step of the way. On the wedding day itself, Hannah ensured everything ran flawlessly. Our guests raved about how wonderful she was, and we truly couldn’t agree more. Me and my partner couldn’t have asked for a better experience. The venue was stunning, the process was stress-free, and Hannah made it all feel effortless. It was absolutely perfect. 💍✨

Our wedding at Hopkins Heartland the “Honey Bee” venue was a dream come true! From the moment we completed our first tour we knew this was the place we wanted to get married at. From start to finish there was not a moment a staff member was not there to help, from the simplest questions that came up throughout our planning process as well as all throughout the wedding day! This venue offers so much, from the beautiful farmland views to the little peaceful areas to kind of tuck away for a few. I would recommend this venue to anyone couple who is interested in small town rustic vibes. We were able to create memories that will last FOREVER!!

I can’t recommend this venue enough. This family has the sweetest most caring humans I have ever met. What started as a quick request for a 30min max vow exchange turned into an evening I will truly never forget. Laura and Jon went above and beyond. They were responsive, flexible, and so attentive. They made sure we had an evening to remember and I will never be more grateful for the experience they gave us. Not only is this lavender farm absolutely stunning, but it is run by a beautiful family as well both inside and out. Thank you for everything ❤️
