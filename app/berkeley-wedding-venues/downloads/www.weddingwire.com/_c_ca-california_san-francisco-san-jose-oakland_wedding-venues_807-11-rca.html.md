We hosted our October 2023 Wedding Ceremony at Hakone and we were so happy with the beautiful gardens and overall experience. The staff at Hakone (Tony and Melia) were extremely helpful, friendly, and easy to work with and they went above and beyond to make sure our rehearsal and ceremony went smoothly. We requested a unique setup with two aisles and we had a large decoration to attach to an arch we rented through a vendor, and they worked with both us and our vendors to make sure that everything was set up just right with plenty of time to spare. They also helped us work through all the important details of the ceremony without being overwhelming, and they did a perfect job executing on the actual ceremony, queuing our party to walk and managing the music and sound system. The garden itself is beautiful in any season. We visited multiple times throughout the year leading up to our wedding and enjoyed different plants in bloom every time. In October, the garden was still lush and green with redwoods, bamboo, and the Koi pond providing amazing variety. Our guests had a great time strolling through the gardens before and after the ceremony, and there were tons of amazing backdrops for our wedding photos. They even gave us a complimentary year-long membership following our wedding so we could come back to relive the memories! In summary, we highly recommend Hakone whether for a wedding ceremony or just a visit!

We had our wedding of 165 people here in October. And it was absolutely stunning! I would recommend this to anyone looking to get married in the area. The bridal suite was gorgeous and there was also a place for the groom to get ready. Kristin was very communicative throughout the planning process and lightened the stress load off my shoulders. Hope was the best day of coordinator and I would have my wedding here again in a heartbeat! Along with the professional team that helped out the day of. Many compliments from our guests as well.

Our wedding day didn’t go exactly as planned—but in the most beautiful way possible. From the moment we booked the venue, we knew we had found a hidden gem. The space was absolutely stunning and incredibly affordable compared to others we looked at. Every corner felt romantic and well thought out, and we were truly blown away by the value we received. But what made our experience truly unforgettable was Carolina, the venue coordinator. When a few unforeseen challenges came our way (as they sometimes do with weddings), Carolina handled every single issue with such grace, confidence, and calm. She truly became the hero of our day, stepping in and making adjustments without ever letting us feel stressed. Her professionalism and kindness turned potential chaos into seamless beauty. Thanks to her and the amazing team, our wedding turned out to be the most beautiful day of our lives. Everything came together in a way that felt magical. We were able to soak in every moment, surrounded by love and beauty, without worrying about a thing. If you’re considering this venue—don’t hesitate. You’ll get more than you pay for in all the best ways. We couldn’t be more grateful for the experience and for Carolina’s unwavering support. Our hearts are full!

We had the most amazing wedding in July here at Willow Heights Mansion!!! Our day was beyond perfect. Everything from the planning process to the day of the wedding went so smoothly thanks to all of the vendors and especially our coordinator Christina!! We were so nervous leading up to the wedding day, but once we met Christina during our rehearsal we knew she would do an incredible job. She made sure to update us throughout our wedding day, kept track of all of our guests, made sure we had a meal/drink ready at our sweetheart table waiting for us after our ceremony and kept checking in with us to make sure we didn’t need anything else. She kept us on track and on time for everything throughout the whole day. I didn’t have to worry about a single thing. I could not recommend this venue and Christina enough!! We cannot thank this team enough for making our day so special and memorable❤️

We cannot recommend Emily and Janciz at City Club enough! They truly were the dream team that made our wedding experience completely stress-free and enjoyable, both during the planning process and on the big day. From our very first consultation, they were incredibly organized, proactive, and responsive. Planning a wedding can be overwhelming, but Emily and Janciz were always ten steps ahead, ensuring every detail was covered well in advance. Their level of professionalism and expertise was immediately apparent. We had to go back and forth on the Banquet Event Order many times because some things we thought would be fun to add (lamb shanks, french fry station, etc.) ended up compounding in price with surcharges and taxes. But, they were very willing to help us with our requests. They made us feel completely supported and heard throughout the entire journey. On the day of the wedding, everything ran flawlessly. They were constantly on top of every detail, allowing us to relax and fully immerse ourselves in the celebration. City Club is a beautiful venue, but Emily and Janciz are the incredible people who truly bring the experience to life. If you are considering City Club, you are in the best hands possible with Janciz!

The people working at the catering and events department are great! They are responsive, patient and very helpful in addressing all my questions/concerns. I planned my own wedding and they made my experience much easier since the venue took care of things such as catering, beverages, set-up, and some rentals. I must say that everyone I had the pleasure of dealing with were polite, helpful, and took their jobs seriously which made the experience as stress free as possible. The chef went out of his way to handle the dietary restrictions of my guests and the food was great. Good sized servings and tasty. The staff who worked my event were also friendly and accommodating. I received very positive feedback from my guests regarding the food, the atmosphere and the staff. Honestly, if I had to do it all over again, I'd still pick the same venue. I had a great wedding and I think that was largely because I chose the Hyatt Centric and worked with their wonderful staff.

My husband and I held our wedding reception at the Bridges Golf Club, the Garden Pavilion room, and we were so delighted at how beautiful everything turned out! We worked with Sharon, who was highly responsive, flexible, and answered our many questions. Sharon was honest and provided great recommendations for the food, table layout, timeline, etc. Her feedback and wonderful communication skills made the wedding planning process so smooth. The wedding day was a breeze. The staff at the Bridges were on top of things and were on schedule. The table settings were beautiful, the staff were kind and professional, and the setting was stunning. Our guests were blown away by the spectacular views of the canyon, and took epic sunset photos. The staff always checked in on my husband and I to ensure we had sufficient food and drinks. Speaking of food, the food was so delicious! With Sharon's recommendation, we selected the prime rib, salmon, and ravioli. The portions were generous, and the guests were very impressed by the quality! We also had an open bar, and everyone enjoyed the quality of the drinks. We would recommend the Bridges without hesitation! Thanks Bridges for making our wedding day so magical.

##  The Perfect San Francisco Wedding Venue 

San Francisco is known nationally and globally as a cultural hotspot. It's a one of a kind area where many different people have come together to create a truly beautiful thing. Let us help you find the perfect wedding venue for you and your future-spouse! 

##  Popular San Francisco Wedding Venues & Prices 

If you can imagine it, it's probably a wedding venue, and it's probably in San Francisco. Sorry to people who want a wedding in space, we just aren't quite there yet! If you're looking to keep your feet firmly on the ground, popular wedding locations in San Francisco include: golf course, yacht clubs, and mansions. 

Golf courses and mansions/ estates are great places to experience California weather while having the option to go inside. If you and your fiancé(e) are interested in trying on your sea legs, a cruise ship/ boat maybe the wedding venue of your dreams. 

More unique San Francisco wedding venues include several museums, a garden, or even a zoo! The sky's the limit when looking to book a San Francisco wedding venue. 

In terms of price, the average total wedding price in San Francisco is around $43,119, which is about $14,000 over the national average of $29,000. Don't worry if your wedding budget varies from the average. Each couple is planning a unique wedding. 

##  Travel & Hotel Accommodations 

There are two airports in the San Francisco area for out-of-town guests. The first is San Francisco International Airport. A drive from the airport to wedding locations in the city will take about 15-30 minutes depending on traffic. A train is also available with a ride time of about 30 minutes. If you're wedding venue is in the heart of the city, closer to Daly City of San Mateo, this is probably the best choice for out of town guests. If your reception venue or hotel is closer to Oakland, guests could consider flying into Oakland International Airport as well. 

A hotel in San Francisco for the night is about $217. It's not ideal for have guests to book rooms in various hotels if they don't have their own transportation from the hotel to the venue and back. We suggest looking at this awesome [wedding hotel block](https://hotelblocks.weddingwire.com "Wedding Hotel Block") service. Representatives will find rooms for your guests that are affordable and near your ceremony and/or reception locations. 

##  Weather Considerations 

Weather in San Francisco is ideal for outdoor or open air wedding venues. It has a mediterranean climate with dry warm summers and mild winters. However, it's important to note that because San Francisco is located on a grid of about 40 hills, weather and sky conditions can vary greatly based on altitude. All in all it's a the weather is fairly pleasant all year long. 

The warm season lasts from the middle of June to the Middle of October with daily high temperatures above 69 degrees. With very little chance of rain, the summers in the San Francisco Bay area are perfect for outdoor or waterfront wedding venues. Even the hottest days in September have an average high of 73 degrees. Just make sure if your wedding is outdoor, your guests have a way to get out of the sun and cool down if necessary. 

The cold season, which isn't incredibly cold, lasts from the beginning of December to the beginning of February with daily high temperatures below 58 degrees. The coldest days will likely be around the end of December. Outdoor wedding venues are still an option, though it is likely to rain a large portion of Febraury. Just make sure you and your guests are properly dressed for the weather. 

When you're ready to start your search for San Francisco wedding venues, WeddingWire has everything you need to find and book the perfect wedding venue.
