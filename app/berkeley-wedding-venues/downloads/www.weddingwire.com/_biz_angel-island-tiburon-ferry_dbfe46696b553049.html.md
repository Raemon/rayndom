Engagement party on boat

I booked a surprise engagement party on a vessel leaving to/from Tiburon, working closely with Ashley leading up to the event. I have nothing but positive things to say about Ashley & team, everything from planning to day-of logistics went smoothly. All guests had an incredible time sailing past Angel Island, the Golden Gate Bridge, and Sausalito. The bar on- board was great & convenient as well and all the staff members were so friendly. I would absolutely plan another event with Ashley in a heartbeat and if anyone is considering, would highly highly recommend. Thanks to the team for such a special & unforgettable day :)

Wedding Ferry ride

If we could give more than 5 stars, we would! Ashley was absolutely amazing to work with. She made our wedding planning so easy - very attentive, responsive, and gave us all the information we needed to plan from afar (we live in London!) We decorated the way we wanted to, and Ashley helped set it all up the day before. The ferry ride itself was beautiful and smooth and everyone enjoyed themselves immensely. HUGE thank you to Ashley and the crew. They were incredible. I would do another event with them again in a heartbeat.

A beautiful ferry ride for our special day

The Ferry and Ashley were absolutely amazing and such a pleasure to work with. they took the time to learn about what we were looking for and really made it come to life. Everyone loved their time on the water. It made the day that much more special. All we can say is HIRE THE FERRY FOR YOUR SPECIAL DAY!!
