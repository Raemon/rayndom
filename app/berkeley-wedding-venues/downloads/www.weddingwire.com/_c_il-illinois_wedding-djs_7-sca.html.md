DJ Spex was absolutely phenomenal. From start to finish, he was professional, reliable, and incredibly easy to work with. He came fully prepared with all of his own equipment and delivered a flawless setup. Most importantly, he kept the dance floor packed all night. Our wedding wouldn't have been the same without him. Highly recommend DJ Spex to anyone looking for a true pro.

I cannot recommend Enchanted Evenings enough! DJ Mike was phenomenal to work with—he read the room, our guests, and our vibe effortlessly. He went above and beyond our expectations and truly made our night unforgettable. We wouldn’t have wanted anyone else, and we genuinely wish we could relive the entire evening. Do yourself a favor and hire him for your special day—you won’t regret it.

We truly cannot say enough amazing things about Tony Ho from Sounds Abound. He made our entire wedding day feel seamless from start to finish. We actually hired him not only as our DJ, but also as our officiant — so he played a huge role in our day, and he absolutely exceeded every expectation. He wrote a beautiful, personalized ceremony for us and was incredibly organized throughout the whole process. He sent detailed questionnaires to gather everything he needed, and it was so clear how thoughtful, experienced, and intentional he is. As a DJ, he was just as amazing. He was super organized, kept the entire night running smoothly, and made the reception so much fun. We were able to pick our must-play songs in his portal and even share playlists for cocktail hour and dinner, and he made sure every part of the day sounded exactly the way we wanted. He played all of our favorites, kept the energy high, and created such a fun atmosphere. Our dance floor was packed all night. We had conga lines, a special New York Frank Sinatra moment for our NYC guests, and just nonstop great vibes. Tony truly started the day by giving us a heartfelt ceremony and ended it by throwing the best party ever. We honestly can’t thank him enough. We would highly, highly recommend him to any couple!

We hired Tim as our wedding DJ and truly couldn’t have asked for anything better! From the very beginning, he was the most responsive vendor we worked with. He checked in regularly before the big day, communicated clearly, and made the whole process feel so easy. Oh, and he is seriously the most friendly human! He worked seamlessly with our day-of coordinator, and when the wedding day arrived, everything was smooth sailing. You can tell he has this down to a science; in the best way possible!! The music, the transitions, the energy… all flawless. We had so many guests come up to us saying it was the best DJ/music they’ve ever experienced at a wedding. That says everything! And I’m so happy we went with the uplighting—seriously, it made all the difference for the vibe and tied the whole night together. If you’re considering Tim, do yourself a favor and book him. He made our night unforgettable!

We couldn’t have asked for a better DJ than JPW Productions for our wedding! From the very beginning, Jon was incredibly professional and made the entire process smooth and stress-free. He took the time to understand our music tastes and curated the perfect soundtrack for our big day. His mixing was flawless—every transition was seamless, and the dance floor stayed packed all night long. Our guests are still talking about the amazing vibe he created! The lighting was equally impressive. The uplighting added a beautiful, vibrant glow to our venue and truly elevated the entire atmosphere. It complemented the music perfectly and created a magical ambiance that made the night feel even more special. And let’s not forget the photo booth—it was a huge hit! Our guests had so much fun snapping photos, and the energy around it was contagious. The photo album we received, filled with fun pictures and sweet notes from our guests, has become one of our favorite keepsakes from the wedding. We highly recommend Jon and JPW Productions to anyone looking for a talented, reliable, and personable DJ. If you want to create unforgettable memories with amazing music, stunning lighting, and an incredible photo booth experience, look no further!

We had an excellent experience with Style Matters DJs! Are music taste is the opposite of wedding music and these guys get it! Spencer was great to work with, responsive, reasonable pricing, and matched us with our DJ, Jonathan who totally understood the assignment! We created pretty extensive playlists because we are big music people and he nailed it! Great dj skills mixing and making all the transitions fun! He was on time and everyone had a blast! Thank you Jonathan and Spencer!!!

We had DJ Alan from Okyne Media Lab for our wedding at Artifact Events, and he was absolutely fantastic. Throughout the night and days after, many guests came up to us to say how much they loved the music and how incredible our DJ was. The song selection from start to finish was spot on, and he kept the energy perfect for every moment. Okyne’s planning portal was also a huge help. It was easy to upload songs for each part of the wedding, highlight must-play tracks, and add playlists we wanted incorporated. DJ Alan executed everything flawlessly, including hitting all of the cues for both of our ceremonies. As a mixed-culture couple, we really wanted a blend of Bollywood and English music. DJ Alan nailed the balance perfectly and read the room so well. The mix kept everyone on the dance floor all night. The only small downside was that we didn’t find out who our DJ would be until a few days before, and most communication beforehand was through others at the company. But in the end, everything worked out wonderfully, and we couldn’t have been happier with how the night turned out. We would highly recommend Okyne Media Lab and DJ Alan for any wedding, especially if you’re looking for a DJ who can seamlessly blend cultures, keep the dance floor full, and deliver an unforgettable night.

Toast & Jam DJs were fantastic!! Mary (the owner) was awesome about helping us understand the process, finding a package that worked for us at a great price, and pairing us with the **perfect** DJ! It certainly helped that Mary and DJ Emily E were fun & easy to talk to AND were familiar with our rather weird, niche tastes in music, haha! Emily played music that perfectly fit the vibe we were going for (even outside of our playlist suggestions). Even certain well-timed touches with the lighting from the "Gig bar" helped to make special moments like our first dance even more magical! She also made sure that there was something for everyone at each phase of the event, so that guests of all ages had a great time! She was also an amazing MC, bringing just enough energy and personality without being overly involved or disrupting the mood or flow of the event. I cannot recommend them enough!
