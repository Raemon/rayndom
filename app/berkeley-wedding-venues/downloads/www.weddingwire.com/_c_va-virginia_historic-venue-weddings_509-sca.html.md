We did a full buyout of the space for a 160 person wedding in May 2025, and I would highly recommend this venue for a wedding! There are many nice picturing-taking spots around the property. We were able to get some more nature focused pictures outside and then moved inside to capture the wonderful industrial feel of the space. We had about 20 tables of 8-9 people and it didn't feel cramped. The food was amazing and almost exactly like what we tried at the tasting. The staff was great during the event. We had to move our ceremony inside and they did the room flip to cocktail hour super quickly! Although it was pricey, we appreciate that the Wool Factory handled everything that had to do the with tables, we did not need to rent plates, napkins, glassware, etc and it was nice to just have all of that tied in with the food and beverage. The only downsides I would mention was that communication was a bit slow (I often had to send a followup email to get a response), the beer options were not given to us until 30 days before, and we had to rent chairs for the tables since they only provided benches. Also they had a strict "no bare feet" on the dance floor, which is totally understandable, but I wish I would have know beforehand so that I could have warned my guests to bring flats in addition to their heels. Overall, it was a beautiful venue and we had an amazing day!

The Historic Martin Mansion is a truly unforgettable experience. Every detail of the venue, from the rustic decor to the stunning study, is completely captivating! My wife and I had the privilege of having our wedding ceremony and reception at the mansion and we cannot recommend it enough. The team we worked with (especially Jen!) were incredibly professional, caring, and patient. They moved mountains on any request we had to make our special day truly feel like our own. The team was by our side in the planning process every step of the way, particularly as we went with a package that let the mansion manage many aspects of the wedding. The rate we received was incredibly competitive and left us feeling like we got an enormous amount of value for our money. If you're thinking about a wedding in the Norfolk area, we highly recommend The Martin Mansion. If you can, visit the venue in person - that was all it took for us to fall in love.

Growing up I always knew I wanted to get married at Main Street Station! When we walked in, we immediately fell in love! The Headhouse architecture is STUNNING and simply speaks for itself! Crystal, the venue manager, helped to answer our many questions and was extremely flexible and accommodative through the whole wedding process! Thanks so much to Main Street for hosting the best day of our lives! \- The Romeos

We did a group tour about 10 months before the wedding date. My daugher was a bit stressed out as time was of the essense. Ellie, one of the coordinators, led the tour and after speaking directly with her following the tour I was sold. My daughter was sold after seeing the bridal and groomsmen suites, but for me it was the warm feeling I got from Ellie. She assured me we could achieve our vision in the time we had and she would make sure of it. For those who don't know, they offer wedding coordinator services for and additonal fee in addition to the venue. BEST MONEY EVER SPENT!!! I could not have asked for a better companion for this journey. Ellie kept us on schedule, helped us with caterer recommendations, as well as, DJ, photograher, florist and even someone to assist with the ceremony. She offered up great ideas for our Christmas wedding. The venue is gorgeous on its own, but dressed up simply for Christmas was absolutely stunning. The suites are the spacious and furnished beautifully, lots of mirrors and space for the girls to get ready and the groomsmen suite has a pool table and kitchen to keep them entertained. This venue is a 10 out of 10 in every way. The building itself is stunning, but the people - they put this place over the top! Highly recommend the venue and the wedding coordinator services.

Madison at the Mill was the perfect blend of rustic and industrial with the barn doors and beautiful wood everything and the high exposed ceilings with pipework showing. It matched our personalities quite well and the space is large and open without feeling too large. Their bride/groom suites were perfect for the day of and their many many bathrooms came in handy during the reception, no one waited for a bathroom all night!! Robert and Shalese are so sweet and helpful throughout the whole process. We don't live close to Orange, VA so there were many emails exchanged with many questions and there were quick to respond and answer them all! People raved about the space and I am so grateful to them both for making our wedding day so wonderful!!

My fiancé and I recently had the pleasure of touring Bella Rose for our upcoming wedding, and we couldn't be more impressed with our experience. The sales director, Kate went above and beyond to ensure that all of our questions were answered and that we felt comfortable every step of the way. She took the time to understand our vision for our special day and provided valuable insights and recommendations to help bring it to life. Their attention to detail and genuine enthusiasm made us feel confident that we were in good hands. One of the standout features of the venue is its all-inclusive model, which truly takes the stress out of the wedding planning process. The thought of coordinating multiple vendors and logistics can be overwhelming, but knowing that everything from catering to decor is handled in-house by a team of professionals gives us peace of mind. It allows us to focus on enjoying the journey leading up to our big day, rather than getting bogged down in the minutiae of planning. Overall, our experience left us feeling excited and eager to start the next chapter of our lives together. The combination of the exceptional sales team and the all-inclusive model makes Bella Rose or any other Entwined Events venue the perfect choice for couples looking for a seamless and stress-free wedding planning experience.

We absolutely adore Seven Springs and wish we could relive our day over and over again. From the first tour all the way to the end of our wedding night, Tracy was insanely helpful and sweet to us! We knew as soon as toured that this was our venue and sitting down with Tracy only confirmed it. Seven Springs is not only a stunning venue that all our guests raved about but also has a staff that truly cares about your day and making it the most special. There is not a negative thing I could say, I would seriously recommend this venue to every single person I know, it was so so special! Thank you to Tracy and her whole team for making our wedding planning and day so great and easy, we seriously wouldn't have changed a thing!
