Hiring Holly was by far the best decision we made planning this wedding! We wanted to have the wedding at my parents house, but we had never had an event on the scale of a wedding there before. So we knew there was going to be a lot of different work involved with planning than if we were to hold it at a typical venue, like figuring out bathrooms, where the caterer would store food and how far apart tables would be. And long story short, we would have been TOTALLY lost without Holly! She has an amazing ability to listen to our vague and probably confusing ideas and turning them into beautiful realities. Even throughout the chaos of postponing our wedding due to COVID and then dealing with rain on our wedding day, she was totally on it at every step of the way. And on top of that, she is just a really cool person and it was a joy to get to hang out with her during our monthly wedding calls for nearly two years. Also for anyone else who is considering hiring Holly (which you totally should just do now and stop looking), my biggest piece of advice is to listen to her recommendations for other vendors. Because she's worked with so many people in the industry, she has great relationships with tons of top-notch vendors in the area. When we were first picking our team, there were a couple of instances where I had found a company on social media or through other referrals that I was leaning toward hiring over the vendors she had suggested. She was never pushy with her recommendations and in the few cases where I did pick different options, she was totally supportive. But with most of them, we ended up going with her recommendations because we trusted her vision, and they turned out to be the best options we possibly could have had. As a bonus, some of them even gave us discounts because they prefer to work with Holly and her team. All in all, working with Holly and her team was an amazing experience!! Our wedding was the most beautiful, magical day and we can't thank her enough!

Kyra and her team are absolutely incredible! From our first meeting with Kyra all the way through the day of our Wedding I had complete confidence in her ability and commitment to executing my wife's vision for our day. Do yourself a favor and go with her full service, it will be worth every cent! Kyra and team are focused and gracious, efficient and adaptable, patient and considerate, reliable, responsive, accessible, kind, reassuring, dependable; Having such a trustworthy and supportive team in our corner through this process helped ease my wife's stress in a big way- I could not be more grateful. If you're reading this and wondering if Kyra and her team are the right people to help you with your event, stop wondering and start hiring A Summers' Day. You will thank yourself almost immediately!

When we started the wedding planning process, we knew we wanted to hire a day of coordinator. My career is in project management, but I wouldn't have been able to be as prepared and organized without the help of Composure. I researched and interviewed 4 local planning companies and knew Composure was the right fit because of their experience and professionalism. I highly recommend Composure for any wedding planning needs. Although we only used them for "day-of-coordinating", it still came with numerous benefits such as weekly email reminders and tips that you should be thinking about, regular check-ins and an above and beyond service on the day of your wedding. I received SO many compliments from my wedding party and family on how great Genevieve and her team were on the wedding day. Any potential hiccup was handled expeditiously and without my knowledge. I didn't have to worry about a thing on my wedding day.

We cannot say enough amazing things about ThirtyOneThirty Events! They stepped in just 60 days before our wedding and made the entire process stress-free and enjoyable. Amy, our lead planner, was absolutely incredible- organized, calm, and always one step ahead. She handled every detail with professionalism and care, making sure our vision came to life perfectly. Thanks to Amy and the ThirtyOneThirty team, our wedding day was seamless and everything we dreamed of. We highly recommend them to every bride looking for a dedicated, talented, and reliable planning team!

Kat is seriously the best! I cannot say enough good things about her. Kat was one of the first decisions we made for our wedding and I’m so happy we did. We were engaged for a little over 2 years and Kat worked with us for most of it. We were initially not planning on hiring a wedding coordinator to help save some money, but we thought we would at least meet with a few people to see what they offered. Once we met Kat though, she blew everyone else out of the park and we knew right then we needed her. Not only was she affordable, but she was so knowledgeable about all things wedding related. She answered any questions we had (and there were a lot) and made our entire planning process literally stress-free. You can tell Kat truly loves what she does. She’s so on top of everything. I swear she was always 3 steps ahead of us when it came to getting things done! She’s professional, punctual, and truly the best at what she does. And to top it all off, she’s got such a great personality. She’s fun and so easy to talk to. My husband and I are actually sad we won’t be seeing her anymore. Our favorite wedding-related activity was meeting with Kat! If there’s anything you do right during your wedding planning process, it will be hiring Kat. I promise you won’t be disappointed in the least. She will go beyond even your highest expectations. HIRE HER!!!!

I can never thank Tiffany and Amanda enough for giving us the most beautiful wedding day. In addition to month-of-coordination, they also helped oversee all the design elements of our wedding - linens, florals, lighting, etc. While I had the big picture elements in mind, having their expert guidance to oversee these design-related vendors was the best decision we made. They were able to take my initial, unorganized ideas, identify which vendors worked best and make all the arrangements. It made what should be the most enjoyable part of wedding planning truly enjoyable! And while we worked closely as they finalized all the details, seeing the vision come together on that day was still astounding. We completely trusted their recommendations, and if you choose to hire Amanda and Tiffany for your wedding, you can rest easy, trusting them to create the most beautiful day to celebrate your marriage. Aside from the design elements, Tiffany and Amanda also navigated our tricky day-of timeline with an overbooked church. Their expert oversight helped the day go by completely smoothly, all while we could simply take in the special day with our loved ones. We highly recommend you take the time to meet Tiffany and Amanda in person to talk about your wedding. We are confident once you do, you will be as smitten as we were.

The day went without a hitch thanks to Renee’s flawless coordination. She allowed us to be fully present and focus on our big day, never once making it feel like she took over or intervened too much. Her balance of professionalism and discretion was exactly what we needed. From the planning phase through the last dance, she kept everything organized and stress-free. Vendors were managed seamlessly, the schedule ran perfectly on time, and any small hiccups were handled quietly before we even noticed. Guests kept commenting on how smooth everything felt, which is all thanks to her.
