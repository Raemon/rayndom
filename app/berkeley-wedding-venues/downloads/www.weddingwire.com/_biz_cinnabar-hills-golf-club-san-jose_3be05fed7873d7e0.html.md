Awesome wedding venue!!

We were supposed to have our wedding at Cinnabar in September, 2020, which of course had to be canceled due to COVID! So, we contacted Cinnabar to move it back a year to 2021 and they were extremely accommodating. Unfortunately, the wedding in 2021 got canceled due to the delta variant. So then we decided to cancel our wedding altogether and just make it a smaller anniversary celebration of our February 2020 wedding in India (which thankfully happened before COVID started). Cinnabar was extremely supportive throughout all these decision changes. Finally, our anniversary celebration took place last week (Feb, 2022) and it couldn't have gone better!! Bella and Kristy were amazing! They made sure everything was set up the way we wanted it to be.   
  
For us, what made Cinnabar stand out from the other venues we visited were...  
  
1) Beautiful location- the drive up to the golf course is sooo extremely scenic and of course the venue is really really pretty.   
  
2) Beautiful reception hall- I mean the reception hall looks beautiful without any decorations, just as is! It is surrounded on two sides with glass doors and windows, which look out to the lush and undulating golf course!   
  
3) Awesome food- the food at Cinnabar is awesome! They have a restaurant onsite for the golf course and we ate there when we went to the venue for the first time. So we knew right off the bat that their food would be good. They do require that the food be catered by them. But trust me, that's a great thing! Our guests were soo happy with the food. When we went for the tasting before our event, we were so happy with all the food that instead of choosing three appetizers from the four we tasted, we decided to keep all four. Same was true for the entrees. We tasted three and were supposed to choose two. Instead we kept all three!   
  
4) Bella and Kristy- awesome event coordinators. They made sure everything was seamless. We didn't have to worry about anything! They helped us choose the really beautiful linens, chargers and napkins. We had wanted blush table cloths with gold napkins. Bella suggested that we change to ivory napkins instead. That was a great choice, because the gold napkins wouldn't look good. Also, they were extremely helpful with our desserts, which were catered by an outside vendor. They made sure the desserts were kept in the fridge and brought them out at the right time to be served to the guests!   
  
5) Bar- there's a bar in the reception hall and we chose to go for the pay by consumption option. So our guests got whatever it is that they wanted, which was great!   
  
All in all, this wedding (rather anniversary) venue was just perfect! This is probably one of the best venues in the bay area as far as value for money is concerned.

Excellent!

Cinnabar Hills made every so easy for us.   
  
Their event coordinators Kendra and Briana are very friendly and incredibly helpful. They made this amazingly stress free. They set up everything perfectly for us and made sure everything was exactly how we requested.   
  
The food was excellent and the setting was beautiful. We can’t recommend them enough!

Highly recommend for an inclusive, reasonably priced, and beautiful venue!

When we first stepped into Cinnabar we immediately fell in love with all the large windows, large open space, tons of light in the ballroom, the beautiful large wooden bar, and the outside patio space with beautiful flowers and lush lawns. This was the 5th venue we looked at and by then we had a pretty good grasp on our budget and what we were looking for - Cinnabar Hills ticked every box. Their off season package for 2018 included the room rental, cake, cake stand, cake knife, appetizers, seated entrées, hosted well liquor bar, coffee & water stations, linens, and basic chairs (which I upgraded to chiavari for not too large of a cost), all for less than $100/person.   
  
We worked with two event coordinators and both were great, very responsive, and very knowledgeable about anything we asked with a total ‘get it done’ attitude. Kendra Worthington ended up being the event coordinator for the day of our wedding and she was fabulous. She remembered everything from all my numerous emails and our two in-person meetings, and all was executed to perfection. She was accommodating to all requests I made and I felt anything (within reason) that I asked for wasn’t going to be a nickel-and-dimed extra cost but was just done.  
  
At our tasting we were able to finalize many of the details in the wedding. Much to our surprise, the day of our wedding the food was vastly better than what we tasted. So many people came up to us during the event to say how good their meal was.  
  
Setup for our wedding was a breeze, we were able to drop it all off two days before and the team at Cinnabar set everything up. Setup for the band was just as easy as they were given access as early as the day before to get everything situated.   
  
Cinnabar Hills made our wedding day stress-free and allowed us to focus on just having a great time. We highly recommend Cinnabar Hills Golf Club to anyone looking for an all-inclusive, reasonably priced, and beautiful venue.

I got married at Cinnabar a couple of weeks ago, and I couldn't have asked for a more perfect day! The venue is absolutely beautiful! The coordinators at Cinnabar take care of everything for you the day-of, and were extremely helpful in planning the event. Cinnabar was a lot more affordable than other venues I looked at in the Bay Area, and was worth every penny! My husband and I had so much fun, and would definitely recommend this venue to any bride!

This wedding venue was absolutely perfect for us and Charlene and Taylor were the best!! They were super responsive, patient, accommodating, and organized.  
  
Here are all the reasons why Cinnabar was amazing:  
\- outdoor ceremony with a natural arbor with flowers (i.e. save on flowers/ceremony setup)  
\- half outdoor/half indoor cocktail reception for maximum flexibility and ability to bask in/hide from the weather  
\- indoor reception for hiding from the elements and a nice clean indoor bathroom  
\- the food really blew our mind! They have whole cuts for filet mignon cooked nicely to a medium rare  
\- super super competitive pricing  
\- remote as it's nestled in the hills but not so remote that guests have to drive hours to get to your wedding  
\- you have the whole day to set up! (Slash they actually set it up for you)  
\- flexibility for DIY things (we made our own centerpieces!)  
\- large enough ~200 people and a sizable dance floor for alllllll the dancing!!  
\- the venue itself is gorgeous and well maintained  
\- all of their recommended vendors that we used were amazing and had affordably competitive pricing   
\- most of all, having organized coordinators (Charlene and Taylor) can really ease all the pain and stress of wedding planning. On the day of, I was the most chill bride ever thanks to Charlene and Taylor!

I had a wonderful experience with Cinnabar Hills Golf Club! It was a pleasure working with Kim and Charlene. They are super friendly, responsive, organized, flexible, and wonderful all around. I cannot thank them enough for all their help leading up to the wedding as well as on the day of the wedding. They gave a lot of advice for the wedding, and they have been extremely patient and understanding with any changes I made.   
  
The venue has gorgeous rolling hills in the background and beautiful flowers planted in the outdoor ceremony. Tip: fresh flowers are planted after Easter (at least this year). The reception area has some nice natural lighting. The food is delicious, and the prices are very reasonable. I am so happy I had my wedding at Cinnabar Hills Golf Club!

I absolutely love the venue and their staff! I only had 3 months to plan my wedding and had to work off of a strict budget. Fortunately, the date I picked (February) was during off-peak season time so I was able to book the venue at an off-peak rate. The venue is beautiful, surrounded by fields of green and secluded so that there isn't any distracting traffic. Parking is terrific too. The venue is surrounded by windows so you can see the beautiful landscape and appreciate the natural lighting. I loved how I could have the ceremony and reception both in one place. The ceremony area is outdoor, but only a step away from the reception area. It has a beautiful arch over the altar, surrounded by roses.   
  
Booking with Cinnabar made it so easy for me to pull off a 3 month planning wedding. The package included catering, waiting staff, bar staff, open bar, cake, tables, linens, chiavari chairs, and best of all, 2 event coordinators that I adore. Kim and Charlene, the event coordinators were very helpful and responsive throughout my planning process. I always felt like I was in good hands due to their attentiveness and never felt the need to hire a day-of coordinator. I didn't have a wedding planner either, so I planned the entire event myself. I had a specific vision in mind and presented it to Kim and Charlene in a 46 page PowerPoint deck so I wouldn't have to worry about the decorations or the schedule on the day of the wedding. They executed my plans flawlessly. Everything was perfect, down to the last detail. From the decorations, to the minute-by-minute schedule, everything was followed just as how I had asked. A few of my guests even told me that it was the best wedding they ever went to! They said the food was delicious, which I can attest to cause my husband and I actually ate our entire meals during the reception! The bar was fully staffed with 4 bartenders and my guests loved them. Everything was perfect about my wedding because of the venue and staff!

My Fiance and I are very pleased with the services we have been getting from Cinnabar, they are great with working with our schedules (since we are coming from a few hours away). When walking into this place, it was great, we were greeted amazingly, and not everything was about money. I love the employees and the range of different packages Cinnabar has to offer! Now just counting down the days until the wedding, and we can't wait.

We had our reception at Cinnabar Hills and it was amazing. Our wedding was on the large side (250 guests) and Cinnabar was able to accommodate easily. We heard that the bar got a little crowded during cocktail hour but all of our guests were still able to get drinks after a short wait. The day was a little warm but the outside patio area was in shade and stayed cool.  
  
We went with a lot of appetizers, steak and fish for the entree, and a bunch of mini desserts through Cinnabar. All of the food was delicious. Given the size of the wedding, the staff did a great job getting food out to all of the tables. Especially with appetizers during cocktail hour, we didn’t have any issues in terms of our guests being hungry/waiting for food.   
  
Aside from giving our guests the options of food, there wasn’t much customization beyond the choice of entree (i.e. each guest couldn’t ask for his/her steak a particular way). We had one guest where we asked for no nuts on the salad, but it still came out with pecans on it.  
  
We went with some of Cinnabar Hills’ preferred vendors for music and the cake. This made working with them really streamlined as they were already very familiar with the venue and the staff. Also, the pricing was quite competitive with these vendors.  
  
Kim is on top of things and she will have your back the day of the wedding. She makes sure you eat, makes sure people don’t pull you in different directions, and handles all the coordination between the vendors. This was huge as it let us just enjoy the day. When we showed up at the venue, everyone was busy, but nothing was hectic. That was great to see everything come together.

Fun place to have your ceremony and reception. The ceremony area and reception locations are right next to each other. Makes it very easy for guests. We've worked with Kim for many years and she does make the day of experience even more fun - And she has a great sense of humor (which is needed from time to time). :)

Cinnabar continues to be one of my favorite venues! Everything is laid out beautifully and the added cherry on top is their coordinator Kim! She is a love !!!
