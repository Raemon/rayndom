Steve was great and knowledgeable when helping to create our perfect ceremony, he had helpful ideas when we were stuck, he gave great advise, he was beyond professional. Our officiant Danielle, well there are no words to describe how happy I was with her, she bought and air of charm and wit. Danielle was patient, she went above and beyond, she made everything come together. I would definitely recommend them.

Steve was such a pleasure to work with! Coming from out of state, he made the process very easy. With a detailed Zoom call and a *very* detailed guide, we created the perfect ceremony just for us! Meeting him in person was wonderful, he made the entire process very straightforward and easy and gave us nothing to worry about. We could not recommend him enough!

Great Choice! 

Thank you so much for being such an incredible officiant at our wedding! Your warmth, professionalism, and heartfelt words made our ceremony truly unforgettable. You captured our story perfectly, and so many of our guests commented on how personal and touching the ceremony was. We couldn’t have imagined a more beautiful way to start our married life together. Thank you for making our day so special! - Boyuan and Shiqi

Awesome experience!

Me and my wife had an elopement ceremony organized by Officially Yours in September of 2024. Steve is a true professional, who is very helping and considerate. He customized the ceremony based on our needs and preferences, guiding and assuring us through the process. He also responded on texts and emails in timely manner which eliminated any stress we had. I would totally recommend Officially Yours to my friends!

Need a Jedi Master as your officiant? ;)

We had a Star Wars-themed wedding on May 4, and boy were we glad we went with Officially Yours!! Steve made the entire process pain-free and stress-free, listened to and navigated our requests and quirks perfectly, and even gave us really helpful tips. A month before our big day, he passed the reins to Brad, our actual officiant for the day.   
  
Brad was super fun to work with, and while he could've shown up at our wedding rehearsal (for an extra fee, of course!), he explained the process to us so well that we were confident in running through the entire rehearsal without him present. And on our wedding day, he arrived early like he promised, checked in on us, and slipped into his Jedi Master costume, and officiated our wedding like the Master he is!   
  
If you're ready to have rock star wedding ceremony, look no further than Officially Yours!!, you won't regret it!

Five stars!

Steve was fantastic to work with from start to finish. He got to know us and personalized our light hearted ceremony well. He played off the crowd, and we got many compliments after. The ceremony was a perfect length, not too short but didn’t drag on. I would highly recommend Steve to anyone who is looking for an officiant!

Beautiful wedding ceremony!

My husband & I got married in April and we absolutely loved our officiant Brad. Not only was his ceremony beautifully spoken but he had such a natural comedic and fun expression. We couldn't have been happier!

Review for Konrad and Steve Siglin

We recently got married on February 17th, 2024, and we couldn't be happier with the officiant services provided by Steve Siglin (Owner) and Officially Yours Officiants. From the moment we reached out to them, they were incredibly responsive and attentive to our vision for the ceremony.  
  
We requested that our ceremony be romantic and serious, yet still light and fun, and they absolutely nailed it. Our officiant, Konrad, delivered a heartfelt and memorable ceremony that resonated with both us and our guests. Many of our friends and family members commented specifically on how much they enjoyed what he had to say.  
  
In fact, one of my close friends who is getting married in May was so impressed that they asked for our Officiant: Konrad's phone number, and I will definitely be referring them to Officially Yours Officiants.  
  
Overall, we couldn't have asked for a better officiant experience. Steve Siglin and Officially Yours Officiants truly made our special day even more magical, and we are forever grateful. Highly recommended!

Outstanding Officiant Services! 

If you are looking for a great officiant tailored exactly to your wants and needs for the vision of your ceremony then go with Officially Yours! They were amazing from start to finish to help us envision our ceremony. We were lucky enough to have Louis as our officiant day of and when I tell you our guests RAVED about him and our ceremony, I mean it. We could not hear enough about him from our family and guests during and after our wedding day. I think sometimes the officiant gets overlooked, but is such a big part of your special day so it was so awesome to hear people come up to us and say how amazing Louis was and even ask if we had known him for years! I felt so at ease knowing they had our ceremony handled after our meeting with Steve where he got to know us and asked lots of questions about us and how we wanted our ceremony to go. The best part is that it was not word-for-word what we wanted. We gave him a general idea and some specifics of what we HAD TO HAVE in our ceremony and then they came up with it, which I loved because I was also experiencing it for the first time with my husband and we could see through their eyes how they saw us on our wedding and our relationship they had got to know during our meetings. That is how you know you had a great officiant- Louis took what they thought we wanted and needed and made it his own and it came across perfectly. He also made sure to speak to us before the ceremony and was always in contact with someone at the venue prior to the ceremony to make sure we had everything in place. They also take your marriage certificate after the ceremony and get it mailed off for filing so no deadlines are missed. I was able to reach out to Steve the owner for anything the whole way through and he was so responsive over the phone and email. I think this long review shows how much we loved working with Officially Yours! Highly recommend!!

We had such a great experience!

We met with the owner Steve to go over our all of vow selections & how the ceremony would go. He even advised us on the process of applying for the marriage license! Brad was our officiant for the day of & we were able to meet with him via zoom a few days prior to go over all the ceremony again. One thing he advised us on was to "Remember nothing!" for the big day & it was the best advice -- both he & the rest of our vendors walked us through the day stress-free! Brad is very kind & funny, many of our guests had told us how much they liked him too!!
