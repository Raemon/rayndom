Jessica was our saving grace. Originally, we didn’t have anyone to help us clean up and with about a month out of the wedding, I decided that I wanted one less thing on my family’s plate to stress about the night of the wedding. Jessica was prompt, thorough and a great communicator. Quite honestly, I didn’t even see her putting things away at the venue but she neatly packaged up everything I’d asked of her and even stayed a bit longer than expected to do so which was greatly appreciated. She charges a very reasonable rate and I would highly recommend her to any brides needing help with set up or take down / clean up for your wedding day.

I needed help with a surprise proposal for my girlfriend while on a anniversary trip to Sheboygan and luckily stumbled upon Always Magnolia! Right away Jori did an amazing job with helping me find a location that suited our needs, planning/designing the space and then setting everything up and taking it down afterwards! The entire time Jori was very quick to respond and super quick to adjust to any surprise changes I'd throw her way! The amount of stress and anxiety Jori lifted off my shoulders with her assistance let me focus on all the fun parts of planning and created such an amazing memory for me and my fiancée!

A tremendous thank you to the OSO IN LOVE team! We planned our wedding from across the country, but with guidance from the OSO team, it did not feel like we missed out on anything. Rob recommended amazing vendors that were talented, available, within our budget, and inclusive. That saved us so much research time, and we could book other vendors with confidence. Additionally, Rob did a fantastic job with designs and decorations. We had an idea of the vibe of our wedding, and Rob turned those aesthetic aspirations into a concrete vision. Our wedding was beautiful and exactly as we wanted!!! Lastly, while we were initially surprised to learn that Rob would not be at our wedding, our day-of coordinator Sarah was such a joy to work with. She led our dinner rehearsal and ensured that everything went smoothly on our wedding day. She GOT THINGS DONE!! Our wedding day was truly magical, and we couldn’t have done it without Rob and Sarah.

I had the pleasure to meet Ashley Schroeder this weekend . She assisted with both the rehearsal dinner preparation party and wedding of my best friends daughter. Ashley was so organized and prepared for both days. She knew every detail and had everybody where they needed to be. Everything ran so smoothly throughout the wedding day. She was by the mother of the brides side throughout the whole day and put my best friend at ease. If anything came up that needed to be addressed Ashley took care of it immediately. She was such a pleasure to have there and be visible if you needed her. I would strongly recommend Ashley if you are looking for a wedding coordinator/planner. You will not be disappointed. She will definitely take all the stress out of your day so you can enjoy every minute of your special day without worrying.

There are not enough words to explain how WONDERFUL Wendi is! She is everything you need in a coordinator and more. Her willingness to work with us on all our dreams leading up to the day was unparalleled and made our wedding the best weekend ever. She also handled our day from beginning to end no matter what. Any small thing that went wrong or needed attention she was at the ready to help! Could not have had what many of our guests called 'the best wedding ever' without her!

Alliey and team are the best in the business! She truly takes the time to listen to your vision and makes it come to life better than imagined. Being from out of town she made the process a breeze. She was accommodating and always made time when I was in the area. In addition to her skills, she has an amazing network of top notch vendors. She is well respected by them and they all told us rave reviews about her. You are definitely in the best hands when you are with Sash & Bow. Highly recommend her for all of your wedding needs, you won't regret it!

We had a wonderful experience working with Perfect Day for our wedding. Amy and Ashley were incredible, so organised and thoughtful. Their attention to detail gave us complete peace of mind throughout the entire process. They did a fantastic job managing our vendors and asked all the right questions, including things we would never even have thought about. Everything on the day ran flawlessly. Amy quite literally saved my dress by recommending someone who fixed it at the very last minute! We are so grateful for all the care and effort that went into making our day perfect. We couldn’t recommend Perfect Day more highly.

Jessica was absolutely amazing to work with! From our very first phone call, I immediately felt confident that I was in good hands. She kept me organized and on track with everything leading up to the wedding, and on the day of, she went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly. She was constantly one step ahead—running around to grab things I needed and making sure the whole day flowed perfectly. I truly believe the reason I felt so calm the morning of my wedding was because I knew Jessica had everything under control. I can’t recommend her enough—she was such a key part of making our day so beautiful and perfect!

If I could give Chloe 6 stars I would. She executed our wedding flawlessly at the Pfister on 10.25.25. Chloe is incredibly detail oriented, organized, so calm and relaxed, and a true professional. I was a type A bride, and she was so helpful with every question I had and every clarification I needed. She was so hands on with my venue coordinator and vendors and truly brought my vision to life. From ensuring my husband and I didn’t see each other before the ceremony, to lining up my bridal party, lighting last minute candles and ensuring the vendors had everything the needed, she went above and beyond. Truly very talented at her job and you will so happy to have her on your day.
