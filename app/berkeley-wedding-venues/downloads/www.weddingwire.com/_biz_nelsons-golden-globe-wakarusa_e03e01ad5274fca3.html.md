The staff at Nelson's was extremely helpful in planning our reception for 250 people. The food was wonderful, and they did just what they promised to do. :)

Nelson's was wonderful to work with! They were super flexible and sense there was nothing book for the Friday before the wedding, they even let us into the venue to decorate at no extra charge. The food was great and they even sent home the left overs!

First of all - Nelson's Chicken is DELICIOUS.   
  
But the service and prices can't be beat. The servers at my event were quick and quiet, and kept the room clean. They packaged up my leftovers and tided everything up. They also brought their own table skirts so I didn't have to provide linens.  
  
Before the services, they were responsive and courteous.   
  
We got the $10.99/person service, which for a buffett, really can't be beat. And everyone loved the food.

Nelson's Catering was absolutely great at working with everything we wanted and adjusting to specialize for our wedding. The banquet set up was beautiful and very timely. Follow through was exactly how they had said it would be. Great service. Only thing was at the end of the night we had ran out of cooked vegetable on buffet after everyone had been through it at least once and some multiple times. We had 265 guests. I highly recommend. Great food. Great price.

We got married in culver Indiana and catering options were limited. We had Nelsons cater our rehearsal dinner and reception. We had the normal port a pit chicken for the rehearsal (phenomenal) and used their fancier elegance in thyme menu for the reception. Yvonne is so great and accommodating. Great people to work with, great food!
