## About

Please visit us at: http://ccctiburon.net/facility/weddings

Imagine your wedding in the scenic rolling hills of Tiburon, California with the breathtaking panorama of San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge and Mt. Tamalpais. We have a spectacular space here at CCC, which we enjoy sharing with the wider community.

Your guests may enjoy a stroll through spacious gardens and our labyrinth. If you choose CCC, you can return to our park-like setting in years to come, and reflect on the special day that began your married life, surrounded by the beauty and peace of our idyllic site.

For a more intimate wedding, we suggest our Seminar Room with its warm wood tones, open-beamed ceiling, fireplace, and windows overlooking the garden and Bay. Many have remarked about the particularly sacred quality they feel when they enter this space.

The Sanctuary can be ideal for the months when an outdoor wedding is not as comfortable, or if you prefer more of a church setting. The open sanctuary with high ceilings and views of the garden and bay, along with our cozy fireside space can also be transformed into a breathtaking reception space. Although the maximum capacity for outdoor ceremonies is 150 people, CCC must limit indoor, seated receptions to 100 people. 

For those who desire a one-stop-shop, all-Inclusive wedding packages are available starting at $14,200 for 100 people. The package includes our breath-taking site, catering, linens, tableware, wedding cake, flowers, and photography. CCC partners with some of the Bay Area's most talented special event vendors to create the perfect backdrop for your reception. 

CCC allows beer, wine, and champagne to be served by licensed bartenders.

We utilized their outdoor venue and it was absolutely breathtaking. Debi, the onsite wedding coordinator was professional and extremely helpful. Highly recommend this venue.
