I worked with Kenny at the Center for History in South Bend for our wedding ceremony venue. I have loved this location and knew I wanted to be married here one day. I got married in June, the flowers and gardens looked wonderful! Kenny was very easy to work with, we communicated mainly via email and a few meetings. I would highly recommend CFH!

The History Center in Fort Wayne IN was one of the best places for your wedding. Not only is Steve wonderful to work with but the location is just beautiful any time of year, right in the heart of Fort Wayne. You get so much value for the location and the option to use the outside court yard. Steve had great referrals for anything we needed. We didn't use to many be he always had answers. It does take a little bit to get a email back but he always does. The only down side is the very small kitchen space, so choose a caterer wisely and I wish the security, you have to have if your servicing alcohol, didn't look like he just got off an all night binder.
