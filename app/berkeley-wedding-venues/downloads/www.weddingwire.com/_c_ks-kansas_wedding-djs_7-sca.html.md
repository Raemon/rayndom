The DJ was great! The app he had for us to use during the planning process was easy to use and a nice way to get the songs we wanted. He was always nice to talk with when we would meet with him or through email. He was very on top of things and always knew what we needed. My Matron of honor even mentioned how good he was and how he was good at keeping the reception /party moving. He played lots of fun songs and had lots of guests moving and grooving! The only complaint I heard was that people wish he would have sprinkled in a few slow songs. I would use him again!

Larry did a fantastic job at our July wedding. From start to finish, he was professional, calm, and incredibly easy to work with. Communication was always clear and quick, and he was completely attentive to our wishes, which made the entire experience stress-free and enjoyable. Larry knew exactly how to read the crowd and keep the energy up—the dance floor was never empty! He kept the night flowing smoothly, helped us stay on track with our timeline, and did a fantastic job emceeing the event. His ability to keep everything organized while still making the night fun truly stood out. Larry went above and beyond to make our wedding unforgettable. Everyone had an amazing time, and we received so many compliments about the music and atmosphere. I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking for a DJ who truly knows how to keep the party alive.

We hired photography, videography and DJ services for our wedding and all 3 individuals knocked it out of the park! Everyone was so communicative and really listened to what our vision was while still putting their own personal stylistic touch into it. I could not have asked for a better team.

Dan was our DJ for our wedding on 9/13/25. He met with us a week before, and wrote down every detail of what we wanted for our big day. He even worked with me to surprise my husband with audio wedding vows. He kept the crowd entertained, and helped us find the best flow to keep the party alive. Our guests all loved him, and had nothing but good things to say about him. If we ever need DJ services again, we will be booking Vital Entertainment again. Thank you Dan!

I hired HiFi for my son's wedding in September 2024. I did my research and interviewed several companies before going with Dave Damn. We also used his services of the photo booth, dry sparklers and his DJ services. Dave had communication with myself and my son about all details. He was nothing less that fabulous through the whole journey. Every details was exactly how we wanted and he held the party of 270 in constant fun throughout the entire night. Hands down the BEST!

We booked Wing Productions for both DJ and photo booth at our wedding, and we’re genuinely so glad we did. The DJ kept the whole night moving. He handled the ceremony audio, announcements, first dances, and all the transitions with zero hiccups, and once the dancing started the floor was packed for hours. Guests kept telling us how good the DJ was, which I feel like never happens unless someone’s really on point. The photo booth was a huge hit too. We originally added it because we thought it would be a fun extra, but it ended up being one of the things people talked about most. The props were great, the lighting made everyone look good, and the prints came out fast. We got a digital gallery afterward which is hilarious to look back through. Overall, they made the night way easier for us and way more fun for everyone else. If you’re on the fence, just book them. It’s worth it.

We could not have asked for a better wedding team! Tara and Ally were absolutely incredible from start to finish. Tara made sure our venue was set up perfectly — every detail exactly how we envisioned it. Ally handled all the day-of logistics flawlessly and kept everything running smoothly. Our families even made a point to tell us how impressed they were with both of them! Our DJ, April, was phenomenal. She kept the energy high, the music flowing, and the dance floor full all night. She created the perfect vibe and truly kept the party going. Everyone had the best time! And our photographer, Kim… WOW. She went above and beyond in every possible way. Not only are the teaser photos already breathtaking, but she also helped far more then we ever expected — fluffing my dress, placing my veil, bustling my gown, curling my daughter’s hair, helping with jewelry, making sure we always had drinks, and even carrying my food. She was incredibly efficient, quick, organized, wasted no time, and still got every shot we wanted without making anything feel rushed. We will absolutely be hiring Kim again for future photo shoots. This entire team made our day stress-free, beautiful, and unforgettable. We are so grateful for every one of them. Highly, highly recommend!

Absoutley love our pictures. The dj service was also top notch. They took care of pictures and so much more. They helped move things along and keep the day moving smoothly. I didn't hire a consultant or anyone for that as I was told up from it was my day and after talking about a schedule of events they kind of ran the show, exactly how we wanted it. Even with setup the morning of, I had no stress for the whole day. That is a great wedding if you ask me.
