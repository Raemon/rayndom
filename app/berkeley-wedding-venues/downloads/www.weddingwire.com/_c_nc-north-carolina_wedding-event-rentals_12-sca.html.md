Planning a wedding from out of state can be overwhelming, but working with Metro made the entire process incredibly easy. From the very beginning, their communication and organization gave us complete peace of mind and made planning from afar feel seamless. On the wedding day, their setup and breakdown crew didn’t miss a beat. They were professional, efficient, and completely on top of every detail. Everything was set up perfectly and taken down just as smoothly, allowing us to truly relax and enjoy the day. We’re so grateful for their hard work and would absolutely recommend Metro to anyone looking for a reliable, professional rental team.

Stevie and her team at Save the Date OBX are the real deal. While we technically hired her for day-of coordination, she went above and beyond from day one and leading up to the big day. Stevie is kind, down-to-earth, and incredibly savvy, bringing years of Outer Banks event experience that ensured our planning was stress-free and our day was executed perfectly. She is someone you can wholeheartedly trust with your big day—communicative, professional, and deeply reliable. We honestly don't know how we would have pulled off such a seamless, beautiful wedding without her guidance. In fact, we miss chatting with her daily! You will not regret having Stevie in your corner.

These oversized games were the perfect addition to our cocktail hour! Ian was very helpful identifying the best games to rent. They were very quick to respond to any question I had regarding day of set up. They were on time and professional when it came time for the big day. Our guests even commented on how cool it was to have the option to play these games throughout the evening. We are so glad we chose to have Rustic Charm be a part of our wedding day!

Marsh rentals came in clutch on short notice. They delivered and installed a beautiful backdrop and chargers for our tables. Not to mention they are a very nice couple. Easy to communicate with for needs and changes.

We hired Bartenders Plus for our event, and they absolutely crushed it! From the first consultation to the final pour, their team was professional, polished, and genuinely fun to work with. Our guests couldn’t stop raving about the signature cocktails and how seamless the bar service was throughout the night. The bartenders were not only skilled but brought an incredible energy that elevated the entire vibe. Everything ran like clockwork—setup, service, cleanup—zero stress on our end. It honestly felt like they were an extension of our team. If you’re looking for bartenders who know how to keep the drinks flowing and the party going—without ever missing a beat—Bartenders Plus is it. Highly recommend. Will 100% book again!

We had such a great experience working with The Festive Elk for our wedding this November! The team was incredibly helpful and responsive leading up to our wedding as we decided what rentals we were interested in and with any changes we needed to make as we finalized details. The drop-off and pick-off process was very easy and I was SO pleased with the quality of everything on our wedding day. I would absolutely recommend them to anyone.

We rented table linens from A Special Event rental Company in Fuquay NC. The owner Andy took care of us himself and was very helpfull. The linens looked great and were exactly what we wanted.
