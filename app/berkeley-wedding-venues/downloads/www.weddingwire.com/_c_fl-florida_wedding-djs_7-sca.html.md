Truly a one of a kind experience! DJ Pav was communicative throughout the whole process, from the initial consultation, through the event and even after to make sure we were satisfied with his services! He made sure everything went seamlessly and his music is on point! Special effects were also such an amazing touch that helped make our event really stand out! Cannot recommend DJ Pav enough!

Ray Costa and his band we're an amazing part to our wedding. Ray knew exactly what songs to play to keep the dance floor alive and honored our requests perfectly. Adding in his band members made it feel like a live performance which made the dancing hours fly by. My wife and I could not recommend Ray Costa any more. He was amazing and we will forever be grateful for his presence on the dance floor. Hire Ray and his team for your wedding or event - you will not regret it!

Jeff and White Rose Entertainment were absolutely incredible! Jeff was our wedding DJ, and he made an already perfect day even better. He was easy to work with, incredibly professional, and executed everything flawlessly. The visual enhancements were a total game changer. The upgrades are completely worth it. Jeff took the time to understand our style beforehand, and on the big day he completely nailed the vibe. The dance floor was packed all night with nonstop energy. There never was a moment where the energy lulled on the dance floor. Jeff was like a mind reader and knew what our guests were hoping to hear. If you want an amazing DJ who knows how to keep the party going, look no further than Jeff and White Rose Entertainment! You'll have the time of your life and your guests will talk about the entertainment for a while!

We worked with Grant Hemmond DJs for our wedding this past weekend! Their team was incredible to work with from the start - very responsive, flexible in changing things (even last minute), and all very kind! We specifically got to work with Aaron Payne as our DJ and MC! He was so nice and seemed very excited for our event. We had a facetime call prior to make sure we were doing everything we wanted and he was super responsive with all my questions. He did a great job with the music, reading the crowds vibe, helping us stay on schedule, etc. Can’t recommend Grant Hemmond enough! thank you!

We couldn't have asked for a better experience with Soundwave Entertainment from start to finish! Wendy was absolutely amazing - she coordinated everything seamlessly, worked closely with us throughout the planning process, and was incredibly responsive and helpful every step of the way. DJ Ray Vales was outstanding! He kept the energy high all night, played the perfect mix of music, and really read the crowd. We received so many compliments on how great he was from our guests, and the dance floor was truly packed all night. We could not recommend Soundwave more, they truly made our wedding unforgettable!!

The one thing I was so particular about for my wedding was the DJ. The quality of entertainment can truly make or break a wedding. Jay was responsive and understanding before the wedding and had resolved issues before we were even aware of the possibility of there being a problem. He was personable and kind to our guests, extremely well communicated, and made sure every one of our guests had a good time ranging from ages 2 to 82. Seriously, I could not recommend Jay’s services enough and cannot say enough kind words. Thank you

EddieB and DJ Elow went above and beyond for our wedding! We had the steel brass drums at cocktail hour and DJ and lighting at the reception. I told Chris our vibe with big band and old school rat pack music and then 90s throwbacks. This team is outstanding and would recommend over and over.

Vision is the best!! I cannot express how great my experience was with this team. We had Mike as our DJ and he was absolutely amazing at keeping the fun alive all night at our wedding. We were having so much fun, that Mike was kind enough to extend our party for an extra half hour, and we are so grateful to him for that. Jorge, the owner of Vision, was so wonderful to work with. He was extremely responsive and answered all emails and phone calls very promptly. He is an expert in his role. A few weeks before our event, Jorge, Leo, and Mike met me at the venue for a walkthrough to make sure we had the correct amount of speakers and uplights for our huge blank-canvas of a space. Everything turned out perfect, so we are very grateful to the team for helping our ~vision~ come to life. Aside from the DJ services and lighting, we also used Vision for their Glam Photo Booth. I am SO happy that we made this decision. I have never seen a photo booth with clearer photos, fun props, and excellent service. Thank you Vision for everything!!
