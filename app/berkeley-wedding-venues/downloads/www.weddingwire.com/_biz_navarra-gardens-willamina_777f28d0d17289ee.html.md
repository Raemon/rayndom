It really was perfect!

I fell in love with the setting and the large spacious oak tree grove, the river, plus all the beautiful garden areas--words do not do it justice. Karen, the owner, was knowledgeable, helpful, flexible, and clearly dedicated to what she does. The venue has several rental items onsite available, which made it less stress in having to bring as many things or finding rentals elsewhere. The planning process was easy to follow along and Karen was open to additional visits that helped me in preparing for our big day. The venue is also very open with your choice in vendors, which I found helpful compared to other venues we toured. I wouldn't have changed a thing and I'm grateful for Karen and her team and their hospitality. Their efforts really helped make our day just as I imagined it.

Everything You Could Ever Want

This is the perfect spot to get married. I could write a novel about why, but to keep your attention, I'll make a list of 10 reasons you should definitely book Navarra Gardens right away.   
1) The owner, Karen is a DREAM to work with, communicative, easy to coordinate with, and an all around cool person to get to know.   
2) It is affordable, reasonable, and no hidden fees   
3) There are places to stay the night; it was important to me to be able to wake up at my venue the day of my wedding and just be able to set up and get ready; my parents also got to stay as well, which worked out super well for us. Karen was even so AMAZING and checked with me to ensure I was okay with my parents staying there. So respectful and protective of me as the bride!  
4) There are no words to describe how beautiful the property is; the pictures could never do it justice. The English garden made it so I didn't have to do much with flowers or decorations in general. Even if you're on the fence, GO SEE THE PLACE. It's an experience in and of itself. For reference, I saw the place in the dead of winter and knew it was magical and perfect.   
5) The layout was so fun for guests of all ages. We had elderly people, disabled people, and kids of all ages and they all had a blast.   
6) Karen and the staff were so flexible and just wanted our day to feel special. They knew to work out logistics with our coordinator and family. If there was any crises, we had no idea! It was a drama free and relaxing day. So grateful for that as I know that is not the norm.   
7) Vendors knew exactly where to go, and where to set up. Everyone who worked with us said it was all straightforward and simple to work with Karen and her team.   
8) Parking, restrooms, and guest accommodations were excellent. People were welcome to keep their cars overnight as we had an open bar and told all our guests we wanted them to get a DD if they were having too much fun.  
9) There are so many places to explore on the property; perfect nooks for more introverted guests to get away to and lawn chairs by the river to lounge at. My husband and I definitely took advantage of hiding away by the river while everything was buzzing around us.   
10) NO mosquitos or bugs to fight off. You may be wondering how that was possible in August by a river in Oregon- but Karen has her ways. ;)   
  
Honestly, take the tour, see what she has to offer, and decide for yourself. But don't take too long to deliberate, from my experience, her schedule fills up quick!

Beautiful Venue and Lovely Host

Karen has created a gorgeous venue right on the Yamhill River with an amazing garden, a breathtaking oak grove, and the option to use the indoor event space as well. We were able to spend the night on site, which made things so much easier. Karen and her team go above and beyond. I would absolutely recommend Navarra Gardens for any wedding or other large event.

Beautiful setting and great owner

I am a coordinator in the Willamette valley area. I had the privilege of doing another wedding at Navarra. Karen is a great venue owner and works hard to keep her couples happy and also be a good neighbor to her surrounding property owners. This venue is unique and beautiful.

Marie was the best! I chose Navarra Gardens for our venue for a few reasons…we wanted an outdoor wedding, and seriously her property is GORGEOUS! Right on the river with a huge very well maintained and manicured yard. Plenty of room for everyone! You can not beat the price; get the venue for the whole day, and tables and chairs included! There is not one thing I would of changed about the place. Marie was super accommodating and so calm, with Marie it’s all up to the bride, she truly does make the day a smooth one!

Navarra Gardens is THE place to get married!!! It is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen!!! I (the bride) was a bit nervous.. HAHA.. and stepping on to Navarra Gardens gave me such peace that the nerves just went away! Marie (owner of Navarra Gardens) is one of a kind! She is the definition of loving and generous! One of my bridesmaid just had a baby, the baby had fallen asleep during our loud reception; Marie took her into her own home to let her sleep.. THIS WAS NOT PART OF THE CONTRACT! She brought us warm, homemade cookies and coffee while the wedding party was getting ready! She is just simply AMAZING!! If you are getting married in Oregon, get married here!!!

Wonder-filled wedding

Our daughter, Sara, married her love, Logan, on August 17, 2024, at Navarra Gardens. We couldn't have asked for a more lovely venue and hostess (and crew) for a wedding. Within moments of stepping onto the grounds, we knew this was the venue for us. Navarra Gardens holds a magical charm that beckons its visitors to behold its beauty and be welcomed in by its bounty. We wanted Sara and Logan to begin their married journey here amongst this beauty.   
Karen was kind and exact in her communication with us through every step of the process.   
Even on a day when the weather was less than favorable (rain with a little thunder and maybe a strike of lightning), Navarra Gardens did not disappoint. Due to the weather, many changes were made and multiple options were provided. Karen and her crew went above and beyond to provide Sara and Logan and all our family and friends with an experience we will remember and cherish forever. Everywhere we looked Saturday afternoon and evening we saw faces filled with joy. Many guests stated this was the best wedding/reception they'd attended. It was a wonder-filled day. Thank you!
