We rented white umbrellas through Bailee at Decor on Tap, and they were perfect! They were surprisingly hard to track down, but she made it happen and handled everything seamlessly. She dropped them off and picked them up, which made things so easy for us. Bailee was so sweet and easy to work with, we’re so glad we found her!

Our experience with BMV was perfect! So easy to find things in catalog and order through Tessa. Communication with her was so easy, she got back to us, was helpful, and adapted well to changes. Delivery crew was great and on time. All the furniture was clean and looked amazing. Everyone from our wedding was so impressed, and loved the pieces. We had people taking pictures with the floral wall all night! I am so happy we did it and so happy with how it turned out!

The women at beyond elegance are fantastic. They are willing to send you out samples of their linens so you can pick exactly what you want. I didn't choose to order samples as my time was limited. The pictures on the website are true to color and valid. They also gave me advise on what matches and what will look good for my event, as i chose two different fabrics. You will not be disappointed coordinating colors for your event.

I was very impressed with the attention to detail and all the AMAZING decorations they have! They were so helpful and understanding even with all the changes I made and never made me feel bad about it. They exceeded every expectation I had!

We used Big Ten for ceremony chair rentals for our outdoor ceremony. From the initial quote to delivery and payment, they were very quick and courteous. Unlike their local competitors, they charged only one low fee for delivery and pick up (competitors charge both ways). They even delivered 2 days before the event (in a small trailer) and picked up 2 days after the event, so there was no rush to pick up or return. I would definitely use them again for rentals in the future.

Dubuque Photo Booth did an awesome job. They captured some wonderful pictures and everyone had a really great time with the photo booth. I highly recommend getting a photo booth and Dubuque Photo Booth was great!

Sara from Creative Wedding Services is amazing!! I was in a real jam after getting scammed by someone else on weddingbee.com- I needed to rent 75 chair covers and 75 sashes. I contacted her with only 11 days left before my wedding, and she still got everything to me 2 days before the wedding!! What a lifesaver!! The chair covers and sashes were the exact ivory and red colors that I wanted, and were folded and sealed separately in individual plastic bags. She sent me a packet of papers with all of the instructions I would need for the linens, as well as helpful tips and suggestions :) I rented them for 50 cents per chair cover, and 25 cents per sash!! Couldn't be happier and I will definitely be recommending her to all of my friends and family in the future :) Thanks Sara!!
