**Private Hudson Valley Estate | Full-Weekend Weddings | On-Site Lodging**  
  
Pine Brook Manor is a private Hudson Valley estate designed for couples who want a relaxed, full-weekend wedding with the ease of on-site accommodations and complete privacy. Located in Sparrow Bush, New York, less than two hours from New York City, the estate allows guests to arrive easily while still feeling fully immersed in a destination-style setting.

Set across 110 acres of historic grounds, forests, and water features, Pine Brook Manor blends pastoral character with modern comforts. Climate-controlled indoor event spaces and built-in inclement weather options ensure celebrations remain comfortable and seamless regardless of season or forecast.

Pine Brook Manor is ideal for couples seeking a true estate wedding experience where events unfold naturally across the weekend. From welcome gatherings to the ceremony, reception, and farewell brunch, the property is designed for thoughtful transitions, guest comfort, and a calm, unhurried pace.

**Facilities and Capacity**

Ceremonies may take place in the Forest Chapel, a serene woodland clearing surrounded by mature trees and seasonal greenery, with indoor alternatives available in the event of inclement weather. Following the ceremony, guests gather on the Grand Lawn, overlooking the Mill Pond, for cocktails and sunset views before transitioning indoors.

Receptions are hosted in Heritage Hall, a fully climate-controlled space featuring exposed beams, warm architectural details, and views of the surrounding landscape. Designed for comfort and flow, the hall offers ample room for dining, dancing, and celebration in every season. Hidden Brook provides an intimate indoor setting ideal for cocktail hours, late-night gatherings, welcome events, or relaxed pre-wedding celebrations.

**Services Offered**

Pine Brook Manor hosts only one wedding at a time, offering full estate buyouts so couples and their guests enjoy complete privacy and the estate’s full attention throughout the weekend. A single estate rental fee includes use of the property for both the ceremony and reception, allowing celebrations to flow seamlessly without separate venue charges.

On-site accommodations support a relaxed, immersive wedding weekend, giving couples and their closest guests space to gather, unwind, and celebrate together from arrival through farewell brunch. With a thoughtful, organized approach to hosting and close coordination with planners and vendors, Pine Brook Manor delivers a wedding experience that feels intentional, personal, and beautifully well run.

I can't say enough good things about this place! Lynn was amazing, so open to my ideas and willing to make them happen within my budget. She had supportive and creative feedback and it felt like every worry I had about our big day was taken care of and she made it happen. She was quick to respond to any concern I had and made the day all about us. Nothing seemed to phase her and it was an amazing feeling having her on my side. She must sleep with her phone because she always was available to talk to about the food, flowers, music... thoughts on seating and she made it all so easy for us. The Old Dutch farm is so beautiful and cozy...a true get away. The grounds were immaculate and looked just like the photos I had brought of my "dream venue." We were married under the grape arbor and had cocktails near the pool and it just felt magical. Exactly how I imagined my country fairy tale wedding, casual but elegant. Everyone commented on how truly special our wedding was and what an amazing time they had. Some of our guests are even going back for their own get away. I am so lucky to have found the Old Dutch Farm and Lynn and I had looked at a lot of places. This one stands out with their personal customer service and what I am sure will be award winning style. You will not be disappointed with this place and your wedding experience will be a spa day of ease and relaxation, knowing you have Lynn making it happen.
