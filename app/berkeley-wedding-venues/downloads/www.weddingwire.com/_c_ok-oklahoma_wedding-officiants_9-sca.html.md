Our wedding officient was the assistant minster from Kirk of the Hills (Jeff). He was FANTASTIC, and insisted on a short series of pre-marital counceling sessions before he would marry us. During those sessions, he gave us a frank assessment of what our strengths and weakness were as a couple, as well as effective ways to disagree. He did more than just marry us, he helped us start our lives together

As members of Church on the Move my new husband and I had the honor of having our wedding officiated by one of the Church on the Move pastors. We were blessed to have Pastor Scott Johnson do our couselling as well as our ceremony. He did a wonderful job, we could not have imagined any better. Our ceremony was PERFECT!

We had to move our location due to weather and Anna was quick to be on board and even had a secondary contingency plan if needed. She was great and we loved having her for our officiant! Definitely recommending this to anyone in the area getting married.
