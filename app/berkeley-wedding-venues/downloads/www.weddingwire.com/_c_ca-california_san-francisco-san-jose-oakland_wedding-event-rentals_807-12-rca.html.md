What are some typical wedding rentals?

__

Some wedding venues may include rentals like tables, chairs, china, etc. in their packages. However, some do not—or you may not love your venue’s offerings. In these cases, booking a wedding rental company is a must. Wedding rental companies tend to offer a wider selection of items so that you can find tables, chairs, linens, and more that fit your wedding theme and style. Of course, remember that renting high-end, specialty, or custom items for your wedding can add to your wedding rental costs. Some of the [items you will need for your wedding that can be rented](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-things-you-should-not-forget-to-rent) are:

  * Tables
  * Chairs
  * Dance floor
  * Linens (tablecloths, napkins, chair covers, etc.)
  * Drapery
  * Lighting
  * Furniture
  * Audio/visual equipment
  * Tents
  * Vases and other vessels
  * China
  * Barware
  * Flatware

How much does it cost to rent a wedding tent?

__

If you’re hosting a wedding in an outdoor space, [a tent may be a necessity](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/factors-to-consider-before-you-plan-a-tented-wedding) —both for your guests’ comfort and in case of inclement weather. There are many companies that specialize in tent rentals, and the average cost of a tent rental varies widely, but the average starting price for a tent rental in the U.S. is $300. You may also need to pay to reserve a tent in case of bad weather, even if you don’t end up using it. If you do use your rental, you’ll also have to pay for the labor to erect your wedding tent. There are numerous different types of tents to choose from, including clear-top tents, pole tents, marquee tents, and more, plus you may also need to rent utilities, such as generators, heating and cooling units, and even an outdoor catering kitchen, which can certainly add cost. You’ll want to work with your tent rental company to determine the best type of tent and any related utilities you will need for your special day. 

How much does it cost to rent a wedding altar?

__

Renting a special altar for your wedding can add a unique touch and personality to your ceremony, especially when it is decorated with flowers by your florist. Many wedding rental companies offer altars and arches, as well as chuppahs and mandaps. In the U.S., the average starting price for an altar or arch is $75. Work with your venue, florist, and rental company to determine if an altar or arch is something you’ll need for your ceremony, and how it can be decorated. 

How much does it cost to rent wedding reception tables?

__

There are a variety of different wedding reception tables to choose from, depending on your wedding style and the types of tables your venue can accommodate. While round tables are the most common, square and long rectangular tables are also (on-trend!) options. The average starting price for wedding reception tables in the U.S. is $8 per table. You’ll want to ensure you know the reception table shapes and styles you’ll be featuring at your wedding so you can [create an accurate seating chart](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-create-your-wedding-seating-chart) and plan your decor accordingly. 

How much does it cost to rent wedding chairs?

From standard folding chairs to elegant Chiavari chairs, modern ghost chairs, rustic cross-back chairs, and more, you have many options when it comes to wedding chairs, both from a style perspective and cost. In the U.S., the average starting price for wedding chair rentals is $2 per chair. While renting folding chairs can be a less expensive endeavor, you may also wish to rent chair covers to dress them up.

Fine Linen Creation are the true heroes who brought my vision of the wedding reception room to life. The transformation was absolutely stunning, and I couldn’t have asked for anything more perfect. Terri is the absolute best—her attention to detail and dedication to making everything perfect were evident in every aspect of the decor. Ruby was also incredibly helpful and ensured everything ran smoothly. The entire team went above and beyond to make our day special, and I cannot thank them enough. If you want a wedding that looks like a dream come true, I highly recommend Fine Linen Creation. They made our reception unforgettable, and we are so grateful for their amazing work.

Our experience with Event Magic was wonderful. We were able to get all of the linens and dishes we needed in order to make our dream wedding come to life. We turned our already gorgeous venue into a truly magical place for our ceremony, lunch, and reception. We had guests tell us our wedding was like a fairy tale wedding!

I only got a few items from Seventh Heaven to complete my wedding vision, but I drooled over their inventory. I wish I could have afforded to do my entire wedding with there pieces, but sadly it wasn't in the budget. The owner was always the most helpful and responsive with a can do happy to help attitude I greatly appreciated. If you can afford, I highly recommend going down to there warehouse and going on a shopping spree!

I was looking for something unusual that wouldn't end up in a drawer - something people would enjoy immediately. Living Intentions produces sprouted, organic, gluten-free, vegan, raw amazing foods - We used two of their Gone Nuts flavors - White Chocolate and Clusters of Cacao. They also outsourced raw, vegan chocolate truffles in beautiful decorative boxes. We placed the Gone Nuts in clear bags with ribbons and placed the truffles beside the bags with little cards describing the products. We received absolute "rave" reviews - AND...everyone could eat them! You've got to contact them for your special treats! Thank you Living Intentions. The Plummer Family

Solomon was so lovely to work with and communicative. I chose the option to have my golden wedding arch setup on site and then picked up the next day. Solomon was punctual, responsive, and made the process so easy and seamless. He worked closely with my florist for the arch setup as well. I would recommend him to anyone!

Nick is talented. Extremely talented. His hand-picked pieces have so many looks and styles you can mix and match. What’s even better is Nick’s eye for design. He gives great tips, ideas, and advice for any budget. My wedding was a dream and it wouldn’t have been possible without Nick. He went above and beyond to help me with some logistical challenges and really worked with me to make my event flawless. Anyone who’s reading this needs to at least consider his services or pieces. He’s professional and personable - and will work with you every step of the way. I loved working with him. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for being a star vendor. Will definitely consider him for any other events I have!!
