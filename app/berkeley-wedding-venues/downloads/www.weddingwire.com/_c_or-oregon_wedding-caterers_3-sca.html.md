I am a wedding planner and one of my couples had booked Cameron and his team for their wedding this year. During the planning process things started to get a bit rocky with the venue not pulling through, which made Morchella's position very acceptable to walk away due to the current circumstances...Speaking from a vendors side of things, the side that clients rarely see, their integrity to stick to their commitment to the client and provide a 5 star service regardless of the circumstances was unmatched. The food was outstanding and curated with thought and everyone left so happy! There were even a couple pivots we had to make in the day on the fly, which the team was was able to adapt to seamlessly. Everything interaction I had working with them was professional and held a "client-first" mentality. I would 10/10 recommend them again!

We got married on October 24th, 2025 and had Ristorante Di Pompello cater for us, and it was absolutely amazing! The process was extremely simple and straightforward. We did the tasting before we booked which was a lot of fun and helped us to determine which choices we wanted. Every single thing I have tasted from them is delicious! The contract is super easy to follow and the coordinator Heidi is very friendly and helpful when it comes to building your perfect menu. Such nice and professional people. I didn't have to worry about them on the day of the wedding, because they had everything handled, and it turned out so perfect. The buffet is so good and works well for many different pallets and dietary restrictions which I really appreciated as well. If you are looking for some super yummy Italian food for your wedding, I would hands-down go with them they are great!

Oh my gosh. Where do I begin. Branch Road Farm is an amazing group of catering fairies. They do it all: table setting (cutlery, plates, napkins, glasses), water service, coffee/tea, appetizers, CAKE baking, dinner, bartender and alcohol. The food was amazing (guests said so too!). Communication was amazing. I kept amending our service throughout the planing process and Branch Road farm was cool and collected and always said "we got you!". I cannot recommend their catering service enough. Thank you Branch Road! The food excellent. I'd hire them again just to experience their awesomeness.

We can’t say enough wonderful things about Chef Keith and the coordinator, Julie! Planning a wedding can be stressful, especially when it comes to food and making sure everything runs smoothly, but they handled it all beautifully. From the start, Julie managed all the logistics with so much care and patience, even with our many particular requests, while Chef Keith wowed us with his incredible cooking. We had a tasting beforehand, which really set the tone for what we could expect on the big day. The appetizers—bruschetta, pigs in a blanket, and caprese skewers—were a hit right out of the gate. For dinner, they served perfectly cooked chicken, brisket, roasted mixed veggies, potatoes, and homemade rolls that tasted like they came straight from grandma’s kitchen. The bartenders they brought along were fantastic as well, keeping drinks flowing and guests happy. One of the things we appreciated most was how they left us the remaining food at the end of the night—because let’s be honest, wedding food this good deserves an encore! Our guests couldn’t stop raving about how delicious everything was, with many going back for seconds (and even thirds). Your Kitchen Chef truly made the dining experience one of the highlights of our daughter’s wedding day. We highly recommend them to anyone looking for amazing food, impeccable service, and people who really care about making your day special.

As You Wish catered our wedding in July. And our guests raved, saying it was the best wedding food they have had! We had a buffet setup, and built a menu of BBQ pulled pork, mixed Mediterranean veggies, homemade bread and a salad. We had 2 bartenders. We also rented vintage drink dispenser setup and glassware and plate ware. They also accommodated 3 vegan plates. I worked mostly with Ember, who was the sweetest and was very patient while answering all of my questions and edits to menu and Headcount as we got closer to our date. And also with Cindy, who helped pull the whole day together. We had a couple phone calls to iron out the details and timeline of the day. We also emailed back and forth quite a few times too. And they were quick to respond and offer ideas if I felt stuck in the process. I was so relieved to hear all of our guests and wedding party say hoe much they loved the food. Wedding service can be so hard, and the food is usually a low reviewed service. But I was thrilled, and everyone went back to dish up later, for more! Thank you to Ember and Cindy, for creating a well-made meal. And for all of your support leading up to the wedding!

Hoda’s Catering was absolutely incredible for our wedding! The food was a huge hit with all of our guests — people are still raving about the steak bite appetizers, the sea bass with mango, and those amazing potatoes. They were flexible with our cocktail choices and made the entire catering package so easy and enjoyable to use. From start to finish, Hoda and her entire family were warm, kind, and a joy to work with. Our tasting was such a fun experience, and it gave us so much confidence going into the big day. On the wedding day itself, the servers were professional and attentive, helping everything flow seamlessly. They offer excellent variety in their food options, and every dish was prepared beautifully. We truly loved working with them and can’t recommend Hoda’s Catering enough!!

We just celebrated our company’s 10th anniversary this past weekend and hosted a large celebration, and we couldn’t be happier with our experience with Premiere Catering. From the very beginning, Michael was incredibly responsive and easy to reach, which immediately set Premiere apart from the other caterers we considered. After attending a tasting and being blown away by the food, we knew we had found the right choice. As our event approached, Michael remained consistent with communication and was especially helpful when coordinating rentals. On the day of the event, we realized we were short on chairs, and Michael handled it immediately by ordering additional rental chairs—completely stress-free for us. During the event, Mitch, the chef, stayed on site and was absolutely fantastic. He had a great attitude, stayed on top of everything, and he and his staff handled the chaos of a large party with ease. We are so grateful for their flexibility and professionalism. And the food—absolutely delicious. The brisket is to die for! We received rave reviews from our guests, and the catering was truly a highlight of the night. We also made specialty cocktails, and they were great. It was worth every penny, and we would highly recommend Premiere Catering for any event. If you want delicious food and great service, go with Premiere!

I can’t rave enough about Abby and our experience with Bellyful Catering! We started by inquiring through WeddingWire and were quickly connected with Jamie, who arranged a tasting with Abby at our beautiful home. We sampled the salmon and flank steak, which ended up being the main dishes for our wedding—and they were absolutely delicious! For cocktail hour, they put together an extravagant spread of meats, cheeses, and fruit, plus mini cupcakes for dessert, all of which were a huge hit with our guests. Bellyful Catering also helped coordinate our linens, cutlery, and dishes through another vendor, which took a lot of the stress out of dealing with multiple suppliers. After the wedding, I received so many compliments from guests about how incredible the food was, with many saying it was the best wedding food they had ever tasted. Abby, Jamie, and the entire team at Bellyful Catering were an absolute pleasure to work with—so kind, professional, and easygoing. I cannot recommend them enough!

I worked a wedding at Noble Ridge Tree Deck on 8/17/2024 and I had the pleasure of working with Javier and his team with As Good As It Gets. I want to express my sincere gratitude and high praise for Javier's character and work ethic, as well as the great service from the rest of their team. I was the DJ at the wedding and we had an intense storm hit, almost out of nowhere, and all of my equipment ended up getting wet despite being covered. We all had a really rough day. Javier saved me by wrapping up a bunch of my gear in plastic bags when I was dealing with my second sound system below the tree deck, and once I returned to my main area, he even helped me hand carry all of my things to my vehicle (in a t-shirt getting soaked in the rain) while everyone else hid in their cars or under shelter. I cannot express how much it meant to me. I've worked with Amy on another event series that I booked at the World Forestry Center and the food and service was wonderful. Can't recommend them more.
