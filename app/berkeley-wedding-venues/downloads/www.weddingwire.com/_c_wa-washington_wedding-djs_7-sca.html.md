DJ Vape created a fun and engaging atmosphere at our multicultural wedding! He read the room and kept guests of all backgrounds dancing by playing culturally relevant staple songs that everyone could enjoy. He seamlessly directed the energy of the crowd and Also stepped in as an emcee at just the right moments—keeping everything flowing naturally. He is highly recommended and will be hiring him for future events.

We couldn’t have asked for a better DJ experience than we had with X from Integral DJs at our fall wedding at Ray’s Boathouse in Seattle. He kept the music flowing and the dance floor packed from start to finish. The mix was seamless, fun, romantic, and perfectly matched the waterfront vibe. X was such a chill, easygoing presence and made everything feel effortless. He truly helped create one of the most joyful nights of our lives. We can’t recommend him enough!

DJ HeadSmile was amazing to work with, communicative and flexible. We really appreciated that he had a checklist of potential moments to have a song. Super open to our suggestions and managed the dance floor really well, and it was a vibe! If you’re looking for someone that keeps it running smoothly, he’s your guy!

David was great to work with and elevated our wedding to the next level. From the beginning he was very responsive and flexible with our time. His price is fair and very valuable for what he brings to the table. My wife and I had very little knowledge about weddings and couldn’t afford a wedding planner/coordinator, but David helped us create an hour by hour schedule to keep our guest entertained from start to finish. He really went above and beyond by not only playing the music we love but was a critical influence in how we can have a fun and remember wedding. He also came to our wedding rehearsal to ensure that the wedding party, officiant, and facility staff were in sync with the timeline and music. David brought with him professional speakers, lighting, wireless microphones, and DJ table/setup. His lighting was another highlight that made the event more rememberable. I strongly feel without David, the event wouldn’t have been executed as well as it was. I strongly recommend David to anyone looking to have a nice wedding.

As a wedding planner, working with vendors can sometimes be tricky—but every time my couples book with Complete Weddings + Events, I know things are going to go smoothly. I’ve worked with so many members of their team over the years, and they’re always kind, quick to respond, on time, and just really easy to work with on the wedding day. You put a lot of trust in your vendors to follow through, and not everyone always does—but Complete always shows up and delivers with such professionalism and care. You’ll be so happy you booked them!

I hired Disco Royale for a theme party for our Talking Heads 40th Anniversary of the film “Stop Making Sense” on Maui, Hawaii. Kevin was AMAZING to say the very least! He flew from Seattle, was on time and took care of procuring the equipment from a local vendor here on island. He got all the set up done, including a digital projector and screen for the outdoor movie (which was a challenge due to wind justs and some early rain squalls) and played music which complemented the film plus a lot of other great dance tunes. He fielded requests by many of the 50 guests and had the party going into the late hours. After the sun went down, we danced and danced under a bright full moon. Everyone had such a terrific time! Kevin's MC expertise was also helpful as I had him conduct a trivia contest, which was a big hit. Kevin was affable and knowledgable about all types of music in addition to the must-plays I gave him. The BEST DJ I have ever hired, hands down! 5 STAR DJ, but I would love to give him more!

We had an amazing experience with Bamboo Beats and DJ Digz! From start to finish, he brought the perfect blend of professionalism, energy, and talent. His announcements throughout the wedding were smooth, clear, and perfectly timed — he guided the flow of the evening effortlessly and kept the crowd fully engaged. The audio and visual setup was absolutely flawless. Every moment sounded incredible, from the ceremony to the toasts to the dance floor. DJ Digz truly elevated the atmosphere with music that matched the vibe of our event perfectly. He has a fantastic ability to read the room, and he kept our guests dancing all night long! We received so many compliments about how fun and seamless the entire evening felt, and a huge part of that was thanks to him. If you’re looking for a DJ who is professional, skilled, and genuinely incredible to work with, we highly recommend DJ Digz and Bamboo Beats. They helped make our wedding unforgettable!

The DJ was amazing, Bob went above what we expected and I need to mention they were literally last minute because the DJ we had contracted with for 4 months bailed the night before the wedding. They were so professional and captured so many wonderful moments and memories

Laura DJ’d and was the day of coordinator for my wedding. She was amazing and handled the whole day perfectly. She accommodated all our music requests and the dance floor was super fun. She kept the day very organized and I never had to worry about anything.
