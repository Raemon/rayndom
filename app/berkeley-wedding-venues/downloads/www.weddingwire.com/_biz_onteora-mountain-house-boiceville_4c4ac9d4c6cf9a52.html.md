Onteora Mountain House is a wedding venue in Boiceville, New York, just an hour from Albany. This rustic property sits on a mountain overlooking the Catskills and features a 90-year-old Adirondack-style main house for an authentic upstate experience. With several bed and breakfast accommodation options, this venue is ideal for a weekend destination wedding.

**Facilities and Capacity**

Couples can host around 200 guests on their special day at Onteora Mountain House. The property includes an inn, a banquet pavilion, and a ceremony space overlooking the mountain vistas and Esopus Valley. After exchanging vows among the trees, newlyweds and their guests can explore the garden and main house during the cocktail hour. After, they are welcome to head inside the pavilion for their reception. The rustic banquet hall brings in the outdoors with floor-to-ceiling windows and a polished wooden interior. Its openness and high ceilings create a spacious atmosphere for dining and dancing. Soon-to-be newlyweds are invited to use one or both of the hillside cottages as get-ready rooms to prepare for their big day.

**Services Offered**

For a blissful wedding experience, Onteora Mountain House offers a range of services to support you throughout your special occasion. The venue’s staff will set up, clean up, and arrange tables and chairs according to your preferred layout. If you need assistance before the celebration, they also offer event planning. Various food, accommodation, and additional service packages are available for a personalized plan.

**Cuisine**

With full in-house bar service and select catering, Onteora Mountain House provides several options for a vibrant reception. After the cocktail hour, your meal can be buffet-style or served by waiters. The team is happy to prepare a cake or other dessert options for a sweet conclusion to your dinner.

**Accommodations**

Couples and guests can stay the night in the property’s seven rooms. Formerly the summer residence of Richard Hellmann, famous for his mayonnaise company, the house features panoramic views of the Catskills and cozy furnishings. The two rooms in the hillside cottage beside the main accommodation grant guests more privacy during their stay. These spaces include whirlpool baths, fireplaces, and four-poster beds for a rejuvenating mountain stay.

Perfect Wedding Venue

We cannot say enough wonderful things about Onteora Mountain House and the incredible team behind it, especially Jeremy and Dylan. Our wedding weekend was nothing short of magical, and a significant part of that is due to the venue's stunning beauty and the exceptional service we received.  
  
The pictures simply don't do this place justice. The venue is breathtaking, offering a perfect blend of luxury and rustic charm. The outdoor spaces are simply stunning, providing a picturesque backdrop for our ceremony and reception.  
  
Jeremy was incredibly accommodating and flexible throughout the entire planning process. He was always quick to respond to our questions and concerns, and he went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing weekend. The vendors were also very happy to work with the venue team, as they were so attentive and helpful.  
  
Dylan and the rest of the team at Onteora Mountain House were attentive and professional throughout the entire weekend. They anticipated our needs and went out of their way to make sure everything ran smoothly. We felt truly pampered and taken care of.  
  
If you're looking for a luxury event space with a beautiful, rustic outdoor setting and amazingly attentive staff, we highly recommend Onteora Mountain House. We wouldn't change a thing about our experience there.

Our DREAM Venue -- Exceeded all expectations!

Our absolute dream venue! Not only is the location stunning (with PLENTY of areas for our guests and us to take scenic pictures), but Jeremy and Dylan could not have been more amazing - working with them has been a highlight of the wedding planning process. They are so helpful, providing a bunch of resources including a short book customized to the venue. Their mindset is also very much of a “how can we make this work” vs. “no we cannot do it” when it comes to creative ideas or add-on’s for our wedding. Jeremy is also extremely organized, prompt to respond and has a very upbeat and professional attitude throughout the entire process. The venue’s regular vs “rain plan” options were also very compelling to the point where we weren’t concerned about what the weather looked like two weeks in advance - we were excited about both options! In addition, the food provided by Blue Mountain Catering was spectacular and we received many compliments from our guests on the day of and after the wedding! The menu trial day was also one of the most fun days that we had! It’s no wonder that Onteora Mountain House has been a beloved venue for decades! The service and team could not have been more polite and attentive. Finally, we loved the option of being able to stay on site with our family and friends. It really made the wedding weekend feel like a getaway weekend and was a massive leg-up when it came to coordinating the day before and the day of. The breakfast they serve is also delicious. You can’t go wrong choosing Onteora! Photos are credited to Alicia King Photography (https://aliciakingphotography.com/) with the exception of the last 3 photos.

The wedding venue of our dreams!

Onteora Mountain House was everything we dreamed of and more out of our wedding venue! The moment we saw it, we knew it was perfect—a beautiful blend of a formal event space with a touch of rustic charm. Jeremy, Dylan and the entire staff were incredible, taking care of every detail and making sure we and our families felt at home. The on-site hotel rooms were perfect for our immediate family, and the rehearsal dinner went off seamlessly in the same beautiful space. The backdrop for our ceremony was absolutely stunning, and our guests couldn't stop raving about the picturesque setting, smores by the fire pit, and the indoor/outdoor flow of the reception. The Blue Mountain Bistro catering team was amazing too—everyone loved their meals. We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect place to celebrate and for Onteora’s help throughout the planning process!

The perfect wedding in the mountains

Onteora was our perfect venue for our 10/8/23 wedding! We loved how it looked online, but there is no comparison to visiting in person. Jeremy was very responsive leading up to our wedding day and helped us with any question or idea we had. We had games and a coffee cart and Jeremy helped to coordinate all of the logistics. The day of, I was so impressed by how helpful all of the staff were. They truly have weddings down to a science! It rained before our ceremony and they were out with a squeegee and towel cleaning off the seats moments before our guests arrived - all of these little touches added up! All of my vendors and family noted how helpful everyone was. Being able to stay on the property made the magic last even longer, and the morning after brunch was just as wonderful as the night before! Although I planned my wedding myself, it felt like I had all the support I needed from Onteora.

The best venue, hands down.

I cannot say enough how thankful I am that we decided on this venue. It is, of course, stunning. The scenery stands for itself. However, the top selling factor here is Bob & Jeremy who run the place. They were simply fantastic. Even as a couple planning from abroad, they always got back to us quickly and gave honest guidance based on their vast experience. Upon signing the contract, I got a bridal handbook which contained so much information and guidance that I could refer to throughout the planning process. Additionally, we had to postpone 2 times due to COVID, and they worked with us to help make our wedding day there come true. I didn’t need a day-of coordinator either because Jeremy was on it every step of the way. I cannot emphasize enough how much this was the best place for us. Throughout the whole process and even after I repeatedly said: I am so glad we chose Onteora! (And if you're lucky enough to meet Charlie, well, he can also sell the place in a heartbeat.)

Stunning Venue, Great food, Dream Wedding!

Wow. This venue blew us away. Jeremy was so helpful through the planning process, and Bob (while a bit eccentric) was not lying about the beauty and smoothness with which this place runs. It felt truly magical. The setup of the ceremony and reception was perfect, as they offered lemonade and water to early arrival guests, greeted people with signature cocktails after the ceremony, and had really friendly staff all around. During our tasting, one server we chatted with said that she decided to come back to work at Onteora not because she needed to but because of how much she loved it. The food from Blue Mountain Bistro was also incredible, and Jeremy managed to communicate a lot of complicated food requests to our guests successfully. We got the Beet Salad, Chicken Marsala, Salmon Dijonnaise, and the Risotto cake for vegetarians all of which were truly delicious. And the passed appetizers during cocktail hour were also amazing -- particularly the stuffed mushrooms and tuna tare tare. The dance floor was definitely sufficient for our needs, but I cold see for larger weddings that it might be a bit crowded if you expect most people are dancing. The extras do add up to make this place a bit high cost, but all in all we HIGHLY recommend this venue!!!

There were many many many times we felt beyond thankful to have chosen Onteora

We were originally slated to get married at Onteora in Aug 2020, and eventually had our wedding there in Aug 2021. Through the nearly two (tumultuous) years as we postponed and then planned and had a wedding during the pandemic, there were many many many times we felt beyond thankful to have chosen Onteora.  
  
Bob and Jeremy were amazing. We were so thankful to have practical, honest, down to earth individuals who answered a zillion of our questions, offering their helpful advice (often with a humorous twist) from decades of weddings, and making all kinds of accommodations to make our wedding perfect. (Jeremy even arranged for awesome apples from his farm stand for our welcome bags.)  
  
We and our guests had an amazing time - everything was gorgeous, smooth and delicious. Some of our guests said it was the best wedding they had ever been to, and that some of the appetizers were the best wedding food they had ever had. It’s a beautiful place, and we’re already excited to try to return to the B&B for anniversaries. (We stayed at Onteora for the tasting weekend and a few extra nights before/after the wedding - highly recommended.)  
  
Thank you Bob and Jeremy!

Beautiful, Scenic Venue!!!

My fiancé and I booked Onteora Mountain House for our wedding next June and words can not describe how excited we are to be wedded at this beautiful venue! Robert was a such a pleasure to work with, including his pup, Charlie! The moment we stepped onto the grounds, we knew that this was where we wanted to get married.
