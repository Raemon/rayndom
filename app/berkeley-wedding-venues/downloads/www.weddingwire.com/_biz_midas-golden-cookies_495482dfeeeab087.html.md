Absolutely The Best Cookies 

The cookies was absolutely beautiful, with perfectly executed personalized design that really stood out. It's soft texture and balanced sweetness made it a joy to eat, and the lemon flavor was easily my favorite - fresh, bright, and delicious. Overall, it was a wonderful treat and a thoughtful, memorable edition to a special occasion.

Definitely a Golden Touch

Makes the most beautiful cookies. So pretty that you dont even want to eat them, but when you do the flavors are delicious. Also made a great ballon arch that is still inflated 4 months later. Very intricate and carefully decorated to your liking and she makes sure you get exactly what you want as well as adding a little razzle dazzle to make you fall in love with it. I cant wait to use her services again

You shouldn’t eat Art

The cookies were so well designed, and decorated , I didn’t want to eat them. I kept a few for show and tell, and to remind family and friends, “Who eats art.” The flavor of the cookies are another reason to compliment and brag about them. Cookies and cream flavor, and almond are the favorites. We have never regretted ordering from Midas Golden Cookies. If you do, you will be happy too.
