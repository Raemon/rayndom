The most beautiful and touching ceremony and he was so kind and thoughtful throughout the entire process! I would highly recommend him. He was dependable and easy to communicate with. Thank you for a wonderful wedding for our daughter!

My husband Chris and I as well as I our dear friends and witnesses where blown away by Cherise. (I hope I spelled that right) nothing was going “according to plan” she walk in to utter chaos but she took the helm of the ship and steered it into the right direction. He words nothing short of beautiful, after one conversation with us she knew how to convey all the things we couldn’t put into words. Making this second time around even better then the first time we said I do to each other 4 years ago. Thank you!

Jake was awesome with our amazing, funny, but loving, and serious ceremony. We were very pleased with his attentiveness and willingness to help make our ceremony what we wanted it to be! We highly recommend Jake!

From the first contact I made to Sedona Elopement Weddings, I knew that we were getting individualized attention and constant open communication. Leslie was overwhelmingly helpful and answered all of my very many questions. Our elopement team Shondra, Sage and Stacey our photographer were absolutely phenomenal. Even when we were battling unexpected rain and had to change our venue at the last minute, they made our ceremony absolutely amazing and breathtakingly unforgettable. I could not recommend this group more. Price, quality, and experience I wouldn’t trust anyone else with.

We had originally planned for our lifelong friend, Jim Bednarek, to officiate our wedding, but due to health reasons, he wasn’t able to. Thankfully, he’s doing well. I asked Laura if she could step in, and without hesitation, she said yes. With only days to prepare, she put together such a thoughtful ceremony and made us feel completely at ease. She was warm, genuine, and truly a highlight of our special day—one we will forever remember and cherish. We highly recommend her to anyone getting married! She will take great care of you and set the perfect tone for the start of your forever. Thank you so much, Laura, for making our ceremony such a beautiful and unforgettable memory! Love, Alex & Olivia

Rev. Rob did an incredible job officiating our ceremony! He brought the perfect balance of warmth, personality, and intention, and he made everything feel so special and personal to us. The way he spoke, guided the flow, and shared our story felt so genuine and heartfelt. Our guests could not stop talking about how beautiful the ceremony was and how perfectly it fit us as a couple. We are so grateful we had Rev. Rob there to lead such an important moment. He truly made it unforgettable!

I woke up on the day of our micro ceremony freaking out. It turns out that my husband, who is not from the US, had booked a time slot at the courthouse for us to get the marriage license, not to actually be married by a judge. I frantically called and texted wedding officiants around the Phoenix area. From the moment Pam answered my call she put me at ease. She was calm, flexible and understanding. She even spent time with me and my bridegroom separately to counsel and comfort us since we were overwhelmed. I can’t recommend Pam enough! She is the sweet, gentle, grounding energy everyone needs at their wedding. Mazel tov!

Pastor Mark was awesome from the start. He was quick to respond to our initial questions and it was apparent after briefly conversing with him, he was the minister we wanted to officiate our covenant. Pastor Mark is a wonderful man and minister. He was thoughtful, efficient, and welcoming and he felt like he was part of our group of friends. We definitely recommend hiring him to be your pastor!

We cannot thank Better Together Matrimonies enough for making our wedding day so special. Anthony officiated our ceremony beautifully—the script was delivered with so much heart and meaning, and we had countless guests come up to us afterward to tell us how amazing and touching the ceremony was. The rest of the team was equally wonderful. DJ Kevin kept the energy up all night, and the music for the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception was absolutely perfect. The violin performance was a beautiful touch that our guests loved. Our photographer was also fantastic—extremely professional and thoughtful, making sure we got photos with all of our guests, which we truly appreciated. There was a very minor issue with the videographer, but it was handled quickly and professionally and didn’t take away from the overall experience. We’re incredibly grateful to Anthony and the entire Better Together Matrimonies team for their professionalism, talent, and care. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience and highly recommend them to anyone looking for an exceptional wedding team. —Sharon & Stephen
