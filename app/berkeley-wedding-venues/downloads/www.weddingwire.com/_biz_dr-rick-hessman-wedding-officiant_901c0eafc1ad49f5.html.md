Wedding Officiate 

__4 years in business

__Just me

I have been marrying couples since 2022. As a wedding officiate, I lead ceremonies for denominational and non-denominational events in churches, wedding venues, and on the beach. Vows are traditional or self-written, and my goal is to help make your wedding day the best it can be. My calm demeanor and loyalty to God assist my efforts in leading couples to the lawful decision of marriage and hopefully many years of fond memories with each other.

Dr. Rick Hessman, Wedding Officiant is a wedding officiant based in

Best officiator we could have asked for

Dr. Hessman responded to my initial inquiry within minutes! He showed up early, and even helped us a little bit with the setup which was above and beyond what we paid him for. He was very professional and the perfect officiate. Would recommend 1000 times.

Such a wonderful officiant! 

Dr. Hessman was absolutely incredible! His professionalism and flexibility are unmatched. He worked with us to create the perfect vows and even accommodated a last minute change to them. Dr. Hessman was also very flexible with our last minute (out of our hands) change of venue and ceremony time. He was very understanding and helped put me more at ease with all the last minute craziness. Getting married can be a very overwhelming experience (even when everything goes to plan) and Dr. Hessman walked us through every step. He is very knowledgeable of what needs to be completed and when. We felt very blessed to have such a knowledgeable and informative officiant for our wedding. Thank you, Dr. Hessman!

Wonderful Choice

When you hire a pastor online, you really don't know what to expect other than what you see in the reviews. We felt like Dr. Hessman was a great match for us, and he was all of that and more. I loved the sermon choices he provided and actually took parts of several and merged them into a sermon I felt worked best for us. We loved having Dr. Hessman officiate this special day. He is so kind and easy to talk to. You can't go wrong having him join in on your special day!

Bald Head Island wedding

We were fortunate to come across Dr. Rick for our September 2025 wedding on Bald Head Island. Concerned about finding someone willing to travel to BHI, Dr. Rick was more than willing to accommodate. From sharing sample wedding vows to arriving promptly on the day of the wedding, he made the entire process enjoyable and stress free. He helped us blend our vows with his inspiring words to create a beautiful and meaningful ceremony. We can’t recommend Dr. Rick highly enough and wish to thank him and his wife, Susan for making our special day that much more memorable.

Dr. Rick was absolutely incredible! He made our ceremony both deeply emotional and joyfully uplifting at the same time. He had a genuine smile on his face throughout and knew exactly how to make every moment flow perfectly. We couldn’t have asked for a better officiant, highly recommend him!

Choose Dr.Hessman 

We hired Dr.Hessman for our elopement with a little more than a week to get it done. He communicated throughout the entire time. He was helpful in preparing vows and provided several examples to use that he then helped us tailor for our own. He even helped us arrange witnesses since NC requires two and we were traveling with no other family. If you’re thinking of hiring anyone else it would be a mistake. He was so kind, polite, and professional and made our ceremony feel like we had family with us. Could not be more grateful he was our officiant.
