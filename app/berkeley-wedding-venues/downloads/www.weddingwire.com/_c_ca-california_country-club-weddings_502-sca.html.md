We recently had my son’s pre wedding reception. Jane was great and very cooperative and managed to put everything together on a very short notice. We communicated by emails and her responsiveness was awesome. The location was perfect in many ways. It was accommodating for our group of 40 guests. The view of the golf course was the perfect backdrop to our photos. The food was delicious and the team was courteous.

After viewing several venues The Ridge fit our budget and desires for an indoor reception space and outdoor ceremony space. They were flexible when we had to change our wedding date due to COVID-19 and accommodated rentals we brought in. The venue is best for couples that want to pay a flat fee and have everything included as they provide everything you need to make your day complete!

My husband and I held our wedding reception at the Bridges Golf Club, the Garden Pavilion room, and we were so delighted at how beautiful everything turned out! We worked with Sharon, who was highly responsive, flexible, and answered our many questions. Sharon was honest and provided great recommendations for the food, table layout, timeline, etc. Her feedback and wonderful communication skills made the wedding planning process so smooth. The wedding day was a breeze. The staff at the Bridges were on top of things and were on schedule. The table settings were beautiful, the staff were kind and professional, and the setting was stunning. Our guests were blown away by the spectacular views of the canyon, and took epic sunset photos. The staff always checked in on my husband and I to ensure we had sufficient food and drinks. Speaking of food, the food was so delicious! With Sharon's recommendation, we selected the prime rib, salmon, and ravioli. The portions were generous, and the guests were very impressed by the quality! We also had an open bar, and everyone enjoyed the quality of the drinks. We would recommend the Bridges without hesitation! Thanks Bridges for making our wedding day so magical.

They had great suggestions on how to make the venue look fantastic and knew exactly how best to fill the space. This venue was absolutely perfect!

Words truly cannot express how absolutely perfect our wedding day was at Sierra La Verne by Wedgewood Weddings. From start to finish, the experience was seamless, joyful, and full of magic – all thanks to the incredible team who brought our vision to life: Darsey, Cassy, Siera, and Omar. From the very beginning, Darsey made us feel like our wedding was just as important to her as it was to us. Her attention to detail, organization, and calming presence gave us confidence that everything would be taken care of – and she did not disappoint. She’s a true professional who knows weddings inside and out, and she went above and beyond to make sure every detail reflected who we are as a couple. Cassy was our go-to girl for all the logistics and communication in the weeks leading up to the wedding. She was so responsive, warm, and reassuring – answering all our questions (big or small) and helping us stay on track. I can’t thank her enough for making the planning process feel exciting instead of stressful! Siera & Arlene brought such a genuine excitement and sparkle to the day. Her energy was contagious, and she had such an eye for making sure the aesthetic and ambiance were exactly what we wanted. She really made us feel celebrated and special throughout the entire process. And Omar… wow! On the day of, he ran the show with such grace and precision. He made sure everything ran on time, coordinated the vendors flawlessly, and was always two steps ahead. I don’t think I saw him stop moving once – and yet, he always had a smile and encouraging word. He is an absolute rock star. The venue itself is breathtaking – with a gorgeous ceremony site, beautiful greenery, and an elegant reception space that felt intimate yet spacious. The food was amazing, the DJ kept the dance floor packed, and every guest raved about how smoothly everything flowed. If you're considering getting married at Sierra La Verne, don’t hesitate – book it, and ask for this dream team. Darsey, Cassy, Siera, Arlene and Omar made our wedding not just a beautiful event, but a truly unforgettable experience. We’re endlessly grateful for them, and we’ll cherish the memories forever.
