We booked our venue! I am so , I could scream! It is very beautiful, within budget. It was my first choice as well. My soon to be husband loves it as well. It has a pond that they can fish out off while he waits on us girls to get ready

The colors are our favorite colors so it was easy there. It was always going to be those colors no matter when we choose to get married.

That makes sense. Are you going with darker shades since it will be Fall or lighter shades?

Sounds pretty! One of my favorite color palette/theme ideas is to do a peacock theme. My FH’s favorite color is green and my favorite color is turquoise or Tiffany blue so it would work perfectly that way but I keep debating on going with more traditional Fall colors and pumpkins.

As I try to tell my FH that we have to like what WE choose and not let others or what is traditional. It's your day do it as you want and if anyone says different tell them to go fly a kite. (lol)

Yes, it’s almost a strange thing about weddings. Why does everyone feel the need to say something? 🤨 Oh well, what do you have planned so far or what are you going to be figuring out next? I know it’s early but tomorrow we’re going to look at bridesmaid dresses even if just to get the color picked out.

We have the venue and i got my dress but now I'm having second thoughts about my dress. I just need to fall back in love with it. I know what color we are doing for a bridesmaids dresses but trying to find a dress that looks good on my bridesmaids is hard. I have an idea of what kind I want. But I don't want them to be to much, so they cant afford them. I didn't realize that flowers were going to be so much either. We have our cake paid for as well. We got a deposit down for the catering now as well.

We have our venue and that will be paid off in October. I bought a dress already too when we were planning an outdoor September wedding with a gray and yellow color scheme but I might get a different dress now. 😅 We went dress shopping today for the bridesmaids.   
  
  
Dress #1- ![It's booked 1](https://cdn0.weddingwire.com/usr/2/5/5/1/cfb_1605220.jpg)Dress #2- ![It's booked 2](https://cdn0.weddingwire.com/usr/2/5/5/1/cfb_1605222.jpg)These colors were the clear winners so my color scheme will either be black and white or champagne.

What kind of flowers do you want? I'm definitely going to do something non-floral for our centerpieces since flowers are so expensive.

I really like the 2nd dress. its very pretty and it looks like it can be worn again for other this as well. That's one of the things I would like them to have. We are renting the men's suits.

I doubt that my girls will wear these dresses again so I’m being mindful of the cost and we’ll probably buy a suit because my FH hasn’t bought a new suit in at least ten years and it would be good to have a new one.
