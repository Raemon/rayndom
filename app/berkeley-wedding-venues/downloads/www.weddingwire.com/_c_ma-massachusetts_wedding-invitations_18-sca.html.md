We could not be more thrilled with our experience working with Jessica Rose Stationery for our wedding invitations. From the very beginning, the owner, Jessica, demonstrated a level of professionalism, creativity, and care that made the entire process seamless and truly enjoyable. Jessica is an incredibly talented designer with a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of wedding aesthetics. She took the time to listen to our vision, offered insightful suggestions, and translated our ideas into beautifully crafted invitations that perfectly reflected our theme and personalities. Every element—from the typography to the paper quality—was carefully curated and executed with precision. What really stood out to us was Jessica’’s communication and commitment to excellence. She kept us updated at every stage, was always responsive to questions or changes, and met every deadline without compromise. It’s clear she takes great pride in her work and genuinely cares about her clients’ satisfaction. Beyond the final product (which was stunning and received countless compliments), it was the professionalism, warmth, and skill that made this experience so memorable. We wholeheartedly recommend Jessica Rose Stationery to any couple looking for custom invitations that are both elegant and deeply personal. A and A

I can’t say enough wonderful things about my experience with this wedding invitation company! The quality of the invitations was absolutely beautiful—elegant, detailed, and even better than I imagined. Linda was such a joy to work with; she made the entire process stress-free with her kindness, patience, and excellent communication. She truly listened to what I wanted and brought it to life perfectly. I felt cared for every step of the way, and it meant so much during such an important time. I would recommend them to any couple looking for invitations that are not only stunning but created with genuine care.

We had an amazing experience with WIBL. From start to finish, the process was incredibly clear, organized, and well-run, with deadlines and expectations communicated thoughtfully every step of the way. Caitlin and her team are exceptionally talented and such a pleasure to work with. We can’t count the number of compliments we received from guests on every piece of their work, from the invitation suite to the programs. The attention to detail added a personal and meaningful touch to our wedding day and tied everything together beautifully. We couldn’t be happier with the results and highly recommend WIBL to anyone looking for unique and truly special wedding stationery.

We had a great experience working with Lisa from Mark Harris Stationers. She was friendly, easy to talk to, and offered great suggestions to help us achieve our desired look. She helped us to create beautiful and timeless wedding invitations and the calligrapher she works with did the addressing on our invites, our place cards, and signage for our reception. We are so happy we worked with Mark Harris Stationers and couldn't recommend them anymore.

"Working with Jen and the Pink Polka Dot team was an absolute dream. Our stationery and paper goods exceeded every expectation we had—they were truly stunning. Because they have such a vast portfolio, we were able to mix and match elements from their past work with our own vision to create something totally unique. The process was seamless, and their communication is top-notch. I felt completely at ease from start to finish. Highly recommend!"

We were thrilled with the beautiful handwritten place cards and escort cards from Jan. They had a wonderful spare elegance to them that fit well with the aesthetic of the event. She was also extremely helpful in coordinating with us on a few small corrections (
