DJ Furze was the most amazing DJ! He performed the music for our wedding after party and my guests couldn't get enough of his awesome music and mash ups! We sent him a playlist and he also added some other songs which the guests were going crazy for. I can't recommend him enough - he really knows how to get the party going. We also used DJ Furze for the photo booth and all my guests loved the photos - definitely worth adding to your wedding so your guest have a printed picture so that can take home that night!

Jose was absolutely outstanding! Communication was great. He was involved the whole night and made sure everything went off without a hitch. I would recommend him to ANYONE. There was never a lull, music flowed with precision. He made sure we were comfortable with everything. Even when there was last minute issue he was a true professional and stepped up and made sure things were taken care of. We couldn’t have asked for a better dj!!!

My wife and I would 100% recommend DJ Supreme. This was by far the easiest part of our wedding planning process. They were on time, met with us before, and understood what vibe we wanted. Wedding planning is stressful and I can 100% say DJ Supreme was the best vendor.

We want to extend the biggest thank you to Clay & the Trevents team for being the best wedding DJ & MC we could have ever asked for! Our main goal for our destination wedding was to pay special tribute to our relationship history, and to feel closely connected with our family & friends. Clay and his team truly delivered on this. Our ceremony music (which was very symbolic and significant to us) was handled perfectly. Clay and his team also led us & our guests seamlessly through cocktail hour and our reception, keeping the energy and vibe just right throughout the night. We especially love that Clay remembered to play one of our favourite “party metal” songs (even though it was super different from the rest of the wedding set list), so that we could rock out on the dance floor as newlyweds. Clay also added some of his own special touches to our reception that elevated the night. This included a fun wedding trivia activity with our guests that got lots of laughs and engagement from everyone, and a surprise unity circle on the dance floor that created a deeply emotional moment for us and our guests! We have really loved working with Trevents. Clay is fun, energetic, and excellent at what he does - you can trust that he and his team know how to bring a group of people together to have an incredible time!
