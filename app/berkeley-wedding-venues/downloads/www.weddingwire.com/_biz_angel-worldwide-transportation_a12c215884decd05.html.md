I've had the pleasure of using Angel Transportation for various events, both personal and professional, and they have exceeded my expectations every single time. Whether it's a small gathering or a group of 50, they handle everything with impeccable attention to detail.  
  
Angel Transportation is the true definition of outstanding customer service. Their communication is always clear and timely, ensuring that every aspect of the trip is organized to perfection. They are consistently punctual, professional, and go above and beyond to meet our needs.  
  
I highly recommend Angel Transportation to anyone in need of reliable and top-notch service. I will continue to use them for all my future personal and business needs.

This company provided the shuttle to/from our hotel to our wedding venue. We are so please with the service that we received from the moment we booked them until the very last ride at 2am on our wedding day. They were very responsive and professional and accomodating throughour the process. On our wedding day, they shuttled all our guests and no one had any complaints. All went as planned and all details we requested were taken into account. They even stayed later than planned until we all got back to the hotel at the end of the night. If you're looking for a dependable and reliable shuttle service for your event, you can't go wrong with Angel Limo!

Angel Limousine Service - provided services for the entire weekend for our same-sex service - they started by picking out of town guests up at the airport (a great way to welcome family) Then they took us a special dinner just for family, the rehersal dinner, and day of wedding. They even were willing to split the time on the day of the wedding so we would only pay for the time before and after the wedding - giving us the same driver was also a big plus we got to know him and he got to know us - he even got us to Twin Peaks the night of our wedding in a limo - amazing .

Extremely unprofessional 

One of the worst experience I had with this company.  
I reserved a limo for 6 people for a birthday celebration.  
The Limo arrived without any gas. And not only that limo was dirty, they had put some duct tape to prevent water leak from the sun roof area. The duct tape appeared to be weathered and was peeling off.  
It was raining hard and water leaked like a water fountain. Ladies dresses were wet. No alternatives were provided and no attempt was made to remedy any of the situation.  
  
We had to use red plastic cups to capture leaking water and purchased and used some paper towels from the gas station while Limo was being filled.  
  
What I do not understand,  
Why would you send a limo with known leaking problem, you obviously knew it since you put the duct tapes as a remedy.  
Also, why send car with empty gas tank and have ladies wait while your car is looking for near by gas stations.  
Who serves quality drinks in disposable red plastic cups. What happen to wine and cocktail glasses culture?  
Additionally, the driver tried collecting extra gratuity claiming that the cash gratuity is going to the company instead.  
I paid 130/hr with an additional 20% gratuity. I also paid for extra 2 hours at 130/hr in the end since we arrived late.  
I should've known better when they demanded payment to be made via zelle.  
  
This company is a worse with third class setup. I will never hire this company again for any of my transportation need
