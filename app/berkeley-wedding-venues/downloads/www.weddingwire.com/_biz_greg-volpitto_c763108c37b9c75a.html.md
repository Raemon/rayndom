Greg is awesome 

We really enjoyed working with Greg! He was extremely professional easy to communicate with and friendly. We worked with Greg to do premarital counseling prior to our wedding, which was a great opportunity to get to know each other. He did a great job with our ceremony, keeping it simple and sweet, which was exactly what we wanted. Multiple guests from our wedding said how much they enjoyed what he had to say and thought he was awesome.

More than imagined

We did not know what to expect, but Greg went above and beyond to incorporate not only the bride and groom but all 5 children. Greg made this a very small but memorable ceremony.   
Thank you

Book him now!!

I cannot say enough good things about Greg! He was so easy to work with and asked thoughtful questions we never would’ve considered ourselves. His amazing personality made our ceremony feel so special and personal. He used the information that we shared to create a ceremony that flowed beautifully. We received so many compliments afterwards. Several guests were even surprised to learn we had just met him the day before! After our rehearsal, my husband said he felt so much more at ease knowing that if he stumbled over any words, Greg would handle it seamlessly. My brother was so impressed after our ceremony that he contacted Greg the very next day to ask if he could officiate his own wedding. I’m so glad we booked Greg! He exceeded every expectation, and I wouldn’t change a single thing. Highly recommend!!!

Our perfect day

I read the reviews when looking for an officiant to preform our wedding and thought Greg sounded good, then we spoke. He was incredibly nice, professional and said everything right. Hired him immediately. On the wedding day, he FAR exceeded anything I thought. Our simple ceremony was so personalized and perfect!

Wedding 2025 wicked pony ranch

Greg is very easy going, professional and personable. Easy to talk to and just has a way with his words to make everything come together. We talked with him to share our story and he incorporated that into the ceremony. We could not have asked for a better officiant!! Thank you Greg!!

Highly Recommend!!

Greg officiated a friend’s wedding, and when it was my turn to get married, my fiancé and I knew we also wanted to work with him. He incorporated touching personal details about us when he spoke during the ceremony and gave great words of advice. We got so many compliments about him from our guests afterwards! He was so easy to work with and always quick to respond. He was also flexible with a last minute change and knew exactly what he was doing. We knew we were in great hands. I really cannot recommend him highly enough!!

Absolutely amazing experience

Greg is one of those incredible people who can make you feel like you've known him for years. We only met him two weeks prior to our wedding, and we were impressed with him from the minute we first spoke. He did such a perfect, thoughtful, special job for our wedding that nearly every single guest expressed how much they really liked him and were impressed by him. Everyone thought that we had been friends with him for years! We highly recommend Greg. You'd be lucky to have him for your special day!

Emotive and Resourceful!

Greg was amazing to work with from beginning to very end! Even though legally me and my wife were already married. Greg stepped up to offer services and made a huge difference for our actual wedding with friends and family. He was able to fulfill our needs, ease our worries and offer suggestions in a respectful and impactful way. In the end, our ceremony was beautiful and we could not have had it come together without him!
