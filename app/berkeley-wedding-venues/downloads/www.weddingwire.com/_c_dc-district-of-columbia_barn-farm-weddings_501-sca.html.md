I can’t say enough good things about Morningside Inn! It was the absolute perfect location for my daughter’s wedding. Besides the outer grounds being so idyllic, the inside of the inn was also just beautiful. One of the best things about Morningside is the list of vendors they regularly work with. We were planning a very spur-of-the-moment wedding — from engagement to married in 2 months! — and I don’t know how we would have done it without Morningside and their list of vendors! It just made the whole thing so easy. We worked with Flowers by Wendy Carol, James Bonato videographer, Melanie at Retrospect Designs photographer and Sage Cakery. All 5 stars. At Morningside, Rachael so graciously answered our many questions leading up to the event. And Shannon on the day of was absolutely indispensable. She offered a very calm and grounding presence that was much appreciated! Even the bartenders and other staff were just right on point. I highly recommend Morningside Inn! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Walnut Grove is a beautiful place for any event. We used the site for a wedding/elopement and working with Ian and his team was amazing. The site is beautiful and offers great views of the surrounding countryside to use as a backdrop for amazing photos! I highly recommend checking them out.

We booked Marriott Ranch about a year in advance. We did the weekend package so our whole bridal party could stay together on site. We worked with Stephanie and when she left, Jordan took over a few months before the wedding. It made me nervous. I had no reason to be, Jordan and his staff were absolutely amazing. They were communicative and organized. Our wedding went literally perfectly, not a single thing went wrong and it was due to their professionalism. The food is amazing, easily the best wedding food I've ever had and multiple people mentioned it to me. We loved the house, the wedding site by the tree, and the reception pavilion. I also felt like it was a really good value and very fairly priced. We did our rehearsal dinner there as well and it was gorgeous and excellent. I feel incredibly blessed to have been married at Marriott Ranch and I would recommend them to anyone.

My fiance and I were looking for a beautiful venue to show off the beauty of Virginia in fall to our families from out of town. This was the best venue we could have found, and one of the most affordable as well! Suzi was very responsive and let us come multiple times to scope it out. She sent us pictures and details whenever requested. Ultimately, we ended up with the most perfect November weather, and the venue shined almost as much as we did! Our guests could not stop praising the view over the lake, and amazing barn setting for the reception. 10/10 would definitely recommend Riverside!!

Rocklands was absolutely wonderful every step of the way. We had spent many pandemic days at Rocklands and joked about returning here for our wedding. Funny enough, this was the only venue we considered because we already loved the venue and the wine, but also fell in love with the family. Our wedding felt like a big hug from family members because of how kind the Rocklands team is. Jeni made our process so seamless, Greg helped us select the best wines, and Anna helped bring our wedding vision to life with gorgeous flowers.

We had our reception through High Point at Bally Cliff Farm and it turned out wonderful, we had a great experience with the team, especially Jessica. She went above and beyond to make the space and event exactly as we envisioned. It turned out beautiful and we all had a great time. We would recommend the space for weddings and receptions!

I don’t have enough words to describe how perfect our wedding day was; it felt like an absolute dream come true! From the moment we started planning to the final dance of the evening, every single detail came together flawlessly, exceeding all our expectations. The venue was breathtaking; it created the most magical backdrop for our big day. The staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly, allowing us to fully soak in every moment without a single worry. If you’re in the process of planning your wedding, know that finding the right team to bring your vision to life makes all the difference — and we were so fortunate to have found just that. We’ll be forever grateful for the memories we made. 💕

Seneca Creek is an absolutely beautiful venue that offers the perfect blend of rustic charm and natural elegance. From the spacious, cozy lodge to the airy outdoor tent pavilion, every detail of the space is thoughtfully maintained and ideal for weddings or other special gatherings. We rented it for my sons wedding reception. Guests were impressed by the scenic setting and the seamless combination of indoor and outdoor spaces. The venue is also a great value, with inclusive options like tables and chairs that make planning easier. With enough room to comfortably host around 90-100 guests, Seneca Creek is a wonderful choice for anyone looking for a beautiful, affordable, and well-run location to celebrate a special day. Highly recommended!
