Your Wisconsin DJ was great for our large event celebration! Everything was quality and professional— from the pre-booking meeting and discussion of details to the very end of the night after the party. They helped ensure great sound quality and volume for speeches. Once the party started, the music was perfect, honoring the people whom the party was for. They were very professional, but not robotic in communication and showed up early day-of to ensure a good setup so the day went smoothly. Would highly recommend Your Wisconsin DJ and definitely will be calling for our next event.

Smoov music was amazing for our wedding. Communication was always so open, and even when I was busy and in the depths of wedding planning they were very understanding of my slow responses! Connor was great as our DJ, he communicated with us all night and dealt with the crowd very well. He took requests, and had everyone dancing all night. The uplighting, dance lighting, and lasers really made the dance floor fun. We are very happy how everything turned and don’t regret booking with them!

We were extremely pleased with the DJ hired through the Music Caterer. They gave us a microphone during the ceremony and played music through dinner and the dance. They really nailed the vibe we want and had people on the dance floor the entire night.

We chose High Energy Mobile DJs for our wedding, and could not have been happier! They did a great job with outlining which music to play and taking requests, helping out with speeches and announcing for dinner— and really played some of the best wedding music possible!! It was hard to get off the dancefloor! Would recommend High Energy Mobile DJs to any friends or family getting married. They did a stellar job and made our special day all the more fun.

Our experience with Juke Box Bandstand for our wedding was excellent! From the lively music that kept everyone on the dance floor to the seamless coordination of our favorite songs, every aspect was flawless and far beyond our dreams. Austin played our requested songs but also took guests' song requests, adding a personal touch to the celebration. Austin’s responsiveness to our inquiries and requests was top-notch, ensuring that every detail was attended to without any stress on our end. Additionally, having a diverse music selection was a major highlight, catering to guests of all ages and preferences. Overall, we highly recommend Juke Box Bandstand for any special occasion, especially weddings, as their professionalism and dedication to creating a memorable atmosphere truly shined through. The energy they brought to the reception was infectious, and our guests are still raving about how much fun they had on the dance floor. Thank you, Juke Box Bandstand, for contributing to the best day of our lives!

TJ was our lead DJ and he did a fantastic job! He had a good flow to the whole night of my wedding reception, spoke clearly, had great mixes, and even joined us on the dance floor! So many of my guests came up to me to specifically compliment the music, and everyone had a blast. Would definitely recommend!

Craig and Amber made our day! Craig communicated perfectly with me, checked in to make sure he didn't miss any important songs before the night ended and was a wonderful MC throughout the night! Amber kept the photo booth running perfectly - it was the hit of the night and i'm so glad she encouraged people to write us notes in our photo book. The dance floor was packed until midnight and we have Craig and Amber to thank for that! Would recommend All Star DJ to anyone looking for an insane value for the cost - worth every dollar! Thank you both so so much!

As a couple deciding on how to best to pay for music expenses, Midwest allowed us to pay installment payments and this was the best decision. Midwest Sound and DJ was very professional, arrived one-time, honored our music playlist and helped bring together both families on the dance floor. It was amazing to see my father-in-law smiling, dancing, and having a wonderful time at the reception. Midwest Sound and DJ helped create memories for a lifetime.

Geoffrey was incredible from the moment we met him! He was understanding, outgoing, helpful, and so much fun to work with. Throughout the entire process, he truly listened to our expectations and exceeded them in every way. He offered fun and thoughtful ideas while always making sure we were happy and that the moments most important to us were included, like an anniversary dance, the surprise dance with my mom, our walk-out songs, and announcing our large wedding party during the grand march. He kept our family and friends on the dance floor all night and made sure everything ran smoothly from start to finish. The music was amazing, with great hits played all night long! We truly cannot recommend Geoffrey enough. You will not be disappointed, he is worth every penny and will help make your wedding absolutely perfect! Celebrations is also incredibly organized and on top of things! We talked with a lot of different DJ options for our wedding and Celebrations, especially GEOFFREY beyond killed it!
