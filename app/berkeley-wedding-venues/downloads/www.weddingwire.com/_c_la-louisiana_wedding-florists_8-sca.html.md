Shannon provided all florals for our March 2024 wedding and we cannot recommend her enough! Her and her team were super professional and communicative throughout the entire process. Shannon did a great job listening to what we (the grooms) wanted and was an expert at making sure everyone else's opinions were heard. The bouquets, boutonnieres, and ceremony flowers/lanterns were just spectacular. Thank you again to Shannon and her team!

All the flowers for our wedding were so beautiful. They were easy to work with, the owner really listened to what i wanted for my bouquet and it came out more beautiful than i expected.

I am SO happy that we used SBB for our wedding! We used a mix of the Audrey and Jane collection, and the beige bud vase tall. They turned out perfect for our wedding party, ceremony and reception decor. The reservation, shipping, and return processes were super easy. I chatted with the team a couple times before our big day and they were quick to answer all our questions. We highly recommend SBB for your big day!

We recently used Mitch's for my wedding, where I ordered a small amount of flowers. All of the bouquets were beautiful. The only hiccup was the flower girl petals were supposed to be pink, but they were white, so we did not use them. I turned my FG into a Jr. Bridesmaid instead. Otherwise, customer service was great, they were quick, prompt, and knew exactly what I wanted even though I was planning from a distance.

Ken was fantastic to work with! He was incredibly kind and easy to communicate with. The floral prices were also very reasonable and looked amazing on wedding day. We’d highly recommend Ken to anybody.

Cannot recommend them enough! My jaw hit the floor when I saw my ceremony and reception arrangements. The colors and textures were so stunning! The team 100% delivered in my vision. I could not have been happier with their work. Crystal also did my rehearsal dinner the night prior and also did an amazing job with those table arrangements too. Crystal and Harlie were both super communicative and easy to work with. Provided the perfect amount of support for decision making. 10/10 would use them again!

Billy Heroman's was incredibly easy to work with and their communication was fantastic. I shared a pinterest board with my ideas, and we had a conversation over the phone about the vision. They did a great job! Everyone complimented my bouquets, and I loved the center pieces.

I can't even describe how wonderful it was to work with Nola Flora for my wedding day! I planned my entire wedding remotely and they made the entire process so easy and helped me create a vision that was better than I could have imagined!! Honestly, this was the only part of my wedding that was zero stress from start to finish. When I had an unexpected venue change, Ashley and her team were SO flexible and made amazing decor recommendations to fit the venue and budget. From the delivery of the bouquets, floral arrangements, and decor to their various places everything was so professionally and seamlessly done! I remember looking at the setup before the event for the first time in complete shock at how phenomenal the arrangements and decor were. Nearly a month after the wedding, people are still reaching out to me just to compliment how beautiful everything looked--and I truly cannot take credit for any of it!! The florists here are true artists and definitely know how to elevate a space into something unforgettable! I am so appreciative and thankful I chose Nola Flora to work with on this special day.
