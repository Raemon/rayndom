I could not have planned a wedding reception from 1,000 miles away without Peg - her experience and guidance were invaluable. She is also a day-of coordinator for the event and takes care of all the set-up! I simply dropped everything for the reception off the day before with instructions, and we had nothing to do but enjoy ourselves the day of. The venue is lovely and comes basically decorated. All we needed to add was the table decorations and some additional touches here and there. There is also great outdoor space on the wrap-around deck, and the views overlooking the golf course are lovely. All staff were extremely professional, and the food was delicious!

SPRING HILL IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!! Jodi is a godsend. She was so easy to work with and knows her stuff. She is the reason we had such a spectacular wedding. She made me feel so important and made sure everything went according to plan. The food was so delicious and a wide variety for everyone to enjoy. We will never forget our time at Spring Hill- what a beautiful spot full of incredible people working there. We can’t recommend this venue enough! Frank&Jessie

We had a wonderful experience at Red Barn for our wedding! From start to finish, Red Barn was communicative, friendly, and super easy to work with! Our wedding coordinator was a wonderfully kind and lovely person to work with, and she made everything super easy and stress-free! We had our wedding early in November and our ceremony was in the Grand Ballroom - would absolutely do this again, it was so perfect. Thank you Red Barn for the best day of our lives - highly recommend! The value was also very reasonable and the venue was just absolutely stunning.

Cunningham Farm Events was the perfect spot for our wedding. When we first toured the venue last year, we knew it we wanted to have our wedding there. Not only does it look exactly like the pictures, but you truly have access to the entire property. We used one of the barns for our rehearsal dinner and had lawn games going on outside. Matt was so helpful in making sure that we had everything we needed, and he really encouraged us to spend as much time on the property as we wanted. All of our vendors lit up when we told them we were having our wedding there & each spoke about how incredible Matt & Abby are. They truly truly care about you having your dream wedding here, and I cannot recommend them enough!

When I first started looking at wedding venues, I noticed very few places that would allow you to be on the property for more than the day of the wedding. It was really important to me to be able to have as many of my family and friends able to be around in the days before the wedding. Beyond the rustic farmhouse/barn aspect, I was drawn to Coolidge due to the ability to be on the property from Thur-Sun. This allowed me to be able to a) do a lot of the DIY projects I wanted to do for the wedding and b) there was a lot of flexible accommodation options that allowed most of the close family and friends to stay on property with us. The property is beautiful with many lovely places for photos. Misty was great in guiding us through the process and offering advice where we needed it. Another great benefit to this property is that Misty will act as your day of coordinator which is a big task and one that is very necessary. I really loved our venue and would choose it again in a heartbeat.

Beech Hill Barn is a perfectionist's dream. We arrived on Thursday evening to find that everything was immaculate! As an overly critical person, this brought tears to my eyes. The gravel was raked, every weed had been pulled, there was fresh mulch, the grass was mowed in precise stripes, the tables and chairs were set up according to our layout, and all the linens were pressed (and smelled divine)…I could go on and on. Beech Hill Barn is the ideal blend of natural beauty and modernism. Our guests are still talking about how stunning the property was months later. Multiple guests even mentioned how impressed they were with the restroom decor, of all places. Priscilla has truly thought of everything and conveniently placed it exactly where you’d expect to find it. Aesthetics aside, Priscilla has added opportunities for relaxation for her couples (Thursday evening arrival, hot tub on site, paths/trails from the venue, etc.). We listened to the crickets chirp while relaxing in the hot tub Thursday evening and saw a deer in the field as we strolled with our coffee Friday morning. These moments alone were incredibly special to us. Priscilla cares about her couples as much as she cares about her property, which we deemed incredibly valuable. Priscilla was an absolute pleasure to work with. When we first toured the venue, she was genuine and professional. During the wedding planning process, she responded to all our questions quickly and was very patient while I worked to sort out every last detail. During our wedding weekend, she checked in and ensured all our needs were met. As a meticulous bride, Priscilla put me at ease. You are not just investing in a venue, you are also investing in the venue owner. That said, we would work with Priscilla again in a heartbeat!

We had the very best experience having our wedding at Live Well Farm with the new owners Jen& Nick. The venue changed hands a few months before our wedding and we could not have been happier with how everything turned out. Jen was just lovely— responsive, professional, and accommodating but not overbearing in the slightest. She was so invested in our experience and thought of so many details to make it perfect. The venue was so conducive to a low-stress wedding weekend experience where you could really enjoy every moment of visiting with your friends/family. The house was perfect for staying with our wedding party and getting ready separately. We loved cooking breakfast the morning of and eating pancakes all together around the dining room table and then ending the night with s’mores around the fire in our PJs. The property was the perfect size and allowed people to spread out but still felt intimate. The landscaping is stunning and we saved thousands of dollars on flowers/decor bc you simply don’t need it! Grounded, classic, timeless New England, elevated but not stuffy was our goal and Live Well nailed all the boxes. Would have our wedding here a million times over.

My wife and I had our wedding here in August 2025 and it was absolutely amazing! From the first time we toured the venue, to the day of our wedding Barbra and her staff was extremely attentive and so helpful! Always a email or phone call away, had answers answers to all our questions and solutions to any problem we ran into. Barbra was our day of coordinator as well and went above and beyond to ensure everything went smoothly and to plan. The venue itself is absolutely beautiful and has everything you will need and more! We cannot thank them and recommend their venue enough!

We can't imagine our wedding celebrations anywhere other than Flanagan Farm! We fell in love with Flanagan immediately when we visited and we both knew it was the perfect venue to showcase the beauty and history of Maine while also having the freedom to design and curate our wedding weekend in a way that reflected us and our relationship. Essie and Mike have put so much thought into the design, aesthetic, and layout of Flanagan Farm and were so available to assist with any questions, provide vendor recommendations, and check in to make sure we were feeling prepared over the two years we worked with them - they made us feel so comfortable and excited! We loved that we were the only wedding for the weekend and that we had access to the property from Thursday - Sunday. It helped us ease into the wedding celebrations and not feel rushed. We also really enjoyed having our wedding party stay with us onsite at the farm house. We even hosted a small wedding party and family gathering on Thursday night to kickoff the wedding weekend, and we're so grateful Flanagan provides such a beautiful space for multiple gatherings throughout the weekend. Truly, don't look any further than Flanagan - you will be in great hands with Essie and Mike and have such a beautiful wedding weekend that you'll remember forever. We couldn't be happier and Flanagan will always have a special place in our hearts.
