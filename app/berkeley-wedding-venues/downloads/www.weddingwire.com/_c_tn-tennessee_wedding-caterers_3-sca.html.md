We contracted with Drapers Catering of Memphis for our daughter and son-in-laws wedding and it was the best decision! Matt and Conner are both professional, respond in a timely manner, quick to help make adjustments/ recommendations throughout the process up to the day of the event. The food was outstanding (Parmesan Chicken, Herb Turkey and Beef Tip Carving Stations) were a hit along with all the sides and appetizers. Our guests raved about the food as well as our signature cocktails (they followed our drink menus exactly!) We had 95 guests in attendance - we had a lead staff coordinator and 7 additional servers - every single one operated seamlessly from the set up to the tear down, sending us with labeled trays of food kept nice and warm for us to enjoy the next day. We would highly recommend scheduling a food tasting with Drapers to experience first hand the excellence of their food options. Extremely satisfied customers! Thanks Matt, Conner and your entire staff at Drapers!

Crave did a great job careering our wedding. The food was excellent and complimented by many guests. In preparation for the wedding, the staff were responsive and flexible. During the event, the catering staff went above and beyond to serve our guests and clean the venue. We were very impressed

I cannot say enough about their delicious food! We loved our brunch-themed small plate station menu and it was the talk of our wedding, people still ask us about it! The entire team was so wonderful adjusting to our needs and requests, including specific onion allergies. Because of COVID-19 we had to greatly reduce our guest list and they worked to ensure we could still keep our original setup with adding extra safety procedures. Their staff was also incredibly responsive and efficient with communication. Definitely recommend them for any of your catering needs.

Hire Chef Penelope!!! She and her team did an incredible job! The first thing our guests said as soon as we spoke to them was how good the food was!!! That is not common for wedding food. For someone to serve 175 people and the food be amazing is almost unheard of. Highly, highly recommend! I wish I had more pictures to show!

Pig & Pie catered my wedding at Front Porch Farms on 11/01/2025. When it was time to choose a catering service. Chef John invited us and other couples hosting their weddings at FPF to a FREE food tasting at Front Porch Farms. He cooked a variety of food samples for us to try. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Literally there was nothing that my Husband and I did not like. We ended up going with the Pasta Bar. Multiple types of noodles, sauces, toppings, salad, garlic bread! It was soooooo good. I wish I could have it again right now thinking about it! Chef John and his team came in, set everything up, handled all the dishes, cleaning off the tables and serving the food. They cleaned up and also make sure we had to-go boxes of food for the night after the wedding! Something you do not think about. I would HIGHLY recommend contacting Chef John!
