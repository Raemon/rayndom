**Facilities and Capacity**

With a 360-degree view of Dogwood Farms and a 13,000-square-foot stable, this spacious venue can accommodate up to 400 guests. Meriwether Manor provides a spectacular backdrop for a charming, rural celebration with indoor and outdoor options available. This venue was previously an equestrian training facility for thoroughbreds.

The traditional barn is ideal for an indoor ceremony or reception. This expansive event space features white pine hardwood floors, beautiful pine beams, and a bar area.

Best Venue 

Our wedding day was a day I will never forget and I have Abby Manor to thank for that. We felt like family every time we came to take measurements or pictures. The venue itself is naturally beautiful, rustic, and classy all at the same. The property has endless options for pictures with natural beauty every where. I recommend Abby Manor to any bride looking for a beautiful place to get married with a family feel. Tab was amazing with checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed leading up the big day and even on the big day. Thanks again for helping us create memories we will never forget.

We couldn't have dreamed of a better venue! From the second I contacted Tab, I felt like this was the right place. As soon as we pulled up to the venue, we both knew! Everything about Abby Manor is absolutely perfect. The bridal suite and groom's clubhouse are great for getting ready the day of, there's plenty of space in both. The property is gorgeous! The barn is absolutely beautiful and Tab and Kelli have paid attention to every detail to make it the best place to have a wedding. Tab and Kellie were a breeze to work with and super flexible. We've been married over a year now, and people still tell us how gorgeous our wedding venue was! I cannot recommend Abby Manor enough!

I cannot say enough amazing things about Abby Manor!! The venue is absolutely gorgeous. It has the rustic feel if you’re looking for that, but very elegant and classic as well. Everyone at our wedding was complimenting the venue and telling us how amazing it was!! The set up is perfect, because they have a gorgeous bridal suite in the stable to get ready in (my hair and makeup people said it’s the best they’ve ever seen) and a grooms suite as well. They have a room set up for just a photo booth, which our guest absolutely loved. Tab is awesome to work with and went above and beyond to make sure our day was special and nothing went wrong. He is extremely friendly and all of our guests that talked with him loved him. We were planing our wedding states away so it was difficult, but Tab was so helpful and let us stop by the venue whenever we needed and really worked with our schedule. If you want a venue that your guests will love and be blown away by, go with Abby Manor!!! Our dream wedding was possible because of Abby Manor and Tab!!!

Abby Manor is truly a hidden gem. Luckily a coworker recommended them to us, or I'm not sure we would of found this treasure. I had always dreamed of a barn wedding, and Abby Manor exceeded my dreams and expectations. Aside from the gorgeous venue and property, the owners are the absolute best. We could not have found a better venue, if we would have built it ourselves. We are beyond words pleased with everything, and can not thank Tab enough. We look forward to hopefully working with Abby Manor again in the future.
