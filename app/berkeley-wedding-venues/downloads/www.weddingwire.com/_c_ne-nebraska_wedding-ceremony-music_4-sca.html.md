Karlyn is SO talented! She has a voice of an angel and made our daughter and now son in laws wedding absolutely beautiful. So good in fact, we had people asking if it was pre-recorded because she was in a balcony where guests could not see her. We asked her to include a violin and cello as well and that really brought it all together. I can not say enough good things about her. She was easy to work with, kind and extremely professional. She knew the right questions to ask to help make for a spectacular ceremony. Book her! You will NOT be disappointed!

My one "must-have" for my formal morning wedding was a live string quartet. Vicki and the other musician's performance exceeded my expectations - the quality and selection of music was beautiful and perfect! The processional music was moving and personal, and the music during the prelude and reception was the perfect elegant backdrop. I planned my Nebraska wedding remotely from Denver. Vicki was in constant communication with me, reassuring me, during the planning. In the end - I could not have been happier. My guests all commented on what a beautiful touch the music added to this special day.

I cannot thank Jules and Joe enough for making our wedding absolutely perfect! They sang for our wedding and cocktail hour afterward on May 1, 2022. I knew right away when I talked to them and saw videos of their work that we needed them for our special day. Not only are they amazing to listen to, but also very professional and easy to work with. They always returned messages quickly and were very organized. We got so many compliments on them! My only regret is that I was too busy as the bride to actually relax and listen to all of their songs and truly appreciate them! Hire them, you will not regret it!

Molly was an amazing music coordinator for our wedding! She was quick to reply to messages, reviewed our entire wedding program, and walked us through the whole planning progress with spreadsheets of recommendations. She is organized, professional, and on top of everything. Molly made preparing for the wedding easy and gave me the confidence of one less thing to worry about. Molly went above and beyond with coordinating the other singer and the piano player too as well as working out mics and stands the day of. I can't recommend her enough!

The Midlands String Quartet performed at our large church wedding this summer, and did an excellent job. We reviewed several other quartets and found that we liked Midland's sound and song selection best. They were immediately responsive and easy to communicate with. They worked with us to pick what songs we wanted during our ceremony and even helped to coordinate a vocalist as well. They sounded great at the wedding and we had multiple people comment on their quality.
