## About

Hi friends!  
I’m a singer-songwriter based in San Diego, specializing in live music for weddings, private parties, and corporate events. My repertoire includes timeless favorites and top 40 classics by artists like Norah Jones, Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder, The Beach Boys, and Elvis Presley.

For weddings, I offer a highly customized experience, each couple selects their favorite songs, and I craft intimate, heartfelt versions tailored specifically for their ceremony. I invest weeks (sometimes months) of preparation to ensure every detail reflects their unique vibe.

Because of the care and personalization I offer, my pricing is slightly above average, but the experience is deeply personal and intentionally crafted. If you're curious, feel free to reach out! I'm happy to create a custom demo snippet of your special song if it’s not already on my setlist.

I offer a solo, duo, trio and full band configuration, and with over 200 events under my belt in the past three years, I'm not only excited to plan your next event but prepared to help make it really special!

Amazingly talented voice who added such a special touch to our wedding day!

Asking Marelle to play at our wedding was one of the best choices we made during our planning! She is extremely talented and has such a unique and beautiful voice. It goes without saying that she was very professional and a pleasure to work with, but what stood out the most were the special touches she added to the music. She spent time learning new material for song requests that had special meaning for us and when she played timed the songs out just right for big moments in our ceremony! We would absolutely work with Marelle again in a heart beat and can't wait to see where her talent takes her!

Wedding Musician 

Wow. Marelle was truly outstanding in her performance on our wedding day. She played the accompaniment for our ceremony and played during the cocktail hour. She was so warm and thoughtful in our prep meetings and customized our ceremony songs to fit the timeline. She is so talented and we loved how much heart she brings in to her music. Our guests were floored by her talent and it set such a joyful tone for the entire day. She was easy to work with and incredibly professional and prepared. We wish we threw more parties so that we could hire her again!

Professional, extraordinary, classy 

I heard her at a friends wedding and was so impressed. Her voice is like an angel, she is definitely a professional. She will learn any song you want, catering to your event. Once she arrived I didn’t have to worry about a thing, everything went smoothly. Perfect for any event, I would love to have her again for a garden party.
