Lights Candles Wedding! 

I want to first of say that I did not use the planning services provided by Bevolo however can also provide assurance that they are now under a different planning company so any negative experiences posted regarding Clark and Kelly should be negated. I first saw Bevolo on a pinterest and new I wanted my wedding there. I was a destination bride so I didn't actually get to see the venue until 3 days before the wedding and it took my breath away. It is a very small area and you couldn't have a wedding bigger then 70 people but it fit our party of 40 just fine. Everyone looks beautiful in candle light and this venue rang true. It's small but it has lots of little spaces to keep those who don't feel like dancing occupied from the cute courtyard to the museum in the back. I wouldn't have changed a single thing! Do not you must have a planner to rent the space as it is a completely empty venue and you'll need to bring in chairs tables catering and dj equipment however in my opinion it was so worth it.

Perfect NOLA backdrop

We had our wedding at this venue in October and the location was perfect. The building has a great New Orleans feel right in the middle of the French Quarter. Even as a blank slate, the venue was beautiful and fit our theme perfectly. You have to keep in mind this place is not a traditional venue but Tori was so helpful and was instrumental in making our dream vision come true. This is a great place to book if you are looking for a classic New Orleans wedding. Keep in mind traffic though and watch out for any events, that would be my only concern in hindsight.

Beautiful Venue, Perfect for Intimate Event

My now-husband and I hosted our wedding reception at Bevolo in March, and we had Clark & Kelly as our wedding planning company, as they contract out with Bevolo to offer wedding planning services to couples who get married in the space.   
  
The space is absolutely beautiful, and it was everything we wanted. I will say, it's probably a better venue for a more intimate wedding -- the most we could really seat in the space was probably 45 to 50. Any higher than that, and you're going to probably end up with a more cramped space or doing a partially seated/partial standing dinner, which is fine if your group is comfortable with that -- we knew our group probably wouldn't like that as much so we kept the numbers low enough to get everyone seated.  
  
An amazing perk of Bevolo is that you don't have to do a lot of work to make it beautiful. The wall is lined with gas lanterns that are lit up, which is especially beautiful for an evening wedding. And you can pay extra for a craftsman to hang out in the back and make a gas lantern -- it can either be just for show/demonstration for your guests or you could actually have it made so you can take it home (although you'd probably have to pay a little extra for the actual cost of the lantern; I'm not sure as we didn't take that option).  
  
There's also a gorgeous upstairs space that we were able to use as our own private place for dinner and pictures (with a balcony overlooking Royal St.).   
  
I know there's another review below that had issues with Clark & Kelly. I had the opposite experience so just want to jump in. They were our wedding planners, though, so don't want to spend too much time reviewing them as such since this is a review for Bevolo itself. Clark & Kelly (run by Becca and Kate) helped make our wedding day run so smoothly and recommended so many great vendors to us. They really made it a beautiful day for us. They also know the space, which is important because Bevolo has kind of an awkward layout.   
  
Maybe it's because they were our planners that all of our communication and coordination went so smoothly, but they actually helped streamline our payments to Bevolo. Originally, Bevolo had requested a check for the venue deposit, and after a month or two it still had not been cashed. We followed up with Becca and Kate a couple of times and they responded each time saying they would check in -- and they did. By the second or third time, it turned out that Bevolo had lost the check so Becca and Kate just had us set up a payment through Zelle. After that, everything went off without a hitch.  
  
There is a $500 safety deposit, and I don't recall being told about it from the outset. It didn't personally bother me, but I can see how that would come as a surprise and be frustrating. It is refundable, though. So as long as no one breaks anything or causes any other damage, you get it back. In fact, we were refunded the full amount within two to three days after the wedding.

Beautiful Venue 

Let me start by saying our wedding was magical the whole night was incredible and Bevolo was the perfect venue! Very warm, unique and inviting. Exchange ally was at the back of Bevolo and was a perfect spot for first look and family photos and they had a sweet little upstairs area where we could eat and have quiet moment before our reception. I would absolutely suggest having a wedding/reception here. My reasoning for the 3 star review was the actual staff for Bevolo. We didn't see the venue until 2 days before our wedding so once we arrived in NOLA went straight there! We went in and excitedly explained we were getting married that weekend and were just looking around. The staff there was incredibly rude and unkind and started the whole wedding "vibe" off negatively and was very disheartening. The security during our ceremony did nothing but look at his phone so our best man had to do the security's job when people were causing a disruption during our ceremony. Also, we hired a craftsman to work in the workshop to create a fun experience for the guests and to make something we could take home to commemorate our day. The day of the wedding there was no craftsman and no one bothered to communicate that to us so my heart fell when I didn't see him. We were told the morning after he had come down with Covid... The money I had paid for him was returned but I think a bit of communication would have gone a long way.   
Bevolo requires you to have a coordinator and we went with Becca as suggested. We were unable to see the venue before we got married so all of our trust was in her. The communication leading up to the wedding was a bit spotty but she came through with several great suggestions and at the rehearsal and on the day of she executed everything perfectly. She was on point and had all of our things returned to our hotel immediately following the wedding. She wrote a follow up email apologizing for the craftsman and gave us a detailed account of the night which I really appreciated. I highly suggest asking for a detailed floor plan if you can't see the venue in person and if you want to set up an alter/ pipe and draping don't do it directly in front of Royal street. I didn't realize in all of the pictures on line the curtain is actually hanging in the middle of the room facing toward the workshop instead of above the doors leading to royal street. All in all we and our guests had an amazing time!!

Venue is perfect.. But horrible management

I just want to start off by saying that my gripe is NOT with the venue itself. The venue does not handle private events. My issue is with the horrible company that handles all private events. The company is called Clark and Kelly. They have one associate in particular who was very ignorant, rude, and unprofessional during the whole process, by the name of KATE! If it wasn't for my wedding planner, my husband and I would have been screwed on so many levels. 1. She made up rules AND PRICES that weren't listed on the contract AT ALL just to get more money put into HER pocket. 2. Never responded to a single email from myself or my wedding planner until we would attach the venue onto the emails. 3. Weeks before my wedding we asked her multiple times for a final invoice, when she finally decided to send it, it was paid in full. The day before my wedding she calls my wedding planner and says " I forgot to add an additional $500.00 (FOR A SECURITY DEPOSIT THAT WAS PAID OVER A YEAR AGO) to the invoice and if it's not paid, the WEdding is going to have to end a hour early". Again, without my wedding planner we would have gotten robbed my Kate. 4. Again when we finally got a hold of her a year later after my wedding was booked, she told us that we had to let her know in advance when were going to have our rehearsal, so that is what we did. The day of my rehearsal at the venue, the staff notified us that they had NO IDEA THAT WE WERE COMING. Kate then proceeds to tell my wedding planner about how she has 2 other wedding the same day as though mine is not a priority THAT SHE WAS PAID FOR! PLEASE STEAR CLEAR FROM THIS COMPANY AS LONG AS KATE IS INVOLVED. if you do decided to have your wedding at the Bevolo, ( because it is absolutely Gorgeous) ask for anyone but Kate. I could go on and on about how horrible she has been but I think you hot the gist of it. Do NOT work with this company. You will regret it.
