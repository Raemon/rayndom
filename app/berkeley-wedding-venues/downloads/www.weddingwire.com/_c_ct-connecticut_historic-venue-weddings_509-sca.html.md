We had our wedding at the Palace Theater in May 2022 after postponing from 2021 due to covid. It was the best day ever and 100% worth the wait! Audra made the entire planning process easy and worked with us to make the day just as we wanted it. On the day of, Audra and her team coordinated everything beautifully - set up, decor, all the personalized touches around the theater, and kept the bridal party, family, vendors, and guests in line! Everyone is still talking about how stunning and unique the venue was. I cannot recommend the Palace Theater enough!

I am so impressed with A Villa Louisa and I’m so happy we chose them as our venue. From the consistent communication from our wedding coordinator Ashley, to the absolutely amazing food and hors d’ouvres- our wedding couldn’t have gone any better. I had multiple guests compliment the food- which went above and beyond my expectations. They were even so helpful to accommodate great meals for our guests who had food allergies. Ashley helped me bring our vision to life- and even when things inevitably went wrong she was able to navigate through it and find an even better solution. She was so helpful the entire night, making sure I had everything I needed and making sure I was comfortable. The hospitality & care from A Villa Louisa will always be remembered by us, and I couldn’t recommend this venue more.

Our wedding ceremony and reception at 1754 House was everything and more that we wanted! We had our welcome dinner, ceremony, and reception there and from the first time we met with Cara (the manager) until we checked out the day after our wedding everything was amazing. Cara went above and beyond to ensure everything went smoothly and was what we had envisioned. Choosing 1754 House for our wedding weekend was the best decision we could have made! We also loved our suite and the ability to stay at the inn for the weekend. We will definitely be returning for dinner and likely our anniversaries in the future. I really can't say enough good things about them!

Our wedding at the William Mason House was truly a dream come true! From start to finish, the staff and owners went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect and that I was completely stress-free. Their kindness, attention to detail, and genuine care for our happiness made all the difference. I never once had to worry about a thing. The venue itself is absolutely breathtaking, both inside and out. Every corner feels magical, from the stunning architecture and décor indoors to the beautiful outdoor scenery that made for the most incredible photos. Our guests couldn’t stop raving about how gorgeous everything was! I can’t thank the William Mason House team enough for making our wedding day everything I dreamed of and more. If you’re looking for a venue that combines beauty, professionalism, and heart, this is the place.

Jeanine Mossey of the Simsbury Inn (which manages local inns, including the Simsbury 1820 House), helped arrange stays for our wedding party and guests, including the bride and groom, at the 1820 House. Pam, the innkeeper, showed me around the 1820 House before our daughter's wedding. She runs a beautiful ship with Southern hospitality up here in southern New England. Our guests had an excellent stay. While the wedding was held at another venue in Simsbury that was large enough for our guests, the grounds, and old New England inn, were available for pre-wedding photography, a lovely plus. Simsbury is a destination place for a wedding, with venues and mountain views and great hospitality all around. Thank you, Jeanine and Pam, for helping create the ambiance for a wonderful wedding weekend.

Roseland Cottage was the perfect location for our wedding. The venue itself is just impeccable--the garden so well maintained, the house so gorgeously kept, the parking so easy, the restrooms very accessible. I could go on and on. We opted to have a tented wedding on the lawn, as well as add guest tours during cocktail hour. From the very first minute the site manager, Laurie, met with me, I knew I wanted to work with her and Roseland. She was so generous with her time and suggestions about how we could use the site, as well as so responsive and helpful throughout the entire next year that we were planning the event. Then, on the rehearsal and wedding itself, she went above and beyond to accommodate us--helping me find a spot for my bag, helping the photographer with portraits, being so friendly to my family and coordinator. She even helped with pulling a popup tent for the string duet in case of rain, moving chairs and tables, etc. Truly, she was so incredibly lovely, so generous with her time, and such an amazing part of the wedding day. Roseland Cottage speaks for itself, but it was Laurie that made it such an enjoyable venue at which to host our wedding--as well as Rebecca and other Roseland staff members who assisted throughout.

The Elm City Club (Graduate Club) is a beautiful venue that takes care of everything for you. One point of contact, Sandra, for your food (which is awesome), and choices. You can choose to scale up or scale down your wedding with appetizers, dessert bars, actual bar options. You have the flexibility to be simple or extremely high end. We loved the lobster roll sliders, the food in general, and the fact that Sandra worked with us to have a slider bar at 10:00 pm. Plus, there are guest rooms and a library upstairs so there's great options for the bridal party to stay and to get ready at the venue, but in a different place. You are the only event at the venue, and our wedding was absolutely stunning.
