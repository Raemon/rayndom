We hired this charcuterie cart for our wedding, and it was one of the best decisions we made! From the very beginning, the food was fresh, the service was friendly, and incredibly professional. They were so easy to work with—flexible, responsive, and genuinely invested in making our day special. What really stood out was how customizable everything was. We had a specific vision, and they brought it to life effortlessly. We even requested individual charcuterie boxes for our pedicures the day before, and they exceeded all expectations—beautifully packaged, thoughtfully prepared, and absolutely delicious. It added such a special touch to our celebration and made our guests feel cared for. If you’re considering them for your event, do it. You won’t regret it! -Kendra & Wayne

My husband and I were married at the Maine Classic Car Museum on 8/23/2025. We knew from the getgo that Lady Shuckers would be perfect addition to our cocktail style reception, and we were right! The booking and contract process with Lubby was seamless! Birdie, who served our guests, was fantastic! We even had some first timers! Thank you so much for sharing our special day with us!

Choosing Bird & Co. for our wedding day was the best decision we could have made! From the moment we first inquired to the food tasting, menu finalization, and the big day itself, the entire team was a joy to work with. Emily and Patrick were so easy to communicate with, ensuring everything was flawlessly executed. The food and drinks were phenomenal; our guests couldn't stop raving about the delicious lobster rolls and blackberry basil margaritas! Thank you to the entire team for making our wedding day so memorable!

We enjoyed working with Maine Mixologist for our wedding. We were able to create a custom drink list for our guests and even incorporated imagery of our dog for one of the drinks. Due to how the bar service works, we were able to purchase the alcohol ourselves from a store in Portland which saved us a lot of money in the long run. Overall, very happy with our bar for the wedding.

We are so glad that we hired Heidi as our wedding caterer. She was great to work with and made a custom meal with local ingredients based on our requests. She also went out of her way to give us a thorough tasting so we could pick our favorites. Her staff at the wedding were professional and efficient. And the food was delicious!

Coastal Critters Clambake catered our rehearsal dinner in my Aunt and Uncle's backyard, and they were perfect! We reached out to several lobster bake caterers and are very glad we chose this group. James worked with us from the beginning to cater an excellent dinner within our budget. His communication was super fast and efficient. He and his team showed up exactly when they said they would, and were totally self-sufficient. They brought everything they needed, and didn't even need an electricity or water hook up. Dinner was ready exactly on time, and it was fabulous! People raved about the soft-shell lobster. They provided excellent non-lobster options as well. They helped with clean up, and took away the trash for a small charge. James and his team were a super local and kind group, and we can't recommend them enough.

Edward and his staff are true professionals. From the first phone call, it’s clear Edward knows food. He was professional, always early, and so easy to work with. And the food: incredible. I dream about the lion’s mane mushrooms he prepared for us. The steak, chicken, apps, and service were all impeccable. His flavors are balanced and original. His professional team made our perfect day even more so.

We cannot recommend For The Love of Food and Drink enough — they were absolutely incredible from start to finish and worth every single penny. The service was truly top notch, and the food was phenomenal. We chose a BBQ menu, and to this day we still have guests talking about how amazing it was. We even had a family member from Texas say it was the best BBQ he’s ever had, which says everything. Beyond the food, we also utilized their wedding day-of coordination services, and it was hands down one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. They made the entire day run so smoothly and handled every detail so we could truly enjoy ourselves. As soon as we finished the ceremony and were ready for photos, they had drinks waiting for us — such a small touch that meant so much. During cocktail hour while we were taking pictures, they made sure we didn’t miss out by bringing us trays of hors d’oeuvres and personally serving us so we could enjoy everything. They continuously checked in to make sure we, our families, and our guests had everything we needed. At the end of the night, they packed everything up beautifully for us, including leftovers and the top of our cake, making it so easy to grab the next day. The level of care, professionalism, and thoughtfulness they showed was unmatched. We truly cannot say enough good things about For The Love of Food and Drink and cannot wait to use them again for future events. They played such a huge role in making our wedding day absolutely perfect.
