Gina is great!

Gina was super easy to work with. We weren’t exactly sure what she wanted but she gave us great guidance as to what was the “norm” which helped us make some choices. She kept great contact throughout the entire process and was always on time for every meeting and appointment. Doing the preparation meetings over Zoom was super convenient. Everyone at our wedding loved what she had to say. Couldn’t be happier!

Best Officiant Ever!

We are so honored to have Gina as our Officiant. She was very professional and gave us exactly what we needed. Her prices were less than the other Officiants and included more details in her service. I would highly recommend her to anyone needing an Officiant. She even kept my groom calm before our ceremony! She is the best!
