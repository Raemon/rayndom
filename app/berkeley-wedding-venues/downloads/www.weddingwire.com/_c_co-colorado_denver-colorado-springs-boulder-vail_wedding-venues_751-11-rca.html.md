The Boettcher Mansion is a fairytale venue! It is absolutely gorgeous inside, but the outdoor space is what really sold us. When my husband and I got married in June the flowers were in full bloom, and we were surrounded by butterflies. The mansion is in a pine forest and has fantastic mountain views (the lookout in the photo is just across the street). We really wanted our wedding to feel like a mountain, wildflower fantasy and Boettcher was perfect! All the staff at Boettcher are amazing! We primarily worked with Dana and Shea, who were both incredibly well organized and helpful throughout the planning process. Overall, Boettcher was our dream venue, and I would highly recommend it!

Jennifer and Ashley were great to work with! I grew up in this area but moved out of state, which made planning difficult at times. Ashley and Jennifer were very accommodating to our situation. They set up tables and took pictures to make sure we were getting what we wanted. The outdoor ceremony location was beautiful and the food was incredible. It was a little chilly when my husband and I went out on the golf course for pictures after the ceremony. Jennifer had a blanket ready to go for us on the golf cart which was a nice touch. The hotel was perfect to accommodate my husband’s family and the wedding party. I loved having a room upstairs when the wedding ended and not worrying about transportation. Overall, I was very pleased with Lone Tree and glad we did our wedding there!

*Disclaimer* We used Lionscrest right before they were sold to Wedgewood. Our experience with Lionscrest was fantastic - it's an unbeatable venue and we really appreciated the team there. I never had any doubts or stresses about the venue's preparedness for our wedding because they were always so prepared for all of our meetings and we heard good feedback from every vendor we worked with (most of whom were very familiar with Lionscrest). They provided us with a day-of coordinator, Tatiana, who was an actual superstar and made it all run so smoothly. I never heard of any drama or problems happening the whole time - she was very conscientious and amazing. We also did their inclusive package which allowed us to narrow down our vendors and gave us confidence that everyone was reliable and vetted. The cost was definitely worth it, because we saw so many other venues that honestly weren't as nice but were as expensive or more! We absolutely recommend Lionscrest and wouldn't change anything.

We were very happy with most every aspect of our day! Our coordinator Jenny and banquet captain Israel were both always on top of keeping the day on track, checking in on us and what we needed, and getting everything packed up at the end of the night. Jenny kept a meticulous list of what needed to go out and I walked past Israel and our server Jaxon packing things up at the end. While I only spoke to our bartender Dan once throughout the night (bride perks), I was approached by multiple of my guests who informed me that he was amazing and cheerful and one of their favorite parts of the night. I was highly impressed with our chefs John and Tristan’s willingness to be flexible and accommodating to guests with dietary restrictions, even going so far as to create a special off menu dish for a particularly restricted guest. Our day was beautiful and we were very satisfied with the help we received along the way from Kayla, Natalie, and Katrina as well during the planning phase!

We had our wedding weekend at the Hilton Inverness Hotel and our wedding there as well. It was such an easy process and they were so responsive to our needs! Our wedding day was perfect and we had many guests tell us what a wonderful experience it was and how they loved it there!

The evening before our wedding, we held a welcome party at the Hotel Boulderado. Everything about the experience was perfect -- the food, drinks, beautiful setting, and staff made our event so memorable. Alysun, the Sales Manager of weddings and social events, was especially helpful in setting up our party. Her communication, friendly nature and attention to detail were outstanding. We would definitely recommend any type of wedding event at the Hotel Boulderado!

We worked with Morgan Conti at the Grand Hyatt for our June 2025 wedding and it was an unforgettable experience. Morgan was so easy to access during stressful planning times, even while going through a personal injury. The dedication was unbelievable, the professionalism was through the roof and my wife and I left feeling so taken care of. Our guests have mentioned numerous times how incredible the views are from the pinnacle club and constantly bring it up as a once-in-a-lifetime wedding experience. They did run out of tequila but I will blame my family of alcoholics for that one lol. I would highly recommend this venue to anyone!

The Greenbriar Inn was such a beautiful place for our wedding venue. We loved that everything got to be in one place - a spot to take wedding party and family photos, options to choose from for the ceremony (we chose the falls), a spot for cocktail hour outdoors, and a spot for dinner and dancing. All right there in one location. We also had a room where I could put on my wedding dress and hold decor boxes/purses/coats throughout the night. The staff was incredible and are clearly professionals with hosting a wedding - so much so that we were quietly cued on how to stand during our cake cutting for the best photos. They've been doing this for years and it shows! They were accommodating with anything we requested leading up to the day and on the day itself. Not to mention - the food was delicious. We has so many guests tell us how much they loved the venue. Highly recommend!!!

##  Choose the Perfect Denver Wedding Venue 

Known as the "mile-high city", Denver is one of the highest cities in the United States. It's very literal nickname comes from the fact that it sits exactly a mile above sea-level. But, that's only one of the reasons Denver is a great wedding destinations. Denver offers plenty of unique wedding venues for you and your fiancé(e)'s special day. 

##  Popular Denver Wedding Venues & Prices 

It's impossible to think about Denver without thinking about idyllic mountain scenery. While many Denver wedding venues utilize the stunning nature around them, that is not all Denver wedding venues have to offer. Some popular wedding venues include: golf courses, mansions/ manor houses, hotels, and country clubs. These are great options for people who may want to capture the beauty of Denver during their ceremony, but want and indoor reception venue. 

If you and your fiancé(e) are looking to complete immerse yourself in the outdoors, Washington Park, which has a section that is a replica of George Washington's garden at Mount Vernon, can be the perfect wedding venue. Another outdoor/ open air wedding venue option is the Denver Botanic Gardens. Just make sure to apply and pay for the proper permits. 

Maybe you want something a little more out of the box for your wedding venue. For those looking for a more elegant wedding venue, there's several estates and even a chateau! If you want a rustic wedding venue, we suggest looking into a barn or ranch. Whatever you choose, you can't go wrong with a Denver Wedding Venue. 

As far as pricing goes, Denver falls below the national average for total wedding costs. On average, a couple getting married in Denver will pay around $24,209, which is roughly $5,000 below the national average. But don't worry if your budget isn't identical to the averages. Each wedding budget is different and unique, just like the couple planning the wedding. 

##  Travel & Hotels 

The Denver International Airport is the best option for out-of-town guests. To get from the airport to wedding venues in the center of the city, it will take a 30-40 minute car ride or 50 minute train ride. If your wedding venue is closer to Aurora, the drive or train ride will only be about 20-25 minutes. Denver also has a free shuttle bus around downtown Denver. If it's not possible for you to afford wedding transportation, the shuttle may be a great option for your guests to and from your wedding venue. It can also reduce the chance of drinking and driving. 

If you're having a destination wedding or just have a lot of out-of-town guests, finding accommodations is an absolute must. You'll want to find an affordable hotel near your wedding venue. The average price for a hotel in Denver is around $140/ night. Looking for a number of rooms can be overwhelming, we suggest using this [wedding hotel block](https://hotelblocks.weddingwire.com "Wedding Hotel Block") service. Let them do all the hard work of finding hotel options near your wedding venue at an affordable cost. 

##  Weather Considerations 

Denver has a cold semi-arid steppe climate. That's just a fancy way to say that it is located between a desert and humid area. The yearly average temperatures range from 19 degrees to 89 degrees. Denver's altitude gives it a cooler temperature than the surrounding area, however, it's position in the Rocky Mountains can bring snow at seemingly random times, so be prepared. 

The warm season lasts from mid June to the middle of September with temperatures above 80 degrees. If you're hosting a wedding at an outdoor venue, consider having a covered area for guests to cool down. Parasols and fans can double as wedding favors and keep your guests comfortable. It's a win-win! It's important to note that thunderstorms can be experienced during the warm season, so have a backup plan if your wedding schedule is pushed back due to inclement weather. 

It's been known to snow at the drop of the hat in Denver, which makes it important to acknowledge the potential for a storm/ inclement weather during the cold season as well. The cold season in Denver lasts from the end of November to the beginning of March, with snow most likely to fall between mid October and mid May. If your wedding venue is indoors, but you want to capture some of the snow covered ground in your photos, make sure you and your guests are dressed appropriately to stave off the cold. 

When you're ready to start your Denver wedding venue search, WeddingWire has everything you'll need.
