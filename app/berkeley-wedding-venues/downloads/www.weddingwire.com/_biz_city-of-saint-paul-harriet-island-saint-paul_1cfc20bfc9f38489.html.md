most affordable & customizable wedding venue

Harriet Island Pavilion was one-of-a-kind. We got married in December (which is their off-season) and were allowed to rent the space the Friday before to set-up everything ahead of time. Brittany and the staff were extremely accommodating, and ready to help us with any of our needs. They reassured us that everything we wished for would be executed. They lit the candles, allowed us to compost (provided that we took away the compost at the end of the night), and made sure the floors were clean during the reception. We had freedom to choose whichever caterer and bar service we wanted to (as long as they had current licenses). We had 220 guests that fit perfectly in the space, even with a dance floor. We would highly recommend choosing Harriet Island Pavilion for your winter wedding.

Beautiful Venue

Our wedding reception was beautiful here. The ability to be so close to downtown St. Paul was so much fun and there was a great backdrop for pictures. For us it was important to have a great venue that didn't need extra draping or uplighting, which we got here. The venue was beautiful all on its own.  
  
In addition to the great space, the team was fantastic. Every time I had a question Brittany was willing to chat it through and make adjustments when needed. The day of team was also great. Would definitely recommend this venue.

Brittany and the staff and the Harriet Island Pavilion were absolutely amazing! Throughout the entire process she was happy to answer any questions that I had and was always quick to respond. Harriet Island was the perfect place to have a fun, laid-back wedding. I am sure that a more formal affair would work well here as well. It is a gorgeous space, and the mix of nature and the St. Paul skyline make for an absolutely perfect backdrop. Thank you to Brittany and all of the staff and Harriet Island for making our night amazing!

I am so glad that I stood in line in May 2010 for this venue. It was well worth the wait and was the favorite part of my wedding! I had so many compliments on the venue and the beautiful views of the city that went along with it. I did not encounter any problems while working with Katie. She was very helpful and was there the morning of the wedding to help set everything up and was always available for questions. Thank you Katie for helping to make that the best day of our lives!

Harriet Island was wonderful to work with! The location and overall venue was amazing and we couldn't have asked for a better spot to hold a wedding! Katie (my contact person) was always there to answer any question I had and she was extremely helpful and friendly. In our meeting we went over what would happen if it rained and she was very good at providing me with options and when it did rain the day of the wedding it was easy to make a decision. The staff at Harriet Island was also wonderful. I never once had to think about if things were done right and as a type A person all of the little details were done well by the staff leaving me to just focus on enjoying my wedding day! I would definitely recommend this venue to anyone looking for a great location and awesome people to work with!

Harriet Island was absolutely wonderful to work with. The space is gorgeous and the staff were very flexible about setting both the ceremony and reception spaces up in whatever layout we wanted. They helped us decorate the morning of the event and were great about responding to all of our questions and requests.   
  
We had the added challenge of prolonged flooding. Harriet Island is in a flood plain and while flooding is usually not a risk in May, the near-record setting snow we had made it doubtful as to whether we would be able to use the space. When the space was in doubt, the Harriet Island staff did everything in their power to help us find suitable backup options. We were thrilled that we eventually got to have our wedding at Harriet because the staff was great and the site was just perfect.

This sight is hard to get but totally worth it. I had my wedding there and have been to another wedding there and I think it is the most beautiful place to have a wedding in the cities. Also, the price is very very reasonable.
