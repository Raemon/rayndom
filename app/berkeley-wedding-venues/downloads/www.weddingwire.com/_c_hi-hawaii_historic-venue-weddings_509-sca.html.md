We had our rehearsal dinner at the Polynesian Cultural Center which was right across the street from our venue (Tiki Moon Villas). There was only 15 of us so it was great to step aside from the wedding stress and enjoy the day. The food was AMAZING. The only down side was that they did not serve or allow alcohol.

We are so glad we had a destination wedding and chose Paradise Cove, Ocean Garden as our venue! Camille was amazing to work with and was extremely helpful throughout the whole process. On the wedding day, they provided staff to assist with a few things. Paradise Cove is beautiful. We had beautiful weather on our wedding day, and the sunset was magical. I highly recommend Paradise Cove!

It was a beautiful and historical location and made it special for our family. The palace made it convenient and an easy process for us to book this place for our daughter’s wedding. We are so grateful and it was enjoyed by our friends and family.
