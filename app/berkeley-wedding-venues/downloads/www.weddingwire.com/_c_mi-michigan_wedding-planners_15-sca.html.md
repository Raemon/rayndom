Caitlin was extremely organized, calm, and went above and beyond when helping plan my wedding. If we needed a task completed, we knew Caitlin would handle it with no hiccups! Caitlin is a go-getter and plans each event as if it were her own. She takes pride in her work and will give your event the time and attention to detail it deserves! Would 100% recommend Caitlin’s services and use her again for future planning.

If you are looking to book a service that RSVP Wedding & Event Designers offers STOP AND LOOK NO FURTHER. Hire them! I am telling you as a bride that hired John and Lynne, that they are absolutely the best people for the job. I got married this past Sunday, November 14th 2021, and we hired John and Lynne initially for backdrop services. I contacted them that I was interested and they responded with ideas and even set up a phone call to map out the design. When the day came I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER!! I planned this wedding in Michigan while living in Wisconsin, I did not meet them in person until the day of and they are the lowliest people ever! I not only hired them for backdrop services, but also as our DJ! Wow do they know how to read a crowd! There wasn't a second where someone wasn't dancing! Music was a great selection and mixed so well. We planned a wedding after party in a completely different location in which John and Lynne showed up at both venues for set up/tear down. Correspondence was great, planning was amazing. I swear they are worth every penny. The only thing I wish I could change is to go back in time and hire them for event planning lol! Thank you for being apart of the wedding of my dreams and making it more than I could ever hope for!

Booking Adell Wymer’s partial wedding planning and day of coordinating services was the best decision my husband and I could’ve ever made. Her prices are reasonable, and ensured us that we can have the wedding of our dreams without blowing the bank( even though we did go a bit over budget by choice LOL). Adell had multiple meetings set up and always made herself available to us. Working a full time job and planning a wedding was the most difficult, time consuming thing, and Adell took so much pressure off by referring the right vendors and providing advice along the way. Plus it ensured my parents and my in laws could enjoy the day to the fullest without stressing about anything! The day of the wedding was nothing short of perfect. There were bumps in the road I wasn’t even aware of, she handled them quickly and quietly so my husband and I could enjoy our special day. She even ran out last minute to buy red bull as a drink mixer for family members!! She was by my side every step of the way and kept my anxieties calm. Booking her was the best decision of my entire wedding, and I would recommend her highly to anybody! We love you Adell!

Meaghan was simply, The. Best. We don't say this lightly and we are both harsh critics and are much more likely to dish out scathing critical online reviews than gushing positive ones. We worked with Meaghan for over 2 years to craft our wedding - 3 events over 3 days in Northern Michigan. The wedding was unusually complex as we decided to build a platform on a remote beach in front of our vacation home and had to construct the venue, decor etc, all from scratch. The venue and place also brought with it lots of complex family dynamics and people traveling from all around the world with all sorts of questions and anxieties. Meaghan patiently handled it all with grace, skill and humor. I am a high maintenance client with ridiculous attention to detail and a desire to bring together all sorts of design, culinary and other elements together into high end events. Rather than feeling like a pain in the ass, Meaghan jumped in and felt like a partner in crime having fun with us - she elevated our vision, made us feel heard and worked tirelessly to make the impossible, possible.. all while working within our budget and myriad of other constraints. A fun anecdote on this note - I despise the color white. Our wedding did not have a blush of white in it, from the floor, to the table clothes to the signage. The only white thing at the wedding were men's shirts and the brides wedding dress. By the end of our second month working together, Meaghan was beating me to punch on eliminating white from the wedding color pallet, eliciting appreciation and laughs from all. After all, wedding is the choice color of weddings. Something else we appreciated was the flexibility and creativity Meaghan was able to leverage out of vendors she works with, all of whom were top notch. I imagine this is because she treats them with respect, is reliable not only to her clients, but also to her partners, and has many happy customers, from both a B2B and B2C perspective. I cannot count how many people shared with me that our wedding was the most beautiful wedding they'd ever attended. While this was nice to hear and a testament to Meaghan helping us realize our vision in a stunning setting, most importantly, we had a blast at our own wedding and really had the space to soak up the beauty of it all, enjoying all the details, interactions and once-in-a-lifetime moments with all of our people and each other. Meaghan seems to genuinely lover her work (or is a pro at pretending she does) and, if I were to characterize her professional superpower, it would be expertly setting expectations (that, if met, any reasonable client would be thrilled with) and then going above and beyond to over-deliver on all metrics. Her services are worth every penny and she's a pro at pulling off the seemingly impossible, all from quiet unassuming Northern Michigan.

We booked Stephanie at Mitten Weddings for our June 2025 wedding and would do it again in a heartbeat! We booked the 30 day wedding planner and day of coordinator packages with late night tear down. It was absolutely money well spent, and I can’t imagine not having Stephanie’s throughout it all! She is friendly, hardworking, professional, and well connected in the wedding industry. She found us one of our favorite vendors (Scripted Rose Florals) and was there to direct everyone and hype us up on the big day - see photo :) We truly have nothing but great things to say about our experience with Stephanie and the whole team and don’t know what we would’ve done without her! If you’re thinking about booking Mitten Weddings, this is your sign to do it, you’ll thank yourself later!

I had the best time working with Nikki. She was fun, thorough, responsive and very organized. I can't believe how much she did on our actual wedding day! Running here, there and everywhere. She made the day so relaxed, calm and memorable. Thank you so much, Nikki!

Arielle is amazing! She helped us so much with bringing my vision to life for our whimsical fall wedding! She kept us so organized the day of the wedding and remembered the details that we even forgot! Lol! I would 1000% recommend her to any bride that needs extra support and care for the big day! Weddings are totally stressful to put together but Arielle and her team keeps it fun and easy! Thank you so much again for all of the help and going above and beyond for us!!!

Working with RSVP Events for the month and day of the wedding was one of the best decisions we made. Adrien made sure we were in good shape on our end and that we weren't forgetting anything. She also communicated with all of our vendors about the timeline and logistics for the day, which saved us so much time and energy. It was a great comfort to know that everyone was on the same page. On our wedding day we felt in such good hands, knowing that any issues that may arise would be handled. Adrien kept us on schedule so we didn't have to worry about anything besides being present and enjoying ourselves. She and Wendy also helped with little things we wouldn't have thought to ask for, like making sure we had appetizers and drinks ready for us at our table. On top of all of this, they were so sweet and seemed genuinely happy to be helpful to us on our special day. We are so happy we worked with RSVP Events and highly recommend them to anyone who is considering hiring a wedding coordinator. Thank you so much for making our wedding day run so smoothly, Adrien and Wendy! We had such a wonderful day and you helped make it happen.

it is very easy to find an event planner that is creative and dedicated, however, it is very hard to find one that is both of those things in addition to also being emotionally connected to their clients. Dalia Atisha treated me like family, she cared about everything as if it was her own family member's wedding. She took action and guidance, and always remained patient with me when I was not doing my best at communicating. Go with Dalia if you want a caring and comforting person who will put you first.
