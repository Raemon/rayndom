Wonderful Experience

I cannot express enough how absolutely thrilled I am with our wedding venue choice. From the moment we stepped foot onto the grounds, I knew it was the place I always envisioned. It has always been my dream to have a ceremony with a breathtaking view, and this venue delivered on every level.  
  
The highlight of our wedding day was undoubtedly the stunning sunset that adorned the horizon as we exchanged our vows. It felt like a fairytale come true, and I am forever grateful to the team for making that moment possible. Their attention to detail and dedication to ensuring every aspect of our day was perfect truly made us feel like VIPs.  
  
The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our needs and preferences. From the initial planning stages to the day of the event, they were professional, friendly, and attentive. They listened to our vision and executed it flawlessly, making the entire planning process a breeze.  
I cannot recommend this wedding venue enough. It truly exceeded all of our expectations and made our dream wedding a reality. If you are searching for a venue that will take your breath away, provide top-notch service, and make you feel like a VIP, look no further. Trust me, it is worth every penny.

The best day Ever!!

We have long awaited for our wedding reception with City Cruises by Hornblower since 2020. Let me tell you…..they did not disappoint! We ended up on the Spirit and it was a night to remember! Between the delicious food, drinks, fabulous staff, and the cruise route was amazing! I got nothing but compliments from ALL my guests regarding how great of a time they had and they’ve never experienced something like this before. Thank you City Cruises aka Hornblower for making this possible!!

Wow, what a day!

We went from having a small lunch with our family in San Francisco to finding Polly and Hornblower Cruises, and we could not have been happier with our experience and our wedding day.   
  
Polly is amazing. She takes the time to listen, ask the right questions and make sure you feel comfortable during every step of the planning process. Her team was so great to work with and even though most of the planning was done virtually since don't live in California anymore, we felt so cared for.  
Polly took the time during our phone calls and video conferences to explain the details and get us the best deal for our budget. When we did visit in-person, the team was able to show us the boat, let us taste the amazing cake and helped us pick external vendors for our flowers and food. And our day was truly amazing. Every guest loved it and we honestly had such a fun and relaxing day because of all the behind the scenes work Polly and her team did.   
  
We have stayed in touch with Polly 2 years after our wedding and are excited for the friendship that has formed. Strongly recommend checking them out!!

I called Hornblower to inquire about at wedding reception and was connected with Mr. John Barrall, Hornblowers wedding and event coordinator who informed me that they do full weddings onboard and I was sold. John was amazing start to finish!He kept in constant contact with me, and even checked in every once in while to make sure that everything was to our liking and going as planned. He was also very understanding, had a professional and happy demeanor throughout and played a big part in making me feel like a special bride.I couldn’t wait to marry the man of my dreams. On the day once I arrived I was greeted by a member of the Hornblower staff. At 6pm  
she guided my fiance onto the yacht, then once in place she came to bring me on. Everything was setup like a mini chapel with our guests seated and Captain Enrique Gonzalez waiting to marry us. Captain Gonzalez was amazing, and very funny. After the ceremony we were greeted with a champagne toast by our Matrie’D Gabriel who led us downstairs for our first dance. We had the ship to ourselves this whole time, before they let on other guests. Gabriel was on point all night, constantly made sure everyone in our party was cared for with a smile on his face and a pleasant demeanor. He was awesome! The whole Infinity staff were smiling and made us feel special and cheery. DJ Kev was awesome as well, he incorporated songs I requested,&had us everyone out of their seats. This time on the Infinity felt special and different than our other times we've been onboard. Our tables were set-up different, and instead of one waiter taking good care of us we had a team of waiters. Everything was perfect and my husband, our guests and I had an amazing night! The drinks were strong,the food was delicious, the cake was so beautiful, and the DJ literally had everyone dancing all night. We are still getting compliments on our wedding. From planning on day one, to the end of the night on my big day I had a blast.

We availed of Hornblower's Wedding Package because it was complete and hassle free not to mention unique, imagine getting married on a yacht! Hornblower provided an officiant for our ceremony (the captain of the yacht), we were attended to by an excellent crew, their food and open bar were excellent and they also provided a wedding cake made by one of the top bakeshops in San Diego. Kristie, Hornblower's Events Manager was very helpful, professional and pleasant to deal with. The package wasn't as costly as we expected, considering that we also rented the yacht and cruised around the bay. It was definitely worth every penny. We highly recommend Hornblower to friends who want an intimate wedding or for those who simply want to have a unique event or a romantic dinner.

The Hornblower was the perfect venue for our wedding. Our guests loved it and are still talking about it. Polly was our event coordinator and we was amazing. She was quick to respond to emails and she helped us with ideas and finding vendors! The food, drinks and staff we are all amazing!

Definitely recommend Hornblower! Many of the other providers in the area actually use the Hornblower Yachts, so you have to pay twice, once for the yacht rental, and once for the food. Going with Hornblower saved us $3-4k.
