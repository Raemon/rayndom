My favorite feature is the seating chart!

I used Greenvelope for my first marriage back in 2017 and they were great at that time. They were my first vendor choice for my second marriage in 2025 and I was blown away by how much they've grown. The ability to really get detailed with the customization of the wedding invite and all the beautiful envelopes, effects, invite fonts and colors, it's all gorgeous! My guests really loved how personal it could get. And the side bar of information on where to buy gifts, links to FAQs about the wedding, parking, location for ceremony and reception made it so easy for them to add it to their calendar after RSVP. Speaking of RSVP! I love being able to give a questionnaire of things I need my guests to reply on and not have to chase them down to get the answers. I got dietary restrictions added into a table to instantly hand my caterer. I had their song list to instantly hand my DJ. and my favorite feature is that they use your guest list of attending guests to populate your seating chart!! you can even use a little diagram to do the table arrangements and numbers to help seat people exactly where you want them to hand to the coordinator. This is like the hub to your wedding planning. My husband and I were both able to get into the dashboard and speak with our guests and make sure they had answers to all their questions. I even did follow-up personalized thank-yous from within Greenvelope! I need more reasons to use them! Maybe an expensive baby shower? :)

Seamless Experience

Greenvelope was very easy to use for our wedding invitations! There were lots of design options and the step by step instructions were very clear. It was also simple to track who it was sent to and who opened it. Highly recommend.

The perfect way to send an Evite! 

Fast, easy yet classy way to send Evites. Needed invitations for a last minute event and we were able to get these customized and sent out within a couple days. The rsvp tracking is so helpful and gives you all kinds of stats and opening rates. We did not have to sacrifice quality and class because we sent evites rather than physical invitations. I will use them again in the future.

Amazing selection and modification options!

I loved using this for my wedding invites!! There were so many features to use that I couldn’t find on any other e-vite wesbite and app. It has many options to communicate with guests easily and find out any info you would possibly need, plus it was so user friendly. I had a small error with a payment that was my fault as I was doing something wrong. When I called in, I was speaking with a rep in 30 seconds after answering some yes or no questions and my issue was fixed instantly! I highly recommend to someone who wants to make invitations that are easy but also as detail oriented as you would like!

Great Experience and Easy to use

The templates are great and add an extra ease of use to everything. Value for money and perfect if you prefer digital invitations instead of the traditional.

My Recovery Journey With The Best Crypto Recovery Company Lee Ultimate Hacker

As an entrepreneur, I’m always looking for new opportunities. A few years ago, Bitcoin caught my eye. I invested in mining equipment and started accumulating Bitcoin, storing it securely with a decryption key. Business picked up, and I moved on to other ventures, forgetting about my Bitcoin stash. Recently, I checked the value of my Bitcoins and was shocked to find they were worth $700,000! Excited, I tried to access my wallet, but I couldn’t find my decryption key. I had changed computers several times since then, and the key was lost. I turned to the internet for help and discovered Lee Ultimate Hacker. This tool promised to help recover lost decryption keys. Eager to try anything, I downloaded the tool and followed the easy-to-understand instructions. Lee Ultimate Hacker scanned my computer and external drives, using sophisticated algorithms to search for any remnants of the key. After several hours, the tool generated a list of possible keys. I tried them one by one, and finally, one worked! I was able to access my Bitcoin wallet and retrieve my $700,000.This experience taught me a valuable lesson about keeping critical information safe. Thanks to Lee Ultimate Hacker, I’ve regained my financial assets and can now reinvest in my business ventures with renewed confidence and optimism.
