Eagle Ridge is a 10 out of 10!! 

Buckle up, because this is going to be a long review. I want to make sure no stones are left unturned, because the only thing more amazing than the venue itself, is the staff that helped make our day possible.   
  
A short abbreviated version of this feedback is at the bottom of all of this.   
  
Where do I even begin!! When Dylan asked me to marry him, I remember feeling super happy and also I felt an overwhelming sense of stress looming over me knowing that we would now be entering the wedding planning phase. My Instagram algorithm must have felt that stress, because Wedgewood became a targeted ad that kept popping up in my feed. So I looked up all the venues that caught my eye and Eagle Ridge was one of them. Wedgewood made the entire planning process so seamless, and I love that each venue partners with local vendors. The team was available and quick to answer any outstanding questions we had, and the planning materials we were given helped guide us through the whole process without feeling overwhelmed. We had JUST enough meetings to where we felt everything was addressed. We never felt overly stressed or not taken care of by the Eagle Ridge Team. Also, having a lot of our expenses included in one place made things SO easy.   
  
We are based in Oakland, so Eagle Ridge was going to be a stretch since it was so far, but I cannot even begin to express how glad we are that we chose this venue. We knew our guest list would be big, so we needed a venue that was close to a variety of hotels and also had accommodating parking! Aside from that, Eagle Ridge had that vintage, warm, romantic feel that we were looking for. It was hard to envision as we were going in for meetings what it would be like on a wedding night, but the photos they gave us provided a really good example of what things COULD look like, and the venue far exceeded our expectations on the day of. The ceremony space was beautiful, and didn’t need too much to spruce it up. The venue itself is filled with many photo op worthy places for photographers and guests alike, and I love that the bar is built in. The way that Eagle Ridge is described on the Wedgewood site is 100% accurate to what it feels like on your wedding day.   
  
Priscilla and Jennifer helped us throughout our planning process. Priscilla gave us the first tour and walked us through, and that very same day, we called and put our deposit down to book the venue. As time went on, both Priscilla and Jennifer were on top of it when it came to answering my millions of tedious questions and sharing photos so I could get a feel of what we wanted. We were planning to DIY a lot so I had to ask for many details of the venue to try and build a vision. Jennifer walked us through our second and third planning meetings and guided us through a very lengthy and complex process with ease. At no time did I feel like I was lost in the planning process with Jennifer and Priscilla available to help whenever I reached out.   
  
We met Casey on the day of the wedding fair at Eagle Ridge who was so kind from the moment we introduced ourselves! She helped answer all the questions we had about food and what Eagle Ridge had to offer and remembered us each time she saw us even though our visits to Eagle Ridge were minimal! She was also a monumental help on the day of the wedding, stepping in to help make drinks behind the bar when the lines were long, making sure everything was operating smoothly as the night went on, and even stopping to check in on us as well as snap a few photos of us with our disposable cameras!   
  
Kelly Jackson was our coordinator for the day. She did a thorough walkthrough with us all during our rehearsal and made sure that we all understood what was needed from each of us. She did a thorough check through the checklist of items that we dropped off as well. I had printed guides for how to set things up, but for the most part, I just gave high level instructions and told her that I trusted her and her team to set things up the way they felt it fit best. I left some extra decoration items as well, and said they were optional to use if they wanted to. The biggest thing I left up to their discretion was our arch. We made the floral sprays for it but didn't know what to do with the draping. Let me just say, I was so unbelievably impressed with how everything turned out. Kelly and the team that set up our wedding absolutely KILLED it!!! Everything was so beautifully set up, the arch was better than I could have done myself, the ceremony space was so beautiful, and all the signage was set up perfectly. As a Type-A personality, it felt hard to relinquish control over the small details, but the Eagle Ridge team made me feel comfortable and I didn’t think twice about it. They most certainly delivered!   
  
I want to also mention that Kelly kept us on time and managed our schedule as best as she could despite us running a little late. She made sure that our grand entrance stayed on time and that we weren’t getting too lost in getting photos taken. She also captured a photo of us on the way out of the ceremony space after the ceremony and printed and framed it for us to take home. That photo is currently on our mantle in our living room and I cannot be thankful enough for how thoughtful of a gift that was. She captured a really beautiful moment between my husband and I.   
  
Our banquet captain, Xochi Camacho-Lopez, was an absolute boss that night! She kept things running smoothly and really made sure we were taken care of. I saw her working so hard the whole night, and I made sure to express my gratitude as much as I could whenever I had the chance. She was ON IT the entire night! She made sure our drinks got to our table, and that drinks got brought back to us as soon as we were ready to sit down. As an LA Native, the best comparison I have is how Phil Jackson was to Kobe Bryant. On the court, Kobe kind of just knew what Phil Jackson needed and vise versa. They didn’t have to talk to each other to know what the next move had to be. That was the same intuition Xochi had. She was around when I needed her, she was quick to act and responsive to any requests I made. At no point in time was I wondering where she was, because she was always close by to help when needed! I think I must have hugged Xochi like one hundred times that night just because of how amazing she was and how thankful I was to her. She packed up our things so neatly at the end of the night and made it super easy to pack our things into our cars.   
  
Our bartenders were amazing that night and were working in overdrive to get our guests their drinks! We had two shotskis going as well as people asking for different mixed drinks, and they made sure to take care of all our guests!   
  
Lastly, the staff that worked the evening, in the kitchen and around the hall, were super kind and very quick and efficient.   
  
The team that we had on our wedding day was an all star team and I cannot thank them enough for making this day perfect for us.   
  
Last mention - the food was soooooo GOOD!!! The cocktail hour food was so amazing I wish I had asked for more, I could have honestly eaten those all night! I’m usually skeptical about wedding food but it was so incredible.   
  
Everything about this day was perfect. We opted out of draping and any arbor draping for the ceremony space because we knew we had chosen a space that was just architecturally beautiful as it is. It’s not often that you can just walk into a venue and be like “yeah, it’s actually so beautiful just the way it is.”   
  
I would recommend Eagle Ridge to anyone who is considering going through Wedgewood for their wedding planning service. I’ll say it again, yes the building and the venue itself is beautiful, but it’s the team that truly makes the experience what it is. If you want to feel taken care of, seen, heard and like you can trust people the moment you go hands off, Eagle Ridge is it. I will be replaying this day over and over and over again in my head for as long as I live, and it’s all thanks to the work that the team that helped us through it all put into it.   
  
Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!  
  
  
SHORT VERSION:   
I would recommend Eagle Ridge to anyone over and over and over again. They set the bar so freakin’ high for what a planning team, event team and venue should be for weddings.  
  
The staff are incredible. Big shout outs to Priscilla, Jennifer, Casey, Kelly and Xochi. The process from beginning to end was enjoyable and memorable, all because of the staff.  
  
Special thanks to Jennifer, Priscilla and Casey for being so attentive and responsive to us during the planning process. They made everything so easy and manageable for us. On the night of our wedding, Casey even stepped in when the bar got busy and was helping out and making drinks. She is honestly so awesome!  
  
The food is so GOOD!! Weddings are always hit or miss when it comes to food, but Eagle Ridge kitchen really delivered!

She had great intuition and sometimes had a solution before I even asked her for anything! The second we got in, she walked up to us with drinks in hand and said "I figured you'd want these!" and she was right! The night went off without a hitch because of Xochi and her attentiveness!

Our Wedding Experience 

From start to finish, our wedding experience at this venue was absolutely amazing. The staff was so helpful throughout the planning process, always responsive and truly invested in making our vision come to life. Our day of coordinator Jennifer was outstanding! She was literally running around to make sure everything went smoothly. Her energy and attention to detail made the day so much less stressful for me I couldn’t have asked for a better coordinator. The space was clean, beautifully maintained, and they did an amazing job setting up all of my decorations exactly how I imagined. The food was delicious, and we received so many compliments from our guests. We’re so thankful for the entire team who helped make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend this venue to any couple looking for a beautiful space with a dedicated staff!

Easy process, beautiful wedding!

This review is long overdue, but we look back on our wedding day often and are still so thankful to the Eagle Ridge Wedgewood staff for helping us prepare for and execute a seamless and beautiful wedding. They made the process so easy and were responsive and knowledgeable, answering the oodles of questions we had. The ceremony space was lovely, the food was wonderful, and the uniquely-shaped reception space was perfect for everyone to be able to see and participate in the wedding activities, also offering quieter spaces of the room for those who wanted to sit and chat while the dance floor was open. We used their vendors for the DJ, cake, and flowers, who are all amazing at what they do. We got so many compliments from our guests about how wonderful of a wedding it was, and we certainly agree! We would recommend this location and the work they do to others considering getting married here. Thank you to your amazing team!

Dream Wedding Come True

I cannot express how grateful my husband and I are for the experience that we had at Eagle Ridge by Wedgewood. Starting with our very first visit, touring the venue. I had originally had 3 different venues that I was scheduled to see and when I toured Eagle Ridge, I just knew that this was the place for us. It is absolutely beautiful. Priscilla and Jennifer were so professional and so very kind, making sure to answer all of my questions and assuring me that their mission was to make our experience as smooth as possible with zero stress. Mission accomplished!! Every little detail, phone appointments, payment options and everything in between was convenient. The food was delicious, DJ Brian was perfect and really made the wedding fun. Priscilla made sure that our timeline was smooth and on time and made sure everyone knew exactly where they needed to be, for those that weren't able to make the rehearsal. I had my dream wedding, and it was perfect. I wouldn't change a thing. We are still obsessing over pictures and videos and our guests still talking about "the wedding of the year!" Highly recommend Eagle Ridge by Wedgewood Weddings. 5-star rating from us. Huge thank you to Priscilla, Jennifer and all of the wedding staff that participated in making our day so special. Love, The Tidwell's

Simplifying and elevating our wedding

We were blessed to have been connected with the Wedgewood team. We found all of the decisions for our wedding to be a bit overwhelming at first, but when we started working with Wedgewood, they made many wonderful recommendations and kept us on track. We used the suggested florist, event decorator, cake decorator and photographer. We looked around to compare and found a great value in service and budget with this team. We were so impressed with the quality of our experience and the guidance we received. Our guests were very impressed as well.   
  
Thank you to the entire Wedgewood team.

Perfect location for an evening summer wedding 

We had our wedding at Eagle Ridge by Wedgewood in July 2023. We decided in January 2023 that we wanted to get married on a very specific day in July. Eagle Ridge was super responsive and helpful throughout the very short 6 months of planning.   
  
This venue is all-inclusive, which was a big bonus for us as parents of a toddler. When we had a family tragedy happen in the middle of planning, the ladies (especially the lovely and extremely helpful Priscilla) ensured us that we would still have time to plan our perfect day and helped us with any questions or concerns we had.   
  
The day of our wedding was 6-11pm, we were able to arrive an hour and a half early before the ceremony. The only thing I regret is not extending our time frame because it truly flew by!   
  
The venue itself is simple, beautiful and elegant. The cake vendor, "I Do " Wedding Cakes - was so delicious, we were able to take the leftover cake home and enjoyed it at home. The flower vendor provided beautiful but small centerpieces (you are able to upgrade for a cost). The food was delicious and something our guests raved about for days.   
  
If you want to get married but do not have time to stress about the planning and details, Eagle Ridge by Wedgewood Weddings is the way to go.

Practically Perfect in Every Way-even with a storm….

The team at Eagle Ridge is absolutely amazing! We were hit with one of the crazy storms late 2023, and they still helped our wedding vision come together in doors. Super helpful that the indoor areas are naturally beautiful and went with our theme perfectly. Highly recommend.

Stress Free Wedding Planning

My husband and I had so much fun at our wedding! The coordinators answered all of our questions and guided us through the entire wedding planning process. We had a mostly stress free experience. We used the venue's preferred cake vendor and DJ. DJ Brian was great! We brought in some of our own decorations for the day-of and trusted the coordinators to set that up in the best way possible; they did not disappoint!
