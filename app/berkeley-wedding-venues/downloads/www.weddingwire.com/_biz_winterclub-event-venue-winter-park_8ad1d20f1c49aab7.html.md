Hidden TREASURE right here in Winter Park, FL!

BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT - BOOK THIS VENUE WITH CONFIDENCE!  
Who knew we had a WORLD CLASS venue right here off of Hwy 436 and Aloma Ave!?!?!? Hidden among the hustle and bustle is this breath-taking Italian garden and ballroom, complete with fountains and greenery sprawling up trellises. Anyone looking at photos of this would swear we had travelled halfway across the world to hold out event.  
Michele, our coordinator and co-owner, was super patient with me and is a wealth of expertise when it comes to getting the most out of this venue. She was just so great to work with! She knew I was an over-planner, and she kept me calm and confident throughout the event, letting me run the show, but stepping in exactly when I needed it! All of our guests had nothing but WOW's and I-LOVE-IT's to give throughout the night and one of our guests even asked me for more info as her sister is getting married soon!  
Their price was quite reasonable based on other venues I've spoken to from this app, and I was particularly impressed with their flexible sound system and lighting options. Michele pre-programmed and handled the lighting for us, and I was actually able to 'DJ' right off of my phone with a custom-made Spotify playlist.  
One of the neatest values of this venue is its incredible versatility. This venue essentially provides a very beautiful 'canvas' upon which to paint your custom experience. With that, they provide the grounds, a kitchen/prep area for your caterer, the hall and tables (up to 100 guests, but can add tables/chairs for an additional fee), but you will need to provide tablecloths, place settings, centerpieces, caterer, DJ, etc. They do, however, have connections with third party vendors to which they can refer you, but just know that these services are exclusive of the venue price. Also, they do offer a few additional service packages to round out any experience, including a wet (or dry/soda) bar, a frozen dessert option, and they can even provide an attendant staff as well (all of these for additional fees of course). The silver lining is that you can choose exactly how you want your event to look, taste, feel, etc.! AND, because it's so versatile, this event can host weddings, bar/bat mitzvahs, corporate events, just about any sort of gathering (our event was our high school band's annual awards banquet).  
Other perks include a separate landing for the caterers, chandelier and other decorative lighting throughout the hall, actual RESTrooms as well as bathrooms (e.g. the men's lavatory had a SHOWER and a sitting place with a small sofa and side table, etc.), there is a bridle suite inside the venue (though we didn't use it), and I JUST CAN'T SAY ENOUGH about the courtyard and gardens, just remarkable - the guests just loved mingling and taking pictures out there before and after the event!  
All-in-all, this venue is surprisingly lavish and will transport you to another time and place if you let it. Definitely worth checking out!

Professional, Flexible, and AMAZING! 

Michelle and her husband are amazing. They helped us when we needed answers and they even helped the day of when we were freaking out. I have no bad things to say at all and no complaints whatsoever! The venue is incredible inside and outside. They have authentic Italian gelatos if you want to add that as a dessert option and all the flavors were awesome! The outside is beautiful! A great place to capture moments. The inside is very accommodating to whatever ideas you have for designs and how you want to set up your room!  
  
Winterclub will treat you right! Michelle is very responsive!  
  
My wife and I will be forever grateful for this venue and their team!

Gorgeous venue that exceeded expectations 

My Fiancé and I fell in love with the Tuscan garden at WinterClub! The courtyard, wedding arch, and live flowers all around provided the perfect setting for an intimate ceremony. The indoor area was also amazing. Michelle was so helpful throughout the entire process. I could not have asked for a better venue!

Amazing venue with wonderful staff! 

This venue is so beautiful! We had our daughters wedding there last night and it was so pretty! The flowers outside and the inside decor are amazing! Michelle did a fantastic job working with all vendors and ensured a successful night! She was helpful in every way and worked tirelessly with us on all of our changes and needs. The staff was professional and prompt. I strongly recommend this venue!

Perfect Venue

This venue is absolutely perfect in every way. It is very beautiful and Michelle was the most wonderful person throughout the whole wedding experience. My husband and I truly recommend it! We were delighted with every detail this venue had to offer and it exceeded our expectations. We also recommended it to my mother and her fiancé and they ended up booking the venue as well, that's how much they loved it and I am sure you will too!

Beautiful venue, definitely a hidden gem

I’ve driven past this venue a ton of times and never realized it was a wedding venue. I came across it on a wedding wire and went I went I visit I was so impressed. The Tuscan courtyard with the fountain is absolutely beautiful. All the landscaping was redone and the building painted it looks so fresh and lovely. Michelle was a great contact throughout. We popped in many times to visit and they always took a few minutes to give us a quick update on their new look. The day of our wedding it rained and our ceremony was planned to be outside. Michelle and her team assured me it was no problem at all they could switch the ceremony inside and flip it back to reception during cocktail hour. Everything looked beautiful. We were so happy with the way everything came out. It was perfect for our wedding and our budget. I would definitely recommend to check it out!

The venue is absolutely beautiful and we were thrilled by the service..

Cannot say enough good things about WinterClub!! A month before my wedding, our original venue went out of business and I did what most brides would do...had a complete meltdown. Luckily, I found WinterClub. Within no time, my wedding was back on track. From planning the decor to layout design, catering suggestions, and designing our drink menu, WinterClub team were a huge help. What started out as a nightmare with our other venue, resulted in the happiest of endings. I am convinced that everything happens for a reason and eternally grateful we hosted our reception at WinterClub! Our guests loved the atmosphere and the garden and had nothing but good things to say about our reception. If you're looking for a venue that is absolutely beautiful with professional friendly staff, this place is for you!
