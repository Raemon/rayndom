Our wedding at this venue was an absolute dream. The space itself is stunning—every corner was picture-perfect, and our guests couldn’t stop raving about the ceremony setup, reception space, décor, the florals, and sunset back drop! The food was truly 10/10, and the service matched it. The bar team was phenomenal, and multiple guests told us the late-night tacos and churros were the best they’ve ever had. Entertainment was another major highlight. Our DJ was phenomenal and kept the energy perfect throughout the night. We also opted to have a live saxophonist during dinner, and his performances were absolutely top-notch—one of the most memorable touches of the entire evening. Our photography and videography teams (both Martoca films) were amazing as well. They captured every moment so beautifully and made us feel comfortable, natural, and genuinely taken care of throughout the day. Planning was seamless, especially for someone who is not Type A. I trusted Marisol with all things and solely provided her with my inspo board and she beyond nailed it. Communication was impeccable from start to finish, and the day-of coordination was completely flawless. I felt supported, never stressed, and truly able to enjoy every moment. Every guest said this wedding was the best they had ever been to! I would choose this venue again without a second thought and recommend it a thousand times over. An unforgettable experience in every way.
