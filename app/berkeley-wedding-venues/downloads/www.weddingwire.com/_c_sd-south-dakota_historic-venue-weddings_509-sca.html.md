Our wedding at the lodge was an absolute dream come true. From start to finish, the experience was nothing short of exceptional. First and foremost, the location itself is breathtaking. The natural beauty of the surroundings added an enchanting touch to our special day. It provided the perfect backdrop for our ceremony and reception, making every moment picture-perfect. The food was beyond amazing! Our guests are still raving about the delicious menu. The variety of options, quality of ingredients, and presentation were all top-notch! One of the things that stood out most was the incredible selection of decorations available. It made planning our wedding a breeze. We were able to choose from a wide range of beautiful decorations. It saved us so much time and effort, and the result was a stunningly decorated venue that exceeded our expectations. Carly, our wedding coordinator, was an absolute great to work with. Her attention to detail, responsiveness, and genuine care made the planning process smooth and enjoyable. She listened to our ideas, offered valuable suggestions, and ensured that everything ran flawlessly on the big day. Carly's dedication to making our wedding memorable was truly heartwarming. We can't thank the lodge staff and Carly enough for making our wedding day absolutely perfect! If you're looking for a stunning venue with incredible food, an array of decorations, and a dedicated team that goes above and beyond, look no further. We highly recommend Spearfish Canyon Lodge for your special day. Our heartfelt thanks to everyone at the lodge for creating a magical experience that will be cherished forever.

We loved this venue! The unique space was so beautiful and we received many compliments from our guests about how gorgeous it was. If you are looking for an affordable venue where a lot of amenities like tables, chairs, linens are included and you don’t have to decorate a lot because it has so much natural beauty than this is your space! It is gorgeous!!! It holds about 220, but we felt it was perfect for our wedding of about 145 people. We had our ceremony and reception here and although I was worried about transitioning the space, it all worked great! Claire was wonderful to work with as well. I would again stress they have more included in their rental price than most venues and this venue will give your wedding a more unique edge than other venues.
