After months of helping you plan, hosting [pre-wedding showers and parties](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/all-the-pre-wedding-parties), and standing by your side on the big day, it's safe to say your wedding party has put in a lot of time and effort. According to a WeddingWire survey, most couples pick out thoughtful wedding party gifts to show their appreciation—but that can be easier said than done. With two sides to your squad (not to mention an average of 10 people in total), picking out the perfect present for everyone might seem like a big job. To make pleasing your nearest and dearest that much easier, we've listed our favorite wedding party gift ideas that'll work for _everyone_ —family, childhood best friends, and old college roommates included.

But where do you start? First, make a list of who exactly you need to buy gifts for in the wedding party (spoiler alert: everyone). From there, you can begin ironing out the logistics, such as [setting a budget](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-budget-for-a-wedding) and planning where to hand over your presents. There's no hard and fast rule as to when you should give the wedding party their gifts, but picking the right moment will make it all the more special. Some couples prefer to do it early on at pre-wedding showers or parties, while others wait until the rehearsal dinner or the morning of the wedding.

## How much should you spend on wedding party gifts?

Wedding party gifts should be included as a line item in your [budget](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-budget-breakdown), and with an average of 10 wedding party members in total, a couple can end up spending several hundred dollars on presents. That said, the amount you ultimately spend per person is entirely up to you, whether that's $20, $50, or $100. One thing to keep in mind though is that it's customary to set aside a little more for your VIPs. If you have a [maid/man of honor](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/the-ultimate-maid-of-honor-duties-checklist) or [best man/woman](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/the-ultimate-best-man-duties-checklist), they likely had to take on some extra responsibilities and expenses. They deserve an awesome gift to say thank you!

## What makes a good wedding party gift? 

Not sure what a great wedding party gift actually is? A WeddingWire survey revealed that the most popular types of presents for men are alcohol related, while [jewelry](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/bridesmaid-earrings) and beauty items topped the list for women. But don't feel like you have to stick to the status quo. Both personal and practical items can make for winning wedding party gift ideas—it all depends on who you're shopping for. You also don't have to give the same gift to everyone, but if you think it's something they would all love and use, go for it!
