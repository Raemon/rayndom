Nestled below the majestic slopes of Norbrook Mountain, Boone Hall Oasis provides services with a unique experience of...Read more being one with nature. The setting is in the midst of lush tropical flora and fauna, next to the Wag Water River. Picturesque backdrops, a babbling brook and the sound of songbirds...

This picturesque venue, located in the hills of St Andrew, provided the perfect blank canvas to create our dream wedding. Boone Hall Oasis is a peaceful and serene outdoor space with different sections from which to choose. However, we booked the entire venue. We had our ceremony in front of the waterfall area. Our cocktail hour was in the garden and our guests enjoyed the beauty of the venue. We had the reception in the nest to accommodate sparklers and fog, creating our fairytale first dance. Monique, the property manager, was very accommodating and worked closely with us. Boone Hall also caters, which made it the perfect package. The food was lovely, our guest enjoyed it.
