We had Andy as our DJ for our wedding and couldn’t be happier with how it went. She really understood our vibe and made the party memorable. Could recommend her enough!

The Abyss team was great for our wedding! Caught on to what the crowd was vibing to and played more of that to keep the dance floor going. Would work with them again!

Sean Darden did a wonderful job with my wedding and reception music. He gave me ideas that I hadn’t considered for the reception. He set up music outside to accommodate the pastor and I had a solo vocalist that he provided the instrumental background and the microphone set up for her. He was very professional from the start to finish. I’d definitely utilize his services again for my next big event.

Kenny played at our wedding reception! Kenny was an absolute gem and easy to coordinate and work with. A week out from our wedding we still hadn't nailed down the songs. Kenny handled our last minute requests with ease and gave awesome recommendations. Our guests could not stop raving about how beautifully the playlist flowed! Kenny made our dinner reception full of old classics and modern soft songs. For our dancing he handled guest request as well as following are vibe that we wanted. We ended up leaving a little bit earlier from the reception then planned, he handled everything will grace and ease. I 1000% percent would recommend him for any wedding. He was the absolute best! Thanks again Kenny, you made our wedding wonderful!

Make Em Dance Entertainment took the time to meet with us before the wedding to learn about us as a couple & what vibe we wanted at our reception. He took notes on everything & gave us a wedding reception that guest are still talking about a month later. For 4 hours we had a full dance floor which is what every bride wants. Bobby was professional in sound, lights, Photo Booth, communication & vibes. I’m so glad we trusted him. Do yourself a favor & book his services now. From someone who attended 11 weddings & had my own in 2025 - there is no one better in the business!

Carlos was absolutely fantastic! We booked pretty last minute, and he was happy to help us make our wedding day magical! We were so chaotic the days before & day off and he did the best job helping pick some of the music. Everyone talked about how great the music was and how much fun they had dancing! Carlos did a great job announcing everything and managed to work around all our crazy last minute changes for what was happening! I highly highly recommend him for any DJ needs, he is the absolute best!! Thank you so much Carlos!!!

We used PartyZone for lighting, staging, pipe and drape and ceremony/ cocktail hour music for our August 2025 wedding. They delivered 100% and we are so happy with our wedding looked. They were communicative, prompt and budget friendly. They had no trouble with our playlists for ceremony and cocktail hour, and the lighting was beautiful. So glad we went with PartyZone!

## Lexington, KY Wedding DJ: How to Find the Right Wedding DJ in Lexington for your Reception

Lush vineyards, rustic chic barns, grand horse farms, and picturesque historic mansions make Lexington, Kentucky an amazing choice for your wedding. With its convenient location at the crossroads of I-64 and I-75, it has all of the Southern charm you could wish for. Whether your tastes run formal or more casual, you'll find wedding venues in Lexington that are picture perfect - along with vendors who know how to make a wedding extra special.

## Finding the Lexington DJ of Your Dreams

Choosing a wedding DJ may start out low on your priority list but there are a lot of good reasons to move this wedding planning task closer to the top. Lexington DJs do a lot more than just mix music. Whether or not they serve as MC, your wedding DJ will be partially responsible for making your guests feel welcome, setting the mood of your reception, and doing so much more to make sure that each special moment unfolds as planned.

Because the role your wedding DJ will play is so important, it makes sense to start looking sooner rather than later. Expect to pay slightly less than the national average for basic services, though some DJs will charge less and others will charge more - particularly if they offer any kind of extras like video presentations, lighting rigs, or karaoke. Regardless of your wedding budget, you should choose a Lexington DJ who is enthusiastic, energetic, dedicated, and ready to come to your venue with top of the line equipment. The same is true if you're looking for a wedding band.

## Dig Deep to Find Amazing DJs in Lexington

As you reach out to wedding DJs or DJ services in Lexington, it's helpful to have a list of questions ready so you don't miss any key details. You can ask as many questions as you like, but generally you'll want to at least have potential wedding DJs address their availability, pricing, equipment, whether they're familiar with your venue, and how they will handle requests from guests. Always ask for references because you can learn a lot about potential vendors from other couples!

Interviewing plenty of Lexington wedding DJs before settling on one will ensure that you are totally happy with your choices. You can keep track of everyone you speak to in a wedding vendor manager or on a spreadsheet.

## Your Wedding DJ On Your Big Day

Your wedding DJ will do a lot to keep your reception running smoothly. Make sure you tell your DJ what your expectations are beyond music before you sign a contract. It's okay to request that your wedding DJ act as host and announcer, and be responsible for making sure that no one misses out on showcase moments like the cake cutting or the first dance. Ask about add-ons, too, and how much any additional services (like bringing a photobooth) will cost.

WeddingWire can help you find the perfect Lexington wedding DJ as you work through your wedding planning to-do list! Get started with one of our wedding checklists, which lay out all the tasks you'll need to tackle to plan the wedding of your dreams.
