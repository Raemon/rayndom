We used this beautiful venue for our special day and we couldn't have been happier. It is in a great location and has a very rustic feel. The staff was very helpful and made our big day very easy. They help you through the entire process from the planning to the execution and the cleanup. There are a lot of great places for pictures as well. We are very thankful for the staff and their help and we would highly recommend this venue for your big day!

Just had my wedding here a couple of weeks ago and it was absolutely beautiful! The venue is just stunning, the day was beautiful and The Wilds Team did an amazing job with the decor and details. Claire was just phenomenal to work with. The team was professional, I could not have picked a more perfect venue to marry my Husband. This was absolutely one of the best days of our lives. Highly recommend this venue!

Stacey and Sheree at the Crystal Coop are the most caring, hard working, and professional business owners. We had so many questions and requests, but they always responded right away and helped reassure us. They even made special accommodations for us so we could come in and practice our first dance at the venue in advance of our wedding day!!! I apologize, because I can’t remember her name, but the bartender at the Crystal Coop is hands down my favorite of the night. She is so genuine, warm, caring, friendly….I can’t say enough good things. If you want a wedding that is as stress free as possible, while being absolutely beautiful, look no further than the Crystal Coop!!!

This was an incredible choice for our venue. Not only was Kara able to schedule our wedding on a weekday (which they normally only do weekends). The budget was great and she was so accommodating for what we needed for catering (which wasn't a formal caterer) and all the amenities we needed. I definitely recommend this gorgeous venue in heart of Amish country. The lake view for the gazebo ceremony spot was beautiful, and the reception area inside the barn is beautiful!

Rustic Gatherings was an excellent venue. They were kind and courteous. They were prompt in their response, as well as service. They had everything that we could ever need for the place, except for a few things here and there but overall it was a great experience working with them.

The venue was amazing! It is a beautiful place, the Venue is so pretty by itself that it doesn't need too many decorations/flowers to make it look pretty. Working with them was so easy and they understood our wedding vision. On the day of the wedding, they made sure everything was ready for us, they were eager and prepared to help with whatever we needed. It felt like they were invested in our wedding similarly to our families were! We love this place and they made our day feel like a fairy tale.
