We really wanted to find that "spark" that really made our wedding unique so we hired Special Events Mexico/Pyrotech. We cannot describe how SPECTACULAR Hugo and his team made our event! From the 360 photo booth to the fountain of sparks surrounding our first dance, these special effects were the highlights of our entire night! We cannot recommend this team enough!

Minimal Rent was amazing in making our wedding a dream! We got to pick everything from scratch and compared to other vendors, their prices were very reasonable. Would highly recommend Minimal Rent for your furniture & floral needs for your big day!

I cannot say enough wonderful things about MSM Rentals! From start to finish, the entire experience was seamless, professional, and truly exceptional. Montserrat, who I had the pleasure of working with, went above and beyond in every way imaginable. She was incredibly professional, kind, and always prompt in responding to every message and email, which made the entire planning process feel stress-free and fully supported. Their selection of furniture and décor was stunning, their prices were extremely competitive, and a huge bonus was that they also include floral services—which made everything so convenient. The flowers were absolutely exceptional and beautifully designed. When we ran into a hiccup and realized we couldn’t use pampas due to my husband’s allergy, Montserrat and her team shifted gears effortlessly and with complete honesty. In fact, I truly feel the flowers turned out even more beautiful than I originally imagined. MSM Rentals truly helped bring my vision to life and made my wedding day feel like an absolute dream. If you’re looking for a team that genuinely cares, delivers outstanding service, and makes magic happen, MSM Rentals is it. I am endlessly grateful and would recommend them a thousand times over!

The Style Me team worked with our budget and went above and beyond Can't express just how beautiful everything was on our day! We had a Pinterest board and the whole team at Style Me worked to create exactly what I was looking for and they even got creative with little details. I was seriously blown away by how it turned out
