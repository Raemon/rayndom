Everything was amazing. Michelle was so helpful, courteous and super flexible when things came up. It happened to rain that day and she did everything she could to make sure that we were set up for bad weather. The venue is gorgeous, well taken care of and the house on site is as well. We really loved everything about Wild Rose and would definitely go back for other events.

We held our ceremony at the ranch and we're so pleased to work with Michelle. She had lots of great ideas and was very flexible to work with. We booked the ranch after we had already found our reception site, but hosting the reception would have been lovely here as well. I would definitely recommend this venue for the couple looking for a rustic venue.
