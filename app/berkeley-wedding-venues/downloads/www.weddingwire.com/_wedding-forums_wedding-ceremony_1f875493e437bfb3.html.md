Check some of the links under your post. Also, WeddingWire has a list of vendors sorted by location.

Do you need to find the lowest cost venues or just a certain style? Do you have any preferred style that might fit in your budget or that you would prefer? Sometimes the city community centers can host venues. There may be Veterans of Foreign Wars or other groups that may have low cost venues if price is the big concern. But I'm not sure if the VFWs are still around.
