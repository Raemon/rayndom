Ruuben was a pleasure to work with and made our special day truly amazing. Many guests after the wedding kept asking who the DJ was as they were so impressed with the music all night long. Would highly recommend!

Lee was awesome from start to finish! He made time to meet with me on zoom months before the wedding to ease some nerves I had! He assisted with the app as needed which was helpful! We also met again in Aruba to go over final things! He got it all perfect! We are so pleased with his service he had the crowd dancing all night!

Planning with DJ Tino was super easy. We met with him a couple days before the wedding. He went over all the special songs and songs we didn’t want to play. I had a few surprises with my songs that my husband sent to him prior to our arrival. I didn’t know what song my husband picked for our first dance, and I didn’t know what song my dad picked for our father daughter dance, which during that meeting he made sure he didn’t ruin any of those surprises for me. During the wedding, the dance floor was always full, and he always kept the party going. I still get compliments on how great he was.
