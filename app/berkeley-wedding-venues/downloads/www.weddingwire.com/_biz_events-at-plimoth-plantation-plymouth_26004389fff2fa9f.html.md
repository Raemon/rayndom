Truly the best decision we made!

Having our wedding at Plimoth Patuxet was one of the best decisions we made. David was incredibly organized, responsive, and helpful—he answered all my (many!) questions promptly and made the entire planning process effortless.  
  
The garden ceremony site was absolutely stunning and felt so private and intimate—it couldn’t have been more perfect. We’ve received countless compliments on the food, especially the beef short rib, which was a guest favorite!  
  
We’re so grateful to David and his team for going above and beyond to make our day truly seamless and unforgettable.

Dream Wedding!

I can't say enough good things about the team at Plimoth Patuxet. David, Shauna, and the entire Plentiful Events staff were warm, positive, and professional from beginning to end. The Hornblower Garden is truly gorgeous--it feels like you are getting married in a secret garden. The team makes sure that everything runs smoothly and my husband and I didn't have to worry about a thing! The value is also really good for the area. Our guests talked about how much they loved the food and ambiance. Would definitely recommend!

David is the best!! 

Our wedding at Plimoth Patuxet Museum was nothing short of amazing! The venue provided so many unique photo opportunities that captured the essence of New England history and beauty.   
The staff at Plimoth Patuxet, in particular, David, were exceptional. They worked seamlessly with our vendors and ensured that everything ran smoothly from start to finish. They were also very accommodating with our requests and offered helpful suggestions that enhanced the day. The service team was friendly, professional, and truly made us feel like they cared about our experience.  
  
Our guests couldn’t stop raving about the atmosphere and the unique setting. It felt intimate yet spacious, giving everyone room to mingle and explore. It was especially beautiful at sunset, with the warm, rustic vibe adding to the ambiance. The venues historical ambiance combined with modern amenities made it an ideal choice for us.  
  
If you’re looking for a venue that offers both charm and character with professional service, I highly recommend Plimoth Patuxet Museum. It was a dream location for our special day! We wouldn’t have done it without David, and the rest of his staff! Thank you all!!

Forever Grateful

Plimoth Patuxet Museum was the perfect venue for my daughter’s June wedding! The task of hosting a wedding can be daunting; however, David and his staff at Plentiful Catering were outstanding. From our initial visit to the wedding day, David was exceptional with his attention to every detail and service. His expertise and professionalism were superb. We felt at ease throughout the entire planning process. He answered all of our questions with patience and humor. Honestly, we would have been lost without him!  
  
The reception was held at the Peabody Pavilion and it was simply beautiful. In addition to the hydrangeas being in full bloom and the view of the Eel River, guests enjoyed the choice of either joining the dance floor or sitting by the fireplace. The buffett choices were all outstanding. Many guests commented on how good the food was and how much they loved the venue. If you are looking to host a stress free wedding, with a beautiful view and delicious food, look no further than Plimoth Patuxet Museum. You and your guests will be delighted you did!

Absolutely would recommend!!! The venue beautiful! Affordable! Food excellent! 

David Sheehey and all his staff was very easy to work with. Responsive, patient, knowledgeable, pleasant and fun! He made suggestions to make things flow better, was not critical of any ideas, so positive! He provided options to maximize the guest experience while staying within budget constraints. The venue itself was gorgeous! We used the Peabody Pavilion and included the extra tulle and lights on the tent! David lit the patio fireplace which was perfect for photos! So many photo opportunities with the barn, the Hornblower garden, the Eel River in the background. The food was delicious and they were very flexible with guests with dietary restrictions. The outside vendors they recommended were also fantastic! I highly recommend this beautiful venue.

Perfect from start to finish

Even from our first meeting with David, we knew this venue was perfect! He made us feel so at ease through the whole planning process and helped us create the perfect day.   
  
On the day of the wedding, the staff was so unbelievably lovely and attentive to both my husband and I are our guests, serving up incredible food (best vegetarian option I have ever had, I’ve been trying to recreate that acorn squash dish for weeks!) and providing excellent service overall. Our attendant Tabitha was so good to us, bringing us apps during our cocktail hour photos and keeping our food warm while we finished pictures during dinner. We knew our wedding would be great just because the location was so beautiful, but the kindness of the staff brought it to a whole new level! Thank you!

Still on Cloud 9

Staff was a pleasure to work with. Professional, knowledgeable, and experienced in setup, coordination and timing. My daughter's wedding was perfect in every way - every time I looked over she was beaming! The Event Coordinator, David, and his staff made sure that everything came together as we planned and envisioned. We had a stress-free day. It was truly perfect- we wouldn't have changed a thing!

Best venue 

The plimoth patuxet was by far the best venue we looked at during our venue hunt. The 2 venue areas they offer were absolutely stunning. The management staff at the facility were unmatched and carried the highest level of professionalism and kindness through our entire wedding planning process. David the sales manager was one of the best people we encountered during our wedding planning experience. This venue went above and beyond to lay out everything they offer and make your big day go off without a hitch. They have it down to a true science of planning and presenting the most beautiful venue possible. Every one of our guests was blown away with the beauty and ease the staff and venue provided. When shopping around for wedding venues we saw how easy it was for the price to rise. The package that the plimoth patuxet offers was by far the most “bang for your buck” and affordable. This venue deserves 10 stars for how amazing they were to work with and the beauty it has to offer.

A big thanks to David and the Plimoth Patuxet Team!

My husband and I got married at Plimoth Patuxet on August 3 and we cannot thank David and his team enough for the seamless process and personable experience we had. David made this past 9 months of planning so streamlined for us, especially since we did most of the planning virtually as I am currently living in Canada. They partner with top line vendors in the area that know the space so well (shout out to Kevin, Ryan, DJMaggs, JN Floral Design, Berry Photos). Awesome team of people who all communicate professionally and clearly are passionate about what they do. I can actually say i am sad that the process is over, largely because of the partnerships we cultivated with the vendors. A special mention to David, our day of coordinate and the event coordinator at the venue. David is truly one of the most lovely people I have met. He is thorough, thoughtful, personable, professional, and he makes you feel like one of a kind. Thank you David for all that you do, the glowing reviews about him are all true- can confirm!

Gorgeous setting with wonderful staff

David and his team made the wedding planning process as low stress as possible from start to finish. They ensured our wedding day went seamlessly and we truly felt like guests of honor. From helping us coordinate having our two dogs walk down the aisle to tracking us down during dinner to ensure we were able to eat, no task was too big or small. It is obvious they have done countless weddings and seen it all so it was easy to put our trust in them and they ensured we had a perfect day. Our guests complimented us on the gorgeous setting, great food, friendly bartenders, and excellent service all around. We are so appreciative of everyone at Plimouth Patuxet! Thank you for the best experience!
