If I could give a million stars to Shawna and the team at Mama MIa's I would. They were absolutely the best caterers at our wedding and for our rehearsal dinner location. We decided on Mexican food for rehearsal dinner, thats right Mexican food at Mama Mia's, outside in the beautiful patio area. It was delicious and service was excellent.   
The wedding catering service was more than amazing. Shawna was so organized and her team was so helpful, quick and smooth service. Buffett line went quick and everyone was happy. I cannot tell you how many guests have complimented on our food, from the appetizers to the entree. All of the food was amazing. Pesto Cheese tortellini, bruschetta, sausage wraps. OMG, I dream about that amazing meal!  
Mama Mia's was affordable, professional, and the food was amazing. We shopped around and got many quotes for large dollar amounts. We were dreading having to pay so much for just the food. We felt so lucky when we found our venue and they recommended Mama Mia's. They have different levels for all different budgets and they go above and beyond what you would expect. Shawna and her team contributed huge to how smooth our wedding went. They even brought appetizers out to our wedding party pictures so we didn't miss anything!  
Don't waste your time looking anywhere else. Hire Mama Mia's and you are sure to have perfect, memorable, and amazing food and service.

Shawna is amazing! I had millions of questions and I must have sent her 200 emails from the time we met until the day of. She was always super responsive and polite! We had some family drama which caused us to change the date of our wedding. I was absolutely devastated, but Shawna made it happen. That was when it hit me, that we had literally made the best decision picking Mama Mia's to get married. She was there on the evening of our rehearsal dinner to help us go through everything and because of the weather she even had different plans set up so that our day would be special no matter what. I expressed to her how badly we wanted everything outside and she made it happen! Oh god did she! It was absolutely beautiful and everything we hoped it would be PLUS more! She put everything together for us from the centerpieces to laying out the favors and even stayed to make sure everything was packed up. We didn't have to do a thing. She made it so effortless for us and it was such a relief because as a bride there is no such thing as effortless. The food was amazing, we picked all of our favorites to be served to our guests! Shawna even made sure someone saved us a plate of apps and brought them to us to sneak during our family pictures (because we were tied up all of our cocktail hour). She paid attention to every detail and listened so well to how I imagined the day going. My husband and I were so grateful for her! We had to get a picture so that we would always remember her and when we asked her to take a picture with us she was seriously crying! OMG!! Love you Shawna!! Thank you for making all of our dreams come true! We initially picked this place because of the cute outdoor patio (literally so gorgeous at night with all of the lights), the intimate setting (we were planning a smaller wedding ~90 guests) and the price point. I will not be able to thank Mama Mia's enough for making our day so special!!!

Wonderful experience. Shawna made the whole catering aspect of our daughter's wedding so effortless and easy. She is very professional and did a beautiful presentation of the food. She was very accommodating, had great suggestions, and worked easily with our coordinator to ensure everything went smoothly. I can't say enough good things about using Mama Mia's and highly recommend them. They are a real find and give you an amazing experience. A real value for your money.

The event coordinator, Shawna, was great to work with. Her humor was infectious. She had great ideas as to the food choices and took into consideration the age span from infant to grandparent. Service was excellent! Shawna not only supplied us with a server and buser, but, several times throughout the party came over to check that everything was going well. I will recommend Mama Mia's to everyone and especially recommend, Shawna.

We were very pleased with Shawna from start to finish in how she and the staff worked with us in planning our event all the way through execution on the day of the wedding. Shawna worked with us to make a great event for us and our guests and never made us feel that we were spending more than we were comfortable with. Several guests commented on the attentiveness of the staff and the good food.

We used Mama Mia's as the caterer for our wedding at Kirigin Cellars (they are a preferred vendor for Kirigin), and we also had our rehearsal lunch there the day before (at the Morgan Hill restaurant).   
The food for both meals was solid--we had their BBQ for the rehearsal (ribs were delicious!) and their Italian buffet for the wedding reception. I would say the food was good but not 'gourmet'.   
Where Mama Mia's really shines is their value (very cost effective for what you get) and their service.   
Shawna, the catering manager, is incredibly on top of things. We also hired her as our day-of coordinator for the wedding, which she will discount if Mama Mia's does the catering, and it was the most valuable money we spent for the entire wedding. She was responsive via email and really aware of everything goes on and what needed doing, and was great about coordination set up and break down the day of. She and the rest of her staff were all friendly, organized, and on top of everything.

I came to me you to discuss my dinner menu and really did not get the service I had expected. I would have liked suggestions, samples etc but none were offered and you were busy running your kids around. I could not get a commitment on the patio until Broomster's came in the picture. I really had a hard time communicating with you on the details and seems like I was working with a Denny's level manager instead of and event planner. That being said, the dinner was fabulous and the wait staff could not have been more professional and I was really happy with the evening. I would suggest you could set up a meeting with clients and give them more of a personal touch. Offer an appetizer platter so we could have sampled what was offered before we needed to make a choice. Also you always seem to forget my cell phone number which I gave many times.
