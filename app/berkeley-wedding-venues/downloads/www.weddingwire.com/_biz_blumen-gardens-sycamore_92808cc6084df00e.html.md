Highly recommend!!! Thank you for everything Blumen Gardens!

We could not have asked for a more beautiful, seamless venue than Blumen Gardens! Planning our wedding without a wedding planner was definitely overwhelming at first, but once we found Blumen, it really felt like everything started to fall into place. From the moment we visited, we knew it was the one, the garden was already so beautiful that we didn’t feel the need to add anything more.   
  
One of the biggest things we appreciated was how they allowed outside catering, which gave us the freedom to choose what we wanted for the food. On top of this, the indoor reception space was already decorated with beautiful string lights and had that perfect rustic charm we were looking for.  
  
The team at Blumen was amazing to work with. Britney was so kind, responsive, and accommodating from the beginning, always willing to answer our (many) questions. As our guest counts changed, she and the team were so flexible and worked closely with us to help adjust the layout and plans. They even offered rentals for signage and decor (which we honestly wish we had used more of instead of buying our own!).  
  
Blumen Gardens also made it easy for us to stay organized. Even without an official wedding planner, they provided clear timelines for when they needed info like our schedule, vendor contacts, layout, and rehearsal details. On the day of the wedding, Alyssa, Bridget, and the rest of the Blumen team were everywhere making sure everything ran smoothly. Their presence and support gave us so much peace of mind.  
  
The entire day felt like a dream come true, and we’re so thankful to the team at Blumen Gardens for helping bring our dream wedding vision to life. Also, their off-season discounts helped us stay on budget, and they never pressured us into using their rentals or bar services. If you're looking for a venue that’s naturally beautiful, flexible, & staffed with kind people who truly care; Blumen Gardens is it!!

Dream Venue at first sight!

Got engaged in July of 2021 and started planning about a week after. I was SO excited. Downloaded wedding wire and started looking at venues to secure a date. Blumen Gardens was the first venue I saw and was immediately in love! From the industrial garden aesthetics to the inside rustic chandelier reception hall. I mean it is so unique and beautiful my husband and I were amazed! We couldn’t get a time to see it for 3 weeks or so since it was so busy post Covid and saw several other venues. They were all nice but once we got to see Blumen in person, there was no question it was the one. Bridget and Brittany are so helpful with any questions. They were patient, resourceful and even helped plan a layout for us for reception. Bridget is a coordinating Goddess! And Brittany! Omg Brittany, my wedding day would have probably been so so stressful without your help. You are a saint and so helpful and just enthusiastic in every way to help! Seriously owe you everything. You won’t be disappointed with this venue. Gorgeous outdoor ceremony space, cocktail hour courtyard and conveyor room. They have game rentals as well. The bridal suite is GORGEOUS!! Truly blessed to have found Blumen.

BEST Venue ever

My wife and I fell in love with this venue the second we seen it. The staff there is amazing and helped us with everything we needed and more! At the reception we got so many people coming up to us and telling us how beautiful the venue is. Everyone, I mean everyone enjoyed themselves.   
  
Thank you again Blumen Gardens for making our wedding truly amazing.   
  
Love always,   
Mandi and Nicky Corbett

Top Notch Staff & Beautiful Venue

Blumen Gardens is not only a beautiful venue, but what really knocks it out of the park is their AMAZING staff.   
  
Helpful, professional and kind are just a handful of words I would use to describe the team at Blumen.   
  
Being a vendor and working at many different venues, this was one of the best experiences to date. Thank you for making everything better!

Beautiful indoor and outdoor space

I struggled to find a venue that had a gorgeous outdoor space along with a pretty indoor space…until I found Blumen Gardens. It is such a unique space that my fiancé and I completely fell in love with. Every single area looks amazing in photos. Like others said, you have to find your own vendors, but they give you a list in case you want suggestions. I like this because then you have full control of all the costs. (I highly recommend Nats on Maple for food! It’s just 0.5 miles away) The bridal suite is made up of 3 huge rooms to get ready in which was so perfect. All in all, they truly thought of everything! I 100% recommend.

Beautiful Venue with Wonderful Staff!

We had the best experience as vendors at Blumen Gardens! Not only is it a beautiful venue both inside and out, with several picture perfect areas for ceremonies and receptions, but the staff is reason enough alone to book this as your wedding venue. Bridget, Aubri, and everyone at Blumen Gardens were so helpful and friendly. We can't recommend Blumen Gardens enough!

A dream venue!

Blumen Gardens is a dream venue for an incredibly reasonable price. The staff is so friendly and accommodating and you can feel how much love and care Joel and Joan Barczak have put into the space. We really liked that you are able to utilize every part of the venue; from the outdoor garden area to the brand new bridal suite. The courtyard was the perfect back drop for our September wedding and the reception area is equally as stunning. You do not need a lot of decor or extras here because the space is already decorated so beautifully. I've visited Blumen during every season and every season offers a unique and breath taking look. You will not regret hosting your event here. Choosing Blumen Gardens was the easiest decision my husband and I made while wedding planning and I would choose it over and over again. Our guests are still talking about how much they loved our venue. I cannot say enough good things and know that you will love Blumen Gardens as much as we did.

Best rustic boho wedding venue

Blumen Gardens was the PERFECT venue for our rustic boho wedding. We would give Blumen Gardens 10 stars if we could! First off, it was the very first and the very last venue my husband and I toured. We knew immediately from the charming aesthetic that we wanted to get married here.   
  
The greenery and flowers around are the perfect backdrop - we didn't even hire a florist because of all the beautiful plants and natural beauty the venue offers. We opted to rent the new bridal suite which was absolutely STUNNING and big enough to allow even the largest bridal party room to get ready and celebrate. They even supplied us with 2 bottles of champagne, orange juice, and snacks.   
  
We had an outdoor ceremony that required little to no decor on our end. The space itself is beautiful and we wanted to be married in the raw beauty of the space. It needs nothing else other than what Blumen Gardens supplies. So many places for stunning pictures.  
  
My husband and I were on a specific budget and we were able to spend under that because Blumen Gardens allows you to bring in your own vendors. This allows you to spend as much or as little as you want on catering, bar, DJ, cake, etc.  
  
The reception area was climate controlled perfectly for our early August wedding. The twinkly lights and charming chandeliers around the reception space made our wedding warm, inviting, and gave it a fantastical feel. We loved the vintage wall decor, bar, and hutch that we used to display our decor on.  
  
Above all else, Bridget, the events coordinator was an absolute miracle worker and THE BEST AND EASIEST PERSON TO WORK WITH!!!! Throughout our 2 year engagement, she answered every question we could possibly have promptly and with patience. She helped create a timeline of the day, and a floor plan for the reception. The day of, she helped set up our outdoor decor and made sure everything was perfect. Bridget and her team directed vendors the day of, and also helped our bridal party get down the aisle - because of this, we didn't even need a rehearsal dinner! She was PARAMOUNT for a successful day and we owe her and the entire Blumen Gardens team so much for making our dream wedding possible. It was magical :)

A dream come true

My husband and I had our dream wedding at Blumen Gardens just a few weeks ago. So many of our guests complimented the beautiful venue, and cocktail hour in the gardens was a big hit. From getting ready in the beautiful new bridal suite, to our first look in the conveyor room, to our ceremony in the courtyard, to dancing the night away in the reception space, this venue was everything we could have asked for. We loved working with one of the wedding coordinators, Bridget, and she was very flexible as we had to replan our wedding date due to COVID, and then manage a rainy forecast the day-of. I would highly recommend Blumen Gardens to any couple. :) Another huge plus is that you really don't need to spend much on decor or florals. I made DIY centerpieces, but just a few candles or a nice vase would be enough with all of the natural ambiance and greenery in the space (both inside and out).
