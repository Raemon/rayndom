We hosted our October 2023 Wedding Ceremony at Hakone and we were so happy with the beautiful gardens and overall experience. The staff at Hakone (Tony and Melia) were extremely helpful, friendly, and easy to work with and they went above and beyond to make sure our rehearsal and ceremony went smoothly. We requested a unique setup with two aisles and we had a large decoration to attach to an arch we rented through a vendor, and they worked with both us and our vendors to make sure that everything was set up just right with plenty of time to spare. They also helped us work through all the important details of the ceremony without being overwhelming, and they did a perfect job executing on the actual ceremony, queuing our party to walk and managing the music and sound system. The garden itself is beautiful in any season. We visited multiple times throughout the year leading up to our wedding and enjoyed different plants in bloom every time. In October, the garden was still lush and green with redwoods, bamboo, and the Koi pond providing amazing variety. Our guests had a great time strolling through the gardens before and after the ceremony, and there were tons of amazing backdrops for our wedding photos. They even gave us a complimentary year-long membership following our wedding so we could come back to relive the memories! In summary, we highly recommend Hakone whether for a wedding ceremony or just a visit!

If I had do it all over again, I would do it exactly the same! It was a dream come true to have our wedding reception at Fort Mason and I'm so thankful to have had Shawn and the whole team at Fort Mason to assist with our wedding day. The venue is beautiful and all of our guests were stunned by the view and location.

I would definitely recommend this venue. The staff was super sweet, always responded super quickly (sometimes at night too!) and were super great about making sure we were on track with deadlines. They recommended us bakeries and DJ services, so the planning process was a lot more streamlined and less stress for us. Chrissy was absolutely amazing as a coordinator, she was open to whatever we wanted and made sure we had the best wedding possible. We had an absolutely amazing wedding, food was great and all the Wedgewood recommended vendors were great. Definitely recommend!!

We cannot recommend Emily and Janciz at City Club enough! They truly were the dream team that made our wedding experience completely stress-free and enjoyable, both during the planning process and on the big day. From our very first consultation, they were incredibly organized, proactive, and responsive. Planning a wedding can be overwhelming, but Emily and Janciz were always ten steps ahead, ensuring every detail was covered well in advance. Their level of professionalism and expertise was immediately apparent. We had to go back and forth on the Banquet Event Order many times because some things we thought would be fun to add (lamb shanks, french fry station, etc.) ended up compounding in price with surcharges and taxes. But, they were very willing to help us with our requests. They made us feel completely supported and heard throughout the entire journey. On the day of the wedding, everything ran flawlessly. They were constantly on top of every detail, allowing us to relax and fully immerse ourselves in the celebration. City Club is a beautiful venue, but Emily and Janciz are the incredible people who truly bring the experience to life. If you are considering City Club, you are in the best hands possible with Janciz!

We hosted our wedding at the Presidio Officers' Club and had truly the most special, incredible day of our lives. It was clean, well-organized, with delicious food and friendly staff. Not to mention, the planning team at the Presidio, through Wedgewood Weddings, was truly best-in-class. Wedgewood prepared us so well, providing a planning binder and step-by-step instructions. They checked in with us multiple times: providing walk-throughs, and answering every question extremely promptly. We especially loved our planner and day-of coordinator, Christian, who went out of his way to make everything so seamless. Christian taught us how to do our ceremony, including little details such as hand placement, went out of his way to accommodate a creative painting engagement, and provided private time for us newlyweds. He was perfect! So grateful to this beautiful venue and our wonderful team. We will treasure our experience with Wedgewood forever.

This spot worked out great for our rehearsal dinner, as we were looking for something hip and different and local in character. We rented out space at the chapel's vestry restaurant for our rehearsal dinner for 50 people. Originally we were going to have it out on the patio but it got moved because of rain inside to the chapel bar. The events manager helping us coordinate, Patricia Gums, was helpful off the bat, and the Vestry customized a menu and the space to exactly what we wanted. Everyone had a good time and the rehearsal dinner turned into a bar evening with out-of-town friends, without having to move. Check it out.

I recently had the pleasure of hosting my reception at the Hibernia in San Francisco, and I cannot speak highly enough of my experience with them. From start to finish, they were an absolute delight to work with. First and foremost, the team at the Hibernia was incredibly responsive and attentive to our needs. They listened carefully to our vision for the event and went above and beyond to ensure that every detail was executed flawlessly. Our guests were in awe as they were greeted with valet, walked up the red carpet, and entered into this beautiful interior enhanced by Jason's amazing light work. One aspect that truly stood out was their accommodation of our ideas. They not only welcomed our creative input but also provided valuable suggestions and guidance to enhance our vision even further. It was evident that they were genuinely invested in making our event memorable and unique. Moreover, the Hibernia proved to be the easiest vendor to work with throughout the entire planning process. Their professionalism, efficiency, and proactive approach made the experience stress-free and enjoyable. I also want to commend the Hibernia for their commitment to helping us stick to our budget. They offered cost-effective solutions without compromising on quality or service. This level of transparency and integrity was truly refreshing and greatly appreciated. Additionally, our other vendors echoed our sentiments and expressed how much they enjoyed collaborating with the Hibernia team. Their seamless coordination and teamwork contributed to the overall success of the event. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend the Hibernia to anyone seeking a venue for their special occasion. Their responsiveness, accommodation, encouragement of ideas, and dedication to staying within budget set them apart as a top-notch establishment in the industry. Thank you to the entire team at the Hibernia for making our reception an unforgettable experience! Decor by: @specialmomentsdecorr

We couldn't be happier having our wedding at the University Club in April 2023. The moment we met Yvonne we knew that the University Club was the right venue for us. She is so friendly, knowledgeable and relatable. We knew that she was going to make our wedding wonderful with as little stress to us! Yvonne handled everything with ease and worked so well with our other vendors so our wedding day went flawlessly. Everyone at the University Club is so friendly and accommodating. The head bartender met with me the day before the wedding to make sure everything was perfect and she made sure I had a drink in my hand all night. The front desk staff are so helpful and made our guests feel welcome all weekend. Our guests still talk about the delicious food they had. The appetizers are amazing and the prime rib/salmon station was a huge hit. My personal favorite was the mushroom ravioli, we want to come back just for that ravioli! Everything is made onsite so the food is hot and timed perfectly with the evening. Being a more all inclusive site saved us so much hassle, not needing to worry about rentals and additional vendors showing up on time. Knowing they've done this so many times saved so much anxiety! For being an upscale venue in the heart of San Francisco, they are a very reasonably priced wedding venue, with no hidden fees at the end! Pick the University Club and dazzle your guests with delicious food and stunning views of San Francisco!

This place was beautiful. We got so many compliments about how great a venue it was and how we even found it. Patty Flax was amazing and very accommodating with all our needs. It’s a must see in person. There are some limitations that can be tricky, like transportation. There is no parking. And guests must be shuttled.
