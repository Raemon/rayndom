Gorgeous & guest-friendly space!

We are so happy we had our ceremony at the Museum of Fine Arts! It is an absolutely gorgeous space with endless options for stunning photos. The staff were so kind and easy to work with and everything went off without a hitch. Our guests commented on how beautiful it was and many of them enjoyed exploring the galleries and eating at the cafe before the ceremony began. The space is also accessible, well air conditioned and allows you to get great natural light while staying out of the hot Florida sun. This helped us maintain a good guest experience, which was important to us. Thank you for helping our day feel so special, moving and fun!

Most Beautiful Wedding Venue 

The most beautiful venue in downtown St Pete, I am so thrilled with our wedding there! It was in a perfect location for easy accessible from the hotels and beautiful backdrop. We did our ceremony in the membership garden, cocktail hour on the terrace & then the reception in the large main room. The different areas each provided an incredible space and our guests loved it! The museum was really easy to work with and SO many of the vendors know what looks great and all of the rules. There are a few things to consider like you must use their caterer and there is limited parking and some restrictions of what you can have, but none of that really impacts the vision of the day but good to be aware of if there is something really important to you. I would also factor the catering requirement into your budget so that you know before you sign with the museum. Also make sure you pay attention to the chairs in the contract, because you will need to add them into your catering contract depending on the room you pick! Would 100% recommend, it was such a beautiful and special venue!!

A dream venue!

We could not have chosen a more perfect venue for our wedding!!! At the beginning, I spoke with Sooky to secure our date. She was responsive and helpful throughout the whole process. And the required catering vendor, Olympia, is top notch!! We had several guests say it was the best wedding food they had ever had!   
  
We had our ceremony in the Membership Garden, cocktail hour in the Sculpture Garden, and reception in the Marly Room . . . and it was truly a dream. With an initial guest count of 125, I was worried that the space would be a little tight - we ended up with 110 but there would have been plenty of room even if all 125 had attended! I am also so glad we chose the Marly Room for the reception over the Conservatory. With the chandeliers and the gold mirrors, the room gave the event a whimsical and romantic feel. The venue has so many interesting spots for photos, and we loved having everything at the same location so guests did not have to travel to the reception. I cannot recommend this venue enough!

11-12-22 wedding: From the perspective of the Mother of the Bride

The building and courtyards and art exhibits are impressive all on their own, but the STAFF (Brittany, Jeremy, everyone) made this venue a true “fairytale” for my daughter’s wedding this past weekend!!! It’s a magical place!!!💕

Wedding of our dreams

The perfect venue for what we were looking for. We were married under the banyan trees, had cocktail hour on the terrace and our reception in the conservatory. It was the perfect day.

My guests raved about the venue - I wanted an outdoor wedding & picked this spot because their indoor space was also gorgeous. It rained on my wedding day so I was soooo happy with my decision because i had to move indoors & everything was still absolutely beautiful!

Amazing!!! 

We LOVED everything for our wedding, especially under the circumstances; a rainy day forced relocation indoors following an inclement weather contingency plan. Everything was just perfect - unquestionably the finest venue and services in Saint Petersburg!!! Nancy is the best!

Perfect venue

I found this place after months of searching, countless appointments and a different venue contract that didn’t work out. The MFA was my lifesaver. It had everything I wanted, a garden to get married in and a large room for dancing with floor to ceiling windows looking over the water. We couldn’t get the date I wanted but had to push it back by 2 weeks which actually worked out even better since they decorated for Christmas and it just made everything more magical. I’ve gotten so many compliments for choosing the MFA it was a perfect choice.

Amazing Venue & Amazing Team!

I got married here on 12/7/19 and everything was flawless. My guests were so impressed with the venue and my day-of-coordinator Nancy Cotto, the Museum's Catering Sales Manager, made my day perfect and stress-free. Even though she technically only had charge over thee "day of" details, she was there with me every step of the way. She promptly answered all of my questions and also recommended my photographer, DJ, and florist who were all equally fabulous. All this to say, I highly recommend this venue and the Olympia catering team.
