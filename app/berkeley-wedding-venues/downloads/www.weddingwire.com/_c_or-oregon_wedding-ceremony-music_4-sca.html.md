My daughter asked me for help to organize and coordinate the music for her wedding's prelude and ceremony and I knew, from the very first e-mail I exchanged with Alistair, that I had made the right choice. The repertoire they offered us had all the pieces of music (from classical to rock) we wanted to have, and when we asked for one piece that was exclusive for a quartet, they were able to make the arrangements to be played as Trio. Andrew, Erik and Alistair were extremely punctual and followed the timing and cues during the wedding and their performance was just... amazing. My sincere thank you VSQ(Trio) you exceeded by far our expectations

The quartet's music was exquisite. The director of the group, Paloma, was responsive to what we wanted to quartet to play, gave us suggestions, and both ordered music, with the help of the music librarian, in addition to their excellent repertoire. We couldn't have been happier with the atmosphere the quartet provided. The music was an integral part of our rehearsal dinner.

I was the wedding planner for a wedding The House of Cards did in May 2022. I found them excellent to communicate with before the wedding. On the day, the assigned musicians arrived on-time and were a breeze to work with (beyond being very talented). I highly recommend The House of Cards and hope to work together again soon.

I would highly recommend Anela for an event. She was very good about keeping the lines of communication open leading up to the wedding, and was very friendly and professional. I liked that she asked us about what kind of music we wanted and when, and even offered to do some arrangements ahead of time. She even took it upon herself to arrive before the ceremony to coordinate with the minister. We were thrilled to have her at our ceremony! -- Jeff P., Dallas, TX.
