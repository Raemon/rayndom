⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐!! Lois is a ONE OF A KIND!!! A treasured work of art, more meaningful than photos, that guests won't be able to stop talking about!!

Lois went above and beyond to make our day so special. She made everything incredibly easy and was very communicative throughout the entire process to make sure every detail was perfect. As a bride there were so many things I was worried about leading up to and on the wedding day but Lois truly made me feel at ease every step of the way. She was very responsive pre wedding, completely present the day of our wedding- ready to celebrate us, initiated conversation with our photographer on getting the best shot without delaying our timeline, and went above and beyond to provide not just a service but entertainment and connection as well. Watching her canvas go from blank to the heirloom worthy piece of art (we now have hanging above our bed) is something our friends and family are still talking about! Not only does Lois capture your day in ways that photos can't, she also brings such an incredibly delightful presence along with her talent. We feel so lucky to have a Lois Sprague original in our home!

Amazing Art From An Amazing Artist

If you want to add a unique touch to your big day that results in a beautifully personal keepsake, look no further! Lois doesn’t just capture likeness. She’s able to capture the feeling of the day, and that feeling is bursting from the painting. Every time I look at ours, I’m brought right back to that special moment. Not only is Lois very professional and easy to work with, she’s also fun and she cares! I could not recommend her art and service enough.

Above and beyond!

Lois was able to capture my husband and I like I’ve never experienced before. She was not o not able to capture us in a timely manner, but you see our love and personalities shine through in our portrait. We chose to have Lois paint a photo of our engagement and I love that there were options. I will definitely be hiring her again for my family portraits in the future and recommending to everyone.

It’s like magic

Having Lois Rosio Sprague at my daughter’s wedding was such a gift. Her live painting added a layer of beauty and magic to the day that we will never forget. Guests were fascinated as they watched the picture unfold on her canvas, and Lois captured the joy, love, and spirit of the celebration in the most meaningful way. The finished painting is not only a gorgeous work of art, but also a timeless keepsake that we’ll cherish for generations. Lois’s talent and gracious presence made her an unforgettable part of the wedding.
