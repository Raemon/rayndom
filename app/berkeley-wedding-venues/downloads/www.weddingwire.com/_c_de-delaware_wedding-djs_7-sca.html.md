Bottom Line Up Front: Book these guys. Reasonable price, great value, fantastic music, MCing, dancing and lighting. They say that a DJ makes or breaks your wedding, and in the case of Don and D&J DJ Service, it is clear they MADE the wedding. Don met with us before the wedding to understand the vibe we were going for, and we gave him a simple instruction "we do not want any of the guests to be able to leave the dance floor because the music is too good." And boy, did Don deliver. Don provided the speakers and music we selected for the ceremony, easily transitioned to the reception, and set the mood at all points of the Wedding. The up lighting really enhanced the experience. The speeches were clear with Don's equipment, and as soon as the dance floor opened, we could not leave. Back to back bangers. Even when slow songs came on and some people left the floor, Don knew how to get them right back on the dance floor. By the end of the night, we had multiple people ask for Don's name so they could book him for their wedding. He was worth every penny and more. I highly recommend him, or anyone in his company, to DJ and MC whatever event you have coming up.

We had a blast with Andrew and Lab Mix Media! He kept everyone moving and smiling throughout the evening. He played what we wanted to hear, was flexible with requests, and was a professional from start to finish. Hopefully, we are only doing this once and we are so happy Andrew was there to keep the party going!

As a wedding planner, I’ve had the pleasure of working with many DJs over the years, but DJ Sdot truly stands out every single time! His professionalism is unmatched, his energy is contagious, and the way he connects with guests is always on point. You can tell he genuinely loves what he does. He reads the room, keeps the crowd engaged, and makes every moment feel unique. And he’s not just the DJ standing behind the booth. Every wedding we’ve worked together, at some point or another he has made his way out to the dance floor where he is either busting a move or teaching guests the latest line dances. That’s the kind of energy and passion that keeps the celebration going all night long! If you’re looking for a DJ who doesn’t just play music but creates an experience, I highly recommend DJ Sdot. He brings the perfect blend of fun, personality, and professionalism every single time. — Jasmine Walker, The Koordinator

Dj Rupe made my daughters wedding day. A DJ is not only about the music but the MC for a very important day! DJ Rupe kept the evening moving and the guests on the dance floor. He ran music during the ceremony and also in the reception hall without missing a beat! I would recommend him to anyone. You will not be dissapointed!

We had a great experience with Will and Norma. They came recommended by friends who had previously hired them for their wedding in 2017 and they did not disappoint! The ceremony music was exactly what we asked for and the dance floor at the reception was constantly occupied. Definitely recommend them!!

Dave Skocik: Vic, Beyond your expertise in video work and hosting parties, your corporate work is on target. At the annual Small Business Administration award dinner in Claymont, where music was so important to keep the event moving and upbeat, you were on cue, on time, and on tempo!

Kurt knew how to get the guests off their feet and dancing prior to the wedding, and had a consultation a few weeks before to make sure we got every song we wanted played. They took requests throughout the night, as well. He offers a few different packages, making sure to get everything you need, even officiating your wedding! He was always quick to respond and answered any questions we had. Highly recommend Kurt for you entertainment needs!
