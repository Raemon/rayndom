Beautiful venue

The Courtyard was such beautiful venue for our wedding reception. When you book the venue, you have access to so many things like tables, chairs and Gayle’s wonderful collection of decorations. To say that Gayle was amazing is an understatement. She was so easy to work with. As soon as we met with her, we knew that the Courtyard was the place for us. She was so caring and made us feel like making our wedding day the most beautiful day of our lives was her #1 priority. Gayle welcomes outside vendors and has a great list of recommendations as well. My family absolutely loves the venue and Gayle and want to have as many events at the Courtyard as we possibly can.

The best experience

The coordinator Gayle, is the best. She makes sure to work with my planner and to give exactly what I wanted. Last minute had to move locations due to unpredictable California weather. But she made sure it all came out amazing.

Exceeded our expectations

I cannot say enough good things about Dove Canyon and Gayle White. I strongly recommend this venue for your wedding or any event. Not only is it a beautiful and well-maintained property with everything you need for a successful wedding, you get Gayle along with it. She is probably one of the sweetest, most accommodating, most passionate, and most caring humans my husband and I have ever encountered. She is available for Day Of Coordination services (a Day Of Coordinator is required for a wedding here), and we DEFINITELY recommend using her services. She is professional, experienced, and truly wants you to love your wedding. Fantastic venue, amazing and EASY experience, definitely the best value for a wedding venue in probably all of Orange County.

Blown away!

This is the most beautiful venue I have ever seen and even more beautiful at night. Gayle who is the coordinator there is the most amazing person, she will help with anything you need and you can tell she puts her whole heart into making it a special day. Our wedding was perfect, everything we wanted. It was such a magical experience that I will remember for the rest of my life. As will the guests who couldn't and still can't stop talking about it. I recommend this place to anyone looking to get married in a completely breathtaking place with so much love.

I love the Dove Canyon Courtyard! Gayle and her team are absolutely exceptional at what they do. The venue is stunning and they provide a GORGEOUS tent in the case of rain. As a wedding planner, I work with new venues almost every weekend, and this team really has it together. I would highly suggest taking a visit there to see it yourself, you'll fall in love right away. As a side note, Jerry the DJ (who is included in the package) was fantastic and incredibly professional as well. He brought in his photobooth and the guests loved it and the attendants.

Dove canyon courtyard was the best find. The venue is affordable and beautiful. The fact that you can select your own caterer makes it even more customizable. Gayle, the venue coordinator, is extremely helpful and knowledgeable, she was always available for questions and helpful suggestions. I definitely recommend this venue to anyone.

Quality of Service: Excellent, Gayle ( Dove Canyon Courtyard's coordinator) is AMAZING. She is so passionate about working at this venue and she really cares about all her brides. ( I'm not just saying that.) I truly felt like she really cared about me and she helped me find some of the vendors I had (which were able to work with my budget.) I am so glad that we went with this hidden gem, Dove Canyon Courtyard.   
  
Responsiveness: Whenever I emailed Gayle, she was quick to respond to me. She knows the venue so well and was always able to give me the best suggestions whenever I inquired.   
  
Professionalism: Gayle and her staff are very professional. The day of the wedding, it went very smooth. If something didn't go according to plan, I have no idea and didn't notice it. My wedding at this venue was stress free! I had such a fun time.   
  
Value: Where in Orange county can you find a venue that allows outside catering AND allows you to bring in your own ALCOHOL. I mean seriously, this is awesome. Aside from this venue being gorgeous, the fact that we could bring our own alcohol and our own catering here is one of the big reasons that we went with this venue.   
  
Flexibility: Before the wedding, Gayle was always an email away. She always had good communication. The day of the wedding, Gayle was like wonderwoman, always making sure things were running smoothly.   
  
Venue: It's so pretty! They have a beautiful canopy certain months out of the year. Their Dj, Jerry is such a good MC/DJ. We played the newly wed game (AKA: shoe game, shoe-ly wed game.) This game was such a hit!   
  
My wedding day (March 2016) was so much fun and went by so quick. I got so many compliments on how pretty the venue was and how much fun they had AND how smooth everything went! I'm so glad we went with this hidden gem!   
  
Thank you Gayle for everything, you're the best!

I feel as though there aren't enough positive words in the English language to express how wonderful our wedding was and it was due in part for the beautiful courtyard and it's amazing staff. Gayle White is the hard-working Coordinator for the courtyard who from our first phone call was the most wonderful woman caring and loving and willing to go above and beyond to make our day as special as it was in our minds, and she truly did just that. It was a fantasy, she managed to wrangle all of our guess that didn't feel they needed to follow any sort of directions and all of our vendors that were coming from all of the place. We are young couple on a very tight budget and she was able to give us suggestions and hints to keep on the budget and always made sure to put our needs, wants and dreams first.  
I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the courtyard. From the moment we stepped through the gate we knew that this was the perfect setting for our dream wedding but what really made it was the amazing staff and unlike most places the feeling that they really want to make your dreams come true. Our wedding was stress free and truly the best day of our live  
Every single aspect about our wedding was perfect, the DJ worked tirelessly with us to create the perfect playlist that had me dancing all night and did a wonderful job of rallying people to the dance floor as well as setting the mood for the entire night. He too went above and beyond.  
I could never repay all these wonderful people for all that they did for myself and my husband on this day so I will leave it at this, the courtyard is a wonderful place to get married, and thank you so much Gayle and all of your staff for all of your support and for making our dreams come true. If there's anything we can ever do please let us know. Thanks again for the most wonderful day of our lives, and please know that we noticed and appreciated all of your hard work down to the most small details and we thank you for that.

I cannot start to express the gratitude that I have for Gayle at Dove Canyon Courtyard. She was amazing from the moment we first stepped into the venue site and until she whisked us off in our limo. She went beyond what we all expected. She catered to my every request and made sure I was stress free. She even decorated!!! The venue is/was absolutely beautiful. It is a hidden gem and Gayle is just the person you would absolutely fall in love with! The venue is perfect for a small wedding or even a big one like ours of 150 people. They accommodate your every wish from allowing your own caterer and BYOB (With a license of course) Which she helps you get. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VENUE AND COORDINATOR. THANK YOU GAYLE!
