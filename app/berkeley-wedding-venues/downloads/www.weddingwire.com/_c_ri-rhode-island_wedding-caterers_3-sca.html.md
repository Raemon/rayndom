The food was amazing, we got positive reviews from everyone including my grandma who is always very hard to please! The cocktail hr, dinner and deserts were all perfect. It’s definitely worth the splurge. Their presentation is also beautiful. The only thing I will say is the dinner service was a little slow/behind schedule but there could have been a lack of communication on our end.

Elizabeth was outstanding, accommodating and helpful. We planned our wedding from Ohio with a specific menu in mind. The menu was changed several times and Elizabeth never got annoyed or upset with my requests. Everyone raved about the appetizers, the food, and the deserts, The presentation at the venue was charming and exactly as I had hoped. She even brought my husband and I an appetizer sampler since we were taking photos and missed cocktail hour. Elizabeth was so on point. I am so happy we went with 401. Elizabeth and her team made our day flawless!!!!

Alexis, TR and the rest of the McGrath's Catering team were an absolute pleasure to work with, start to finish. Our guests loved the quality and presentation of the food, and working with them throughout the planning process was a breeze. They accommodated all of our requests and took great care in ensuring that everything ran smoothly on our wedding day. Alexis even went so far as to make sure that all of our tables were set properly with our table numbers, etc., and she met individually with every vendor that day to make sure that all our timeline marks were met. These guys know what they're doing, you can't go wrong booking them for your special event!

Working with Mark and the Cozy Catering team was one of the easiest aspects of my wedding. We told them what we wanted and they took it from there. We had an early wedding and wanted to serve brunch. I wasn’t forced into a brunch with a “wedding tax” on it. Mark let me choose from their standard Brunch catering options. And you absolutely cannot beat their beverage package price. Beyond the food and guiding us through the day, the attention to detail is just incredible. Here is a photo of the Mark fluffing my dress for me as proof of their dedication to your day being perfect.

This was an amazing experience. It was cost affective and exciting for guests! As a person who isn't a fan of cake, this was a great alternative for my wedding! Would hire again!

Working with B&M was one of the easiest parts of our day! Gabriella was so helpful with building our pasta bar menu and they definitely delivered! Our guests raved about the food all night, and so did I! I fell in love with their chicken skewers and couldn’t get enough of them! My wife and I were served at our table, and the switch from cocktail to dinner service was so smooth I hardly even noticed! The care and attention to detail was phenomenal and we couldn’t have chosen better.
