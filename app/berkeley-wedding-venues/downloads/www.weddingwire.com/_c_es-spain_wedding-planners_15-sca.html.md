Agape Weddings by Miss Nokonoko orchestrated an absolutely marvelous wedding experience for my husband and me in Barcelona on June 22. Her impeccable sense of style, keen insight, and remarkablbility to handle a multitude of tasks effortlessly truly made our green wedding a dream come true. I'm genuinely taken aback and disheartened to see the unjust review below, as it fails to capture the exceptional talents of Miss Nokonoko and the incredible things she and her team are capable of. Planning a green wedding from afar was no easy feat, but from the moment we met Miss Nokonoko, we knew we had found the perfect person—our only choice—to bring our vision to life while staying within our budget. Her flexibility and expertise were paramount in creating the sustainable wedding we had always dreamed of. Miss Nokonoko is not only one of the warmest and most friendly individuals I have ever met, but she also possesses an extraordinary ability to handle any task, no matter how big or small. Her professionalism and dedication made our working relationship seamless and enjoyable. Even now, several years later, we are still in contact because I consider myself fortunate to call Miss Nokonoko a true friend. Infinitely grateful!!!”. 120

Our wedding simply wouldn’t have been the same without, Anna! You guided us from the very beginning and gave me the peace I needed during the most stressful moments, especially when I was close to losing my mind. Remember? 😀 You exude such calm that I immediately feel like I am in the best hands. No matter how much there was to do, you always offered new appointments to make sure we discussed every little detail. 🫶 What impressed me the most was your availability – it felt like you was always there, like a best friend. Whether I had a question early in the morning or late at night, you responded with advices. You was never annoyed and always patient, no matter how many times I asked. 🙈 Your organizational skills are truly admirable. You thought of everything, even the little details that made our wedding so special. I am certain that our celebration would not have been nearly as perfect without you. She did an amazing job. Your professionalism, dedication, and passion are simply exceptional. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for everything and patience with me/us. You and the whole Team made our day unforgettable - I will be forever thankful. ❤️ Cheers from Hamburg, Germany 🇩🇪 Sheron & Marc, 24.08.2024

Living in the US, I don't know what I would have done without the help from Jennifer planning my Barcelona wedding! She was so easy to communicate with, and did a fabulous job helping my vision for the wedding come to life, even when I had a difficult time describing what exactly it was that I wanted. Every detail was given the utmost attention. My wedding STUNNING! She connected me with the best vendors and was so helpful in guiding me towards what I needed (and didn't need) to suit the budget. On top of her outstanding professionalism, she's also a great person! She was on top of everything and there for me every step of the way, even when the inevitable wedding day jitters and minor complications arrived. Working with Jen was an absolute treasure, and I'm beyond grateful to call her a friend today. You will not regret choosing her.

Choosing Karolina as our wedding planner for our destination wedding in Barcelona was truly one of the best decisions we made. From our very first consultation, she exuded warmth, professionalism, and a deep understanding of what makes a wedding unforgettable. She listened closely to our vision and elevated it with thoughtful suggestions, impeccable taste, and creative touches that brought our ideas to life effortlessly. From start to finish, Karolina was organized, responsive, and proactive — truly the calm in all the wedding chaos. Vendor coordination, timeline management, décor styling, and guest logistics were all handled with such precision and grace that we never had to worry about a thing. She was always two steps ahead, anticipating needs before they even arose, and keeping everything running seamlessly on the big day. What makes Karolina exceptional is her blend of artistry and practicality. She never sugar-coated things, was realistic about our budget, and helped us strike the perfect balance between what we wanted and what made sense. Every vendor she recommended was a dream — from our florist’s breathtaking centerpieces to the flamenco dancer who became one of the most talked-about highlights of the entire night. As someone who’s definitely not a planner (very Type B over here!), having Karolina by my side kept me grounded and stress-free. Because of her, our wedding day was even more magical than we could have imagined — truly the best day of our lives. If you’re looking for someone who will treat your wedding with the care, artistry, and dedication it deserves, look no further than Karolina. She’s a true gem, and we’ll never forget the unforgettable experience she helped create. ❤️

From our very first conversation, Valerie was extremely attentive, helpful, insightful, and wonderfully personable. We quickly struck up a genuine and comfortable rapport with her, which was so crucial when navigating the complexities of planning a wedding abroad. We felt completely at ease approaching her with any question, query, or concern, no matter how small. Taking on an Irish-Armenian wedding is no small feat! Valerie's expertise was invaluable. She helped us facilitate countless details for the day that we, planning from afar, might not have thought of. Her amazing connections in the area and within the industry proved to be one of her greatest assets. She connected us with great vendors, all of whom were a genuine pleasure to work with. Her consistent attentiveness to detail, warm demeanor, and deep understanding of the destination wedding landscape make her an absolute asset to any couple looking to organize a wedding abroad. The ultimate testament came from our guests: one, who actually manages weddings at a popular hotel, said it was, quote, "the best organized wedding she’s ever attended." We couldn't agree more. Thank you, Valerie!

Dyana and her team are very professional and friendly team to work with. Nothing was to much trouble and organising my wedding from the uk was very easy as Dyana always replied in a timely manner. I would recommend Dyana to anyone organising an event as she understood what we wanted and made it a reality. Exceeded my expectations. Dyana has now become a friend and would always use them for any function. Well done Dyana and the team!!!!

I feel we were so lucky to work with her because everything was so easy and under control. Great professional, efficient and hard worker. We completely relay on her. The day was a success thanks to her. I would recommend her to everyone. Great experience!

Without doubt, Clandestine Events are the best wedding planners around. Lara and Charly are incredibly professional, but at the same time super personal, and made our wedding what it was! Why are they the best? Because they understand exactly what you want (and need). Plus, they get all the small details... little things that we would not have thought of, but which our guests loved. If we were to do it all over again, we would only pick Clandestine Events... no hesitations.
