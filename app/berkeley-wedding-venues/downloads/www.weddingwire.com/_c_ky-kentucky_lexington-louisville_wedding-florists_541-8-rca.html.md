A [wedding florist provides a variety of services](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-flower-arrangements-shopping-list), some of which might not be obvious at first.

  * Consultation: Your wedding florist will meet with you to discuss your vision for your wedding—your venue, your wedding style, your desired color palette, and the types of flowers you like and dislike. Your florist will then create a proposal which will describe the arrangements he or she will create as well as the prices.
  * Samples: After you’ve signed a contract and shortly before your wedding, your florist may also provide sample arrangements to ensure that you’re on the same page about how your wedding-day flowers will look.
  * Flowers: A big part of your wedding flower budget will go to the actual purchasing of the flowers. It actually takes several hours for a florist to put a flower order together—and the flowers your florist will receive from his or her wholesaler or grower are far better quality than the ones you can buy at your local grocery store. They’re grown especially to be featured at events and are hand-selected for their quality.
  * Flower processing and storage: Once your flowers arrive to your florist, he or she will take several hours (often a whole day!) to process your flowers (taking thorns off of roses, counting the flowers, etc.) and storing them in a refrigerated space to ensure they look amazing on your wedding day.
  * Labor and production: Now, it’s time for your florist to create those beautiful arrangements! Each arrangement takes time to design (probably more than you would think!), so it’s quite a long process.
  * Delivery and set up: Your florist and his/her team will then bring your arrangements to your venue. A good amount of work needs to be done on premises to make sure that your ceremony and reception looks picture-perfect, from the altar to the reception table arrangements.
  * Cleanup: After your wedding, your florist and his/her team will go to your venue to remove all of the arrangements and vessels, and assist with cleanup.



When should I hire a wedding florist?

__

We recommend hiring your wedding florist early on in the planning process, at least eight months before your wedding day. Start by reading online reviews of florists in your wedding location, and then narrow down the list to a few that you’d like to reach out to and meet with. 

What questions should I ask a wedding florist before hiring?

__

When first meeting with a wedding florist, it’s important to get a sense of his or her experience, creativity, and personality—as well as his or her wedding flowers cost. Here are some [questions to be sure to ask a wedding florist](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-questions-to-ask-your-wedding-florist):

  * How many weddings have you done?
  * Can you offer some suggestions for creating the look I want?
  * Can you work with my wedding flower budget?
  * Do you have other weddings booked on my wedding weekend?
  * Can I see a portfolio?
  * How do you store your flowers?
  * How do you transport the flowers?
  * Are there additional fees?
  * Will you provide samples before my wedding date?
  * Which other items (vessels, rentals, etc.) can you provide, and which will I have to source myself?

I can't say enough about Jeanie - she is amazing! She followed my daughter's vision perfectly and provided the most beautiful flowers I've ever seen. She did our welcome party & wedding with absolute perfection! I don't even think the pics we found on Pinterest hold up to the magic Jeanie did with her flowers. She is a true professional & I would recommend her HIGHLY! Our welcome party was held at the Andover Carson's and wedding was at Fasig-Tipton; Jeanie provided timeless arrangements that fit the elegance of our events perfectly. She also provided an extra bouquet on the day of the wedding we had mistakenly miscounted. She saved the day & it was absolutely perfect!! I can't say enough great things - you will not be disappointed.

Phoenix Hill absolutely blew us away with their wedding flowers! We asked for seasonal/fall colors, and they went above and beyond! The arrangements and bouquets were breathtaking, and I don’t think I’ll ever find another flower arrangement that compares. They were so easy to work with and even helped us out with our last-minute request. Not only that, but they were incredibly caring, sweet, and I could totally feel the love they put into our flowers. It was a real treat to chat with both of them before and after the event. I would highly recommend Phoenix Hill and would definitely order from them again if we ever find ourselves back in Louisville. Oh, and guess what? We were traveling and couldn’t take the flowers with us, so we decided to spread the love by passing them out to locals over the weekend. These flowers made their way throughout the city of Louisville and brought joy to everyone they met. We ordered two arrangements for the ceremony, an additional table arrangement, and two bouquets for our mothers.

Sarah was wonderful to work with and we would highly recommend hiring Rosealia for your wedding or any special event! My husband and I had to postpone our wedding twice due to the pandemic and our original florist was unavailable on our rescheduled date. We are so happy we found Rosealia and that they were able to accommodate all of our needs with only a few months notice. They put together a package to come as close as possible to our original budget and everything from set-up to breakdown service was completely seamless and affordable. Our flowers were absolutely beautiful! Thank you Roselia for being an awesome part of our wedding day!

Kelly at Schulz's Florist was excellent to work with from the very start. I told her my budget and showed her pictures of what I wanted and she was able to offer suggestions on how we could accomplish my dreams within my budget. I met with several florists and Kelly was the only one who even attempted to do this. She is extremely knowledgeable about all things floral and was so willing to work with us. Our flowers were beautiful the day of and she decorated our ceremony trellis and reception entry so beautifully. She exceeded my expectations in every aspect.

Rose + Thistle is fantastic! We selected Elizabeth to design and create the floral elements of our wedding because she demonstrated an unmatched level of creativity, artistry, and professionalism. She took the time to understand our aesthetic vision for our wedding, and she really got it - which was so important to us! And not only did she understand what we had in mind - she elevated it and refined it and the result was beyond stunning!!! It was perfect!!! Elizabeth exceeded our expectations during every step of the process. She was incredibly responsive and professional and refreshingly organized! We wholeheartedly recommend Rose + Thistle!

Marnie and Jenny went above and beyond for our wedding! They were a pleasure to work with, and their beautiful work - from the centerpieces to the ombré petal aisle that they created - was one of the highlights of our wedding. They made a stressful planning experience much less overwhelming. We would absolutely recommend them - thank you Marnie and Jenny!

I have to be honest, we looked at this vendor only because the location was convenient for us. However, when we met with the owner we were blown away by their floral arrangements, their beautiful little shop, and the personal touches! I provided a few pics of our color scheme and some basic ideas, and Lavender Hill made everything exactly as we dreamed! I recommend any arrangement with dried lavender, because even though the petals are dried and flake a bit, the relaxing aroma is just what every bride needs on her special day.
