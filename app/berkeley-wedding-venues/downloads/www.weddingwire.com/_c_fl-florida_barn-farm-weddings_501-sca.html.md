This venue is truly top notch. From the moment we stepped onto the property, we fell in love. The grounds are naturally beautiful with elegant touches that made it the perfect place for our wedding. From the time we booked, Shawna was wonderful to work with and helped make our big day everything we hoped for. She even hatched baby chickens for us to interact with on our wedding day, which was such a special touch. We booked the cottage for our rehearsal dinner and it was the perfect size and exactly what we needed. We were able to get into the house early to get ready, and we stayed in the bridal suite after the wedding. The house was adorable and beautifully furnished, both for our stay and for the girls to get ready. Even though Shawna was out of town on our wedding day, she and her staff made everything run smoothly. She was always quick to answer any questions before, during, and after the wedding. The property and the team truly provide a five star experience. I would absolutely recommend Bridle Oaks Barn for a wedding or any other event.

I can’t say enough about this venue! Our wedding was on 10.25.25, “Til Death” Halloween Inspired. The staff brought my vision to LIFE! Cheryl, Becky, and the rest of the staff was with me every step of the planning process, everyone was so nice, and very professional. Communication was amazing (I literally sent an email probably every other day 😆). I love to plan, decorate events, & I am a perfectionist. To put all trust and faith in the hand of the staff says ALOT! Lol. Nothing is perfect in this world, but I can honestly say 100% our wedding was absolutely PERFECT! All our guests are still telling us that our wedding was the BEST wedding they’ve ever been too. I can’t thank you enough and we are truly grateful. A TIME WAS HAD! We highly recommend Florida Rustic Barn Wedding for your venue for any event

From the bottom of our hearts, my husband and I want to say thank you to Ann, Meagan, and the entire October Oaks Team for making our day so far beyond incredible. From the day you reach out to inquire about having your wedding at this venue, DO IT, Ann will be there to give you all the information you need. A few things that really sold us on October Oaks are: \- The venue is insanely beautiful and speaks for itself. It's so versatile. \- We also really appreciated that they have an entire building dedicated to wedding decor that their couples are allowed to use. \- Having a venue owner that doubles as a day of coordinator is invaluable. She knows her stuff because it's literally her stuff. lol \- Knowing that we would have a 4-week meeting prior to wedding day to make sure all our ducks were in a row. It really gave us confidence that our day would come, and we wouldn't have to scramble for anything. When it came time for the reception, they made sure to celebrate with us and keep everything running smoothly. Booking October Oaks is like becoming a part of their family. You really know that they care about each and every couple that comes their way. Forever grateful!! -Mr and Mrs Teckemeyer

When my now husband and I were searching for the perfect venue a friend of ours recommended we check out Music Ranch. The atmosphere and the people running this beautiful venue went above and beyond to make our special day perfect! Brandy and her father Phil make you feel welcome and they help with anything and everything they can. I want to thank all the behind the scenes people that help them with the aftermath of the events! I would recommend them to anyone! 10/22/22 best day ever!

We are so happy to have had Up the Creek Farms as our wedding venue! Everything from the florals to the catering far exceeded our expectations. The planning team thinks through every detail and makes the entire process stress free. The grounds are absolutely beautiful with a lovely space to get ready and the outdoor ceremony space combined with the boathouse for the reception is perfection. We would highly recommend Up the Creek Farms to anyone! Photos: Photography by V

Our wedding was the best wedding I had ever been to- we had such an amazing day. This venue has a newly renovated ceremony and reception site, giving it an elegant touch. Huge shoutout to our day of coordinator Hector- this man absolutely loves what he does. He truly just wants the bride and groom to have the best day and will never make you feel awkward for any special requests. We booked our venue without seeing bridal suite due to it being occupied by anther bride- and when I shared this with Hector at a bridal show hosted at the venue, he was quick to buggy us there to show us. I will never forget that. My only gripes with the reception space is the supporting pillars on the dance floor. It made it difficult for guests to watch first dances and not bump into them during the dancing portion. I would also consider providing cool sunglasses to guests for the outside ceremony, as we didn’t realize our guests would be blinded by the sun. These are not necessarily “docks” on the venue; however, it is good to know for prospecting couples. We also felt we were being nickled and dimed for basic upgrades like wedding arches and chargers. I did appreciate that they provided a military promo to help cover it. I highly recommend getting the diamond package as it ends up paying for itself. They will not let you upgrade to that package if a lower tiered is already contracted.

This venue is GORGEOUS. Lisa, the owner, was so great to work with. She let me visit the farm a few times leading up to the wedding so I could keep the space fresh in mind and plan everything out. She was easy to get in contact with and she was very flexible as far as what vendors I was able to hire. She also had great suggestions and ideas whenever I asked her opinion. Our wedding was beautiful and I can't thank her enough!
