Milo and Ivy team showed up and took the pressure and stress off our shoulders. They were so pleasant, accommodating, straight forward, and helpful. I honestly couldn't asked for a more supportive staff. Our celebration was beautiful and to add a sweet touch they gave us a wedding gift was simple but very thoughtful. I'm grateful to have found them at the last minute.

This is a location like nothing else in our city. It is not only a beautiful setting amidst the gardens, but includes an incredible farmhouse for the event, allowing backup plans if the weather isn't perfect! The staff is responsive and kind. Ready to answer any questions and make your even go on without a hitch (unless your getting married then there is for sure to be at least one hitch ;-))

We had our wedding in the chapel itself, and it was very beautiful! The property manager was very flexible and was more than willing to accommodate us on our wedding day. 10/10

Cator woolford gardens is a gem nestled in metro Atlanta, and it perfectly fit my vision for a spring garden wedding. We were a little indecisive initially about booking CWG because we wanted to do an outdoor dinner and were worried about rain, but we worked with the venue and our coordinator to make sure we had a perfect rain plan. If you book here, I highly recommend renting a tent in case of rain and eating dinner outside instead of in the atrium upstairs—it was so beautiful for us. They don’t allow amplified music outside, so we booked a string quartet for the outdoor ceremony, cocktail hour, and dinner, and moved to the upstairs indoor atrium for dancing with a DJ after dinner. Madison was an amazing venue coordinator and helped make sure the day went smoothly. My main advice is to reference the list of recommended vendors if you book here, because there are some logistical things that can make this venue more challenging for vendors to navigate (like switching between the gardens and the atrium). Also, book The Peachy Keen Lady as your coordinator! She knows this venue like the back of her hand and will be sure all your other vendors do too. Amazing venue for an amazing day!

Everyone complimented us on how beautiful the grounds were. The coordinators were so helpful and did everything I needed on the day of. Food was amazing! Our guests loved the brisket and the appetizers during cocktail hour were so good.

I used the Tara Place Condo for my ceremony which turned out nice. I then had the reception in the Tara Ballroom and the Levy Restaurant provided all the food and servers. The prices and menu selection is expansive. They can pretty much do anything you desire. I really enjoyed working with the AMS on my wedding day.

The Northbank Recreation Area is the most beautiful area in the park to hold a ceremony. It only cost between $30-50 to reserve the covered picnic shelters and you have a beautiful backdrop for your outdoor wedding.

I couldn’t have picked a better location. It’s quaint, yet grand and elegant. The level of service they provide is exceptional! The freedom included to make your own choices is impeccable as well. If I could do it again I’d do it here again!

Chef Nick and his team were INCREDIBLE!! Loved his flexibility and creativity to make the entire menu personal and a reflection of my husband and I. All of our favorites: braised short rib, cheese grits, risotto, and fried cheese curd for one of the appetizers ( my husbands from Wisconsin::), etc. He even made my Yias Yias Greek Salad recipe! Can’t begin to tell you how many compliments we had on how amazing the food was! All of our guest said it was literally the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding! HIGHEST recommendation!!
