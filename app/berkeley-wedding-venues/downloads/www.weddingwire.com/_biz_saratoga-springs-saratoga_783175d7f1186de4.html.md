Excellent wedding venue! 

Most excellent wedding venue! My daughter and her husband had the most beautiful wedding on 9/2025 in Cathedral Oaks for 130 people. The venue was so perfect, the staff was extremely attentive, and food was fantastic . All our guests commented on what a fabulous wedding. Most important of all, the bride and groom were so happy!   
  
I most highly recommend this for a wedding venue. It is such a lovely place, surrounded by spring fed creeks, shade trees, and natural beauty! Thank you Saratoga Springs staff!

Our Wedding Day Superheroes!

I cannot say enough about the incredible team at Saratoga Springs who made our wedding day flawless. From the planning stages through the very last song, every single one of them went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and more.  
  
✨ Dayana (Day-of Coordinator): She worked tirelessly all day, so much so that I—the bride—asked her to take a break. She just laughed and said no, because she was determined to make sure every detail was perfect.  
  
✨ Calista, Leslie & Jaycey: Warm, attentive, and always there before I even realized I needed something. Their behind-the-scenes effort truly made the day run so smoothly.  
  
✨ Dominic: He made sure things flowed seamlessly and was such a calm, steady presence throughout the day.  
  
✨ Olivia (Wedding Planner): I had the privilege of working with Olivia for over a year, and she was my rock. She gave me advice, guided me, kept me on track, and eliminated stress before it even had the chance to build. Practical, reassuring, and so knowledgeable—she made wedding planning feel easy.  
  
✨ DJ Linh: If you’re planning a wedding, book him now. He had multiple meetings with us, reassured us every step of the way, and then absolutely killed it on the big day. The music, the vibe, and the energy were everything we hoped for and more..  
  
This group truly became our dream team. They worked together seamlessly to make sure we could just enjoy every moment, and we are forever grateful for them.

Our whimsical garden wedding

We had our wedding at Saratoga Springs, and it was truly the most magical experience! From start to finish, the entire team was wonderful to work with. Jennifer helped us with booking and was so patient and kind. She answered every single one of our (many!) questions and made the process so smooth. Olivia and Sam were fantastic in helping us plan all the details. We had two meetings, which could be virtual or in person, and a lot of email communication to make sure everything was to our liking and that we had every option selected.  
  
Our day-of wedding coordinator, Carissa, was an absolute gem who we first met on the rehearsal day. She was amazing. I can’t say enough about the staff’s attitude and kindness. I already had blisters on my feet before the ceremony, and they quickly brought me some band-aids right before I walked down the aisle!  
  
Our ceremony was at Long Bridge, and it honestly felt like a fairytale wedding surrounded by the most beautiful nature. Their dinner options were a little basic for us, but one of the things we really appreciated is that Saratoga Springs allows outside catering without charging extra fees, which is rare for venues in the area.  
  
Their beer and wine selection is excellent, and the cocktails were a huge hit with our guests! We went with Mai Tais and Margaritas.  
We also rented the Creekside Room for our after-party, and it was absolutely perfect. It was spacious, cozy, and had such a fun vibe. The outdoor fireplace and plenty of seating made it so comfortable for our non-dancing guests to relax. They also provide late-night snacks when you book the Creekside Room, which was a nice touch.  
  
Honestly, we wouldn’t have wanted our wedding anywhere else. Everything was perfect from start to finish, and we’re so grateful to the entire Saratoga Springs team for making our day so special!

Best night ever

We had our wedding at Saratoga Springs, and it was truly the best night ever. The venue is breathtaking—nestled in a gorgeous natural setting with a perfect mix of rustic charm and romantic elegance. From the moment we booked, we felt completely supported and well taken care of.  
  
The team at Saratoga Springs was incredibly thorough, organized, and detail-oriented. Communication was excellent every step of the way, and they really took the time to understand us as a couple and help bring our vision to life. Their professionalism gave us total peace of mind, and everything on the day-of ran so smoothly thanks to them.  
  
Not only was the setting beautiful, but the food and drinks were fantastic. Our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was, and the bar service was top-notch. The whole experience—from the ceremony to the last song on the dance floor—was seamless, joyful, and better than we could have imagined.  
  
We highly recommend Saratoga Springs to any couple looking for a magical venue with an incredible team. It was everything we hoped for and more.

Excellent venue

Saratoga Springs was an excellent wedding venue for us -- the people there were extremely helpful, the venue had good value for its price, and it was beautiful.   
  
The folks at Saratoga Springs helped us out quite a bit without being overbearing. We had checklists and timelines ready in advance, the walkthrough two days before that they ran was instructive, and we were able to get quick turn around with our many questions about possible changes to what we wanted. The venue is not cheap, but it has very good value for what it offers, especially if your guests drink more alcohol than ours did. The prices are fair and allowed us to have exactly what we wanted from our wedding. And finally, the location is gorgeous - the trees and the creeks and even the banana slugs in our wedding pictures are going to make us happy for years to come. Only caveat is to make sure to tell out of town guests about the weather -- tent rental isn't an option, but most of our guests dressed for the unseasonably cold day just fine, and we preferred the all-outdoor venue for covid safety reasons. Overall, we would strongly recommend Saratoga Springs as a venue.

Beautiful wedding venue in the woods

Saratoga Springs made our dream wedding come true! We chose SS because we both love nature. The trees, the creek, the lighting, and the atmosphere at SS were exactly what we were looking for. Sam and Olivia from SS were super awesome coordinators. They helped us a ton in planning and coordinating during rehearsal and on the day of our wedding. They made everything very smooth, which put us at ease and helped us enjoy our very special day. Many of our guests told us that it was the best wedding they have ever attended. We highly recommend hosting your wedding and events at Saratoga Springs!

Beautiful venue with wonderful staff

My wife and I got married at Saratoga Springs and I cannot recommend this venue enough. Working with the company, setup, take down, and everything in between was easy and simple. They communicated clearly and responded to all questions and requests promptly. We even had a major emergency on our wedding day and they went out of their way to work with us on adjusting the timeline and suggesting ways to resolve our problem.  
  
The location itself is absolutely gorgeous, we got married at Cathedral Grove and having everything next to the creek in the forest was magical. All our guests were raving about the location saying it was one, if not the, most beautiful wedding they've ever been to.   
  
We did catering thru them and the food was excellent, buffet style made it easy for guests to get what they want and get any seconds they so desired. That combined with the self served beer and wine made it easy for our guests to get as much food and drinks they desired.  
  
All staff we meet and worked with were all professional and friendly. The wedding planner you get day off was great, she was incredibly friendly and assisted us so much due to unforeseen emergencies that happened the morning of our special day. She helped make the already stressful day even easier.  
  
Just a note regarding this location, due to local regulations they are limited on music and drink options (limited live music and no hard liquor). But the venue company has a great list of options that are allowed. Also the companies they do work with are all wonderful, experienced, and were easy to work with.  
  
I would 100% recommend this place for your wedding, personal event, or corporate party. Besides its stunning location and looks the process to host an amazing event is easy and stress free with them.

Made this DIY bride's dreams come true!

My fiance (now husband!) and I love California and really wanted an outdoor wedding. I wanted it to be amongst the trees that we love so much. I was also set on being as cost-effective as possible and so did not end up using a wedding planner, so one of the things that drew me to the venue most was that they knew exactly what they were doing and I only had to make decisions around the package options they already thoughtfully put-together (e.g., I had to select from their list of DJs, they had catering options from which I could choose), and they also had options for more flexibility, if I decided I wanted to go that way (e.g., if I didn't want to use their catering service, if I had other decoration ideas in mind, etc.). The other specific things that made a difference for me were that they were dog-friendly, offered s'mores (something my husband and I love!), and their team was SO responsive and had detailed examples of pretty much anything I could think of. Jennifer (Director of Celebrations) was an awesome and responsive tour guide that made me so excited because she seemed so excited, and I couldn't be more grateful to Olivia and Samantha who were so patient with me as I took so long to make decisions / give directions. My day-of-coordinator, Cammie, was the absolute sweetest and made me feel so comfortable and calm on what was a very (wonderfully) chaotic day). I pulled everything together in the last week and the setup and cleanup staff executed everything perfectly. The venue was gorgeous and food was delicious, and I had many guests share the same compliment with me. Maybe the only thing is that I wish there was an option to have live music on past the 10pm Saratoga county curfew but that couldn't be helped. Plus, they are clearly professionals and creative because there are options to do a silent disco with headphones should you choose to stay past 10pm. It was the cozy, enchanted, forest fairy tale wedding I had hoped for!

The Perfect Magical Night!

I had bookmarked Saratoga Springs as a potential venue even before I was engaged because of all the beautiful photos I've seen on IG. We did a semi-private tour back in Summer 2023 and almost immediately fell in love. We had scheduled other venues to tour that we ended up canceling because this was the one!  
  
Jennifer Clark, the director, was super easy to talk to and answered all of our questions. Throughout our time preparing for this event, Olivia and Samantha were extraordinary in their communication, response time, and knowledge of these types of events. They did a wonderful job in helping us understand what we needed vs. what we wanted and good decisions to make. They never tried to upsell us on more expensive options, in fact, always letting us know the best value for what we wanted. Throughout this process, we knew we had made the right choice in terms of staff. Diana, our day of venue coordinator, was so helpful with all the vendors and my day of coordinator. Compared to other venues we were looking at, Saratoga Springs also wasn't outrageously expensive and what really sold us was being able to do outside catering.  
  
Scenically, Saratoga Springs is stunning! An outdoor venue with several different species of large trees like oaks and redwoods, many small creeks that run through and around the venue, and several amenities included such as lights that wrap around the trees, a firepit, and artificial turf that you can actually wear high heels on! We were in love with the scenery immediately because our reception was LOTR/Legend of Zelda themed and this was perfect for us. For reference, we booked the Cathedral Grove for early October. No worries about rain, but we didn't anticipate the heatwave! Luckily, Cathedral Grove is shaded and it ended up being the perfect summer weather for the evening. There was another wedding in Longbridge, but it wasn't an issue for us. Every one of our guests raved about how gorgeous the venue is!  
  
My only gripe is not being able to do outside vendors for the DJ, but I think it is just because we chose poorly from their list of DJs.

Magical Day!

Saratoga Springs is a stunning venue with so much to offer. Back in 2022, I spent 6 months looking for a venue that was not only beautiful but also affordable and Saratoga Springs hit all of our boxes. From the stunning forest setting to the beautiful fairy lights to the option to have your ceremony at 3 different venues depending on the size of your wedding, it was absolutely magical.   
  
We got married in Cathedral Grove which was everything I dreamed of for a forest wedding. The trees above the venue bend to look like a cathedral and the sun peaking through the trees was dreamy. We got married on a freak heat wave and it was so nice in the shade of the trees.   
  
They take care of everything related to food, drink, and set up along with offering incredible vendors which was such a blessing to have so many options. Yes, you do have to pay more for certain things such as set up and take down of whatever you bring to the venue but it was extremely helpful day of to not make our families have to worry about it and it wasn't expensive at all. The food was also incredible!!   
  
We really appreciate Saratoga Springs and their teams for all they offer!

One of our very favorite venues in the Bay Area... Saratoga Springs makes wedding planning effortless... and they have an amazing staff.. we love working with them ALL!

Saratoga Springs is a magical place in a beautiful wooded setting for weddings, corporate events and private parties just up the hill (yet a world away) from Saratoga proper. They accommodate small intimate gatherings up to large groups. The staff is congenial and works to tailor each event to the wishes of the client. The food bears a mention, too: they do a spectacular, delicious BBQ spread.

I had the opportunity to photograph a wedding at the Saratoga Springs Campground and they do an absolutely beautiful job! All of their staff is amazing to work with and you couldn't ask for a better location! Jennifer was a dream to work with. As a wedding professional, I really appreciate it when the vendors you get to work with are as amazing as Jennifer and the Saratoga Springs! I can't wait to go back.
