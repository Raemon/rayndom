I know it's a bit unconventional to have your wedding at an Elks' Lodge, but it turned out beautifully. We had our ceremony outdoors on the grass, which overlooks the golf course and the hills. We had the reception indoors. When I got there the morning of the wedding, the staff had already set up all the tables. They cook all the food there. They gave us choices of different menus, and the options were flexible. Everyone loved the food! They offer buffet or plated meals. They have a bar there, and they offer you the option of having it open or not. They will also provide champagne and sparkling cider for toasting for a nominal additional fee. Tables, chairs, linens, dinnerware, silverware and glasses are included. They also only book one wedding per day, so you're not rushed out. We had the building all day.

It was a horrible experience and I do not recommend anyone having there wedding here! It was non stop problems. I planned my wedding here one year in advance and had everything already taken care of and fully planned out with the food and coordinator and lodge. Then two months before we get notice that the catering services have changed and the prices will be different then what we agreed on in the beginning as well as the food. It was a battle for about a month trying to fix it, luckily the only good part about the lodge is Diane the new caterer. She worked with me to help me out because of it being unfair to change things on me last minute knowing that I had a strict budget. So I do suggest using there catering company they hire, but the venue itself staff is horrible. So that got worked out then, we had the original coordinator quit and we had no one to help run the day of the wedding. So they gave us a replacement person who was supposed to meet with me and go over things, and never did so I didn't meet her till the three hours before the wedding. She was rude with me from the start and was no help. She was rude with my mom as well, and made things a lot worse. We were behind schedule because of an incident with the cake falling over during delivery and so we started 30 mins late. So after the ceremony I was finally not stressed and happy, then she tells me we have to just skip our first dance because we are behind schedule and need to feed everyone. I lost it! Who tells the bride that she has to just skip a huge part of getting married because she wants to follow a schedule and get out on time. A horrible person that's who. my sister had to take her outside and have a talk with her. After that our DJ's saved the day and took over as well as Diane. Then it went smoothly after that. So I let go of all my stressed cause from this place to then two months after get a bill for the rest of the cost of champagne from the wedding I ordered. I was given a price befo
