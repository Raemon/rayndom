Our experience with Castello del Trebbio for our destination wedding was nothing short of exceptional. Alberto the manager was an absolute pleasure to work with, and he made the daunting task of planning an international wedding for 40 guests with all the bells and whistles achievable and as pain-free as possible. He helped us every step of the way, down to the tiniest of details. His work ethic is impeccable, because he truly loves what he does. We have the upmost respect for him. All of the preferred vendors are also wonderful, professional people that helped make our day special. The castle, apartments, and vineyard grounds are gorgeous from every angle. This place feels like a dream. The restaurant, food and wine were perfection, and they were amazing with accommodating a number of different allergies for my guests. The restaurant manager Giuliana was so warm and welcoming, and took care of our guests so well! Despite the year of planning and the months after our wedding day, we are still in disbelief of how perfect everything was. It was truly magical. The memories made there by us, our friends and family will likely be talked about for the rest our our lives. We look forward to the day we can revisit, walk the grounds, and have an anniversary dinner at the restaurant.

From the very beginning, we felt that San Pietro sopra le Acque had a clear and well-structured approach — and for us, that made all the difference. We are detail-oriented people and appreciated being guided through a thoughtful planning process, with clear timelines and a technical planning document that helped us see the whole picture months in advance. Knowing that everything was carefully mapped out made us feel calm and confident throughout the journey. On the wedding day itself, everything unfolded naturally and smoothly. One moment we will always remember is just before the ceremony, when Sara was there with me, offering quiet guidance and reassurance as I prepared to walk in. That presence was incredibly comforting for me in that specific moment. A stunning venue, a highly professional team, and an organization that allows you to truly be present and enjoy every moment.

Getting married at Palazzo al Piano was one of the happiest decisions we made in organizing our wedding. From our very first visit, we were struck by the beauty and harmony of the place: an elegant setting, surrounded by nature, where every space is designed to welcome guests gracefully and make every moment feel special. The garden, the indoor areas, and the courtyard are maintained with rare precision: there’s soul, taste, and a genuine sense of hospitality that can be felt everywhere. One of the things that impressed us most was the helpfulness and kindness of the entire staff—always discreetly present, ready to assist, offer advice, or step in when needed. Palazzo al Piano is not just beautiful—it’s a place that truly works, creating the ideal conditions for you to fully enjoy your special day. We couldn’t be happier with our choice. We would choose it again a hundred times over.

We had our wedding at Masseria Spina in early June 2025 and couldn’t have been happier with the venue. It’s a unique and beautiful location, one of the oldest historic Masserias in Puglia, with a great layout that allowed us to move seamlessly from the Arabic garden ceremony, to drinks in the adjacent garden, and dinner in the courtyard. The food was excellent and widely praised by our guests, and the florals were very well done and suited the setting perfectly. Marco and his team were professional, very responsive throughout the planning process, and ensured the day itself ran smoothly and was well organised. We would highly recommend Masseria Spina to anyone planning a wedding in Puglia.

Castello di Petrata is such a gem! It not only a stunning atmosphere for a wedding, but the service, food, and team are excellent to collaborate with! Giovanni and Luca are incredible at what they do, and you will not be disappointed by selecting this location for your wedding day.

We had our wedding at Castello Brancaccio, and it was truly the most magical experience we could have ever imagined. The celebration lasted for three unforgettable days, with our guests staying two nights at the castle, and everything—from the rooms to the food to the atmosphere—was simply perfect. From the moment we arrived, the staff welcomed us with genuine warmth and professionalism. Everyone was incredibly friendly, attentive, and ready to help with anything we needed. Throughout the entire three days, they made sure every detail was taken care of, and any small issues were resolved immediately with a smile. The wedding day itself was flawless. The ceremony in the castle’s stunning setting felt straight out of a fairytale, and the reception ran seamlessly thanks to the amazing team. The food was exceptional—authentic Italian dishes beautifully presented, with delicious local ingredients and a perfect balance of tradition and creativity. The drinks were just as fantastic, from Aperol Spritz to the local wines and cocktails served at the bar. Our guests were delighted with the comfortable and elegant rooms, and the rustic breakfast buffet the next morning was a real treat—freshly baked bread, cheeses, fruit, and great coffee served in the medieval kitchen. A special mention goes to our DJ, who kept the dance floor alive all night—everyone was up dancing, laughing, and enjoying themselves until the very last song. It was exactly the lively, joyful atmosphere we had hoped for. Every part of the castle, from the terrace to the dining halls and gardens, was beautifully prepared and perfectly lit, creating the most romantic ambiance imaginable. We can confidently say this was a wedding we and our guests will remember for the rest of our lives. Castello Brancaccio is not just a venue—it’s an experience filled with heart, history, and outstanding hospitality. To the entire team: thank you for making our dream wedding come true. ❤️

This venue is absolutely gorgeous. My husband and I live in Florida and wanted an international wedding and never saw the venue in person until our wedding. Marco, the venue owner, provided us with numerous recommendations for vendors. Additionally, he was always very prompt with responding when we had questions. All of our guests were able to stay on property for 2 nights. The food at the venue for our welcome dinner and wedding dinner was some of the best food we have had in our lives. We had multiple choices for food. Our wedding was perfect and Marco and Lavinia our wedding planner made sure everything went according to plan. We have nothing but amazing things to say about Marco and Tenuta di Forte Sorgnano. Our guests also had an amazing time and are still raving about their experience and the food. We truly will be dreaming of this place and our wedding day for the rest of our lives. Thank you Marco for outstanding service!

In Friuli’s embrace, where the mountains rise, Through vineyards lush and under azure skies, A castle stands, regal, proud, and free, Castello di Spessa, our sanctuary. With turrets that kiss the heavens above, Amidst whispers of history, we found our love. Your hand in mine, as the winds softly sighed, In this realm of enchantment, we became unified. The sun painted shadows on stone’s gentle grace, As laughter and vows danced in this sacred space. The beauty around us, a canvas divine, Became the backdrop of love, eternally thine. Each sip of the wine, rich as the day, Echoes the promise that our hearts now relay. From the plains to the hills, with each winding road, In this splendid region, our dreams overflowed. In Friuli-Venezia, time ceased its flight, As we pledged our forever, a bond forged in light. May the echoes of joy linger soft in the air, For in this grand castle, we found our affair. So here, in this haven, where dreams intertwine, Our love story began, in a land so divine. Forever entwined, through valleys and skies, In Friuli’s embrace, where true love never dies. Allora, the server Romano @ La Tavernetta al Castello Di Spessa is by far the best server this side of Mediterranean Sea & under the Venetian sun. May he continue to shine through 100 more summers :) Ostunio + Butler

We celebrated our wedding in Castello della Castelluccia in October 2023 with over 120 of our friends and family. The food, service, venue and atmosphere were second to none. Myriam gave us lots of tips for how best to make the most of the venue for our wedding, and her team were always on hand to ensure everything went smoothly. We had the most incredible celebration and would highly recommend Castello della Castelluccia to any other couples. Photos copyright @maisonpestea
