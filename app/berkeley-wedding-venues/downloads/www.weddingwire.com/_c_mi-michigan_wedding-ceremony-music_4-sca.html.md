Go 4 Baroque did an amazing job at our wedding reception and really put a classic and sophisticated touch on the night! We listened to recordings of many quartets in the area and decided that Go 4 Baroque was the best, plus they had a huge song selection on their website to pick and choose from. They were very professional, prompt in email responses, and showed up on time ready to play. Would highly recommend this group to anyone looking for a string quartet.

We hired james because of his elegant playing style , which we thought sounded like andre segovia. James Showed the up early That day at the blue dress barn near benton harbor. A few of the guests had arrived , and though they were very few people , james began playing beautifully. By the time all the guests set arrived and the seating arrangement, He had already been playing a half hour and very beautiful , elegant back preludes , etc. Every guest was impressed by his professionalism and demeanor. We would recommend James for any event that requires an edge of classical elegance and style.

After quite a bit of research, we selected Rondo to play the music for our ceremony, cocktail hour, and dinner. We were looking for a local group who we knew would arrive as the group we hired. It seemed so many groups are actually agencies or say they are a group but have many musicians on hand and send whoever is available to your event. The Rondo String Quartet are true professionals and we felt comfortable talking directly to the people who would be at our wedding. They helped us all the way through the process of booking them and selecting music. On our wedding day, they played just absolutely beautifully! Rondo created the perfect experience for us and our guests and I can't thank them enough!

Skye was so easy to work with, from beginning to end, the whole experience was wonderful and filled with so much compassion. The ceremony was peaceful and dreamlike with her beautiful harp playing. She transported us to another dimension and took away so much of the stress that happens during weddings away. Her playing elevated the whole ceremony, it truly transported us to a dream. That’s how heavenly she plays and it was a catholic wedding too; our priest loved her playing as did the guests. She took her time to talk to us, to provide us with ideas, to record music to show us how it would sound, and to coordinate with everyone around to ensure the whole ceremony proceeded without any issues. I can’t recommend her enough, for weddings, events, and galas. You truly can’t go wrong with working with her, she’s delightful, respectful, and so very kind. I truly can’t rave about her enough, she’s phenomenal!

Colleen was a dream to work with! The music for our ceremony and cocktail hour was so dreamy and truly made the whole day so much more special! I also surprised my groom with his favorite song as our ceremony exit, and Colleen was so great about being willing to find the music! Truly, amazing!

We had the pleasure of having Shawn from Detroit Violin perform at our Wedding! Shawn worked with us ahead of time to create a list of music that fit the feeling of the day as well as the style we liked. Shawn is professional and incredibly easy to work with throughout the planning process. During the Ceremony, his music was the perfect touch of elegance we needed! Then transitioning to cocktail hour seamlessly keeping the energy light and joyful while setting the perfect tone. All of my guests said that Shawn added elegance to our special day and thought he was amazing! Thank you Shawn for making our wedding unforgettable!

Star String Quartet did an absolutely beautiful job at our wedding cocktail hour! Throughout the planning process Hektor was communicative, professional, and friendly. Star String played a perfect mix of classic jazz (Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, etc.) and modern (Taylor Swift, the Ed Sheeran, etc.) You will not regret booking these talented musicians!
