Rev. Joe S

Rev. Joe was great. Wrote everything for us (which was exactly what we wanted!) after getting to know us. Even met with us for coffee so we could get to know him before we decided on an officiant.

Amazing Officiant

Rev. Joe was beyond awesome! We are a same sex couple and Rev. Joe was just so great to work with. He made us feel extremely comfortable. He was quick to respond to all of our questions. He was professional, and kind throughout the entire process. We would absolutely recommend him come to anyone looking for a responsible, kind, professional officiant.

Very Pleased!

We were pleased to have Rev Joseph Paul officiate our wedding. We appreciate him taking the time to get to know us and to get a feel for how we wanted our ceremony to be like. He has been super accommodating throughout the whole process - from helping us structure the ceremony to helping with the marriage license. Glad to have his guidance through all this. Very pleasant to work with. I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for a more than exceptional service and experience!

Made the big day easy and excellent 

Rev Joe was a very nice and professional . He would always respond back to my calls and emails with all my crazy questions. His services were wonderful and he did such a nice job with our ceremony. There were changes to the ceremony and he was right on top of fixing anything we didnt want or suggested. I enjoyed working with him and he was wonderful to work with on our wedding day.

Reverend Joe is the best!!!!!!

Planning a wedding is never easy, and working with multiple vendors is part of all the work you have to do to get it done. What we loved about Rev Joe was that he was super personable, and was flexible enough to meet up with us (on our schedule) to go over all the details. He made the process so seamless. He was very attentive to our needs and open minded for what we wanted (we are not the most traditional couple) and he was committed to giving us the ceremony we wanted, which was a stark change from other priests, etc, had told us previously (and hence why we didn’t end up working with them). Rev Joe also handled all the paper work for us the day-of so we didn’t have to worry about it. 10/10, we fully recommend Rev Joe!

When I searched for an officiant for our wedding, I wasn't sure which direction to go in because we were not having a religious ceremony and did not have another option. So I searched online (which I felt was weird) but then I came across Rev. Joe. We spoke on the phone, and just from our phone call, I knew he would be a good fit. We met in person and went over everything, worked out a ceremony via e-mail, met one more time before the wedding when he had us fill out our marriage license, and the day went perfectly smooth! I booked him very early in advance and he was extremely responsive via e-mail. I had to call him when I applied for my marriage license and he answered right away and was happy to help me! You cannot beat his prices. He was the perfect officiant and I recommend him to ANYONE! Even the pickiest of brides! Thank you again Rev. Joe!
