Ben and Emily Williams did an EXCELLENT job! It is hard to express how pleased I am with their performance. From the beginning, they showed excellent customer service. They listened to what I wanted and gave their professional opinion of what could work and what could not work. I wanted an additional musician; they recommended what musician would sound best. They emailed songs for me to listen to so that I had a choice in music selection. They were on time for the rehearsal and the wedding day. My family and friends are still talking about how well the music sounded. I am so happy with my decision to use musicians for my wedding. I appreciated their musical ability as well as their professional and nice attitude.

Her talent is Heavenly and no one can compare.Her music contributed to our wedding was 2nd to my wife on how beautifully composed it was and what comes out of the instrument is Angelic sounding.

Mandy played for our wedding 2 weeks ago. Wish we could have heard everything. Great comments. One of our guests told us she could have listened to her all day. On time even with thunderstorms turning to snow blizzard. Would recommend her to anyone lucky enough to get her.

Levi was so easy to work with, extremely responsive, and very professional. I asked for a specific rendition of my aisle song, and as soon as he started playing, I knew he nailed it. For me, hearing Levi playing while I was getting ready was a highlight. It created a sense of calm and made me smile. I just loved it. My husband and our guests loved it too. They raved about how Levi seamlessly transitioned from song to song, and they enjoyed guessing the instrumental versions of the classic love songs Levi played. It would have been easy for someone to play classic fairytale tunes in a cheesy way, but Levi was able to highlight their beauty and timelessness. Levi was the perfect detail to tie our ceremony together and make it feel extra special and sweet. Can't recommend him enough

I met Nicole Britt at a wedding expo in Biloxi in 2019. I knew I had to have her at our wedding. In fact, it was what I wanted to “treat myself” with.... a beautiful painting to capture a moment in time from the happiest day of my life. Of course, all of that 2019 bride to be excitement was soon squashed by the Covid-19 pandemic. At the time, my husband and I were devastated. Discouraged. Ready to throw in the towel. We postponed our wedding twice. Each time, this precious lady stood by our side and always provided warmth, comfort and love to both of us. I will never forget her kindness, professionalism and grace during such a turbulent time in our lives. Fast forward to 2021, we were finally able to have our special day. Mrs Britt showed up at the ceremony site early and began working her magic. Everyone enjoyed watching her paint such a beautiful moment from our ceremony live during the reception. Of course, I will never forget how happy I was the moment I saw your masterpiece in completion. I think the attached pictures are worth a thousand words about what I was feeling in that moment. Thank you for creating such a beautiful piece of art for me and my husband. It hangs above the mantle in our home and I smile and think of you and all of the wonderful memories from that beautiful day. If any of you are interested in live wedding paintings, Nicole Britt is your lady! You will hire an artist but forever have a precious, talented friend.

This band blew everyone away and had the dance floor full and happy the entire night. Everyone was smiling and singing along. They were so much fun and incredibly talented. The horn section was a favorite! They were so easy to work with and accommodated all our requests and even some last minute changes. Highly recommend!
