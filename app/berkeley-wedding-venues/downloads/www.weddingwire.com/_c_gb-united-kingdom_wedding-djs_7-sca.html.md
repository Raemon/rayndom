Taken from our website Dear Magi & Team, Just a little note to say thank you for the fantastic job you did as DJ's for our wedding at the Chateau in June. As you were there I don't really need to tell you how much our guests enjoyed the show. All the music you played was fantastic and just what we wanted the 60's 70's Style suited our friends and our age group. With best wishes, Bob & Katie Johnstone. France.
