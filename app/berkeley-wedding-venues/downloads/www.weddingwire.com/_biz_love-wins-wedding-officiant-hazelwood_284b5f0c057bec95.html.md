If it is in the power of the 3 of us working together, your wedding truly can be everything you've always dreamed it could be.

Diana is the BEST EVER!!!

Stumbled upon Diana by doing a Google search for our wedding officiant; I could not consider myself happier or luckier to have done so! Diana is an amazing communicator, she is kind, compassionate, empathetic, truly cares about you and your partner, and does whatever it takes to ensure you have the best wedding day you possibly could. I am so grateful she officiated our wedding. Thank you so much Diana!

Best Day of My Life

Im a few months late but Diana made my beautiful wife and I a day I will never forget she was very helpful from the moment I contacted her she went above and beyond to ensure our day was extremely heartwarming and special and I’m extremely grateful my bride was running late and she put me at ease and waited much longer than she was contractually obligated too very professional and we are forever grateful for all you did !!! Definitely would recommend her 1000 times she WILL NOT DISAPPOINT!!

The Best Officiant You Could Ask For! 

I truly cannot say enough wonderful things about Diana! From the very first phone call, my husband and I knew she was the one we wanted to marry us! Diana is a such a vibrant, gentle, thoughtful, kind, and caring soul, and she truly pours her whole heart into making your wedding the most meaningful, personal experience that you'll treasure for the rest of your life. No question is a silly question during your planning process, and she is so remarkably helpful in both explaining the ceremony process, as well as important legal information. Diana truly gives you a customized experience and genuinely cares for you, your spouse, and your wedding on a personal level and wants to see you overflowing with joy on your wedding day; and our wedding day absolutely was the most joyful day of my life! There were no time limits or limited sessions in planning our ceremony together, and she always melted away any stress I might have been feeling from other aspects of my wedding planning. She was also extremely accommodating about last-minute changes regarding the wedding party, family circumstances, and even elements of our ceremony content. Diana is also amazingly responsive in all forms of communication, and I never felt disconnected from her at all.   
  
I also have to thank Diana for how compassionate, patient, and kind she was as my husband and I had to cancel our original wedding date in 2021 and reschedule into 2022 due to COVID. I'm sure the pandemic wasn't easy on her either, yet despite this she remained remarkably kind and empathetic. Our wedding day was truly magical, and I owe so much of that to Diana. Thank you for being such a joy during the stress of wedding planning, for always offering my husband and I such thoughtful advice, and for being such a burst of sunshine during the chaos of the pandemic. We are so glad that Diana will always be a part of our wedding memories! Honestly, if you're still looking for an officiant, look no further!

Beautiful service, all of my guests still talk about it

Diana is such a joy to work with. She felt like a sister to me from the very first phone call. She was the number one vendor of mine that my guests asked and raved about!  
  
My husband and I are not religious and we did not want any mention of religion and wanted to play on some of the traditional sayings like when the bride is given away by the father. She already had alterations to pick from and no one listening was the wiser. If anything, it made things so much sweeter. Just, if you are a bride or a couple that want the traditional feel to your ceremony, but you just want some phrases to not sound so old-fashioned, Diana is your gal!  
  
She was extremely professional, firm with our bridal party and family members about how they should act on our day, but one of the warmest souls in the room. Her speech reached everyone's ears and hearts. She got me to cry on our rehearsal day (not hard to do) and made my husband glassy-eyed at our wedding which is a feat! Even the best man admitted "Damn, she's GOOD" haha  
  
We opted in for her clock ceremony and now we have a beautiful piece to remember our day by. Thank you Diana for everything :)

I have booked Diana for our officiant, she is so friendly and I cannot wait for my ceremony with her. She is very personable and for us what sealed the deal was here being aware of autistic children and non verbal etc.   
  
By far amazing ceremony. So very caring, not too short and not too long. Loved the ceremony. The Clock ceremony was wonderful and powerful. I absolutely loved Dianna. She is an amazing, caring individual.
