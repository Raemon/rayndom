We used event rents through our caterer but did a fair amount of communicating with Kris. You never know if vendors will be a little jaded or all business or what. But what lovely people! You get a sense that they are truly happy to be helping you on your big day. Kris was super flexible, came out to the backyard we were having the wedding at to advise us. He wasn't pushy at all, wanted to make sure we got the most bang for our buck, and was quick to respond with any and all questions. They even delivered early so we could set up in the backyard ourselves. I'm so grateful our caterer works with them, and connected us. It's a relief to have such lovely people on our side. Thank you for all you did!

We had such an incredible experience working with A La Carte Rentals for our wedding! From the very beginning, Joann was so wonderful, patient, and accommodating — especially as we made multiple changes leading up to the big day. When an unexpected storm rolled in (not exactly normal for the desert in October!), Joann went above and beyond to help us pivot our setup and ensure everything still looked beautiful and stayed dry. Her communication was top-notch, her team was prompt and efficient with setup and takedown, and their attention to detail made everything run so smoothly. When the chargers I had originally requested weren’t available, Joann surprised us by upgrading to stunning gold-rimmed glass chargers with matching plates — such a thoughtful touch that elevated our entire tablescape. They truly had everything we needed — from the huge tent to keep us dry, linens, chairs and tables to outdoor games — and their service exceeded every expectation. I’m so grateful for Joan and her amazing team at A La Carte Rentals for helping make our wedding day absolutely perfect. Highly recommend!

JMS Tents have been apart of 4 weddings in the past decade at our Maricopa ranch. They have never failed us and went above and beyond& beyond to make sure everything on their part is perfect for us. I will always recommend them, and if there's ever a 5th wedding at our ranch, we will call them immediately. A+A+A+A+A+

We used Tyler's custom designs for our florist for our wedding on 11/16/19, they did an absolutely amazing job! My bouquet was so beautiful, as well as my bridesmaids bouquets, boutinerres, and corsages. They did our centerpieces, garlands and general florals around the venue! They came early with a group of 4 ppl and did a beautiful job decorating everything. I dealt with Karen and Brenda, both very kind. And it was very reasonably priced. I would highly recommend!

We had an after-hours event where we needed a curtain set up, the team that delivered it showed us how to set it up. The delivery and pickup were super easy to coordinate.

We had about 200 guests, so we ended up ordering 28 large round tables, 1 small rectangular table, 1 small round table, 4 bar top tables, 2 tables for the bar tender, about 200 chairs for the ceremony location, about 200 chairs for the reception location, table cloths for each table, and a big tub for bottled drinks. They had a wide variety of colors to choose from for the table cloths, and the woman we worked with was very helpful in helping us decide what we needed, what wasn’t actually necessary, and what would look best. We’ve used them for a handful of occasions and have never been disappointed with them.

I rented linens from Fabulous Linens for my April wedding and loved them! Tamiko, the owner, was very responsive and helped me for many months prior to making a commitment to her business. She was very professional and always gave me different quotes or made revisions to my order until right before the wedding. The only thing that I wasn't 100% happy about was that a couple of my tables were not fully covered with linens because they didn't ask for the length of the longest tables prior to setting them up for my wedding. This could have been avoided by communicating with my wedding coordinator and myself. Otherwise, I think that Fabulous Linens did a great job!

DO YOUR GUESTS A FAVOR We had a large guest list and knew traditional favors would add up quickly. We decided to roll our favors budget into an on-site photobooth. It was something to fun to do at the reception and it gave everyone something personal to take home. The Bonus: Arizona Photobooth put together an album for us on the spot that was filled hilarious photos and touching well wishes, much better than a formal guest book! It was a home run all the way around. One of the best parts was seeing everyone's photos from our wedding on their fridge for the next few months!
