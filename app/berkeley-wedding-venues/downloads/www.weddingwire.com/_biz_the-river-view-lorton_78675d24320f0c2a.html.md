10/10 Experience

We are so glad we chose The River View at Occoquan for our wedding. From the start, Hannah and Elizabeth were wonderful to work with. They were kind, flexible, and really took the time to make sure we felt comfortable with every detail. During our final walk-through, Elizabeth’s calm and reassuring approach helped ease any last-minute nerves.  
  
On the wedding day, the entire River View staff was outstanding. They were professional, attentive, and made sure everything ran smoothly so we could enjoy the day without stress. The venue itself is beautiful, spacious, and set in a gorgeous location by the water.  
  
We also worked with Great Blue Heron Catering and could not have been happier. Liz, the catering manager, helped us accommodate several dietary restrictions with ease, and the food was delicious. The chef even came out to greet us and personally brought our meals, which was such a thoughtful touch. Brooke, the banquet manager, worked seamlessly with our wedding planning team to keep everything on track.  
  
We would recommend The River View at Occoquan to any couple looking for a stunning venue with an incredible team.

A perfect venue!

We knew we wanted to book The River View the moment we stepped inside, and never doubted this decision throughout the entire wedding process. The outdoor spaces (the river, docks, kiln, patio, lawn) provided great views and a wonderful canvas for creative wedding photographs. The indoor spaces feel gigantic with their high ceilings and windows. The venue is a great option if you have guests with mobility issues, since it’s all one level. Getting-ready rooms were great. The drive-up to the venue through the park is beautiful. The venue staff was responsive and always had answers to our questions. Great Blue Heron Catering (built-in) provided a delicious meal (and the APPS!). We got tons of compliments on both the venue and the food!

We are thrilled with our choice of The River View for our wedding! From the moment we stepped onto the property, we knew it was the perfect place for our wedding day. The stunning views and beautiful space provided a breathtaking backdrop for both our ceremony and reception.  
The venue and catering staff were incredibly helpful and attentive throughout the entire planning process. They ensured everything ran smoothly on the day of the wedding, which allowed us to relax and enjoy every moment. The venue was impeccably maintained, and the setup was exactly how we envisioned it.

The best day ever!

River View is an incredible Northern VA wedding venue! It really is one of the only venues that fits a larger amount of guests and knows how to work with bigger groups. They were so easy to work with leading up to the wedding and so willing to help.  
The day of it rained and they were so quick to help us with the rain plan. The space is really stunning and our guests loved it.  
The food and bar package is super reasonable and really good. Their service was AMAZING!   
We were blown away. We are so glad we went with them and would absolutely recommend!

Dream Venue on the Occoquan River

The River View at Occoquan is an absolutely stunning venue in a pocket of Northern Virginia we didn't even know existed (until our wedding planner suggested it to us as a potential wedding site and ultimately was the perfect location for our big day).   
  
River View offers the intimacy for a private wedding, while easily accommodating 150-200 guests, and provides the perfect backdrop of the Occoquan river for any outdoor ceremony/event. We were so impressed by the food, the service, and the overall experience provided by the team!   
  
Despite the logistical challenges of planning a Virginia wedding from the West Coast (we live in Los Angeles), it was a smooth process working with the River View team. We were very impressed with the responsiveness and high touch support we received from Hannah, Ashley, and the River View staff along the way. They were easy to communicate with and super accessible throughout the planning process and the final weeks leading up to our wedding day, which made the whole experience very enjoyable.  
  
Day-of-wedding execution was seamless, with only a few hiccups that none of our guests were aware of (firepits were not turned on and wine table service was limited). Otherwise, we were very happy with the way our wedding turned out - guests were very pleased with the food catered by the Great Blue Heron team and everyone loved the venue (especially the scenic drive up to the venue )!   
  
Thank you to the entire River View team for making our dream wedding a reality! We will definitely recommend River View to friends and family looking for a wedding venue or event space in the future!

Beautiful venue!

We had such a wonderful experience working with Hannah and the River View team! We had so many changes leading up to out wedding due to Covid and rain, and they were so on top of everything! It is such a beautiful venue both indoors and outdoors!

Beautiful venue and great service

I’m so glad we picked The River View for our venue. The River View and Blue Heron catering staff were all very accommodating and easy to work with. It made planning easy and enjoyable! The location is stunning as well. Our guests loved the park, river, and indoor/outdoor spaces.

This is the one

Beautiful. Spacious. Breathtaking. Once in a lifetime memory that will never be forgotten by us or our guests. Any and all other adjectives that can describe the perfect venue should be used.  
  
The venue was absolutely gorgeous. It was the perfect location for our wedding. We had almost given up and settled on another venue, but we had a feeling that the right venue had to be out there. With River View, you have a capacity of 400+, modern building, incredibly tall ceilings, floor to ceiling windows, waterfront for beautiful photos, pristine wooden floors, gold chiavari chairs, amazing team (Cori and Fern), exclusive caterer Great Blue Heron (who nailed all the service and food), and the list goes on and on.

Amazing venue!

We loved our wedding at The River View! It's a gorgeous site with delicious food. The coordinating team (Cori, Fern, and Hannah) were all so pleasant to work with and very responsive (including Liz, the catering contact)! The venue's team has an organized system and timeline. We felt fully supported by their efforts. We are so happy that we chose to have our wedding at The River View. P.S.- The food actually tasted better than when we had it at our tasting.

Absolutely amazing experience from start to finish

If you pick River View, you will not be disappointed. The venue itself is absolutely a dream, but Cori and Fern definitely make it worthwhile. They were always so responsive and so helpful, even offering us things the venue just had from over the years. Their added guidance was/is unmatched.   
  
The Great Blue Heron is the caterer for all of the Nova Parks, and even though they are an automatic booking their services are also top notch. Every person I talked to after the fact raved about how delicious the food was.   
  
Overall, if you are considering River View - pick it, you won't regret it.
