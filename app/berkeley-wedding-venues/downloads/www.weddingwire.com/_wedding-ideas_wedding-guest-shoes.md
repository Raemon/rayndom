### Winter Wedding Guest Shoes

While the weather is cold outside, the ceremony and reception will likely take place inside, so you can still rock high heels and open-toed shoes. One way to make your kicks seasonally appropriate is to pick specific fabrics (velvet, leather or satin) that capture the feel of winter. Still, it's always good to keep your feet warm as you travel to and from the wedding, which is why we picked out sensible (but chic) winter wedding guest shoes for you.

There's a reason Carrie Bradshaw was obsessed with her Manolo Blahnik's on _Sex and the City_. The elegant pointed-toe heels have a walkable four-inch heel and a cushioned footbed—plus they were made in Italy. If you're nervous about keeping them on late into the night, bring a pair of foldable flats in your purse.
