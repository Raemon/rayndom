Amazing venue. So many good memories! 

We loved this venue and all our memories from our wedding. We worked with Narod who helped in all communication. We also got help from Ryan in AV. They were both so easy going and great to work with!  
  
We loved how beautiful the setup is. The ceremony outside was so nice. The Redwood Hall is also so gorgeous for photos and fun for dancing. We also really liked the cocktail area. We got an animal ambassador and guests had fun seeing the ferret and kestrel. We got nothing but compliments related to how fun the venue was. We are so happy we chose this place for our wedding. We loved the experience. Thank you to CuriOdyssey for going above and beyond. From communication early on to day of. It was amazing!

Incredible Venue!!

We're so happy we chose CuriOdyssey as the venue for our wedding. We held our ceremony at the Merchant Marine Memorial Overlook in the adjacent Coyote Point county park (beautiful views!), which allowed for a seamless transition to the cocktail hour and reception at CuriOdyssey. All of our guests, from the toddlers to the grandparents, commented on how amazing and unique the venue was. The staff were all extremely kind, patient, and helpful in ensuring we had every detail covered and every unexpected issue sorted out on our big day. Narod is an absolute angel!

Unique and entertaining venue!

We loved CuriOdyssey! Our guests never got bored with the zoo animals and interactive science displays. The reception in Redwood Hall overlooking the bay was beautiful as well. James and his team gave us advice on lighting, timing, and music, and they always responded promptly which made planning so much less stressful.

I would like to thank the CuriOdssey for making the Chang/Chow wedding a huge success last weekend. Their team was extremely polite, personable and accommodating to all of our needs, including our last minute requests. As the day-of coordinator, I really appreciated their responsiveness via email ahead of time and their flexibility with our ever-changing requests.   
  
The Redwood Hall was such a cool venue space. It is extremely well maintained! We had amazing views of the bay and SF and was a perfect venue for the wedding.

We began planning our reception with the event coordinators at CuriOdyssey in November 2016. We were married four days ago and are on cloud nine, we couldn't be happier with how all parts of our special day came together. We attribute a good part of our success to Janan and her team. We literally had over 5 different venue walk thru's and over two dozen email communications before all was said and done. The staff at CuriOdyssey never once delayed a response or discouraged coordination efforts. Our event turned out beautifully, ran smooth and most importantly our friends and family had an amazing time celebrating US!! This is a venue to be considered for your special day!!

This is a wonderful wedding venue on the Peninsula that has a lot of personality, yet remains affordable. All of the staff at CuriOdyssey were very professional and accommodated all of our requests. If you choose this venue, I highly recommend having a cocktail hour in one of the outdoor areas and choosing one or two animal ambassadors to attend. We chose the great horned owl and blue-tongued skink. Our guests had a great time, and it was especially fun for all of the children!

We held our wedding and reception at CuriOdyssey in April 2016, and the staff there made it an absolutely amazing experience.   
  
We worked primarily with Ali in the lead up the event, with Janan also working with us in the month prior. Both were very responsive, and incredibly helpful. We can't stress enough how much we loved having our wedding there, and what a great time all of our guests had.   
  
Prior to booking our reception there, Ali answered a bunch of our questions, and had so much helpful information for us on pricing, options, and vendors. The pricing was very reasonable considering that it's the Bay Area, and while they have a list of vendors they recommend, they are fine with you bringing in others as well. We went with one of their recommended caterers, which was a great experience for us because both parties knew each other very well and did a lot of the coordinating for us.   
  
We rented the Redwood Hall (1 level), which also included use of the Gardens (and all of the animals!) until dusk, and the use of the museum until the end of the event. We had so many compliments from our guests about how much fun they had, and how they loved seeing the animals. We also had a handful of children at the wedding, who loved the experiments and the animals. It was a fun great alternative to just dancing all evening.   
  
One of the biggest things was in the week leading up to the wedding - we did a walk through a week ahead of time with the caterer, Janan, and Ali, and they were very organized and helpful. It was threatening to rain on the day of the wedding, and Janan allowed us to use a second level of the hall as a contingency plan (for free!) in case it did rain and we needed to have our ceremony inside (we had it at the Merchant Marine Memorial which was BEAUTIFUL). Also, we were able to drop off a bunch of items to day prior to the wedding and both Janan and Ali were very accommodating.

Amazing and beautiful

My partner and I had a winter wedding just last month (January 2019) and it was absolutely perfect. We rented the entire Redwood Hall and had the ceremony as well as the reception there. The event manager, James, was absolutely phenomenal and was a fantastic communicator. He was really great at keeping us on time and then on the day of the ceremony getting the animals to come so we could take photos with them.   
  
The venue itself is so gorgeous and perfect for us since we had about 60 child guests. Perfectly situated in a regional park, the photo opportunities were endless! We 100% recommend this venue!

The staff at CuriOdyssey was incredibly nice and accommodating. We had a weekday wedding during the slow season and had a relatively easy time organizing everything with the venue. Despite not being open Monday, some staff was there to help us set up our decorations. They allowed us use of almost the entire museum and let us come to visit for free as many times as we needed when planning. During the events of the day I (the groom) had to navigate the museum without seeing my bride. This was easily made possible by having the ability to hide in their classroom area where I got ready.   
  
Other than being a little slow on email, everything went smoothly. I would highly recommend this incredibly beautiful venue to anyone. The price was right for us and being in a beautiful natural preserve, the wedding was a dream. The grounds surrounding the venue are wonderful, the bay in view, and the RedwoodHall a wonder.
