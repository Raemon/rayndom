Engagement Party

My husband and I had our engagement party in Kairos Hall at the Danville Congregational Church. It was a lovely party where many of our friends and family gathered to celebrate our upcoming wedding. The space was light and bright, and DCC was easy to work with, accommodating all of our needs. We highly recommend them!

Beautiful sanctuary--great value for our reception!

We held our wedding in 2017 at Danville Congregational Church, and it was a magical experience! The gorgeous sanctuary set the stage for our vows, and the pastor and wedding host were very attentive to our needs. We appreciated that DCC is an Open and Affirming church, and made our wedding so special. We also were really pleased with the lower costs for the venue--as public educators, we were on a tight budget for this, and it was extremely affordable. Thanks, DCC!

Wonderful Wedding Experience

We were so happy with our wedding at DCC! This church was so welcoming to us. Pastor Eric took the time to get to know us before officiating our ceremony and was open to collaborating together to write it. The sanctuary was so beautiful it hardly needed any additional decorations, we just brought a flower arrangement for the altar and that was it. I particularly love the rainbow stained glass windows (this church is LGBTQ+ friendly). Music from both the organ and piano really added a special touch to the ceremony. We had a light reception afterward on the patio and adjacent hall and our guests loved it. Our experience with everyone involved was so smooth.
