Obsessed with my buoquet!

Gayle was a dream to work with! We had a sit down consultation with her, planned out everything, she informed me of what flowers are in bloom/available for the month of my wedding. She let me know I can update my order if we needed to add or change anything. About a month before my wedding, I wanted to change all of the flowers. Gayle stayed on the phone with me as I walked her through my Google Slideshow and stayed honest with me through the process. A few days before my wedding, the flower I had chosen was not available (she had told me this was a possibility) and she worked with my husband to add the right touches to make my bouquet and other arrangements perfect! Gayle brought them to my venue, problem solved some logistics for hanging some flowers, and made sure everything was set up. I would 200% recommend Blossoms by Gayle for your floral needs.  
  
(Having trouble uploading pictures but they were my dream arrangements!)

Wonderful service!

I was thoroughly impressed with Gayle from our initial encounter. Her genuine enthusiasm for her passion and dedication to ensuring the bride's satisfaction was evident from the start. She graciously accommodated my requests for adjustments to my bouquet, and her professionalism and flexibility were truly commendable. I wholeheartedly recommend her services to fellow brides.

Great Experience! 

Gayle did an amazing job on the floral arrangements for our wedding! She was extremely accommodating, and thorough, and went the extra mile to ensure the bouquets were just perfect. She sent me photos of the bouquets the day before to make sure everything was just right. She even provides vases for each bouquet so my bridesmaids and I were able to have our bouquets at the dinner table with us.

Excellent service 

Blossoms by Gayle was referred to me for my October wedding. I reached out and ask for a quote based on my budget. Gayle quickly replied and was so nice on the phone. She let me know what ideas she had based on my wedding details and budget. We appreciated every step of the service from the texting for any questions or concerns to the pictures of the flowers we wanted. We are so thankful for Gayle’s service!

Would highly recommend 

Gayle designed my bridal bouquet and all of the florals for my bridal party of 14. She was absolutely fantastic through the entire process. I do not know much about florals and I struggled with deciding on arrangement that would suit my wedding style the best. I showed Gayle my colors and my dress and she designed the most beautiful bouquet. She was very communicative throughout the entire process and I would highly recommend.

Wonderful & Amazing 🤩 

Gayle was a dream to work with. She worked with my budget and my ideas and she truly made my dream bouquet. I loved that she asked very detailed questions and made sure to write everything down. The way she treated me was not like a client but as id I was a friend. 1000000% would recommend to anyone who needs a florist!
