# Found my dream dress, now on the hunt for bridesmaid dresses...

I’ve found my dream wedding dress at GLAMLORA, it is everything I want. I am waiting for it.

But unfortunately their bridesmaid dress collection doesn’t have what I’m looking for. So now, I’m on the hunt for 8 different bridesmaid dresses that fit the same vibe but aren’t identical. I’m thinking of going with a deep wine or burgundy color. 

Does anyone know any websites that might have what I'm looking for? Thank you!

I do not recall anyone saying the results of their purchases from Glamlora here. A bunch of reviews are totally on the negative side but your experience may not be like that. Hope it works out for you.

Just do a search for reviews on the online store. One reason to be cautious about any store is when there is no address and phone given for their company. I do not have personal experience so I can only recommend getting background information before buying a dress there. That helps for any store.
