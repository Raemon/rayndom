If you’re on the fence about hiring someone for planning or day or coordination like I was, absolutely DO IT and choose Brittany! I did most of my wedding planning by myself at first. As someone who had a very specific vision and can be a little bit of a control freak, I wasn’t sure if I wanted or needed to hire a day of coordinator and was worried about trusting someone else with my vision. However, I am so so glad I decided to go with Brittany. Hiring Brittany was by far the best planning decision I made! She was incredibly professional, detailed, and brought the best vibes! I found her through wedding wire and she got back to me so fast! Communication through the whole planning process was so quick and easy, she was quick at responding every time I reached out. She executed my vision perfectly and put together decor on the fly for tables I completely forgot about. She took off so much anxiety by standing up for me while dealing with conflicts with other vendors and doing all of the last minute communication the week of. This gave me more time to rest and spend time with my loved ones before the big day! I also only heard great things about her from my other vendors, they also said she was so easy to work with and made their days easier as well. Despite a few hiccups the morning of (that were not her fault), I was able to have an absolute stress free day knowing she was taking care of it. I am so glad I used her day of coordination services to have more time with my fiance and family. Absolutely recommend!

Even to the extent of going to get the groom one thing he forgot to bring HIS UNDERWEAR!!! I am stilled getting complements on how polite, helpful and professional the team was that day! Thank you again team!!

I can't recommend Ashley and her team (especially Corrine) enough! We had a tough venue - and venue manager - to work with, but Ashley coordinated everything with grace and a smile. She knew all the right questions to ask and the best vendors to hire, always taking our budget and personal preferences into account. Better yet, she navigated my mother's and my often opposing opinions! I can't imagine what we would have done without Make My Day - Ashley put us completely at ease throughout the whole planning process and the entire wedding day. My favorite thing was her all-encompassing wedding weekend timeline - my whole family kept referring to it and everyone stayed on schedule!

I am an officiant who worked with Proud to Plan on a recent wedding. I work with a lot of vendors and get to see how they are 'behind the scenes'. Erin Proud and her team are the best. They are completely organized, with every detail covered. They are easy to work with and make sure to attend to every aspect the wedding.

I would like to say that Heaven Sent Wedding Consultants is by far the best party planner I have ever interacted with. Heaven Sent Wedding Consultant handled my daughter's sweet 16 birthday party. I was amazed and filled with such surprise with the flower arrangements, the decorations, the lighting which Christina Maddox and her crew handled. The events that took place that evening Christina Maddox and her crew handled in such a fashion, that there were no issues or problems the whole night. It was all on point and absolutely perfect, from the recommendation of the caterer, to the flowers, to the photographer, and to the DJ, all of it. My friends, my daughter's friends, and our family were so impressed and full of compliments. Most importantly my daughter had an awesome and wonderful time, which she will remember being the greatest birthday. Thank you so very much Heaven Sent Wedding Consultants.

Debbie is a life saver. She gave my husband and I the wedding we wanted and even more. She was very helpful in each aspect of planning and also on the day of the wedding. I could relax knowing that everything would turn out because Debbie was taking care of it. We had a change in venue and the venue we chose was in the process of being built, so there were bumps along the way, but Debbie handled them very well. I would highly recommend her to any couple who is looking for a wedding planner.

Felicity was such a huge help on the day of the wedding. We were working from many miles apart and the regular skype meetings and calls and in-person meetings gave me a sense of security that everything would go according to plan.. and if it didn't, she would figure it out and make it feel perfectly seemless to me (the bride) and the guests. I am SO happy I hired her for my wedding! I highly recommend!

Hiring SocialFly Events for our event coordinating was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding, I cannot emphasize this enough. Gwen was so incredibly organized and was so much more than a day-of coordinator! She scheduled phone calls with me throughout the planning process to keep my planning on track, prompting me to think about details I would have previously missed. Gwen even came to check out the venue with me, just so she could get the details of what I wanted. She made thoughtful suggestions on what to add to make our day flow perfectly. Before our wedding, Gwen contacted our vendors and made it clear that she was the point-person for the day of and called in for the final phone calls with the vendor, running through the details with them. She attended the wedding rehearsal, which helped organize everyone so that the actual wedding day went smoothly. On the wedding day, she brought a team with her that was able to help set-up and take-down decorations. I did not have to deal with any details, other than enjoying myself! Gwen helped with the décor, managed the vendors, assisted the guests, and made my perfect wedding a reality. She truly thought of everything and then some! She even met up with me the day after the wedding to ship back some items that had been missed. In addition to her organization and thoughtfulness, she was a pleasure to work with and consistently positive and professional!

Linda at Afflair was extremely helpful to both me (MOB) and my daughter. In addition, I felt she was fairly priced and worked with us in terms of budget options for using her. She was a lifesaver at coordinating with vendors and great at making sure everything was smoothly handled on the day of the wedding as well as leading up to it. I never hesitated to email her with questions and she always was prompt at responding. She was also very easy to get along with. I would highly recommend Linda as a wedding planner.
