I ordered some candy molds that I wanted to use as my favor. I took the molds to Old KY Chocolates and they made the candies exactly like I requested. They used the correct colors, packaged them, and they were ready promptly. Candies tasted excellent!

We ordered 3 types of candy for our favors with a local flair: bourbon balls, milk chocolate in the shape of fleur de lis, and modjeskas. They were prepackaged by Muth's and I got to select the packaging, label, etc. The ladies at Muth's are fantastic and everyone loved the candies. Muth's has been around for a long time, and their customer service and products indicate how they've been successful over the years.

Art Eatables has made a reputation for themselves in the bourbon corporate world but we were the FIRST wedding of their venue. They have opened up a cocktail version of their bourbon truffles so we asked if they would provide the favors for the reception. They accepted and WOW! They were so good! Kelly (owner) even went above and beyond our request and created two sets of chocolate tea sets to display on the favor table. each teapot had a rose on top of the lid! My daughter's theme was "Beauty and the Beast" so Mrs. Potts had to be a major player and Kelly made it happen! Please Please Please give them a try. They are located on 4th street right down from the Brown Hotel.

It was so awesome having the caricature shop at my son’s wedding!!!! The artist was amazing and did so many caricatures that I lost count. We had over 130 people at the wedding and he was able to do all the caricatures that people wanted. I highly recommend. It was so much fun to have that special touch for everyone to take home!!! Thank you!!!!
