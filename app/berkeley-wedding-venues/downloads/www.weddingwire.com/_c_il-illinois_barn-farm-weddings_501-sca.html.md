From the moment we arrived, we knew this place was something special. The setting was absolutely stunning — every detail, from the breathtaking views to the peaceful atmosphere, created the perfect backdrop for our wedding day. The owners went above and beyond to make everything run smoothly, and we truly felt cared for every step of the way. What made this venue so memorable wasn’t just how beautiful it was, but how it felt — warm, inviting, and full of joy. It will forever hold a special place in our hearts, and we’re so thankful we chose it to begin our marriage. If you’re looking for a venue that combines natural beauty, heartfelt service, and an unforgettable atmosphere, we couldn’t recommend it more highly. It was everything we dreamed of and more. ❤️

We can't say enough what an amazing job the Fishermen's Inn team did for our wedding. From the initial visit, Erin, Patti, Felecia, and team were so kind and personable and took all of the stress out of the planning process. Everything on our wedding day went exactly according to plan, and months later we are still getting compliments from guests on the food and atmosphere. We truly can't recommend Fishermen's Inn enough, they made our wedding day incredible!

We recently had our wedding service at the chapel onsite at Midway Village, followed by the reception at the onsite barn. Not only was the location unique (and not the usual wedding type of reception venue), but it was also convenient for our guests to not have to travel to different locations. The barn for the reception was two stories so that dinner could be served on the second floor, followed by dancing on the first floor, (with an elevator for guests that needed it) so that those that wanted to chat could do so upstairs, while others could dance and listen to music downstairs. Our wedding was in the winter and staff was extremely helpful in carting guests to and from their cars due to the snow. In general, the staff was fantastic. From the beginning to end they were quickly responsive and answered any questions we had promptly. Not to mention the price was extremely affordable, especially compared to other venues in the surrounding areas. I was fortunate to have come across this venue and highly recommend it for not only price, but ease of planning, graciousness of staff, and beautiful setting. What more could you want?

We were married here on 7/16/21 and had the very best day ever thanks to our coordinator, Jessica!! The day of our rehearsal, there was a 80% chance of rain for our wedding day. Jessica made us feel at ease and had us rehearse outside as well as walked us through the backup plan. We were lucky enough to be married in the row of trees outside, but I know it would've been just as beautiful inside. Jessica made us feel very comfortable and we were not worried about weather issues at all. We received SO many compliments on how beautiful and unique the venue was, and how great the food was. We are from Chicago and the majority of our planning occurred during COVID - so we had most of our meetings w/CLO staff via Zoom, which was very convenient for our schedules. The staff is so friendly and responsive, they were accommodating of some last minute changes for us- which was highly appreciated. We are beyond grateful that we found this venue and did not opt for any of the venues we visited in Chicago. Also- we had lots of guests come from out of town as well and this location was great with its proximity to O'Hare/Midway. Our guests said this was the best wedding they had attended, we cannot thank Jessica and her team enough! Thank you again Jessica, we truly appreciate all that you did to attend to our needs during the wedding! From getting us drinks to keeping everything on track with the timeline, we couldn't have asked for anything more. We highly recommend CLO to anyone who is looking for a beautiful, unique, and accommodating venue!!

The Pavilion at Orchard Ridge Farm was the perfect venue for our wedding! We had our ceremony outside in front of the pond with the fountain—it was absolutely beautiful and made for stunning photos. The space is elegant and well-maintained, and the staff was professional, friendly, and attentive, making the planning process smooth and stress-free. The food from Henrici’s was phenomenal—our guests are still raving about it! Every detail was taken care of, and we couldn’t have asked for a more perfect setting to celebrate our special day!

We were thrilled with Hoosier Grove Barn! It's cozy, beautifully decorated, and priced right! Who knew you could have a gorgeous wedding without breaking the bank? So many extras included in the price, like all-wedding-day venue accessibility and a 5-hour premium bar! Vicki, Katie, and all the staff worked hard to make sure my daughter had the perfect day. Accommodating, friendly, and communicative, the Hoosier Grove Barn staff were always happy to answer our questions, give a tour, help plan our decor, and provide vendor suggestions (and they have great vendor suggestions!). When we were bogged down in details, they were the calm in the storm, helping us sort everything out. These people know what they're doing!

The venue was absolutely beautiful—everything turned out perfectly! With all of the antiques and décor, we barely needed to purchase anything additional. Scrementi’s food was amazing, and Ruth was incredibly helpful and sweet; the day truly wouldn’t have been the same without her. Our only small downside was wishing the venue could have stayed open a bit later.

We had the absolute pleasure of celebrating our wedding at Hudson Farm on October 3rd 2025, and we truly couldn't have asked for a more perfect experience. From the moment we first toured the venue, we knew it was the one. The delicately balanced combination of rustic-elegance was exactly what we wanted and clearly well thought out. The Barn was a beautiful backdrop for our ceremony and provided strong Midwest historic vibes. The reception hall was elegant and spacious. Hudson Farm truly made the wedding feel real, intimate, and magical. The venue is not only beautiful, but also thoughtfully designed to accommodate every part of the day—from the ceremony to the reception and everything in between. What really set Hudson Farm apart, though, was Dan Hudson. He was incredibly professional, responsive, and supportive throughout the entire planning process. On the big day, everything ran so smoothly—it was clear that we were in great hands. Guests are still raving about when Dan opened the doors in the reception hall to reveal a stunning fall sunset over the countryside. It truly felt magical and we will never forget it. Whether you're planning a big celebration or a more intimate gathering, Hudson Farm truly goes above and beyond. Thank you to the entire team at Hudson Farm for making our wedding day unforgettable. We feel so lucky to have found this gem!

Where do I start?!.. Lindsay was so much help from the beginning to the end! I feel like sometimes when something is booked, after that communication is not always the best and that was not the case with Lindsay. She was always so quick to respond to any questions we had throughout the whole process. The day of the wedding, again from start to finish Lindsay was right there for anything we needed. Her staff she had on the night of our daughters wedding also did a phenomenal job❤️, I would highly recommend The Barn to anyone planning a wedding.

## Wedding Venues in Illinois

From thriving cities to rural hideaways, Illinois is home to some of the country’s most picturesque and stylish wedding destinations. Boasting chic hotels and rustic barns, the Prairie State offers a wide variety of venue options for you and your partner to consider. With a myriad of tourist attractions to complement your experience, Illinois can provide the backdrop for a truly memorable celebration.

## Discovering Illinois’ Richness and Diversity

Famed for its industrial heritage and acres of farmland, Illinois is a vibrant hot spot for couples who wish to tie the knot in the Great Lakes Region. The state’s largest city, Chicago, is a lively social and cultural hub. Nestled on the shore of Lake Michigan, this landmark metropolis features a wide range of banquet halls and hotels suitable for hosting romantic occasions. You can say “I do” on the bank of the lake, or enjoy an elegant reception at a rooftop venue. Should you opt for a countryside getaway, rural Illinois is replete with elegant mansions and bucolic barnyard venues. The average cost of a wedding venue in the Prairie State varies depending on where you choose to wed. Venues in Chicago have a typical price of $9,000, while costs in central Illinois can be as low as $3,000. For budgetary assistance, you and your significant other can make use of our [budget planning tool](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/wedding-budget.html).

## Illinois’ Friendly Neighbor to the West

Situated to the west of the Prairie State, Iowa is a scenic and understated alternative that couples may wish to consider. Like Illinois, the Hawkeye State features both populous urban areas and rustic settings. From idyllic State Parks to the bustling capital city of Des Moines, this state evokes a country-meets-city vibe that is sure to impress nearly-weds. Couples will also be attracted to the region’s reasonable prices. The average cost of a venue in Des Moines is $5,000, a figure that is lower than both the national average of $6,000 and the standard price in Chicago.

## The Prairie State’s Continental Climate

In terms of the weather, Illinois strikes a winning balance. The summer months are typically warm and humid, while winter sees cold temperatures and occasional snow. The fall season can be cold and blizzards are not uncommon during this time.

## Planning your Perfect Day in the Prairie State

  * What should I consider when choosing my wedding date?

Given that Illinois, particularly Chicago, hosts many special events all year round, it is a good idea to keep an eye out for any potentially busy dates. Sporting occasions such as Bears and Cubs games happen frequently, as do public festivals such as Pride Fest. You can use [this online tool](https://go.weddingwire.com/wedding-date) to arrange the date of your big day.

  * What documentation do I need to provide to marry in Illinois?

To obtain a marriage license in Illinois, you and your significant other must go to a county clerk’s office to present a form of identification. Suitable documents include a birth certificate, passport, or driver’s license. Upon approval of your marriage license, you have 60 days to exchange your vows.

  * How do I get to Illinois?

The Prairie State is served by the Midway and O’Hare International Airports, both of which are located in Chicago. Regional airports can be found throughout the state, including the Quincy and Springfield airports. For drivers, several major roads lace through Illinois, such as the I-57 and the iconic Route 66.
