⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Absolute Best Decision We Made! If I could give Laidback Entertainment 10 stars, I would! From the very first meeting, they understood our vibe and promised to keep the party going—and they absolutely delivered. Our dance floor was packed from the first song to the last. DJ Laidback read the room perfectly, mixing in our requested songs with crowd-pleasers that had both our 20-year-old friends and our 80-year-old grandparents dancing all night. Multiple guests told us it was the best wedding music they’d ever heard. If you want an unforgettable party, book them now!

We booked DJ services for our reception at the Top of the Town in Arlington, VA. We reached out to multiple DJs and settled on Chris Styles events as they offered the best rates for packages. We found that Chris Styles was able to secure a DJ for us and give us the rate we budgeted for. They were very professional and understood client relations. While we ultimately didnt pursue the photo booth or dancing on clouds options, we absolutely would have used those if needed and glad they were available. Our DJ (Deejay Distrakshun) was very professional and worked with us directly to build on our needs for the reception. Our wedding was south asian style. The music we played was exactly what our guests expected. I really appreciated at the day of the event, DJ Distrakshun was highly organized and professional and attentive to all of our needs. Everyone loved him and we were so relieved to have chosen him for a very important event in our lives. The music selection was highly attuned and current. Highly recommend reaching out to Chris Styles for DJ services.

I hired DJ Nose for my wedding and he did not disappoint! He was wonderful. He knew how to keep guests on the dance floor and we had all ages at the wedding! During the special dances, he kept eyes on me and waited for my signal to start the song, which was awesome! If you want an energetic DJ that can feel the vibe of a room, DJ Nose is the way to go! @Tammy Rector Photography

TCC Productions was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. Their communication style was clear, concise, and easy-going, which put us at ease throughout the planning process. The quality of their work was truly thoughtful, entertaining, and nuanced. They kept the wedding vibe alive and well by giving amazing commentary through every transition, and did an amazing job when transitioning songs during the ceremony and keeping the audience engaged during the reception. We couldn't have asked for a better DJ to help make our special day truly unforgettable.

Choosing DJ Stavros was the best decision we made! Our wedding night was incredibly fun and beautiful with the help of this amazing DJ. The lighting, the atmosphere, and the MCing was incredible. We continue to receive complements months after the wedding of how amazing the music was and how fun our wedding was. Very professional and open to song/genre choices. You can't make a better choice.

Carl was great. He played all the music we requested. He showed up on time and even stayed an extra 30 mins when we asked. He was a little hard to communicate with initially, until I realized he doesn’t check his email daily - better to call him directly. Definitely would recommend his services for your event.

We had a great time and one thousand percent recommend!

Bryan George Music made our wedding reception absolutely unforgettable. Our DJ was Brian, not to be confused with Bryan lol – he had amazing mixing skills and incredible music selection. From the elegant cocktail hour tunes to the high-energy dance floor hits, he seamlessly read the crowd and kept everyone moving all night long. The lighting and sound quality were top-notch, creating the perfect atmosphere without ever overpowering conversations. We couldn't have asked for a more professional, fun, and talented DJ team – highly recommend Bryan George Music for any couple wanting a packed dance floor! Thank you Brian and Bryan!!
