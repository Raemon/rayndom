Our amazing wedding

Gloria Ferrer is everything we could’ve asked for in a wedding venue. Beautiful views (sits on a hill over looking the vineyards and mountains in the distance), amazing wine (duh), and staff to help orchestrate and plan day of. Everything went off without a hitch. It was so great, it is an annual stop on our anniversary visit to the area.

Wedding of my dreams.

I truly cannot even begin to describe how phenomenal of a wedding location Gloria Ferrer is. For the price, you will not find a more beautiful venue in wine country. Absolutely STUNNING views at both the ceremony and reception sites. My professional photos of the site aren't in yet, but everyone kept talking about the view/venue the entire night, and most of my guests said this was one of the most beautiful weddings they've ever been to. Colleen is also fabulous to work with. Book your wedding here - it was literally the best decision I've ever made.

Gloria Ferrer Vineyards is stunning. Looking back at everything we went through leading up to the wedding I am filled with joy that this beautiful place was our venue. We were met with a hiccup leading up to the wedding. The Tubbs fire in October unfortunately destroyed our original venue. All of our vendors were booked by this time and our budget was set based on the venue fee at our original venue. I had been fortunate enough to work briefly with Colleen previously through my old job. I reached out to her and explained our situation and that all of our vendors were booked and budget was set. Colleen invited me out for a site visit and I fell in love. Gloria Ferrer had a lot of very similar characteristics to what my fiance and I loved about our original venue, Paradise Ridge Winery.   
Working with Colleen was wonderful. She eliminated a lot of stress and worked tirelessly with our wedding planner, Lindsey with Ooh La La Weddings, to ensure it was beautiful. Since they have the stunning cave and expansive tasting room, we opted to have everything inside! We had our ceremony in the cave, moved to the tasting room for the cocktail hour, back to the cave for our buffet dinner, and then back up to the tasting room for the reception & dancing.   
The day of the wedding turned out to be a beautiful day! Even though our events were all inside, the doors to the patio off of the tasting room were open and our guests enjoyed the gorgeous evening inside and out.   
Everything about Gloria Ferrer just makes me feel warm and fuzzy. The ambient, natural lighting in the tasting room, to the coziness and intimacy of the cave, plus the wines are amazing and didn’t break the bank!  
Colleen and everyone at Gloria Ferrer really turned a stressful situation into an amazing evening full of memories we will never forget! Gloria Ferrer is my favorite bubbles now because anytime I drink their sparkling I am reminded of our perfect wedding day!

I don't even know where to begin with Colleen and her staff; Gloria Ferrer was a dream come true!   
  
This was the first venue we visited in wine country and as we left I told my husband that we didn't need to go anywhere else. The following week, we booked them for our wedding in June and it was literally the most perfect venue we could have ever asked for. The staff is amazing, prompt, and friendly, the wine and champagne is delicious, and the event coordinators are flexible and awesome to work with. I had the easiest time planning our wedding here and it turned out absolutely breath-taking. Within the venue there are so many options to choose from, it was like having four venues in one. We got ready upstairs, had our ceremony in the arbor overlooking the vineyard, then we did cocktails on the patio, dinner in the cave, and dancing in the tasting room. It was absolutely perfect, we could not have asked for anything more. Our guests are still talking about what an amazing venue and wedding it was, they were so amazed by the location.  
  
I should mention that we live in Phoenix, AZ, so each time we visited leading up to the wedding, Alex and the bar staff were so welcoming and accommodating; we always left feeling so happy and reassured, knowing we had made the right decision. Colleen and her staff were equally awesome. Even through their remodel, she kept us up to date and sent pictures of their progress. She worked seamlessly with me and our wedding coordinator to ensure the day went off without a hitch. They went way above and beyond their call of duty in helping us and making sure that our wedding was everything we dreamed it would be, and I am so thankful that we were able to work with such incredible people on such a momentous occasion.  
  
We would recommend Gloria Ferrer to anyone looking for a venue in Sonoma, and if we got to go back and do it all over again, there is no doubt in my mind we would choose them again.

If you've ever dreamed of a wine country wedding-look no further. THIS IS THE SPOT. The location is unmatched-the views, the decor, the colors, and the service. Our 70 person wedding was stunning. We didn't have to do very much in terms of decor, the arbor was set up beautifully for the ceremony, and the outdoor terrace provided beautiful views of the vineyard, and the tasting room was perfect for dancing.  
  
The service and coordination was excellent. In the months before, they were incredible to work with over the phone and through emails, coordinating between all of our vendors, and truly putting our minds at ease. The day or services were wonderful as well, they took so many details off of our plate and we were able to relax and enjoy the day. Not to mention, the discount on the wines when booking the venue, and they will chill and serve beer that you provide at no cost. And the wine is top notch, all of our guests commented on the Pinot Noir, and the sparkling wine was perfect for the wedding. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

AMAZING wedding venue, we couldn’t have picked a better place! The views are gorgeous, the wine is delicious, and the space was perfect. The staff did a fantastic job – Colleen and Brittany are amazing and took care of every little detail before and during the wedding. They thought of everything, which helped take a lot of the stress off my shoulders! The arbor is the perfect spot for a ceremony and we can’t wait to come back to visit for years to come! Thank you so much Gloria Ferrer – for hosting our perfect wedding day!

I truly enjoyed working with the staff at Gloria Ferrer. There was a small hiccup in that the wedding coordinator retired without letting any clients know about 8 months before the wedding. But the current coordinator, Brittany, was amazing to work with. She was very flexible, easy to talk to, very responsive and pulled off our dream wedding. The views are amazing, the staff was awesome and I really cannot say more good things about it.

I can't say enough good things about this venue. Brittney and everyone at Gloria Ferrer were so amazing. They let us hang out in the cave the day before to put our flowers together, decorated our tables for us, all in all one of the best experiences ever. Plus, you get the entire property so we were able to have the ceremony on the terrace, cocktail hour in the tasting room, and dinner in the cave. We are still receiving compliments on how fantastic our venue was, and we couldn't agree more! I can't highly recommend the venue and Brittney and the rest of the Gloria Ferrer staff enough!

We wanted to incorporate a wine theme into our Boston wedding. After visiting Gloria Ferrer Winery, we discovered these great champagne filled chocolate truffles. We were able to buy them directly from the winery or through their website (we chose to buy direct in person) and everyone at the winery was very friendly when we went to pick them up. As an aside, we ordered a bunch of wine from Gloria Ferrer for our rehearsal wine reception. The online ordering process was easy and the staff were extremely friendly. When we went to the winery to taste wine for our event they were helpful and provided good recommendations. They also sent a personal note congratulating us on our wedding. For value, quality, and service, Gloria Ferrer cannot be beat.

I had my rehearsal dinner on the Terrace of the tasting room of Gloria Ferrer. It is a wonderful setting with amazing views. I worked with Laurie who was fabulous. She was so nice and accommodating and fun to work with. We had a wonderful rehearsal dinner. I wanted a casual, mix and mingle event, and it was perfect for it. It would have been easy to go more formal in the space as well, but it worked great for what I had envisioned. I had many out of town guest who travelled from many other states and countries, so it was a great wine country experience for them. It worked out great and we received so many complements on the choice of venue with such an amazing view. And the wines were great as well.
