My husband and I absolutely loved working with The Pothos Parlor for our wedding! We weren’t interested in incorporating traditional florals, so Lilly’s live plants and rattan stands were the perfect complement to our ceremony and reception spaces. The planning process was thorough—she took the time to visualize and map out our spaces and made thoughtful recommendations that fit our style. On the wedding day, everything transitioned seamlessly. Every potted and propagated plant element was placed and repositioned with care between ceremony and reception spaces and Lilly could be trusted to make decisions on the fly as well. We also loved that there was zero floral or product waste. Since all the plants belong to her and are lovingly cared for afterward, we appreciated knowing our décor was both stunning and sustainable. If you’re looking for a unique, eco-friendly, and truly gorgeous alternative to traditional florals, we can’t recommend The Pothos Parlor enough!

I hired Kelsey for both of my daughters’ weddings, as both the florist and the wedding planner. She surpassed all of my expectations. Her flower designs were even more gorgeous than I had hoped they would be. Her knowledge and talent made the wedding planning process, in particular managing vendors’ contracts, reception setup, and wedding day management so easy on me, that I could really enjoy my daughters’ wedding days! I recommend Kelsey with no hesitation. She is a highly professional Wedding Planner!

I had always wanted to keep my wedding bouquet for years to come. Peggy Lowe made it possible and I am so very pleased with everything. She is friendly and very quick to respond to questions and concerns. It was a pleasure to do business with her. Not only did she preserve my bouquet she took the time to add some of my personal flare to it. When I picked up my bouquet it brought a tear to my eye because it was more beautiful than I imagined!

I had Charese coordinate and provide decor & florals for my wedding in September. Not only was she professional and gracious, but she has an eye for design and decor. She goes above and beyond, even sewing me into my dress moments before walking down the aisle. Couldn’t recommend her or her team of vendors enough. 12/10 every time.

Larson Floral brought my vision to life. Their florals and style of arrangements are beautiful. They are professional, responsive, and personable. They were very flexible and accommodating. I was obsessed with bouquet, and my bridesmaids loved theirs. They looked so beautiful and elegant. They even threw in free cake florals!

Echelon was spectacular. We allowed our florist Matt to have his way with our ceremony flowers overlooking the Smoky Mountains, and he did not disappoint. The flowers are stunning. I couldn't be happier, from my bridal bouquet to the signature boutonniere (for my husband). The consultation left me very confident that he knew what he was talking about. I know nothing about flowers, and he did not make me feel silly. He is professional, and I would wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone who asks.

Rose Hill provided flowers for our 10/5 wedding. I was blown away when they arrived, and am so excited to get my beautiful bouquet preserved! Megan was responsive and helpful throughout the process, and Rose Hill made my wedding pinterest board come to life!

We couldn’t be happier with Lynn Doyle Flowers' incredible work for our vow renewal. The arrangements were fresh and beautifully designed. We had asked them to recreate the essence of our original wedding flowers but with a fresh, modern spin, and they delivered beyond our expectations. They perfectly captured the sentimental value we wanted while giving the arrangements a unique and updated look. The attention to detail was evident. The flowers were beautiful, and the team was wonderful to work with. Lynn Doyle Flowers helped make our special day even more memorable, and we can’t recommend them highly enough for any event!

Thank you Vicki for your patience and professionalism. My daughter got married in Nashville in May. As we did not live in Nashville it was a true leap of faith to arrange the florals for her wedding. Vicki came highly recommend by our planner and the results were lovely.
