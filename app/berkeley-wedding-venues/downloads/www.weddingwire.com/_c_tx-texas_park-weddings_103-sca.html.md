I toured this venue on November 1st, and I was blown away! The staff was so friendly and professional, and the venue itself is absolutely breathtaking. After searching for a year, this is by far the best venue I’ve seen!

We had our wonderful Wedding at the Sereno Estates in Jan 2026. The property was gorgeous and maintained. Very large property with numerous locations to get married. With a fabulous large venue for our dinner and activities. Great outside patio area with many statues and room for a large group. The barn was the best place for our reception. We had a full size bridal's room and groom's room large enough for the brides maids and groomsmen. There were a few ABNB places to stay within walking distance. Chris and Jessica were great hosts and responded quickly. They were very social and helpful throughout the whole process. They provided so much information to assist in ensuring this was a wonderful wedding. TY ❤️

The venue was very flexible and was a joy to work with. We had some unexpected last minute changes and they were quick to adjust and help out. Being able to decorate the day before and have the rehearsal helped the wedding day to not feel so rushed. The gazebo and view of the lake was beautiful! I highly recommend this venue.

I chose the inclusive package offered by this wedding venue, and it covered 80% of the wedding planning. The convenience of having everything taken care of allowed me to truly enjoy my engagement while preparing for the big day. Our energy was focused on preparing for the marriage, not the details of a single event. The venue handled all the details, surpassing anything I could have done myself. From start to finish, they took my vision and brought it to life effortlessly.

We were married 9/13/25 and couldn’t have had a more beautiful wedding! The space itself fit our fantasy fairytale wedding that we were going for and we loved all of the extra packages that the venue offered. We originally had Hannah as our coordinator and she was super helpful and detail oriented in the planning phase. Unfortunately she was ill that day and Brandi last minute was able to step up and took over without any hiccups! She did amazing to make sure our wedding was executed to perfection and was able to give us many chances to eat, drink, and actually enjoy our wedding! We did a lot of the extra packages that they offer and we would 100 percent recommend all of them! The staff at Arrowwood the entire process was amazing and we could not imagine a more perfect wedding ❤️

The most beautiful venue in the DFW area! Having everything in one location is the way to go! We hired Sylvia Massey for our Day Of Coordinator and she was AMAZING. Danielle and Michaela were great at communicating what was needed from us and also listened to our concerns and made sure we were accommodated. We are so grateful to be a part of the Stonebridge Wedding family and will definitely be back for the stunning scenery.

Perfect venue! We had so much fun and so did all of our guests! It was really cool to be able to utilize the whole space - both indoor and outdoor, and customize each part of the ceremony + reception to create a really unique wedding experience. I loved working with Tiffany - she made sure the day went smoothly and we could just relax and enjoy the party!!

We rented the 1890s Church and the grounds for our wedding day. It was perfect. Kim was AMAZING and made everything so easy. My girls and I got ready in the Dodson house - climate controlled, tons of space, and only a short walk to the church!

Everything about our experience with Pam and Michael at Hummingbird Hollow was truly AMAZING! This dream team truly cares about creating the very best for your special event. The property is absolutely gorgeous and allows for numerous options for the perfect wedding ceremony and reception. In fact, we made a weekend event out of it as we also had our rehearsal dinner and welcoming party held at Hummingbird Hollow. The well appointed cottages on site allowed comfort and convenience for the bridal party to stay the night before the festivities the following day. Chef Pam went above and beyond in creating a gorgeous feast for our guests. Everything was displayed beautifully and was absolutely delicious! The entire property is a well maintained majestic garden. It was the perfect place to bring our daughter's vision of her special day to life. Hummingbirds even made the timely appearance during their vows. With the help of Pam and Michael everything came together perfectly! They listened to our wishes for the event and truly did their best to put everything into action. This allowed for a smooth experience. Our time at Hummingbird Hollow is something we will treasure. Thank you!!!

I loved Clark Gardens. This was my pick from the very beginning because we wanted our wedding to feel ethereal and secret garden inspired, lush, romantic, and full of life. We were also going for a touch of Tuscany since that is where we were headed for our honeymoon, and Clark Gardens’ baroque details and Mediterranean inspired landscaping fit the vision perfectly. There are even trees in the White Garden that are the same species found in Italy, and it felt like a little piece of Europe tucked away in Texas. The planning staff was incredible from start to finish, responsive, kind, and truly invested in making our day special. Every question was met with patience and professionalism, and they went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly. The venue itself is beyond magical: peacocks roaming the pathways, butterflies fluttering through the gardens, and sparkling fountains around every corner. It is pure enchantment. The wedding party stayed at The Retreat at Clark Gardens, the guest house on the property, which provided an absolutely calm and serene place to gather during the wedding weekend. It was the perfect escape, quiet, cozy, and surrounded by nature. I felt relaxed and rejuvenated the entire time, and it made the weekend feel even more special and connected. Clark Gardens is truly a hidden gem in the DFW area. The property feels private and peaceful, like you have stepped into another world, and every inch of it is breathtakingly beautiful. Our guests could not stop talking about how stunning it was, and it is no surprise they have now been featured on the cover of British Vogue. If you are dreaming of a fairytale garden wedding, this is the place. I will sing their praises forever. Clark Gardens made our day everything we imagined and more. Book them and make your dream day a reality!
