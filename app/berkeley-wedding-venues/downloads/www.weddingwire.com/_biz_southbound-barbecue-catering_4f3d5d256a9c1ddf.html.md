A no-brainer! A perfect menu for our fall wedding. 

We hired Brad from Southbound BBQ for our wedding, and it was honestly one of the best decisions we made. He catered my sister’s wedding 10 years ago, and we loved it so much that we knew we wanted the same experience for ours. From the start, Brad was extremely easy to work with—responsive, organized, and willing to spend extra time helping us make sure the menu, layout, and logistics all made sense for our venue.  
  
We had an 80-person wedding at a family friend’s home, and he was incredibly flexible with the setup and timing. He arrived right on schedule, had everything ready to go, and all the food came out hot and delicious. Our guests were genuinely impressed—we got so many compliments throughout the night. The grilled cheese and tomato soup shooters were a huge hit (and my personal favorite), along with the brisket, pulled chicken, and bbq ribs!   
  
Overall, it was a great experience: fair pricing, professional service, and fantastic food. We couldn’t be happier. Highly recommend- you won’t regret it!
