Mi boda fue planeada en tres semanas y Bruelee Gourmet fue un completo apoyo. No dudaron en ir hasta arriba en la montaña, en cocinar en un lugar no tan cómodo y aún así ofrecer excelente calidad! Los recomiendo mil!

We recently got married in Santa Teresa and used Drift Bar for the catering (passed apps, dinner, and dessert table) and bar service. We also held our welcome party there the night before the wedding. Everything we ate or drank from Drift was insanely good!! I consider myself a foodie and cocktail snob and I was not disappointed. For the welcome party, we did a taco bar with different fillings (mexican beef, roasted squash, pulled jackfruit, and fish). All of them were outstanding and the salad and sauce pairings were perfect. The passed apps at the wedding were great - people really loved the chicken bao bun and the seared tuna on a rice cake. The star of the meal at the wedding was the Peruvian ceviche, which was not only plated beautifully, but was probably the best ceviche I've ever had. The seared sesame-crusted tuna was also phenomenal. All of their cocktails were made of fresh-pressed juices - they were a hit and so delicious! And the winning dessert was the passionfruit cheesecake!! Still thinking about that cheesecake. But seriously, you can't go wrong with them. All of the food and drink is great quality, their staff was amazing and very professional. We love that we found Drift!! Highly recommend.

We met Torsten through our wedding planner at Bliss Weddings. We couldn’t be more happy with our choice to go with Ono Cuisine. The toughest part was choosing from all the delicious options he offered. From cocktail hour to dessert, our wedding was an upscale dining experience with local flare. Aside from the mind-blowing food, the catering staff was extremely attentive. Do not hesitate to go with Ono Cuisine for your Costa Rican dinner!
