Crissann is an amazing wedding planner/decorator that really exemplifies professionalism and her love for her job is evident in her communication, commitment to her brides and of her decorating style. I tried to plan my wedding from overseas and quickly realized that I was in over my head, in came Crissann stepped in and took full control coordinating the entire day and made it look so easy. From somehow getting the exact shade of red that I wanted for the flowers to calmly letting me know that there was more than enough time to get the venue ready for our event when I arrived at the bridal suite to see tear down of the event from the night before still in process. If you are considering a wedding planner, look no further Crissann is absolutely amazing, and I am forever grateful to her for helping make our day magical and unforgettable.

I’ve always loved Krafted’s decor and was ecstatic to have them do our wedding. Chalene was great to work with, very professional and took the time to understand our vision. I was blown away when I saw the vision come to life….everything was executed perfectly! Working with Krafted was a 10/10 experience. I’m looking forward to using them again for other events.

Describing Chloe is like describing my childhood best friend—she says it like it is, has your back through it all, and isn’t afraid to get things done. Meeting Chloe was not serendipitous; it was meant to happen. I was meant to find her exactly when I did. To give some context, my husband and I were in Jamaica, at the resort we had chosen with our travel agent—the very place we envisioned for our wedding. We had been in communication with the resort’s wedding planner, and while I wanted to believe everything was set, once we arrived and had our meeting, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I had never been married before, let alone planned a destination wedding. As our final day at the resort approached, something just didn’t sit right. I wasn’t convinced my dream wedding would come to life there. To say I was panicked would be an understatement. Panicked about the mediocre food I had tried, panicked that I couldn’t quite picture our special day, panicked that something just felt off. To be fair, the resort’s wedding planner was out that week, but that’s another story! On our very last day, in a frantic search for wedding planners in Negril, I came across Chloe. I read her reviews, stalked her Instagram (among several others), and emailed her. Even though her business was closed on Fridays, she did us the ultimate solid and met with my husband and I the next day. And oh boy, did she save our wedding. I was ready to walk away from the location and our deposit, but Chloe reassured me that she would work closely with the resort and bring my vision to life. That moment was a game-changer. Over the next year, we had countless meetings with Chloe, sharing our vision, and coordinating with all the vendors we contracted. She and her team handled everything—makeup, cake, DJs, décor, and us keep on track with our wedding timeline. We met most of the team virtually, but when we finally met in person, it felt like reuniting with old friends. Fast forward to the wedding weekend. The ChloMo team had some red tape issues with the resort, but that didn’t stop them. They worked their magic. From what we’ve heard, our wedding was one of the biggest productions the resort had seen. Sure, there were small hiccups—my Type A personality noticed them—but in the grand scheme of things, Chloe and her team reminded me that everything was OK. And they were right. On the wedding day—I was ridiculously calm. I almost wondered why I wasn’t feeling more anxious. But the truth was, I had complete trust in Chloe and her team, and they delivered beyond expectations. My bouquet was out of this world gorgeous, and the centerpieces were even more beautiful in person than my vision Pinterest board! Even after the wedding, they made sure our farewell dinner—held off-resort—went smoothly. It was a voluntary invite, and somehow, all 75 guests showed up! The ChloMo team’s presence that night was a lifesaver; otherwise, I might have had a full-blown panic attack. After we got home, my husband shared how much he appreciated the ChloMo team’s mindfulness of my energy on our wedding day. There were a couple of metaphorical “fires,” but they were handled swiftly and seamlessly through transparency and communication with him. Not that he didn’t deserve a stress-free wedding day, too, but let’s be honest—he could handle it better. At the end of it all, they even surprised us with a thoughtful gift, a gesture that truly spoke to their kindness and dedication. Chloe, Anica, Olivia, Ashley—you ladies came through. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you. Brides, if you are planning your wedding in Jamaica, reach out to Weddings by ChloMo team first. Let them guide you to the most magical venues on the island and make your dream wedding come true!

Tropical Weddings Jamaica exceeded every expectation I had. From start to finish, the entire process was incredibly smooth and well-organized, making what could have been a stressful experience feel effortless and enjoyable. Their team was patient, attentive, and always willing to answer questions or accommodate requests, no matter how small. The wedding and reception were absolutely stunning and beautifully set up, thoughtfully designed, and executed with such elegance and care. Every detail came together perfectly, creating a truly magical atmosphere that looked even better than imagined. Guests couldn’t stop complimenting how breathtaking everything was. What truly sets Tropical Weddings Jamaica apart is their affordability without sacrificing quality. They offer exceptional value for money while still delivering a high end, professional experience. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a beautiful, stress-free, and unforgettable wedding in Jamaica. They were also very accommodating when we had a slight issue on the day of the event and we truly appreciate everything they did on that special day.
