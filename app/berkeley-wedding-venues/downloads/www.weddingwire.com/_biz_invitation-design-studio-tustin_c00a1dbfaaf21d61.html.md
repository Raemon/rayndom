The Greatest Asset To Your Wedding or Event!

I truly cannot say enough positive things about Tammie and the team at Invitation Design Studio. I had all the confidence in the world about this member of our vendor team. Tammie is an incredible asset to have by your side throughout the wedding planning process. I learned so much from her about how to have a successful wedding through the design process. Their entire process is also impressively seamless. From beginning to create a vision from the save the date, to making the perfect invite and other signage, to material pick up, every detail was meticulously carried out. The communication was extremely clear, perfectly timed, collaborative, and just generally kind. The design process was easy, enjoyable and personalized. Every single detail is perfect and the quality is amazing. Don’t just have stock printed invites that everyone has, use this one opportunity to create something truly unique for your wedding. This family owned business is committed to excellence in their quality of every aspect of what they do. They are a genuinely kind family who will make you feel so supported and cared for, and will help you with way more than an invitation. I hope that you choose them to create the wedding of your dreams- we are thankful every day!

Hire Them!!!

Do yourself the biggest favor and hire Tammie, and her staff, to design, print and assemble your invitations. She has the expertise and experience to handle all etiquette questions, and my daughter (the bride) learned etiquette rules far beyond just invitation addressing. Tammie shared her knowledge of being in the business for more than 30 years. Her ideas and style are classic, yet chic, and she has more than 100 invitations on display. You get to touch and feel papers, ribbon, envelopes. It’s all there for you to peruse and shop from!

One stop shop! 

Look no further for all your invitation and stationary needs. Tammy can do it all!! She was such a pleasure to work with and came to the rescue when I was in dire need for someone to do my wedding invitations in such a short amount of time. She provided the hands on experience that my husband and I were looking for. We didn’t want to do an online service for our invites, but rather create something unique and personal to my husband and I. We got to hand pick every single detail for our invitations and she truly made our vision come to life. I love that she has such a wide variety of options of colors, styles and everything you could possibly imagine. Tammy is not only the nicest human being ever, but her passion for what she does is so admirable. She made the whole process smooth, easy, and more importantly so much fun from beginning to end. Tammy did our invitations, vow books, and personalized fans for our wedding and helped perfect each one. She is very knowledgeable and provides amazing customer service. She literally is the whole package!! You will not be disappointed she is incredible.

Tammie, the owner of the company, is fantastic at what she does. My wedding invites came out more beautiful than I could have imagined and working with Tammie is a breeze. She knows everything you need to know and more about invite etiquette and formatting and she gets the job done well and ahead of schedule. You will not regret going with her company.

Beautiful invitations

I recently had the pleasure of working with Invitation Design Studio for my engagement party invitations, and I cannot praise them enough for the incredible experience they provided. From start to finish, every aspect of their service was simply outstanding.  
  
First and foremost, the invitations themselves were breathtakingly beautiful. The attention to detail was impeccable, and it was evident that the team at Invitation Design Studio possesses an unmatched artistic talent. The design was a perfect reflection of the style and theme I envisioned for my engagement party.   
  
What truly set Invitation Design Studio apart was their exceptional customer service. Tammie, the owner, was an absolute joy to work with. Her creativity knows no bounds, and she effortlessly guided me through the entire design process. She listened attentively to my ideas and preferences, and her suggestions and insights elevated the invitation to a level I could have only dreamed of. Tammie's dedication to making my vision a reality was remarkable, and her expertise truly shone through in the final product.  
  
Additionally, Tammie went above and beyond by personally taking care of the entire mailing process, ensuring that the invitations reached each guest with utmost care and attention.  
  
I highly recommend Invitation Design Studio to anyone in search of a truly remarkable invitation experience. Whether you're planning an engagement party, a birthday celebration, or a wedding, this studio is the epitome of creativity and excellence. Their ability to transform ideas into works of art is unmatched, and the level of care and professionalism they provide is commendable.

Amazing Invitations!

Tammie's knowledge and expertise made the entire process effortless and stress free. There are tons of invitaion options to choose from and she walked us through everything. Tammie designed our ceremony and reception pieces as well, including hand fan programs, guest seating cards, and menus for our buffet. My wife and I were so glad we found Invitation Design Studio! We got so many compliments from our guests!

Worth it!

My invitations were everything I wanted and more! Tammie was wonderful to work with and coming into her studio was a great experience. You can't beat working with an actual person and seeing your options in person, instead of trying to design something so important online. Our invitations were beautiful and we received so many compliments. Thank you Tammie for everything! I would definitely recommend Invitation Design Studio!
