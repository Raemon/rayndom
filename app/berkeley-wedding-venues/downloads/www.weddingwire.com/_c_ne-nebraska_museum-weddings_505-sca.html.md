The one goal my husband and I had for our wedding venue was that it needed to be amazing on its own, because we didn’t want to pay to decorate a generic reception hall. You can’t go wrong with the Durham! We rented the entire museum, holding our ceremony in the Great Hall upstairs, and our reception Trackside downstairs. Our guests were able to view the permanent exhibits throughout the night, and between the museum and the Soda Fountain, our guests were never bored. Everyone I talked to at the museum was very helpful, and worked seamlessly with our wedding planner (Jen Mrsny with Cherry On Top Events by Jen).

Our reception location was unbelievable! Though it was pretty pricey (and didn't include tables, chairs, dance floor, or anything else - those all had to be rented from an outside company), it was the most gorgeous wedding reception ever. My husband is a pilot in the Air Force, so this was the perfect location! Our guests had exclusive access to the museum for the evening, and even got to ride in the flight simulators! People were talking about how great it was for months afterwards.

Very easy to work with through email -- we live in OR but got married in NE. Everyone we worked with was friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The site was terrific -- a small natural history museum. A similar place in OR would probably cost 2 or 3 times as much. For our small wedding, it was the perfect amount of space.

My wife and I were married at the General Crook House in October of 2019 and I'm so glad we chose to work with them. It's a stunning venue, but more importantly the Douglas County Historical Society and their employees and volunteers were amazingly gracious hosts. It can be difficult finding a venue for a small wedding; we had 35 guests and the General Crook House was the perfect size. We were married in the garden, and had a full dinner reception inside the house, catered by Hy-Vee. Our friends and family loved the beauty and historical value of the venue, including the military museum in the basement.
