We are so happy that we picked Sunset Ranch for our big day! We’re based in Seattle so we needed someone who could help us plan remotely. Ronda was absolutely amazing, she was able to guide us through every detail of wedding planning and built our confidence in party planning along the way. She made planning a destination wedding feel effortless. The venue itself is absolutely gorgeous, the perfect blend of Hawaii’s tropical beauty and wedding-esque grandeur. Our family and friends from both Hawaii and mainland were impressed. It was a little pricier than other places we were looking at but ultimately worth the price. On the wedding day, we didn’t have to worry about a single thing. Ronda and her team kept everything running perfectly and if there were any issues they handled them behind the scenes because we never knew they existed. We were able to be fully present and just enjoy every moment of the best day of our lives.

My husband and I knew we wanted a private location for our wedding and it didn't take long before we realised there were not too many options on Oahu. I did venue tours a year out from our wedding date and after visiting everywhere from Sunset Ranch to the Four Seasons Dillingham Ranch was the obvious winner. This massive private estate ticked all the boxes. While other venues, like Kualoa Ranch, are visually stunning, they lack even remotely comfortable facilities. Dillingham Ranch was beautifully remodelled several years ago so the bathrooms and bedrooms are lovely and well suited for a black tie event. The drive onto the estate will take your breath away and the row of palms in the 'backyard' is beyond photogenic. Dillingham Ranch does lack a robust presence online or on social media and this is indicative of the service you can expect. Siri, the events manager, was ideal to work with but she is not a wedding planner and Dillingham is not struggling to find couples that want to rent the venue. Dillingham will not roll out the red carpet like some other venues but they do not need too, Dillingham is perfect and if you choose it as your wedding venue 90% of the work is done for you as it is picture perfect. BONUS TIP: Across the island shutting times are a nightmare (10PM? how is this acceptable) but because you have sole access to Dillingham, it is possible on occasion to have extended hours for a wedding which is a major bonus so the dancing can continue.

Puakea Ranch was the perfect wedding venue and an unforgettable place to stay for our entire wedding weekend. The property is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views that made every moment feel magical. It was so special to have our closest friends stay on-site, which made the whole weekend feel relaxed, intimate, and full of meaningful time together. The ranch is beautifully maintained, spacious, and thoughtfully designed, offering comfort in a truly unique Big Island setting. From the ceremony to the celebrations in between, Puakea Ranch created an incredible backdrop for memories we will cherish forever. We couldn’t have imagined a better venue and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a remarkable wedding location in Hawaii.

Loulu Palm Farm Estate was absolutely breathtaking and the perfect place for our wedding. I had only done a virtual tour beforehand, and while it looked beautiful online, it is even better in person—truly stunning and it did not disappoint at all. The vendor list provided by the venue is excellent, and I’ve been getting amazing feedback from our guests, as well as from people who have only seen our videos and photos. Everyone keeps saying how gorgeous the location is. Adding Ashley as our wedding coordinator was hands down the best decision we made. She is a must. Ashley helped me so much throughout the planning process, always answering questions and guiding us every step of the way. On the wedding day, when our baker completely forgot to make our wedding cake, Ashley immediately stepped in, coordinated a replacement cake, secured us a full refund, and truly advocated for us. She even encouraged the baker to send an apology gift—we ended up finding a treat box waiting for us at our hotel after the wedding. Ashley went above and beyond, and her support made all the difference. Loulu Palm Farm Estate is a gorgeous venue, and with the right coordinator, it becomes an unforgettable experience. I couldn’t recommend this place more.

This place was amazing. There views are jaw dropping and the scenery is awesome. After doing tons of research online, we really didn't want to get married somewhere very commercialized. This was anything but. It is located in a very ritzy neighborhood with beautiful million dollar homes. So the drive itself was beautiful. Everything was so green and with a beautiful ocean backdrop. Since we planned this from Utah, we were a little scared that it may not be as it seemed. It blew our expectations and was amazing. Crystal, who is in charge of the weddings at the venue, was very professional and a pleasure to work with. She made everything so easy. The price is also unbeatable. It is a very remote and intimate setting and strongly recommend this place.

We held our rehearsal dinner at Kahuku Farms in July. Knowing that things are a bit more country on the north shore we were a bit nervous going into a rehearsal dinner on a farm, but at the end could not have been happier. The set up by the people at Kahuku Farms was amazing. The food was incredible (especially the Char Siu Chicken and the Vanilla Ice Cream). We brought lawn games, music, and some drinks and had an incredible time in the beautiful setting. Our guests all raved about the evening and we could not have had a better night or picked a better place. I would whole heartedly recommend Kahuku Farms as a rehearsal dinner venue.

Thrilled with our experience at Princeville Ranch- from our first email to the moment we said "I do". Our ceremony was on Green Hill which is beautiful, peaceful, and special - landscape of mountains and ocean. I was in awe of mother nature as I was coming up the hill to meet the groom. Pure Joy, Love & Happiness on Green Hill that day. Our guests used the word breathtaking. Our photos are amazing. We were married February 2019 and the weather was a perfect. Planning a ceremony remotely we took a leap of faith and we are so happy we did. We booked everything from the East Coast having never seen the venue. Sarah was professional, accommodating,responsive, and listened to me about our changing guest list. Sarah made it all feel easy. I was really excited when we finally meet in person. She is truly lovely!!!! We went on the horseback waterfall ride a couple of days before and I was able to meet/ride Sarge the horse I would ride up to Green Hill on our wedding day. Pure Happiness!! Everyone at Princeville Ranch gives you the sense that they love what they do. We interacted with the guides, equestrian, ranch owner and even the ranch cats:) Same fantastic experience all around. We had such a positive experience with other activities we did at PR as well. As did our guest we took out on the ATV Off Road Adventure. We highly recommend this venue for anyone looking to be in awe of beauty, gladly received, and enjoy the simplicity of it all. We can not say enough about our exceptional experience with Princeville Ranch, we feel bounded with Green Hill. We will be back again someday. Absolutely Perfect! Mahalo nui loa to all at Princeville Ranch

Had a dozen people at our wedding at CastAway. Everything went as planned. Management was friendly and helpful. Our photographs were beautiful and we were happy with our ceremony. The setting is unique and beautiful.
