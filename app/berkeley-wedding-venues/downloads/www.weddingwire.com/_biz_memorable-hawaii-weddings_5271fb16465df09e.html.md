Michelle is the absolute best! 1000/10 would recommend.

My husband and I chose Michelle to do our elopement because we wanted someone that accepted LGBTQ+ marriages and someone that made us feel comfortable on our big day; Michelle exceeded our expectations. We booked her to be our ordiant about 10 days before the day we wanted to get married, and she accommodated us in so many ways. She made the process so smooth and easy, and was so eager to help us in anyway that she could. We told her what all we wanted and she gave us exactly that+ more. The ceremony was so intimate and peaceful, and she took away all of our stress. Thank you so much Michelle!

Stress-free and affordable experience 

Michelle was there every step of our wedding journey ensuring that everything went smoothly and alleviated any stress. She helped me find a florist who made a beautiful personalized bouquet and accompaniment. As well as the purchase of the permit for a beach wedding. Her prices for wedding packages are affordable and flexible to suit all styles. With hers and Michaela’s assistance we had a traditional Hawaiian wedding which was so special for my husband and I. It was a unique experience that neither of us will ever forget!

Michele is professional and it's the best decision to have her witnessing our ceremony.

Choosing Michele to officiate our wedding was the best decision. She has an infectious warmth and approachability that instantly made us feel comfortable and excited about the ceremony.  
  
Michele is also incredibly professional. She guided us through the planning process seamlessly and ensured every detail was covered. On the wedding day, her preparation was evident; everything ran smoothly and effortlessly. She maintained a calm presence that allowed us to fully relax and enjoy the moment.  
  
The ceremony Michele delivered was not only seamless but truly memorable and deeply personal. We highly recommend Michele to anyone seeking an officiant who is both charismatic and expertly organized!

Our wedding renewal vow ceremony…

Michele was our wedding vow renewal planner and officiant. I reach out to the website after seeing an ad on my phone. Within an hour Michele called me and asked about what we envisioned. She listened attentively and was very engaging and made some wonderful suggestions. As we progressed we shared about our relationship and Michele assisted us with a location for our vow renewal ceremony and what services she thought we make enjoy to make our moment special. We both felt very comfortable and never pressured into anything that we did not envision. Michele looked into some prices of things that we requested and we let her know yes or no if we wanted to go forward. When we finalized our ceremony plans and location we felt confident although we were planning our ceremony from another state on the mainland and had never been to Hawaii before. Michele made suggestions upon our request for restaurants in the area that we could go to conveniently from our ceremony location and also offered flowers if we wanted to be added to our package. The time came when we were in Hawaii and Michele put us to ease about weather predictions and as in contact to check in on us prior to the ceremony day. We felt our ceremony was beautifully written and well put together by Michele and we had no edits, she nailed it perfectly! We had a beautiful vow renewal ceremony and excellent service from Michele. Highly recommend going this route and hiring Michele! You won’t be disappointed!!! Thx Michele!!!

Great service for a reasonable price!

We wanted a simple, small ceremony and Michelle helped us with everything- it was so seamless and efficient, just as we had hoped. She was very accommodating and flexible with meetings and also responsive, which we appreciated with our busy schedules! Definitely recommend!

Amazing wedding officiant

We wanted something quick, private and in office to fit our budget and we got it :)  
Before starting we had a short conversation where she made sure to remember the details we were giving her to add them to the ceremony speach, loved it !  
  
Thank you for being a part of our wedding !

The wedding of my dreams

We couldn’t be happier with the service we received for our wedding. From the very beginning, they were professional, attentive, and truly cared about making everything special. They worked within our budget and still exceeded our expectations in terms of quality and value for money.
