Our wedding took place on May 25, 2025, and it was truly the most unforgettable day of our lives. Held amidst the breathtaking mountains of Orocovis, Puerto Rico, the natural beauty of the surroundings created a magical and serene backdrop that perfectly complemented our celebration. From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the stunning scenery, with lush greenery, mountains, and a beautiful flowing waterfall that added a touch of enchantment to the entire experience. Kalina and Dominick, the owners, were absolutely wonderful throughout the entire planning process and on the day of the wedding. Their warmth, professionalism, and attention to detail made us feel completely relaxed and confident that everything would be perfect. They went above and beyond to accommodate our wishes, ensuring that every aspect of our ceremony and reception was tailored to our preferences. Their dedication and hospitality truly made us feel like we were their only clients. The setting itself was picturesque—an intimate, peaceful location that offered both privacy and natural beauty. The sounds of the waterfall and the fresh mountain air created an ambience that was both soothing and invigorating. Our guests were captivated by the natural surroundings, and many remarked that it was the most unique and beautiful wedding they had ever attended. The entire experience was flawless, from the scenic outdoor ceremony to the charming elegance of the reception area. The natural environment provided the perfect canvas for our vows, and the photos taken here are absolutely stunning. We were able to enjoy our special day in a tranquil, awe-inspiring location that truly felt like a fairytale. We highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a beautiful, intimate wedding venue nestled in nature’s splendor. Kalina and Dominick’s incredible hospitality, combined with the breathtaking mountain scenery and waterfall, made our wedding day a dream come true. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that we will cherish forever. It was the best decision we made for our big day!

Hacienda Campo Rico sin duda alguna fue el venue ideal para nuestra boda. El lugar fue uno mágico en el cual pudimos hacer de nuestro día especial uno diferente y único. Nuestros invitados estuvieron simplemente encantados con lo hermoso del lugar. Adnerys y su equipo siempre fueron muy atentos a nuestros deseos manteniendo una comunicación con nosotros siempre. Definitivamente un lugar muy especial para hacer cualquier tipo de evento uno diferente.

Our wedding at fusion beach villas was like a DREAM, it was all we wanted and more; the process was also so smooth. With my fiance and I having a lot on our plates Elaine made the process and the day of SO smooth and the results stunned us! Our family and us can’t stop talking about how beautiful, organized and fun it went. All details from my bouquet to the decoration, the coordination, the vendors we perfectly picked. We couldn’t have picked a better place and a better person, Elaine. I love flowers and Elaine made the bouquet of my dreams! She worked with us and communication was so clear, efficient, she is responsive, honest and gives great recommendations. The decoration of our wedding was very elegant, the day of all we did was enjoy with our loved ones. Also staying at fusion beach villas was perfect, we are planning going back for our anniversary. Again we couldn’t have picked a better place.
