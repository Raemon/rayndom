8 reviews 5.0 star rating 8/8/2016 I recently got married here at PA Hills Golf & Country Club! This was the second venue I looked into and the very first time I went there was also the moment my husband and I made an instant decision in having our wedding there. We loved the green of the golf course, the open space in the reception area, and the large bar. We had Whitney as our coordinator and she just made everything so easy for me. She was quick to answer emails, answered my billion questions (even if I repeated some), always was willing to have meetings and go over everything so that I had no worries. She always puts your interest before anything, even herself. The day of my wedding,she had a family emergency and she took the time to still show up to my wedding, help me set up, stayed till AFTER the ceremony to make sure everything went smooth. I couldn't have asked for a more attentive, thoughtful, and hard working wedding coordinator. I am so thankful for her and her assistant Katie. Because Whitney knew ahead of time that she couldn't be there for part of my wedding, she delegated everything so smoothly to Katie. Katie was also incredibly helpful and stayed with us throughout most of the wedding to make sure we were good on time and that everything would go smoothly. I thought the staff was wonderful, they helped clean everything up for us after the wedding and safely put everything into one room so that I could pick it up the following day. I thought that that was helpful because I didn't have to worry about bringing anything home the night of my wedding. The venue is gorgeous, I love everything about it, great for photos because of the green. The only thing I'd say is that since it is a member's only club, you have to be aware of the golfers being in your photos. They pay to golf there so it's totally understandable. My husband thought the food was very good. We both had the pork and loved it! Overall, I'm extremely happy with booking PA Hills.

Deciding to have my wedding at the Crowne Plaza Cabaña in Palo Alto, CA, was one of the best decisions I've ever made. The venue is gorgeous, staff excellent, and everything put together helped create a truly magical, memorable day. All of our guests were highly impressed with the wedding and I would do it over again 100x if I could! Thank you especially to Kelsey Krimmer for her expert guidance and support throughout the planning process. Highly recommend!

We had a really great experience with all of the volunteers that work with the Woman's Club. Ginny especially was very timely in her emails back to me (I was very needy as I live in AZ but was having the wedding in CA) and actually had my sister and aunt go visit and check it out. Ginny was great with them, too. Joanne was also very helpful with any questions I had (which was many). I can't stress enough how great it was that the Woman's Club allows you to choose your food, alcohol, etc. It saved us SO much money and was really nice to make it more personalized. My wedding was unforgettable and the best day of my life. And a big part of that was the beautiful site for it-The Woman's Club of Palo Alto.

We held our small reception and ceremony at The Sea in 2016, which left us an excellent impression and memory with all of our intimate friends and families. The room was exactly arranged and set up as what we expected. I especially liked that they have a small patio connected to the room which can be used as a red carpet walkway when the doors are open. The staff there were very gentle, helpful and attentive. Eddie, the manager was very kind and thoughtful. Our communication was smooth and productive. Highly recommend this place as a wedding venue!
