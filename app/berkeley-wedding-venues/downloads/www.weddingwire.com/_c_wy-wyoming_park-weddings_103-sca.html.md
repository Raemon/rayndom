Lakeside Lodge is truly the PERFECT wedding venue! Audrey and Zach made the entire process so easy from start to finish. They were incredibly flexible and supportive whenever little bumps in the road came up, which took so much of the stress out of planning. We loved that our closest family and friends could stay right there in the cabins with us—it made the whole weekend feel extra special and connected. The venue itself is absolutely beautiful; you don’t need much to make it a picture-perfect day. Audrey and Zach were always quick to respond and walked me through every detail to make sure everything matched my vision. On top of all that, it’s so meaningful that Lakeside is a place we can return to and relive those memories for years to come. If you’re looking for the perfect venue in the most perfect location, this is it!

We had an early July wedding in 2025 at Esterbrook Church and the reception at Esterbrook Lodge. The lodge was great to work with. We were able to set up the day prior which made the day of much less stressful. You are able to cater your own food/ drinks. Pricing is very fair with options to add a tent outside if you have a larger number of guest. All three of the lodge owners went above and beyond helping us set up, find great pictures to take, and clean up. They even helped us unload an old classic car we used for pictures... truly went above and beyond. The lodge is a beautiful mountain vibe with lodging near by and I couldn't be happier with how my wedding and reception turned out. I would 100% do it all over again with Amy and the crew!
