We hired him for our wedding cocktail hour and it was the best decision we made. They set a sophisticated and relaxed vibe that our guests are still talking about. The music was at the perfect volume, loud enough to enjoy, but easy to chat over. If you want to add a touch of class to your wedding, book him!"

We are SO glad we chose Versatile for our wedding! Michael, our DJ, was PHENOMENAL! He took the time to really get to know us and what vibe we were looking for and he killed it! Our guests had a blast and we all danced the night away!! John our photographer was excellent! Very friendly and took some amazing shots. He even came through with a crochet hook to help bustle my dress! Brittany our Photo Booth attendant was so sweet and helpful, our guests absolutely loved this feature!! I can’t say enough good things about Versatile!! Thank you so much for making our day so special!

Booking with BME was one of the best decisions made for our wedding! Bob, the owner, was so nice and very responsive. We booked DJ Krazy Kev, a photobooth, and uplighting (highly recommend!). DJ Krazy Kev absolutely killed it!! He brought the energy and everyone was on the dance floor all night which is exactly what we wanted. We got married 5 months ago, and we still have friends and family telling us how great he was! He was also totally down for our personal touches: he announced our wedding party like a starting lineup, had everyone turn on their phone flashlights, helped us with an “MVP award ceremony”, and successfully coordinated a photo dash with all of our tables. He was THE BEST! We also loved our photobooth and so did the guests! We had the best day ever and would absolutely recommend booking BME!

Choosing All Generations Entertainment was one of the easiest and best decisions we made during our wedding planning. The booking process was clear, organized, and extremely professional from the start. Phil was fantastic to work with he made everything simple and straightforward, explained the process in detail, and stayed in constant communication leading up to the wedding. Knowing we were in good hands took a huge weight off our shoulders. Duane was our DJ and was exceptional and truly set the tone for the entire reception. He was attentive, polished, and knew exactly how to keep the night moving smoothly. He did an incredible job reading the crowd and adjusting the music to match the energy in the room.What stood out most was Duane's ability to balance professionalism with fun. He kept the celebration lively without ever being overbearing, and his timing and transitions were spot-on. We would absolutely recommend them to anyone looking for a smooth planning process and an amazing DJ who knows how to create the perfect atmosphere.

We met with him about a year prior to our wedding to go over our general plans and knew he was the perfect fit for us. A couple weeks before we met and went over the playlist and entrance songs, he is so great as a DJ we had no worries at all. Every song we requested he played and he kept the dance floor full all night. We cannot recommend him enough, he was fantastic! The music was loud enough for the party but also not so loud during dinner you couldn’t talk or hear, it was the perfect level.

I can't thank you enough for helping us at last week's CCI Graduation at the Hilton. Things went as smoothly as they could have gone, in part because of you making yourself available to assist us. I truly appreciate your willingness to help us make this very special event a big success. I look forward to working with you again at future events!

Sal and team were OUTSTANDING. I couldn't belive how smoothly things went, I was expecting to have to "Micro manage" everybody. But from our first talk, Sal said "don't worry, we gotcha" and they did from that point up until the evening was over, Best Music, Best MC, Wasn't too loud or too soft. lighting was perfect. I could go on and on. I wish there was a 6th star. we would have giving that to them

DJ Allen was a pleasure to work with, as was Tina! Both were very prompt in answering and made sure mine and my husbands wedding dj vision was created! DJ Allen has many, many years of experience and it showed through his talents! Our dance floor was filled the entire night from the second it opened! Thank you DJ Allen and DJ’s available! 10/10!

Barry was an amazing wedding DJ and a huge part of what made our day so special. He kept the dance floor packed all night with his music selection and ability to read the room. Him and the owner, Mike, were incredibly organized, professional, and easy to work with throughout the whole process. We highly recommend Elite Entertainment, and specifically Barry, to anyone looking for a DJ.
