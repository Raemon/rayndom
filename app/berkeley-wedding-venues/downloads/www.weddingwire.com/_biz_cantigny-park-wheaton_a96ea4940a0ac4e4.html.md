Amazing Venue!!

We hosted our wedding at Cantigny Park this past weekend and it was the most wonderful experience ever!   
  
The staff was professional, friendly and went above and beyond with their service on our wedding day. All of our guests could not stop raving about the food and service they received and how our ceremony in the Rose Garden was absolutely beautiful.   
  
Amanda and Phoebe are both so kind and made the planning process so seamless from the beginning!   
  
We cannot wait to visit Cantigny again to reminisce on our perfect day and highly recommend booking your wedding here!

Wedding at Cantigny

We hosted our son's (and daughter in law) Wedding at the Cantigny this past weekend. Our planning begin with the selection of Rose Garden for the ceremony and Le Jardin as the dining room with guidance from Amanda. She was very helpful right from the get go in Feb-Mar when we first selected this venue. While initially they were reluctant about a few things like selection of our food vendor etc., Amanda and other Cantigny folks were receptive to other ideas and quickly cleared any hurdles in the process.   
  
As the process progressed, Amanda and later Phoebe, helped in guiding us in various ceremony and dining related items. This included the layouts, weather related backups, allowing access to other vendors/decorators, dining tables/chairs and many other things.  
  
All in all we were impressed with their professionalism, throughness, and ability to solve any issues that arose during and upto the wedding weekend.

Best Day Ever!

Our reception at Cantigny was the best decision we ever made for our special day. From our first inquiry to the last dance, everything went perfectly! Amanda, our contact person, was such a joy to work with, and unbelievably helpful. All the staff that helped us leading up to and during our reception were also the most professional, accommodating, and kind people. We also had our rehearsal dinner in the Red Oak Room I, which was so perfect. This goes without saying, but the place is absolutely gorgeous. The Woodside Pavilion wowed our guests, and the food was also incredible. Because of them, we were able to enjoy our day.

Would not change a thing!

We had our wedding ceremony and reception here and couldn't be more happy! They are all wonderful people to work with and so helpful through the whole planning process. Jessica and Phoebe and the ceremony coordinator and reception leads were fantastic. The venue is beautiful and affordable! We got married on the East Lawn and had our reception on the golf side at the tent the Woodside Pavilion and it was the perfect day. They are very flexible with you on making your own wedding package to customize your costs. If I had it to do all over again, I would choose Cantigny! I highly recommend to any couple and to any bride!

Great Wedding and Reception Venue!

The entire wedding process at Cantigny was run very well. We hosted our ceremony at the Rose Garden and our reception at Le Jardin. Our ceremony had to be moved inside due to weather, but the staff was able to quickly adapt to the backup location and everyone had a great evening at Cantigny! Cantigny as a venue is absolutely gorgeous! The ceremony and reception coordinators were well organized and guided us through every step of the process! The kitchen staff, servers, bartenders, and team were all super nice, thoughtful, and helpful, making the day go by smoothly and stress free! Even when things didn't go exactly according to plan, Cantigny’s communication and adaptiveness was instrumental in making our wedding day perfect! We would recommend Cantigny to anyone looking to host an event or party!

Taylor is incredible!

My husband and I have visited Cantigny Park many times in our lives. During one of our first dates, we happened to see a wedding happening on-site and thought, 'That's Cool!' Not realizing we would be doing the same thing several years later.  
  
Since day one, Taylor at Cantigny Golf was WONDERFUL! She was so prepared with answers to all of our questions, helped inform details we would have never thought about, and was so kind and genuine in ensuring all our needs were met. She is a SUPERHUMAN as she juggled the most weddings this year while becoming a momma!  
  
Her attention to detail provided us and our guests with peace of mind and SUCH A GOOD TIME. It's been two weeks since our wedding and people still keep asking us if we plan on having another event with them in the future.  
  
Pamela, our server for the evening, was outstanding in attending to our needs and allowed us to have such a wonderful time with loved ones.  
  
Small note for future brides: I wish there was a little more time dedicated with the Ceremony Specialists/Day-of Coordinator at Cantigny Park. There really wasn't much communication until the week before and it felt like I had to keep reaching out to touch base. Our DJ was even shocked when Gina mentioned, 'I forgot your wedding was coming up' during a meeting (which I'm certain was not literal or malicious - It just wasn't something I wanted to hear three weeks before our wedding.)  
  
And shout out to the rest of the staff at the Red Oak Room and Cantigny Park for making the day so wonderful! Great FOOD and great SERVICE!  
  
We cannot wait to celebrate our anniversaries by strolling through the same garden for years to come.

A dream location!

Absolutely thrilled with our experience start to finish. A beautiful venue to start. The food and beverage team is easy to work with. Packages and pricing was fair for the excellent quality of it! We married in the rose garden and had our reception at the woodside pavilion-which are both stunning! All of our guests enjoyed themselves and said the kindest things about being happy to share our wedding day at Cantigny!

Have your wedding here! Great for indian weddings!

Cantigny will always have a special place in my heart! Having a wedding during COVID was NOT easy but Cantigny did everything in they could to make it perfect for my husband I. Great communication, reliable and excellent service. Chris Pieters went above and beyond to make sure our fine details, crazy requests, and last minute accommodations were met. He updated us every week, gave us suggestions on how to make events run smoother and also-helped save us some money. The staff there made us feel so special. We even had guests also commenting on how nice the servers/bartenders were. Indian weddings can be hectic and full of suprises, but the staff at Cantigny made sure everything ran perfectly. The garden/lake is absolutely stunning and our wedding photos came out gorgeous. It's been a year since our wedding and I still have people coming up to me about how gorgeous our wedding was--I owe all of that to Catingy, Chris and his staff! So glad we chose this place as our venue!

Beautiful venue. Several options for outdoor weddings. My favorite is the East Lawn. A long, tiered aisle to walk down. Their sound system is stellar -- all the guests can hear what's being said. (That's not true for all outdoor venues.) Highly recommended.
