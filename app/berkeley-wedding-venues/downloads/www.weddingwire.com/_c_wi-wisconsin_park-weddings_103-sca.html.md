We had the most amazing fall inspired wedding. The venue and outdoor areas were prefect and the wood pillars and sting lights were breathtaking. Mary Beth and Beatrice, were amazing. They answered every question and were so helpful the entire night.

The banquet staff at Blue Harbor are incredible! Throughout the whole planning process Annalise was there to answer any of my questions and help ensure the day was everything I wanted. She was knowledgable, direct, and accommodating. She understood my vision and helped bring it to life. Unfortunately she wasn't able to be there the day of the wedding which was a disappointment for us, but Erika stepped in. The event staff were constantly checking in on us and ensuring we had enough to eat and drink. The food was delicious! Everyone commented on the quality of the food. Once dinner was over it was cleaned up so quickly and ready for the dance party to begin. The staff was very attentive all night long. I couldn't have asked for a better venue to host my wedding. The beautiful floor to ceiling windows overlooking Lake Michigan made it so special. I would 100% recommend working with Annalise. She is the best!

Venue was great! Several different gardens to choose from and the whole area is beautiful. They were going through a staff change which hinder communication for a little bit, but once someone was hired, it was great and professional. We had our ceremony in the Gazebo garden and reception in the atrium. The bar is done through Rotary, and they are great and professional. Loved our wedding day and would highly recommend!

My spouse and I had the literal wedding of our dreams. The Gardens were able to accommodate things we wanted, like family style dinner, long tables, great sound quality and an incredibly beautiful outdoor space. Getting married here was easy, the whole team communicated so quickly and respectfully. Being a queer couple, it was great to be in a space we could be fully ourselves. I don't think either of us could have anticipated anything better. The food was delicious, the venue was gorgeous, the people were great and the day was perfect.

We had our wedding reception at Olbrich Gardens and it was wonderful! They were easy to work with and give you a list of the approved caterers. If you want to provide alcohol at your event, they only have one option that you have to use. They help set up and take down the tables and chairs. There was also a special event going on at the gardens the evening of our wedding and we were able to provide discounted tickets to our guests! Was a fabulous perk!

Here’s a polished version of your heartfelt review: Green Bay made our dreams come true! Out of everyone in our family, we were the only two who knew the surprise location of our reception. Our family had never been to Lambeau Field before—being from Chicago, they never found the time to visit—and seeing their faces light up as they stepped foot in this iconic place for the first time was truly special. Keeping it a secret for four years made the reveal even more magical, and having our whole Packer family there was the perfect touch for our celebration. Getting married on my dad’s birthday held deep meaning for me, especially since he’s no longer with us. I wanted to give my family the gift of celebrating at Lambeau Field, a place he always dreamed of visiting but never had the chance to see. I know he would have been overjoyed to experience this day with us. The Lambeau Field team went above and beyond to make our day unforgettable. Every member was incredibly kind and accommodating, and I am truly grateful for all their efforts. I will always recommend my favorite team to anyone looking to host an event. Thank you for making our day so special!
