## About

***2025 Dates still available for January-March! 2026 Dates available for booking starting Jan 1, 2025***

Green Mountain Retreat is a hidden gem of a wedding venue in the Silicon Valley, just a short drive from downtown Los Gatos, California. Nestled in the Santa Cruz Mountains, this location is ideal for out-of-town guests, just a 25-minute drive from San Jose Airport. Couples can tie the knot on 66 acres of majestic redwood and oak woodlands surrounded by their closest friends and family.

**Facilities and Capacity**

Depending on the chosen package from Green Mountain Retreat, several beautiful locations are on offer for a ceremony and reception. All three packages include the ceremony at the Amphitheater before departing for one of the designated venues. For smaller, intimate gatherings of no more than 100, the Courtyard or the Welcome Center are perfect destinations. Regarding more lavish affairs, couples can choose a reception on the Front Lawn following cocktail hour in the Lower Meadow. This location has a comfortable capacity of up to 250 guests. Alternatively, clients may wish to hold their cocktail reception in the Courtyard, freeing up the Performance Hall for a memorable evening of fine dining, dancing, and conversation. The Performance Hall can hold up to 200 people and, like all the other venues, is fully customizable to the wedding day color, themes, and vibe.

**Services Offered**

Several amenities and services are available at Green Mountain Retreat, including on-site accommodations for up to 150 guests. Depending on the scale of the celebration, couples can have their entire wedding party within walking distance. When that happens, Green Mountain Retreat becomes the exclusive property of the newlyweds and their nearest and dearest throughout their stay.
