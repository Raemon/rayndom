As the mother of the bride, I cannot express enough how incredible the experience was - from the staff, to the location, to the food - it was all perfect. I attribute the success of my daughter's wedding (8/23/25) to our Event Manager Amy K. Because of Amy's professionalism, responsiveness, and patience with my daily and endless questions, I knew that the evening would be handled without a hitch. Our family and friends are still raving about the wedding service and reception. The location is iconic. The wedding in the Martha-Mary Chapel will always be foremost in my mind's eye - the chapel itself is special and beautiful. As they exit the chapel with the view of the Village Green and surrounded by family and friends, the newlyweds ring the bell cast by Paul Revere's son. That is another lasting memory. If you have a smaller guest list, don't be put off by the word "Tavern" in using the Eagle Tavern. The Tavern is iconic; the historic feel of the Tavern is part of the experience, especially for a couple who love history. We've all been to endless receptions at banquet halls, but staying with the historic nature of Greenfield Village made the night seem like a step back to a time and place where the gathering of family and friends was the special part of the experience. So with a beautiful and historic wedding service and reception location, you will want to consider the quality of the food: in short, incredible. One table called the chef over to ask how the braised short ribs were cooked to such perfection. It is also a touch of whimsy to offer options of iconic Detroit desserts such as Faygo Floats, it was a way to show a little local pride. Typically, no one remembers the wedding food, but in this case the food has been mentioned over and over to us. But again, I must stress that the Event Manager (Amy K) was incredible all during the planning, and the Banquet Manager (Jamie) made the reception itself run perfectly. This is entirely a point to my specific personality, but Amy could understand my humor, such that I did not feel like I was working with a distant staff just doing their job, but rather someone who understood how I handle the stress. The most important aspect is that my daughter and new son-in-law have repeatedly thanked us for putting together a wedding that far exceeded their dreams. It wasn't a wedding that depended on table decorations, favors, or little signs we made for various tables (gifts, favors, etc.), it was the experience of the surroundings - meaning it was not what you bring to the wedding to decorate, it is pre-decorated with the historic nature of Greenfield Village itself.

Working with the entire events staff at the Detroit Zoo was a fantastic experience. We held a 120-person ceremony at the fountain, and it couldn't have been more perfect. We also rented a golf cart to make it easy to get around for photos, and we can't wait to see them. The staff was invaluable, accommodating, and had excellent communication, checking in with us beforehand to ensure everything was set. The fountain was set up with chairs perfectly, electrical outlets were available for our musician and PA, and the rooms we had in the Education Center were perfect for getting ready. We have both loved the Detroit Zoo since we were kids, and having our special day there was magical. Highly recommend it!

We had our reception at the museum and it went so smoothly and stress free! Everyone loved being able to go into the first floor and use the carousel . The staff there was willing to keep the entire bridal party on schedule, and take care of any foreseeable problems so we did not have to. 10/10 would recommend using this venue and would do it again and again!

We cannot speak more highly of Laura, who is the new event director!! She was a dream to work with for our Jan. 2023 wedding, with both the ceremony and reception at the Heritage Museum! She was very knowledgeable and helped us with every detail we needed. She made sure every box was checked and every i dotted with the details. Laura was amazing to communicate with and made sure to respond within a timely fashion, sometimes even on her day off! She helped give her input on what might work best for the space, which was super helpful! Laura went above and beyond to see if we were able to accommodate our dogs within our ceremony, which they were!! We cannot highly recommend working with Laura enough! 10 stars!! She was wonderful and would love to work with her again for any of our events in the future!

A hidden gem! We were planning an outdoor wedding, and the weather was far from cooperative. We booked the museum a month before our wedding. It was definitely meant to be! The staff was wonderful, kind, accommodating, and the space was amazing! It felt like we hosted an event, as opposed to a stuffy, banquet-hall wedding reception! I really, cannot say enough good things...a pleasure to work with!

Having my wedding at a local venue was something at the top of my list once I got engaged. With getting married in the winter there isn’t too many options where you can do the ceremony and reception all in one place and the Ramsdell provides just that! The whole day was honestly so magical. Having such a historic building in Manistee as an option for a wedding venue is priceless in my opinion. Laura was a tremendous help with planning, set up, and finalizing everything. I can’t express how thankful I am for her as she played a hand in making my wedding dreams come true. I would 100% recommend having the Ramsdell as a wedding venue to anyone who asks! I am thankful Manistee has the Ramsdell Theatre because I don’t see how my wedding could have been done the same!
