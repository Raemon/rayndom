Absolutely beautiful venue with an accommodating staff, Jenna is amazing! We reviewed over 20 venues, but the value, beauty, and what was included at the OMA couldn't be beat. We are still having people rave about the location.

Holly & her staff at the James Museum were incredible to work with. Everyone from our guests to the wedding party and even the other vendors were impressed with how great it looked. Be sure to tour and ask Holly about the meanings behind all of the incredible art surrounding your ceremony. It will absolutely be worth it!

The beauty of the Gardens exceeded our expectations and was by far the most magical experience for our special day. We held our ceremony in front of the banyan tree during sunset and I can't express how unreal the Gardens looked. There were butterflies fluttering all around, rays of sunlight passing through the palms, tiny bunches of orchids blooming, and brilliant varieties of green everywhere. Seriously ridiculous, the type of stuff Disney movies are inspired by. Our guests were in disbelief that such a magical place existed in the middle of Miami beach. The day wouldn't have come together without the guidance, hands on help and fresh spontaneous ideas of the garden Events & Programming Manager Maurice Jackson. This man is the absolute best!!!!! He doesn't miss a beat, and when you need that boost of confidence for a "crazy idea", he helps you make it real within reason. The Gardens were very clean and a perfect size for our 100 guests to roam around freely and safely while still being able to hear the music playing on the dance floor while also having multiple bars within reach scattered about the grounds. It's also beautifully lit at night so minimal lights are needed, leaving room for fun lighting decor. Lastly, we chose the premium liquor package and received zero complaints from guests. We would 10/10 recommend the Gardens for your event or wedding! Communication is stellar and they make your day all about you. We will cherish the Gardens through our pictures forever. One last bit of advice, if you're having a late night wedding, add the 40/100 clear tent in the great lawn to bring it all together. Guests were able to still enjoy the Gardens while eating dinner with no threats of rain to worry about. Love, The Gillettes

I did my baby shower here a few weeks ago and had such a smooth and amazing experience. Farrah helped me with planning and organizing the entire thing. She kept in good contact with me and was super supportive and easy to work with. I loved my experience here and I’d definitely come back and work with Farrah again!

We got married at the Lightner Museum in November 2025, it was so gorgeous and even prettier with the Night of Lights decor up! The team was incredibly responsive, super professional and made the day run very smoothly. We truly didn't have anything to worry about on the day of the wedding, which was such a relief! It's such a unique and beautiful venue, and all our guests were loving it. St. Augustine is also the perfect place to have a wedding with so many different accomodations within walking distance, tons to do around town, and so many restaurants and other venues available to do rehearsal dinners/welcome parties etc. The staff was super professional and responsive, and the whole day was so memorable. They do have some policies that you can't change (when we had access on the day of the wedding, as the museum was open, and the rehearsal timing etc, requirements for security etc), but they were all workable. They do require you to have a wedding coordinator, which was definitely worth it for us anyways, and you have otherwise full range on which vendors to choose for catering and it was great to be able to bring in different types of food! The bar staff were also awesome. Overall it is pricey, but it was absolutely worth it. We absolutely loved getting married there, and it was also a really memorable weekend for our guests, who were all from out of town!

The Old Davie School House is an absolute treasure for catering companies like ours (Miami Grill Catering). Nestled in the heart of Davie, this historic venue exudes charm and character that sets the stage for unforgettable weddings. From the moment we set foot on the grounds, we're greeted with nostalgia and rustic elegance that enhances the dining experience we create. The facilities are exceptional for caterers, with a well-equipped kitchen. The venue's staff is a dream to work with - they're responsive, accommodating, and dedicated to ensuring every event runs smoothly. The backdrop of the beautifully restored schoolhouse and lush gardens provides a picturesque setting for our culinary creations. We're always thrilled to be part of events at the Old Davie School House, and our clients consistently rave about the unique atmosphere it provides. If you're seeking a historic venue that combines charm, professionalism, and catering-friendly amenities, the Old Davie School House is a top-notch choice. Five stars, no question!

My husband and I made the decision to get married at the Orlando Science Center before we even got engaged! One of the first things we bonded over in our relationship, was a mutual appreciation and love of dinosaurs, and when we found out there was a place that dinosaurs could be the backdrop for our reception-we knew OSC was going to be our wedding venue. When my husband wanted to propose, he reached out Helen, Molly, and the team at the Science Center because he needed a theater, but he also thought it would be a fitting space since we wanted to get married there. The events team was totally on board and was so supportive and helpful every step of the way! When it came time to plan our wedding, everything fell into place super easily thanks to OSC. We attended a couple of the Unveil wedding expo events at OSC, which gave us the opportunity to interact with our vendors and to start to picture what our wedding day would look like. We found all our vendors through OSC, and every single one was truly the best. Communication with the events team at OSC was also amazing every step of the way. The team answered emails really quickly, but if there was ever a time they were unavailable, they left clear out of office emails with back up contact info and when they were expected to be back. I never felt silly asking my questions and always received professional answers. When it came time for our wedding, everything turned out perfectly! We had communication with our day of coordinator a few weeks before the wedding and we were able to answer each other's questions so that our vision could come to life. Our ceremony was held on the terrace, followed by cocktail hour in Our Planet, and reception in Dino Digs. It may sound cliche, but our wedding was absolutely perfect and our favorite day ever! My husband and I really enjoyed wedding planning every step of the way, and I am sure it's thanks to the amazing experience we had with the Orlando Science Center. There aren't enough good things that we can say about our experience. We are truly so grateful for everything the team did for us. OSC was the perfect venue for us, and I'm so glad we decided to have our wedding there! We would live our wedding day all over again-not because we need a re-do, but because we just had the best time! A major thank you to The Orlando Science Center-the best place to have a wedding!

We are so happy we had our ceremony at the Museum of Fine Arts! It is an absolutely gorgeous space with endless options for stunning photos. The staff were so kind and easy to work with and everything went off without a hitch. Our guests commented on how beautiful it was and many of them enjoyed exploring the galleries and eating at the cafe before the ceremony began. The space is also accessible, well air conditioned and allows you to get great natural light while staying out of the hot Florida sun. This helped us maintain a good guest experience, which was important to us. Thank you for helping our day feel so special, moving and fun!

Morikami Museum and Gardens was a perfect choice for our wedding ceremony. It was even more beautiful then we imagined. Alanna was amazing. She took the time to show us the locations available for our garden ceremony. Listening to our vision and sharing her expert knowledge of how to make it work. She was there very step of the way the day of the ceremony. It was like having your best friend making sure your wedding ceremony was perfect. All of the staff was so friendly, supportive and helpful in making our day run smooth. We highly recommend and couldn't imagine our wedding ceremony anywhere else.

We loved using Mote as a venue! We did both the ceremony and reception in the New Pass Room. Our guests loved being able to have a drink and take pictures on the balcony. Such a perfect venue if you want to have a beachy feel but still be indoors during the hot summer months. We were able to divide the rooms for the ceremony and then open up the dividers for dinner and the dance floor
