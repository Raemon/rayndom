We hired The Deoc Ensemble to play during our outdoor wedding cocktail hour, and they exceeded every expectation. Their performance brought the perfect energy to our celebration. They offered a fantastic variety of upbeat songs, and I especially appreciated how they incorporated some of my favorite Taylor Swift pieces at my request. Hearing those familiar melodies arranged for strings was such a special touch, and our guests absolutely loved it. We booked The Deoc Ensemble very last minute and Grace was incredible to work with and pulled together a trio so effortlessly on short notice. The group was professional, easy to work with, and incredibly talented. Their music added so much warmth and personality to the cocktail hour, and I can’t imagine our wedding day without them. I wholeheartedly recommend The Deoc Ensemble to anyone looking to elevate their wedding or special event. They helped make our day unforgettable!

Tiny was fantastic! I had no clue how to go about getting our music ready for our wedding. He walked my fiance and I through the planning stages, gave us ideas for special songs--and pointed out places that music might be helpful, like the cake cutting--that we hadn't even thought about! We changed our first dance song three times, and he didn't even blink. And the day of our wedding, he was even better! He set up the night before, and had music going even before our first guests arrived. We were delayed with the photographer, and he helped us rework our reception schedule to get all of our special events in, and did a fabulous job keeping everyone entertained all night! I couldn't ask for more help before our wedding day, or more flexibility and help on our big day! Thanks, Tiny!

Getting married in the Basilica is a one of a kind experience. It is truly an unbeatable venue. The ceremony musicians are wonderful as well. We had Daniel Bayless and Danielle Svonavec and they were wonderful. If you want a beautiful and traditional venue this is definitely the place for that! It was especially special for me and my fiancé because our first date was mass there followed by brunch and he then proposed there as well :)

We absolutely loved Megan's performance at our wedding. She took all of our song suggestions and played them beautifully, setting the atmosphere to every moment of our ceremony. Since day one, she has been very professional and flexible with our consultations. She was very friendly and easy to communicate with. The one thing we loved the most about Megan (aside from her performance) was her willingness to learn any songs that we suggested. We're very happy that we chose Mystical Harp to play for our ceremony!

Charis coordinated and participated in providing the music for before and directly after the ceremony of our son and daughter-in-law's wedding, and we couldn't have been more pleased! The music was beautiful and exactly the style we had dreamed of. The communications were direct and timely, options were offered when we had little to offer, and the group was accommodating on every request. Love love love what was done to make our beautiful day complete.

Jan's professionalism, talent, and personality are all AMAZING. She helped to make our special day feel like a fairy tale. Her broad repertoire of classical, jazz, and even R&B set a tone that was both modern and classy. She also makes sure to meet with you before your big day to select your program and play samples. I can't praise her enough! The caliber of her talent is unmatched by many! Jan has toured in Europe, performed at the Palladium, and has celebrity clientele, but she treats everyone like royalty and is incredibly humble. As a musician, businesswoman, and individual Jan is superb!

Cathy did a wonderful job not only coordinating, but playing the ceremony music for our wedding. Except for a couple of songs, I really didn't know what music I wanted for our ceremony. I spoke with Cathy about the style of our wedding, and she had fantastic suggestions, including "Kiss The Girl" for the recessional, which I never would have thought of, but it fit perfectly! Cathy and the other two musicians did a lovely job at the ceremony. I can't thank them enough!
