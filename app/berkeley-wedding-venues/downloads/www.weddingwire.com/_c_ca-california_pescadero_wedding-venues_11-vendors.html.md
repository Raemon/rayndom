VRC helped accommodate us and our entire family when our original reception venue cancelled due to wildfires (we were married in September 2020)! We ended up doing an informal wedding ceremony and reception here. They were super flexible and obliging even though our very large group scheduled with them very last minute. We used all of the grounds (stayed the night before our wedding and the night after) and it was so beautiful! The venue is surrounded by nature - some woods and very close to the beach - but still had the comforts of a very spacious kitchen/dining, bathrooms, etc. The only issue we ran into was that there was no cell service - but we wanted an unplugged ceremony anyway. :)

Words really can't describe just how highly we recommend Green Oaks Creek Farm. We had an unforgettable time planning and hosting our wedding at this magical place. If you have the opportunity to host an event at this venue, you will surely walk away, as we did after our wedding, in complete awe of the property, owners & staff, and experience overall. The owners, Stephanie and Paul, are extremely responsive and accommodating, and invited us to visit GOCF whenever we needed leading up to our wedding to coordinate with other vendors. They were so pleasant to work with from the moment we first emailed to the moment we hugged goodbye! The space: The property is breathtaking, with several different terraces that have their own unique spaces and vibes. From the upper terrace where we held our ceremony, you can look over the pacific ocean while shaded by tall eucalyptus trees. In the garden, you can relax on the grass and meander through the lovingly curated garden beds. A short stroll bordered by garden beds (which were bursting with dahlias at the time of our wedding in October) and you'll arrive at the reception area which is open, well-manicured, and also gives priceless views of the ocean, the surrounding meadows, and flower beds. GOCF also offers rental of numerous dwellings on the property. We took advantage of a package that included all three rentals for 2 nights. They were very clean, stylish, and stocked with everything you may need for a special weekend. Other awesome GOCF offerings: The owners clearly love and meticulously care for the land here. In the garden and in the reception area there are very large (and very stunning) live-edge bar tables made from reclaimed wood from the property. The reception area also has many smaller live-edge reclaimed wood cocktail tables. The hosts also provided as many wood benches as we needed for the ceremony space. It was awesome that we didn't need to rent seating for the ceremony space! The reception area also has a beautiful stone dance floor, an awesome fire pit which Stephanie and Paul provided wood for AND lit for us both the night before and night of our wedding. Edison string lights are hung all throughout the reception area and the walkways throughout the property are well lit. There is also a kitchen space in the reception area that was easily accessible to our caterers and was available for us to use the night before our wedding to host our rehearsal dinner. Being a working flower farm, we also highly recommend purchasing flowers directly from the farm! It was so cool to have flowers in our bouquets and vases that had been picked just steps away. Their prices are very reasonable and they had a fantastic variety. GOCF provided for us our dream quintessential coastal California wedding. Go check it out and you’ll see why it’s so, so uniquely special.

My husband and I couldn't have dreamed of a more perfect wedding. Susan, Karter, and Chef Henry helped make our wedding a success! Our friends and family are still raving about our big day - the delicious food by Chef Henry for our reception and brunch the following morning, ocean and mountains views, and how seamless the coordination was. The event director and coordinator, Susan and Karter, made planning our day so easy. They were extremely helpful, responsive, and receptive to our requests. We look forward to celebrating our anniversaries here every year and visiting the team!

We got married here in May of this year and could not be happier with how it went. We were not looking for a wedding in a box and SlowCoast was the opposite of that. All of the people we worked with were so accommodating and genuinely kind, which is a rarity in the wedding industrial complex. It is a lot of work to design almost all aspects of your celebration. But if that's ultimately what you want then you won't find the ability to customize things so much as we did with SlowCoast. Thank you all so much, the whole weekend at SlowCoast was just magical.

My husband and I got married at the Pie Ranch back in 2022, and it was such a beautiful experience that I've been meaning to write a review ever since. The event coordinator at Pie Ranch did an amazing job responding to our questions and advising on finding local vendors. Their recommended chef was outstanding. The highlights include a ceremony site overlooking fields and the ocean, a meadow for dining, and a barn for dancing. There is also a delightful, twinkle-lit space in front of the barn with optional heaters, which meant that those who had mobility issues or concerns about COVID could have a wonderful time without having to step inside.
