It was the most unique and picturesque wedding we could ask for. Numerous people told us it was stunning and the best wedding they've ever attended. Having nature embedded into the service was perfect for us. Highly recommend! We were very pleased working with Janet and especially Noelle.

Brooke at Legacy Ranch made our entire wedding planning experience so easy and enjoyable! She thought of every little detail, many things I hadn’t even considered, and guided us through the process with such kindness and professionalism. On the day of our wedding, she made everything completely stress-free, handling each detail seamlessly so we could just relax and soak in the moment. The venue itself was absolutely beautiful and the perfect location for our special day. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience,highly recommend Brooke and Legacy Ranch!

There is not one negative thing you can say about this venue. Granted, we haven't even hosted our wedding yet, but I have never felt nervous or worried or taken advantage of in our entire planning process. We are a couple who has had to reschedule our wedding due to COVID-19. Chelsea at Los Poblanos helped us to find new available dates with rooms available for our guests. There was no change in price, no hassle, and no complaints. I cannot express enough how sweet and generous they are with their time. I am constantly thinking of new questions or suggestions and Chelsea is always there to help me out in a timely fashion. They do not nickle and dime you for everything like some places do, even offering a board to display our seating chart, a letter box for cards, and tons of great decor and logistic suggestions. As someone who has had a particularly difficult planning process (this is a destination wedding for us and we have been hit with a pandemic 1.5 months before our wedding), it has been a dream knowing they are taking care of so much. They also have the best vendors who they work with constantly, and they have also been great to work with. It is no wonder this place books up fast because it is truly gorgeous, unique, high quality, and worth every penny. Thank you LP, we love you!

We wanted to have an outdoor wedding and an outdoor reception at the same location. There weren't many places in Albuquerque that really fit the vision we had (we didn't want it to be at a country club or hotel), until we visited Old Town Farm and saw those huge cottonwoods! We discussed our idea with Mikaela Dunn, the event coordinator, who was eager to accommodate us and make our dream wedding happen. And WOW, did she deliver. Do not underestimate Mikaela's abilities! She is organized, responsive, creative, patient, calm, a problem solver, and has great taste. We relied heavily on her to pull things off the day of our wedding and she was the rockstar we needed to coordinate with the caterer, the DJ, the bartenders, the rental company, security, etc. She and her team helped move a million chairs and tables, decorate, set up and breakdown, and coordinated with us on dropping things off and picking things up. The space itself was gorgeous for our August wedding. We used the grassy yard for our ceremony space (and used the chairs that were included with the venue), used the space under the cottonwoods for our reception and outdoor dinner (and used the tables that were included with the venue, but rented padded wood chairs for dinner), and used the barn for dancing. We got lucky that a monsoon didn't roll through in the evening, as we took a risk and didn't set up a tent outside for dinner- but the way everything looked under the trees was exactly what we wanted. Mikaela got the vision and executed it perfectly, even helping us string up white bunting along the outdoor string lights. We initially were hesitant about the cost of the venue, but the value is especially realized by the amount of work that was done by Mikaela, her husband Ethan, and team. To top it all off, Mikaela and Ethan are such kind people. We are so happy that we got married at Old Town Farm and that they were open to our idea of having our reception dinner outside, even though it created so much additional work for them.

Truly the best day we could have asked for. From the beginning Log River Ranch was spectacular with communication and helped recommend things that had worked in the past. Karlee was always open to trying to new things and adding a special touch to our day. It was absolutely beautiful and I wouldn’t have changed a thing! We felt very well taken care of and it was worth our money 100%!

The entire staff at the FJR is absolutely wonderful. Every one of them are kind people that are willing to work with whatever you need. The couple in charge of weddings, Micky and Emily, are wonderful hosts that are as flexible as they are helpful. My wife and I could not have asked for better people to work with. We highly recommend this place for your consideration.

Taos Goji farm was a magical place to celebrate our wedding. For our wedding ceremony, we chose the apple grove with a view of the mountains. The rustic barn was perfect for our reception. and our reception and dance party. We loved that our closest friends and family could stay at the farm in their cabins and tipis. Some also camped on the farm. The goji staff was super friendly and helpful. The farm animals were unique and a real bonus. We will return to this unique farm for our anniversary.
