If you’re looking for a wedding venue that combines timeless elegance, impeccable service, and a touch of San Francisco magic, look no further than the Palace Hotel. Nestled in the heart of downtown San Francisco, this historic gem offers a truly unforgettable experience for couples and their guests. From the moment we arrived, we truly felt like royalty. The Palace Hotel’s opulent surroundings took our breath away. The Sunset Court, with its panoramic glass ceiling, provided a stunning backdrop for our ceremony. As I walked down the sequin aisle toward my partner, I felt like a character in a fairy tale. The crimson-red flowers in the Ralston Ballroom added a touch of romance, and the entire ambiance was nothing short of enchanting. Jennifer Mitchell, our dedicated wedding specialist, was an absolute gem. Her meticulous planning and warm demeanor put us at ease throughout the entire process. She listened to our vision, offered creative ideas, and ensured that every detail was flawlessly executed. Jennifer’s commitment to excellence made our wedding day stress-free and magical. To the entire Palace Hotel team, thank you for making our dream wedding a reality. Your dedication, professionalism, and warmth touched our hearts. We’ll forever treasure the memories created within your historic walls.

Working with Tracey put me at ease. Her experience and professionalism were beyond my expectations! She literally was able to "predict the future" and help us make informed decisions that spared us stress and heartache on our wedding day and general planning. Her response time to emails and phone calls I wish people would take a lesson from her on that. It was flawless which made her so accountable and trustworthy. This is what every couple needs in a very fun yet, stressful time in their lives. Tracey is an asset to this venue.

If I had do it all over again, I would do it exactly the same! It was a dream come true to have our wedding reception at Fort Mason and I'm so thankful to have had Shawn and the whole team at Fort Mason to assist with our wedding day. The venue is beautiful and all of our guests were stunned by the view and location.

We couldn't be happier having our wedding at the University Club in April 2023. The moment we met Yvonne we knew that the University Club was the right venue for us. She is so friendly, knowledgeable and relatable. We knew that she was going to make our wedding wonderful with as little stress to us! Yvonne handled everything with ease and worked so well with our other vendors so our wedding day went flawlessly. Everyone at the University Club is so friendly and accommodating. The head bartender met with me the day before the wedding to make sure everything was perfect and she made sure I had a drink in my hand all night. The front desk staff are so helpful and made our guests feel welcome all weekend. Our guests still talk about the delicious food they had. The appetizers are amazing and the prime rib/salmon station was a huge hit. My personal favorite was the mushroom ravioli, we want to come back just for that ravioli! Everything is made onsite so the food is hot and timed perfectly with the evening. Being a more all inclusive site saved us so much hassle, not needing to worry about rentals and additional vendors showing up on time. Knowing they've done this so many times saved so much anxiety! For being an upscale venue in the heart of San Francisco, they are a very reasonably priced wedding venue, with no hidden fees at the end! Pick the University Club and dazzle your guests with delicious food and stunning views of San Francisco!

The people working at the catering and events department are great! They are responsive, patient and very helpful in addressing all my questions/concerns. I planned my own wedding and they made my experience much easier since the venue took care of things such as catering, beverages, set-up, and some rentals. I must say that everyone I had the pleasure of dealing with were polite, helpful, and took their jobs seriously which made the experience as stress free as possible. The chef went out of his way to handle the dietary restrictions of my guests and the food was great. Good sized servings and tasty. The staff who worked my event were also friendly and accommodating. I received very positive feedback from my guests regarding the food, the atmosphere and the staff. Honestly, if I had to do it all over again, I'd still pick the same venue. I had a great wedding and I think that was largely because I chose the Hyatt Centric and worked with their wonderful staff.

I cannot express enough how absolutely thrilled I am with our wedding venue choice. From the moment we stepped foot onto the grounds, I knew it was the place I always envisioned. It has always been my dream to have a ceremony with a breathtaking view, and this venue delivered on every level. The highlight of our wedding day was undoubtedly the stunning sunset that adorned the horizon as we exchanged our vows. It felt like a fairytale come true, and I am forever grateful to the team for making that moment possible. Their attention to detail and dedication to ensuring every aspect of our day was perfect truly made us feel like VIPs. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our needs and preferences. From the initial planning stages to the day of the event, they were professional, friendly, and attentive. They listened to our vision and executed it flawlessly, making the entire planning process a breeze. I cannot recommend this wedding venue enough. It truly exceeded all of our expectations and made our dream wedding a reality. If you are searching for a venue that will take your breath away, provide top-notch service, and make you feel like a VIP, look no further. Trust me, it is worth every penny.

We cannot recommend Emily and Janciz at City Club enough! They truly were the dream team that made our wedding experience completely stress-free and enjoyable, both during the planning process and on the big day. From our very first consultation, they were incredibly organized, proactive, and responsive. Planning a wedding can be overwhelming, but Emily and Janciz were always ten steps ahead, ensuring every detail was covered well in advance. Their level of professionalism and expertise was immediately apparent. We had to go back and forth on the Banquet Event Order many times because some things we thought would be fun to add (lamb shanks, french fry station, etc.) ended up compounding in price with surcharges and taxes. But, they were very willing to help us with our requests. They made us feel completely supported and heard throughout the entire journey. On the day of the wedding, everything ran flawlessly. They were constantly on top of every detail, allowing us to relax and fully immerse ourselves in the celebration. City Club is a beautiful venue, but Emily and Janciz are the incredible people who truly bring the experience to life. If you are considering City Club, you are in the best hands possible with Janciz!

We could not have been more excited to have our wedding at the MMC in San Francisco for our October 2016 nuptials. Lisa Jimenez was so attentive to all of our questions and any concerns that we had along our almost 1.5 year process. She made sure we had all we needed for our special day. The bridal suite was amazingly wonderful. Plenty of room for my bridesmaids to get ready. We had 2 hairdressers and 2 makeup artist, 2 photographers and a videographer in the room and we had plenty of room. We had our ceremony and reception on the 11th floor in the Crystal Ballroom. Our ceremony was beautiful. We transformed the ballroom with curtains and floral arrangements to block the back and front walls. The help we received with all of our plans was amazing. We selected an open bar with passed hors d'oeuvres. From the buffet set up, we asked for the antipasto and cheese trays to be placed in the cocktail bar for our guests to enjoy before dinner. Our guests tell us the food was great, we didn't get to try much of it as we were chatting with guests and taking pictures. We took our main set of pictures in the beautiful library post ceremony; totally recommend at least a few pictures there. Simone, our day of coordinator was great. She made sure everything ran smoothly throughout the day, even fluffing my dress one last time before I walked down the aisle. We set up a charging station for our guests and the MMC set up a sign with their Wi-Fi. What a nice touch...our youngest guests were excited to have Wi-Fi available throughout the night. Our wedding ended early the next morning and were welcomed to our suite with a bottle of sparkling wine, cake and a set of beautiful MMC flutes (which we accidently left in the room). We had the wedding of our dreams and can't thank the MMC staff enough for all they did! Lisa you are the best!

We hosted our wedding at the Presidio Officers' Club and had truly the most special, incredible day of our lives. It was clean, well-organized, with delicious food and friendly staff. Not to mention, the planning team at the Presidio, through Wedgewood Weddings, was truly best-in-class. Wedgewood prepared us so well, providing a planning binder and step-by-step instructions. They checked in with us multiple times: providing walk-throughs, and answering every question extremely promptly. We especially loved our planner and day-of coordinator, Christian, who went out of his way to make everything so seamless. Christian taught us how to do our ceremony, including little details such as hand placement, went out of his way to accommodate a creative painting engagement, and provided private time for us newlyweds. He was perfect! So grateful to this beautiful venue and our wonderful team. We will treasure our experience with Wedgewood forever.
