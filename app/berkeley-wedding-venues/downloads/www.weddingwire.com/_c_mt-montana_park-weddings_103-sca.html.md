I can’t even begin to describe how perfect this venue was! From the views, to the facilities, to the staff. We opted to have Elsa be our “day of” coordinator but she was so much more! She worked with us in the months leading up to the wedding and helped out so much. The day went so smoothly thanks to her! All the Wildwood rentals she helped choose and setup for us looked beautiful, and added to the space and decor. I didn’t have a bridal party to put to work, but Elsa handled everything I could’ve needed. As I was about to walk out to the meadow my veil came off, and Elsa quickly helped me reattach it—and crisis averted. I’m sure she handled so many other things behind the scenes that I wasn’t even aware of, and I’m so thankful for that! Everyone says there’s going to be something “wrong” happen on the wedding day but as far as I’m aware it was perfect—exactly as I could have imagined. Elsa worked so well with all of our vendors, and helped guide family and friends throughout the day so everyone knew what they had to do and where to go. She had so many lovely ideas that I wouldn’t have thought of. And she truly made our wedding vision come to life. It is a well oiled machine at the Woodlands. We and all of our guests are from the Chicagoland area—this was a destination wedding for us, so it was extra helpful to have someone on site who knew what to do. But even if you live closeby, have a bridal party, or are super organized, I would still highly recommend to have Elsa coordinate. She has a calm and collected demeanor, which helped any nerves I had and made me feel confident everything was handled. She made sure me and Eddie had lots of moments to ourselves so that we could soak up the day together and breathe. Our wedding truly was the best day of our lives, and we couldn’t be more thankful to Elsa and the Woodlands team for making our dream day happen!

We were married at Paddle Ridge (Glacier Raft Company) in August 2024 and could not be happier that we chose this venue. We looked at TONS of spaces (virtually, since we live in Chicago) and chose this space for a few reasons: Location- located just minutes from the West entrance to Glacier National Park, the views were stunning, and we had tons of options for photo spots. Views- the view from the ceremony space (and the entire reception) was literal perfection. The photos say it all, but it felt like living in a post card. Our guest were blown away, and everyone has new profile pictures with this backdrop! The space- the venue itself is pretty simple, but very well maintained. They were watering, mowing, and trimming the afternoon before- it was PERFECT for our ceremony! We even had a little rain during dinner, and the rainplan for the space works perfectly. The cabins are also STUNNING. We stayed in the Ridgetop Retreat, which felt like having a resort lodge to ourselves for us and our wedding party to get ready in. It also served as storage and prep for the catering staff, space for our after party, and a lovely home base the day-of, conveniently located STEPS from the reception/ceremony space. We did not have a chance to see the Ridgetop Retreat (or any other cabins) when we visited a year prior, or virtually, so we were really just crossing our fingers that they were nice. Luckily they exceeded our expectations, but this venue definitely needs updated photos of the lovely interiors! If we had any feedback, it would be that dealing with reservations and pre-wedding communication was a bit of a pain. The service was subpar, and because the venue company and the parent company that handles lodging are seperately managed, nobody could tell us if/when we could get checked in early for our rehearsal (the day before our wedding), if anything could be unlocked to drop stuff off, or even if anyone was staying there that week, when we wanted to add time to our reservation. Also, no late checkout the day after a wedding is BRUTAL when you still plan to clean up after yourselves. While the venue's employees are incredibly kind, there was a lot of turnover during our time working with them and a lack of attention to detail because of that (we had to repeat ourselves and correct mistake frequently). Luckily we had a great planner to follow up for us during the wedding planning time, and everyone on-site was absolutely AMAZING during the weekend itself, especially the site manager and bartenders.

Our daughter was married at the lodge in March 2023, and Monica went above and beyond to make it a special weekend. She was very accommodating before the event so we could check out the cabins and lodge and plan for the big day. While we were in the midst of the craziness of decoration and preparing, she was available and very helpful. Sugarloaf Lodge and Cabins has a beautiful location, no matter what season! Staying at the location the night before and after the event was also very fun for the wedding party and immediate family. The skiing across the street was wonderful. We didn't feel any pressure to finish cleaning up at night when we were exhausted. We had plenty of time and could be present through the entire reception. Highly recommend Sugarloaf Lodge as a perfect spot for a beautiful off the grid wedding!

Finding a venue in Montana, let alone the Bozeman area, can be very expensive. Bridger Bowl was exceptionally well priced and was absolutely stunning. When we started looking for venues, we messaged with Jimbo, the food and vendor manager, and he was kind enough to take us up to the Deer Park Chalet via snowmobile as it was still ski season. He gave us a full tour and described in detail what the services they offered over the wedding day. We were able to use Bridger on Friday evening to host a rehearsal dinner for our close family and friends. The kitchen staff was kind enough to let us use their kitchen for prep for this. On wedding day, Bridger requires you use their food, beer and wine. This saved us the hassle of coordinating another vendor. We pre-ordered a few different types of beer and cider. We also selected a couple of appetizers and different entrees for our guests. After that, Bridger's staff mostly took care of everything for us. They got the tables and chairs set up for decorating on Friday. On wedding day, they made sure all of the facilities were well cleaned, were very effective on clearing plates and helping guests to beverages. They also tidied all of our decorations to one table at the end of the night for speedy clean up. We heard so many complements of the quality of the food and friendliness of the staff. Honestly it was some of the best food we've had at a wedding. Bridger really made our day go off without a hitch, and I'm so thankful we chose them for our wedding. Fond memories for years to come!!

We had a very small wedding with a quick turnaround time of a week and a half. From the start, Clint and Suri were very accommodating, kind, flexible, and thorough. They truly went above and beyond. I cannot thank them enough for their expertise from the planning to the rehearsal to our wedding day. The arch arrangement for the ceremony was beautiful. You can tell they both really care about making our wedding day special. Thank you.

It was exactly what I was looking for. Some communication break down but once we figured it out it went perfectly. Such a great experience and what a wonderful time we had on our special night.
