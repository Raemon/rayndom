Angela did amazing & whimsical calligraphy on our inner and outer envelopes for our wedding. She was less than it was going to cost to have them printed and her writing was charming & unique. Even the drive to Lexington was no big deal, because she had flexibility on when I could come drop them off and pick them up. That ended up late at night and then picked them up on a weekend. She had them done in no time and they were PERFECT!

Erin is a true calligraphy ARTIST! From the very first contact, she was friendly and responsive. She had my invitations done within several days, I was amazed at the speed in which she can make such beautiful lettering! She even threw in a customized return address stamp with my new married name on it, I was so giddy! I can't recommend her work enough. I've had several guests say they kept their invitation envelope because the calligraphy was so beautiful, they just couldn't throw it away! Definitely worth contacting her for a quick, unique and ultra classy upgrade to your wedding invites!

I ordered my wedding invitations from Etcetera this May. The woman spent about 45 minutes with me analyzing everything to make sure I had a perfect invitation. Within days, I had a proof from the company. Everything came in quickly and my invitations are classic and just everything I wanted.

WOW! Brynn owns and designs these invitations specific to each brides vision. You meet in her home at her dining room table, you touch and feel paper samples and then she makes it happen. I thought her prices would be too expensve but she was actually less than online companies and considerable less than any books we looked at. I can't tell you how many compliments we have received on the invitations. She also created a special "initial" for the RSVP cards and we ordered an embossing stamp to add that special touch to the bar and dessert napkins. I can't say enough good things about this vendor.

Hannah is an amazingly talented graphic designer that applies her skills toward wedding calligraphy. We had her craft our table menus, bar signage, and acrylic welcome sign, escort chart, and vow frame. Not only is her writing and design beautiful, but she works with printers who use high-quality materials, too. Our favorite pieces from her were our "Trust me, you can dance. -Bourbon" bar sign and our large floating acrylic picture frame she calligraphed our vows onto for display at our reception. That's something we'll keep in our home long after our wedding. Thanks again, Hannah!
