The Historic is a beautiful event center! The best people to work with, hands down. It’s wonderful to see this historic hotel building restored beautifully and available for the community to use for small events. Highly recommend!

I love The Eastern! What sets this beautiful space apart is definitely its versatility. Whether you’re planning a wedding, corporate event, or private party, the space can easily accommodate a range of occasions. The layout is open and spacious, allowing for a customizable experience, while the surrounding area of Eastern Market adds a dynamic energy to the setting.

Stonegate Manor is a beautiful place to get married and the owner, Alison, did everything she could to make it the wedding of my dreams! My wedding day flowed seamlessly with her coordination and you could just see all the love and effort she put into the venue and my wedding. I can’t recommend this venue enough!!

We had our wedding at the Masonic Temple in October of 2025 and we couldn't have been happier! The staff is SO attentive and helpful throughout the entire process. Throughout our wedding night and after I had multiple people come up to me and share how nice all the staff was and how delicious the food was. We had our ceremony in the chapel and our reception in the crystal ballroom. The chapel is amazing on it's own and really doesn't require many decorations. The ballroom is so ornate and when filled with our floral decorations, was absolutely stunning. If you are interested in this venue I would recommend setting an appointment to go look at it because the pictures really don't do it justice. As an added bonus for planning a wedding there, all the vendors have already worked there many times, which really make planning so much easier for you! I would 100% recommend booking the Masonic Temple for your wedding day, you won't be disappointed!

EVERYONE HERE IS WONDERFUL!! Ashley was our lead coordinator, and she was so responsive to us and our questions. The chefs, the bell hops (Moe was wonderful), the front desk staff, the vaquero captain Sherri, Josh in the kitchen, everyone wand just sensational. The food was incredible as well! Our rehearsal dinner and our wedding were magical and the Henry was responsive to every single need. I can't wait to spend time there in the future reliving those moments.

The crofoot venue is absolutely beautiful as well as having an amazing staff. Kristine was our wedding coordinator and she made sure everything went smoothly and really helped with any anxiety and also amazing with children. The entire crofoot staff is top notch I can't thank them all enough for making our special day absolutely amazing

In short: we couldn't have asked for a better venue for our wedding. We worked with Taliah to plan and prepare our wedding there, and the process was incredibly smooth, detailed, and organized. She left no stone unturned and helped us make decisions on things we never would have thought about - there are so many things, both large and little, that make for a great wedding, and it was clear on our day that they were ready for all of them. Every single person we interacted with at every level of staff was very kind, thoughtful, and attentive. Our guests remarked on how amazing the venue is; pictures barely do it justice. We feel very fortunate to have had our wedding at the Gem, it was everything we could've wanted and more for our special day.
