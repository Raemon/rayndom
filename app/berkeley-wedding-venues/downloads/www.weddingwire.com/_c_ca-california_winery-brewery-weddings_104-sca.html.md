An absolute fairytale of a wedding. Everything we could’ve hoped for and more. The venue looked absolutely beautiful, the weather was perfect and all the staff went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. It was truly the perfect day and I wish I could do it over again and again and again!

Ann, Dom, and the whole team at Wente made our wedding day an absolute dream come true! The food was spectacular (which is surprisingly rare at weddings!!) They even went out of their way to accommodate special diets and allergies!! The venue was just stunning! Truly, the photos don’t do it justice! Dom (or event coordinator) had everything running like a well-oiled machine! It was just a picture perfect day! I would recommend Wente for any and all events, big and small! We absolutely loved it! Enough so that we went to their sister site Murrieta’s Well the next day for some wine tasting with close friends and wedding guests! Top notch hospitality all around!

We had our wedding of 165 people here in October. And it was absolutely stunning! I would recommend this to anyone looking to get married in the area. The bridal suite was gorgeous and there was also a place for the groom to get ready. Kristin was very communicative throughout the planning process and lightened the stress load off my shoulders. Hope was the best day of coordinator and I would have my wedding here again in a heartbeat! Along with the professional team that helped out the day of. Many compliments from our guests as well.

We had our dream wedding at Callaway Vineyard & Winery on April 12, and we cannot say enough good things about the entire experience! From the very beginning, we worked with Jenn, who helped us get everything started, and then Mariah, who guided us through the rest of the planning. Both were incredibly responsive, organized, and thoughtful, and the whole team was so helpful and accommodating every step of the way. A huge shoutout to our two fantastic bartenders, especially Laura—our guests could not stop raving about how wonderful and sweet she was! The service across the board was impeccable. The venue itself is absolutely picturesque. We toured over 10 venues in the Temecula area, and Callaway truly stood out for its beauty, flexibility, and the sense of ease we felt working with their team. We reached out to them in a bit of a pinch after running into issues with our previous venue in San Diego, and with just six months left to plan, Callaway welcomed us and made everything happen seamlessly. We had our ceremony and cocktail hour outdoors with stunning views, and then moved inside to the breathtaking barrel room for our reception. Beyond the full wine and bar options, there were so many thoughtful touches and special add-ons we were able to include. One huge perk: tables, chairs, and other essentials were included with the venue fee, saving us time and stress with outside rentals. It was also incredibly convenient to have two getting-ready rooms onsite for us and our wedding parties, which made the day run so smoothly. As an LGBTQ+ couple, we also want to highlight how much we appreciated the Callaway team going above and beyond to make us feel included and ensuring our guests felt welcomed and celebrated. It’s a magical venue with an incredible team, and we feel so lucky that we were able to celebrate our wedding here. If you're considering Callaway, do not hesitate!

Viansa was amazing!! It's so perfect for a wedding from start to finish. It's the only winery in the area with such amazing hillside views, which was perfect for cocktail hour. The staff were incredibly friendly and went above and beyond to make our day perfect. We could not have asked for more!

It was such a lovely experience at Bernardo Winery and working with Terry. She was very patient and kind with us and answered all our questions. We had a very small wedding and intimate setting, and they worked with our budget. It was a perfect setting and night for our wedding. The staff was all so wonderful and accomodating as well. I couldn’t be happier!

We cannot put into words how magical our wedding day at V. Sattui Winery was—it truly exceeded every expectation. From the moment we stepped onto the property, we knew this was the place. The combination of the romantic stone architecture, the lush vineyards, and the warm, golden Napa light created the most breathtaking backdrop we could have imagined. The V. Sattui events team was nothing short of incredible. They were organized, attentive, and genuinely invested in making our day seamless and unforgettable. Every detail was handled with care, from the timeline coordination to the impeccable wine pairings. Our guests are still raving about the food and, of course, the wine. The culinary team delivered a meal that was elegant yet comforting—exactly what we wanted. And having award-winning wines served throughout the evening made the experience feel authentically Napa. The courtyard ceremony, the vineyard photos at sunset, and the candlelit barrel room reception gave the entire day a sense of romance and intimacy that we’ll treasure forever. It felt like we were transported to Tuscany, but with the convenience and charm of Napa Valley. If you’re considering V. Sattui for your wedding—do it. It’s not just a venue; it’s an experience that will stay with you and your guests for a lifetime. We feel so lucky to have started our forever in a place this beautiful.

We did a destination wedding and Ponte made the process so easy. The venue is beautiful and they have preferred vendors. Our coordinator, Carly, was amazing. I’m so pleased with her attitude, responsiveness, vision, advice, and willingness to help. There are two ceremony and reception sites that are determined by guest count limitations. We got married by the pond at the Inn and our reception was in the barrel room. Everything was beautiful and perfect. The food-delicious, ambiance-incredible. Let’s not forgot how great the wine is too. For the value and quality of service, food, wine and venue appearance I would 1000000 Xs recommend you get married here!

We got married at Scribner Bend in May 2025 and it was a dream from start to finish! Scribner Bend was the only venue we visited during our wedding planning process because we felt so pleased with the beauty, charm, pricing, and process they offered. We were especially pleased by how much was included in the venue package that we didn’t have to coordinate separately, like lighting, tables, and chairs. Shaye was an absolute delight to work with and we always felt cared for. As a queer couple, it was so nice to feel welcomed and accepted by Scribner Bend and all of their preferred vendors we spoke with. May was the perfect time to be there, the white roses on the arches were in bloom which complemented the rest of our florals beautifully. Our whole day flowed so smoothly thanks to Deija, our day-of planner provided by Scribner Bend, and all of the rest of the staff. All of our guests were so complimentary of the wine, the setting, and the flow of the evening. We really could not have wished for a better venue experience. We also want to note, Paesanos was an exceptional caterer! I know some might be concerned with not having a choice of caterer but we found it to be a relief (one less vendor to coordinate) and Paesanos did a fantastic job. Rain was amazing at communication, and Diana was wonderful to work with on the day. They even packed up a couple of containers of leftovers for us to go home with. Thank you, Scribner Bend, for being an excellent venue!
