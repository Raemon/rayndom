Cool magical wedding venue with lovely people to work with!

We had the absolute best experience having our wedding at Colony! For our wedding of just over 100 people the space was perfect for both the ceremony and reception. The atmosphere was magical, and everyone was so nice and helpful at every step of the way! Seriously, the staff, the sound engineer, the bartenders, security, everyone was great. We worked with the chef on a customized menu for a buffet style dinner and appetizers that was delicious and that we got so many compliments on! Laura was our main contact, and she was super friendly, easy to work with, and ready to answer all my nitpicky questions. Also, being a music venue, they of course had a fantastic recommendation for a band that we ended up using that everyone loved!

Fantasy Wedding

My husband and I were married at The Colony in the fall of 2019. We had a Dungeons & Dragons themed wedding and the venue was the perfect setting for our theme! We used the imperial staircase to frame us for the ceremony and the DJ for our reception was set up on the existing stage. The tea house next to The Colony was provided to the wedding party to dress and prepare for the event, which was truly a blessing when it came to timeliness.   
The staff all around, from the owners to the event planner, and all front and back end staff, were very professional and courteous. I was nervous planning an event this big and I don't think I could have done it without them! One of the staff members happened to play D&D and had asked if it was okay to dress up for our wedding (which, of course it was!)! The bar staff had three specialty drinks prepared for our wedding with names to match our theme!  
The food was incredible and something we still talk about years later. We opted not to have a traditional wedding cake, but they had a dessert menu for us to choose from and it was delicious.   
The venue and facilities were very clean and while we chose not to utilize it, they have an outdoor space with plenty of room for dancing as well! As a former resident of Ulster County, I grew up visiting The Colony all the time and I am so happy I was able to host one of the biggest days of my life in a space that holds so much importance to my childhood. I still visit when I go back, and I plan to host more events here in the future.

GET MARRIED HERE.  
  
My husband and I threw the raddest party of all time thanks to the Colony and its people. We wanted a not-so run-of-the-mill wedding venue and we hit the jackpot in Woodstock!  
  
We worked with Laura to coordinate things from a-z and she made everything we asked for happen. The Chef was also incredibly cool and accommodating - we came up with a nontraditional menu that included some of our favorites foods - it was awesome. Also, great, GREAT bartenders and staff. They were all thoughtful and engaged all night.  
  
We are SO happy we got to tie-the-knot at Colony and wish we could do it all over again. Looking forward to coming back for shows all summer. 10 stars.

The best venue! The loveliest people! Had a wonderful wedding at Colony. 

The best venue! The loveliest people! Had a wonderful wedding at Colony.   
  
We got married at Colony, Woodstock NY on July 7th. Our wedding guest count was a little above 100 and it was a perfect amount for the venue. The place itself is incredibly charming with plenty of space for dinner and dancing. Guests had the ability to relax outside or upstairs whenever wanted to.   
Our go-to person was Laura. From the minute that we met her, we became friends! She was very attentive and warm and responded to a million text messages throughout the yearly planning process. She was a crucial part of making our special day unforgettable! All the information and inspiration that she shared with us was immensely helpful. Cannot imagine the planning process without her.   
  
We loved that together with the bridal and groomsman parties, we had access to the Tea House. This is where we placed quite a lot of our decorations and had all the ladies get ready the day of.   
Everyone that we worked with was very flexible and calm. It ended up raining about an hour before our planned, outdoor ceremony in front of the Tea House. The staff was very prompt in arranging the inside space. Overall, we cannot rave enough about how prompt, professional and welcoming the staff of Colony was. After the ceremony, they seamlessly changed the floor layout from row seating to 6-8 people tables. It was a very smooth transition. And just after a few minutes, all guests were getting drinks and amazing food.   
Now, we have to give a special shout-out to chef and kitchen staff. Unbelievably delicious food! And so much of it! The chef is open to making arrangements to all dietary restrictions during the planning process. Again, all our guests loved the food!  
Throughout the entire day and night, everyone at the Colony was making sure that things were running smoothly. From security and greeting, to the sound engineer that made sure that our live and dj music sounded great. Everyone put in tremendous effort. And of course, the servers and bartenders. Every drink was delicious, so many specialty and rare drink options were available. (Thank you for all the espresso martinis that kept us going!).   
We loved the place so much that we all came back the next day and enjoyed the beer garden food, drinks, live music and atmosphere. It was a perfect “hair of the dog”.  
  
The wedding was magical and perfect! We are thrilled with our special day and will cherish these memories forever. We also have beautiful pictures from the day as the venue is very charming with a lot of unique features. Lastly, we loved hearing how much our guests enjoyed the ceremony and reception.  
Thank you again to all the staff at Colony!

Perfect historic space with excellent team 

My husband and I are so happy that we chose The Colony as our wedding venue for our special day. When looking at wedding venues we both knew it was important to us as Woodstock natives to find a unique local venue within our price range with an authentic, semi-casual atmosphere to reflect our roots and journey together. The day was perfect - our guests still talk about the quality of the food, and the beautiful setting in a historic building. Laura, the private events coordinator and her team at Colony did a wonderful job making things seamless as we planned for our big day. Laura did an amazing job shepherding me through the whole process with patience and professionalism from the very first meeting until our wedding day. The teahouse next door on the property was a beautiful setting for the bridal party to prepare and take time out during the celebrations, and the upstairs billiard room which included a fireplace and comfortable seating also lent an air of sophistication for the groomsmen. And the main ballroom with its wraparound balcony is breathtaking, not to mention it has been voted best music venue in the Hudson Valley for the past couple of years. All in all, we're so glad we now get to reminisce about how we were married right off the village green in Woodstock, NY our historic and eclectic hometown. I'd encourage any other couples considering getting married in the Catskills to consider this historic venue as the perfect place to exchange vows.

Incredible Experience 

I was married at Colony in September 2022. From the moment I reached out to colony and communicated with Laura via e-mail I could tell this was going to be a different kind of venue, and the sort of place I wanted to get married in. Laura was kind, professional, and beyond accommodating to us. She met with us multiple times throughout the process to talk about the day, plan the menu, let us peak at the space to make sure it was right. She was incredibly flexible with us and made time whenever it fit our schedule. She was quick to answer all of our questions and help quell any and all of our fears and anxieties (and trust me- there was a TON of anxiety.) Her reassurances were not just an empty gesture, because she truly delivered the day off. She was available and attentive not just throughout the entire planning process but also the day of the wedding. I know she worked hard to coordinate the staff and to make sure everything was to our liking and specifications. She helped make our day perfect and I am eternally grateful to her.   
  
The ceremony took place outside, the lawn looked lovely and the chairs were set up as perfect as they could be given the amount of people for a small space. They were hosting an October Fest in the backyard and paused the music for us so we could have quiet for our ceremony.   
  
The venue itself is beautiful and unique, it’s a vast space that allows for people to spread out and choose their own fun. The space felt ethereal the night of. I’m a DIYer so the decorations were pretty sparse, but honestly I didn’t feel the space needed it. The building has its own beauty and presence and doesn’t need much to shine.   
  
The real stars of the show were the staff. The servers, Amy and Jane were outstanding- they were kind, patient, engaging, and fun! They worked their butts off for us and smiled the entire time. The bartenders- incredible! I’ve never heard so many compliments about drinks at a wedding. We were a large and thirsty group and they kept up with us the whole night, leaving no one to wait for a drink for too long. And they made excellent drinks! The security guards Jacqui and Justin- my true MVP’s of the night! These two helped us in ways I didn’t know I would need them. Not only did they do security detail but they moved chairs, helped me clean up, looked after my things, and helped wrangle my guests. I can’t express how much I appreciate them. Their kindness did not go unnoticed by us and we are grateful to them. The sound guy, Max- also wonderful- he made the band sound incredible, and he was kind enough to show me how to plug my playlist in after the band left.   
  
Oh we can’t forget about the food! It was delicious- the kitchen staff went above and beyond and prepared an incredible meal for us. There were plenty of options for people. The chef was even kind enough to bring my mom a to-go platter completely on his own accord. A truly thoughtful gesture that was greatly appreciated.   
  
Our guests keep raving about how much fun they had. Multiple have called it “the best wedding they’ve ever been to.” Everyone was incredibly complimentary about the staff, food, drinks, the space, everything.   
  
There was very little “bad” about the entire night- I actually wouldn’t categorize anything as “bad” but I know all feedback is appreciated, so here it is. Regarding the food- we had asked for a small serving of kid friendly food (specifically chicken fingers and fries) during cocktail hour- this was missing, however to be fair, it was not missed. There were far fewer children there than we had anticipated and none of them starved. During dinner there was one dish that we had on our menu that was missing- it was a vegetarian dish, I think a cauliflower schnitzel. But again, it was not missed- there was plenty of food and more than enough vegetarian and vegan options. We didn’t even realize it was missing until the next day.   
  
My guests participated in some true debauchery, something we all really needed given the times. I hope the staff was entertained by the late night antics of old friends who have had too much to drink.   
  
They even gave us use of multiple spaces to get ready day off. There’s a small tea house next to the venue that my bridesmaids and I used to get ready- it was wonderful to have that space on site. My Husband and his groomsmen used the Billiards room, some truly great photos came from that. They even let us keep our dogs in the Tea House throughout the night, as it was important to us to have them in our ceremony.  
  
We are so happy with how everything turned out. It’s cliché to say, but it truly was the best day of our lives, and Colony made it possible for us. I always loved Colony as a music venue and I’m so happy I still get to visit it and revel in the magic of that day.
