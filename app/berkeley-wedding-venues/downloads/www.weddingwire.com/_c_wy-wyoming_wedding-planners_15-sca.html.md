BLEW MY MIND!!!!!!! I had a vision; I wanted a fall-colored wedding in July! I told Tracie my colors, my theme and boom............. She made the most gorgeous bouquet & boutonniere for my husband and I. When she walked out with my flowers my jaw hit the floor. They were the most beautiful flowers I had ever seen! She even threw in pheasants feathers for a personal touch because she took the time to get to know us. I would highly recommend you let Save the Date Flower and Wedding Studio be part of your special day!

Jeanette from Grand Teton Events is seriously the "wedding whisperer". She really knows what she is doing, and she made our wedding so magical. She was completely and overwhelmingly amazing. Prior to my wedding day she was extremely helpful with finding other vendors who she knew and trusted. Additionally, she helped keep me organized and on task as my husband and I undertook the daunting task of planning a mountain destination wedding. When we arrived at our venue prior to our wedding rehearsal, Jeanette came early and helped me organize all the decor we had lugged from Houston, TX to Victor, ID. She walked us through venue and showed us the best spots for various parts of the wedding (as we were planning from a distance it was hard to do before hand). During the rehearsal she even volunteered to officiate for us when our officiant didn't arrive on time (luckily, he was ok, and it was just an issue with the cell service and extremely/unforeseen roadwork wait times). But her willingness to take any problem and to wipe that problem away is just one of the many reasons my now husband and I absolutely adored her. On the day of the wedding, she went above and beyond. I gave her my decor ideas and handed off all the decor to her and she was able to use my stuff and made everything look more incredible than I could have ever imagined. If there were any issues on the day of the wedding, I still haven't heard about them!!! I literally just relaxed with my bridesmaids, got my hair and makeup done, and when I looked out of the window, everything was done. Which is what every bride DREAMS of for her wedding day. HIRE GRAND TETON EVENTS. You won't regret it.

We hired Cara in the month leading up to our wedding at Grand Targhee for same day coordination and she was fantastic. She helped make sure we knew what was covered by all our vendors and reached out to them to make sure all our ducks were in a row. She is so helpful and made me feel at ease leading up to the day. She helped our wedding day run so smoothly. We had forgotten the groomsmens ties and she pulled off a miracle getting us replacements! And she made sure all our details were in the right place and the venue staff was running on schedule. I absolutely would recommend A Day To Remember for a stress free wedding day!

I truly thought I could plan my wedding on my own — and I was completely wrong. Three months out, I had only booked the venue and was overwhelmed. Lyall stepped in and immediately took over every detail, from vendor communication to logistics and timelines, and all of my stress disappeared. She completely understood my vision, provided thoughtful options, and executed everything flawlessly. Working with Lyall was seamless, calming, and truly enjoyable. If you want a 10/10 wedding, hiring Lyall is a must. I cannot recommend her highly enough.

Carol was amazing from start to finish. We had a difficult vendor that we had to work with and she took the lead without a fuss! Our wedding was ABOVE ours and even our guests expectations. The amount of work she puts into your wedding goes unnoticed and lifted a huge weight off our shoulders.

Camille was an absolutely terrific wedding planner and coordinator. She was highly professional, calm and collected, extremely responsive, and on top of it at all times. She was a joy to work with throughout the months leading up to our wedding, and provided insightful assistance at every step of the way. When the day finally came, she executed every aspect of the wedding to perfection. We couldn't have done it without her and we can't recommend her enough!

Ashley is the best of the best! I would use her again any day and she helped make sure the day went smoothly and that my groom didn't see me before I came down the isle. Weddings in spring are hard especially in Wyoming where the weather is ever changing. Ashley made sure to stay flexible and respond quickly even with her new born baby needing her to help me as a wavered back and forth on if the wedding should be inside or out. She was willing to do whatever it takes to make the day perfect and thought of things my groom and I never would have thought about. There is no doubt in my mind we would use her over and over again. I recommend you do the same! You wont regret it!!

I was able to send pictures and ideas to her and she knew what I wanted. I was having a destination wedding and email and phone conversations were the only way to plan. Her team on the day of was amazing!! I did not have to worry about anything! She turned a wide-open hangar into a beautiful wedding and reception venue! The attention to detail and time was truly wonderful!
