Nicole & the entire team at Sawyer Family Farmstead are absolutely INCREDIBLE!

Nicole & the entire team at Sawyer Family Farmstead are absolutely INCREDIBLE! I seriously can not recommend them highly enough. I planned my wedding from across the country (which I assumed would be really stressful) and Nicole made it a piece of cake. We had regularly scheduled calls throughout the entire process, and she was always able to answer my questions right away which put me at ease. We ended up loving every local vendor that she recommended we use, and she was always professional and efficient when working with them. Nicole took the time to meet with us for multiple site walks whenever we were in town visiting, and always listened to any feedback I had. The day of the wedding could not have gone more perfect and that was all thanks to Nicole's planning skills! All of the staff at Sawyer Family Farmstead are so accommodating and friendly & it was such a wonderful experience working with them!!

Exceeded all expectations and we couldn't be happier! 

We chose Chimney Pond for our wedding venue and couldn't have been happier! There are so many positive things to say about this venue outside of it's beautiful views. We initially spoke with Lauren and Raquel, but then worked primarily with Brooke and her team throughout the planning process, and she was incredible! We didn't want family to be stressed with setting up or breaking down for the event, so to have the venue do all of that was well worth the price. They provided a preferred vendor list who were all incredible and so friendly and professional. Their portal makes it so easy to organize the event, and being someone who tracks on spreadsheets, I loved being able to see all of the details in one location. It really helped make the planning process less stressful. Brooke was always available for messaging or a phone call and would give her thoughts and recommendations when we were unsure or wanted her help. It unfortunately started to rain the morning of our wedding and some throughout the day, which of course had me nervous and emotional. Brooke and her team were on it, from watching the radar to having umbrellas available, wiping down the chairs, and even pushing the ceremony time back so we could have it outside. It truly meant so much that they were doing everything possible for us to have the ceremony outdoors with the beautiful views. We didn't have a "dream wedding" in mind coming into wedding planning and felt like we were making a lot of decisions quickly (less than 1 year engagement), but after seeing it all come together, it came to be our dream wedding, and they made it all happen! Thank you for making our big day so special and so memorable! We can't thank you enough!

The perfect micro-wedding venue!

Chimney Pond Farm went above and beyond to make our day perfect! Brooke was extremely helpful and responsive during the planning process. We didn't have to worry about a thing during on our wedding day, as Brooke made sure everything ran smoothly.

A Dream Wedding Venue 

We cannot say enough wonderful things about Chimney Pond Farm in Glenville, NC! From the moment we first inquired, their communication was clear, professional, and incredibly responsive. Planning a wedding can be overwhelming, but their team made everything feel smooth, official, and stress-free.  
  
We selected Chimney Pond as our wedding venue in 2023 and got married May of 2024.  
  
The venue itself is absolutely breathtaking — nestled in the heart of the mountains with panoramic views that look like they belong in a magazine. It's the perfect blend of rustic charm and natural elegance, making it ideal for both intimate and larger celebrations.  
  
What really stood out to us, beyond the stunning scenery, was the level of care and service we received. The team at Chimney Pond Farm truly goes above and beyond for couples. They were supportive every step of the way — offering helpful suggestions, coordinating logistics, and making sure every detail was in place. We never felt alone in the process; they genuinely cared about making our day perfect.  
  
Let me first say that Raquel (venue coordinator) was one of the reasons we selected this venue. She was an amazing wedding coordinator and a blessing for working through barriers on our wedding day. She was able to adapt our dance floor into our wedding ceremony site due to continuous rain. I appreciated her supportive nature and willing to make my dreams come true.   
  
They offer a variety of services and packages that made planning easier, and their experience shows in how seamlessly everything was executed. From vendor coordination to on-the-day support, they handled it all with grace and professionalism.  
  
If you're looking for a magical, memorable, and stress-free wedding experience, we wholeheartedly recommend Chimney Pond Farm. It was the best decision we made, and we will cherish those memories forever!

Venue review

  
Brooke Robinson supported my entire time planning my wedding. She never made me feel discouraged when my own life took precedence over planning. I went through several major life events in the five months leading up to my wedding, and I was… pretty far off course from any “checklist” Pinterest decided to spit at me. I came to her several times in near tears from the anxiety of the upcoming day and each and every time she encouraged me with where I was and gave me feasible steps to take. Her compassion, humor and competency was a godsend. She balanced utmost professionalism with form of empathy that I would only wish everyone else planning a major event gets to experience. She never showed an ounce of stress to me, planning and on the day of, to the point that I was basically uninvolved on my wedding day up until I walked down the aisle. She coordinated the band (Emerald Empire shout out), catering (Sage and spice— nothing but raves), cake (Gateaux cake. First time I’ve seen all desserts gone at a function until mine!), and so much more. I may have been the bride, but she was the star of the show in my eyes.   
  
She clearly was working with a team I didn’t get to spend time with personally, but suffice to say they all knew exactly what they were doing. I especially want to take time to thank Jared who helps run the farm but also was our bartender!! Our guests loved him and his team as well and he was exceedingly kind to work with.   
  
Giving CPF a 5/5 doesn’t feel like enough justice, but it’s all I’m eligible to give.   
  
(P.s. they were even kind to me the day after my wedding, when I had accidentally left my WEDDING DRESS of all things at the house we rented 🫠 type B doesn’t even begin to describe me)

November Wedding (Chantel & Eric)

Chimney Pond Farm is the most beautiful venue I have ever seen! I feel so lucky to have been able to have my wedding there! From beginning to end, Chimney Pond farm was exceptional. When I first reached out to them regarding a venue tour via zoom, I spoke with Lauren, who was so sweet and felt like family by the end of our call. Once I made the easy decision, that this venue was the one for my husband and I, I was connected with their wedding coordinator, Raquel. Raquel and her partner Brooke were a dream, they always answered no matter the time, were always checking in to see what I needed, and helped me through the whole process. Raquel always made me feel at ease in the months leading up to my wedding, she has the best ideas, and is always there when you need her! Once I arrived the week of my wedding, she let me drop off anything and everything the day before my rehearsal and even helped us unload our vehicles, which was so sweet! As a bride, of course I forgot something and didn't know what to do. I forgot to write the table cards, so guests would know which table they were sitting at for the reception, Raquel told me not to worry and did them for me and printed them the night before the wedding, which was a lifesaver because I didn't have a printer at my Airbnb. Raquel goes above and beyond and you can tell she truly cares about her brides! She helped me reapply my fashion tape before I entered the reception and bustled my dress. Without her my wedding would not have gone off without a hitch and I would not have been able to be so care-free. The actual venue itself is very well maintained and looks beautiful all year round. My wedding was in November, so it was still Fall and the pictures are breathtaking! They provided all of my wedding guests with golf cart escort, as well as my bridal party. The overlook barn was perfect and the reception barn was extremely clean and decorated beautifully! My wedding was an absolute dream because of this venue and their wonderful staff. I cannot wait to go back on anniversaries or bring my little ones, once I have some. Highly recommend this venue, pictures don't do its beauty justice and their staff is the cherry on top!

My dream wedding!

We just had our wedding there last weekend and WOW is all I can say. Chimeny Pond is not only the most beautiful venue but the team and level of hospitality is amazing!! They made sure we had everything we needed and made my wedding day seamless! I could not recommend a wedding venue more. (Raquel and Brooke crushed it)!

Unforgettable Wedding

Chimney Pond Farm is an absolutely breathtaking venue and we had the most amazing wedding there. From the very beginning the staff was so incredibly professional, friendly, and helpful. On our big day, Raquel and Brooke were outstanding! They took complete control over the event in the best ways possible; making sure that any issues were handled quickly, that we had everything we needed, and that everyone had the most amazing time. Every person wasn't just friendly, you could tell that they truly connected with us and wanted to make sure our wedding was everything that we had pictured. I have nothing but praise and high recommendation for Chimney Pond Farm and their team.

Chimney Pond Farm Experience

Chimney Pond Farm was professional and lovely from day one of planning! They were incredibly helpful with sorting out details that we never would have thought of without them. They made sure we were prepared for every step of the day which ensured that we were calm and able to fully enjoy every moment. The venue itself is so beautiful and provided the most breathtaking view for the most special moment of our lives. Every detail of the day was taken care of from getting ready in the bridal cottage to the send off. They coordinated all of our vendors day of and everything went so smoothly. Cannot recommend them enough!

Summer Destination Wedding

Our families traveled from Texas, Maryland, and Wisconsin for our daughter's wedding. This venue offers a beautiful scenery for the wedding ceremony. The AIRBNBs on property are updated, comfortable and provide an opportunity for guest/family to stay on property. Our wedding coordinator, Raquel, is one of the hardest working individuals. She will make sure your wedding is perfect and you don't stress throughout the process. I would highly recommend this venue!

This is one of my favorite places to officiate weddings! You can't really beat the amazing views from the ceremony site, which is perched atop a mountain overlooking a lake, mountains, and trees. The reception space is also impressive, and the staff and service is top-notch!
