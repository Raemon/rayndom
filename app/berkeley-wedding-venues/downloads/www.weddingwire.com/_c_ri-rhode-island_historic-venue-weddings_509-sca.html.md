We just wanted to take a moment to thank the entire crew at Hope Events on Main for everything they did to make our wedding day so special. From the planning to the day-of coordination, you made the whole experience smooth, stress-free, and absolutely beautiful. We are so grateful for your attention to detail, calm energy, and the way the team made everything come together seamlessly. Our day was truly unforgettable, and we know it wouldn’t have been the same without you and the Hope Events team.

My husband and I were very excited to have the Duck and Bunny make our wedding cupcakes. Duck and Bunny is a great choice because they offer vegan and gluten free flavors as well as traditionally baked desserts. I'm vegan, so this was very important to me. The day of the wedding there was a slight mix up in that we were delivered mini cupcakes rather than full size cupcakes. We were asked if we wanted them to bring us more cupcakes or have a refund, and we said we needed more cupcakes. They did bring lots more cupcakes, and they also ended up giving us a partial refund, which I really appreciated. That was a very nice gesture on their part. The owner is wonderful to work with in person and also over email, and the cupcakes were all delicious!

My husband and I wanted a venue that didn't scream "typical wedding venue." As soon as we saw the library, we saw the potential. I will admit - the venue is almost TOO different that I was stressed out about all of the non-traditional logistics (countless stairs, dinner in a separate room, dancing in the sunken courtyard) - right up until I actually walked into the venue on my wedding day. I cannot believe how incredible the space looks once it's all done up - my jaw dropped when I walked inside. The library truly looks 100x better on your wedding day (the lighting package is a MUST) - and all of those "non traditional" factors I was worried about actually made for the most incredible photos. We received countless compliments on the venue, so many of our guests asked how we found it. Beyond the venue, RM was fantastic to work with. The schedule flowed seamlessly, and they have this venue figured out perfectly. The food was delicious, and everyone went above and beyond to make us happy...our newlywed attendant was a star. Lastly, this venue gives your endless photo opportunities around Providence - I can't recommend taking photos at the State House enough. Our wedding felt romantic and classic - just as we envisioned.

The Vanderbilt was the perfect place to host our intimate wedding. We wanted our celebration to feel like a comfortable, upscale dinner party and the venue absolutely delivered. We had our ceremony poolside and cocktail hour and dinner in the garden. From the set up, to the excellent food, to the staff - everything made us feel at home. Although there were some staffing changes while we were planning, the hand-off between venue coordinators was seamless and everyone was responsive. Our guests loved the newly renovated and designed interiors. We would choose this venue again in a heartbeat.

We are so thrilled that we got married at Oakes Ames Memorial Hall. We held the ceremony in the downstairs hall and the reception in the great hall upstairs. It was wonderful to have everything in the same place. We loved the flexibility of being able to choose our own vendors and decorations. Joan and the building staff were outstandingly helpful. It is such a gorgeous space with unique details that made our wedding feel different and special.

We hosted our wedding at Kilburn Mill on September 3, 2022. When we initially toured the venue in February of 2021, Robb had recently taken over and was working on reinvigorating the event space at the mill following the pandemic. We loved Robb's honesty and general vibe. He has his shit together, but he's also very kind and was so helpful as we kicked-off our wedding planning process. He really sold us on the vision that he had for the Kilburn Mill Event space. We put our trust in Robb and MAN, did he deliver! We held our ceremony on the roof deck overlooking the water. Robb's team helped ensure that everything was decorated and set up the way that we had envisioned it. For cocktail hour, Robb helped us choose the most amazing signature cocktails -- blueberry vodka lemonade and a watermelon margarita! They were SO good! And he even made sure to have 'Gansett on hand for my husband. Kyle was our right-hand-man on the day of the event and he did an awesome job making sure everything was running smoothly. The venue has so much history and is so unique. Our guests loved it, too! We haven't stopped hearing compliments about what a cool venue it is and we cannot wait to get all of our photos back from our photographer!
