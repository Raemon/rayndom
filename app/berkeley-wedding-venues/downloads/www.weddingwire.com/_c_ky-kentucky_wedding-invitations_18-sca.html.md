Angela did amazing & whimsical calligraphy on our inner and outer envelopes for our wedding. She was less than it was going to cost to have them printed and her writing was charming & unique. Even the drive to Lexington was no big deal, because she had flexibility on when I could come drop them off and pick them up. That ended up late at night and then picked them up on a weekend. She had them done in no time and they were PERFECT!

A & B designs helped us create completely custom wedding invitations. We gave them an idea of what we wanted, they created several different options for us, and then made small changes until it was perfect. We chose a very simple design on white letterpress invitations with printed addresses. The letterpress made our invitations feel luxurious and expensive. They also created matching custom thank you notes and place cards, which was a perfect little detail to our wedding. The place cards were a last minute addition that were made and shipped to us just one week out from the wedding. Although, A & B designs is in Kentucky and I live in Michigan, working from a distance was incredibly easy because of their responsiveness and willingness to work via email. I would choose A & B designs every time.

Paducah Printing provided my Save the Date magnets, my invitations and the caligraphy, the labels for the wine bottles, the wrappers for the cigars, and the programs for the wedding. Each were EXCEPTIONAL. Judy McElrath was my contact and she got everything done on time and even delivered the items to me so I didn't have to pick them up. I would highly recommend using Paducah Printing!

Jan did a great job of listening to what I wanted and recommending paper stock vendors for the printing part of the process. Her work is so beautiful and everyone commented that our invitations were "simply elegant." She pours her heart into her work.

I ordered my wedding invitations from Etcetera this May. The woman spent about 45 minutes with me analyzing everything to make sure I had a perfect invitation. Within days, I had a proof from the company. Everything came in quickly and my invitations are classic and just everything I wanted.
