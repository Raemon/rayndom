Lovely venue

Wonderful indoor and outdoor spaces for photos. Ceremony and reception areas are beautiful enough to not need much decor. I received many compliments from guests on my venue selection. Owners are a nice family that are easy to work with and accommodating. Not overly restrictive at all. They are also very responsive in scheduling tours, booking, and answering any questions. Venue price is reasonable. Plus cute animals are on the farm.

Perfect Wedding Venue 

Almquist Farm is stunning and we had the best day. It has such a great set up for ceremony and reception, it's truly beautiful inside and outside. The staff are so friendly and professional, they made our day special by getting some custom things for us. It was absolutely a steal in terms of price. So many of our guests told us it was one of the most beautiful weddings they had ever been to. 10/10 recommend.

October Wedding 

Almquist Farm is amazing! They made my special day even more special! The grounds look beautiful with the rolling hills and easy access to the outdoor ceremony space. The cenue in general does not need much for decorations. We had a nice bonfire going layer in the night that everyone started to make their way our there. And the goats were a big hit for everyone including the kids. The bridal building is perfect, the only negative was not a lot of natural light for the makeup artist in the one room but we made it work just had to keep the grooms away from that side of the building until my makeup was done which made it a fun game and had lots of laugh during that. Paul was great to talk to and helped us with the initial tour and when we came in the first Wednesday of each month he helped alot when we game in with questions he was able to answer them with ease. If I had to do my wedding all over again I would pick almquist Farm everytime! Very professional and family oriented and they really strive to make sure you have a perfect venue for your special day.

So Much More than Pictures Show 

This place is absolutely amazing and the pictures that are shown online only capture a glimpse of what it actually looks like and the shear size and space of everything. Paul and Kari are great to work with and respond very quickly to questions. This place was worth every cent spent!

Amazing location for a wedding

Almquist Farms is a beautiful location to host an outdoor or indoor wedding. Paul and Kari went out of their way to ensure every detail for our kids’ wedding was covered. Paul and Kari were so accommodating and flexible in the wedding planning. This location has everything you need. Lots of space for outdoor and indoor reception seating, goats and chickens to feed, beautiful outdoor altar at the top of a picturesque pasture, lots of room for games and outdoor activities, and a super friendly staff that ensures your guests are talking about the amazing wedding they attended for years to come.

Absolutely perfect venue!

We love Almquist Farm! Our June wedding here was a dream – we feel so lucky that we found this place! The venue itself is stunning, which we appreciate for the beautiful photos and the gorgeous setting the day of. We couldn’t imagine a better place to get married!  
  
Our guests loved the venue, too. The shaded ceremony site really helped out on a warm day, and the birdsong down there is lovely. The lawn beside the barn is awesome for cornhole and tumbling tower, and the kids loved seeing the goats and chickens. We set up our tables around the dance floor so nothing had to be moved (200 guests), and there wasn’t a bad seat in the house. Guests also appreciated the campfire outside, which provided a nice break from the craziness indoors!  
  
We loved working with Paul and Kari, who were really responsive; between their helpfulness and common-sense venue policies, we really felt like they’re in this to share their gorgeous property and help make wonderful memories (especially compared to other venues we toured, who would charge you for tap water if they could!). The bar was also a hit; we were glad that they had good options (things we would drink at home!), and they worked with us to set a bar schedule that worked with our budget.  
  
We’re recommending Almquist to all our friends, not least because we want to go back as guests! Thanks, Paul and Kari, for a lovely experience!

Amazing place to get married 

Almquist did an amazing job with everything. Venue was nice and clean ! Beautiful inside and out. Very easy to work with . Unfortunately the day we got married it rained. But Almquist quickly had a plan in place to transition to an indoor wedding. Bar was also amazing and all the workers were great! Fantastic people with a fantastic venue.

Such a beautiful venue

My guests keep telling me how beautiful it was and how fun the goats are. All of the kids were kept busy and had a great time. Paul and Keri are super nice and easy to work with. My hard-to-please old man farmer guests said the bar had really good service and the bartenders were awesome. It is really such a wonderful venue!

Gorgeous venue!

We wanted to get married within six months and had to make a lot of decisions quickly. We toured other similar venues but Almquist Farm stood out. The landscape was just breathtaking and there was flexibility since they have a beautiful reception hall where weddings can take place indoors year round. Paul and Kari were friendly, informative, and responsive. The granary is a separate building where were were able to get ready with plenty of space and was decorated in a welcoming way. The rolling hills of the landscape made our photos beautiful even in the late fall. The reception hall has tons of windows with lots of natural light and a stunning fireplace where we exchanged our vows. Our guests enjoyed the venue including the goats and kittens that were fenced just outside of the venue. Absolutely wonderful venue that I highly recommend!
