Debbie was amazing!! She helped every step of the way. She was quick to respond and accommodate. She helped us add a COVID addendum to our contract, then gave a full refund when we had to pull the plug on our big day. She was so understanding which we appreciated. This venue has everything and is so affordable for what you get. The courtyard is the perfect space and ambiance with the bistro lights. We loved the fact that the buffet could be covered. They provided tables, chairs, a bar, and staff members for the night. We also loved the front area, before the main doors. It is such a large space that overlooks Papago - perfect area to set up cornhole, tall boy tables, and host your cocktail hour. We also loved that the venue included in the total cost was free parking for guests, indoor restrooms, the option to move inside if need be, a conference room to hold our stuff and get ready in, and letting guests wander the exhibits all night. It's in a perfect location, right in the heart of Papago Park and just steps away from the most beutiful, scenic, desert landscape for photos. And there is so much to do in Tempe for your out of town guests! Right across from the Zoo, ASU campus, and golf course. Lots of nearby hotels and Uber everywhere. We will definitely be recommending this event space to all our friends and family for their weddings!

First - what a great back ground for a corporate venue - among the fabulous art!! Second the staff. Cori & Sara were a pleasure to work with. They were able to provide information in a timely manner and the site was a good price value. On the day of the event, Sara was there with me making sure we had everything we needed. We actually had some last minute needs and the folks there were happy to adjust and help us out. Seriously, the nicest, most helpful people I have worked with at an event. Everyone had a smile for even my most stressful moments and offered solutions with grace.

I’m am beyond impressed with this venue! The grounds are absolutely beautiful, the staff was genuine and attentive during both ceremony and reception and the food was amazing. The wedding suite is stunning and the ambiance of a million twinkling lights against mature landscape is a sight to see. Truly a venue that captures Tucson’s artistic desert charm with elevated service the whole way through!

When searching for a wedding venue we went to several of the usual spots in Tucson, only to be met with someone else's 'vibe' everywhere we went. We were looking for a blank slate of sorts in order to create a wedding that was totally and completely us. We 100% found that in the Tucson Museum of Art. From the moment we first toured to the venue to the actual wedding day, everything was great. Abbey made the planning easy, she was so accommodating and flexible as my ideas and plans shifted over the year. The wedding itself was literal perfection, I would not have changed a single thing about it! The staff working my event were amazing. Since the event, I have had several guests comment on how classy the venue space was and I could not agree more. If I could do it all again, I would book the museum in a heart beat!

We had a rocky start with the venue because they had some staffing changes. Once they got a someone in their coordinator position it was great. They helped us plan the details and used their prior knowledge of weddings to plan an awesome night. The venue was perfect, we had the ceremony in the Planetarium which was unique and our guests loved how it turned out.

We just had our company Holiday Party here for almost 100 guests (about 20 kids). We rented the first floor and it was the perfect size for our group. All of the kids loved playing with the exhibits and climbing the huge structure. The adults enjoyed climbing with the kids and mingling among the tables. The venue coordinator, Alex, made the whole reservation and setup process very easy. The communication was great and I knew exactly what to expect. He and his team were like party ninjas! They were discreet during the event, and yet right there whenever needed. I also received a lot of positive feedback about the food, which is provided through an exclusive contract with Spoonz Catering. The owner, Garry, was super helpful with picking out the menu and coordinating the bar. Overall, we really enjoyed having our event here, and can't wait to have another in the future.
