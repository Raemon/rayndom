We had a phenomenal experience with OMCA. The staff team that helped us with our wedding made sure everything was perfect and were extremely friendly. It was a pleasure working with the whole team.

We had our wedding ceremony, reception and dinner in the gardens of OMCA. We chose it for a number of reasons - the location was fantastic (easy to get to from public transit, had ample parking), it's a unique and fascinating museum (we had an amazing Dorothea Lange exhibit open for guests during the wedding, which people loved), and the gardens are huge, unique and beautiful and lend themselves to a lot of creativity of where to have the reception vs. ceremony, etc. There were a couple things OMCA had going on a few weeks before our wedding - their main wedding events coordinator left, and because the Warriors won the playoffs, they had more events than they had originally planned for. Even with all of this going on, the staff there, Catherine, and in particular Maria, really stepped up to the plate to take care of us and help make our wedding seamless and beautiful. Catherine was very professional in keeping us in the loop and addressing any concerns we had. Maria was incredibly responsive and attentive to every little detail of our wedding. We had a couple complicated requests, in particular with timing surrounding a surprise flash mob and the cake. Maria took the time to speak with us about those extra little details, coordinate with the vendors, and made sure that everything worked wonderfully and that I didn't have to think about a thing on my wedding day. She was a pleasure to work with. The gardens were absolutely magical on our wedding night, and we were very impressed with how the event was handled by OMCA staff. If we had a choice we would do it all over again at OMCA.
