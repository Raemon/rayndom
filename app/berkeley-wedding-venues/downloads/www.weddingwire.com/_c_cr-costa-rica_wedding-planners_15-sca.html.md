Barbara and her team were AMAZING! They made planning an 80+ person destination wedding at a pretty DIY venue feel stress-free and seamless. They brought our vision to life beautifully and recommended really amazing vendors. They made wedding day feel easy and everything was in place. I can’t thank 419 weddings enough for making our day so wonderful. Highly recommend working with them!!

Kate of Luna Weddings was amazing to work with for our wedding this past May. We knew we wanted to have a very intimate ceremony on the beach in Costa Rica (our favorite place) and had no idea how to plan it, so we reached out to Kate and immediately knew she was who we needed. Our micro wedding was literally better than we could’ve imagined, from the set up, florals, timeline, food, everything was perfection. Thank you Kate!!

From the very first meeting, our wedding planner Nati was nothing short of exceptional. She was open, transparent, and incredibly organized, walking us through every step of the planning process with clarity and confidence. She and her team managed every single detail with care, helping us design an event that truly reflected our vision - and then went above and beyond it. Our wedding day was more beautiful and meaningful than we could have imagined. What truly stood out was the way they made sure we were taken care of throughout the entire day, and made all of our guests feel taken care of as well. Their attention to detail, expert budget management, and genuine passion for what they do made all the difference. If you are planning a wedding in Costa Rica, look no further, Nati and her team is definitely the recommendation for you! You´ll be in the best hands possible.

I called Jennifer 2 weeks right before our trip for our 20 year vow renewal. Her team did everything. Beautiful flowers, great mariachi, a pastor, chef who made a beautiful and delicious dinner, best hair stylist I’ve ever hired, and photographer who took beautiful pictures. I couldn’t believe they provided better services than anything I’ve ever received in the states. Absolutely blown away and so glad I picked them. Worth every penny. Super short and intimate ceremony was more than anything I expected. Thank you Jennifer & Marian. Will forever be grateful to you and your entire team for creating the beautiful ceremony we always wanted. ❤️

We cannot say enough wonderful things about Ise and her colleague Mari. From the very beginning, Ise made what could have been an overwhelming process feel completely seamless. For over a year, she kept us on track with thoughtful monthly check-ins, clear timelines, and steady guidance that made planning a destination wedding feel manageable and even enjoyable. Our process was very collaborative. We would brainstorm ideas, big and small, and Ise would either execute them flawlessly or dig deeper, doing additional research and discovery to make sure every detail was done right. She is incredibly reliable, responsive, and calm, which gave us so much confidence throughout the planning journey. She also helped us source truly top-tier vendors in Costa Rica and every recommendation felt thoughtful, vetted, and aligned with our vision. Her expertise and local knowledge made a huge difference. On the wedding day itself, everything ran without a hitch. If anything went wrong, we never knew about it because Ise and Mari handled everything behind the scenes with grace and precision, ensuring the day flowed smoothly from start to finish. What truly sets Ise and her team apart is how they go above and beyond in ways both big and small. On the day of the wedding, Ise noticed my dad’s jacket needed a button and immediately sewed it on herself. When she realized the reception space was getting extremely hot, she quickly brought in fans without us ever having to ask. She also played a key role in helping us thoughtfully decide between an indoor versus outdoor wedding setup, offering guidance that balanced logistics, comfort, and our overall vision. Even with last-minute changes, her team was incredible. When I decided to add tambourines as an activity less than two weeks before the wedding, Ise and her team stepped in without hesitation — printing tags, organizing them, and secretly hiding them so the moment could be revealed during the celebration. It was executed perfectly. Ise and Mari are organized, proactive, creative, and deeply caring. They are the kind of planners who make you feel fully supported while also elevating your ideas. We are endlessly grateful for them and cannot recommend them highly enough to anyone planning a wedding in Costa Rica (or anywhere).

We had the pleasure of working with Heidy’s as our wedding planner, and we can't sing her praises enough. Heidy thoughtful approach and attention to detail truly made our special day uniquely ours. From the moment we started planning, she took the time to understand our vision and made sure every aspect of the day reflected who we are as a couple. Not only did Heidy personalize every detail of the wedding to us, but she also went above and beyond to ensure that our guests had an amazing experience. From the decor to the wedding day activities, everything was meticulously planned to create a memorable and seamless event. Thanks to Heidy’s expertise and organization, the day ran so smoothly, allowing us to relax and enjoy every moment without worrying about a thing. Her professionalism and dedication were truly exceptional, and we couldn't have asked for a better wedding planner. If you're looking for someone who will make your wedding day truly special and unforgettable, we highly recommend Heidy. Thank you for everything, Heidy!

Wow! Where do we start?? HIRE THIS TEAM! When my husband and I decided we wanted to get married in Costa Rica we knew we would need a lot of help. Finding and hiring Erika and her Amore Paraiso team was our best wedding planning decision we made! Erika and her team went above and beyond with everything. Her team met with us when we decided to come visit a year before the wedding to look at venues and go over details in person, even though this was out of the norm. The wedding day design and flow was everything we asked for and more! The team made it feel very “us” and unique to our love story. Our family and friends are still talking about the design and florals months after our big day. Erika pointed us in the right direction for vendor recommendations and we could not be happier with every vendor that was apart of our day. Whenever an issue came up Erika and her team were on top of it, we hardly ever knew if there was a problem. Hire Amore Paraiso for your dream wedding in Costa Rica! You will not be disappointed! They are the best in town 💖 Thank you again Erika and team!!!

We recently had our dream wedding in Costa Rica, and it would not have been the incredible success it was without Cota. From start to finish, she was everything we could have hoped for in a wedding planner and more. Cota is exceptionally organized, patient, and a truly great listener. She took the time to understand our vision and then went above and beyond to bring it to life, often improving on ideas we only loosely described. Her ability to take a concept and execute it flawlessly was one of the biggest reasons our day felt so personal, beautiful, and thoughtfully curated. Planning a destination wedding can be overwhelming, but Cota kept us sane and even made the entire process fun. She’s incredibly knowledgeable about local vendors and has strong relationships with them, which made coordination seamless. On top of that, she was flexible with last-minute changes, always responsive, and a consistently clear communicator. Most importantly, it was obvious how much she genuinely cared about making our wedding perfect. Her kindness, patience, and calm presence were absolutely invaluable throughout the planning process and on the wedding day itself. Will, their Destination Coordinator, was also wonderful—super helpful and relaxed, contributing to the smooth, stress-free experience we enjoyed. In addition to his help with the transportation on our wedding / welcome party, and our day after pool party, we leveraged him to help make travel details easier for our guests. He went above and beyond to ensure their trips went as smoothly as our wedding did. If you’re considering a wedding in Costa Rica, hiring Cota will be one of the best decisions you make. We are endlessly grateful to her for helping us create a day we’ll cherish forever.
