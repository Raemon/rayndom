MichaelAngelos Events does an incredible job! They pay great attention to detail and produce a beautiful backdrop for your wedding. We were recommended to MichaelAngelos by the Mavris in Indianapolis. We hired them to construct our ceremony backdrop, rented an ornate rug to add interest to our ceremony, hang bistro lights in our reception space, as well as the focal point of the evening --- the installation piece above our head table. They were at times a bit difficult to get a hold of, but the end result was breathtaking!

We had an incredible experience working with AAYS for our wedding tent and rentals! From start to finish, they were professional, responsive, and an absolute pleasure to work with. They provided our stunning sailcloth tent, flooring, generators, and restroom trailers—and everything was executed flawlessly. Their team, especially Ashley, was always quick to answer our questions and kept in close communication with our wedding planner throughout the entire planning process. What truly stood out was their patience and dedication—they went back and forth with us several times to help us choose the perfect flooring color, and the end result was beautiful. The tent setup was absolutely gorgeous and truly brought our vision to life. We can't thank AAYS enough for helping make our day so special. Highly recommend them to any couple looking for a reliable and top-notch rental company for their event!

Great local company! We had their services for our wedding back in September. They provided a two stall luxury restroom trailer and an ADA handicap accessible Pink Pot. Their communication was great, service was great, and the equipment that was provided was very very clean and in great condition! I would recommend their services any day of the week. Thank you GOA Trailers for all that you did!

John and his team are our go to's for chair rental. Their customer service is superior and you can tell they genuinely care about the role they play in creating a successful event. I believe these chairs are an essential piece of any upscale event as the chairs contribute so much to the ambiance of the room. His chairs are in pristine condition and would make a great addition to any event. I highly recommend using WeddingChairHolder for events!

Midwest provided our tablecloths for our venue. They were easy to work with and flexible when we had last minute changes.

We used DIY rentals for our wedding rental this past August. We rented our wedding tent, chairs, tables, and various decorations from DIY. DIY Rentals was great to work with from our initial planning meeting with them, various phone and email conversations as adjustments were made to our rental list, set up and take down of our tent and rental items. DIY Rentals was able to take our original photos and ideas and bring them to reality! Holly was very easy to work with and even gave us a few different websites for designing our tent layout and making our seating assignments. DIY Rentals has a large inventory of rentals to select from and was able to color match our linens. Our rental delivery and set up went smoothly and everything was accounted for! I would definitely recommend DIY Rentals to anyone wanting to rent for a wedding or any other special event.

Kelli was the person I was working with through the whole process. Extremely professional and prompt with emailing me back. Prices are a little more expensive than the other rental place in town but it was so worth the little extra money for the type of service I received. They were on time with both drop off and pick up of lighting and catering supplies. The rest of the staff was very considerate as well when they were setting up the lighting asking me questions and taking my opinion seriously. I would highly HIGHLY recommend them for any party supply needs.
