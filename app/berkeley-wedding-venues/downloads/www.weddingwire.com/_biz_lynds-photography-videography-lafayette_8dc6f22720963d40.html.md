Awesome videography experience

Keith is the consummate, professional wedding videographer in every way. We loved working with him as our wedding videographer from start to finish. In our initial meeting, Keith immediately put us at ease with his relaxed manner and good listening skills, asking us about what we wanted from him as our videographer, how he could best serve us, and listening carefully to our responses.  
  
As our wedding day approached, Keith was accessible to us when we needed to update him on our specific videography wishes relating to our wedding day format and program of events. He was able to accommodate our needs and understand exactly what we wanted from our wedding video.  
  
His 30+ years of experience as a wedding videographer shows in how he conducts himself interpersonally as well as behind the camera. On our wedding day, he did an excellent job of capturing the most important elements and special moments of our big day, using two cameras to make sure he got all of the necessary coverage that we wanted. He brought extra sound equipment to make sure that the audio component of our ceremony was fully captured.  
  
The final product was a superb full length video that captured the essence of our wedding day. After viewing the video, we wanted a few edits to be made and Keith promptly made all of those edits.  
  
We couldn't have asked for a nicer, more professional and competent wedding videographer than Keith. Finally, his prices are totally fair and reasonable. We wholeheartedly recommend Keith if you are looking for a superb, experienced wedding videographer.

Great Service and Quality

Lisa was our photographer for both our engagement pictures and our wedding day. She was very professional and did an excellent job. She made the day really fun and was very stress free.  
  
Keith introduced us to Lisa and coordinated/introduced us to her. Keith was very professional and made us excited for our special day! :) Prices are very reasonable for a wedding and we were really happy with how it all turned out.

The best experience we’ve had from a vendor.

The moment you meet Keith in person, you can really tell that he's a genuine person and loves what he is doing. He's very knowledgeable and informative since day one. Lynds Photography was a suggested vendor from our venue and we really didn't regret hiring them. He is very professional and respects your time. He emails you back right away and answers any questions that you might have and is completely honest. They are a one stop shop because they have everything and that is what I love about them. We hired them for our wedding photography, videography, and we also purchased a photo album from them. We already got our pictures and videos back and the quality is superb. We are still waiting for our photo album but he already sent us the preview and as usual, it was beautiful.   
On our wedding day, Keith was doing the videography and our photographer was Adam. Like Keith, Adam was also professional and knowledgeable. He was so easy to work with and made sure that everything is not as complicated as it seems. He's a funny guy yet understandable. He knows how stressed we were on that day and he adjusted himself and made us feel comfortable. Our experience with Lynds Photography was amazing and we highly recommend them. If we are going to get married again, we will for sure hire them over and over.

Picture Perfect

We fell in love with Keith from the moment we walked into his office. He is the perfect balance of personal and professional. He spent some time helping us complete a short questionnaire to get the facts straight, but also spent some time asking questions to get to know us as people and as a couple. In the end, Keith and his team felt like family by the time of the event.  
Throughout the process he has been punctual and precise in his work and communications. From beginning to end we have never had to wait on Keith. He was amazing about reaching out to us and keeping in touch when we felt like we had a million things to do. More importantly we found his involvement to be a calm and grounding experience as he covered all the bases and gave us room to communicate our needs. Coupled with his expert advice from years in the field, we felt very well taken care of the entire time.  
Speaking of expert care, Cindy the photographer was everything we could ever want. As a person, she was so friendly and fun. She moved our crowds around and directed us in pictures with a smile and great sense of humor. I don’t think either of us have ever had such a pleasant experience taking pictures. And as a photographer she is nothing less than brilliant. Cindy didn’t just take pictures, she captured memories. Her pictures are exactly what our memories feel like and we feel blessed to relive them frame by frame.   
The result is a night of memories that we have captured exactly the way we wanted. The pictures are beautiful. The video is perfect. We could not be happier. We’re not ugly by any means but we didn’t know we could look so good either. We truly appreciate Keith and his team and will definitely be working with them again for future events. Hopefully a lifelong partnership will… develop. Thank you Keith, Cindy and team.

Affordable, Professional...Amazing 

Responsive and professional. I did A LOT of research for a photographer beforehand, especially since I wasn't going to be able to meet the vendor prior to our wedding and Keith was incredible. Despite his busy schedule, he took the time to answer ALL of my questions meticulously and thoroughly. The photographer who was assigned changed midway but our final photographer, Tami, was incredible. She was professional, direct, friendly, and talented. I honestly don't think I could ask for more from our photographer choice.

Great wedding photographers

Keith and Adam did an amazing job with our photos. I really enjoyed working with them. I talked to Keith a few weeks before my wedding to plan out how the pictures would go on the day of and any specifics of what I wanted, family pictures etc. Adam was our photographer on our wedding day and he was a delight to work with. My husband HATES taking pictures and he said it was one of the most quick and painless experience he’s had! Adam kept us laughing the whole time and made it a fun experience as we took the wedding party pictures. They worked well with the other vendors and made sure to keep everything on schedule. We got a ton of photos, I would have liked to see less duplicates but I’m happy with them. I would have also jumped for the edited video if our budget had allowed. Overall, it’s a great company to hire.

Lynds was Fantastic! 

What an amazing experience we had Lynds Photography! It was an absolute highlight in our wedding planning and day! Keith was extremely attentive and accommodating in helping to meet our budget. He was very professional and enthusiastic, which helped put my wife and I at ease. Keith's customer service and attentiveness was top notch and one of the main reasons we booked with Lynds. Our photos and video package was far better than we could have hoped for. On top of that Keith's staff designed us a terrific looking album, which my in-laws loved so much,that we are ordering them a clone album. My wife and I would highly recommend Lynds Photo without hesitation to any friends or family
