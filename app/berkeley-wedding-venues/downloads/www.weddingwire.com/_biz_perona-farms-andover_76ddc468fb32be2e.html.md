Nestled on 57 picturesque acres in Andover, New Jersey, Perona Farms is a fifth-generation family-owned estate that has been the backdrop for unforgettable weddings for over a century. Our property features three uniquely designed wedding venues—The Barn, The Refinery, and The Reserve—each offering its own distinctive ambiance and tailored experience.

**The Barn** , originally built in the late 1930s, blends historic charm with modern rustic elegance. With its iconic silos, a fully covered patio with outdoor bar, and a vaulted reception space enhanced with built-in uplighting, The Barn accommodates up to 200 seated guests and offers an effortlessly warm and inviting setting.

**The Refinery** , thoughtfully redesigned in 2020, is a sophisticated fusion of industrial edge and rustic refinement. Featuring exposed white-washed brick, statement lighting, and contemporary furnishings, The Refinery hosts up to 170 guests for a seated reception—or 200+ for a cocktail-style celebration. Its intuitive layout ensures a seamless transition from ceremony to cocktail hour to reception.

**The Reserve** , our newest gem reimagined in 2025, evokes the romance of a Tuscan villa just minutes from home. With rustic wood accents, modern finishes, and space for up to 275 seated guests or many more for a cocktail style event, The Reserve offers a destination wedding feel without the travel.

Our on-site culinary team, supported by our greenhouse, beehives, and partnerships with local farms, curates vibrant, seasonal menus that highlight the freshest ingredients. From artisanal hors d’oeuvres to unforgettable entrées, every bite tells a story.

Perona Farms also offers getting-ready suites for each venue and two charming on-site homes for overnight accommodations—making your wedding not just a day, but a weekend to remember.

We invite you to experience the magic of Perona Farms for yourself. Schedule a tour today and let us help you bring your dream wedding to life.

Highly, highly recommend 

My husband and I got married in the Reserve in October 2025 and there are so many good things we have to say. Perona Farms is truly a dream wedding venue. From start to finish, the experience was exceptional—not only because of the amazing food (which our guests are still raving about), but because of the incredible people who make the entire day run so seamlessly. To start, the Reserve is an absolutely gorgeous venue with so much natural light. Our photographer and videographer could not stop raving about how the lighting in every inch of the venue was perfect for our pictures. I had a guest count of 235 people and was initially very stressed about the size of the main room, if the dance floor would be too small and if the tables would be too close to each other. The space was just fine and while it wasn't the most spacious of rooms, it was also not too crowded. Our guests still talk about how amazing the cocktail hour was, how there was so much food and how the drinks were also amazing. We did not have to add a single thing to the cocktail hour. Now onto talking about the people that helped make our wedding day truly the best day of our lives. Ivette, the main wedding coordinator, was an absolute rock throughout the planning process. She handled every detail with such care and professionalism, and even took the time to schedule a phone call with me to ease my stress over a tricky seating situation. Her calm, thoughtful approach made a world of difference and instantly put me at ease. On the wedding day itself, Maya, our bridal day-of coordinator, was a true gift. Her sweet, calming presence helped organize my very rambunctious crew and kept everything running smoothly without ever feeling rushed or overwhelming. She was so kind, attentive, and reassuring—exactly the energy every bride needs on such a big day. And then there’s Brendan, the most incredible maître d’. He constantly checked in on us, made sure we were well fed and our cups were always full. When our other shuttle failed to show up at the end of the night, Brendan went completely above and beyond by personally driving 30 of our guests back to the hotel in the Perona Farms van. It was such an unexpected act of kindness and care, and something we will never forget. Perona Farms isn’t just a beautiful venue with phenomenal food—it’s a place run by people who genuinely care about you, your guests, and your experience. We couldn’t have asked for a better team or a more perfect day. Highly, highly recommend

Perona Farms Review

My husband & I recently got married at Perona Farms & we had an amazing experience! They made our day of experience seamless & easy. From the start of our day, our bridal attendant was extremely attentive & then our day of coordinator made sure everything was in place at the right time. The service was wonderful & they really made us feel at home! 5 stars! Highly recommend!

Absolutely amazing!

Perona Farms literally stole our hearts as soon as we went for our first tour. Every single person was kind, caring, helpful, and genuinely was there to make our day the best it can be!   
  
Our day of coordinator blew us away with how amazing she was! Special shout out to Kelly who we HAD to request after our food tasting because of how amazing she was. And Tammi is the sweetest, most helpful, genuine person!   
  
This venue was 2 hours away from us and all of our family. And everyone was like “why are you having it so far” and as soon as the day came I had multiple people come up to me and say “I get it now!” Everyone had the best time!

Perona Farms is a dream come true

We had our wedding here back in June and not only is the place absolutely stunning but the way you are taken care of sets a new standard. From the moment you VISIT you’re greeted with great food, drinks, and very warm smiles. The day of the wedding was no different and everything leading up was incredibly organized. I worked with a coordinator (Desirre) essentially up until the wedding day itself and she is incredible at her job. Very kind and personable while holding you accountable to timelines and deliverables. The day of I had Alish attending to me from the morning until the evening and she literally was my saving grace - she brought me food, drinks, held my dress, drove us around the venue, etc. The way the staff treated us but also our guests is more than anyone could ask for. And finally the FOOD!!!! Not just the food for the wedding but the food while we were getting ready, the snacks during your visits, everything was to die for. It feels very farm to table and a lot of it is!!! They make a lot of stuff in house including their smoked salmon which is one of my favorite ever.   
  
Perona - thank you for making dreams come true!!!!

Perfection

As the Father of the bride - i couldnt be more  
Happier with the result. I dont ever think  
U can do perfection but it was pretty darn close  
Beautiful grounds - well thought out space   
And most of all the staff was friendly,happy attentative  
And professional. It is not cheap (( nothing is these days))  
But was well worth it. If u r gonna charge me for   
Quality then give it to me . They did it in spades  
I try to be even minded - not too high not too  
Low - but this was top notch.   
Thank you for making it special

Highly Recommend!

We felt so comfortable and worry-free on our wedding day because of how professional and prepared everyone at Perona was. They went above and beyond our expectations and we received so many compliments from our guests about the venue, food, and service. We couldn't recommend them more!

My Perfect Wedding Day

My wedding day at Perona Farms was the best day of my life! I always wondered what it would be like to be the bride for a change. I've worked at Perona Farms going on 6 years but I didn't want to get married without getting the full experience, so I did my share of searching wedding venues. I can now honestly say with certainty that Perona Farms does it differently. It is such a special experience, I'm tearing up just writing this. When touring other venues I found that Perona provided by far the best package from the service to the food to the all inclusiveness and the personal attention. I did my due diligence, but nothing else compared.   
  
When I came for my tour with Kenny and my Mom, Marley toured us around. She was so excited for me, and walking through the door, you are immediately greeted by a family member most of the time and given a drink and a snack. My mom was blown away with the cheese board we were given, and I told her "Mom, that's just how we do it!" I will be honest, I did not feel that warmth anywhere else that I had toured. I had the opportunity of working with Marley during the planning process and you can easily see she has probably planned over 1000 weddings. No question was a stupid question and bride brain is a real thing you guys so thank god I had her to help with all the details!   
  
From the moment I stepped on the property, I felt a sense of excitement while feeling calm surprisingly because I knew I was in the best hands. I rented the suites on the property and I was able to enjoy the day with my family and friends. This was probably one of my favorite moments from my wedding day. Cathy was my suite attendant and she made sure I was drinking a mimosa and not stressing about a thing. Cathy has a calming aura about her and my entire bridal party felt that. My coordinators were Ana and Maya. They took care of all the details regarding my decor, first look, ceremony etc. They could not have done a better job in easing my mind that everything was being taken care of. I really was assured they've got it all under control, and they certainly did!  
  
Arriving at the venue after pictures and before the ceremony I saw the space decorated with my decor for the first time and I was in awe of how beautiful everything looked even having to retouch my makeup because I cried. The nerves set in right before walking down the aisle and Rob, Perona's marketing manager, calmed me down. I don't know if I would have made it down the aisle without his words of encouragement and the glass of water he gave me since I was moments away from passing out!  
  
Brendan was my maitre-d' and he was great! He and his team made sure the evening went smoothly. He made sure the timing was perfect and that Kenny and I were always smiling and having a blast while simultaneously doing a phenomenal job taking care of all my family and friends!   
  
This review would not be complete without mentioning THE DELICIOUS FOOD!!! My family had never been to an event at Perona Farms and they were just blown away by the abundance of food at cocktail hour, the lobster tail first course, the fresh scallops and everything else that I have been coming home raving about for years. I could go on and on...Did I mention we are Italian!! I am so happy my family had the opportunity to experience first hand what I get to see everyday.   
  
I just wish I could relive this day over and over, it really flies by. I want to thank the entire staff and Family of Perona Farms. It is no wonder you have upheld your reputation for 107 years as a family owned and operated business. They don't let one minor detail fall through the cracks. It is an honor to be a part of the team and family. Being on the other side as an event coordinator has even more of a special meaning to me now!

HIGHLY recommend - Perona Team is amazing and the place is beautiful

One of the main reasons we chose to get married at Perona Farms was how prepared they are for every and any situation. We loved that the Refinery had the atrium, so we were able to keep it open as it was a nice day. However, if it had rained the ceremony would still be in the atrium but it would be closed. Perona took the stress of moving the ceremony away.   
  
The cocktail hour had everything we could have possibly imagined, highlighted by their brick oven pizza station. Everything tasted AMAZING and all of our guests were coming up to us saying how good the food is.   
  
The Perona team was incredibly helpful, sticking with us the whole night for whatever we needed and helped make sure this was the greatest day of our lives.   
  
Ivette helped make the process seamless and easy from start to finish. We could not recommend Perona highly enough. We are so grateful for the Perona team and being able to have our wedding in the Refinery!

Unbeliveable Experience 

5STAR REVIEW!!! Perona Farms exceeded our expectations and provided the best service, food, and ambiance. If you are considering booking Perona, please take this as your sign to move forward. I can not thank the team enough for their attention to detail, kindness, and overall five-star performance at our wedding. Perona was everything you could hope for in a venue. Being in the events business (and planning weddings for five years in my career), I tend to hold venues and coordinators to a higher standard than most, and Perona did not disappoint. Tammi, our on-site coordinator was a ROCKSTAR!! We absolutely loved her - she made us feel like family, helped when anything came up and completely saw our vision and executed it flawlessly.   
  
We really can not say enough about Perona. Megan, our day-to-day coordinator was also a pleasure to work with - and may I mention, even though this has nothing to do with reviewing the place, she has awesome freaking style and is an absolutely delightful human!! :)  
  
For real though - run, do not walk, to book Perona Farms. We offered the duet-plated meal with the lobster tail appetizer and it was such a hit - guests are still talking about it well after the fact!! We seriously could go on and on about how great everything was but we really just want to thank the entire team of Perona for providing us with the perfect venue for our wedding. We know it was such a success because of all the effort put in behind the scenes by the team.   
  
Our sincerest gratitude to all of you!
