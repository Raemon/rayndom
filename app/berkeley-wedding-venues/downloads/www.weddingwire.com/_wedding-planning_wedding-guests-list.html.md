  * ## Get started

Creating your Wedding Guest List can be a daunting task, but our easy-to-use tool keeps everything in one spot. Start by adding all the wedding guests you’d like to attend, then build out the list from there with RSVP info, meal choices and more.

  * ## Stay organized

So, who made the cut? Once you add family and friends to the Wedding Guest List, you’re ready to add more info, like addresses, RSVPs and gifts. Because each guest comes with a lot of info, it’s important to keep everything organized. WeddingWire’s Wedding Guest List tool helps you do that, and it’s a total sanity-saver. You can even sort your Wedding Guest List by category with one click.

  * ## Hit "send"

When your wedding invites are ready to go, we make it easy to send addresses from your Wedding Guest List. Simply export them and email everything to your invitation provider, and check that task off your to-do list.
