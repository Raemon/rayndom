Beautiful and affordable

I’m so glad we ultimately ended up going with love and letterpress. They were a lot more affordable than the other companies we were considering. Our invitations were such high quality and absolutely beautiful! There was great communication too. I was thoroughly impressed. Would definitely recommend.

I recently used this wedding invitation site and had a wonderful experience! The budget was very reasonable, and the quality exceeded my expectations. Everyone I interacted with was incredibly professional, attentive, and helpful throughout the entire process. They made everything easy and stress-free, which was such a relief during wedding planning. I highly recommend their services to anyone looking for beautiful invitations and great customer care! 💍✨

Amazing Product and Customer Service

Couldn’t be happier with Love & letterpress. Looking back I am very glad we trusted them for many of our paper good needs. The invitations were beautiful, and we received compliments about them and a few other paper goods we had received from them. 10/10, definitely would recommend!
