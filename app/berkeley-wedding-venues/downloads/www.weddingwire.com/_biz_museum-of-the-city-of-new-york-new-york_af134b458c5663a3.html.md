## About

Located at the top Fifth Avenue's iconic Museum Mile and directly across from Central Park’s Conservatory Gardens, the Museum of the City of New York boasts newly restored and renovated spaces that are perfect for every type of social gathering—weddings, bar and bat mitzvahs, engagement parties and more.

There are beautiful and useful spaces throughout the Museum’s elegant landmark building as well as terraces facing Central Park. Guests entering the Museum from Fifth Avenue step into the beautiful Rotunda, the highlight of our grand Georgian-style mansion featuring a sweeping marble staircase and the striking contemporary light sculpture, Starlight. The stunning marble staircase leads to the second floor where the Marble Court, complete with French doors, overlooks Central Park. The 5th Ave Terrace and South Terrace are a rarity in New York City - an elevated and private terrace. Both are delightful in the summer months and can be tented in any season.

After the completion of its ten-year, one hundred million dollar upgrade of our venue, the Museum is quickly becoming a highly sought after venue for social occasions, corporate events, non-profit fundraisers, and more.

It's difficult to put into words just how perfect this was. Choosing a museum as our wedding reception venue was the best idea for our wedding. Our guests were able to enjoy the galleries right before cocktail hours, Central Park - right across the street - made for beautiful portraits, the museum itself is such a classic and chic NYC location - it was just perfect ! I am particularly thankful to Francesca, Samantha, and Chantal who were instrumental in helping us plan, execute, and then clean up after our wedding. You are in good hands with these ladies ! I cannot wait to visit the museum again (the best part!) and know that within the amazing structure I can point out where I had my first dance, where we greeted our guests, and just overall where we had a great day. I strongly recommend non-traditional spaces like this one for wedding receptions - you do have do a little more work (renting chairs, glassware, tables, etc.) but the end result is so very worth it !

Working with the team at the Museum of the City of New York was a great experience. They were extremely involved and so responsive- which definitely made the whole planning process a lot less stressful. Having a wedding at a museum and not a typical wedding venue has some added difficulties, but Francesca and her team were so helpful and always were looking for ways to make the planning go as smoothly as possible. From letting us store our favors and decorations in their offices the night before the wedding to opening up galleries as a backup for our first look in case it rained, they really went above and beyond. The venue itself is absolutely stunning and all of my guests were blown away. I think it's safe to say walking down a marble staircase as your aisle is any bride's dream come true. If you are looking for a unique venue this is definitely the place!

I loved Francesca our Director of Event Sales while planning our wedding this spring! She was very communicative, hands-on, and we could not be more pleased with our wedding venue! We had 0 problems at all during the entire process, from touring the venue to landing the contract, to the day of. It was a perfect experience. The museum is gorgeous and we were able to reserve other rooms not typically included based on our needs without a problem. The museum does have other requirements that make sense in context like no open flames, security concerns, etc but they were not really issues. However, I had to remove a half point just in comparison to naked venues that allow you to bring in whatever and do whatever you want in the space. Overall, I think choosing MCNY was the best decision we made during the entire process!

MCNY was the perfect venue for our winter wedding ceremony and reception. From the moment I walked in and saw their incredible rotunda and staircase, I knew this wasn't like any other venue we looked at. You don't need to do anything at all to make MCNY look gorgeous and elegant. The location was easy for guests and right across the street from the Central Park Conservatory Garden for (snowy!) photos. Francesca and Samantha were easy to work with, and at least from my perspective, our other vendors didn't have any issues in the space. I was also happy to introduce many of my guests to this great museum and for them to have the chance to explore NYC history at our wedding. Just got our photos back and reliving the day at MCNY all over.

When we found MCNY we thought we hit the jackpot. However between the time we booked this location and our wedding date the Events Director had changed. Responsiveness was a huge issues in the last few months leading up to our wedding. Additionally the museum is undergoing construction. If you consider this location I would highly encourage you to have an in depth conversation about what phase of construction they are in. We thought we had and in the end there were still some changes that were communicated too late (after invitations were sent out) for us to change locations.
