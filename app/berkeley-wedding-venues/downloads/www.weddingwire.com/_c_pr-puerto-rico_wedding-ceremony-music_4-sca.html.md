We had a truly fantastic experience from start to finish. Juan Carlos worked closely with us to tailor every detail exactly to our vision, and the custom music arrangements he created for our ceremony were absolutely incredible. The three-piece band brought an amazing vibe to both our ceremony and cocktail hour, setting the perfect tone. During the reception, the DJ did an outstanding job mixing a wide range of genres to keep a very diverse crowd happy and dancing all night—our party was unforgettable. Most importantly, as a queer couple, everyone we worked with made us feel genuinely celebrated, respected, and affirmed. We couldn’t recommend them more highly.

I had a Live Karaoke Band for my 40th birthday party!! They made sure every guest was on time and in tune!! Their repertoire includes everything from Handel to el BadBo, from Bossa Nova to Metal down to every note of every solo. Was every birthday guest in tempo? Absolutely not! But they knew where in the song you were, where *they* were and how to kindly take you there. Out of tune? That's ok, Cuerdas a la N makes you sound amazing no matter what key you believe you're in. I love them! And if I could, I'd have them every year for my birthday. OMG did I tell you it was a full band?! Drums, bass, piano/keyboard, cello and violin. But you can totally book just a duet if that's your style!

Kutasha was recommended by our wedding planner, Denise De Quevedo from Magnolia Productions. All communication with Kutasha was via e-mail. She was very professional and incredibly flexible. She offered suggestions as well as provided demos for specific requests. From day 1 everything was a smooth transaction. I finally met her the day of the wedding. She looked great and sounded amazing! Her suggestions were all very appropriate and the sound was just absolutely outstanding. Everyone enjoyed the music and at the end as we were taking portraits we heard her singing! She has a beautiful voice. The violin/cello duo was great and her music talent definitely set the right mood. Thank you so much Kutasha!
