We had our wedding here and it was PERFECT! The space was the perfect size to have both the wedding and the reception at the same location. Hosts are kind, accommodating and made sure everything was exactly the way we wanted it. There isn’t a single thing I would have changed.

This venue was absolutely amazing!!!! Definitely get married here. They made our day so special. They went above and beyond to make sure we had our ceremony outside after rain most of the day. Thank you so much we couldn't have ask for a better experience.

We had our daughter's wedding here in November and it was STUNNING! Lillian, the wedding coordinator, is an absolute gem!From our very first meeting through the entire wedding evening, her attention to detail was unmatched. She has a way of guiding you through every step of the planning process without ever making you feel stressed, unprepared, or overwhelmed. Her kind and professional demeanor makes her so easy to be around, and she quickly became more than just our coordinator—she became a dear friend.Lillian was incredibly accommodating, always scheduling meetings around the Bride, Mother of the Bride, and even the Groom’s schedules. She kept a detailed book with every piece of information about our event and personally contacted each vendor to confirm details on our behalf. The countless hours she invested into making our day perfect showed her true dedication and passion.Booking Lillian was by far the best investment we made for the entire wedding. If you’re considering a coordinator, look no further—you will absolutely love her!

I absolutely loved my experience with the Windmill Winery and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking! I got married at the Windmill Winery in June 2023. It was the most beautiful wedding. We got the whole package except for the flowers and were married in the lake house. The venue is beautiful! We loved the dock and the reception area. Coming out of the big metal doors was such a thrill! I can't say enough how happy I was with how beautiful our venue was. The bridal cottage was a great place for getting ready pictures. When I first toured the the Windmill Winer I loved the venue but I was nervous about where to take pictures after the ceremony and not just have desert. There was plenty of green around and our pictures were beautiful! It was so much fun to take pictures with the vintage car too! On top of this, all of our vendors were amazing! Our food was unbelievable and our biggest regret of the night was not taking some to-go to the hotel! Our DJs were so helpful and calming during the planning. My husband and I are not even a cake people and we thought the cake was delicious! Tana was so sweet to us throughout planning and the day. We loved loved loved our wedding day.

I'm so glad that I found this smaller venue after days and days of searching online! The people at The Cottage genuinely care about making your wedding day come true (and believe that you don't have to break the bank to have a beautiful wedding day!) They're constantly offering deals and specials, additionally the staff are so flexible and accommodating, they truly care about what you want and aren't just trying to push the most expensive option. On the day of our March wedding, there was not a single thing that I had to worry about (as a Type A bride!) The knowledgeable staff took care of everything. Many of our guests still continue to compliment our wedding, saying that everything ran smoothly and that they felt well taken care of and could tell that the venue was a well oiled machine. I'm truly so thankful for Dina, Destiny and the others at The Cottage for giving us such a beautiful day!

Absolute BEST venue ever!! We did a destination wedding here, we live across the country, and everything was perfect. From the planning to the execution, the team was so supportive and the setting was absolutely gorgeous. The food was so delicious too! Our guests are still talking about the ranch and the wedding, over 6 months later. Thank you to Giovanna, Sarah, and the entire team for making the weekend so special, and for making our dreams come true!

We held our wedding at The Paseo on February 1, 2025 and had the most incredible experience. From day 1, the team at The Paseo was attentive and very quick to answer any and all of our questions. As the time got closer to our wedding date, we were assigned Danielle Applebach as our Event Director and she blew all expectations out of the water. She was so kind, professional, attentive, and very thoughtful regarding our vision for our big day. I am so happy she was assigned to our wedding and she truly made it so special for us. The venue on the day of spoke for itself. Our guests were in awe of how gorgeous The Paseo is and the location of the venue. All in all, we still talk about how the decision to get married at The Paseo was the best decision we made!! We would recommend to every one getting married in Arizona.

The Venue at Chilleens was the perfect choice for our wedding day. From the moment we first reached out, their communication was prompt, clear, friendly, knowledgeable, and caring. The venue itself is incredibly romantic, photogenic, and has a wonderful rustic charm. On the day of our wedding, the staff was so kind and welcoming, and they made everything seamless and smooth - from the custom letter board with our wedding date and new last name, to the set up and breakdown. The all-inclusive package was great value, with amazing vendors and delicious food. I have nothing but the best things to say about The Venue at Chilleens, and would highly recommend them to any couple planning their special day.
