First of all Wautoma Rental went out of their way to be helpful,professional and always happy to see me even with changes. They team showed up right on time and quickly got our tent up. I suggest the 40x100 even if you are not filling it max as you could have the wedding in there should it rain. Amanda our event planner even came out to check and make sure that everything was the way we wanted it. I just couldn't be happier.We will be having a wedding again next August and wouldn't consider going anywhere else. Thank you! Kuckuk Farm

WOW, WOW, WOW...Now this is a vendor I would give 10 stars to if possible! We must use this phrase: “Look no further” – Blue Moon Event Rentals delivered in SO many ways. Jack, Brooke, and Amanda are incredibly fun, personable people with a very strong work ethic! So very accommodating, especially when it comes to ensuring your vision is met, plus more! Jack nailed a vision I didn’t have quite put together during the planning process, and without his expertise and input, I would have been lost. Blue Moon Event Rentals is family-owned, and to see them work tirelessly as a team, AND late nights was truly impressive. It was no small feat to complete the full picture; our Reception consisted of 450 people, in an (obviously) huge venue (with a patio with walkway) at Chula Vista Resort. We cannot thank them enough, and look forward to many ping pong and bags challenges (wink). Thank you!

We had chairs for our wedding and they helped us set up and pick up the chairs. They were busy and hard to get a hold of but when we did questioned were answered.

If you need rentals for you wedding, look no further than Event Essentials. We had no idea how to plan a wedding, nor any comprehension of how stressful it would end up being. No matter how chaotic and overwhelmed we felt, Jackie was there with us through every step of the way. Over hundreds of back-and-forth emails, phone calls and zoom-calls, Jackie's patience and kindness helped us problem-solve and create the event that we always dreamed of. Thank you for making our wedding celebrations possible.

We worked with MB’s for our wedding and are so glad that we did! Although we had some sizing issues when the suits arrived, they were resolved quickly and efficiently. We appreciated the flexibility in choosing between buying and renting options.
