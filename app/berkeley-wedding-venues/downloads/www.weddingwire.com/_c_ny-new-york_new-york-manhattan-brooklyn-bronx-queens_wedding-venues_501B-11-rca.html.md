3 West Club was the absolute perfect wedding venue, we could not be happier with our experience. The venue itself is beautiful, especially near the holiday season and really embodies the “old New York” feel. The people who work at 3 West Club are all incredible and extremely nice, friendly and patient. Tony at the front desk greeted all our guests with kindness and helped make their experience at the venue and their hotel rooms easy for all the out of town guests. Rachel, the venue coordinator was extremely patient with us with all our questions and helped keep things organized and helped set up the space perfectly. The staff who worked the wedding were extremely professional and made our guests feel special. Also, a special thank you to Angela who made sure the bride and groom was comfortable, fed and hydrated the entire wedding. Every room of this venue seems to have its own story and having our wedding here made us feel like we were part of history. We received so many compliments from our guests about how beautiful the space was, the convenience of the location and the beauty of its surroundings, including the incredible view of St. Patrick’s cathedral. My photographers and videographer also loved the space for the amount of photo opportunities. I would highly recommend this venue to everyone and I cannot wait to come back every anniversary and stay at the hotel.

We traveled all the way from Miami to celebrate our wedding at The Ribbon, and it truly could not have been more perfect. From the moment we inquired to the very last minute of our celebration, we felt supported, valued, and genuinely cared for. From the owners and managers to our incredible event planner Heather and the warm, attentive servers and bartenders, every single person on the team exceeded our expectations. They made the entire planning process easy, seamless, and actually enjoyable, which is something every couple dreams of but doesn’t always get. The décor was absolutely stunning, the ambiance felt intimate and elegant, and the food… unbelievable. Our guests are still raving about the flavors, the presentation, and the overall dining experience. The level of service and hospitality was unmatched. Every member of the staff went above and beyond to anticipate our needs, accommodate our wishes, and make sure the night ran flawlessly. What stood out the most was how personal the entire experience felt. We never felt like “just another event.” Instead, we felt like a priority, like the team truly cared about making our wedding special. And they delivered on every single detail. Our guests left feeling taken care of, welcomed, and impressed. We left feeling grateful beyond words. Thank you, The Ribbon, for creating a warm, elegant, and unforgettable celebration. You helped make our wedding weekend magical, and we will cherish it forever.

What we loved: \+ Beautiful interiors. We wanted a red and gold themed Chinese wedding, and the Ballroom was able to deliver plenty of the gold! The ornate columns made us feel like royals. As one of our guests pointed out, the Western style of the venue's interior blended well with our Chinese decorations, and we loved how the end result seemed to capture our personal identities. Also, the Ladies Tea Room is stunning, though unfortunately we weren't able to find a use for the space in our wedding. \+ Great cause. PGB is run by the non-profit Breaking Ground. Weddings are not cheap, so we loved knowing that our money was going to a good cause \+ Convenient location. Easily accessible by multiple subway lines and a short walk from Penn Station, this venue was easy for our guests to get to. We also loved that it was near Madison Square Park, which ended up being the perfect place to do our first look and take pre-ceremony photos with our wedding party. The day before our wedding, we had our wedding rehearsal at PGB and then walked to the Eataly rooftop for a very romantic rehearsal dinner. \+ Easy to work with. We had no problem scheduling multiple walk-throughs of the space with all our vendors (including the night before our wedding, even though there was a high school prom about to happen!). My husband and I both work late hours, but Serena especially was always available to meet with us on weekday evenings, and she was incredibly sweet and helpful every time. Karen and Serena were both very present the day of our wedding and into the evening to ensure everything went smoothly -- every time we needed either of them, they were there for us Heads up / advice to other brides: \- A very raw production. What didn't register for us until we got deeper into wedding planning was that Prince George Ballroom really is just a space, and that's it. It has a small kitchen, but no tableware/cookware, limited staff, and no special lighting and sound equipment. Ultimately what we saved on venue fees we spent multiples on in audio/visual set up. We had to put all the nuts and bolts together ourselves, which made for more coordination work on our end than had we gone with a restaurant or hotel venue. On the plus side, this meant we were able to customize a lot more to our specific needs (and ultimately got more elaborate lighting options). And thankfully, the staff at Breaking Ground is great to work with. \- Because there is so much color and detail in the space already, you may feel there are more limited color options for flowers / dresses / tables / other decor. It was hard for us to envision whether things would clash with the room -- we really didn't know until we saw it all come together day of. \- Limited catering options. Breaking Ground requires you to select a caterer from their list of 6 or so exclusive vendors. While they ultimately made an exception for us because we requested ethnic catering, they still required us to use Breaking Ground's bartenders (so our caterer's waitstaff couldn't pour alcohol). \- No natural lighting. There are only two small windows but the way they are situated, you get very little to no natural lighting in this space. That was fine for us for the purposes of dinner and dancing, but it would've been nice to have a more sunlit ceremony. Overall we're thrilled with how our wedding turned out and so grateful to Serena and Karen for all their help!!

We had our wedding at tribeca rooftop and it was wonderful. The staff did a great job guiding us through the planning process, providing lots of easy to follow guides in order to plan our big day and thoughtful suggestions as we were trying to manage our budget. We absolutely loved the staff we worked with. HUGE shout out to Isabel, our day of coordinator, and really helped us think through options to manage our budget, was super present during the whole day, and was a calming presence throughout the planning process. We also loved George, our bridal attendant, who we got to meet during our tasting as well. George was so incredibly prepared the whole day – always had a water bottle in hand to help someone hydrate, tissues the minute someone said their make up was smearing, learned the names of our family members super quick to make logistics and photos super easy. He also took amazing photos (both stylized and candids) of us throughout the day and sent them to us with such a thoughtful note a few days after – he truly went above and beyond to make us feel special and our day stress free. The venue speaks for itself but by just the photos alone its truly beautiful – amazing spaces with great flow and beautiful views. We also LOVED the food and drink. The bartenders really elevated the look of our signature cocktails and did not shy away from heavy pours. The food was absolutely delicious and the chef was even willing to make edits to the menu based on some other things he was testing out the day of our tasting! The only things to be aware of, is that this is a NYC venue and there are challenges that come with the territory – parking isn’t at the venue but its close, so if anyone wants to drive in early and park their car, that’s a logistical detail you need to handle. There’s a getting ready space, which isn’t massive, so you’ll need to get another space fi you have a big crew doing hair and make up. For this venue there’s also the additional cost of the audio visual team, which the staff is super upfront with even on the first tour of the venue. Overall an amazing experience with tribeca rooftop, hoping I get to go back as a guest one day soon!

## Deciding on a Manhattan Wedding Venue

Manhattan is a place known for fashion, elegant parties and a fast-paced lifestyle. Those very reasons are why Manhattan is one of the top places to get married. With tons of wedding locations, finding the perfect wedding venue for you will be a piece of cake ([wedding cake](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/ny-new-york/new-york-manhattan-brooklyn-bronx-queens/wedding-cakes/501B-2-rca.html), that is!).

## Popular Wedding Venues in Manhattan & Prices

If you're looking for a wedding location in the city, some popular Manhattan wedding venues include: lofts/ rooftops, country clubs, studios, ballrooms, and hotels. Manhattan's world famous skyscrapers could be the perfect backdrop if you choose a loft or rooftop wedding venue. Ballroom and hotel wedding venues are great for large weddings and allow for a great deal of creativity to make the space uniquely yours.

If you and your fiancé(e) are going with a nautical theme, take it to the next level by choosing a river cruise ship as your ceremony and reception venue. Your guests can gape in awe at the Manhattan skyline while enjoying wedding festivities. This unique wedding location will have your guests talking about it for years to come!

Not sure if you're ready to try out your sea legs, but still want to a wedding venue that's out of the box? Some other unique venues include a castle, a book store, a zoo, and several museums. Your guests will not only be entertained by the wedding festivities, but with the wedding venue itself!

As far as pricing goes, Manhattan is the most expensive place in the country to get married. But don't let that deter you from finding a stunning wedding venue in Manhattan. The average cost of a wedding in NYC is around $88,176, which is about $59,000 over the national average. Don't worry if your budget doesn't look like the average, though. Every wedding budget is unique and there’s an appropriate venue out there for everyone.

## Travel & Hotel Accommodations

Depending on where your wedding venue is within Manhattan, there are several airports for out-of-town wedding guests to use. The first is LaGuardia Airport, located in Queens. A drive from LaGuardia to Manhattan wedding venues will take about 35-40 minutes, depending on traffic. If your wedding location is closer to the southern tip of Manhattan, out-of-town guests might consider flying into Newark Liberty Airport, which is about a 30-40 minute drive to wedding venues in Manhattan. JFK, located on Long Island, is also an option, but it is farther from wedding venues at the center of the city.

If you aren't planning on booking a hotel as your Manhattan wedding venue, out-of-town guests will need a place to stay. The average cost of a hotel in NYC is about $213/ night. And we know finding an affordable hotel with enough rooms for your guests that's close to your wedding location can be overwhelming. We suggest you look into this [wedding hotel block](https://hotelblocks.weddingwire.com) service. Representatives will find available hotels with enough rooms at a price you can afford!

## Weather Considerations & Your Manhattan Wedding Venue

Here are a few things you should know about the weather when deciding on a Manhattan wedding venue. Manhattan has a humid continental climate with hot summers and cold winters. Due to the high number of large buildings and high levels of energy use, the city itself can have different temperature than the surrounding boroughs. The weather is also affected by the fact that Manhattan is completely surrounded by water.

If you're looking at outdoor wedding venues in Manhattan, we suggest booking in the late spring or early summer before the humidity sets in. The warm season in Manhattan lasts from the beginning of June to the end of September, with the hottest days being at the end of July. Daily summer temperature highs average above 80 degrees. While outdoor wedding locations like rooftops, country clubs, and gardens are stunning, make sure your guests have a way to stay cool, shaded, and hydrated during your Big Day. It's important to note that thunderstorms are also a possibility during the summer, so have a backup plan. The most likely time to experience precipitation is the beginning of April.

The cold season lasts from the beginning of January to the middle of March, with average lows below freezing. Snow can be expected between the end of November and the beginning of April. So if you're planning on taking pictures outdoors or having an open air ceremony, remind your wedding party and guests to dress appropriately for the weather. While we sure hope it doesn’t rain (or snow) on your wedding day, don’t forget to discuss the possibility of inclement weather with your wedding venue in Manhattan.

When you're ready to start your Manhattan wedding venue search, WeddingWire has everything you'll need!
