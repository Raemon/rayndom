Highly recommend Meredith Manor

My husband and I got married at Meredith Manor on 11/14/25. What an incredible experience! We highly recommend Meredith Manor as a wedding venue. From the first time we visited up until our wedding day, we knew we were in great hands. The team at Meredith Manor, especially Frank and Mimi, are so amazing and great to work with. Mimi was incredibly helpful throughout the planning process, and she was always quick to respond. Frank, Mimi, Karen, and the rest of the Meredith Manor staff exceeded our expectations on our wedding day. They allowed us flexibility in determining if we would have our ceremony outside. Karen, the bridal attendant, was extremely attentive while we were getting ready. They even arranged for a smaller cocktail hour for the bridal party so that everyone had a minute to eat something before greeting guests - and as a bride walking into a venue with 155 people, this was extremely appreciated. It gave my husband and I a moment to have a snack and soak in the newly married bliss! Our guests raved about the appetizers and entrees. They particularly loved the mini cheesesteaks on croissants. Several guests noted how well the venue handled allergies and expressed appreciation for this. The staff was attentive to all guest and bridal party needs throughout the night. The venue itself is absolutely stunning both during the day and at night. Even with 155 guests, we did not feel crammed or rushed. Our guests have been reaching out to us with praise for the venue and their staff. We are so glad that we had our wedding at Meredith Manor. It was truly an unforgettable experience, and we are so thankful for all that the staff did for us as we celebrated our big day! Highly HIGHLY recommend getting married here!

The Perfect Rustic Wedding Venue!

We could not have picked a better place to spend our special day than Meredith Manor! From start to finish, everything was absolutely perfect. Frank and Mimi were an absolute dream to work with—so kind, professional, and attentive to every detail. They truly went above and beyond to make our day everything we hoped for and more.  
The entire staff was amazing and made the day run so smoothly. Every moment felt effortless, and we were able to just relax and enjoy every part of our wedding without a single worry.  
And the venue itself? Stunning. If you're looking for that perfect rustic, romantic charm, Meredith Manor is the place to be. The grounds are gorgeous, the atmosphere is warm and welcoming, and it has that magical quality that every couple dreams of.  
If you're even considering this venue—stop looking. You’d be missing out if you didn’t choose Meredith Manor for your big day. We’re so grateful we did!

Meredith Manor's Team goes above and beyond for their couples

We could not have asked for a better and more smooth wedding day, thanks to the wonderful staff at Meredith Manor. Frank, Mimi, and their team are experts in their craft, and we are so appreciative of everything they did for us before and on the day of the wedding. They truly do handle everything for you on the wedding day, and make sure that you have the day that you envisioned (and that you can ENJOY it as much as your guests do! ). The venue is absolutely beautiful, and we are still hearing compliments from our guests over two months later. Thank you for a beautiful day and wonderful memories, MM team!

Couldn't have asked for anything more!

I cannot say enough good things about Meredith Manor. The photos of the venue speak for themselves; it is absolutely stunning. There are plenty of places for guests to hang out, and we received so many compliments on how beautiful the space was. Working with the Meredith Manor team was equally as fantastic. When we met Frank during our tour, I knew we were in good hands. Mimi was incredibly responsive for the year and a half we were planning our wedding; she answered my emails and all my questions within a day of asking. If I had a problem, they had a solution. On the wedding day, the entire MM team did a great job in ensuring the day went smoothly. We decided not to do a first look, and the team was great allowing us to go where we needed for photos, to get ready, etc. and making sure we didn’t cross paths until the ceremony. They helped us set up all decorations so they would be exactly as we envisioned. The team worked well and communicated with all my vendors, despite none of them being on their preferred vendor list. They ensured we stayed on schedule while still allowing us to do the little, non-traditional things that we wanted to do to make our day unique. They are both efficient and accommodating! We did not hire a day of coordinator, and we really didn’t need one with this team. To top it off, our guests really loved the food; they all said they had never had a decently tasting, hot meal at a wedding – Meredith Manor gave them both (the food on the wedding day was actually better than it was at the tasting)! If I could redo the whole wedding day, I would choose Meredith Manor every single time. This venue was worth every dollar we spent on it!

Little girls dream of their perfect day and Meredith Manor delivers it! I could not have asked for a more perfect day, food, service and photo location all in one.

Everything we wanted and more!

From an open house in 2019 to our wedding in November of 2023 Meredith Manor was a dream come true. Mimi made everything incredibly easy to plan and Frank (and my bridal attendant Gabby) were absolute ROCKSTARS the day of. I honestly couldn’t have asked for a more accommodating venue to make sure my vision came to life. I’m in love with our photos and a huge part of that was how beautiful Meredith Manor is. All of our guests continue to rave about the venue, the food, and just how incredible it was overall. I wish I could relive our wedding at Meredith Manor over and over again! Thank you Mimi and Frank for making wedding planning so easy and for providing my husband and I with an absolutely perfect wedding day!

10/28/23 Heck Wedding!

I cannot stress enough how amazing the wedding team is at Meredith Manor. We chose this venue back in early 2022 and when we met with Frank. Frank was absolutely flawless with everything from  
the quick responses to suggestions and ideas. Mimi was absolutely amazing with helping suggest do’s and don’t and creating a seamless and incredible timeline for us. We were able to really enjoy every moment without worries. We cannot thank them enough for every little detail they helped contribute to make our day amazing! We cannot thank you enough! Love The Hecks!

They made the most beautiful day of my life come true!

I could not speak more highly of Meredith Manor. The whole wedding planning process can be a lot but Frank and Mimi made it as smooth as possible! From planning to the execution, I couldn't ask for more. They paid so much attention to detail, not even just for my special day, but everyday with the beautiful grounds they keep. The whole staff was extremely kind and attentive. Not only did they make me feel like royalty that I couldn't even lift a finger, but they treated every guest the same way. The food was amazing and there was tons of it! For the price Meredith Manor offers, you are receiving so so much more with quality and quantity. So many quests complimented saying it was the best food they've ever had at a wedding and I would agree 100%. The drinks were great and the bar tenders did an amazing job at portraying exactly what I had envisioned. I could go on and on about Meredith Manor, in fact tears come to my eyes just thinking about the wonderful day they gave me! Thanks you to everyone at Meredith Manor, you made 10.27.2023 the best day of my life!

Meredith Manor a MUST HAVE Wedding Destination 

Meredith Manor was an incredible location for my husband and I to have our wedding. We grew up in Pottstown and always knew that it existed but never had really looked into it. The venue (new barn) is absolutely breathtaking and the staff makes it all that much better! From the tour with Frank to nailing down logistics with Mimi, every step of the way was so easy and stress-free. They do an amazing job at making sure your day goes as smoothly as possible and help keep things on track! Frank is a man on a mission and my wedding would not have been the same without his constant attention to detail and our needs. Also, shoutout to the day coordinator they gave you (GABBY YOU ROCK), anything I needed she had me from the second I got there to the minute I left. My day was absolutely perfect and they are so to thank!!
