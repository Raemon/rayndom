We gave Juliette what we thought was a mission impossible - prepare a beach vow renewal ceremony with about 6 weeks notice. She delivered and exceeded all our expectations! Everything was perfectly planned and executed! Juliette was a pleasure to work with. She helped us every step of the way, and made wonderful suggestions. She knows the island very well, and knows all the best locations, people, and businesses.

We used Celebrations for our wedding at the Kimpton Seafire, and cannot recommend them enough. Charlotte was our coordinator and was beyond incredible. She provided decor for our rehearsal dinner as well as 90 day coordination services + decor for our wedding day, and was worth her weight in gold. She is incredibly responsive, has established relationships with vendors on the island, and is truly a master at what she does. Additionally, their floral and decor team is incredible as well. They were able to masterfully execute both our minimal Rehearsal Dinner, and our breathtaking Wedding Day. We cannot recommend their team enough! Thank you for all that you do so well.

Kash and her team were such a pleasure to work with. She listened and totally got my vision. We had a destination and for the most part it was easy breezy. The only issue I had was payments. Our only option to pay was through a bank wire that charged $80 each time. We did 4 or 5 transactions and it wasn't convenient at all. Hopefully they can figure out a better way to take payment. Also, the photographer could have been a little more experienced, meaning I was telling her where to take pictures and such. She also has us facing the sun and most of those pictures we're all blinking. I would hire them again!
