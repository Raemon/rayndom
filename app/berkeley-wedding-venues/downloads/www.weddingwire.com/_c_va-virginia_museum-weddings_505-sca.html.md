It’s 52 days later and we (and our guests) are still absolutely gushing over our outdoor, tented reception in the Renaissance Rose Court location at the Norfolk Botanical Gardens; it was the perfect venue for our wedding! Between their phenomenal staff and stunning views, they had it all! We could not have asked for better! They truly make you feel like VIPs throughout the entire process, from beginning to end. During our initial tour of the venue, the NBG team emphasized that they were always happy to answer any email or call that we sent their way (and boy did they mean it), so we knew we were in good hands the day of the wedding! Their level of communication is impeccable and I promise you will be left feeling like they will do anything to help you achieve your perfect wedding day! The NBG team are not only masters in problem solving, but they are also true professionals. They maintained a friendly and approachable demeanor, and helped all our vendors work together to make every small detail look perfect. The NBG team provided many different ideas and suggestions to make sure we could bring our vision to life in the best and most efficient way possible. They asked an abundance of great questions throughout the process to get a feel for what were our absolute “must haves” and even suggested some things we hadn’t thought of. We hosted our ceremony on the brick in front of the fountain at the Renaissance Rose Court location, cocktail hour at the Statuary Vista location, and then the reception was under a dreamy twinkle light tent on the first grassy tier at the Renaissance Rose Court location. Guests were in awe of the view (and we also lucked out with absolutely perfect, albeit slightly hot, weather)! They were also true champions (and professionals) to help our other vendors set up and break down through our outdoor wedding, on July 12th, in Virginia! Working with the staff at the Norfolk Botanical Garden has been an absolute pleasure from first contact until the end of the wedding day (and the next day when we stopped by to pick up a few forgotten items). Their exceptional talent, professionalism, and dedication to their craft makes them a stand out choice in the world of wedding venues! We could not recommend the Norfolk Botanical Gardens enough, and can’t wait to return to celebrate future life moments! It’s definitely well-worth the investment for a beautiful, love-filled weekend! - The Canavoses

My husband and I have been visiting the Chrysler Museum for years. We had one of our first dates there and we’ve had the opportunity to visit with friends and family numerous times. On a given weekend day, if we’re in Norfolk with no set plans, we drop in to see the different permanent and temporary exhibitions. This is our spot; so it was the perfect setting for our marriage celebration. Huber Court is a beautiful ceremony and reception location, and the Ancient Worlds and Porcelain Galleries made for a unique cocktail hour for our guests. We appreciated, too, having wide access to the museum and museum grounds for photographs prior to the ceremony and during the cocktail hour. We were able to take some truly epic photos – just us and with our wedding party, parents, and siblings. We loved it.

If you want a venue that looks beautiful, has super helpful staff, and has the option to explore a museum during your event, look no further than the Mariners' Museum and Park! I had my wedding in late March so I could take photos with the blooming cherry blossom trees and other spring blooms. Despite this location being a museum, they have an amazing park surrounding it. My now-husband and I took a lot of our couple and solo photos outdoors and they are stunning! If you didn't want your wedding to be in the museum, you could have it in the park. If you want the best of both worlds, you can easily have an outdoor ceremony with the reception indoors, and that's what I did. And if it's supposed to rain? The museum's venue coordinators can work with you to create a backup plan in case of bad weather. I lucked out and didn't have any bad weather on my wedding day, but it was really reassuring to know we had the backup plan. A big bonus to having the wedding take place in the museum is you have the option to pay a little extra to keep the museum open after hours! This was an awesome addition to our wedding because it gave our out-of-town or out-of-state guests an opportunity to explore a place they've never been before. It also provided a nice break from the music and dancing for others. I had a lot of people tell me they loved exploring the museum after dinner was over. One big shout out I have to give for this location is that they provide the tables and chairs! AND museum staff sets it up for you ahead of time! I have heard of other venues charging extra for tables/chairs, or they make you set them up yourselves. You don't have to worry about that at all with the Mariners' Museum. They only thing they make you (or your vendors) set up is anything you bring yourself and anything rented. I am very happy with how my wedding turned out at the Mariners' Museum!

Unfortunately our wedding day was rather cold, so we had to change from using the Navy airplane hanger to the heated second floor. Mitch (the director) was always available and responsive to last minute questions and changes. We did take some pictures afterwards in the Navy hanger.

We used the Montpelier Center as the reception venue for our New Years Eve wedding. This venue may be a little bit of a drive for some, but the overall environmental aesthetics, affordability, and their willingness to accommodate your event needs makes it all well worth the drive. When we first went to the Montpelier Center to discuss our [we thought at the time] somewhat crazy idea of having a NYE wedding, they were nothing but excited at this potential wedding event. Theresa, the current events coordinator, was flexible and revised the traditional event contract to allow us to continue our reception past the typical "must leave by" time due to it being NYE. Also, they accommodated our decorating needs to allow us to start setting up the space two days before the event! Now of course, depending on the time of year and day of your reception, you may not be able to get the same accommodations we received, but I share this to demonstrate just how friendly and responsive Theresa is to try to ensure that the space meets your event and set-up needs. It's beautiful, affordable, flexible, and is just lovely overall. We took all first look and wedding party pictures outside the center (where in warmer weather you could have your ceremony) before our church ceremony not far away, and they turned out beautifully. I highly recommend this venue.

Albert from ArtWorks has been so lovely to work with throughout our wedding planning process. When we made the decision to move our reception due to COVID-19, he was so accommodating and helpful. We are grateful and can't wait for our celebration at ArtWorks in May 2021!

My husband and I took one of our first vacations together to Richmond, VA and went to the Poe Museum on a whim. We both love Poe's work and had never been. As soon as I stepped into the Garden, I knew that this was where I was going to get married. We booked them for a Halloween wedding with an original guest count of 75. With COVID, we wound up having just over 50. The space was beautiful, Debbie was helpful beyond measure, and the entire staff was welcoming. The space itself is gorgeous and perfect for a small, quirky wedding. I do not suggest it for larger than 50 or 60 if you plan to have the ENTIRE wedding there (with the reception). That said, we also did not have the space for a dance floor because we didn't want one. Then again we had a photobooth. You could make it work if you were dead set on a dancing space. The price is also unbeatable. This place seems like an odd wedding venue but for those that love quirk, history, and everything romantically macabre, I promise it is perfect.

My husband and I were over the moon at how beautiful our wedding at the Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art was. From our first tour to our actual ceremony and reception, we couldn’t have been happier with our partnership with Tess who was always there to offer ideas and answer any questions we might have. It truly felt as though both us as a couple and our ideas were truly cared for whenever we had any interaction with Tess. MOCA was not only within our budget, but also featured many amenities other places we toured did not. We were so pleased that our guests were even able to have access to the gallery and see the wonderful local art. From our ceremony in the Rodriguez Pavilion with the beautiful Chihuly sculpture, to our reception in the Atrium with the gorgeous uplighting, lit trees, and reflective floor, our wedding was everything we dreamed it would be, and we are so grateful to have had an opportunity to have it at MOCA and to work with Tess.

The location was amazing and Elizabeth was very helpful with many parts of making things perfect. The grounds and building for the reception were great. Can't say enough thanks to them for letting us have our wedding there
