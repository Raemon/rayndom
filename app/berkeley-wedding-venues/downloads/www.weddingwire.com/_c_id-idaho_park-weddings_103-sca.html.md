We had the absolute best wedding day and I couldn't imagine getting married anywhere else but Fourth Street Gardens! Shelby and Nick are so easy to work with and the venue is such a hidden gem (for now)! I couldn't recommend this venue enough!

My husband and I were married at Camp Alice Pittenger in September of 2017. The Property Manager and Site Manager were helpful when questions were asked. The new shower house was great for our guests who stayed on site who aren't into camping as much as we are. The weekend was supposed to be a bit warmer than what we actually got, but the cabins with heaters were very warm. The lodge can hold about 100 people with tables and a DJ set up, but you will need to break at least two tables down for a dance floor. There is plenty of space to have tables set up outside instead of having your reception indoors. The ceremony area is gorgeous and located right on Payette Lake. The lodge has a commercial grade kitchen. There is also a bunkhouse/house that is perfect for the bride and bridesmaids to get ready in.

Three Peaks lodge is a fantastic venue. Multifunctional because not only is it a beautiful wedding/party venue it can also double as a great place for guests to stay before or after the wedding! We got the package that included the planners, Donna and Lacey! They are incredible to work with and make planning a wedding almost completely stress free! Loved this venue and the wedding we were able to have despite the circumstances of COVID.
