Michael's at Shoreline was my June 29th, 2012 wedding reception venue and the groom & I would not have chosen any other place to trust in!   
  
The restaurant offers different packages to include the meals, flowers, cake, unlimited water & punch, coffee service, & waiting service.  
  
I met with Carol the event coordinator many times over a span of one year and each time she continued to amaze me. We chose to have a plated dinner of Filet Mignon w/stuffed Prawns, Chicken Florentine, Salmon Picatta, & Spinach and Cheese Tortellini (vegetarian) for my 130+ guest party. In addition, I asked if it was possible to personalize the color of the flowers and dinner napkins to match our wedding colors and she was willing to make the arrangements to do so. Carol was very straight forward with the pricing of everything and very flexible with the payment plan. She made the process of planning the reception a complete breeze.   
  
On the day of the wedding, Carol communicated with all our vendors and us effectively & efficiently to make sure everything went smooth & stress free. Carol and her team helped my family set up the extra details around the space. She constantly checked on us throughout the event & even helped me with my wedding dress train when I needed to take photos around the venue. Carol is truly an overall amazing coordinator and person! We are so grateful to have been able to work with her and the team!  
  
Also, during the event, our waiter was Abel and he was such a sweetheart! He took care of the groom and I as well as our families really well!
