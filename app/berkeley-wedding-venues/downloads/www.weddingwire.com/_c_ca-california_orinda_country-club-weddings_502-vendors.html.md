4.8 

An excellent location for weddings and/or bigger parties. You get a brilliant event manager (Celena), who cares about your party and makes almost everything possible. Friendly service staff, good food, great views of the Orinda hills, and a sublime 1920s building. We would definitely choose the Orinda Country Club again for our celebration.
