From start to finish working with Eder was wonderful. He did all of the flowers for my wedding and aside from how absolutely stunning all of the floral arrangements turned out the best part was how much he worked with me. I changed my mind more than once and he was happy to accommodate. He found all of the flowers I asked for and spent hours perfectly placing them. Not only was I blown away but so were my guests. He really made my wedding spectacular.

I cannot say enough wonderful things about Cherry Blossom and the incredible team led by Sandra. From start to finish, they were an absolute dream to work with. First and foremost—the flowers were stunning. Their floral designs are not only beautiful but thoughtfully tailored to reflect your unique wedding vision. Sandra and her team worked so hard to bring ours to life, and it truly showed in every arrangement. What really set them apart, though, was their responsiveness. Out of all the vendors we worked with, Cherry Blossom was by far the quickest to reply—something that meant the world to me during the often hectic planning process. Their communication is top-notch, and their collaborative, creative process made me feel involved, inspired, and completely supported every step of the way. Another huge plus: their pricing is refreshingly fair. Compared to other floral vendors, their costs are more competitive without ever sacrificing quality. With Cherry Blossom, you get gorgeous flowers, exceptional service, and a truly warm, personal vendor relationship—all for a reasonable price. What more could you ask for? But most of all, what stood out to me was how much Sandra genuinely cared. I don’t know how she manages to make every bride feel so special, but I truly felt seen, valued, and supported by her throughout. She poured her heart into our day, and it showed. Our guests are still raving about the flowers! I will forever be grateful to Cherry Blossom for making our wedding feel so magical.

Sebastian and his team really saved me and husband during this process. We found flowers quote to be one of the most expensive costs when getting married in Cancun (and we thought that wouldn’t be the case because it is so tropical). Sebastian worked incredibly hard to work within our budget. He went above and beyond to help us achieve our wedding aesthetic. You will not be disappointed if you work with him and this company. They think of everything and they are the absolute best!

Laura of Macadamia Flores was my favorite vendor for our Mexico City wedding. She brought our ideas and vision to life and I gasped when we walked into the venue. She was extremely professional, kind, responsive, and efficient. Laura is a true artist, with incredible creativity and experience in the industry. Our flowers were beyond my wildest dreams. It also helped that she is bilingual so I was able to communicate with her in English and my mother-in-law in Spanish (my husband is Mexican). I would highly recommend Macadamia Flores to any couples!!!

Francine was a pleasure to work with from start to finish. We traveled to Cabo a year before the wedding to meet with vendors and get as much booked as we could and Francine came to meet us at our venue and sat with us over coffee (and cake as the company is Cabo Flowers and Cakes and her partner Donna does AMAZING wedding cakes!!) and discussed all of the details and what we wanted for the wedding. I had photos and specific ideas and I couldn't have been happier with the result. Francine delivered EXACTLY what we had asked for, and even accommodated a last minute addition (the DAY BEFORE THE WEDDING!) when my hair stylist decided I needed different flowers for my hair during my hair and make up trial. I contacted a few different florists in Cabo and none of them were as helpful, polite, responsive, and downright perfect as Francine. For a Cabo wedding, Cabo Flowers is the only way to go!

Susana and the team at Floreria Zazil were an absolute pleasure to work with. She responds in a timely manner and with any little request or question that we had, she was able to accommodate us. I loved that she had payment plans available and their prices are great. She would send examples of the flowers available, customize arrangements to your needs and she is very organized! Now the flowers, THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL! The floral arrangements for the centerpieces, my bridesmaids, and my sweetheart's table, were gorgeous! The resort we got married at offered a complimentary bridal bouquet, but I wish I would have gotten my bridal bouquet from Floreria Zazil. Regardless, if you're a destination bride, hire them! You'll be less stressed knowing you can rely on this floral team. I would book Floreria Zazil again in a heartbeat.

Moni Junco is a floral genius. We met with several florists and none showed the passion and attention to detail that she did. Moni will be there with you from first meeting until the wedding day, where as many of the florists we met with seemed like big corporate-like teams that pump out weddings like its a factory line. She listened to my vision and what I wanted and created something outside of my imagination.
