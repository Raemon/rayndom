Carlos & Barbara 

We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect wedding day! ✨ From start to finish, Wedgewood Weddings Boulder Ridge made our dream come true. The planning process was smooth and so well-organized—every instruction was easy to follow and gave us peace of mind leading up to the big day.  
  
On the wedding day itself, everything flowed seamlessly thanks to the incredible support of Emily and Nicole. They anticipated our needs before we even had to ask and handled every detail with such professionalism and care. Because of their hard work, our day went off without a hitch and was everything we had imagined and so much more.  
  
Thank you to the entire team for making our wedding truly unforgettable. We’ll forever be grateful! 💍❤️

We love Boulder Ridge!

My husband and I could not have been more pleased with the staff at Boulder ridge. From the beginning of the planning process they were on top of everything. Since my husband and I are not local to San Jose, we were really stressed about wedding planning, but the Boulder Ridge team helped us through the processes seamlessly. Their wedding planning program is a well-oiled machine, and I highly recommend it for couples like us who need more support in the planning process! (all of their vendors are already so wonderful!)   
  
The day of could not have been more perfect. I want to specifically call out our coordinator Kelli and banquet captain Emily. They were absolutely amazing on the wedding day. Throughout the night, they always made sure we were taken care of, often popping by with drinks/food/desserts to make sure we didn’t miss out on eating and hydrating. Even our guests were impressed with their service, many remarked on how happy they were to see us eating so much (which sadly doesn’t seem to happen for couples on their wedding day!)   
  
Shout out also to Melissa who helped us throughout the planning process. She was super attentive to our needs early on and responded so quickly to all our inquiries!   
  
Go with Boulder ridge if you want easy access to top notch vendors, a less stressful wedding planning process, and just the opportunity to work with a really kind and wonderful team of people.

Forever Grateful to Wedgewood Weddings!

After our wedding day on July 6th, 2025, we could not be happier and absolutely grateful that we went with Boulder Ridge for our wedding. We were initially skeptical about booking our big day with Wedgewood Weddings as we were taken aback with the pricing for 100 guest. After looking at different independent venues and contractors, we decided to book through Wedgewood Weddings due to all the options that were already included in our package versus having to do all the outreach and booking ourselves. The binder included was very helpful as it provided guidance on picking out our food, invitations, cake, etc. Our coordinator Melissa was very responsive and helpful with all the back and forth emails I had regarding upgrades, pricing and decor questions.   
  
During our wedding, we had 2 coordinators available that made the day go absolutely smoothly. We had set up a point of contact should any concern arise and was pleasantly surprised that she was also not used as they handled everything! I had pre-purchased a lot of my own decor (personal choice) and was so happy with how everything was placed and looked exactly how I had envisioned. I wanted to specifically thank Melissa and Emily as they were not only helpful, but professional and a dream to work with. We had plenty of compliments from family members and friends that they found the overall experience to be extremely well done. Me and my husband will be forever grateful for such an amazing and memorable special day thanks to Wedgewood Weddings!

The perfect option for our wedding day!

I loved working with the Boulder Ridge team for my wedding! From the start Alyssa and Karyn were super responsive to all of the questions that I had. Leading up to the wedding, Melissa did an amazing job helping us iron out all of the final details. The day of the wedding, Melissa, Tiffany and Emily took really good care of us. They were super attentive and on top of everything. I dropped off a bunch of decor for them to setup, so I was super grateful that they were able to take care of those things for me. The food was very good, and our guests complimented the bar staff as well. We loved the wedding cake (we used I Do Wedding Cakes through them), and our DJ (Ryan from La Place Productions). I'm glad we booked an all inclusive venue since they took care of so much. I did have an outside vendor for some of our rentals and they took care of managing the drop off/pick for that, so it was super helpful. Once again, I want to shout out our Banquet Captain, Emily. She was so kind, and on top of things. Ending our night with her was perfect.

Highly recommend!

Boulder Ridge by Wedgewood Wedding was the venue of our dreams! We spent so much time looking for venues and doing research but nothing stuck with us. The moment we set foot at the location, my husband and I looked at each other and were like "yup, this is the one". We had an outdoor wedding and the view is breathtaking. They also have an indoor option, and you can still use the outdoor space. It's set on top of a golf course, overlooking the hills of San Jose.   
  
All the staff at Boulder Ridge were so easy to work with. We had a budget that they helped us meet while still having the wedding of our dreams. The best part is that it is an all inclusive venue. They take care of decorations, food, photo booth, DJ, and provide a day of coordinator. All we had to do is show up. Took a weight off of our shoulders.   
  
I especially have to give a shoutout to Heather and Melody, who were so amazing and friendly and made our life so much easier. They made sure that everything went smoothly the day of our wedding. And it went off without a glitch. We all had a blast and I can't thank them enough. I would highly recommend booking this venue for your occasion.

Perfection!

Grateful for a beautiful wedding day thanks to Heather and all the Boulder Ridge staff. Super responsive and quick to answer any questions we had. Heather went above and beyond the day of our wedding and always made sure we were ok with everything. Sierra was also great to work with and helped us choose a package best suited for us. Couldn’t be anymore grateful!

Excellent service for a day to remember! 

We were looking for venues in the San Jose area for our wedding back in March 2020 and found Wedgewood Weddings Boulder Ridge which had stellar reviews. WW more than lived up to the reviews! We were super happy with WW and all the vendors we were introduced to through them. WW was also super accommodating with us as we had to postpone our wedding twice due to the pandemic. All our guests had a great time at the event and the location was incredible. We highly recommend WW!
