Beautiful location with amazing staff

We cannot say enough about how wonderful our experience was with VisArts. This location is the perfect romantic city loft vibe location without having to go into DC. The artist concourse was perfect for our happy hour, the roof made for some dramatic wedding photos, and the ballroom was warm and inviting. For your guests, this location is central to hotels, metros, after-party bars, and garage parking.   
  
Beyond a beautiful and unique venue, the staff at VisArts 100% makes booking this space a no brainer! From day one Mary and her staff went above and beyond to help us create our ideal wedding reception. When we finally saw the space we were blown away with how much it matched our wedding vision. Honestly, the staff here is fantastic, coordinating seamlessly with all your other vendors, providing excellent guidance, and generally just being amazing people. I am beyond thankful to Mary, who truly helped me stay sane during this process. Her professional experience makes her a ideal event coordinator.   
  
I promise you won’t regret booking your wedding reception at VisArts!

Amazing venue

We were so proud to host our event at VisArts. We were able to have our wedding on the roof, cocktail hour in the concourse, and reception in the Buchanan Room for our 138 person event in late March 2025. Mary was a dream to work with – she is hardworking, incredibly creative, and accommodating. She was onsite all day for our wedding, and even took an 8:30pm call in advance of the day to make sure we felt comfortable and ready. We had a few unique requests for the paper lanterns, uplighting, layout, and vendor delivery that VisArts accommodated and executed seamlessly. I couldn’t recommend this venue more.

I loved my wedding at visarts!

My husband and I got married at VisArts this past Friday (Dec. 20th) and it was a dream! The main reason why we loved VisArts is because of Mary Liniger the event and sales director and her team! They worked extremely well with my event coordinator and vendors team to execute a beautiful and flawless wedding for us. Mary’s communication is great! See clarified anything needed, they also have a preferred vendors list of high rated/recommended vendors including caterers. There are several to choose from in various budgets, which is nice! I mean she and my event coordinator really had the wedding running like a well oiled machine!   
  
The spaces are excellent! My husband and I fell in love with the Buchanan room where we held our ceremony and reception. As soon as we walked it, we just love the floor to ceiling windows that overlooked the town center. It truly matched the vibe of holiday romance we were going for.  
  
They even had a rooftop which we shot some beautiful pictures/video on! During the months with the nice weather you can even have a wedding on there that has beautiful views! They have different art spaces which when able, you can shoot photos in. It was a really unique space and I personally loved it.  
  
Even price wise, VisArts was one of the more affordable options. The space is also naturally nice but also present a lot of opportunities for unique decor and setup. Our holiday romance theme wedding was beautifully decorated! I loved it. We got SOOOOOO many compliments on the space and the decor in the Buchanan room!   
  
The venue is very convenient as it is right in Rockville Towne Center where there is access to several food options, a hotel, garage parking, a CVS, down the street from several other services. My husband and our bridal party stayed a local hotel a few blocks away, making it easy to go back and forth, if need be. But for the guests, just something to be mindful that there is no free parking or on site parking so that can be something they need to prepare for.   
  
Also, there is a “bridal suite” like space on the top floor where you and your bridal party can get ready or keep their things securely. But you do need to make sure to grab Mary or someone one her team to get you to that floor and get to that room. There is a special key needed to get to that floor/open the room as a way to keep your stuff that you bring to the video safe and secure. But just make sure you prepare for that so you aren’t frantically trying to get up there and have no way to. If you have an event coordinator, make sure they let Mary know as well. You or your coordinator should keep in communication with Mary and her team so they know when you need to get up there and you will be good to go. Otherwise they will be making sure your other event needs are being tended to and ran smoothly.   
  
If you are looking for or are open to a non-traditional space for your wedding, anniversary or any other formal event, this would be a great space to consider! Mary Liniger and her team are so professional and so easy to work with. They will work hard to make your wedding dreams come true! Our wedding was beautiful and I could not thank Mary and her team enough for making sure of that.

Beautiful, modern wedding venue with great staff!

VisArts was the venue for our wedding and we could not have been more pleased with our selection. First of all, the site has a beautiful, modern aesthetic. While it was too hot to hold the ceremony on the rooftop in late August, we were still able to take many beautiful photos with the surrounding skyline, and particularly at sunset. The ballroom itself is roomy and the large glass windows allow in lots of sunlight. Second, VisArts provides a lot of decorating options and we were able to decorate with gorgeous paper lanterns, string lights and colored up-lighting. Third, the VisArts staff were extremely responsive, patient and helpful, answering all of our questions, and making the many changes we requested. Danny, who was our primary point of contact, was especially professional, helpful and accommodating. Fourth, VisArts worked smoothly and effortlessly with our other vendors to make sure everything came together smoothly. And finally, VisArt's location in Rockville Town Center, and its proximity to the Cambria hotel was a huge plus to our out-of-town guests, who really appreciated having so many other restaurants and amenities to go to over our wedding weekend. Overall, VisArts was our ideal wedding venue, and we could not be happier with our selection or the service we received! We would definitely recommend VisArts to anyone else looking for a modern wedding venue!

10/10 Highly Recommend

We held our October wedding at VisArts and couldn’t be happier with how it went! It’s such a wonderful venue with a deep connection to the Rockville community.   
  
We held our ceremony on the roof, the cocktail hour in the Artist Concourse, and the reception in the Buchanan Room. Each location was beautiful.   
  
The event coordination staff is fantastic! We worked with Danny, who was communicative, responsive, and guided us along the process. They are a well-oiled machine — they worked well with all of our vendors and made sure that the venue was set up exactly as promised.   
  
Many thanks to Danny, Mary, and all of the amazing VisArts staff!

A wonderful venue and team!

If you’re looking for a beautiful space, a wonderful team, and the perfect location, look no further! We spent so much time searching in and around DC for the right location for our wedding, and VisArts hit the sweet spot - an artistic community space that rivaled the feel of galleries in the city, a rooftop that added an element of freshness, an approachable ballroom space with dramatic floor-to-ceiling windows and flexible layout, and an awesome team to help everything come together. Not to mention how central everything was for our guests with hotels, restaurants, parking, late night bars, and public transportation right at their fingertips. From the very beginning, Mary, Jackie, and their team made us feel like family, going out of their way to ensure we could plan and execute our vision for our the wedding and sticking with us through not one, but two postponements due to COVID. Through it all, they kept our vendor team coordinated and informed, reassured us when we started to get overwhelmed by the whole process, and ultimately delivered on an incredible experience for us and our guests. We’d recommend VisArts in a heartbeat!

Wonderful and unique venue!

We held our pre-wedding event (South Asian Mehndi / Sangeet) at VisArts and loved it! It's a beautiful and unique local venue. Jarred and the team are incredibly flexible, accommodating and professional. We and our guests loved it and we would highly recommend VisArts to friends and family!

Unique venue in the heart of Rockville

We absolutely loved our venue! We were looking for a venue with a rooftop option, that would be convenient for our (non-DC area) family to travel to, for a price tag we could afford. VisArts covers all the bases! Bonus, it is a nonprofit community art center with artist galleries (which can be opened for your guests to enjoy during your event) and fun classes available (in case you’re looking for a wedding party activitiy). Definitely a unique space.  
  
The rooftop offers views of Rockville Town Square, and had plenty of space to host both our ceremony and cocktail hour (we had 70 guests). Our reception was in the Buchanon Room which boasts floor to ceiling windows and a dance floor. The VisArts team is happy to decorate the ceiling in market lights, or twinkle lights, or japanese lanters, or probably whatever you request! All the tables and chairs were included with our rental, including the lounge furniture on the roof for cocktail hour, which was super convenient.   
  
Not to mention the location! With the Cambria hotel just up the street, and all the restaurants and shops in Rockville Town Square, our guests never had to leave the area. Super convenient, and lots of fun.   
  
Mary was our event manager. She was easy to work with, and happy to lend her expertise to answer all the questions I had along the way!  
  
We can’t say enough good things about it. Go with VisArts and you will be in good hands.

As a newly wed LGBTQ couple, VisArts made us feel like family. It is an amazing venue with a style all it’s own! Mary gave us a 2 hour tour of the facility and all of the options they offer. Because of the style, things they offer to the community as a non profit, and the personal attention give to our event... VisArts was the ONLY option for us. Mary truly embraced our vision and brought it to life. As our wedding day drew closer, Mary and her staff were in constant contact to place us at ease. As Hurricane Florence came to try to ruin our big day, Mary was the first to let us know that her and her staff would do everything in their power, to include working around the clock, to make sure our wedding was all we envisioned! She was amazing!

Mary is just the best. VisArts has so many amazing spaces we had our ceremony on the rooftop and the view is just amazing. We used the 2nd Floor for our cocktail hour and it was just the right size to have guest mix and mingle. The Buchanan room is where we had our reception and it was perfect the glass windows, the Chinese lanterns, the votives in the windows. Everyone loved our space and it was so easy to take our pictures in the gallery and in the middle of Rockville town center. Perfect place
