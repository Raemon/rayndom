I hosted an event at my house! The girls were so amazing. The set up was quick and organized. Everyone who attended was so happy with their bracelets.

The BEST permanent jewelry!!

Lindsy was an absolute dream to work with! Not only was she warm, kind and incredibly patient- she was knowledgeable and extremely gentle! She helped me pick out the most perfect ankle bracelet that has been so comfortable to wear, I hardly notice it’s even there! I even trusted her to put a permanent bracelet on my daughter. Highly recommend her!!

Start to Finish Professionalism!

I hired Aurelle Bond for a private event last month. I dealt directly with Lindsy, who was so amazingly communicative during the whole process. I was looking for a unique experience to wow my guests with at our venue. Choosing to go with a permanent jewelry business did not disappoint. The ladies of my event thought it was so fun and classy. Sometimes things like this could come off as a “gimmick”, but I’m fairly certain every single attendee left with one or more pieces of stunning jewelry. They also told us that if for any reason you needed to be replaced within a certain amount of time, but there was a warranty and they would fix it. They had so many unique pieces to choose from and there was something that fit everyone’s personality and style. Personally, I had wanted to get a piece of permanent jewelry for myself for quite some time. One of my friends from the party has also hired this company to now set up as a vendor at her bridal shower and to be honest, I’m excited, because I’d like to get another bracelet. The set up they provide is beautiful and elegant, and they definitely pay attention to detail. I would definitely recommend working with them!
