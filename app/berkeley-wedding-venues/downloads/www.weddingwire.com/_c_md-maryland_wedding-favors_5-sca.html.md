Everyone wants their wedding to be *that* event that their friends and family talk about for years to come- adding Happy Dagger to your day is the way to go! We hired them to tattoo at our wedding reception as a unique favor to our guests. It was a HUGE hit. It’s been almost two years since our wedding and our friends and family still talk about how amazing it was and that they all still love their tattoos. From the initial contact, Happy Dagger was incredibly responsive to our communication and to our needs and wants for this service. They were able to tell us realistically how big or small the designs could be, how detailed they could be and a great estimate on how many guests they’d be able to accommodate in the time frame. They made sure that everything was clear and easy to understand, which in turn, made the day of go smoothly! tThey were clean and safe and they made our guests feel 100% comfortable while getting tattooed! We ended up coming up with two different designs to offer our guests. Happy Dagger did a great job suggesting designs that went with our overall vibe of the wedding. Seriously, I can’t recommend them enough. They were the highlight of the entire reception! They are a sure fire way to add something different to your day that your friends and family will talk about for years to come! 100% recommend!

Desperately seeking wedding favors that were unique, I approached them about creating the couple's original art logo (used for their invitations). Within a very comfortable time frame shop artists created affordable ceramic tile pieces that could be sized and used for magnets, embedding into a mosaic table top, coasters, holiday tree ornaments - whatever I wanted. Each piece was colorized to blend with the wedding motif. More importantly, each one was in and of itself unique and also beautiful.

They did our favors for our wedding on 7/27/18. They were very responsive and helpful. They even dropped our favors by the venue so we didn't have to come and pick them up. PS their tiger butter is to die for!

For almost a decade, I have used Biggs & Featherbelle for several occasions ranging from Christmas gifts to favors for baby and bridal showers. Adding their products to these events brings a fun and fresh perspective on an otherwise commonly traditional approach. Their unique packaging teamed with the natural aspect of the product really gives off a wholesome and welcoming feeling to the day, which is then carried home with the guests as a gift. We recently used Biggs & Featherbelle for bridal shower favors. Their attentiveness to my request and the prompt turnaround of my order was extremely pleasing and pleasantly reassuring amidst the countless amount of work/time that goes into the prep of a wedding. Each favor was presented in a ribbon tied polka-dot (painted) box with a mini soap and a lip balm. We customized the polka-dots on the box to match the colors the bride was using in her wedding. It was a personal touch that made not only the bride happy but it was the hit of the party! I highly recommend Biggs & Featherbelle, it felt good to support handmade products by sisters who obviously put a lot of love and care into every package.

We got our favors from this place. We had a Kosher wedding with a meat dinner, so we could not have any milk chocolate. My husband is a choco-holic so we needed chocolate! This company was so easy to work with, we got a square chocolate with our pictures on them. They were a hit, and tasty too!

I did not get favors from them because I was afraid chocolates would melt during my outdoor daytime wedding, but I did get their chocolates for a part of my wedding ritual. Their specialty is their unusual assortment of chocolates. Personally I love the jasmine truffle and banana crème chocolate. Their bacon bark is surprisingly tasty as well. I would definitely be turning to them anytime when I'm in a need for some fun filled gifts.

We had our Wedding in Elkridge, Maryland. I am from NC and my husband is from the Eastern Shore. We had a NC meets MD kind of wedding. We wanted to show both our cultures and little pieces of what make our homes so special. Part of that was the choice to use Berger's cookies as 1 of our favors. Berger's is made in Baltimore and a MD favorite! We love the cookies and they are my Son's favorite treats. We were able to get their 2 packs for 125 guests, 3 days before the wedding. They were an amazing addition to a great event. Everyone loved them and many looked over the tables for extras. None were left at the end. As a matter of fact, someone even stole mine. LOL Liz and the team at Berger's were a great help and were so nice to work with when ordering our cookies for the wedding. A big Thank you to Berger's cookies for helping make the event special.
