Bobby was amazing! He performed the music and MCing throughout our ceremony and reception, and each part that he had his hand in was so well done. I would highly recommend his services.

If you’re looking for a DJ who gets it look no further than DJ Mike Carcano! He was a total game-changer at our June 21st wedding at Lido House in Newport Beach. From the planning stages to the final song of the night, Mike was on point with every detail. He worked closely with us on our music selections, created a beautiful lighting setup, and added extra touches of décor that really elevated the atmosphere. But the real magic? He jumped on the drums and performed live with our Arabic percussionist — the energy in the room was unreal! Mike found the perfect balance between Diane’s Jordanian background and my Cuban heritage, and he had both families dancing the entire night. People are still telling us how epic the party was and so much of that is thanks to Mike. He’s talented, professional, and just an all-around great guy. We’re officially keeping him in our lives for any future events. Highly, highly recommend!

We loved working with Pete. He was very professional, organized and attentive throughout the entire process. He was great at creating us a timeline for our day which was so helpful to talk through. Day of, he exceeded our expectations with his Dj and MC skills as well as when he played guitar at our cocktail hour. We highly recommend using Pete for your special day!

From my vantage point as an Event Venue Coordinator who observes many celebrations, parties, and weddings, I can testify to the magic of DJ Scott Topper. He is relaxed, abundantly positive, and energetic. He emceed a recent wedding reception at Live Oak UU Congregation in Goleta with professionalism and a good read on the newlyweds and their guests, keeping a well-paced rhythm of reception activities and getting the guests on the dance floor and in a celebratory mood!

We had DJ Gill do our wedding and he did amazing! He executed our vision just how we discussed it! He has great communication as well and made sure he got every detail right that we asked for. He had our guest dancing the entire time until it was time to leave! He was playing all the right music and had our guest hyped up the entire time. I’m so grateful because our guest have been letting us know our wedding was so much fun and that it was the most fun the have had in a while and how the music was so good! DJ’s make or break your wedding and we are so happy we went with DJ Gill from My DJ’s. Make sure to go with DJ Gill for your wedding!! We also had a Photo Booth as well in our package and our guest loved it! Great experience with them!

We hired All the best Tunes for our New Year's Eve party, and we could not be any happier. DJ Doug was energetic and played great music. Our group danced the night away. We will use them again next year! 10 out of 10!

WOW! My husband and I were blown away by DJ Mark Power. Mark DJ'ed our wedding in April 2022 and he was an absolute joy. From our very first phone call, Mark was nothing short of professional. He was responsive and kind throughout the whole process. His playlist builder and online planner were both easy to use- he really made sure that every single song we requested was played! When dinner was running behind, he was super communicative and flexible with me and with the restaurant manager about shifting the timing of toasts and dancing. DJ Mark even busted some moves with our crew on the dance floor! He felt the fun vibes of our group and we LOVED that!! Mark worked with me and my husband to stay for an extra hour and keep the good time rolling. All of our guests loved him and asked us, where did you find this guy?! I found Mark on WeddingWire, and I am SO thankful I did. He truly lives up to all the positive reviews. Goodtime DJs also offer the option to add a photobooth- do it! It's worth every penny. We got to pick from a wide variety of photobooth templates and our guests got to take home a tangible memento from our special day. DJ Mark is a treasure. You can tell he loves what he does and he puts his heart and soul into his work. I 1000% recommend booking DJ Mark Power for your wedding or any event. Thank you, Mark!!

Spencer was fantastic at our wedding at Ardenwood this month! I was drawn to working with Spencer as soon as he presented his planning spreadsheet during our first intro call. I'm already a type-A spreadsheet-obsessed type of bride so to have a DJ already have their own spreadsheet with all of the details outlined and thinking 3 steps ahead, it was a perfect match. With all of the information that we shared, Spencer was able to take that with just about a week of notice (because we were a bit delayed :) ), and executed our entire wedding flawlessly. My biggest priorities for the wedding DJ was keeping the wedding on time and keeping people lit on the dance floor - both of which were achieved. Thank you Spencer!!!

I just wanted to pass along some information about Grand Slam DJ's. They are really an amazing company that takes hosting events to a whole other level. The owner Mike is very professional and helped us plan out our whole wedding with ease. DJ Chuck Macki was the actually DJ for our wedding day and OMG wow he really did such an outstanding job the whole wedding party was practically speechless!! We had mainly a hispanic crowd and he was able to provide all types of necessary Spanish music for us without even giving him a song list. Grand Slam is the only DJ company we will ever book events with moving forward! Of all the vendors we had to hire, I think the DJ was by far our best selection. Again I want to thank Chuck and Grand Slam for making the event incredible I could not have been happier and I would recommend Chuck one hundred times out of a hundred!!! Regards, Daniel and Suzanne Mendez

We had an amazing experience working with Jose, our wedding DJ, and Ashley, the owner of the company. From start to finish, they were incredibly easy to work with, very responsive, and truly took the time to ask all the right questions to ensure our wedding vision came to life. Their professionalism and attention to detail gave us so much confidence going into the big day. Jose absolutely nailed the music—our guests loved the song choices, and the dance floor was packed all night long. Everyone had an incredible time dancing the night away, and we received so many compliments on the music. We couldn’t be happier with our experience and highly recommend Jose, Ashley, and their team to anyone looking for a fun, seamless, and unforgettable wedding celebration.
