Boulder Creek Ranch was the best venue for our wedding on June 7, 2025! We absolutely loved this venue and are so thankful for Coby and his team for all they did on our wedding day to ensure that everything was ready! They took our wedding guests by golf carts up to the ceremony area in order to keep our guests out of mud and water puddles. We greatly appreciated this as we wanted our guests to be happy, safe, and comfortable. Coby also ensured that we had any supplies that were needed and responded quickly to everything! The venue was absolutely beautiful and even with rain the night before the wedding, they ensured that everything looked ready to go on the day of!! As a bride, I highly recommend this venue to others!!😊

The whole experience was fantastic. The pricing was great, the options were open and inclusive, The design team knocked it out of the park. I highly recommend them. I had no idea what to even tell them and they made it beautiful. They were open and communicated quickly with me every time. They were reliable and the whole day was dream come true. I recommend them highly. They are wonderful and will honestly bring your dreams to life.

Our wedding was in March. It ended up very cold but was still beautiful. Great woodworking throughout the buildings. Doesn’t need much decoration because of its character. It’s a little secluded which gives you more privacy. Matt and Becky were great and a pleasure to work with. Thank you!!

Circle S Ranch is a MUST VISIT location!! Whether you are planning a wedding, a family reunion, or just need to get away from the city and breathe in some fresh air! Mary and her crew were beyond hospitable. From day one in our wedding planning adventure to our big day, they made us feel like we were family! Their cozy Inn housed 34 of our immediate family members and wedding party, and there were still beds unused! The beautifully presented meals that this down to earth team prepared for us were absolutely delicious and well planned! We will definitely visit Circle S Ranch again! Might be our anniversary spot!

My husband and I have always dreamed of a rustic wedding without breaking the bank. We had looked at a couple of different venues that were pretty pricey with very few accommodations. When we stumbled upon Ron & Chris's place, we were blown away. It was exactly what we were looking for and working with Ron & Chris was so easy! They were very responsive and helped us in making decisions and what our perfect day was going to look like. They offered a lot of accommodations and bonuses. The two guest houses were perfect for us and our wedding party and friends had a great time. When Chris told us they offer food and we wouldn't have to have it catered in, that is what sold me! The food they served was cooked to perfection, we had two meats, three sides, a dinner roll, and they provided the water and pop. It was extremely affordable and the best food we've ever had at a wedding! They also provided all chairs, tables, and tablecloths for under 200 guests, and they cleaned up the day after our wedding. We had our ceremony up on the hill overlooking the Kansas river and our reception in the barn. It was absolutely the most perfect day we could've asked for!
