My wife and I were married by Ms. Isabel on October 15, 2025. She is a wonderful person who clearly loves what she does. We couldn’t have asked for a better officiant, and we highly recommend her. Thank you Isa!!

Thank you.

Our wedding took over 2 years to prepare. We had many out of town guests and it became a nightmare to coordinate. Isabel was amazing, so sweet and patient. Always ready to help not only as the officiant but in any way she could. I honestly with all my heart recommend Isa.

Our Cozy Wedding

Isabel was absolutely amazing! She guided us through the entire process, helped us with our vows, and made sure every detail was taken care of. She was punctual, organized, and so sweet and kind throughout. Isabel was especially patient with us and let us take all the time we needed for our vows to be perfect. The ceremony was perfect and reflected exactly who we are as a couple. We highly recommend her to anyone looking for a caring, professional officiant! Thank you Isa!!!
