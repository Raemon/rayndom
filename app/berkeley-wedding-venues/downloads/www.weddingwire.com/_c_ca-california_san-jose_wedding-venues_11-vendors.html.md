We were supposed to have our wedding at Cinnabar in September, 2020, which of course had to be canceled due to COVID! So, we contacted Cinnabar to move it back a year to 2021 and they were extremely accommodating. Unfortunately, the wedding in 2021 got canceled due to the delta variant. So then we decided to cancel our wedding altogether and just make it a smaller anniversary celebration of our February 2020 wedding in India (which thankfully happened before COVID started). Cinnabar was extremely supportive throughout all these decision changes. Finally, our anniversary celebration took place last week (Feb, 2022) and it couldn't have gone better!! Bella and Kristy were amazing! They made sure everything was set up the way we wanted it to be. For us, what made Cinnabar stand out from the other venues we visited were... 1) Beautiful location- the drive up to the golf course is sooo extremely scenic and of course the venue is really really pretty. 2) Beautiful reception hall- I mean the reception hall looks beautiful without any decorations, just as is! It is surrounded on two sides with glass doors and windows, which look out to the lush and undulating golf course! 3) Awesome food- the food at Cinnabar is awesome! They have a restaurant onsite for the golf course and we ate there when we went to the venue for the first time. So we knew right off the bat that their food would be good. They do require that the food be catered by them. But trust me, that's a great thing! Our guests were soo happy with the food. When we went for the tasting before our event, we were so happy with all the food that instead of choosing three appetizers from the four we tasted, we decided to keep all four. Same was true for the entrees. We tasted three and were supposed to choose two. Instead we kept all three! 4) Bella and Kristy- awesome event coordinators. They made sure everything was seamless. We didn't have to worry about anything! They helped us choose the really beautiful linens, chargers and napkins. We had wanted blush table cloths with gold napkins. Bella suggested that we change to ivory napkins instead. That was a great choice, because the gold napkins wouldn't look good. Also, they were extremely helpful with our desserts, which were catered by an outside vendor. They made sure the desserts were kept in the fridge and brought them out at the right time to be served to the guests! 5) Bar- there's a bar in the reception hall and we chose to go for the pay by consumption option. So our guests got whatever it is that they wanted, which was great! All in all, this wedding (rather anniversary) venue was just perfect! This is probably one of the best venues in the bay area as far as value for money is concerned.

We were very happy with our experience with the Wedgewood team. Even though you interact with different people every time, they are all experts at weddings and can guide you through the process. They were very responsive and quickly answered all our questions and weird requests. They give you a planning binder and schedule regular checkpoints to ensure you are making progress. Overall, they made the process enjoyable and less stressful.

Great central location, good team for day or and planning up to the wedding day. If you want a venue where you can have options for vendors your hiring this is a good choice. The team day of was assertive on helping it go smooth and the security was awesome to have. The bartenders that came with the venue did such an amazing job keeping up with my guests. That was a huge deal for me as most of my guests were between 30-50 and like to have a good time so I wanted to make sure there was no line at the bar and good drinks being made. It went well and I'm sure happy with how the wddding went. Leanne my planner helped me so much and did such a great job. Couldn't have done it without her as well. Thank you for having us.

My daughter and son in law's wedding parties, family and wedding guests stayed at the Marriott San Jose, and had such a pleasant experience! We worked closely with Alyssa and Gig, who helped coordinate block rooms, day after brunch, welcome bags for the guests upon their arrival, all the way down to having special goodies in the bride and groom's rooms when they first got there. We were warmly greeted by valet and front desk, and everyone was so helpful with the day after brunch in Arcadia! I would definitely recommend this hotel and their fine staff!

As a wedding planning team, we’ve had the pleasure of working with Hayes Mansion across multiple events and service levels, including full planning, partial planning, day-of coordination, and canine coordination. Our experience with Hayes spans weddings, rehearsal dinners and welcome parties, as well as other wedding-related events. Time and time again, the venue has proven to be reliable, flexible, and especially well-suited for Indian and Indian-fusion weddings, which they handle with care and cultural understanding. We worked closely with Mikaela throughout much of the booking and planning process. While there was a period of internal staffing turnover, the Hayes team handled the transition thoughtfully. Jayson, Assistant Director of Events, stepped in seamlessly, promptly answering questions, addressing concerns, and helping move the event confidently across the finish line. Rebekah has also been an incredible partner. As a Sales Coordinator, she is organized, responsive, and truly supportive both during planning and on the wedding day, which makes a huge difference from a planner’s perspective. The service and banquet teams at Hayes are experienced, professional, and dependable. They understand how important a strong banquet captain is and consistently execute major service moments smoothly. We are especially grateful for how everything was set up exactly as planned, while still allowing room for real-time, on-site adjustments. The team follows service plans closely but also knows how to pivot when events naturally evolve, handling each moment with care. Having a hotel on-site is a huge plus. It gives couples a comfortable and convenient place to get ready and creates a seamless experience for guests throughout the wedding weekend. With so many hospitality options available, couples can truly tailor their celebration in a way that feels thoughtful, elevated, and guest-friendly.

La Pastaia is located inside Hotel De Anza. When we looked around for a place for our wedding venue, we looked at several places and this was the best place for the value and setting for our wedding (this includes cake, food, venue, gratuity to the staff, beverages, and an all day changing room next to the reception area). The staff did a tremendous job in providing service and quality of work. The were very responsive before and during our wedding. We did not worry at all before, during and after the reception. The food was excellent down to the imported beer and wine. We choose the seafood buffet. Our guest of 120 were all pleasantly surprised. Thank you to the staff of Hotel De Anza and Marge, the manager of La Pastaia! You all were fabulous!
