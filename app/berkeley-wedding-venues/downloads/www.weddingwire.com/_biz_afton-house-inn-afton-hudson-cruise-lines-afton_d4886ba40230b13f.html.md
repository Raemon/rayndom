Wonderful historic spot for celebrations

We celebrated a milestone birthday here and enjoyed the food, setup, and cooperation of the servers and Event planner Georgene. I would use this again as the historic site was nice and food excellent!

Excellent Customer Service

Georgene went above and beyond to accommodate our needs for our reception. She is easy and fun to work with when planning the details. The catering was delicious; all of our guests loved it. The area is gorgeous and we took some great photos. Definitely would recommend Afton House Inn to anyone!

Wedding on the Afton Princess Private Charter Vessel

We had our wedding aboard the Afton Princess in September and we couldn't be more happy with the day. Our friends and family absolutely loved the venue and the trip up the river. The event staff was particularly helpful as we had several changes we made through out the process. The trip, the staff aboard the boat, the food was all perfect. We had a smaller affair, and for our budget, it seemed as if we should've paid more. My only regret...that we didn't book a longer ride 😊 Thanks again Afton River Cruise!

We had our wedding reception on the Grand Duchess in July 2015. It was absolutely perfect! Our wedding guests are STILL raving about it!  
The food was great, the staff were very professional and helpful, and the atmosphere was amazing.  
In particular, Anne was incredible- she was very helpful, responsive, and really helped bring our vision to life. On the boat, Lynn was wonderful. She made sure all of our guests were well taken care of, especially my husband and I. She really made sure every moment was what we wanted.  
I would highly recommend the Afton-Hudson Cruise Lines, and I know our guests would too!

We had our wedding and reception aboard the Afton Princess and couldn't be happier with our decision. Anne made our planning so easy. She was very helpful with suggestions when we needed to cut a couple costs on the way. The staff on board was very professional and they made our day even more special. I would suggest Afton Cruise's to anyone planning a summer wedding.

We had our reception at the Afton House Inn in the wheel room back in 2012. After eloping we wanted to host a fun reception for friends and family to celebrate our marriage with us. We wanted something affordable yet offered all inclusive services like hall, catering, and hotel all in one. Afton had that. We were pleasantly surprised by the care that went in to the preparation. I would definitely recommend this venue!

We had our ceremony and reception on the afton princess. It was great. Anne met with us several times late in the evening due to our work schedule. She was very accommodating. The wedding went perfect. Lynn the head server and her staff were very kind and helpful. The food was delicious. We received many compliments. Thank you Anne and cruise line staff for making our day PERFECT!

The Afton House Inn provided us the space and ambiance we were looking for to celebrate our marriage. They worked with us through all of our questions, made adjustments and suggestions and worked to make sure that what we expected and hoped for was delivered. As everyone says, the food was amazing-tasted just like it did at the tasting and at subsequent visits to just eat at the restaurant. The service was warm and friendly, our guests really enjoyed the care given to them and their experience over the weekend. I cannot say enough nice things about what the Afton House Inn gave us for the weekend and how much fun we had.

We had our wedding on the Afton Princess and we couldn't have asked for anything more. We loved it! The staff was so great and seemed to really care that us and our guests really enjoyed themselves. Anne was our wedding coordinator and she had so many great ideas and suggestions to help us. She also got back to me very quickly on any question I had, no matter how insignificant it was. We also loved the food! We;re still getting comments from our guests on how good our food was on the boat. We can't wait to go back!

The Afton House is a great place for a Wedding Ceremony and reception. As a retired judge I have performed many marriage ceremonies there. The staff is experienced, friendly and helpful. It's a wonderful choice for your wedding events.
