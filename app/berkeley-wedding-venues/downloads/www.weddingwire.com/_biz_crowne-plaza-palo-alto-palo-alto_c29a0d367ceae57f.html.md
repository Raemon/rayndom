My husband and I had an AMAZING wedding reception experience at the Crowne Plaza Cabana. Hristo did absolutely everything he could to make our day as stress-free and smooth as possible. Throughout the entire planning process, he was always very quick to answer any questions, connect us with vendors, and alleviate any worries. As we got closer to our wedding date, he made sure that we set aside time to go over all the details (from room layout, vendor information, individual guest's special dietary needs, etc). Both the dinner and the morning brunch were delicious. The entire staff was very courteous and welcoming to our guests, which we really appreciated because most of our wedding guests were from out of town. They truly went out of their way by all means possible to ensure that we (as well as our families and guests) had a wonderful wedding experience. We could not have chosen a better venue for our big day!! Thank you so much for everything that you did for us!!

We had our wedding reception here and it was PERFECT!! We had 210 guests in the main ballroom but the facility is very flexible for larger or smaller groups. The catering manager, Marisa, was amazing to work with. She was on it with every detail and very flexible and accommodating to make our reception everything we wanted it to be. She was very sweet, fun and pleasant to work with too. Our group rented 37 rooms for the weekend and everyone had a wonderful stay. The staff at this hotel are very friendly and helpful. We also had a large brunch Sunday morning and John, the restaurant manager went out of his way to make our groups experience great! The food at this hotel is wonderful - the reception banquet and brunch were far above the usual hotel fare. I highly recommend Marisa and her team for any event you are hosting in Palo Alto.

Great venue for a large or small wedding, the courtyard is a great place to have the ceremony (and offers room for imagination and can be used in any way), the ballroom is huge! but can be used in 1-3 pieces by way of air wall and works well, the subtle wall pattern really looked great in the pictures! The staff was easy to work with and really shines in customer service. We had outside catering, so cant really comment on the food, but overall a great venue in the peninsula, convenient and beautiful.

Deciding to have my wedding at the Crowne Plaza Cabaña in Palo Alto, CA, was one of the best decisions I've ever made. The venue is gorgeous, staff excellent, and everything put together helped create a truly magical, memorable day. All of our guests were highly impressed with the wedding and I would do it over again 100x if I could! Thank you especially to Kelsey Krimmer for her expert guidance and support throughout the planning process. Highly recommend!

Pro: Very nice lobby area and club lounge, beautiful courtyard, amazing ballroom (Cyprus room), delicious food and really great catering team  
Con: Lack of privacy in ceremony location (court yard), some guest rooms are below standard and inefficient bell staffs.  
  
Kelsey Krimmer, my sales & catering coordinator, went above and beyond to make my wedding almost perfect! She was very sweet and dedicated and very good communicator. Her exceptional knowledge in wedding planning really helps with the process. Her recommended vendors also work really well together and they came through with beautiful results. We were also able to customized some things that make our wedding really us!   
The wedding overall went great. The food was amazing and the bar and catering staffs did an amazing job with our guests. I had to add one extra guest when the reception start that the staffs handle it perfectly well.  
The court yard ceremony was beautiful but also happens to be next to the pool. My wedding day happened to be really hot and there were little kids screaming in the background. The rest of the day was awesome.   
I planned an offsite photo shoot but had to cancel. We took a lot of pictures around the hotel and from what I have seen, they came out really well!  
The complementary suite was wonderful and complete opposite from the guest rooms in the wings, which were small, dark, smelled like bleach. One of my brother have a room in the tower (only one bed vs. two in the others) and the room was much nicer than the ones I in the wings.   
The suite itself was luxurious and perfect to spend our wedding night. We might be back to celebrate our anniversary.

We are very happy that we held a wedding ceremony and reception at the Cabana Hotel. From the very start, Marissa, our event planner at the hotel, was open to making the plans for our special day a reality. She listened to our needs and helped us design our day within the budget that we had. She told us upfront what the hotel could and could not do and how much everything would cost. During the planning process, we asked Marisa innumerable questions, and although initially her response time was a little slow, possibly because of her being extremely busy, she did eventually get back to us with all the information we needed. As our wedding date got closer, she definitely made us a priority and her response time was almost immediate. On the day of the wedding, Marisa was there every step of the day. She knew the timing of all our events and helped us keep on track. She constantly checked in on us to make sure everything was going well. Her staff, especially Carlos, was also very helpful that day and they really helped make the day a success. Our guests even commented to us how flawlessly the day seemed to go.   
  
The only regret we have is with the dinner options that were served at the reception; they were not exactly what we had asked for. When we went for the tastings, the Chef told that we could make small changes to their standard dishes and could mix and match side dishes. We wanted to do just that and even discussed and confirmed our changes with the chef. He said it would be perfectly fine to accommodate our requests and took detailed notes (which we saw in final paperwork). The day of the wedding, the dishes served were the standard format dishes without any of our requested changes. We believe our guests still enjoyed the food. Nonetheless, Marisa was a joy to work with and was on top of everything the week and day of the wedding. Many thanks to her.

I was honored to be invited to take part in a Wedding Fair Show 2 weeks ago, at the Crown Plaza Cabana Hotel in Palo Alto, Ca. Which I enjoyed very much working on all the new brides to be with Hair & Make-up. Wow what a beautiful Hotel with the Hollywood flair and detail, which in 1962 the movie star Doris Day owned. The wedding fair was a Big hit. Diane did a wonderful job putting it all together. The Cabana Hotel is a stunning place to have a wedding or any special event. I highly recommend the Crown Plaza Cabana Hotel in Palo Alto, Ca. 5 star

My trio entertained at the Crowne Plaza Cabana's wedding fair last Sunday. What a sensational afternoon! Highlights featured a dazzling fashion show and an informative panel discussion about wedding preparations a bride can "do herself". In addition, dozens of top event professionals displayed their services and spoke with guests circulating in the hotel's gorgeous ballroom. It was wonderful to be part of an outstanding showcase and work with the hotel's Catering and Events team, particularly Diana Wittenbrock and Sherleen Eng. Because too many shows at other facilities are so-so these days, this one really stands out. Every presentation was superb, showing what a difference it makes when EVERYONE involved pays special attention to the finest details. My band works at the Crowne Plaza Cabana often, and we've come to expect a flawless celebration every time.
