Rebecca and the rest of the Palais team were absolutely wonderful. The venue was super cozy and lovely for our Fall wedding and we got to take advantage of the amazing patio (with tent). Amazing rope light set up, delicious food, friendly staff. Our guests raved about the experience and we could not be more pleased! The lead up and day of was all super smooth, and we had a a blast

Loved the Carnegie! Owners are super nice and personable. They made the whole process so easy, and there’s many freedoms that other vendors that don’t offer. Such a unique and simply gorgeous space. You walk in and immediately feel a part of something special. The best bridal suite! Best bang for your buck around, hands down!

Our ceremony was held in the Simon Reading Room of the Central Library, downtown Indianapolis. We could not have picked a more gorgeous venue! All of our guests raved about the venue. They could not believe how beautiful everything was. We didn't need any decorations because the room is just so naturally stunning. Jenelle was our coordinator and she was absolutely perfect! Along with our officiant, Janelle helped run the entire rehearsal and the entire ceremony. We would not have had a perfect day without Janelle and the library staff. The professionalism and kindness they showed my husband and I can't be found anywhere else. We are so very grateful and would recommend this venue and their staff to anyone!

We are SO glad that we chose this venue. We didn’t have to decorate the venue much because it’s already so elegant with beautiful art. We had many friends coming all the way from other states, so we didn’t want to make it look too cheap. This venue offers reasonable plan, yet the quality you get is beyond that. Mary was very professional and experienced, and we fully relied on her in coordinating. This venue and Mary made our day very very special and successful. Highly recommended!

Julia was great. The catering staff went out of their way to make sure the guests were happy. The location it’s self is beautiful. We rented the location over night. Everyone who could not drive home or was from out of town had a safe place to sleep. Well worth it.

This is truly a hidden gem in Indianapolis for a wedding and event venue. From the moment I walked in I was blown away by the beauty, layout, woodwork, stained glass windows and ease to hold a big event all in one location. The sanctuary was beautiful and alter was just what I dreamed of for my wedding. Piano on stage, large pipe organ, beautiful layout and lighting makes the space truly special. Then to have options for a reception just around the corner in same building made it easy for guests to enjoy the evening without travel. It was amazing and many of my guests had never been to an event there. They all commented on the space. The Landmarks Center made my day one to remember.

We looked at quite a few venues and just couldn’t find the one. When we walked into VisionLoft, we knew immediately we’d be using the venue. It is stunning and such a great aesthetic inside. Heather was our coordinator and she was fabulous! She made the day run so flawlessly and gave us great suggestions during the planning process. All do the staff at VisionLoft were incredible. Highly recommend!

Historic Saint Joseph Hall was the last venue we toured. We had pretty much already made up our mind about booking another venue, but decided to keep the appointment. We were completely wowed and booked the venue that night. I am so glad we did! While we had some communication struggles throughout the process (the venue was swamped with COVID rescheduling and in the process of hiring additional wedding staff) it had zero impact on the actual wedding day. Adam was very flexible and a great venue and expert for us to lean on. He made our day fantastic. He coordinated with vendors. He made sure everything was perfect. We requested a spicy margarita as our signature drink and he not only made it happen, but it was the star of the wedding. We got so many compliments about it and still get them! When our 8-year-old niece didn't like the dinner options, Adam got her chicken fingers from the restaurant at no cost even though we told him we were happy to pay. The venue is absolutely gorgeous and has so many perks, like the cottage next door and the outdoor terrace - perfect if you're flipping the room. So many compliments about the wedding venue. It was the perfect spot for our day. My biggest complaint is the new person they brought on to assist Adam. I had never met her until our rehearsal as she was recently hired. She wasn't very friendly and it made me wonder why she's working in hospitality. My mother in law asked if we could move the front row of chairs during the ceremony to the back as it was very close to the altar and she was very rude and told us they "didn't do that." Then, a plate sat incorrectly at the wrong table (no big deal) but she argued with my guests that someone was in the wrong spot and made everyone show her the seating chart. I don't know why she didn't just make it work. It was their mistake, but even if it was ours, things happen, why berate the guests? All in all, I would highly recommend this venue. The food was so amazing our guests haven't stopped talking about it! It was beautiful, elegant, and affordable. I can't say enough good things I am so happy this was our venue.
