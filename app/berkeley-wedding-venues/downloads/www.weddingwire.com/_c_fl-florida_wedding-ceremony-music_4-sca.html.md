We wanted to create an unforgettable atmosphere for our guests during our wedding ceremony. After speaking with Esther it was an easy decision to move forward with The Elegant Harp. Esther is professional, knowledgeable and extremely talented. Although she offers a huge selection of songs, she still went above and beyond to learn a special song for our ceremony. We can’t recommend Esther and her team enough!

So thrilled we used String Theory. I loved the idea of keeping it Classic with violin and cello but modern song options. The team was amazing and made the day so special, they are talented professional and highly responsive. There's something magical about walking down the aisle to live music! Allison was so helpful along the way and assisted me in creating a custom song to walk down to. 10/10 no hesitations.

Deron's band was amazing. They showed up early and were very professional, but still had a lot of fun working our wedding. Deron has an amazing ability to do modern songs as well as all the beloved classics like the beatles, bobby darin, and can even figure out an obscure request you have. (My wife requested a different custom rendition of La Vie En Rose, and he nailed it!) He was very flexible with where we had him (both indoor and outdoor) and he worked perfectly with us to make sure everything went to plan the day of. He also did a great job DJing our wedding, and did all the announcements and pacing perfectly. The photo below is of him right before the start of our outdoor ceremony. He showed up to a town and location he never worked before and figured it out, and still had fun as shown in the picture! His personality will mesh well with your wedding, he was really nice, patient, and kind to everyone too. We cannot recommend him enough, and only wish we could have him play more for us. A+++ and you won't regret having him play at your wedding!

Classern String Quartet helped make my wedding dreams come true with their beautiful music during our ceremony and cocktail hour. We had so many compliments on how great they sounded and they played exactly the music we wanted. We couldn't be happier that we hired them for our wedding!

We hired Chris to provide ambient music for our wedding and we were more than pleased with the experience. We were married on the pier at the Hyatt Centric and we asked Chris to learn some pop songs we weren't even sure would sound good played on an acoustic guitar but we were very impressed with the arrangements Chris produced. He even sang a couple of songs which was more than we were expecting. It added that final touch we were looking for to make our wedding perfect. He was timely and professional throughout. We would definitely recommend him for any occasion.

We hired Bob Lyons as our steel drum player and wedding DJ for our May 2025 wedding in Key Largo, and he was absolutely fantastic! His steel drum performance before the ceremony and during our cocktail hour instantly set the perfect island vibe for our guests—it felt like the Keys came alive through his music. When dinner began, Bob seamlessly transitioned into DJ mode, providing the perfect background music to set the tone. He then MC’d our special introductions and first dances with professionalism and great energy. Once the dance floor opened, it stayed packed all night thanks to his DJ skills, fun atmosphere, and mood lighting that really brought the party to life. Bob is incredibly talented, versatile, and easy to work with. If you’re getting married in the Keys—or planning any special event—I highly recommend hiring him. Thank you for everything, Bob, for making our wedding soundtrack absolutely unforgettable!

Lisa was absolutely wonderful at our wedding. She worked beautifully with our harpist, and the two of them coordinated everything perfectly, from the Christian music we wanted for the ceremony to the Disney and miscellaneous pieces for the pre-ceremony. Lisa’s communication was excellent throughout the entire process, and she was so friendly and easy to work with. The music was gorgeous and added so much to our day. We’re so grateful we chose her!

I used master musicians for our micro wedding. We wanted elegant music that contributed to , rather than overpowered our ceremony. Using a violin and cello it was perfect. Their communication was excellent with multiple choices of instruments and and a huge music selection. Choosing which pieces of music was the only difficult part of the whole experience. They helped me make decisions and on the day the atmosphere they provided was perfect! They played on the sand in florida 85+ degree heat and were note perfect, then moved inside for the cocktail hour. They were amazing and I loved having them be an integral part of our special day.
