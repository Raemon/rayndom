Couples setting up their registry often forget to add holiday-focused items. For those who celebrate Jewish holidays such as Hanukkah, unique menorahs should definitely be included on their registry list. However, these special candleholders often look, well, kind of the same, and couples with a distinctive design style may prefer more modern menorahs rather than the more old-school classic varieties. Fortunately, there are lots of options to choose from. We scoured our favorite retailers to find some of the most unique menorahs around, from botanical to colorful and more.

## Minimalist White Menorah

If your taste leans more towards minimalism, this sculptural Hanukkah menorah is worth checking out. The white ceramic piece features a wavy pattern and adds a contemporary touch to your holiday décor.

## Tree of Life Menorah

The mixed materials—wood and stainless steel—on this menorah gives it a unique vibe that suits many decor styles.

## Folding Candleholder Menorah

We absolutely adore this unique menorah, which appears flat, but has folding candleholders which can be displayed on each of the eight nights. It’s made from stainless steel and is crafted in Israel.

**Wallaby by Shelly** modern menorah, $59, [Etsy](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&clickref=WWeditorial&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.etsy.com%252Flisting%252F665107907%252Fhanukkiah-modern-menorah-modern-judaica%5D%5D)

Hanukkah menorahs aren’t usually described as edgy but this Michael Aram design made from black granite and nickel, gives off a sophisticated, fashion-forward vibe.

## Boho Bamboo Menorah

For those who prefer a more boho chic vibe, we love this wooden menorah, designed in the shape of a lotus flower. Made from bamboo, this unique menorah can be easily disassembled and stored flat as a space-saving solution.

**Gio Gio Design** lotus flower menorah, $165, [Etsy](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&clickref=WWeditorial&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.etsy.com%252Flisting%252F482973417%252Flotus-flower-menorah-hanukkah-chanukkah%5D%5D)

## Colorful Bird Menorah

Hanukkah menorahs aren’t usually colorful (unless they’re the kind handcrafted by little kids), but this one is both stylish and adds a pop of hue to your home. The brass piece features a floral design, with a pair of birds to perhaps represent you and your new spouse. 

**Grader Designs** menorah, $175, [Etsy](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&clickref=WWeditorial&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.etsy.com%252Flisting%252F246144385%252Fmenorah-hanukkah-judaica-hand-made-in%5D%5D)

## Travel Menorah

Inspired by Jerusalem’s city walls, this unique menorah is ideal for couples who may be traveling during the Hanukkah holiday. It can fold up to easily stow in a suitcase, and comes in 12 colors.

**Nadav Art** traveling menorah, $120, [Etsy](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&clickref=WWeditorial&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.etsy.com%252Flisting%252F449381502%252Ftraveling-hanukkah-menorah-aluminum%5D%5D)

## Modern Aluminum Menorah

Modern sculptural menorahs really add to your home’s décor—but yes, they can often be pretty pricey. We love this expensive-looking aluminum menorah that costs less than $25.

**Rite Lite** modern aluminum menorah, $24, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JP2IAQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000JP2IAQ&linkCode=as2&tag=weddingwire-generic-20&linkId=96c3972456d91aa41e302b7a8cf3b1b1)

## Contemporary Metal Menorah

## Acrylic Menorah

Add a pop of color to your Judaica with this statement-making acrylic menorah. And this piece actually serves double-duty: By removing the metal cups, you can use it as a flower vase long after Hanukkah is over!

**Apeloig Collection** menorah, $380, [Bloomingdale's](https://www.bloomingdales.com/shop/product/apeloig-collection-menorah?ID=3830858&CategoryID=3865)

## Golden Palm Menorah

Palm motifs are very popular in home décor right now, and this gold-and-marble menorah is totally on trend. Inspired by a fallen palm frond, this unique menorah is definitely a statement piece.

**Michael Aram** Palm menorah, $425, [Macy’s](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/michael-aram-palm-menorah?ID=2290958&CategoryID=22672)

## Wooden Menorah

Midcentury modern décor is all the rage right now, and this handmade wooden menorah totally fits that style. The unique menorah is made from reclaimed walnut, and features nickel candleholders.

**Modern and Mint** menorah, $115, [Etsy](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&clickref=WWeditorial&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.etsy.com%252Flisting%252F737447527%252Fmodern-menorah-mid-century-modern%5D%5D)

## LED Menorah

There are lots of reasons why an electric menorah might be preferred—perhaps you can’t or don’t want to have open flames in your home, or you’d like a unique menorah that will stay lit all night. We like this LED option that comes in four colors. 

**Zion Judaica** LED electric menorah, $50, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LXGIRCN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01LXGIRCN&linkCode=as2&tag=weddingwire-generic-20&linkId=4290da32f165494ee0627f3115f6a230)

## Menorah Cork

Wine lovers will get a kick out of this unique menorah, which attaches to a bottle’s cork. Yes, it’s not your typical menorah but it’s definitely modern, fun—and portable.

## Vine Menorah

Inspired by intertwining vines, this is one of the most unique menorahs we’ve seen. The twisting candleholders provide visual interest, and we love that it’s made from brass—the gold hue stands out from the more classic, silver-toned menorahs we’ve seen. 

**Michael Aram** Wisteria gold brass menorah, $200, [Saks Fifth Avenue](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=9ibcrDa*U1o&mid=13816&u1=WWeditorial&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.saksfifthavenue.com%2Fmichael-aram-wisteria-gold-brass-menorah%2Fproduct%2F0400011152062)
