Fave the Day was one of the absolute highlights of our wedding! We wanted to do something truly unique for our guests, and the custom perfume/cologne roller bottles were a huge success. One of the best parts was that we got to choose the scents ourselves, which made the experience feel even more personal and special. Everyone loved it—our guests are still talking about how fun and thoughtful it was. From start to finish, their customer service was amazing: professional, friendly, and incredibly easy to work with. They helped bring our vision to life and delivered an unforgettable experience that doubled as the perfect wedding favor. If you’re looking for something memorable, interactive, and elegant for your event, we highly recommend Fave the Day. It was truly one of the best decisions we made for our wedding!

Courtney brought us so much joy during our wedding planning process - a time that can, unfortunately, feel overly transactional or even a little predatory. She was the complete opposite of that. Her sticker photo booth was not just a service, but a beautiful, creative experience delivered with so much generosity, intention, and professional finesse. By the end of wedding planning, I was definitely feeling a little withered… and Courtney was such a light. She made the whole experience feel fun again!! Our guests were obsessed with the creative, uniquely designed stickers (which also served as a keepsake). If you want something unique, joyful, and genuinely memorable for your wedding or event - hire Courtney. She’s a gem.

Ms. Leslie created an original oil painting from a photo from our wedding 28 years ago. The painting was an anniversary gift and I couldn’t be more pleased! She worked with me to decide on a moment to preserve, and then helped choose a photo of that moment. Her price was very reasonable and the quality of the painting far exceeded my expectations. Would definitely recommend!!

I had Diana come to my bridal shower to do permanent jewelry and it was honestly one of the best parts of the day! She was so patient, sweet, and such a total professional — everyone felt comfortable and taken care of. She gave me and my guest beautiful pieces and even matching pieces for some, and it made the whole experience feel extra special. The jewelry is stunning, and the whole vibe she brought just added such a fun spark to the day. I’d 100% do this again for another event. it’s such a unique and memorable touch. Thank you so much, Diana for making me feel even more special on my day. Cant wait to do it again. ✨

Smoke N Memories is more than just a cigar business. It’s a community built on respect, gratitude, and shared experiences. From the moment you arrive, Brandon, the host, makes you feel like family. His hospitality, professionalism, and passion for supporting veterans and first responders are unmatched. The cigars are top-tier, offering a smooth and satisfying experience whether you’re a seasoned aficionado or a casual smoker. But what truly sets Smoke N Memories apart are the meet and greet events. They’re not just gatherings, they’re meaningful opportunities to connect, honor service, and unwind with others who understand the unique bond of public service. This is the kind of organization that leaves a lasting impression and keeps you coming back. If you’re looking to enjoy great cigars while supporting a great cause, Smoke N Memories is where you want to be. Highly recommend!

We booked DFW Cigar Roller for our wedding reception and we are so glad we did! We were looking for a unique experience for our guests and they certainly delivered! Our guests loved the cigars and were talking about it for weeks after the wedding! Amazing & professional service that I would recommend to anyone for any event!

We hired Texas Branding Station for a corporate gifting suite and they were amazing. From the initial contact to designing our logo, to running the event, they were extremely professional. And most importantly our guests had the best time making the items!!!

We purchased our welcome bags from Favors You keep and we just loved them! We were able to customize them to our wedding colors, names and wedding date. We received several complements on the bags. The lady that took my order was extremely helpful and friendly. She helped me pick out the best color combination and gave me inside tips as to what fonts would ship faster than others. This was a great help as I was ordering these a bit last minute, and it saved me money on shipping.
