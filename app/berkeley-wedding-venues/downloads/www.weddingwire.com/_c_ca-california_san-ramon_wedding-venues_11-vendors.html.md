My husband and I held our wedding reception at the Bridges Golf Club, the Garden Pavilion room, and we were so delighted at how beautiful everything turned out! We worked with Sharon, who was highly responsive, flexible, and answered our many questions. Sharon was honest and provided great recommendations for the food, table layout, timeline, etc. Her feedback and wonderful communication skills made the wedding planning process so smooth. The wedding day was a breeze. The staff at the Bridges were on top of things and were on schedule. The table settings were beautiful, the staff were kind and professional, and the setting was stunning. Our guests were blown away by the spectacular views of the canyon, and took epic sunset photos. The staff always checked in on my husband and I to ensure we had sufficient food and drinks. Speaking of food, the food was so delicious! With Sharon's recommendation, we selected the prime rib, salmon, and ravioli. The portions were generous, and the guests were very impressed by the quality! We also had an open bar, and everyone enjoyed the quality of the drinks. We would recommend the Bridges without hesitation! Thanks Bridges for making our wedding day so magical.

I want to go back and do it all again. From the planning to the wedding day, everything was perfect. We chose the venue because it was so beautiful, but the team we worked with made the choice the best. Wedgewood Weddings does it all!! We worked with all of their recommended vendors, and they exceeded our expectations. The DJ knows how to get the party started. Our bartender kept the drinks flowing. And our captain kept everything running smoothly. I didn't have to worry about a thing. I am so happy we chose San Ramon Waters, I would make the decision again if I could.

My wife and I hosted our wedding at Little Hills and it was a really great experience for us — and for our guests. From the venue tour all the way up through the wedding day, the Little Hills staff were clear and friendly when communicating, took time to listen and get to know us and what we wanted out of our wedding, and just generally very easy to work with. Little Hills Events can be quite flexible based on what you want, ranging from having food, beverage, and a lot of decorations available in-house to allowing outside vendors or BYO. The venue itself is beautiful, with multiple options for ceremony sites and a nice reception area that is tented but still feels fresh and part of the natural environment. Our wedding was in late May and the weather was lovely, with the hills still green and super pleasant temperatures. Overall we are so happy with our wedding and couldn’t imagine it being anywhere else!

This is the best venue ever! The staff was awesome and open to us. Kevin was our events account manager and he really helpful. The venue offers ample space for +150-180 guests at our wedding. You really have to work with the space and surrounding to make it unique and your own. The kitchen is a good size for a catering company to use. Yes, they do allow outside catering as well outside DJ. In general, the price and cost of renting the venue is the best deal for couples on a budget. The park is great as well for photography. The rose garden is a nice place to have cocktail hour. I highly recommend booking an additional room for storing belongings and bags.
