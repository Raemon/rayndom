What can I say……Mercedes was absolutely phenomenal!!!!!!!!!! Mercedes completely exceeded my expectations, and my bouquets were stunning!!!!!! FIVE STARS ACROSS THE BOARD! From the moment I talked with her, I knew I wanted to work with her. We had several phone conversations because she wanted to make sure I was completely happy with my bouquets. She was very attentive to every little detail, down to specific colors and flower options. Mercedes was very easy to talk too and she communicated very well. She sourced high quality flowers for my bouquets. Mercedes really brought my vision to life, and my bouquets looked amazing during my wedding day. I can not recommend her enough!!!!!!!! Thank you thank you Mercedes for your wonderful talent!

Our wedding was April 20, 2024 and Alex and the team did an absolutely stunning job with our wedding flowers! Every arrangement was beautifully crafted, with attention to every little detail. The flowers were fresh, vibrant, and added the perfect touch to our special day. Alex really listened to our vision and brought it to life beyond what we imagined. We couldn’t have asked for a more talented and professional florist. Thank you for making our wedding day unforgettable!

Addison was such a great vendor. Her creative ideas made my flowers amazing. She followed up with me throughout all the months prior to my wedding. Her constant communication was very appreciated. She even helpped my plan other things with other vendors. She was so helpful throughout my whole planning process not just my flowers!!! Thanks girl

Leslie has been so flexible and communicative through this whole process. We reached out to her very early on in our wedding planning process and she was very helpful with fine tuning out vision. She sent plenty of pictures with what she thought would look good and what the complete pieces looked like. We live out of town and won't be back until the wedding and she is being very flexible and understanding with the pickup date. The flowers themselves are gorgeous and we are excited to show them off to everyone!

I had the pleasure of working with Nancy for my wedding recently, in early August 2021. From the moment I contacted Nancy online to the follow-up after the wedding, everything was wonderful! Personally, I love flowers yet I can’t speak to them nor do I really know what is what - I simply think they all look nice! Ha! Therefore, Nancy utilized her expertise and artistry to create exactly what I was looking for without me really even having to explain much! It was such a great feeling to work with someone who is not only kind, honest and caring yet very patient, understanding and efficient! Additionally, I informed Nancy straight out of the gate that I didn’t want to spend a fortune on flowers, as the wedding itself (also having been postponed a year!) was costly enough. She didn’t impose any minimum spend requirements like most florists and couldn’t have been more understanding! Initially, one of the elements I really appreciated was her responsiveness and upfront price quotes. This was hard to find with other florists I had contacted. I highly recommend Nancy for any event and look forward to working with her in the future! She is the best!!!

Charlotte did such an amazing job with our wedding flowers. We initially had a phone call to discuss what my vision would be and after that she made it a reality. I am so excited that we will have my bridal bouquet forever, too. She made 6 aisle arrangements, 2 sprays for the wedding arch, and the bouquets. All of them were beautiful and looked real. She even gave flowers to top the cake as well. Thank you so much, Charlotte!
