Absolutely the best!

Wyvonne and her team were easy to work with, prompt, and efficient. I gave them my vision and they delivered + some. For your small intimate events their space is perfect and you don't have to look any further. Prices are comparable and they delivered!

Graduation Party

I can't say enough about this venue and the owners. They helped me plan out my event, made great suggestions and had me on a timeline so there was absolutely no last-minute unforseen things left undone, and as a result, my event went off without a hitch. The room is beautiful as it is, but when I walked in with everything decorated set up, it took my breath away. Beautiful...just beautiful. They didn't stop at the beautiful setup, they catered to my guests during the event and also moved my program along. I highly recommend this venue, Another Successful Event is my go to from now on. Love love love this place and the staff.

Bumpus Wedding Event

My event at this venue exceeded my expectations. I had seen this location several years ago and had no idea how it could be transformed. Wyvonne and her teams’ attention to detail was impeccable.  
First of all, there was more than enough seating and folks had room to mingle. There was a lot of natural lighting which made my pictures come out fantastic.  
I would definitely be using this venue again as I can see this place can be transformed into whatever your heart desires.

Beautiful Event Space!

We were looking a very elegant and personal setting and that is what we got with Another Successful Event. The team really outdone themselves with every detail. They made everything so special and how they transformed their venue to exactly how I wanted my wedding to look was amazing. The area is around the venue is so beautiful and peaceful as well. There is also lovely hotel right down the street that we stayed at which was vey convenient. Everything about working with the ladies was perfect and I highly recommend Another Successful Event not only for weddings but their event space can be used for all kinds of events and the ladies are amazing with transforming their space.
