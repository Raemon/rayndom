Perfect for our wedding

Parris was awesome to work with for our ceremony. His live guitar definitely set the mood and vibe for the entire day. He was so easy to work with and was very quick to respond throughout our entire process. I would book him again in the future for any formal event and recommend him for anyone looking for a guitar player.

October 2024 Wedding

All I have ever wanted was to walk down the aisle to Lover by Taylor Swift, but I couldn’t find a version of the song that felt right. Parris delivered EXACTLY what I was dreaming of and made my wedding ceremony absolutely perfect! Not only was the aisle song dreamy, the whole wedding day with live guitar was magical. Highly highly recommend!

Such a good addition to make our wedding day feel special! Such good music for us and our guests to enjoy through the night 

Multiple cool guitars, dressed to impress, and well prepared. What a good choice to hire him for our wedding.

Beautiful music

Parris was so wonderful to work with. He was the one thing in the wedding planning process that I didn’t have to worry about. He was great with communicating with me and keeping me up to date the months prior to the wedding date. He was always willing to help me when I had questions. He went above and beyond to make my day so special. He even learned a new song to play for when I walked down the aisle. Which was a big deal because this song was a very special song and I couldn’t imagine my big day without that song being played. His version of the song was more beautiful than the original. Parris was an important part of the wedding day and I’m so glad we got to work together. I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for live music to be played at any event!
