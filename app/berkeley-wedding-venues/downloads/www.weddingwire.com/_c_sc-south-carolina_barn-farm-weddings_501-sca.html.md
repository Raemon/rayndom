They are amazing to work with and made the process simple and easy! I would definitely recommend this venue for any event! We had our wedding here and it was the perfect place with enough space, tables and chairs! They went out their way to make sure we had a great experience!

We made the best decision when choosing Twelve Oak for our big day! For our Fall 2025 wedding we ended up using Twelve Oak Estate as well as their bartender/alcohol package, audio guestbook, day of coordinator (Jo & Co. Planning), and DJ (Events by Snow). All of these vendors were top tier. We truly could not have gotten through the day without Josie from Jo & Co organizing/setting up and Kevin our DJ kept the night moving flawlessly with great music. My only recommendation would be to book any add ons when you sign your contract - We decided to add on alcohol after we secured the venue and ended up having to pay more due to a change in SC liquor laws (not the venues fault but also wasn't clearly outlined anywhere). Our day went perfectly and we even had Bradley from the venue helping out on the day of to assist elderly guests using the golfcart, directing traffic, and ensuring our ceremony wasn't interrupted. We can't recommend this venue enough! Be sure to stop in for a tour and see everything they have to offer. The packages are a great help and we didn't have to worry about a thing.

We were the band for a recent wedding at South Wind Ranch, and we had the pleasure of working with Jessica Nepsha. She was organized, clear, and completely on top of the timeline, making load-in, setup, and performance smooth and stress-free. Jessica is exactly the kind of coordinator vendors hope for: proactive, calm, and easy to communicate with. Everything ran seamlessly, and we always knew where to be and when. Her work was evident throughout the venue. The florals and overall design were beautiful, intentional, and suited so well for the space. From a vendor standpoint, Jessica is a true professional and a pleasure to work with. We would gladly work with her again and highly recommend her to couples and vendors alike.

Belleview Meadows was the perfect venue for our wedding! The entire property is absolutely beautiful. It made the perfect backdrop for both our rehearsal dinner and our wedding day. The team was so flexible and accommodating, making everything easy and stress-free from start to finish. Every detail was just right, and our guests couldn’t stop raving about how gorgeous and welcoming the venue was. We are so glad we chose Belleview Meadows for such an important day. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a stunning and versatile place to celebrate!

⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ Gus & Ana were extremely helpful in all stages of the wedding planning right through our exit. Highly recommended this venue where your options are only limited by your imagination at this pristine venue. Our daughter’s wedding was perfect! They chose to use one of your beautiful fields and tree-line for their ceremony. Our guests list of over 160 people had plenty of room to spread out for the reception in and around your barn area. BCF comfortably accommodated 2 food trucks, a cigar bar, mobile bartenders, DJ, dance floor, charcuterie tables and all our guests!! Highly recommend, 5 star service & venue

Best person to work with ever. Jessie makes you feel like family and has been more than understanding with my fiancé’s deployment through this process. I can’t wait to see all her hard work come to life!!!
