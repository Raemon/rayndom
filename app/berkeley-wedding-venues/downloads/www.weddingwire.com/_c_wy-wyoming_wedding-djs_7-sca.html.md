DJ Zimbo was the best! He played just what we wanted and everything we needed to keep the party going! He went out of his way to get me the song I wanted to walk down the aisle to and made my dreams happen. Read the room well and helped adjust the vibe when needed and kept everyone, ages 2 to 90, on the dance floor. Couldn't have had a better experience.

DJ Mike was great to work with! He really wanted to make the event exactly what we wanted, and he did! We told him what to play and what not to play, and he did a great job including everything - and he wasn't afraid to turn down guest's song suggestions and make himself the bad guy if it was something we didn't want! He also did a great job with the announcing, even though we kept changing things around on him. On the wedding day, he got to the venue even earlier than we did to set up, and to help my flute choir with their sound. He fit in seamlessly with our perfect day.

Jake was absolutely incredible for our wedding at the Grand Targhee Resort. He was very responsive and flexible with all the curveballs that were thrown our way. Our wedding was first rescheduled from 2020 to 2021 due to COVID restrictions. He was able to switch dates with no issues. We had a live performer for the first dance and he was accommodating with set up to his sound system and making our first dance sound incredible and then being able to jump right into the father-daughter and mother-son dance with his system. We also had a hiccup with our photograph time due to weather and had to sneak away during the reception to finish this. He was able to keep guests entertained during this time and able to pick up our scheduled timeline as soon as we were done. He was able to read the room and play music that kept people on the dance floor. I would highly recommend him to anyone in the Teton and surrounding areas.

Rob is the best! We booked him for our wedding in Gillette and he made the reception so much fun! He has a great selection of music, responded to every request from guests and had great ideas to get people out on the dance floor. He is very personable and both he had great ideas to keep everyone having fun. Our wedding was a bit nontraditional and he helped us find the right mix of tradition and uniqueness to make the whole reception feel personal. His wife is amazing too! She took pictures during the reception and they both seemed to have fun all night- really adding to the festive feel! We did our wedding on a very tight budget but hiring Rob was worth every penny. Seriously, if he's available, I would book him in a second!

John from Carry On Celebrations was an AMAZING DJ!! I have had family and friends commenting to me since the wedding about what a great job he did. A friend recommended Carry On Celebrations to us since they do the live karaoke at the bar she works at, and we went solely off of that recommendation. My fiance and I were unable to meet John at all before the wedding, so I had to communicate with him only by e-mail and phone and he was great - he clarified things so that he could make sure we were on the same page. At the wedding, John did a wonderful job. He was very responsive to what my new husband and I said or asked of him and made sure that he was doing things that worked for us. However, he worked mostly autonomously, based on the info that we had discussed via e-mail, and he played GREAT music. He did pay attention to my husband and I's music preferences, but he also read the crowd really well and we had almost the whole room dancing! He didn't do what some DJ's do and play the "older" stuff first, then later in the night play the "younger" songs after older guests leave. He played a great mix. He did some country songs, but not too many in a row as that would have driven some of our guests off the floor - same with pop, rock, oldies, and even dubstep! He kept it interesting and struck a GREAT balance that had everybody happy and having fun. When there was a slight lull, he knew just what to do to get the party moving again and it worked!!! He made announcements as we asked and was a great MC, reading the room and saying the right things at the right times. He dressed appropriately and was present and attentive throughout the entire reception. Our reception was an absolute blast!! The DJ shaped the entire atmosphere of the party. If you are looking for a fun, active reception that keeps people dancing and having fun, Carry On Celebrations is the way to go - I can't recommend them enough!!

Chad Rose and Scott Killian were fantastic to work with. Our wedding was above Buffalo, WY, in the Big Horn Mountains and even though rain caused some changes in the day, Scott (who did the actual DJ’ing) had no issues rolling with the changes. Chad worked with us before hand to get a rough timeline laid out and Scott later checked in to confirm the plans. Scott kept everything moving forward and did a great job of handling music requests, speeches, and general coordination of events. Honestly, I couldn’t be happier with how well they did for us.

My husband and I loved working with Liam for our wedding last summer! He utilized a detailed form to get to know our musical likes and dislikes and asked many questions about our musical tastes and the flow/feel of the wedding. Using these tools he custom tailored the music to our exact taste and kept the party going all night! His equipment is state of the art and came in super handy for our off grid wedding! He and his gorgeous up lights saved the day when our rental lighting failed. Thankful we went with Liam for our big day!

Michael was wonderful to work with through the process of planning my wedding. He came to the rehearsal dinner beforehand to scope out location for set up and to explain to me where he was going to be placing equipment. Sound quality was WONDERFUL and he even shared our ceremony audio with our videographer to input into our professional wedding video.
