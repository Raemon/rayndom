Picking out floral was the most difficult decision during the wedding planning process. Everything looked great. My first phone call with Lauren helped so much! I ended up changing my decision and they nailed it in every way. Highly recommend. 10/10

Claire is INCREDIBLE!!! Her attention to detail is just insane. She sits down with you to understand exactly what you want, opening little photo books pointing out flowers to see if that’s in the vision or not. She is so bubbly and easy to work with always with a smile on her face, no matter what she’s going through. I would recommend her again and again and again to everyone I know. You will NOT be disappointed with her.

I'm a wedding planner who worked with Marah a few weeks ago at a wedding and she was fantastic to work with! Leading up to the wedding day she was super responsive and communicative, and day of her florals were absolutely stunning. Highly recommend if you're looking for a florist! -Hanna, Hanna Marie Events

Kim and the team at Artemisia helped make our wedding day perfect. She was so easy to communicate with throughout the process and made the planning fun, especially with the flower trial! The floral arrangements were absolutely BEAUTIFUL, they did such a great job, and I was obsessed with my bouquet! We got a lot of compliments on the flowers and decorations, and it was a huge help for them to do the entire set-up and breakdown at the end of the night. Highly recommend Kim, we are so happy she was our florist for the wedding!

We booked Sadie's Couture Floral as our wedding florist. My now wife and I are extremely pleased with the services we received and would recommend that anyone book with them too. Originally we heard of Sadie's as my sister used them for their wedding. This review nearly writes itself just in the fact that it inspired my wife and I to book them again for our own wedding. Now working with them for two weddings I can confidently say that they know what they are doing and can provide a variety of floral options for different desires, seasons, events, and styles. In our case we opted for the A La Carte floral. This offered a wide menu of floral options to pick and then the Sadie's team helped deliver on the theme and variety within that structure. We found this to be an exceptional affordable way to still get some amazing flowers to adorn our event. While I cannot comment on their full style/design packages I'm more than confident they too would be amazing. The Sadie's team was professional, communicated effectively, were flexible to our needs, and ultimately provided us a great experience. This is just a small note but when we picked up our flowers we ended up needing scissors for something else while at their pickup door. Without a second though Averil gave us the pair of scissors she had and left us with a smile on our faces. This small act of kindness just helps to show the value they put in their customers.

Elishia with Lakeside Floral was amazing from our first meeting through delivering the flowers for our wedding. Even though we had minimal floral aspects of our wedding, she still took the care and time you would have expected for a much larger order. We’ve since dried some of the flowers and they are a forever keepsake to remind us of our wonderful wedding.
