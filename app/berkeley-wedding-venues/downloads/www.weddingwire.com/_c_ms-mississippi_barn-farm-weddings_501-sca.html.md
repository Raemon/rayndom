I fell in love with this venue a couple years ago when I attended a wedding here and knew it was one of my top contenders when searching for my venue. The lady that does the tours really explains everything well and they offer so much! I can’t wait for my big day here!!

I was in awe of the detail and effort put into the wedding I attended recently. Everywhere you looked was pure perfection. The table decor provided an intimate setting. The flowers and decorations provided a fairy like atmosphere from ceiling to floor. There were so many places to take pictures. I give Sullivan Barn A+ including a dedicated staff

This venue is all around perfect if you’re looking for the rustic/country themed reception, party, anything. Mrs. Ramona is super great with communicating and the price was right in our budget. My husband and i had our reception here and it was perfect environment. we had 225 people and it rained so we were all inside and there was a huge dance floor. they have tables and chairs.
