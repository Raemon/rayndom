If you're looking for a unique wedding venue in the Philadelphia/Camden area, I highly recommend checking out Adventure Aquarium! We enjoyed working with Megan throughout the planning process. She was patient with us and our many questions throuhgout the process. She was also flexible when we had to make changes to our seating chart the weekend before our wedding. We loved that the venue was able to accommodate our guests' various dietary restrictions. The venue had a wide variety of options to choose from for entrees, appetizers, and desserts. The day itself went off without a hitch and we loved seeing our vision come to life! The food was amazing, especially the roasted acorn squash! Our bridal attendant, Darlene, was so helpful. She made sure that we had what we needed throughout the whole night, including making sure that the two of us were able to eat during the cocktail hour and the reception. We were so thankful for her help throughout the whole event. The biggest highlights of the night were having our first look in the shark tunnel and the cocktail hour penguin! Our guests seemed like they had just as much fun as we did

Our vision for our wedding was always to capture the charm and essence of Long Beach Island. We were looking for an open space where we could bring our vision to life, and LBIF not only delivered that but exceeded all of our expectations. Jaime, the Wedding and Special events coordinator, was spectacular from the very start. She was responsive, flexible, transparent, and made us feel like we were working with a friend rather than a venue contact. Planning a wedding from out of state can be stressful, but Jay made everything feel easy. She helped with everything—from vendor suggestions in the planning stages to being there throughout our entire reception. Not only did we fall in love with the LBIF, which provided the perfect atmosphere for our big day, but the staff’s dedication to our wedding was beyond anything we could have asked for. They were incredibly receptive to all of our needs, big or small, and treated us with such care that it felt like we were family. Jay truly made the entire planning process seamless and enjoyable. There’s no better feeling than watching your dream wedding come together with all the support you could need. If you’re looking for a venue where the possibilities are endless, look no further. Beauty really is in the details, and you can absolutely find it at LBIF.

Our wedding was absolutely magical and this is mostly due to the beauty of GFS and the attentiveness of their team. We had the ceremony at the Nine Muses statue which is iconic and then took over Rat’s restaurant for the reception. We were able to take photos around the entire sculpture garden in the morning - even managed to get one of the peacocks to pose with us! The volunteers and staff at GFS are all very kind. The team at Rat’s is incredibly professional. Because it’s a top rated restaurant, the food and drinks were delicious and we didn’t have to worry about bringing in tables/chairs etc. and the ambiance is great, so no need for major decor elements. The Monet garden is just so romantic. Lindsey was so responsive and made the entire planning process a joy. Do not hesitate to have your wedding at GFS/Rat’s - it will be the best day ever!

Liberty Hall is truly a hidden gem in Northern NJ. We searched through a ton of places and were really struggling to find something that was right for us and fit within our budget. We got married in September and the grounds were absolutely beautiful – they made the perfect backdrop for our ceremony and photos. The tent was great for the ceremony, we fit 140 comfortably and had plenty of room for dancing. Though it’s on Kean’s campus, it’s totally secluded and was quiet without a lot of street or traffic noise. And it has the benefit of being near the airport and lots of hotel options which was really convenient for people traveling. We were also so lucky to get to work with Mei, the event coordinator. She does an excellent job and is so kind and helpful throughout the entire process. Her and her team made sure everything was set up perfectly and that all went according to plan. If you’re looking for a simple but beautiful outdoor venue, I can’t recommend Liberty Hall enough!

Our wedding at the noyes was absolutely beautiful. It is a very romantic setting, right on the lake, with beautiful hardwood floors, big windows high ceilings and white walls, not to mention the amazing artwork. You don't even need to bother with decorations, it's just so beautiful. My guests have been complimenting the museum, saying it was so perfect because it gave people something to do, the dining tables were in one gallery the ceremony in another, and the dance floor and bar was in the central deck. The cool thing was you could go from place to place, and couples could go and look at the art, it was just so romantic. Our wedding photos came out so gorgeous there. Plus having the dance floor away from the dining meant that you didn't feel like people were just staring at you from the tables while you danced, it was the perfect size too and people really danced all night. And the dining room gave the older relatives a place to sit and talk without the music begin too loud for them. The coolest thing is we can go back and visit whenever we want, and I think it's one of my favorite places in the world now.

We had a fabulous experience hosting our wedding at the Montclair Art Museum. We mostly worked with Meryl, who took over running weddings at the MAM last year. She was incredibly responsive, attentive, and communicative throughout the process, providing true caring and enthusiasm for our wedding. While the MAM is a “load-in” venue, they have an excellent sound system, kitchens for catering staff to work from, and incredible lighting that makes the room stunningly romantic during the ceremony and fun during the reception. Guests LOVED being able to browse the museum as part of the cocktail hour, and Leir Hall is a truly beautiful room. For a wedding with many disabled guests including the bride and her mom, we were very impressed from day one with how accessible the venue is compared to others that we saw. While there is room for improvement, there was a lot of care and support with accessibility (including having a great, dedicated accessibility professional at the museum). Some words of advice for future married couples: one thing to be mindful of in planning your wedding here is some of the needs that relate to protecting the artwork, like only serving clear liquid in Lehman Court or requiring vendors be a certain distance from the wall to keep art safe - not a problem, just a consideration with what drinks you serve. And given the complexity of loading in various vendors, we definitely benefitted significantly from having a caterer who is used to working there (Cheryl from Church Street Catering) and a day-of coordinator to help keep everyone in sync. In conclusion, Meryl and the team really went above and beyond many times, from helping to plan out every aspect of the day to helping with many needs throughout the day. I highly recommend the MAM, it is a beautiful place that made for a truly incredible wedding.
