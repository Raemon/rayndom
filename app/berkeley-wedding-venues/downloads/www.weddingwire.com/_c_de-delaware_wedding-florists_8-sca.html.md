We got married at Glen Foerd in Philly. My MIL found Vicki and Paula at a farmers market in Lewes Delaware and I'm so happy that she did! They were so sweet and easy to work with from the start. They not only do amazing wedding florals, but they grow all of them as well! Everyone in the wedding party and myself were in love with the floral arrangements when we finally saw them on the day of. After more than a year of planning it was so incredible to see it come to life! The flowers were bursting with color and so vibrant. I wanted a “late summer sunset” palate in the fall and these ladies delivered! They chose the most perfect bud vases for my table scape and also were able to set up my candles and candlesticks. Every vision I had (and there were many that evolved over the year and a half I planned and they were soo patient with me) they understood and brought it to life. On top of everything they are sooo sweet to work with I felt like they were just two more aunts that I had! Last but not least they will not break the bank relative to some of the other florists in the philly area that we looked at. Highly recommend, can't say enough good things about these ladies!

Bay St Blooms made ordering our flowers for our wedding day seamless and easy. They were extremely responsive and friendly throughout the entire process. The flowers turned out gorgeous! I would definitely use Bay St Blooms again.

Everything Forget Me Not Florist created from my vision was breathtaking. My bouquet, and my bridesmaids bouquets were exactly what I described I wanted to their team and the pergola arch floral was worth every penny. I took it home after our ceremony I loved it so much.

I don't know anything about flowers, and they were able to guide my color selection, listen to my ideas, and ran with it! We absolutely LOVED the bouquets and corsages. Heather was very responsive, professional, and was able to work within my price range. Would definitely recommend.

I had to find flowers at the last minute (about 24 hours before my ceremony)...issue with original florist and Mayumi came through. Many of my guests kept saying what great flowers I had and how they matched the teal dresses I choose perfectly. She asked what we wanted and needed. She was able to deliver the vision I had in my head within my budget. She was honest about what flowers I was going to be able to get and how it was going to look. Delivery and set up was included which helped minimize the stress of the day. 100% would recommend her if you are looking for a florist. She is up front and honest. I wish I would have gone with her originally.

Jess and the entire team at Styled was great to work with! The florals complemented our venue so well and was exactly the costal elegance vibe we were going for! Very easy to work with. Cannot thank them enough for helping with and executing our vision!

The Quills ladies did the flowers for my wedding in September of 2017. They did an amazing job. I'm not one for flowers but Theresa made me change my mind! I was a total bridezilla and kept changing my mind but she was so patient and almost read my mind every time! I was so happy with all my flowers, especially the flower crowns for me and my flower girl.

I can't say enough about how fantastic it was to deal with Wendy at Forget me-not Florist. She understood exactly what I wanted and explained everything in detail. Whenever I emailed her with a question it was answered almost immediately. Even though she was extremely busy with other weddings and proms I always felt like I was her number one priority. All my guests couldn't stop talking about the beautiful flowers. She went above and beyond all my expectations!!! The amount of flowers and size of the arrangements for the price was unbelievable!
