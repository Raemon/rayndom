I was married at Barns at Crest Hill and it succeeded all of my expectations. First the view is unbelievable. Watching the sunset over the little mountain in the backdrop and lake Athlone with Irish music playing was picture perfect. We had a little hide-away bar in the silo itself, and it felt like we were in a medieval tower. This is not a cutesy country farm with lots of rough spots showing... It is regal property where every corner has been perfected, and where you can craft the perfect vision you have for your wedding and make it a reality. Another favorite? The majestic fireplace overlooking a pebblsteone patio that rivaled the pavilion as a dance floor. Your guest will find plenty of nooks. Just sneak inside to the pub, or upstairs for a window view and soak it all in. Amazing people to do business with, amazing location, and the nearby town of Marshall is picture perfect Americana. Don't miss the Red Truck Bakery!

Our wedding at MV was absolutely gorgeous. I chose the site not only because my parents had gotten married there 28 years prior, but also because it blends historic charm, elegance, and good service. Ashley was wonderful to work with. She's kind and gracious, cheerful, and just absolutely lovely. Throughout the tasting and multiple meetings, everyone else we encountered was very pleasant. I'd love to personally thank the woman who waited on our sweetheart table the night of. My husband and I couldn't finish our meal (you get generous portions which is awesome!) which of course happens when you need to talk to your guests, and the staff packed up everything including cake so we could enjoy the food later that night. The sunken garden is a great spot for a ceremony. We can even attest that it's pretty well-protected during a torrential downpour. We loved that the space has multiple rooms for the event. That allowed guests who didn't want to be around for loud music during dancing to go socialize on their own. We were able to plan the evening with the help of Ashley so that guests did not have to move to different rooms too many times throughout the evening in order to watch events. One note to be aware of - when you pay for wedding coordination, you are paying for a team of people. I'd glossed over that while reading the planning materials, and was rather thrown off when several people tag-teamed running the event the day of. Nevertheless, Anthony handled everything very professionally, and the night went well. Oh, and I should also mention that Anthony ran our rehearsal, and was phenomenal at organizing everyone, and giving me advice on how walking down the aisle should go (something I hadn't thought much about till that moment!). This really is the most original event space you'll find in the DC area that isn't going to break the bank. The staff is very kind, the food excellent, and the amenities wonderful. Quick tip: We took most of our photos right outside the inn (and they were amazing), but literally two minutes down the highway on the right is a little park on the river where we took couple photos. They turned out beautifully. Photos by Tori Parker Photography

I am an Indian bride and my husband and I hosted our Indian Wedding Reception at Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Spring, 2025. We utilized the Woodrow Wilson Plaza, Oculus, and Atrium for our cocktail hour and reception. Booking our event at the Reagan Building included furniture rentals, food, bar, and servers. We selected the Ronald Reagan Building as our Wedding Reception location early on during our wedding planning process. From the beginning, we were blown away, not only by the beauty and modern look of the space, but also by the warmth and attentiveness of the Wedding Planning team. We planned our wedding from another city, and Sienna, our initial point of contact and Sales Manager made that experience seamless for us. She answered questions promptly and when we were in town, hosted us on multiple venue tours as we selected other Reception vendors and finalized details for our event. She also gave us amazing advice along the way, helping us to finalize the scope of our decor, lighting, audio, schedule, and menu. Speaking of food - having the perfect appetizer, cocktail, and dinner menu for our Reception was extremely important to us! We wanted to have a plated dinner with a mix of Indian and Western appetizer and entree options, but we also had some strict dietary restrictions to accommodate within our menu. Sienna, our Wedding Planner Paul, and Head Chef Gohary worked patiently with us to build a menu we were so excited about. Chef and his team created multiple custom entrees for us which turned out better than we ever imagined! They were also able to accommodate all of our dietary restriction requests within our menu, giving us confidence that all of our guests would be able to fully enjoy their meals at our event. The team, along with Service Manager Rene, hosted a lovely menu tasting for us, diligently incorporated our feedback, and even hosted my husband and I for a second “mini-tasting” to make sure that everything was perfect for the big day. During our tasting, they also helped us to choose our chairs, linens, and table settings. When it came to the night of our Reception, the Reagan team executed on everything flawlessly. Paul assisted our vendors through the check-in and set-up process, and Paul, Sienna, and Rene were all in attendance that night to make sure everything went off without a hitch! The event set-up, food, and service were impeccable; we received compliments from our guests for months afterwards! I can’t recommend the Ronald Reagan Building enough as a venue for any and all Wedding events. The team was a joy to work with and the results were perfection. Thank you, Reagan team!

Had the absolute best experience holding our wedding at the Silk Mill!! The venue itself is beautiful both indoors and outside, but the staff is what really blew me away!! Our day-of coordinator, Sarah, was so helpful in making sure every detail was planned and ready leading up to the day. On our actual wedding day, she set up all of our decor, coordinated with vendors, kept us on schedule, helped me with my dress, helped out with pictures, and probably so much more I didn’t even see!! We received so many compliments from our guests on how smoothly the evening went, and that is all thanks to Sarah and the other Silk Mill staff!! Everyone was truly so nice and helpful and really went above and beyond to make sure we had the best day!!! I would absolutely recommend this venue, they will not disappoint!!

It was the very first — and only — place we toured. Even after researching other options, we kept comparing everything back to this one, and nothing else came close. We are so glad we trusted our hearts and chose this venue. From the very beginning, the service was exceptional. We booked all the houses on the property, which allowed our entire family to stay together for the whole weekend — and that alone made the experience unforgettable. Sharing the laughter, excitement, and quiet moments leading up to the big day with everyone in one place was so incredibly special. The catering was absolutely phenomenal — our guests are still raving about how amazing the food was! And we can’t say enough wonderful things about our Wedding Coordinator, Taylor. She truly went above and beyond, making sure every detail reflected who we are as a couple. She handled everything — from the rehearsal to the ceremony to the reception — with care, grace, and expertise, managing all of our outside vendors seamlessly. The property itself is breathtaking, with beautiful spots everywhere you turn. This venue gave us the wedding weekend of our dreams, and we will forever be grateful. If you’re considering this place, don’t hesitate — you will not regret it!

My wife and I could not be happier with our choice to have our wedding at Friends Meeting of Washington. The entire team was responsive, flexible, kind, and truly happy for us on our big day. They were willing to answer any and all questions, and were there on site day of to assist with anything we needed. It's a great value for the space, and the outdoor garden area is absolutely gorgeous in the spring and summer! We couldn't recommend them enough!

Josephine Butler Parks Center (JPBC) is such a beautiful venue, we had our wedding there in November of 2024 and couldn’t have picked a better place. The entire process of venue selection can be daunting, and JBPC made it easy for us. We signed up for an initial walkthrough and fell in love with the history of the building, the unique layout, and the beautiful art and color schemes in each room. Steve guided us on our tour and answered all our questions, and we knew right away that this was where we wanted to hold our wedding. Taking several months to plan our wedding, we coordinated with JPBC staff to do two additional tours where they answered even more questions and allowed us to see what different lighting configurations looked like and make measurements to finalize our configuration for the big day. For the reception, we decided to seat our guests in the main ballroom, have the dance floor on the second floor foyer, place the bar out on the balcony, and serve the buffet and cake in the south gallery. Seating was a little tight in the main ballroom, as we had our guests sit at fifteen round tables that were 5 feet in diameter, with a sweetheart table by the larger fireplace. But we made it work and it was a fantastic day for us overall!

My daughter and son in law were married in our local Parish Church at the end of May and we decided we wanted as close to turnkey reception as we could get! Airlie pavilion was amazing! We were able to handle 180 guests, with dance floor, mid range bar, and delicious 2 entree buffet! Everyone had a wonderful time and the Good Lord provided perfect weather that allowed us to open the all glass walls! It was a magical day and Airlie staff was amazing! Marcela was so helpful and accommodating and really allowed us relax and enjoy ourselves after she helped us plan down to the smallest detail. Thanks so much!

Historic Rosemont @rosemontmanor Day 1 - Arrival The Bride and Groom hosted welcome parties in the houses on the grounds for their family and close friends. It allowed for guests to meet one another and catch up before the big day. It helped our guests to understand the grounds and know where all of the big events were going to take place. Many wish to come back for a big sleepover. Day 2 - The Big Day The Bride and Groom stayed in the Byrd's nest and enjoyed breakfast at the Manor. It was all freshly made with local ingredients. With help from family, the DIY photobooth was set up; the groom had all the supplies and the bride designed it. Family also decorated the isle and arbor provided by Rosemont. The getting ready suit for the Bride and Groom was spacious and had more than enough outlets for Hair, Makeup and any last minute steaming needs. For the first look for the Father of the Bride and the Groom were in the Manor. They were able to hide in the suite while everyone arrived for the ceremony. The couple hid bubble guns under the chairs for their exit and it was a big big hit with the children and adults. The Bride and Groom also planned a special surprise for everyone, FIREWORKS! Which was a guest happiness. Between that and the Hot Chocolate/Cocoa Locoa (@cocoa_beaann) named after their dog, it was hard to only have one favorite. The couple was fortunate to be early with their timeline and had family portraits before the ceremony and allowed for them to enjoy cocktail hour once their own portraits were completed. During the ceremony the DJ, caterer, bartender, and wedding planners made everything extraordinarily special. We would do it all over again with everyone. The caterer also lit the fire outside and was super warm for the after party with Benny's pizza with smores! Day 3 - Exit Our friends helped pack things up the night before but Rosemont allowed us to do it all the morning after. Loading up the cars was a breeze. The breakfast again was very good and homemade! Between the special touches, grounds staff, Rosemont Staff and all the planning with flexibility our dream was able to become a reality. Thank you very much!

I am so incredibly thankful to all the folks at Rockwood Manor. My husband and I had a great experience through and through working with their team. Ryan gave us a tour and answered all my questions thoroughly, Autumn and Ryan helped us and answered more questions as we waited for our wedding to arrive, and Lucy helped tremendously day of work fluffing my veil/train. They provide tables and chairs, which was very convenient for us. The space is so beautiful and prices were so reasonable. If you’re a resident of Montgomery County, you would be eligible for in county discount pricing. My guests raved about how much they loved the venue and how perfect it was. It truly was a perfect day.
