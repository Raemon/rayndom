Janet Jornlin at Apropos is so knowledgeable about wedding invitations you would be crazy to go anywhere else. She made our experience seamless. She was fantastic to work with! I would highly recommend Apropos. Our invitations are absolutely beautiful!

We have used FineStationery for many events, and everything has turned out beautifully! We ordered our rehearsal dinner (Checkerboard), wedding invitations (William Arthur), and wedding program (Checkerboard). With our rehearsal dinner invitations order, everything went smoothly and they were absolutely beautiful! Our wedding invitations were a little different. They shipped much later than expected. After I contacted them to find out when they would be delivered, they were able to overnight them. When they were finally delivered, we still had to have the calligrapher address them so they were mailed to our guests much later than etiquette would allow. The same goes for our wedding program, they did not arrive until the Wednesday before the wedding. We were getting married that Saturday. This was after another email to find out when the programs would be delivered. They were willing to ship them faster, but it was stressful to make sure they were delivered before we went out of town for our destination wedding. However, you can't beat their beautiful products! They do a gorgeous job and have helpful customer service!

Jenny at fulton paper was awesome. Great selection of invitation styles and the price was right. She will send you a template for your final review. We had to make a wording change to our thank you and she had no problems with changing it for us. She also did an assortment of balloons for our wedding day. Working with Jenny was a great stress free experience.

I knew that I didn't want an overly formal invitation that looked like all of the others. I found just the right vendor in This & That Creations. They worked with me to personalize an invitation just for us. They also created a card box for us - not an easy task when I didn't want a bird cage or the standard options. They created a beautiful "beach" themed crab trap to incorporate our colors and fonts from the invitation, programs, etc. These ladies are very professional and flexible - always available to meet with us whenever our schedules brought us to Ocean City.

Everyone at Union Press was super helpful and really walked me through the wedding invite process. They also printed my save the dates, table numbers, programs and various other printed material. I felt really proud to send out my wedding invites because they were beautiful! This is also a mom and pop shop that is family owned so they really take care of you.

The invitations that Debbie, from, Le Papier Amour-Exquisite Wedding Invitations, designed for our wedding were absolutly perfect! She is an artist! I wasted a great deal of time looking at "run of the mill" invitations on the internet and was feeling frustrated until I contacted Debbie! That was the best decision I made. She made the whole process very relaxing and stress free. She was able to use her creativity to design us invitations that were both unique and special to us. Debbie was very professional, helpful, creative, timely, honest and super friendly. She gave us multiple proofs to consider, once we chose the final invitation they were in our hands shortly afterwards. She also designed our programs and thank you notes, If you want invitations that are unique, special and beatuiful you must have Debbie create them! P.S. We recieved sooo many compliments on the invitations!

Katy and her team are the absolute best. We started with Katy for our Save The Dates without a fully baked plan for the rest of our suite and she was so incredible that we continued to use her for our invites and day-of stationary. She blew us away with everything she provided. We received DOZENS of complements on our invites. Katy's full spectrum of services, from industry advice to bespoke design and sketches, set the mood perfectly for the vibe of our wedding day. Her attention to detail and creativity were invaluable. We can't thank her enough.
