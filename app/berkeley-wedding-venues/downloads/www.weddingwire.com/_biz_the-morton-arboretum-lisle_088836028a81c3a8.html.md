We loved our Morton Arboretum wedding!

We were very happy with the Morton Arboretum and Ginkgo Catering for our June wedding! Our ceremony was in the beautiful Founders Room, and our reception was just down the hall in the Arbor Room. Jennie and Lisa, our venue and catering coordinators, were both easy to work with and answered all our questions throughout the process. The food was tasty, and we felt so taken care of by the staff on our big day! Also, one of the biggest reasons we chose the Morton Arboretum is because of their dedication to sustainability and environmentalism. It was so reassuring to know that our money went toward such an important organization and that they follow sustainable practices, like composting uneaten food instead of just tossing it. This is probably the most waste-producing event we’ll ever host, so having a venue that cares about sustainability was incredibly important to us. We definitely recommend the Morton Arboretum!

Denise is the very best!

My wife and I got married this summer, and chose the Thornhill Education Center for our wedding venue. The Morton Arboretum had everything we needed for a beautiful wedding and reception, where all the photos from our special day feature scenic trees, flowers, and rolling grassy hills.  
  
We had the privilege of working with Denise for all our wedding needs. Denise was incredibly experienced, helpful, and guided us through the entire process. She recommended great vendors and was always there when we had questions. She anticipated so many of our needs, and made the big day so special!  
  
Denise also helped us connect with Jill, our contact for the venue's catering team. The food was extraordinary. It might sound a bit weird, but my wife and I didn't know our wedding day would feature the world's most delicious mashed potatoes. Jill and the team were so friendly, personally stopping by to make sure the food was perfect (it was) and made sure we had everything we needed. And seriously the mashed potatoes were SO GOOD!  
  
I cannot imagine our wedding anywhere but the Morton Arboretum, and we are so grateful for the perfect weather and the beautiful memories we created there!

A Perfect Day

We recently had the pleasure of hosting a wedding at the Morton Arboretum, and it was an exceptional experience. The venue itself is breathtaking, with beautiful landscapes that provided the perfect backdrop for the ceremony and photos. Working with Denise was an absolute delight; she was incredibly flexible, kind, friendly, and responsive throughout the entire planning process. Her professionalism and warm demeanor made everything run smoothly and stress-free. We highly recommend the Morton Arboretum for anyone looking for a stunning venue with outstanding service.

Stunning Wedding Backdrop

We couldn’t have been happier to have our wedding at The Morton Arboretum. From the start of the planning process, we felt supported by our facility coordinator, Jennie, and Alicia, our catering coordinator. The grounds were absolutely stunning for pictures and guests appreciated the opportunity to visit the arboretum on our wedding day, prior to festivities. The regular communication and updates from Jennie and Alicia were very helpful throughout our planning and helped us prepare for a very smooth day of. Our only surprise was seeing around 200 other people at the group tasting, which made it difficult to get one on one time with the staff. Alicia, Jennie, and the Chef went above and beyond to accommodate our additional requests. We were very happy with the food on our wedding day and our guests have been raving about it too! The partnership with DeEtta’s Bakery worked out perfectly and we were incredibly happy with our cake. The Ginkgo room was the perfect backdrop to our special day. We are so happy with our experience at The Morton Arboretum and look forward to visiting again.

Great experience with Morton arboretum

Morton arboretum was a perfect venue! All of the coordinators were so helpful, from setting up our venue to the way that we wanted- down to the detail, to making sure our food and drink was just as we envisioned. The food was delicious and our venue had stunning greenery in every shot- what more could you want!

Amazing and detail oriented. Superb staff!

Denise, Jill, and their staff were amazing! Even in our first visit in the middle of winter, Morton Arboretum looked like a magical place to get married. Both Denise and Jill were so helpful to work with during the course of preparing for our wedding. We had a daytime wedding and chose the brunch menu. All of our guests commented on how beautiful everything was and of course about the tasty food!! When I wasn’t totally sure about tablecloth colors and menu items both Denise and Jill were able to offer up suggestions from their expertise. Thank you so much! Our day was made extra special because of Denise and Jill.

A Beautiful Venue!

We loved having our wedding at the White Pine Pavilion of the Morton Arboretum (about 95 guests) and got so many compliments about the venue! We ended up booking the arboretum for our wedding just 9 months before our planned June date after finding out our original venue was going out of business. It was such a stressful scramble to get everything back on track after the venue shift, but Denise was an absolute pleasure to work with. My husband and I both agree we are so glad that we ended up changing venues (even if it obviously wasn't our original plan)! She was so patient with my many questions and was super prompt in responding. Not only that, but she was so much more flexible than our original venue to accommodate our vision and the preferences of the other vendors. There ended up being severe weather (including lightning!) on our wedding day and Denise worked with our wedding planner through several different iterations of plans as the weather forecast kept changing in order to make sure our guests were safe and that we could execute our original vision as closely as possible. It was a huge success! We also enjoyed working with Alicia in Gingko Catering who was also very accommodating through the food selection process. Thank you so much to the whole arboretum team for all of your hard work and for helping make our day so beautiful and special.

Beautiful venue with kind, helpful staff

We had a 100 person wedding at the Thornhill Education Center at Morton Arboretum and it was absolutely perfect. Margaret from Morton and from Ginkgo Catering were both terrific to work with -- incredibly responsive and helpful.  
  
All of the staff during the wedding event were kind and attentive. Had a terrific bartender, too, who people absolutely loved. Great experience!

The best venue

The Morton Arboretum was the only venue my husband & I visited when planning our wedding back in 2/19. We were sure it was the venue for us after meeting with Kim Wilson, coordinator, and, oh my gosh, was it meant to be... Our original wedding date was 3/21/20 and we had to reschedule multiple times due to COVID safety concerns/mitigations. Each & every time, Kim made clear we would get the SAFE, beautiful wedding we were hoping for when we booked; she & her team followed through on that promise and our wedding was more perfect than I could've even dreamed of. First, let me say that Kim is an absolute angel & one of the hardest working people I've ever known. I was a very worried bride BEFORE the pandemic, and that was amplified with everything going on... but Kim treated me with only kindness, respect, empathy, & patience each time we spoke. She always took the time to write me thoughtful, thorough responses to my millions of questions and concerns, & called me to ease my mind if my emails were especially frantic :) It was a long and stressful process for us to have our wedding, but the stress had nothing to do with the Arboretum- they were on top of everything and consistently calmed my nerves. On our wedding day, the coordinators were on top of everything. They communicated well with all of our vendors & everything was seamless. I am a very anxious person by nature, and because of the tireless work of the Arb staff, I had NO anxiety on the day of our wedding (a few guests/wedding party members even commented on how calm and happy I was). I had so much trust in Kim & her team, I was able to be in the moment & worry about nothing. The bartenders were totally amazing too. Heather was a JOY & Anthony was hilarious. They made sure my husband and I were always taken care of. My family was extremely impressed because they asked that my nephews bring their dad over for the official OK before serving them soda :) Everything was done with such care. The drinks were delicious & there was never a line. I noticed almost all people had drinks in their hands/in front of them throughout the night. It was such a testament to how great the service was. Each and every server was extremely kind & hardworking . They were very intentional about checking in with my husband & me too. Additionally, they were very on top of getting empty and unattended glasses. I didn’t see a single random cup all night. We also had the best experience with catering. First we worked with a lovely individual, who personally called me before our wedding to let me know she had a job change, but she would make sure our new catering contact, Jill, knew every detail - SHE DID & she didn't miss a beat. We know she was insanely busy, but she really took the time to make sure we were happy, satisfied, and taken care of. The food was outstanding. My dad, who is insanely picky, couldn't get over how perfectly the filet was cooked. We had Jim the tram driver for our pictures, and he was so knowledgeable, kind, and flexible. He was a lot of fun to have with our crew. I give all of these details because I want to highlight how personable and caring the staff was at the Arboretum. It was an amazing experience working with them. They have hundreds of weddings a year & made us feel special and valued every step of the way. I would recommend the Arboretum a million times over. Thank you to all who helped make our long-awaited day more perfect than we ever could've imagined.

Wonderful experience from start to finish

I have nothing but glowing things to say about the Arboretum. My husband and I were supposed to get married in March of 2020. Two weeks before our day, the world shut down. It was chaotic on a lot of levels, but Margaret and Elana were incredible. They helped us reschedule (twice) and then helped us plan a much smaller intimate ceremony when it was clear we could not have our planned wedding in 2020 at all.   
  
Fast forward 1.5 years to August 2021 - the day was perfect. The venue really is stunning, the food was very good, and the staff were absolutely wonderful. Friendly, attentive, and kind to us and our guests. Our reception was in the Gingko room and I can honestly say I was stunned by how beautiful it looked (we were very fortunate to have a sunny day). You do not need to do a lot of "up-lighting" or anything to make the venue beautiful (which is what I was looking for). Long review to say 10 stars, if you are considering the venue I can assure you the staff will do everything possible to ensure your day goes off without a hitch.
