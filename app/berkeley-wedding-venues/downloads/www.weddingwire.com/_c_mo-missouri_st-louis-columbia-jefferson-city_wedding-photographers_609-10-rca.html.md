McKenzie was the second shooter for our wedding and she honestly captured some of my absolute favorite photos from our day! She was so fun to work with and had great ideas for creative shots. She has a great eye for angles and gives clear direction on what to do to make the shot look perfect!

Sarah and her team were SO incredible to work with! I can’t say enough positive things about them! My husband and I were so lucky to have such a kind, professional, hardworking, talented, and fun team capturing our special day. The pictures turned out absolutely stunning! I love how Sarah and Michelle captured our personalities and feelings throughout every photo as well as all of the personalities in our wedding party. They were so easy and accommodating to work with. I am so excited to have a plethora of amazing photos to look back on as the years go by. Hands down I would book them again!

Epic connected us with two amazing photographers, Kyle and Jackie, who brought such a positive energy to our wedding and reception. They had an eye for detail and were great at guding our friends, family and wedding party, as well as following instructions and being flexible. The photo's turned out well, and Epic was responsive and easy to work with. Thank you for helping capture so many priceless memories!!

Hiring Julia Noack for our wedding photography was one of the best choices we made in planning our big day! From learning our family and wedding party by name (she asked for photos and names ahead of time to make her own flashcards, how sweet is that?), to keeping our wishes for mostly candid, uninterrupted moments, Julia impressed us from day one until the very end. We will continue to call Julia for capturing life's big events because she is *simply* the best! Thank you again, Julia

*Also posted on The Knot* Tracy was amazing to work with in that she was patient, efficient, and kept the wedding party moving in order to capture the best moments of our day. She had fun with us, but was still able to keep us on track. She worked really well with our videographer and set up shots together at times to be able to maximize the time we had dedicated to each photo location. My husband and I love Tracy’s non-traditional style! She is able to capture really unique images by focusing in on smaller details or angles that usually go unnoticed. Due to COVID, we had a hybrid wedding of in person guests and virtual guests. Tracy took a stunning photo focused on my husband and I within the camera view of a friend's phone. We loved that the picture didn’t have us in focus as we were standing right there, but instead focused on our image on the phone screen. It really highlighted a special addition to our wedding of using a virtual stream. We highly recommend Tracy to all couples, but especially those that are wanting timeless pictures that are not cliche.

Not only was Jill was flexible, responsive, and affordable, but she was also genuinely a pleasure to work with. She worked hard to help plan photo shoots leading up the wedding and worked for many hours the day-of to ensure that our wedding was well-photographed. I would highly recommend working with Jill - our pictures turned out amazing!

Jon came through big time! He went out of his way and delayed time with his family to come take photos of my house. He did a great job! Hard to find someone who has the level of excellence and commitment that Jon has, I'm lucky I found him! Thank you so very much Jon! Pamela Anderson, Crestwood Missouri
