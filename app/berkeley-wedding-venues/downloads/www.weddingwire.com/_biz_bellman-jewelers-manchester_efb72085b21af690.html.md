Beautiful Wedding Bands

We absolutely loved working with Victoria to design our wedding bands. My engagement ring is unique with many details on the side. Victoria was patient and realistic with me as I tried on various designs, and even requested a re-design of the custom ring we eventually ordered. Victoria took great care of my great-grandmother’s stone - from approximately 1900 - and incorporated it beautifully into my wedding band. She paired this special stone with numerous others of the same cut and clarity. She also easily scheduled our soldering appointment post-honeymoon to ensure all of my special diamonds are protected. We love our wedding bands and we are grateful to consider Bellman’s our forever jewelers!

Best place to customize rings at no additional cost! 

Milana at Bellmans helped my husband and I design the ring of my dreams! She ensured everything was perfect and was extremely responsive. Highly recommend- it was an amazing experience!!

Extremely helpful and very talented! 

Thank you so much to the staff at Bellman’s for everything from helping my husband find and design the perfect engagement ring for me, helping us select our wedding bands and for building/designing my wedding jewelry using pearls from my grandmother. We worked with Doreen, though the whole staff was personable and paid attention to every little detail. I would highly recommend Bellman’s to anyone looking for a personalized experience while shopping for fine jewelry or diamonds.

Customer for life!

We stumbled upon Bellman’s while looking for a wedding ring for me and we’re so pleasantly surprised. Alex helped design me a custom ring to fit perfectly with my engagement ring. He was so helpful and nice to work with. I have already gone back to purchase other jewelry and will definitely be returning again and again!

Huge selection, beautiful work and helpful staff

My husband used Bellmans for my engagement ring, any jewelry he’s ever bought me and we bought our wedding rings there as well. Everyone is super helpful and there’s a huge selection of jewelry to choose from.

Will only buy jewelry from Bellmans!

Alex and the staff at Bellmans have been amazing to work with! My fiancé told him what he was looking for and that I work in healthcare and Alex knew exactly how to guide him. Him and his staff have been so helpful and accommodating from helping my husband pick out my engagement ring, to helping us find the perfect weddings bands, to helping me pick out the perfect gifts for my moms and sister, and even helping my husband surprise me with a beautiful necklace on our wedding day. What’s even more fitting is that my mothers engagement ring is also from Bellmans almost 30 years ago! If you’re looking for an honest business to help you find stunning jewelry for the price it’s actually worth, go to Bellmans and they will take care of you. Alex and team, thanks again for everything!!! Much love, Risa and Connor :)
