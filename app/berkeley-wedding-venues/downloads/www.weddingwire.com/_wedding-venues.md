## Wedding Venues

You’re engaged – now what?

Now you get to find your dream wedding venue, where you and your partner will walk down the aisle and host your wedding reception. Once you decide on your venue, you can begin planning the rest of your special day. 

When it comes to wedding venues, it’s a matter of narrowing down what kind of atmosphere you are looking for. Inside or outdoors? Big space or something intimate? Rustic or elegant? The choice is yours. With so many kinds of wedding venues available, you’re sure to find the perfect place to say “I do.”

## Picking a Wedding Venue

Choosing a wedding venue for your reception and ceremony tends to be the first step in the wedding planning process. Wedding venues are typically booked 1-2 years in advance, though some only need a few months’ notice. It all depends on the type of venue and your personal criteria. When in doubt, book as soon as possible so you have the best chance of securing your dream venue.

Anything can be a venue, from backyards to banquet halls, so be creative. Some questions to ask yourself before searching: are you looking for venues that can accommodate a large event, or a more intimate affair? Do you see yourself saying “I do” in your place of worship, or with sand between your toes? Walk down the aisle surrounded by nature or exchange your vows indoors. Whatever you and your partner have in mind, there’s a good chance you can find it, as other venue options include hotels, farms, restaurants, mansions, government buildings and inns.

Don’t forget that you’ll need a place to host your wedding ceremony and your wedding reception. Some couples have both in the same location, while others choose separate venues. Celebrate your wedding outdoors and then move to a banquet hall on-site or meet everyone on the dance floor at a nearby hotel or restaurant. There are no rules when it comes to planning your wedding, so allow yourself the creativity to make your wedding as unique as you.

There are some things to consider when choosing a venue. Set up a visit before you book, as pictures and reviews can only tell you so much. Also, don’t be afraid to ask questions. You’ll want to know how many people the venue can accommodate, what dates are available and how much the venue costs. The more you know, the easier it will be to make a decision.

## Outdoor Wedding Venue Spaces

Parks, gardens, farms and waterfront areas create the perfect backdrop for an intimate [outdoor](https://www.weddingwire.com/shared/search?group_id=1&page=1&userSearch=1&faqs\[\]=1100601704&faqs\[\]=1100601705&currentPickedMonth=202001) wedding. Get hitched on a dock overlooking a river or get married in a vineyard at sunset.

When choosing an outdoor venue, be aware of the weather. Getting married on the [beach](https://www.weddingwire.com/beach-weddings)? Prepare a backup plan for summer storms. Remind your guests to wear sandals or forego shoes altogether, and wear light clothes to stay cool. On the other hand, if you plan on getting married in the fall or winter, layers and warmer clothes are a must.

Many states have “four seasons in an hour” weather, which can be hard to predict, especially if you're getting married away from home. Do proper research before finalizing a venue. Keep track of the weather in the weeks leading up to your big day. Know that the weather will not make or break the day, so don't let it stress you too much.

If it's an outdoor wedding venue, find out what isn't provided and what you will need to bring with you. Some parks have pavilions and bathrooms, but nowhere to store food for the reception. Find out if you'll need to bring chairs or tables and what will be needed for additional decorations. Think about the time of day that you want to be married and how that may affect lighting for photography.

## Indoor Wedding Spaces

Prefer to get married with a roof over your heads? You’ll come across all kinds of [indoor](https://www.weddingwire.com/shared/search?group_id=1&page=1&userSearch=1&faqs\[\]=1100601703&currentPickedMonth=202003) wedding venues, from extravagant mansions to fascinating museums. Of course, country clubs, banquet halls and [hotels](https://www.weddingwire.com/hotel-weddings) are always an option, too.

There are also things to consider when choosing an indoor wedding location. In addition to finding out if the venue location is available on your desired date, you should also look into whether it is a convenient location for your guests. Can it hold everyone? Is there enough parking? Are there enough bathrooms? Is it climate controlled? These are all important things to note before making the final decision to book a venue.

## Taking the Next Step

Deciding on a wedding venue is the first step in turning your wedding vision into a reality. It is meant to be fun and exciting. Here at WeddingWire, we have a quick and easy way to find and compare wedding venues in a snap. If you’re asking yourself, “Where are the best wedding venues near me?” We’ll help you find them. Looking for a destination wedding instead? No sweat. Just enter the desired zip code or city and state to see a full list of wedding venues in the local area of your choice. Wherever you wind up hosting your wedding, you and your partner are destined to have one of the most memorable days of your lives.
