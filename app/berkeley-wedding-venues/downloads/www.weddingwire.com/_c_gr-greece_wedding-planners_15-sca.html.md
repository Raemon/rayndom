Choosing Eleni as our wedding planner was truly one of the best decisions we made for our entire celebration. From the very first call, her warm energy, enthusiasm, and genuine willingness to listen made us feel instantly connected. She took the time to deeply understand our vision, our cultural backgrounds, and our needs — and she supported us all the way. Planning a wedding from abroad can be challenging, but with Eleni we felt completely safe, supported, and confident that everything would be executed perfectly. Her experience with couples living outside Greece was invaluable; even if we couldn’t always be physically present, she made the entire journey smooth, organized, and stress-free. Eleni is incredibly professional, knowledgeable, and always ready to find solutions. Her organizational skills are exceptional, and her eye for floral design is truly on another level. The quality of everything she delivered was amazing. We collaborated with her for both our Nigerian ceremony and our Greek wedding, and she embraced every detail of both events with respect and professionalism. She always offered personal suggestions while making sure our wishes and preferences were at the center of every decision. Eleni mas thank you for your positivity, your support, your energy, your passion, and for making our dream wedding come to life. We couldn’t have asked for a better partner in this journey. With love, Kelly

Planning a destination wedding initially felt totally overwhelming but from our very first meeting we felt at ease in their capable hands. Our day was truly a dream and there is no way it could have happened without Katharina and Spiros. They are an extremely professional, well-organized team with all of the Crete connections! They communicated with us in a timely fashion every step of the way, took care to work within our budget, and went above and beyond with many details that we hadn't even thought about. Our vision was brought to life in such a beautiful way. On the day of the wedding, they took excellent care of us and our guests- in particular when a family member had a medical event. They also helped us sort out a small snafu after the wedding that was no fault of their own. We are SO grateful and would recommend them to anyone!

I have to admit we were not sure about using a Wedding Planner BUT Donna was absolutely amazing! Donna was professional and friendly, very approachable and so knowledgeable (giving us tips and advice). She knows all the contacts personally and the day could not have gone better. It was perfect. You HAVE to choose her without a doubt.

We seriously couldn’t have asked for better wedding planners than Make Happy Memories as they exceeded every expectation we had. From day one, they were organized, responsive, and just really easy to work with. We worked closely with Sophia, and she was amazing — super professional but also so warm and calm, which made a huge difference during the whole process. Planning a destination wedding in Paros sounds stressful, but they made everything feel totally manageable. They handled all the logistics and details so we could actually enjoy being engaged instead of stressing over timelines and vendors. Our wedding was pretty intimate — just 50 of our closest friends and family — but we walked away feeling like every single guest truly had the time of their lives. The vibe, the flow of the day, everything just felt right. Thanks to Make Happy Memories, our wedding day was smooth, fun, and completely stress-free. We’d recommend them in a heartbeat to anyone!

We live in London uk and was very overwhelmed with how to start the wedding planning journey as I had no idea where to start!! I found Iliana and Athena and their response was so quick and friendly. They held my hand through the whole 18 months, and even with all my silly questions they were so kind. The communication was Second to none and on the day they were so helpful and a friendly face to nurture you through the day. To top it all they were not expensive at all but the service was AMAZING 🤩 Would 100% recommend anyone who is getting married in Greece.

Better late than never! We just celebrated our 2nd wedding anniversary, and we still reminisce about our wedding day from beginning to end—thanks to Nicole. She is hands down the best wedding planner in all of Athens. Seriously, don’t bother looking anywhere else because she will go above and beyond to bring your dream wedding to life. From the very beginning, Nicole was incredibly communicative and immediately understood the aesthetic we wanted for our wedding. She arranged private meetings with vendors, which allowed us to really envision how everything would come together on the big day. Any time a challenge came up, Nicole handled it with ease, coming up with immediate solutions and alternatives. On the wedding day itself, everything went perfectly. There wasn’t a single hiccup, and everything flowed smoothly. To this day, we still receive compliments from guests on how much they loved the wedding. If you would like a glimpse of how our wedding turned out, you can find it in the Athens Riviera highlights on the Mosaique Events Instagram page. Nicole’s work truly speaks for itself. Whether you’re a bride planning a destination wedding in Athens or living there locally, we can confidently say Nicole is the best of the best, and you won’t be disappointed. With love, Fam & Marina

From the moment we met Errika and Manolis, we knew we were in the safest, most loving hands to bring our wedding dreams to life. They didn’t just plan our day, they crafted a story, a celebration that felt like a perfect reflection of who we are as a couple. Every detail was infused with thoughtfulness and care, from the tiniest touches to the sweeping moments that took our breath away. Their ability to turn our ideas into a magical reality was nothing short of extraordinary, and they brought a sense of calm and joy to every step of the journey. On the day itself, they orchestrated everything with such grace and ease that we were free to simply bask in the love and happiness surrounding us. Thanks to e.m, our wedding wasn’t just a day, it was a beautiful memory that we’ll cherish forever. If you want your love story told with elegance, heart, and magic, look no further.

Maria planned our wedding in Ios, Greece and made every moment feel like a dream. From the very beginning, she was the calm, capable presence I didn’t know I needed and an incredible communicator who anticipated details before I could even think to ask. She went above and beyond to ensure everything ran flawlessly, coordinating vendors across time zones and making sure we were cared for with genuine warmth. Every single element — the florals, the timing, and the ambiance felt effortless and perfectly aligned with our vision. What stood out most was her heart. She didn’t just plan our wedding; she supported me through the entire journey. Her kindness, patience, and professionalism transformed what could have been stressful into something joyful and unforgettable. I can honestly say I don’t know what I would have done without her. Maria is a truly exceptional communicator — talented, organized, and full of grace. She was there every step of the way and helped make our wedding nothing short of magical. ✨ If you’re dreaming of a destination wedding and want someone who will make it feel effortless and full of heart, Maria is the planner you’ve been hoping for.

Katarina from Santorini My Wedding is truly exceptional! Planning a destination wedding from abroad can be overwhelming, but Katarina made the entire process seamless and stress-free. She is incredibly organized, attentive, and always followed up in a timely manner. From our first meeting, she understood our vision perfectly and brought it to life with flawless execution. Katarina went above and beyond in every detail — coordinating vendors, managing logistics, and ensuring everything flowed effortlessly on the big day. The pricing was transparent and affordable with no surprises. Working with her across countries was so easy; she’s responsive, professional, and genuinely cares about creating the perfect experience for her couples. Our wedding day was everything we dreamed of and more, thanks entirely to her dedication and expertise. If you’re planning a wedding in Santorini, I can’t recommend Katarina and Santorini My Wedding highly enough — you’ll be in the best hands imaginable!

Alexandra was the best wedding planner we could ever think of. She helped us plan every detail and was completely available for calls, emails, and messages in what I will call after office hours. My husband and I felt very special counting with her on our wedding day, she made sure everything happened flawlessly and every detail we planned showed up. Our guests were impressed with all the planning and for sure we will remember this day as one of the best days in our lives.
