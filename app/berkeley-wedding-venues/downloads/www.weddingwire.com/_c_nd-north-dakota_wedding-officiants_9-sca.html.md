Rev. Rob was our shining light of hope! Our wedding was rushed due to the health of my now father in law. A year ago he was in a coma, and we prepared for the worst. He came out weak and frail and we were unsure how much longer he would last. We threw a wedding together in less then a year, and 2 months before the wedding our officiant backed out, due to a family illness. We contacted Rev Rob and he agreed to do the service, in Moorhead, MN. From the first contact we had, I knew he was perfect. The ceremony made me cry the day I read it, and again when I said my vows at the ceremony. It was like he wrote it just for us, even though we had never met him! I am SOOOOOOO pleased with how Rev Rob handled the whole situation, how quick he was to respond to our needs and how wonderful and special the day was because of him. If I had to do it all over again, and had 3 years to plan instead of less then one, I still would have him officate. I WOULDN'T CHANGE A SINGLE THING! THANK YOU REV ROB!!!! Mr. and Mrs. Wade Eddy

Amber was a delight to work with! We opted to do a package with pre-marital counseling as well as having her officiate our wedding. I enjoyed that she used Prepare + Enrich for the pre-marital counseling, and I think it was nice to have a neutral third party to discussions my partner and I were already having as well as finding other solutions to issues. She was also a delight on the ceremony and so responsive via email + her check-ins. After our ceremony, we had several guests comment how much they loved the ceremony Amber wrote + commented on how soothing her voice was! I would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for an officiant!

James did an absolutely wonderful job with our wedding ceremony. He made sure to meet with us beforehand to understand what we wanted, and get acquainted. We really liked his easygoing personality! He wrote us a beautiful ceremony (I am Unitarian, and my husband is Lutheran). He and his partner, Jean, were helpful and provided ideas when asked. He is very knowledgeable about weddings and religion. At our Groom’s dinner, he did a ceremony rehearsal so everyone knew where to stand. All around wonderful service for the price he charges. Thank you, James!

Honestly I have no words for the amazing job Elsa and Javier did!!! If you want to have the best team to help you have the wedding of your dreams, look no further! People say “Team work makes the dream work” and they outdid themselves with it! And if you are thinking Day of coordination is just them being there for a little bit of help, this is not the case with LaTradition! From traveling to the venue 2 months before the big day, to helping with things you are not sure about, making your “day of” timeline to helping with anything on the big day before you even thought about it! You guys are truly amazing! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
