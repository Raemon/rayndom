Recently hired Wiktoria for a client’s wedding and she did such a fabulous job. She was responsive, professional, socialized with all the guests, and is a really talented artist. She is such a sweetheart and really went the extra mile to make sure everyone was happy. She even explained to me how she learned to get better at art which was nice of her. Can’t recommend her enough!!! 11/10

Having Jeffrey Hull as our live wedding painter was one of the best decisions we made for our big day. Watching him capture our celebration on canvas in real time was magical—not just for us, but for all of our guests who loved seeing the painting come to life throughout the evening. He is unbelievably talented, professional, and so thoughtful in how he incorporated the details that made our day unique. Now we have a stunning work of art that we’ll cherish forever. If you’re considering a live painter, Jeffrey is the one!

💘 Cody created a beautiful painting of the moment we first kissed after being announced as husband and wife and we are forever grateful! She did such an amazing job capturing our energy as individuals and as a couple - me and my family are still in awe of how much our painting looks exactly like us! Even down to the henna on my hand! She did an exquisite job of amplifying the greenery and the lighting to make our painting look even more whimsical than it did in the pictures! Not to mention we had the microphone of the officiant and a fence in the background but Cody was able to edit and bring together the most perfect image that was free of any noise and clutter! She also framed our picture so beautifully! She was professional, reliable, and communicative. She worked along our vision and added a touch of her magic. I highly recommend you hire Cody to capture a magical moment at your wedding in a way that only she can. 💘

They are extremely professional and kind. They answered all the questions I had. And we’re even willing to work with all of the small details that I wanted to incorporate on her special day.

Julia was truly one of my favorite vendors at my wedding. We got married at the beginning of this month down the shore. We wanted to have special things for our guests at our wedding and wanted to do something more unique than a photo booth - something they might actually keep! I'm SO happy we went with Julia's talent for creating beautiful sketches of our guests. All of the people who got them were so thrilled, honestly they still haven't stopped talking about it and they all have told me they can't wait to frame them. She was such a pro and even went around and let guests know she was there, took their photos ahead of time so there was never a line back up at her table and was able to create so many beautiful works of art that really rounded out our day. Fabulous, would absolutely recommend her to anyone getting married anytime soon and want their guests remembering their wedding for a long time!!

I could not recommend Artviva more!! The entire process leading up to the wedding was seamless. The day of, Angelis made sure we had so much fun, many options to choose from, and a vision we were confident and comfortable with. Throughout the reception we saw the painting come to life, and the everyone who saw it was absolutely floored. When we received our painting it was better than we could have ever imagined. It is a piece we will treasure forever and are so grateful for Angelis’ beautiful work!!

Eternal Flower Paintings created a painting of my wedding bouquet that has helped me relive my magical wedding every single day when I walk by it. Flowers may die, but like the love in my marriage, the painting of my wedding bouquet will never die and will continue to live on in this magnificent piece of art. I am forever grateful for this piece that I proudly display in my home.

The day after my wedding I was in a panic as I didn't think about my bouquet until I picked it up from the venue. In a panic I looked for floral preservation. Found some companies on Etsy I would have to ship out of state. Looked for someone in NJ and found B Creative. Brittany was so accommodating with my last minute order. I got to see some of the size options in person and went with a 10x10 Square. I just dropped it off and it takes a couple months to make but I am so excited. All the in store keepsakes were absolutely stunning! Highly recommend!

My husband and I loved having the mobile cigar lounge at our wedding. Our guests loved it!!! The owners were so communicative and easy to work with. I highly recommend using the mobile cigar lounge at your wedding. It’s very much worth it!!
