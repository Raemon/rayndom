We had the incredible fortune of working with Reseda and Chanya for our wedding in Barbados and I cannot recommend their services highly enough. With less than two months to plan everything, we were understandably anxious about pulling off our dream wedding smoothly. From our first meeting Reseda assured me that everything would be taken care of and they certainly delivered beyond our expectations. Every detail from the venue arrangeents to the decor and coordinating with vendors and day of coordination was executed flawlessly. Their expertise and meticulous plannig ensured that our day flowed smoothly and allowed us to relax and enjoy every moment with our loved ones. If you're looking for event planning/decor that will go above and beyond to make your vision a reality look no further!

We had to give 5 stars for this review to be at the top otherwise it gets buried in 2018 with her other bad reviews. All her "great" reviews are clearly fake or from friends and all in 2020 so nothing until 2024 when we had the misfortune of choosing this appalling "service". We deeply regret choosing Leigh of *Events by Leigh* as our wedding planner. This was by far the most unprofessional, unreliable, and dishonest experience we have ever encountered. I am genuinely surprised that this individual operates as a "wedding planner." **Key points (if you don’t want to read further): ** \- Leigh failed to attend a scheduled appointment to take us to obtain our marriage license, a service we had already paid for. \- The day before our wedding, she informed us she would not be attending and left us to handle (order) the flowers, table, and chairs ourselves. We booked Leigh based on her "elopement package" as we were having a small wedding and needed assistance with local procedures, particularly in obtaining the marriage license and securing a minister. My partner initially spoke with Leigh as I couldn’t be present, but fortunately, we had already arranged the venue, leaving mostly floral and logistical details to discuss with her. Our main concern was ensuring the paperwork, license, and minister were properly arranged. Thankfully, we had a simple approach, as relying on Leigh for a larger event would have been disastrous. After we had booked and paid for her services, communication with Leigh became a serious issue. My emails regarding flower arrangements were met with delayed responses, and when she did reply, her tone was cold and unhelpful. Despite sending her reference images and requesting guidance on alternatives, her replies were both dismissive and slow—often taking over a week. With less than two weeks to go before the wedding, I received no further responses from her. Emails were bouncing back, and we were left thinking it had been a scam. When we finally managed to reach her through another email address, she blamed her assistant's absence for the lack of communication—an excuse that became a recurring theme. It was always someone else’s fault. Leigh even divulged personal details about her assistant’s situation, which was both unnecessary and unprofessional. One of the most critical failures was when Leigh failed to show up for our scheduled appointment to obtain our marriage license. We had arranged and paid for her to pick us up at 10:20 a.m. (the appointment was at 11) but by 10:27, there was no sign of her. When we called, she casually responded as if unaware of the appointment, then claimed she was at another engagement. She hung up and didn’t call us back with the address or any reassurance about us now being late for an important appointment. We were therefore left to arrange our own transport to Bridgetown, all while she held the necessary paperwork. When we did call her back Leigh remained unapologetic and dismissive, even suggesting we should have driven ourselves. Later, she blamed her extended appointment for her absence, but we were never offered any genuine explanation or apology for her negligence. She refused to reimburse the cost of the taxi saying it was our decision to take one. That evening we sent a polite email requesting a call to go over logistics, as we were understandably concerned. Leigh's response came late Sunday night, where she informed us she now wouldn’t be attending the wedding, citing that we were having a "no frills" event and implying her presence wasn’t necessary. This was completely false, as we had never communicated any such thing. Moreover, she mentioned multiple excuses, including diary issues and miscommunication with her assistant—none of which aligned with the facts of our previous conversations. She also said the apt for obtaining the licence was a mere business transaction and she didn’t know why we were so frantic. Plus, she could not be held responsible for other people’s emotional responses. Adding to the above it transpired that Leigh had not arranged the flowers or the necessary tables and chairs, leaving us to try and find replacements with less than 24 hours until the wedding. Despite her claim that she had ordered the flowers, we discovered from the florist that no such order had been placed. In fact, her failure to pick us up for the license appointment seemed to serve as a catalyst for her later cancellation, raising serious doubts about her credibility. To make matters worse, we received a call from the minister a week later, requesting payment—a service we had already paid Leigh for. Additionally, she had said she would charge us $150 for delivering the marriage certificates, a service the minister confirmed was included in his cost and was only an extra $20. Overall, our experience with Events by Leigh was appalling. Leigh demonstrated a serious lack of professionalism, responsibility, and respect for her clients. Planning a wedding can be a stressful time, and hiring a planner should help alleviate that stress, not add to it. Leigh’s actions had the opposite effect. We cannot recommend Events by Leigh to anyone seeking a reliable, trustworthy wedding planner. If you're planning an event, I strongly urge you to seek a professional who values clear communication, accountability, and commitment to their clients.

Tamisha from Stridz Events was absolutely incredible to work with! From our very first phone call, I knew I could trust her with my vision, and she delivered beyond anything I could have ever imagined. She is so detail-oriented and truly has an eye for creating beauty. Both my wedding ceremony and reception were absolutely stunning. the décor was elegant, thoughtful, and exceeded every expectation I had. Tamisha and her team made the entire process stress-free, and I felt completely confident in their hands. I would 100% recommend Stridz Events to any bride or groom looking for a team that will bring their dream destination wedding to life!

THE BEST! Shari and Shelley are my newest best friends, whether they want to be or not We really bonded throughout the planning process and the Click Wed team made my wedding day dreams come true. From our first conversations, before any contracts were signed, Shari provided a wealth of helpful information and researched various venues our behalf. This proved that she was not about the money, but that event planning is her true passion and she gives of her time, expertise, and energy wholeheartedly when working with any bride and groom. Our wedding day was sheer perfection. We could not have asked for a better experience. If only we could get married again and again and again just to work with Click Wed again!

I highly recommend KrisAsha Company for any event or floral needs in Barbados. Kris exceeded all expectations with her professionalism, transparency, and attention to detail. She worked within our $70K budget for a 130-guest garden wedding, providing clear communication, stunning florals, and thoughtful touches like a beach picnic tasting and surprise fireworks. Every detail was flawless, from budgeting to execution. Kris made planning stress-free over 16 months, ensuring our day was perfect. I’ll definitely use her again!
