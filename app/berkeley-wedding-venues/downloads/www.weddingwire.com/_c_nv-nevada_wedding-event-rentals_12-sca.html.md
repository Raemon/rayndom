I loved the rentals we got from Camelot! They generally met all of our expectations with everything delivered on time and all emails responded to quickly. The only complaint I would have is that many of their tables seemed to be on their last leg (pun intended) and were a bit flimsy and/or had masking tape holding them together. None or our guests noticed so it ended up being okay, but it had us a little worried!

Shade Shifters exceeded all of my expectations. I had an outdoor wedding in Truckee, California with uneven ground. That was no problem for this crew! They were timely, flexible, and made it so easy I did not have to worry about a thing. Plus the tent looked stunning, way better than those stock tents. And man was that tent sturdy! It ended up snowing three inches for my June wedding and the tent didn't falter. Thank you Shade Shifters for making my wedding! I would highly recommend them to anyone.

I would reccomend Margarita Man to anyone having any sort of party, and will be using them again for sure. The machines are just like a slurpy machine, only they have margaritas. Perfect for our July wedding and they were so easy and convenient. They drop them off, pick them up, and take care of the cleaning.

RSVP Party Rentals elevated our wedding reception with 2 black Luna bars and a 20x20 white dance floor, adding a touch of elegance to the atmosphere. Their professional, on-time service and excellent communication made the rental process hassle-free. With an lots of cool and unique rentals to choose from, we highly recommend RSVP Party Rentals—10/10!

DBD does beautiful work for weddings. We got married at the Crimson in the red rock resort in Las Vegas. They decked it out with beautiful flowers (real and fake), they did beautiful table decor, and they put up green hedge walls to block out the other pool so we could have privacy for our event. They had me come to their warehouse a few weeks before the wedding to have me look over the table decor setup. They listened to all of my wants and concerns. They genuinely care about what you want as a couple and not just about their design wants. We wanted a unique diamond shape altar and they built it for us. We had an issue with a hedge wall being knocked over by a gust of wind and knocking over a guest (he was fine thank goodness). The vice president of the company personally called us the next day to apologize for the incident. That meant a lot to me. Overall, we were very pleased with our wedding decor.

We worked with Krista from EventMasters, and she was wonderful. We changed our orders on her so many times, and she was the epitome of patience (although I wouldn't be surprised if she was secretly yelling at us every time we sent her a new email). The rentals all arrived on time, were unloaded in a quick manor (although we did have to carry all the chairs ourselves because the truck couldn't go up the hill, I wish the men could have at least helped us), and were picked up effortlessly. Krista was great, and I would definitely work with her again.

I love this company! They are fair in price and surprised me with how quickly they got back to me when I had questions. The actual tent was beautiful and far exceeded my expectations. I would recommend this Alpine to everybody.
