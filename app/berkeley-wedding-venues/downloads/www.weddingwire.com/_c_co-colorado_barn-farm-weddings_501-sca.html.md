We took a leap of faith with this venue owner as one of the first couples to book, and we are so glad we did! Everything came together with the help of Kimberlie and made our special day smooth and wonderful. Couldn't recommend this venue more!

The most amazing wedding venue! Darla, Jim, and his team were absolutely incredible. The venue was gorgeous and exactly what we were looking for. We knew right away it was perfect for us. The front range view, the beautiful landscaping, and the indoor rustic reception site were marvelous. From all of the wedding details, we probably received the most compliments on how gorgeous our venue was, so you cannot go wrong. It helped so much to have so many elements included and taken care of- coordinator, tables and chairs, table cloths, napkins, bartender, servers, the arch, and many of the decorations. I didn't even feel the need to have a florist included in the day because of the landscaping and natural elements that were already part of Shupe. That helped a ton! We loved the feeling of being doted on and feeling so special and taken care of. A DEEP heart felt thank you to Shupe and the At Your Service Event Management Team. You make dreams come true!!

Our experience with Wedgewood was unbelievably fabulous. I genuinely didn’t think that any kind of event planning could be so streamlined and attentive. My now-husband and I aren’t exactly flush with free time. Wedgewood worked with our schedule, which was invaluable. The venue, planning, and the day-of team truly made my dreams come true. The venue: my husband and I are both from Colorado & it was a perfect opportunity to provide our guests with a slice of Colorado. Mountainview Ranch was about an hour away from our home outside of Denver, tucked into the mountains far enough to offer stunning geological landscapes and forests and close enough to ensure no one gets lost or carsick on their way. We chose the lakeview location, as it offered the suite of cabins for our guests. Lakeview itself is gorgeous. The bridal & groom suites are roomy & comfortable, the ceremony space is beyond perfect, and the big hall and expansive decks offer stunning views. We went with all of their included/recommended vendors, and all crushed it! Coordination: we toured the venue with Alex, who was awesome. She answered all our (many) questions and sat down with us to discuss what pricing and budgeting looks like. Obviously, as an all-inclusive venue, it’s not an extreme-budget option, but the package cost compared to my estimation of a non-inclusive/DIY version of the same wedding was VASTLY more affordable AND included all the legwork done by experienced professionals. There were 3 main meetings, 6 months, 6 weeks, & ten days out. All were productive and painless. Our coordinator, Caryn, was a true blessing. Patient, funny, detail-oriented, & kind: we never felt rushed or pressured with her. She was on top of everything! I spent my wedding prep time doing fun little DIYs instead of needing to coordinate. The Day-Of: Another shout-out to Caryn, who gracefully guided our listening-challenged family through every step of the process, herded the wedding party to where we needed to be, and answered questions for me. She also ensured my husband and I remained fed and watered, which was vital! The ceremony was beautifully managed. Caryn delivered us food in the bridal suite after the ceremony, and even managed to snap a beautiful photo of our dip kiss, print it, and put it framed on our sweetheart table before we sat down for dinner. A magical woman, truly. Our banquet team also killed it: our captain Mikayla ensured the buffet went off without a hitch. Mikayla also carefully packed us each a meal, complete with appetizers & dessert, which we treasured the day after the wedding when we got home to an empty fridge. The rest of the banquet team, Christy, Tyler, Callie, Maddie, and Nate truly lit up our service with their smiles and assistance. They were all SO helpful, kind, and enthusiastic. I received several comments on how happy they were to lend a hand. Finally: a special shout out to the photobooth, which I worried might be a little over-played. People LOVED it, and it allowed guests to select how many copies they wanted printed. It was delightful. We are genuinely floored. I cannot believe it was as good as it was: it felt like a dream. I got so many compliments on the venue and the wedding and the food (and everything else!!), and so many people marveled at how seamless and fun an event it was. It was all Wedgewood! I feel like all we had to do was show up! I am absolutely patting myself on the back for choosing Wedgewood (& especially Mountainview).

A truly unforgettable and GORGEOUS place to get married! We couldn’t have dreamed of a more beautiful backdrop than the TL7 for our wedding. With the beautiful mountains all around you, their ceremony meadow feels like a fairy tale. Plus, the ranch is at the base of the Maroon Bells!!! All guests from locals to out-of-towners who have never been to Aspen before will fall in love with the area. Highly recommend the lodge!! The TL7 has a fantastic team who is down to earth and so supportive of making the day as fun as it can possibly be.

Our wedding at 4 Eagle Ranch was absolutely beautiful! We highly recommend this location- the wedding deck is incredibly pretty with a mountain range behind it, green grassy rolling hills with the ranches horses roaming, and a pond that offers a beautiful reflection. The reception area is big and open, with beautiful views as well. There are so many things for guests to do so no one was board at all! The staff was attentive and kind.

I could not have asked for a better wedding venue. Starting with our tour of the venue, Kate showed us the entire venue and answered any questions we had. Once we put our deposit down, she sent us a complete timeline of when every single thing was due and checked in on us frequently to make sure we were doing okay and if to see we had any questions. A part of our dream wedding was to have our dog in it, and was a big reason we chose sylvan dale. He was able to be at our ceremony, dinner (sitting with us), reception, and slept overnight with us in our cabin. He was even on the dance floor with us during our reception. This venue made it so much less stressful for us as so many vendors were included, the venue included food, bartender, linens, etc. The only vendors we ended up getting were a photographer and dj. The only con we did have throughout the day is that some of the cabins for guests were not ready at 3 and with our ceremony being at 4, some of our guests were almost late to our ceremony because they weren’t able to change/ finish getting ready in their cabin. I grew going horseback riding here and the staff has always been amazing. I will always recommend sylvan dale ranch whether it’s for horseback riding, fly fishing, special occasions, or holidays. Our wedding just intensified my love for this venue even more.

We got married here in September, and I truly don’t have enough words to describe how perfect everything was. From start to finish, the entire experience was seamless, beautifully organized, and genuinely magical. The setting itself is breathtaking – Colorado in September gave us golden sunlight, crisp air, and the most stunning natural backdrop we could have hoped for. But what truly made the day unforgettable was the team behind it all. Every single person we worked with went above and beyond to make us feel special, supported, and stress-free. You could tell they genuinely cared and took pride in what they do. The attention to detail, the thoughtful touches, and the smooth coordination allowed us to be fully present and soak in every moment. Our guests are still talking about how beautiful and well-executed everything was! If you're looking for a place where your wedding day will feel not only magical but also truly yours, I can't recommend this location enough. It was the best decision we made, and we’ll cherish the memories forever.

The best wedding venue ever! We got married at Meadow Creek Lodge this June and it was everything we could have hoped for - absolutely perfect in every way. The setting is stunning, full of charm and warmth, and Aja and her team went above and beyond to make our day unforgettable. They handled every detail with such care and kindness, creating a relaxed, joyful atmosphere where we could truly soak in every moment. We can’t imagine a more magical place to get married!
