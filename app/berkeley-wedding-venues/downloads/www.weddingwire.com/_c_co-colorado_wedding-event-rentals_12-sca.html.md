Look no further for your rental needs! All Events rentals has the best rentals for a reasonable price. They were quick to respond and easy to work with. Since my wedding was on a Sunday, they let me pick up the rentals a day before and drop it off the day after for no extra fee and no travel fee! I highly recommend using them!

I had the absolute privilege of working with Aemilia via CECE, as my wedding planner and coordinator after winning her planning services in a giveaway, and I still can’t believe how lucky I was. From start to finish, she went above and beyond in every possible way. Aemilia was incredibly supportive during our pre-wedding meetings, always organized, patient, and full of thoughtful ideas. She provided amazing planning guides and helpful tools that made the whole process feel so much less overwhelming. Every detail I hadn’t even thought of, she had covered. On the day of the wedding, she was truly phenomenal. Calm, confident, and completely on top of everything. Our wedding would not have run as smoothly (or been as stress-free!) without her. I cannot recommend Aemilia enough. If you are considering hiring her, do it, you’ll be so grateful you did!

There is no better team than Sperry Tents Colorado. They are truly one of the best vendors in Colorado. As a local planner and recent bride, anytime I need a tent, even for my own wedding - Ryan and Warren are the first ones I call. They are flexible, professional and always, always willing to go the extra mile to help vendors and guests!

We had the loo for two days and split the cost with another bride. The company was responsive, great at splitting the bill, wonderful cleaning in between, and just as expected.

Event Rents was wonderful to work with from start to finish! Their staff was so friendly, helpful, and thorough, making the entire process of selecting our rentals a truly fun and enjoyable experience. They were incredibly flexible and accommodating with all the changes we had to make along the way, which made a huge difference during the busy planning process. The quality of their linens and tablescape items are outstanding — everything looked beautiful and added such a special touch to our wedding reception. The dropoff and pickup of the rentals was a seamless process as well. Event Rents truly helped bring our vision to life, and we’re so grateful for their professionalism and care. Highly recommend!

We used Bethel for our wedding rentals and tent rental the day after. The ordering process was easy—the girls in the office accommodated all my changes. Thanks Isabelle! The tent delivery staff were super kind, too. All the items were clean and in good condition. Highly recommended!

I contacted Colorado Party Rentals in Colorado Springs and worked with Vicky. She is a true expert! I made an appointment and met with her at their local showroom. She asked questions about things I hadn't even thought of yet and was super helpful in getting us what we needed for the number of guests we were having. She was also helpful in suggesting items that would match the vibe we were after. The terms of the contract were clearly explained, and it was easy to make modifications to my original order as needed. I ended up adding champagne flutes, adjusted numbers and sizes of plates, chairs and linens. The day before our wedding, delivery to our home went smoothly and the day after the wedding Colorado Party Rentals was there bright and early to pick everything up! I would definitely recommend Colorado Party Rentals!

Working with RC Special Events was amazing. We had a tent wedding out in Northern Longmont. They were great in helping identify the best tent for our needs as well as the various decorative options that would help transform the space like bistro lighting packages, cocktail rounds, ceremony seating, as well as the reception tables and seating. Consummate professionals, they were great. Would highly recommend.
