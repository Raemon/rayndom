Party Pro had the largest selection of rentals I think I've ever seen and they were the only ones we found that had enough of a color range to match the colors we chose for our wedding! Their showroom made it easy to visualize what all of the tables would look like at wedding and they looked beautiful! They made it very easy to tweak the amounts once we had our final count. I highly recommend Party Pros for any event, but especially for a wedding!

We were glad that our planner connected us with Mood for our rentals. We were appreciative that Ashlee met with us on a couple of occasions to make sure that we were happy with our selections. We had to have the quote amended a few times, but don't see that as Mood's fault, and were given the updates in a timely manner. Everything we ordered was clean, wrinkle-free, and in good condition. We'd definitely recommend Mood to any couple that is planning their wedding and needs some simple, elegant options for their rentals.

I would highly recommend ABCO for any event you might have. They were very easy to work with, even when I changed what was needed a few times. They were prompt in delivering everything and very helpful in unloading. If you want to relieve some of the stress of your wedding day or any event, I recommend ABCO!

We hired Borrowed Charm because I was feeling overwhelmed by the thought of planning a wedding. Our planner, Sydney Lee, held my hand every step of the way and took so much stress off my shoulders. She is so sweet and easy to communicate with! And her vendor suggestions were phenomenal! Sydney saw my vision for our wedding and took it above and beyond my expectations. I almost cried my makeup off when I saw what they had done with the venue space. Everything was truly so beautiful and magical and more than I could’ve dreamed of. Sydney also did a great job keeping things on schedule throughout the ceremony and reception. She kept everyone on track and ensured we had a seamless and memorable event! I 100% recommend Borrowed Charm for your wedding planning and decor/rental needs! I genuinely could not have done it (physically or mentally) without Sydney and her team supporting me throughout the entire planning process and the event itself. Hiring Borrowed Charm was the best decision I made in planning our wedding!

We had a shabby chic wedding and the owner had everything you could imagine! We rented a large metal tub that we used for our bottled drinks and she provided these cute rustic drink dispensers. Her store is so cute and she has tons of inventory for great reasonable prices. She is a pleasure to work with!
