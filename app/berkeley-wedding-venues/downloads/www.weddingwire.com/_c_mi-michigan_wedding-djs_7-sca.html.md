We loved having Moments in Time as our DJ for our wedding! Desmond was our DJ who did our ceremony and reception - He did a phenomenal job understanding what we wanted for our wedding and definitely over delivered! We would recommend Moments in Time to any bride or groom looking for a team who is professional, has great communication and good vibes!! Thanks again DJ Desmond! :)

The crew at Bash Entertainment was amazing. Sean, Brooklen, Charlie, and Joe made it a night we will never forget! Special shoutout to DJ Joe Sabra with Bash Entertainment was amazing! He listened to our requests, adapted seamlessly to our timeline, and made our wedding unforgettable. The uplighting and monogram on the wall was to die for! Highly recommend him to anyone looking for the perfect DJ!

Sky and Dennis were amazing! They made our special day a complete success and were so flexible when things came up that none of us were expecting. I am so grateful they were in charge of the photography and DJ services. Dennis was incredibly out-going and did an amazing job keeping the guests engaged and interested. When many of my guests were leaving towards the end of the night, Dennis kept the party going while we cleaned up and it was like I had my own private DJ dance session for those last few songs. He brought these light up wands that the kids were over-the-moon about, and everyone had a blast waving them around on the dance floor. Sky did an absolutely fantastic job with the photos! She truly has an amazing gift with photography. She captured everything I wanted and then some! We were not a very organized bridal party, and I even had a groomsman and bridesmaid arrive late, but Sky kept rolling with the punches. She had quick thinking and somehow captured so much joy in every single photo. I am so grateful I chose Complete Wedding and Events and I will continue to recommend them to others in the future! Thank you so much!

From the moment I first spoke to Steve, I knew I had found the right DJ for us. I was a covid bride and had to reschedule our wedding and Steve was wonderful through the whole process. Every time I sent an email to him or gave him a call, he made me feel like I was his most important client each and every time. He truly listens to his customers and takes their concerns and requests seriously. Steve also has a planner that he asks couples to fill out and it’s so thorough and helpful, it was wonderful and made planning so much easier! He is organized, punctual, and truly is just a wonderful person. By the time my wedding rolled around, I felt like he was an old friend, and I will always be grateful for his help and kindness during such a stressful time. I gave Steve a ‘do not play’ list and a ‘please play’ list, and he followed those perfectly and even was happy to let me make mix tape for our dinner music, which brought me so much joy on our wedding day! Steve was also very dedicated to pronouncing everyone’s name correctly in my wedding party, and some of them were not easy, but Steve got each and every one correct! There were a few last-minute changes to things and Steve rolled with them and took the stress out of the situation every time I had to bring a change up to him, again, we were so grateful. For example, my venue forgot to put out table numbers for him to dismiss tables for dinner, I felt awful and scrabbled to tell him and apologize for their oversight, Steve just smiled and said he was already handling it and would be dismissing tables by physically walking up to our guests and letting them know it was their turn. That kind of service and adaptability is unfortunately rare, and out of all of my vendors, Steve was the one that I just knew I could count on, and that is priceless on your wedding day. He kept people on the dance floor and even after our wedding, we heard from multiple people how great our music was! We also hired Steve for our photo booth, and we were not disappointed! The booth was awesome and spacious to fit in multiple people and there were so many wonderful props it was hard to choose! The book we received afterwards is something we will always cherish! I cannot recommend Music Unlimited, and all their services, highly enough. You will not regret hiring this company, they are so dedicated to making your vision for your wedding day a reality!

Matt was very knowledgeable and helpful from the time we booked him to the date of our wedding! He met with us over zoom twice before our wedding to go over all the details and answer any questions we had. Our guests thought he was very entertaining and we really enjoyed his package that included bridal party introductions and a summary of our love story!

EDIT: After speaking with the Photography Director, Krista Smith, I would like to update my review. Krista was sincerely apologetic when reviewing the gallery photos with me and has gone above and beyond to rectify the situation. She is making every effort to create a wedding album that we can truly enjoy and cherish. While unfortunate, I believe our experience with the photographer was an isolated incident and not reflective of the company’s overall standard or typical service. Though we cannot get that day back, I’m grateful that the team is doing everything they can to make it right. ORIGINAL POST First, I want to acknowledge and commend DJ Dustin—he was absolutely phenomenal. He kept the energy high, the dance floor full, and was a true highlight of the evening. Unfortunately, our experience with the photographer was deeply unsatisfactory. The majority of our photos show us squinting, and when the venue coordinator suggested relocating due to the lighting, the photographer declined. This decision significantly affected the quality of our pictures. Most heartbreaking of all, our wedding party consisted of our four children (ages 13 to 22), as this day marked the union of our two families. Shockingly, not a single usable photo of the six of us together was captured. Even the curated photo gallery that was presented to us did not include any of our family portraits. This lack of attention to such a meaningful detail is extremely disappointing and frankly unacceptable. Additionally, the photo booth attendant was kind, but the printer malfunctioned throughout the night. This resulted in delays, missing prints, and guests having to walk away without leaving messages. Some of the guestbook entries even have mismatched photos next to them due to the printing issues. I’m not someone who expects perfection or makes unreasonable demands. I am a simple person who hoped for a smooth, memorable day. Sadly, our experience with the photographer, left us with lasting regret. I would strongly advise against hiring him, and if he is the only option available, I would recommend reconsidering.

We had an amazing experience with Pro DJ Services! They created a beautiful custom image with my husband’s and my initials for us to project at our wedding, and it added such a special, personal touch to the night. Jason designed the image, came out to set everything up, and took it down afterward — it was truly the easiest and most seamless process. We have always had wonderful experiences with Pro DJ Services. I’ve worked with many of their DJs over the years, and they never disappoint. They are professional, reliable, and they always know how to bring the party! I can’t recommend them enough. -Hayley & Mike Eismann 10.3.25
