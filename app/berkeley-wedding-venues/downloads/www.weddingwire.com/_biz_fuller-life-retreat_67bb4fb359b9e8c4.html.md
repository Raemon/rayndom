Welcome to **Fuller Life Retreat** —a 68-acre private estate wrapped around a 50-acre spring-fed lake, nestled just outside the city yet worlds away from ordinary. Once a quiet nunnery, this sacred land now welcomes couples to celebrate love in its purest form: surrounded by nature, stillness, and storybook beauty.

Winding forest trails, open meadows, a quaint red shed that feels like a barn straight out of a painting, garden paths, fire circles, and a Spanish-style stucco home with arched doorways and sun-kissed patios—it’s all here. Each corner of the property offers a **different backdrop** , allowing your wedding to unfold like a film, scene by sacred scene.

Couples choose Fuller Life because it feels different. The energy here is **intentional**. It's peaceful, expansive, and alive with possibility. Whether you're eloping on the overlook with the lake behind you, hosting a tented reception under the stars, or planning a full weekend celebration with overnight guests, this is more than a venue—it’s an experience.

At Fuller Life, we slow time. We hold space for love to be witnessed deeply. And we create room for you to fully inhabit the beginning of your forever.

Fuller Life Retreat is a serene wedding venue nestled in the breathtaking natural surroundings of Grey Eagle, Minnesota.

The perfect spot for our special day! 

This was the most beautiful venue for our wedding. Everything from the serene nature, private lake, and gorgeous venue was perfect. I knew I wanted to get married in nature and this place was the perfect mix of nature and amenities. The home is a refurbished Montessori so had plenty of space (and bathrooms!) for our wedding party to stay and get ready. The state of the art kitchen made mornings and after ceremony snacks fun and easy. Richelle was a blessing and answered all our questions and met all of our needs with enthusiasm and precision. I loved every detail about this perfectly curated home and the vast nature and lake are perfect the way only nature is. Thank you so much Richelle! I have a feeling this special place will be a part of many future family vacations.

Beautiful Location! 

We got married at Fuller Life Retreat and it was everything we hoped for. The property is absolutely stunning—open fields, trees everywhere, and the most peaceful private lake. It felt super private and relaxed, like our own little world for the weekend.  
  
There are so many cool spots on the property—an overlook for the ceremony, a red barn-looking shed, gardens, the bunkhouse tucked under the trees. Every part of it felt special and made for amazing photos. Our guests kept saying how beautiful and peaceful it was.  
We stayed overnight and loved waking up surrounded by nature. It felt like a retreat, not just a wedding. If you’re looking for something that’s not cookie-cutter and really lets you have your day your way, this is it.
