The best decision i made!

Everyone at my August 2025 wedding kept asking how I found these incredible musicians!! Scott and Rosanna are beyond talented, kind, genuine, and easy to work with. They helped me incorporate special songs into several parts of the day. Their equipment was top-notch and everything sounded great!   
  
For my wedding at Succop Nature Park in Butler, PA, they provided instrumental guitar for the pre-ceremony, played selected songs for the ceremony, performed during cocktail hour, performed alongside a saxophonist for dinner hour, and stayed to play the dance floor playlist through their speakers! They also helped with MC services on top of all of that! Seamless execution.  
  
I cannot recommend working with these two lovely folks enough! They are warm, friendly and professional. So happy I found them and booked for my wedding!! THANK YOU.

Scott & Rosanna Made Our Wedding Feel Like a Dream

We truly cannot express how grateful we are to have had Scott and Rosanna be part of our wedding day. From start to finish, working with them was an absolute dream. They were kind, professional, and so easy to communicate with throughout the planning process. Every detail was thoughtfully discussed, and we felt completely confident that the music would be everything we hoped for—and it was even more than that.  
  
Scott and Rosanna’s singing during our pre-ceremony at the Catholic church was absolutely incredible. As guests arrived hearing their voices fill the church, it created a peaceful, emotional, and truly special atmosphere that set the perfect tone for the ceremony. It was truly heartfelt from the very start. Even now, our guests are still talking about how amazing it was to walk into the church with their beautiful music in the background. They also went above and beyond by learning and performing two special songs for our mothers and bridesmaids to walk down the aisle, and they did it flawlessly—it meant so much to us.  
  
But the moment that truly took our breath away was our first dance. They performed “I Can’t Help Falling in Love” live, and it was absolutely magical. Their voices brought so much emotion and intimacy to the moment—what could have been just a beautiful song became an unforgettable experience that we (and many of our guests) will remember forever.  
  
If you’re looking for musicians who are not only incredibly talented but also an absolute joy to work with, look no further. Booking them will be one of the best decisions you make for your wedding. They helped make our day feel deeply personal, meaningful, and completely unforgettable.

Awesome Performers

Scott and Rosanna were a special treat for our wedding celebration. We booked them for two hours and had them singing during cocktail hour and beginning part of dinner. What a treat and delightful music that works well in the background or center stage. They were very easy to deal with. We loved the variety of their music selections and the performance is top notch - you will not be disappointed! I also believe they are very fairly priced. We would not hesitate to hire this couple again.

They helped make our wedding magical, and I hope they can make your event just as great!

We were so lucky to have Scott and Rosanna play at our wedding! I've known Scott and Rosanna for years, and have seen them play live many times. Rosana's voice is incredible, my wife and I have been fans of her singing for years.  
  
Our wedding was at the Carnegie Museum (The Music Hall Foyer and Hall of Sculpture)  
  
We had Scott and Rosanna play the pre-ceremony, ceremony, cocktail hour, and dinner hour. It was great to have a continuity of musicians between the ceremony and cocktail/dinner hour throughout the night. It was also convenient they were able to move their equipment from the Hall of Sculpture where the ceremony was to the Music Hall Foyer for cocktail hour/dinner. Rosanna was incredibly easy to work with the logistics of the day.  
  
My background is in music technology, and I am a little more sensitive to high-quality live sound systems than most people. I can say with confidence, that Scott's engineering of their sound system is phenomenal! They were able to fill the space with volume without being overbearing or a microphone feedback mess. They were able to self-level perfectly to both the Hall of Sculpture and the Music Hall Foyer with ease. When Scott handed the microphone out for speeches, I knew it was going to sound great to the audience. You can trust them for a high-quality sound.  
  
The highlight of my night was Rosanna going above and beyond and being willing to sing our first dance song with another band! We had a big band play for our reception. Rosanna sang a rendition of Everywhere by Fleetwood Mac while we had the multi-instrumentation big band play the music. Rosanna was very open and willing to work with another group and help achieve this unique experience for my wife and me.  
  
If you're looking for someone to play your event; You can't go wrong with Scott and Rosanna. They are truly some of the best in the area. They helped make our wedding magical, and I hope they can make your event just as great!

Highlight of our wedding! 

Scott and Rosanna were absolutely the highlight of our wedding reception!   
  
We first discovered these incredibly talented musicians while attending a gig they were playing at a local winery. We were in awe of their performance and after chatting with them, we knew we had to have them play at our wedding. The way they engaged with the crowd and the incredible energy they brought to their set was exactly what we were looking for.  
  
At our wedding reception, Scott and Rosanna played a fantastic selection of songs, covering a wide range of popular artists and genres that truly set the mood for our celebration. Their energy added so much warmth and joy to the atmosphere. Each song was performed with such passion and skill, and their ability to adapt to the vibe of the evening made the experience even more special. They even acted as the MCs of the evening, announcing us into the reception and making several announcements throughout the evening.   
  
One of the most touching moments of the night came from our first dance song. First off, our first dance song wasn’t part of their initial repertoire, but they happily offered to learn it for us. We were so moved by their willingness to go the extra mile to make our day even more special. The weather during our reception wasn’t the best, but that never fazed Scott and Rosanna. As the night came to a close, they performed our first dance song again, as we danced in the rain, surrounded by our loved ones. It was truly magical and a moment we will never forget.   
  
Throughout the evening, we received countless compliments from our guests, who appreciated the beautiful live music. Scott and Rosanna’s professionalism and talent were evident, and they helped create a memorable ambiance that made our wedding reception even more magical.  
  
We also want to mention that the cost of their services is incredibly reasonable for everything they offer. The value they provide—both in terms of the performance and the experience—far exceeded our expectations.  
  
We highly recommend them for anyone looking for talented musicians who can create an unforgettable atmosphere, no matter the occasion.   
  
Scott & Rosanna - Thank you for being such an integral part of our celebration!

Thank you! 

In a word, Scott and Rosanna were perfect. They played through my wedding ceremony and cocktail hour. They even took the time to learn a new song, one that was special to my wife and I, and performed it beautifully.  
  
I have received several compliments over the last few days about how lovely our ceremony and cocktail hours were, and how the music played a large role in it. Our wedding simply would not have been the same without them.  
  
I would hire them again in a heartbeat. Thanks for making our day so special, Scott and Rosanna!

The perfect duo that made our night extra special! 

We had Scott and Rosanna play our cocktail hour and dinner hour for our recent wedding, they also did our first dance, father/daugher, mother/son, and a tribute dance. We can not say enough good things about them. They are a breeze to work with, so accommodating, going out of their way to make our night so special! Rosanna’s voice is so beautiful together, Scott can play any song (including dave matthews - blew us away!!) Scott and Rosanna gave our reception exactly the romantic and lively vibe we were going for. I highly recommend them for any occasion.

10/10 experience!

Scott and Rosanna were an absolute pleasure to work with! We first heard their music on YouTube and knew immediately that we wanted them to play at our wedding. So many of our guests complimented the live music and not only are Scott and Rosanna such talented musicians, but they are also the kindest people! We are so grateful to have had them at our wedding!

Magical wedding cocktail celebration with S&R

Scott and Rosanna were an excellent addition to our cocktail hour after our wedding ceremony. The entire experience was very pleasant as they were responsive via email and answered our questions before booking, they were very reasonably priced (actually a steal!!), worked with us to pick a lineup of songs we loved, and were very professional and accommodating the day of the event. They even dealt with a little rain but still played under cover on the back patio. Their music was perfect for the occasion, providing perfect background music that everyone new and loved, but not overpowering the mingling guests enjoying appetizers and cocktails. Our only regret is not getting to sit and enjoy them more during their set, but as the Bride and Groom, we had a lot going on that day :-). Highly recommend and couldn't be happier with this lovely duet.
