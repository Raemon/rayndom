The most magical wedding setting and amazing staff!!!

My husband and I got married at the Stone Mill at the New York Botanical Gardens on 9/14/24 and I am in constant awe of the memories of how perfect our day was. We initially toured the venue with Chantal and immediately felt like her and her team were people we would like to work with. She’s warm, kind, and you can tell she’s very on top of things. The Stone Mill itself is such a unique and perfect venue - it’s like a warm, romantic, cozy stone cottage structure in a secluded forest on the river while still being in the city! Throughout the wedding planning process, we worked with both Chantal and Brittany and they were both wonderful to work with! They were prompt with responses and were so helpful in working out any issue or decision that we needed assistance with. Sometimes we felt like we were bombarding with too many emails but they were always super kind and helpful! There was a large group tasting in July for all the upcoming weddings and it was so fun to attend - they set it up like your attending a wedding itself and trying food in both a cocktail hour and sit-down dinner portion. The wedding itself was nothing short of an absolute DREAM! We had about 100 guests which felt like the perfect size for this space. We also got ready in the morning in Manhattan and it was easy to transfer up to the venue! We knew the space itself would be stunning (and it was!), but we were also blown away by the NYBG team. On the day of, we saw some of both Brittany and Chantal and had a bridal attendant taking care of us. They made us both feel like the most special people in the world and like they were there to make sure our day was absolutely perfect - and it was! We arrived to Champagne and snacks for the wedding party before photos. There is a small bridal suite with a private bathroom to get dressed in. My husband and I were driven around in a golf cart for photos and they know exactly where to bring you to get stunning pictures! The wedding itself went seamlessly - there isn’t a person who worked with us that isn’t both extremely kind and so professional. Guests are greeted upon arrival with a glass of champagne and a valet who parks their car. The venue itself feels so private and it was so lovely to hear the peaceful river during the ceremony. After the ceremony, my husband and I were escorted to the bridal suite where the staff had stocked it with all the food from cocktail hour and drinks to make sure we didn’t miss anything! The food was amazing!! We had so many guests commenting on this being the best wedding food they’ve ever had, how kind everyone who worked the wedding was, and what a stunning venue it was! There was a small issue with the cake that wasn’t even a big deal and they handled it perfectly but as an apology for there being a small inconvenience, my husband and I were welcomed home from our honeymoon with a cake from the bakery who made our wedding cake as a gift from the venue staff! I truly truly can’t recommend enough getting married at the Stone Mill. We felt so taken care of and celebrated at all times, it’s such a unique and beautiful venue, and they have the absolute best team. When I think of our wedding, I think of the word magical and that’s largely in part to what an amazing venue we chose. It’s also so cool to be able to go back to the gardens now after the wedding and relive the memories of the day. We highly recommend and couldn’t be more grateful to the team for helping to make our day as special as it was!

Get married here, seriously.

We really wanted to choose a wedding venue that would be around forever and that wasn't just a venue that churned out weddings - we wanted it to be a place that was meaningful to us so that we could take our future children there one day and visit on our anniversary. From the moment we saw the Stone Mill at NYBG, we knew that we would get married there. It was just magical. This impression only became stronger after meeting Chantal, who is truly professional. We immediately understood that she truly cared about us instead of trying to push a sale. She knows everything there is to know about her business. She was so patient and generous with her time in answering our many questions, and she was so respectful of everyone involved. With her intuition and attention to good fit, she also paired us with incredible staff - bridal attendant Sasha and service captain Zachary - who took impeccable care of us and our guests. Sasha had a keen eye and helped me immensely as a bride to look and feel at my best and most comfortable. Throughout the process, Chantal was there with her attention to detail and made us feel like we were the only wedding in the universe. She was available on our wedding day to supervise and problem-solve immediately, and we could tell that she is so loved and respected by her staff for a reason. We were so fortunate to work with her and her team and would not hesitate to do so again.

Hidden gem in NYC - Lush blooms, rustic scenery and scrumptious food!

The Stone Mill venue is stunning, especially in June. We had photos taken in the Rockefeller Rose Garden, and they came out fabulous.  
  
The price includes a lot more than just the lush backdrop. The food was sumptuous, the cake (included) was beautiful and delicious, and the service was top notch. Plus the linens, tables, silverware, and pretty much all the tables and chairs you’re going to need are all included in the cost. We received numerous compliments from our guests.  
  
Working with the catering staff leading up to the event was a dream. Our poised, attentive, and experienced coordinator had a great disposition, and the team that ended up working the wedding was polished and professional.  
  
Would give more stars if we could. We could not be happier!

Book them today!

I am a wedding planner who just worked my first wedding at the Stone Mill building in the NYBG. This venue offers the best of the best. The team will move mountains for their couples. Nina, the director of catering at the Garden is absolute top tier. Both empathetic and extremely professional. Victoria, the maitre d was the absolute best. Medardo the couple's attendant was the sweetest most attentive person you've ever met. Only great things to say about this team.

Tears of joy for this amazing experience 

WHAT A VENUE! I do not have enough positive feedback to give to NYBG and I couldn’t be happier to have had my wedding here. Everything was a dream. The gorgeous ambiance speaks volumes for itself. But what truly made the wedding spectacular was the level of service.   
Let me start by addressing the catering manager, Chantal. When I met Chantal, I was immediately sold. Her calm demeanor, chill personality and sweet soul made me love her and want to work with her. There was not one thing she didn’t do for me. From getting the tequila I like to drink, to sourcing a parmesean wheel for cocktail hour, and tying the napkins on the table the way I liked them, she did it all. She answered every phone call, every text and email and never told me that there was something she couldn’t do. Even when things went wrong, she was there to make sure it was made right. I truly consider her family now. She went above and beyond for me for two years and even more throughout my wedding night. I cannot thank her enough.   
My bridal attendant, Sasha was a pure treasure. She was with me the whole day and constantly made sure I was drinking, eating, and happy. She came to all of our photos and was so sweet to take some of her own just to send me the next day. She’s an amazing person and I was so lucky to have her.   
The food was out of sight!! My family is Italian so we added A LOT to the menu and there wasn’t one bad thing I had. I honestly wish I ate more but I heard it was incredible.   
I could cry from all of the gratitude I feel for this incredible company. My wedding day was everything I wanted and I am so glad I chose NYBG. this place will forever hold the most special place in my heart. I can’t wait to come back every year, and reminisce about the time we had.

Chantal was the MVP of our wedding!

We just had our wedding at the NYBG in the Garden Terrace room. We worked with Chantal who could not have been more helpful and enjoyable to work with. She helped us curate our dream day and worked with us every step of the way to personalize the tiniest details. She was responsive, patient, and overall had an incredibly positive attitude. We have nothing to say but overwhelmingly positive things about working with her. Truly a delight.

Most beautiful venue of all time

We were married in the Garden Terrace Room on June 3 and everything about the day exceeded our expectations. Katie Parker and her team perfectly orchestrated a beautiful event. Everything involved leading up the day was impeccably organized. Katie coordinated numerous calls and a site visit - she was accommodating to every single request. The day of was incredibly smooth and flawless. Our bridal suite was overflowing with drinks and snacks (so appreciated) and all of our guests raved about the food AND the service. The feedback from everyone was: “The best wedding ever” and the backdrop of the gardens is simply unmatched. The team at NYBG is exceptional at what they do ... would recommend 12/10 and only wish we could do it over again!

Magical Multicultural Wedding at the Stone Mill

Our wedding was everything we imagined it to be and more! Constellation Culinary at NYBG were more than accommodating to all of our needs for a multicultural ceremony and reception. Katie Parker was highly responsive and very professional and helped bring our vision to life!

Stone Mill in the winter 

nd it was very comfortable both at the downstairs room for cocktail hour and we did round tables (9 tables with a mix of 9 and 8 or 10 seats) and there was elbow room and plenty of dancing space, even with a 7 piece band. We had a jazz brass trio during cocktail hour. The service at our wedding was fantastic. We got married at another location so this was our reception venue only and we had the space from 6-12. Remember that the garden closes before 6 but they won’t let people drive up to the stone mill until then so folks will be lined up before hand. I think that was the only thing to navigate - it’s also a long drive (and in December in the dark!) from the mosholu gate to the stone mill and the golf cart meant to escort the line of cars died on the drive so our parents had to lead the procession themselves lol and got a bit lost but hey - that’s part of the experience of the garden! Maybe having more signage for future weddings making their way there. I would recommend this as a wedding venue to anyone who is looking for a romantic, rustic, intimate theme to their day. Even in December we had the florist put bistro lights on the patio outside and many people went outside to get some fresh air even though it was very cold the day of our wedding! Oh we also had the downstairs cocktail hour turn into a kids zone and the staff was great in turning it around for us.
