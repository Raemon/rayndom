The one thing in my opinion is to have flowers that set off a ceremony. The staff at Always and Forever florists helped pick the flowers that best met my needs. The flowers turned out very beautiful and were commented about all night long. If I had to pick anyone to do my floral needs it would be them.

Reflections of Miranda coordinated my wedding in the Fall of 2007 and it was perfect!! They knew the desires of our hearts and made sure that we got everything that we asked for. The staff was very professional, organized, courteous, and on time. Working with Miranda and her staff throughout my wedding process was a breeze as they were very readily available to me via phone or email and even in person if issues arose. For the best possible outcome with a reasonable price, you should put your trust in Reflections of Miranda and surely you won't be disappointed!!! Charles and Lahendra Marshall

Monty made my wedding look beautiful. She really made an effort to make the money go as far as it could with the flowers. She is also very creative and had great ideas that enhanced the look of the wedding.
