Bella Petali was excellent to work with! I had a small flower budget, but they worked with the budget I had rather than turn me away like most florists I requested quotes from. The bouquets they arranged for my bridesmaids and I literally stole the show in all of my pictures. It was special to work with Bella Petali, and I would highly recommend them to anyone!

She was so professional and thought of every possible thing. When I first reached out to her, she just seemed to know exactly what I had in mind down to every detail. And she literally had everything explained, listed, and itemized down to the penny. She was so good about working out the time frame between other vendors, and it just made our day a lot easier. I knew she had it all handled 100%. And, of course, all the flowers were gorgeous and perfect!!

Alan Cotton provided the most beautiful flowers for my wedding! He was very accommodating and willing to spend one-on-one time with us after hours on multiple occasions to insure we got exactly what we wanted! He set up and cleaned up on the day of the wedding, leaving us nothing to worry about! Everyone in his shop was friendly and helpful! I would definitely recommend his services to a friend!

Mark and Ron were an absolute JOY to work with. They were so helpful, so responsive, and so receptive to exactly what I wanted. The flowers turned out so incredible...from the bouquets, to the church, to the tables at the reception. I cannot recommend them enough!

The most amazing place to design your wedding! The floral is perfect and the wedding planner is even better ;) flowers are never going to be inexpensive by any means but they were all so worth the price!

It was very pleasant working the Hoover Florist. Very friendly and easy to talk with. They helped me come up with beautiful bouquets that were more breathtaking that I could have imagined.
