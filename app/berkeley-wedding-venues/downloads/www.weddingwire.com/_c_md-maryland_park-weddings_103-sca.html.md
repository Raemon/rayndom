We had our wedding at Swan Harbor in late October 2022 and it was wonderful. Terri and Diane were extremely helpful, responsive, and kind throughout the entire planning process (and I had a lot of questions from beginning to end). The venue offers a beautiful sprawling space for small or large weddings, and the tent being included was an added bonus. We used both the front and back of the house for our cocktail hour and got married under the gorgeous tree overlooking the Bay. Another reason we loved Swan Harbor is that we felt like this venue offered us the ability to make our wedding truly unique and bring in aspects that we wouldn't have been able to do at an all-inclusive venue. There are trade-offs to this, as working with additional vendors and rental companies can add onto the budget and create for some additional challenges/coordination leading up to the big day, but it was important to us that we had a wedding that brought in different aspects of our relationship and families. We also really loved that we could add on hours to the day (for an additional cost that will be written into the contract). That allowed the guys to go earlier in the day to get ready and then have an extended reception, which often wasn't offered at other venues. All in all, we loved our experience with Terri and Diane and the rest of the Swan Harbor team, and would recommend this venue to friends and family in the future! They went above and beyond in making sure everything was squared away. Thank you for helping to make our vision for our big day become a reality!

Can’t say thank you enough to Stephanie & Scott from Port A for helping our day go as stress free & as smooth as possible. They both went above and beyond for us! From helping me decide the final layout of tables, adding last minute decor, to a very stressful last minute seating change due to the weather- the crew was on top of everything! Couldn’t have imagined my special day going any differently! 10/10 would recommend to any bride!!

I was lucky enough to get both the Arts Pavilion and the Ballroom for use Labor Day Weekend for my "I Do" BBQ prior to my destination wedding. Every time I reached out to Susan I received responses almost immediately including on weekends when I did not expect to hear from anyone until business hours. Susan was exceptional in explaining my options for setup and access and letting me come on site multiple times to survey for the planning of my setup. The grounds crew was super helpful and nice and flexible when they didn't have to be. I would absolutely recommend Oregon Ridge for any kind of event. My family and friends loved the vast grounds and the beautiful scenery. Best decision to book this venue!!!

We had an amazing time at Camp Puh'Tok for our wedding weekend! We booked for a full weekend and invited friends to stay multiple nights to celebrate with us. We used so many different areas of camp for activities, and the venue offered lots of space both to spread out and to gather. The night before our wedding, a huge storm swept through and knocked out the power and water to the venue. It could have been a disaster, but Elizabeth and Alexi brought us bottled water and located generators and portable bathrooms for the wedding day. We made the most of it and still got to use the zipline and pool and had an incredible reception in the dining hall. I was so grateful for their help, and so glad we chose Puh'Tok!

Location, location. Such a beautiful setting, particularly for the ceremony. The gazebo is nice and the background is beautiful, requiring minimal additional decor. We had a great experiment with every staff and club member we met. Everyone seemed genuinely invested in making sure we had the best day. Chantelle, the events manager, was patient, kind, and very hard working. She even pulled through on some details I missed. The reception space comes with some decor: white chair covers, ceiling drapery, ceiling fairy lights, etc. One caveat: the event planning management changed after we booked. They were great about it, honoring our original agreement. But I do believe the venue cost has increased.
