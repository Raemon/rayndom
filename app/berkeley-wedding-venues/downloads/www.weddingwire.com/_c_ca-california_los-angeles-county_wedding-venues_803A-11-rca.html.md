Celebrated my wedding here and have absolutely no regrets. Staff was friendly and quick to respond. They also had recommendations for vendors since I was overwhelmed trying to book things like linens and flowers (you have the option to pick anyone of your choosing though). The hall also included dishes/silverware for our guests! It was difficult to find a venue that could accommodate our very large wedding for a reasonable price - so I was so grateful to find this place. Tons of free parking on site which is a rare find in LA. Nearby hotels for your guests. Playground for children and plenty of outdoor space to gather. The hall itself is massive and has a cathedral feel to it with beautiful chandeliers. There is a large bar and huge stage for a band as well. Everything was very clean as well which was important to us. You really can’t go wrong with this place, check it out!

We absolutely loved having our wedding at Coco Palm. The view, the architecture, and the layout of the building all provided an elegant, unique backdrop for our theme. In fact, it wasn't until I toured the property that I was inspired to create our dreamy aesthetic. We loved working with the staff at Coco Palm because they KNOW weddings, it's what they do so they already pretty much know what people are going to ask, what they are going to want. The service of the waitstaff at our wedding was exceptional. They went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we could ask for and treated us like royalty. All of our guests had great feedback about the service as well. Last but not least, the food is obviously delicious and something special for a wedding. It was a priority for us to have a great dinner for our guests and Coco Palm was perfect. The packages they offer for events are a really great value compared to every other venue we looked at. So much is included, and it helped alleviate some of our planning stress. Can't wait to go back and celebrate more events here!

I cannot express how grateful my husband and I are to have booked our wedding reception at The Grand. We worked primarily with Marissa and Lauren on this event for close to 18 months due to postponements as a result of COVID. What stands out about this venue is their professionalism. We opted to go with this venue primarily for this reason and the value for what you are getting. Throughout all the changes, they were nothing but responsive and helpful in any way they could be. My emails were always answered promptly. Despite all the stress from having to change my wedding plans, I never had to worry about being taken care of at The Grand. When my husband and I finally had our event this past October, everything on our agreement was delivered as promised. Zero issues whatsoever. We had great waitstaff and a super fun bartender. The venue itself was set up beautifully. Thank you so much to everyone at The Grand for creating such a beautiful day for us.

Words truly cannot express how absolutely perfect our wedding day was at Sierra La Verne by Wedgewood Weddings. From start to finish, the experience was seamless, joyful, and full of magic – all thanks to the incredible team who brought our vision to life: Darsey, Cassy, Siera, and Omar. From the very beginning, Darsey made us feel like our wedding was just as important to her as it was to us. Her attention to detail, organization, and calming presence gave us confidence that everything would be taken care of – and she did not disappoint. She’s a true professional who knows weddings inside and out, and she went above and beyond to make sure every detail reflected who we are as a couple. Cassy was our go-to girl for all the logistics and communication in the weeks leading up to the wedding. She was so responsive, warm, and reassuring – answering all our questions (big or small) and helping us stay on track. I can’t thank her enough for making the planning process feel exciting instead of stressful! Siera & Arlene brought such a genuine excitement and sparkle to the day. Her energy was contagious, and she had such an eye for making sure the aesthetic and ambiance were exactly what we wanted. She really made us feel celebrated and special throughout the entire process. And Omar… wow! On the day of, he ran the show with such grace and precision. He made sure everything ran on time, coordinated the vendors flawlessly, and was always two steps ahead. I don’t think I saw him stop moving once – and yet, he always had a smile and encouraging word. He is an absolute rock star. The venue itself is breathtaking – with a gorgeous ceremony site, beautiful greenery, and an elegant reception space that felt intimate yet spacious. The food was amazing, the DJ kept the dance floor packed, and every guest raved about how smoothly everything flowed. If you're considering getting married at Sierra La Verne, don’t hesitate – book it, and ask for this dream team. Darsey, Cassy, Siera, Arlene and Omar made our wedding not just a beautiful event, but a truly unforgettable experience. We’re endlessly grateful for them, and we’ll cherish the memories forever.

My husband and I just celebrated our wedding here September 6,2025 and there are no words for how magical this place is. We had 75 guests celebrate with us on the Fountain Patio and Amanda with her team (Mariya, Krystal, and Karla) made the day stress free and unforgettable. The venue is accommodating, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is beautiful. We had the pleasure of getting ready and staying the evening at The Amethyst Inn next door and I highly recommend for weddings or even just staying the night! Amanda, Mariya, Krystal, and Karla were always checking in and really did give us a worry-free evening as well as the most beautiful wedding I have ever seen (although I may be a little biased). We even had the pleasure of enjoying brunch the next day!

💗Sonesta Redondo Beach and Marina is an absolutely stunning venue that exceeded all of our expectations for our Valentine's Day wedding. The moment we stepped into the hotel, we were greeted with breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean and the warmest hospitality. Mrs. Cheryl, our wedding coordinator, was simply outstanding. She was not only sweet and professional but also incredibly detail-oriented, ensuring that every aspect of our special day was flawless. She went above and beyond to make sure our wedding was perfect, and her dedication truly made our celebration unforgettable. The venue itself is a picture-perfect setting, with elegant indoor spaces and a beautiful outdoor terrace that provided the perfect backdrop for some of our photos. The Peninsula ballroom was gorgeous, and all of guests raved about how lovely it was. We moved the ceremony indoors as well, since it was too cold and windy to use the pool deck area. The catering staff was attentive and accommodating, and the food was delicious. We had sea bass, steak and chicken entrees for our guests to select from. Mrs. Cheryl customized our package, since we didn't want the open bar. We did use one of their preferred vendors, Vox Djs, and it turned out really well. This was the first venue we toured, and after looking at 7 other potential venues, Sonesta really had the most value for the money. We couldn't have asked for a more magical day, and we are so grateful to Sonesta Redondo Beach and Marina for making our wedding dreams come true. Thank you Mrs. Cheryl, Robin, all the banquet staff, and the valet guys.💗 P.S. We were able to select our own bakery for our cake. Since the folks at Torrance Bakery (the preferred vendor) were not very nice, creative, nor accommodating of what we wanted, which was a jaw-dropping, amazing wedding cake. Don't feel forced to use Torrance Bakery if you are not satisfied with your tasting/design consultation. For a wedding cake, you should not have to settle for less than perfection.

BOOK THEM NOW! We can't express how thankful we are to University Club of Pasadena for hosting our dream wedding. My husband and I toured countless venues and the services University Club provides exceeded them all. 1\. You get the venue for the entire day! Other venues we toured had strict times we could enter, some even requiring the bride to arrive completely ready because there wasn't a space for HMU. Cinthia was so flexible and even allowed us to arrive at 6AM to begin getting ready! We had a brunch spread with our family/bridal party there, where Cinthia had the staff assist with setting up and tearing down our brunch tables. 2\. The bar package is VERY flexible compared to other venues. We noticed that most of the venues we considered have a per-head cost, expensive since some of our elderly don't drink. UC instead allowed us to set a general bar limit, which afterwards they would convert into a cash bar (we didn't end up reaching our limit, but this was a very cost-effective set-up for us). 3\. Joy and Tony were incredible at customizing our drinks! Joy had so many creative suggestions for Asian inspired drinks - they allowed us to have multiple taste testings and we landed on a lychee mojito and strawberry soju in a martini glass. We had SO many guests rave about our signature drinks, asking us for the recipes! 4\. They went above and beyond for desserts!!!! We were so disappointed when other venues either don't allow outside vendors or have a fee - we're not cake people so we wanted to bring in Fosselman's ice cream instead. Cinthia and Chef Tony not only allowed us to bring in outside ice cream, but even told us that UC regularly serves Fosselman's for the club members so they could provide the ice cream for us instead of us bringing it! We originally wanted an ice cream bar, but they informed us they could only scoop the ice cream from the kitchen and have the waiters pass them around on trays because of their freezer location. However, the week of our wedding, Cinthia called us and said they've figured out a way to create our ice cream bar! It meant so much to us that UC was still trying to figure out a way to have our dream dessert station even though my husband and I were fine with tray-passed ice cream - and SO many guests complimented us for the ice cream station! 5\. Cinthia and Chef Tony are very willing to work with you to make sure the entrees are exactly the way you want it! We initially weren't incredibly happy with the salmon during out taste testing, so they had us come in again to try the chicken with another free taste test (this is a huge deal - other venues often charge for taste tests)! They even allowed us to sub mashed potatoes for scalloped potatoes etc. I'll be honest - we thought the food at our taste testing was okay, pretty decent wedding food. BUT the food the night of our wedding was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! We had so many guests (some of our guests are even wedding coordinators) compliment us for the food! Multiple parents also said this wedding had the best kid meals they've ever seen with delicious chicken tenders and fries - I had a dad even ask if he could also have a kids meal! Other details that makes UC stand out... \- Parking ON SITE with a private lot! \- You have the entire building to yourself! \- Indoors in case of rain! \- I noticed some wedding websites giving UC three dollar signs, but this venue is actually VERY accommodating to your budget with fair prices \- 10/10 STAFF. Cinthia, Tony (bar), Tony (chef), and Joy are absolutely amazing to work with!

##  Los Angeles Wedding Venues 

While Los Angeles translates to the city of Angels, it's more well known for being the city of the rich and famous. With gorgeous temperatures year round, LA is a great spot for booking your future wedding venue. Whether you're looking to have a destination wedding on a west coast beach or a classic hotel wedding, Los Angeles has wedding locations for every type of person. 

##  Popular Wedding Venues in Los Angeles & Prices 

Surrounded by mountains and beaches, Los Angeles is a sight to sea. That doesn't even include the modern and classical architecture that can be found in the city. Popular wedding venues in Los Angeles include: hotels, banquet halls, ballrooms, wineries, estates, chateaux, and beachfront resorts. Whatever you and your fiancé(e) are looking for in a wedding location, Los Angeles can surely provide. 

If you're looking to get married with your toes in the sand, there are plenty of beachfront ceremony and reception venues. Whether you're looking to stay on a oceanfront property, or travel to a particular wedding venue, LA has some great options. And with good weather all year long, you and your guests can celebrate your nuptials as well as escaping the cold. 

For more traditional venues, hotels, ballrooms, and banquet halls are a great option for indoor spaces that can be perfectly molded into your dream wedding. Hotels are also great if you're hosting a large number of out-of-town guests. Extra transportation isn't necessary if guests are just a few floors above the venue. 

Lovers of architecture and history might consider saying "I do" in a chateau, estate, or manor house. Guests will be blown away with the immensity of the venue, while the couple will be thrilled to have a variety of options for ceremony and reception spaces. A great choice if you plan on getting hitched when it's more likely to rain, moving to a backup space within the wedding venue should be simple. Just talk with the venue about their inclement weather policies before booking. 

For outdoor enthusiasts and wine lovers alike, getting married at a winery wedding venue is sure to wow guests. Wineries tend to have more Mediterranean architecture with warm reds and browns. If you're looking to have an elegant outdoor soirée, a winery is the way to do. 

As far as pricing goes, the average cost for a Los Angeles wedding is around $34,289, which is about $5,000 over the national average. If your LA wedding budget doesn't look quite like this, don't worry. Each wedding budget is as unique as the couple planning. 

##  Travel & Hotel Accommodations 

There are a few ways for out-of-town wedding guests to get to your Los Angeles wedding venue. The Bob Hope Airport and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) are the two closest airports for wedding venues in the city. While The Bob Hope Airport only has domestic flights, it's closer to venues in the heart of LA. Leaving the airport by car or train will take about 30-40 minutes to reach venues in the city. This will be a good option for guests flying nationally as well as if your wedding venue is near Burbank, Pasadena, Glendale, or the San Fernando Valley. 

For international guests looking for a non-stop flight, LAX is the way to go. While it's a longer drive and train trip (40 mins to an hour) to wedding venues in the city, it's a good option if your venus is closer to Torrance, Santa Monica, Redondo Beach, or Inglewood. 

With out-of-town guests comes hotel accommodations and we know how stressful it can be finding an affordable hotel near your ceremony and reception venues. We recommend checking out this fantastic [wedding hotel block](https://hotelblocks.weddingwire.com "Wedding Hotel Block") service. Representatives will find the best rates for multiple rooms at hotels close to your wedding venues. All you have to do is decide which hotel or hotels are best for you and send the booking information to your guest. 

##  Weather Considerations 

As previously mentioned, Los Angeles is known for it's constant beautiful weather and temperate conditions, which makes it the perfect place to say "I do" at anytime of the year. Due to it's location, LA has a mediterranean climate with dry warm summers and mild winters. If you're hoping for a classic winter wedding, Los Angeles might not be the best choice when considering wedding venues. Temperatures in LA typically don't drop below 43 degrees or rise above 83 degrees. 

The warm season lasts from early July to early October, with high temperatures averaging above 73 degrees. The hottest days are likely to be towards the end of August. Pro tip: It can get humid in Los Angeles, so if you're booking an outdoor or open air wedding venue, fans and misting machines are a great way to keep guests cool and comfortable. You can also serve drinks during the ceremony or consider giving fans as wedding favors. It's a great way to give beautiful and practical wedding favors. While it's always good to take precautions, the summer months, specifically August, are least likely to have any form of rain. 

For the 'cold' winter months, you don't even have to consider snow. In Los Angeles it's a virtual impossibility. The 'cold' season lasts from the beginning of December to the middle of April, with daily temperatures averaging below 66 degrees. If you're planning on getting married at an outdoor wedding venue during the LA winter, consider going with thicker apparel. For brides, long sleeve wedding gowns are always a great look. For grooms, think about getting suits or tuxes in a thicker material like wool or tweed. And while LA is not known for having a great deal of rain, the most precipitation occurs around the end of February, so be sure to have a backup wedding venue available. 

When you're ready to start your search for wedding venues in Los Angeles, WeddingWire has everything you need to make the whole process a snap!
