We had such a wonderful experience working with Eventful Designs for our wedding invitations! They truly helped bring our vision to life with such care, creativity, and attention to detail. One of the most special parts of our suite was being able to include custom artwork created by the groom’s brother, and the team at Eventful Designs seamlessly incorporated it in a way that felt so personal and meaningful. They were patient, collaborative, and so easy to work with throughout the entire design process. They answered lots of emails and questions that we had with grace. Every piece felt completely “us” and set the perfect tone for our wedding day. We received so many compliments from guests on how beautiful and unique everything was. We’re so grateful for their talent and dedication, and would recommend Eventful Designs to anyone looking for custom, thoughtful wedding paper goods!

We had such a wonderful experience working with Amanda for all our wedding stationery—our invitations, day-of prints, and thank-you cards. She was incredibly helpful, responsive, and kind throughout the entire process. Amanda made everything feel easy, offered thoughtful guidance, and brought our vision to life beautifully. The quality of the designs and prints exceeded our expectations, and we received so many compliments from guests. I’m so grateful for her care and attention to detail. Highly recommend and we can't wait to work with Amanda again!

I was a large "to it yourself" bride who works in communication/marketing and has the ability to figure out how to make each element I wanted, but at some point I simply don't have time to do it all! The Copy Shop was wonderful to sit down with to look at options of save the dates, invitation suites, and programs. It was a fun process to gather ideas from their many ideas and designs. Their designer, Makenna was so patient as I designed part of the suite but she finished it out. They provided ideas on colors, designs, paper options, and were personal. When planning my wedding, I didn't want my suite to look like other weddings and they made sure it was classy and personalize to me, better than most online options. We even created fan programs for our outdoor wedding - they were such a hit! This is something we wouldn't have thought about without the Copy Shop! I think it is vital to support small business where you live, and the Copy Shop provided quality, competitive cost, unique designs quick turnaround and a great experience. I would recommend this to anyone in the area getting married!

Allegra Printing in Alsip is truly incredible from start to finish. Their customer service, responsiveness, and attention to detail are unmatched. They welcomed me into their showroom multiple times and were so patient and supportive throughout the entire design process. I never felt rushed — they genuinely wanted everything to be perfect. I used Allegra for both my Save the Dates and my acrylic wedding invitations, and I received countless compliments. Everything looked so classy and elegant — exactly the vibe I was going for. Jan, who leads the production process, is wonderful to work with, and Shannon, the graphic designer, is absolutely amazing. They send multiple proofs, make as many edits as you need, and ensure you love every detail before printing. They also offer their professional advice about what they've done for previous invitation suites and guide you through what looks most elegant and timeless from their experiences. They truly go above and beyond, and I’m so grateful I chose them. I even used them for my wedding thank-you cards! I can’t wait to use Allegra for all of my future invitations and printing needs. Highly, highly recommend!

When I started the process, I had ideas of what I wanted for all of our stationary and not only did Peggy with Erickson design meet those expectations, but she definitely exceeded them. When I say I cried when we received our invitations from pure joy, bliss, and excitement, I am not even kidding. Her designs are BEAUTIFUL and just so perfect. She really does listen to exactly what you want and really tries to meet your goal aesthetic. 10/10 recommend!

Leslie and her staff were wonderful from start to finish. They were patient, kind and took the time to help us not only with the stationary, but also appropriate wording and etiquette for our invitations, thank you notes and wedding website. The store is lovely and their selection of stationary is beautiful and extensive. A lovely shop and a lovely experience from start to finish.

My new husband was very happy with louie's. He chose a tux that suited him quite well (we all said he looked like the count of Monte Cristo!). Everyone seemed happy with their experience, so I would definitely recommend them.

Cherri is wonderful. She has her business out of her home, but she's still professional. She is a very sweet woman, and works very hard for you. I felt comfortable with her and new she wasn't ripping me off with any extra charges (shipping, rush order, etc.), which I found could have happened had I not ordered through her. She has TONS of books to go through, and she lets you take them home, which helped us make our decision quickly and comfortably. Highly recommend her.

Kari was easy to get in touch with to book, and responded to my emails quickly. Her calligraphy was beautiful and matched a sample I had found for her to work from. She is very flexible and open to making whatever the bride desires. She is now working with me on a project I plan to give as an anniversary gift to my parents because I had such a great experience. Highly recommended!
