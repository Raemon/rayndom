I can only say positive things with our experience at Marriott SFO Waterfront in Burlingame, CA. We chose this hotel to have our wedding on 6/9/18. EVERYONE was so friendly, helpful and accommodating. Alicia Gonzalez with the sales team helped us book the space and was so flexible and creative with helping us see the vision. Our wedding was in Bayside Rooms I, II and III. Alicia gave us the great idea to do the ceremony in Bayside II, cocktail hour in Bayside I (with the great view of the airport and Bay water), while the staff turned Bayside II & III into the banquet room. Essentially, all three rooms were opened into one banquet room with the bar and photo booth in the cocktail room. It was very spacious for a wedding of 110 guests. We could've added more tables!  
  
Jennifer Vizcarra, our Event Manager! How lucky were we to have her! She's very responsive and so patient with all our questions. Our wedding would not have gone as smoothly as it did without her! She walked us through all the necessities and provided clear direction. She worked very closely with us on everything. Chef Walter was very accommodating with our menu selections during the tasting and even came out to us at the wedding to ensure everything was okay. The entire Marriott staff (chef, banquet staff, valet, bell hop, front desk, restaurant & bar staff, housekeeping..everyone!) were all so friendly. We were always greeted with a smile & the staff were so helpful with everything we needed.  
  
The hotel rooms were clean & updated. We had a suite with our wedding package & it was so nice & spacious! I felt like I was at home! We're local and will definitely go back for meals and drinks. You couldn't ask for a better view! They have different rooms for all size events. It's a great venue and I HIGHLY recommend for you to at least do a tour and see what they have to offer! I know the Marriott team will do their best to make your event successful!

We got married here on Nov 12, 2016. We worked a few people in the beginning but Tammy Chan was our main point of contact - and she always went above and beyond! She and team really cared about our event and wanted to make sure every detail was perfect. Our venue was the Jr Ballroom and they had offered to give us the main ballroom because of the size of the party/guest that had RSVP'd yes, but we stuck with the Jr Ballroom because of the view and that's it's off to the side of the hotel. Everyone from the valet team, front desk, and security were amazing. Great hidden gem in the peninsula that not a lot of people know about. Great place to also take pictures outside, even in Nov there was a lot of greenery.

We had our reception only at the SFO marriott. We primarily worked with Wendy Hom. She was very friendly and easy to work with. We were very happy with the event itself and the food was a lot better than most hotel weddings. They also made a signature drink for us, a lychitini, which was a hit!  
There were a few issues - the contract was initially written up incorrectly and they charged us our food and drink minimum as well as the cost of the meals, essentially double charging us. Even after I pointed out the mistake, they still didn't understand what was wrong with the contract. There are packages deals and I wanted to take entrees from different packages and it wasn't clear if I could get the meals that I wanted at the price I wanted - we couldn't negotiate this until after we put down a deposit. Turns our I couldn't get the meals that I wanted. Also, they have a strict policy for insurance which was a bit of a pain for our lion dance troupe who have done many weddings at many venues and never had an issue with their insurance. we had to pay extra for a third party insurance.
