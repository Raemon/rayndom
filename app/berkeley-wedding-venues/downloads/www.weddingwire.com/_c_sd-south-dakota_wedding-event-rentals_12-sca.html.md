We used Ideal Wedding & Events for our recent wedding. We worked with their designer, Amy, from the planning stages many months before to the set-up on the wedding day and tear-down after. She was great at making our vision a reality and keeping us on budget. Ideal even had an arch built for us. Our wedding day was more beautiful than we had imagined and Ideal played an integral part in that. We recommend them highly.

6 South Designs did a great job with helping with decor for our wedding. They provided our arch and a few things in our reception area (Kings tables, privacy drapes, and our table runners) all of the decor the provided was beautiful and was set up perfectly. I definitely recommend their beautiful decorations.

I rented chair covers and table runners. The covers and runners were perfect and a reasonable price. My only complaint was that I had to pick them up on Friday the day of the rehearsal which added some stress. However the worked with me on the return date. I would recommend this company.

My wedding was an absolute FAIRYTALE! Everyone that attended said it was the most beautiful reception they'd ever been to and a lovely ceremony. Many people said it was like walking into a princess dream! I am so glad she got to be a part of my wedding experience! Highly recommend Esteemed Events by KC!
