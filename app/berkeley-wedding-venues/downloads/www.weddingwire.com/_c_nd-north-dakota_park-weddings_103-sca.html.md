We just had our wedding out at the Bluestem Venue last weekend. This is such a BEAUTIFUL venue for the amount of money especially. Joel was very easy to work with and our wedding was absolutely perfect! They do your set up and clean up. It just makes it very laid back and stress free. I recommend this place to anyone getting married. Another awesome part is there is a nice big back room for the girls to get ready and a nice laid back room for the guys to get ready in. We really loved the place!!
