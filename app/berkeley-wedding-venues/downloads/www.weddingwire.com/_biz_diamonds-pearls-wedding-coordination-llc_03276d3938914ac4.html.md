Highly impressed- well worth peace of mind! 

We hired Diamonds & Pearls for day-of coordination services and could not have been happier with the experience. From the very beginning, communication was clear, organized, and reassuring. In the weeks leading up to the wedding, she helped finalize timelines, coordinated with vendors, and made sure all the small details were accounted for so nothing fell through the cracks.  
  
On the wedding day itself, she was absolutely invaluable. She kept everything running smoothly behind the scenes, handled vendor arrivals and setup, managed the schedule, and calmly solved issues before we even knew they existed. Because of her, we were able to fully enjoy our day without worrying about logistics or timing.  
  
For the level of service, professionalism, and peace of mind we received, the cost was more than worth it. If you’re on the fence about hiring a coordinator, I can confidently say it was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a seamless, stress-free wedding day.

Wedding 10/2025

Jennifer was our day of coordinator for our October 2025 wedding and did an outstanding job. We did not have to worry or question anything about the day. She kept us on schedule and was amazing to work with. Everyone involved in the wedding highly enjoyed her that day. She was prompt with arriving and responding to any and all questions. She made the moment so relaxed and fun!

Best Decision I ever made for my wedding day

From a bride’s perspective, hiring Diamonds & Pearls Wedding Coordination was the best decision I made for my wedding day. From our very first conversation, I felt completely supported, understood, and at ease. Jennifer's calm, professional approach made everything feel organized and manageable.  
On the wedding day itself, I was able to be fully present and enjoy every moment without stress. The timeline ran flawlessly, vendors were handled seamlessly, and every detail was taken care of behind the scenes. If anything went wrong, I never knew about it—and that is priceless on your wedding day.  
Diamonds & Pearls truly allowed me to relax, soak in the joy, and focus on marrying the love of my life. If you’re a bride looking for peace of mind, professionalism, and someone who genuinely cares about your day, I cannot recommend them enough.
