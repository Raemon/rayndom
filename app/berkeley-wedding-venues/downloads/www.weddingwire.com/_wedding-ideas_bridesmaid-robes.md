Let's face it: One of the most fun parts of the wedding day is before the walk down the aisle, when you're sipping champagne and getting glammed up with your BFFs. The one thing that can make that even better? Matching bridesmaid robes. They're the perfect combo of cute, comfortable, and most importantly, they make for one heck of a [group photo](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/the-ultimate-wedding-photography-timeline). With plenty of options on the market for any body type and budget, you can even buy robes for your flower girl and mother of the bride. Plus, if you give them as [bridal party gifts](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/you-asked-we-answered-bridesmaid-gift-etiquette), your crew can reuse the robes well after your wedding date. Need some help getting started? We've hand-picked our favorite bridesmaid robe options, so all you have to do is relax and head to the checkout when you've found one (or a few) that pique your interest. 

## Floral Print Flutter Robe

This robe is aptly named, as it features fluttery ruffled trim along the bottom of the sleeves and hemline. The light lavender hue and floral print really lean into the fun and feminine vibe.
