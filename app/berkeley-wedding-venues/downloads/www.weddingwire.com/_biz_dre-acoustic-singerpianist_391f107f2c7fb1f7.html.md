Unbelievably perfect!

Dre was the perfect compliment to our small wedding. We had her play solo for our rehearsal dinner and then as a duo with her guitarist for our ceremony. So many guests told us how much they loved the music. Dre is genuinely a beautiful person inside and out. She went above and beyond to help us pick the song choices, we ended up walking down the aisle to "Thinking Out Loud" by Ed Sheeran. Thank you for being so wonderful!

Piano music for welcome dinner

We hosted our welcome dinner for our wedding weekend at Hotel Viata and the manager recommended Dre Acoustic for live music. She played piano for a couple hours and created a classy, sophisticated ambiance. She was easy to book and communicate with. Thanks Dre!

Charming ceremony music

Thank you Dre for your music at our wedding! I'm grateful we found you and had you play music during the ceremony instead of playing itunes, it was so much more unique. Planning a micro-wedding at our family house was seamless because our team of vendors all did a great job.

Highly recommended

Dre's solo performance at our ceremony was so elegant. Her music was moving and everyone loved the song choices we chose together. She was the easiest vendor to work with of my entire team, didn't bother me with a bunch of questions just covered the basics and then did her thing. Dre added such a special touch to our day. Can't thank her enogh!
