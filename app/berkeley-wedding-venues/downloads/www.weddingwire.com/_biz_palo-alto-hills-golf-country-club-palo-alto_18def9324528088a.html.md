Crystal was absolutely amazing during our entire wedding planning process. She was always very prompt in responding to emails and was quick to provide advice/help whenever needed. We made several visits out to the venue with out-of-town family, and Crystal was always more than happy to show everyone the beautiful venue. On the day of the wedding, she went above and beyond to make sure that everything was perfect for us! All of our personal items (champagne flutes, cake serving set, favors, Unity Cross, etc.) were set out and taken care of. Our guests really enjoyed their meals and raved about the gorgeous venue. The venue was breathtaking for all of our pictures. Crystal helped take care of the timeline of the whole night and everything went so smoothly! We couldn't have asked for a better wedding coordinator! Her easy going, professional personality really made her a joy to work with! Thank you for everything, Crystal and the whole crew at Palo Alto Hills Golf and Country Club!!!

The Palo Alto Hills Country Club was absolutely the right choice for my wedding. It exceeded our expectations as a venue and I would highly recommend this club to anyone searching for a golf course wedding/reception.   
  
Crystal is the event manager, and she was my day of coordinator. She is AMAZING! She was super easy to communicate with leading up to my wedding day, and she totally nailed every detail of our ceremony and reception. She must be really organized because I had A LOT of little details she had to make a note of and execute. I am beyond happy with the Palo Alto Hills Country Club. The grounds are gorgeous, the staff treated my guests so well, and the food was a hit! You know the food is top quality when it tastes just as good as your tasting!

This is an absolutely gorgeous place for weddings. Situated on top of the Palo Altos Hills, you not only have a great view, but a beautiful courtyard and dining room. The decor is tasteful. The staff is helpful and friendly, and they treat your friends with all due consideration and respect.   
  
LT the main coordinator is a gem to work with! Although the day of the wedding she was sick with the stomach flu, everything ran relatively smoothly. We had a few "hick-ups" along the way, but overall PAGCC worked their hardest to make us happy and accomodate to us. They also served one of the better wedding foods I've had. Everyone complimented on how delicious the food was here.   
  
Overall, I was really satisfied with how everything went here.

My husband and I visited many venues before we walked in to the Palo Alto Hills Golf & Country Club and the moment we walked in, we knew that it was the place where we wanted to celebrate our special day. We got married outside which was so beautiful that we didn't add any decorations outside. The wedding coordinator, LT, was extremely helpful. Every time we made an addition or change to our wedding, we emailed her and she updated our event plan and emailed a copy of it to us so we could ensure that she had all of the same information that we had. Not only did this help keep us organized, but it made it so on the day of the wedding, I didn't have to lift a finger - she knew exactly what to do! Additionally, my bridesmaids and I got ready at the club and they turned this room into a beautiful bridal suite with juice, champagne, and snacks. Everyone was extremely attentive and helpful from the moment we chose the venue until my husband and I drove off at the end of the night. Amazing venue.

I recently got married here at PA Hills Golf & Country Club! This was the second venue I looked into and the very first time I went there was also the moment my husband and I made an instant decision in having our wedding there. We loved the green of the golf course, the open space in the reception area, and the large bar. We had Whitney as our coordinator and she just made everything so easy for me. She was quick to answer emails, answered my billion questions (even if I repeated some), always was willing to have meetings and go over everything so that I had no worries. She always puts your interest before anything, even herself. The day of my wedding,she had a family emergency and she took the time to still show up to my wedding, help me set up, stayed till AFTER the ceremony to make sure everything went smooth. I couldn't have asked for a more attentive, thoughtful, and hard working wedding coordinator. I am so thankful for her and her assistant Katie. Because Whitney knew ahead of time that she couldn't be there for part of my wedding, she delegated everything so smoothly to Katie. Katie was also incredibly helpful and stayed with us throughout most of the wedding to make sure we were good on time and that everything would go smoothly.   
I thought the staff was wonderful, they helped clean everything up for us after the wedding and safely put everything into one room so that I could pick it up the following day. I thought that that was helpful because I didn't have to worry about bringing anything home the night of my wedding. The venue is gorgeous, I love everything about it, great for photos because of the green. The only thing I'd say is that since it is a member's only club, you have to be aware of the golfers being in your photos. They pay to golf there so it's totally understandable. My husband thought the food was very good. We both had the pork and loved it! Overall, I'm extremely happy with booking PA Hills.

Exceptional day of wedding

Overall, we ended up exceptionally happy with PAHGCC as our reception venue. Everything flowed very smoothly on the day, the food was excellent (we still have many friends and family voluntarily tell us it was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding), the wait staff was very well organized and attentive, Cassie (who has since left) helped tremendously on the day and in the week or so leading up to the wedding, and of course there are beautiful views from the country club.  
  
Unfortunately, we did experience some negatives on the preparatory side in the months leading up to the wedding. There were sometimes long delays in responses (we were at one point told that one person’s email system had been hacked, which we were never sure whether was true or just an excuse). This was at times frustrating as many aspects of planning a wedding are a dependency chain where you need one thing figured out, or a question answered, before you can plan other things that still more things depend on, etc.  
  
That said, ultimately the day of the wedding itself was fantastic, which was the most important thing, so we are very pleased we chose PAHGCC as our venue.

Crystal the catering manager was great. My complaint would be the ceremony site for this venue is not suitable for hot summer days (like on my wedding day) and a big group (like my wedding, about 220 guests). The day of our wedding was super hot/sunny and the patio area does not have any awning/cover for the first couple of rows, a lot of the guests were standing in the back (because there wasn't enough space and it was very sunny). All of my ceremony pictures seemed like there was no one at the wedding. My mother later had a heat stroke because she was sitting up front baking under the sun. Due to the limited space the photographer and videographers were not able to roam around as freely to take the shots they could have taken. A lot of our ceremony pictures are from the same angles because they couldn't go anywhere else. If you have more than 150 guests think about other options for your ceremony site.   
The reception grand ballroom was great. It's spacious, a big open space with great lighting and view. We've gotten quite a few comments about the ballroom was such a great place to host a big wedding. During dinner we knew we couldn't eat our entrees so I asked one of the waitress to save our food for us. At the end of the night we finally had the chance to sit and asked for our food - they threw them out! After talking with Crystal, she was gracious enough to waive the 2 entrees for us. Well, we ended up going to In and Out in my wedding gown that night, it was all good!

We are seven months after our wedding at Palo Alto Hills Golf & Country Club and couldn't be happier! We are delighted with our decision to have both the ceremony and reception at the club. From the first time we visited, we knew it was the place for us!  
  
Their staff was helpful and professional. There were a few minor bumps and miscommunications, but nothing that didn't seem normal. We realized that it's a wedding and there are so many details included that there are going to be a few things that go awry - but nothing major. For example: we were initially told that the groomsmen would be able to play golf, but months after we booked our event their policy changed. In the grand scheme of things... not a big deal.   
  
We enjoyed the tasting in their formal dining area and the food was great! I'd recommend taking detailed notes on everything to ensure everything gets done to your liking. We liked that the cake was included and decided to go with Butterfly Cakes as our choice.   
  
The day of the event was simply amazing! The staff was very professional, helpful and friendly. You could tell that they really wanted to make sure we enjoyed ourselves. They helped me with my dress during pictures, making sure it was in the right place as I sat on the grass, got my husband and I water and champagne for our photo shoot... the little things like that.   
  
Our guests commented on how beautiful the grounds were and literally, they were picture perfect. We paid extra to have the lanterns above the dance floor, which I think added an extra bit of flair to the room. The floor to ceiling windows really let the light and beauty of the grounds in, so other decorations aren't really needed. We had small centerpieces on the tables. The food was wonderful, the evening flowed nicely and we would definitely recommend having your event here.  
  
We are confident in our choice and would do it all over again in the same place. Should you wish to hear more about our experience, just send me a message.  
  
P.S. I think it's interesting how people think they are expensive. And yes, we spent a lot of money there. But, we also found it to be on par with similar venues in the area. We felt that with our wedding we were going to do it once and do it right. You need to pick and choose which services you want to pay for and what is most important to you - chair covers, corkage, etc. It all adds up anywhere you have your wedding.

We were VERY impressed with Chef Orlin, who created an exceptional menu for us and our guests and was willing to customize menu for us to better integrate our cultural backgrounds into the food. He even ordered us a special bottle of wine from my homeland (a very remote spot on the map) as a wedding gift for us.  
  
Palo Alto Hills was the nicest venue we could afford while being on a tight budget. In order to save cost we had a Sunday wedding, which means that our food and beverage minimum was about half of what it would be if we had a wedding on a Saturday. On Sunday they also did not charge anything for the room rental, only cost of food, which was fair (I believe this policy is now changed).  
  
There was an issue with on site coordinators, where one left and another one took over in the middle of the planning Somewhere in the process our wedding ceremony was time slot was booked for another event at the club, which meant that we had to find another place for the ceremony and just do our reception at the Palo Alto Hills. I found out about it by accident, but luckily well in advance before the big day so we were still able to make the arrangements for the ceremony at the different location. Luckily, everything had worked out for beautifully. If you choose this place, make sure you ask that they do not double book your wedding with another event.  
  
Also, I negotiated every little detail and was able reduce fees significantly. We got free chair covers, reduced corkage fee, no cake cutting fee etc. Palo Alto Hills provided special vendor meals so you do not have to pay as much for the vendors as for your guests. For our guests, we decided to go with the buffet option, because it saves costs and eliminates headache of calculating how many of your guests are having "steak" vs. "chicken". Also, they offer children's menu that was much cheaper too.   
  
The place itself is immaculate inside and out, people are nice and food is excellent. I would definitely recommend it to other brides, as long as they go over their contract with a fine tooth comb to insure all is correct and to double check that their wedding is the only event happening at the club that day.
