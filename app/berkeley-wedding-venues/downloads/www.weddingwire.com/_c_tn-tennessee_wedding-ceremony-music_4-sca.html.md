Linda and her fellow musicians entertained our guests recently during our wedding prelude and performed the wedding music for the ceremony with classical music. Then we had them switch gears and they entertained our guests during the cocktail hour with a medley of 80s and more current tunes not traditionally played by a string trio including Dave Matthews, Coldplay, the Bee Gees, Cyndi Lauper, etc. They have a good range and a varied song catalog and it was fun to mix up the music genres. They handled it with ease and were very professional. The guests loved it and it was a nice transition from cocktails into the dinner hour. If you need strings for your wedding or event, definitely give them a call.

Jana’s music took our ceremony to the next level. We entrusted her with the selections and she truly created the most romantic ambiance for our day. The harp was lovely accompanied by the violin. Our favorite part was the Celtic arrangement she created for our first dance. Ethereal and magical would not hesitate to book again.

We first heard and met Eryn at an open house for our wedding venue and I knew that I had to have her! She sounded amazing playing her harp, and it was the perfect choice for our wedding ceremony. Eryn was completely organized throughout the planning processes, making sure she we had all of the important details covered. Eryn and Seryn (violinist), both played for our ceremony and it was amazing! They even learned a special song to play for us during our unity ceremony. Eryn even sang for us during the recessional. Do not hesitate to book Eryn for your wedding or event. She is easy to work with, super flexible, and a super talented musician!!!

Kate's my cousin and I'm so glad it worked out for her to play during my ceremony AND reception. She's amazing. We've lived far apart and I've only had small chances to her play. Thank you so much!!

We hired Rob, along with his violinist, to play music for the ceremony and cocktail hour at my daughter's wedding this past weekend. The duo was amazing. Rob was very responsive throughout. He helped to select all the music and made the day so special. The ceremony music was so elegant and having the live musicians for the cocktail hour was a real treat for our guests. The bride and groom were absolutely thrilled! These folks are so talented and we couldn't be happier with how this enhanced our day. You can't make a better choice than having Rob be part of a wedding celebration!! Highly recommended.

Shelly is a very talented musician and singer. The music song she sang for my ceremony was perfect and had everyone in tears. She plays the piano beautifully as well. I would highly reccommend her to others.
