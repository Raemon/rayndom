My wedding flowers (bouqet, arrangements, flower girl baskets, etc.) were AMAZING! My wedding had a Kate spade theme of black and white with pops of bright pinks with some oranges and yellow mixed it. I brought this idea to her and she made it happen! They were more gorgeous than I could have ever imagined. She helped me pick flowers that would look great and achieve the look I was going for without breaking the bank. Her expertise was much appreciated and she was so easy to work with! Thanks so much Janice!!!!!!

Janice was such a joy to work with. She had the best ideas and was so personable. She did everything from making our centerpieces, boutineers, bridal and bridesmaid bouquets as well as added flowers that we decorated our wedding cake with. She does it all! You cannot go wrong working with this wonderful lady!

Ms. Janice did a wonderful job with the bouquets and the floral arrangements for the tables. She is professional, kind, and very knowledgeable with all things flowers. She helped me put together a beautiful bouquet when I had no idea what I wanted and then when I had to change a few things a few days before my wedding she was more than ready to help. Everything was delivered on time with no errors. I highly recommend Designs By Janice!!

Janice made arrangements for my wedding as well as my bridal portraits. I met her at her shop, showed her pictures of ideas I had, and she came up with beautiful, yet affordable designs! We had great communication throughout the process. She made my bridal/throw/bridesmaid bouquets, flower girl basket, corsages for moms/grandmothers, and boutonnieres for the men. I would highly recommend her!!
