SinfoCovers was recommended by our planner. We really wanted a string quartet for our ceremony. Guillem was SUPER responsive to our many emails. Even though we were quite particular/demanding about the song requests (i.e. specific arrangements, vibe, tempo) and asking to see their rehearsal recordings to confirm that we liked each arrangement, he was always professional and cordial! He was very flexible and accommodating. Not only did they have an extensive repertoire of what they already perform, they took requests for new arrangements. On the actual day, the performance was SUPERB without any flaws! They really elevated the atmosphere. We didn't want any pop or light numbers, but rather a classy and elegant atmosphere - and they totally delivered. They were even better than the live recordings of their rehearsal they sent. We were particular due to our musical background and we were 100% satisfied with their work. Would recommend Guillem and SinfoCovers without reservation to anyone looking for a string quartet!

Emmanuel is a wonderful flute player from La Paz who joined us on the beach during dinner at the Four Seasons. He set up a small area nearby and played for just over an hour, creating a beautiful, relaxed atmosphere. The music was subtle and calming -perfect background accompainment that added to the evening without ever overpowering it. It was a really lovely touch, and both my fiancée and I truly enjoyed it. It made our celebration feel special. Highly recommended.

I want to share my wonderful experience with Vallarta Wedding Music, who provided the music for my religious wedding on January 11th at Parroquia de Nuestra Señora del Refugio in Puerto Vallarta. From the very first contact, they were attentive and professional, always offering suggestions and open to any special requests. Their clear communication and willingness to accommodate our needs made the entire process smooth and enjoyable. On the wedding day, I arrived at the church feeling nervous and rushed, but the moment the music started, I was overwhelmed with emotion. The combination of piano, violin, cello, and an incredible voice created a unique and special atmosphere. Each song was performed with such sensitivity, making the ceremony even more touching and unforgettable. My guests, including my parents, were truly impressed and shared many wonderful comments about the beautiful music. I must especially mention the vocalist, whose performance was absolutely breathtaking and exceeded all expectations. I am deeply grateful to Vallarta Wedding Music for being such an important part of our special day and for their exceptional talent and dedication. I highly recommend them 100%.
