Lulu Event Rentals was easily one of my favorite vendors to work with!! Communicating with Abbey was easy, fast, and she was so helpful and flexible throughout the whole process from inquiry to booking and during wedding week. I am very happy I booed the farmhouse tables and chairs as it totally elevated my space. The delivery, set up, and tear down team was fabulous and fun to work with. Loved everything about Lulu Event Rentals!

Doggy Social was absolutely amazing to work with for our wedding day! Lori Thomas took such great care of our dog, Joji, and made sure he had everything he needed—food, water, and lots of comfort when he got a little anxious about not being right next to us. She even brought a squeaky toy to help him look at the camera during photos, which was such a thoughtful touch. Lori was incredibly reliable and made sure Joji got to every part of the day on time. The end-of-night update once he was safely back home was also so appreciated—it gave us so much peace of mind. We’re so grateful to Doggy Social for helping Joji be part of our big day. Can’t recommend them enough!

Blown away... I googled searched vendors for our private lake home wedding in 2020. Prior to all the chaos we booked a 125 person wedding. Fast forward 8 months following lock down we had tough decisions to make and dread them entirely. Sticking to our original plans we moved forward. Ty and his guys did an absolutely outstanding job the entire wedding. The customization was unique and flexible to our changing needs. The 40x60 tent was his newer option and it shocked me at how beautiful it was with the wood poles + Edison lighting .. GET THE LIGHTS!! I went for the hydride music option creating my own playlists. Hands down the best option.. no funky chicken & skip whatever song I wanted when I wanted. All in all I wish I could get Married every weekend with TY and his team!!!

We used Linen Effects for our décor rentals, and they were absolutely wonderful to work with. Walking into their showroom for the first time can feel overwhelming—they truly have almost everything you can imagine to help you create your dream event. But their team is fantastic about guiding you through the process, giving you space to look, think, and figure out which pieces feel right for your vision. They helped us find special items that made our wedding feel personal and unique. We chose a beautifully detailed tablecloth for our head table to make it stand out, and we used their gorgeous chargers to bring an extra touch of elegance to our guest tables. One of the best parts of meeting with them is being able to see your vision come to life right in front of you. Sometimes you don’t know for sure until you see it set up—and they make that possible. The team at Linen Effects was kind, helpful, and incredibly easy to work with. All of their rentals are beautiful, high-quality, and customizable to fit your event perfectly. We truly enjoyed working with them and would absolutely recommend them!

We rented a beverage fountain and some serving pieces for the reception. The items were clean and beautiful. The staff was efficient.

Lefty’s was great! We had to make several changes throughout the planning process and they were made seamlessly, without complaint. We arrived at the venue and everything was ready to go, just as ordered, and on a holiday, to boot!

The invitations were great and arrived on time. The only problem was that the store was always busy and it took a while for an employee to help us.

We got standard white satin linens for our guest tables and the most stunning champagne-colored Valentina lace tablecloths for our harvest (center) table with an apricot underlay. It tied in beautifully with our romantic, ethereal wedding. Customer service was great and pricing was a little high but they're the largest and most convenient place for linens in the area.
