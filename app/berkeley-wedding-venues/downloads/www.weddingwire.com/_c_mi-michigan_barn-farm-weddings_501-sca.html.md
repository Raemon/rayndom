We had a fall wedding at Castle Farms. Was above and beyond what we could have hoped for. The grounds were spectacular and everything went as planned. Highly recommend!

Our daughter was married on September 28th, at Blossom Pointe and the entire experience from start to finish was absolutely incredible. The venue manager, Ashley, was kind, knowledgeable, and incredibly helpful throughout the whole process. She made everything feel smooth, organized, and truly stress-free. The venue itself has everything you could need: beautiful grounds, thoughtful amenities, and a layout that works perfectly for both the ceremony and reception. The location is also a huge plus. Blossom Pointe is close to I-94, hotels, and plenty of restaurant options, which made everything easy for our guests. And considering all that’s included, the price was genuinely outstanding. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate such a special day. Highly recommend! Thank you so much!

Dear Sonshine Barn Family, I wanted to take a moment to thank you all for the amazing job you did on Megan and I’s wedding on 01 August 2020. We could not have been happier with the overall turnout. Sarah did a wonderful job with overall planning, décor, and vendor recommendations, and Amber did an impeccable job with planning, organization, and day of coordination. The amount of detail that Amber put forth on the day of the wedding, definitely impacted the overall success of the night. To keep my group of groomsmen in line and ensure everything went flawless was no easy task, but she was able to handle it perfectly. Between the two, they made the wedding of our dreams a reality. I was very skeptical of moving the reception from inside the barn, to splitting it inside and outside, but your team made it possible to eliminate any doubt that I may have had. The safety precautions that were implemented, as well as the dual reception areas, removed any doubt that our guests health were largely taken into consideration prior to allowing us to move forward with our ceremony. The setup inside the barn, and outside in the tent, could not have been more perfect. Even though our guests were seated outside for dinner, they were not isolated from the wedding festivities due to the added bench seating inside. Once our wedding moments were captured within the barn, the party commenced in the tent and under the beautiful sky. Overall, the way your team handled the whole COVID-19 situation, constant changes, and governors’ orders to make our day special was nothing short of exceptional. Once again, we would like to thank you for making our dreams come true. Best of luck on your future weddings, and hopefully everyone will have the same happily ever after story as we did.

What a wonderful venue! Kim and Cheryl were very helpful and ready to respond to any needs or questions. We loved the garden area for the ceremony and the pavilion was an awesome fit for the reception. Rustic and beautiful at the same time. We definitely recommend!

We loved this venue! The grounds were amazing for photos. The barn was just repainted and looks amazing. The kitchen for caterers was perfect for this space. We used the house to get ready in and it was incredibly seamless. The price was incredibly reasonable. Definitely recommend if looking for a barn wedding with the ability to bring your own catering service, bar service and what ever else you may need.

Ellis barn was a dream venue. You definitely have to be ready to put in a lot of work as it is a DIY venue, but it was worth every minute and dollar spent. The team was very responsive and helpful before, during, and after our wedding.

We had the most unforgettable wedding experience at Peacock Road Family Farm! From start to finish, the staff went above and beyond to make our special day absolutely perfect. Lorri was a true gem, guiding us through the entire planning process, promptly addressing all our questions and concerns and making sure all my hand made decorations where exactly how I wanted them she made everything a breeze. The hospitality of Farmer Ed was exceptional, and his smoked food right on the farm was nothing short of amazing! Having the the aroma of the food cooking all day on the farm was also a nice touch. The delectable dishes left everyone raving about the food for weeks after the wedding. The attention to detail and delicious flavors truly made our reception an outstanding culinary experience. One of the standout features of this venue was the freedom for our guests to explore and enjoy various activities. From the dance floor to the game yard with a wide array of games and the charming petting farm, there was something for everyone. Our guests loved the opportunity to venture off and create beautiful memories in different corners of the farm. Let's not forget the mouthwatering donuts served after dinner, accompanied by a delightful selection of toppings. It was the perfect sweet treat to end our evening on a high note! Overall, Peacock Road Family Farm is a hidden gem that offers not only a picturesque setting but also a team of exceptional staff who put their heart and soul into making every moment unforgettable. We are forever grateful for the memories created at this wonderful venue, and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique and rustic wedding experience.
