Rabbi Yael was an incredible officiant. She came out from San Diego to be with us in Minnesota for an amazing weekend. Her ceremony was personal, thoughtful, Jewishly literate, and left us and our guests in awe of the power of the moment. She met with me and my wife many times ahead of the ceremony and crafted something personal, reflective, and supremely meaningful for me, my wife, and all of our guests. Anyone would be lucky to work with Rabbi Yael. She had a strong pulse on us as individuals and connected with us deeply as a couple.

Carolyn was incredibly helpful throughout the entire process leading up to our wedding and on the day of. We ended up switching venues at the last minute, and she was extremely flexible and supportive. The ceremony was very emotional, and she guided us with kindness while making sure everything flowed perfectly. She even handled our small mistakes during the ceremony with grace and humor. We truly could not have asked for a better officiant than Carolyn.

I can only give Great Officiants 5 stars. If I could, I would give them 10. They handled our small wedding ceremony at the Cute, Little Wedding Chapel in Long Beach. We could not have been more pleased how it all went. We had planned an outdoor ceremony but rain moved us inside. Great Officiants didn't miss a beat. We had an "Elvis" ceremony and he was GREAT!! His entertaining style, singing and all-around fun attitude took so much of the pressure off of us. All of our dozen family attendees were highly entertained and "Elvis" made them part of the event. Also, we had several distant family and friends watch via ZOOM and the compliments started rolling in.

Christine was absolutely wonderful to work with. She’s very professional and kind, and she made our ceremony everything we hoped for—warm, emotional, and truly personal. She delivered the service beautifully in both English and Spanish, which meant so much to us since some of our family members don’t speak English. Christine met with us beforehand to go over all the details and guided us seamlessly through the entire process. She made us feel comfortable and confident every step of the way. We couldn’t have asked for a better officiant!

We booked Larry to officiate for our small and intimate wedding at Blake Gardens. From the first email, we knew we had chosen the right person. Larry was responsive, professional, and provided us with a ceremony worksheet that made planning stress-free. Larry arrived to the wedding venue first and met with us to make sure all our T's were crossed and i's were dotted. Since we planned our entire wedding ourselves, we wanted to ensure that the officiant we chose could help guide us through our perfect ceremony,; and Larry really delivered. The cherry on top was Larry was sweet and gentle with a great sense of humor. He did great with the guests and showed up as a true professional.

Joann was an absolute joy to work with and created a ceremony that felt truly personal and meaningful. From the start, she made us feel calm, supported, and understood, taking the time to get to know us as a couple. On our wedding day, everything flowed beautifully. Her words were warm, elegant, and sincere, and so many of our guests told us how touching the ceremony was. Joann’s professionalism, kindness, and calm presence made a big difference on such an important day. We couldn’t have asked for a better officiant and highly recommend her. Anastasia & Konstantin

To ensure we had the wedding ceremony of our dreams, Rabbi Barry met with us several times before the wedding. Rabbi Barry was a joy to work with and brought our vision to fruition, which was to have a loving ceremony that was inclusive to all of our guests. Rabbi Barry made the day very special for us, and was a hit with everyone. He is unique and one of a kind, and will bring a wonderful united spiritual dimension to your wedding, no matter what your faith.

My husband and I are very happy that we picked Jon as our wedding officiant. During our initial meeting he walked us thought the whole process. He spent time understanding my husband and I and prepared a custom ceremony for us that even included some Greek traditional. Truly grateful to have Jon be a part of our special day.
