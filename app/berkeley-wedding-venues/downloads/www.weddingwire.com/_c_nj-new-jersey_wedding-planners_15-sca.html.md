Attended an event planned and organized by event masters. Everything was beautifully executed from the organized staff to the seamless transitions. The special effects they added really made the night that more magical. The vibes were great and the energy was high. That said it was a 10 out of 10 experience.

We had the absolute best experience working with Cristina as our wedding planner. From the very beginning, Cristina was an absolute pleasure to work with — warm, patient, and genuinely invested in bringing our vision to life. She is incredibly professional and consistently went above and beyond for us, always generous with her time and attention. Cristina crafted a wedding design that felt uniquely us, offering thoughtful guidance whenever we needed it while still making sure every detail reflected our personalities and style. Her vendor recommendations were phenomenal; we felt confident with every choice because she only works with the very best. One of Cristina’s greatest strengths is her mastery of the wedding timeline. She is remarkably detailed and organized, and her expertise ensured our entire wedding day flowed seamlessly from start to finish. We truly had nothing to worry about and she had it all handled! We are so grateful to have had Cristina by our side throughout this process. She made planning enjoyable and stress-free, and we couldn’t imagine our wedding without her!!

My husband and I were referred to Myrna and Times of Your Lives by friends who had gotten married a couple of years ago. From the day we met Myrna to the actual wedding day, she was nothing but helpful, organized and wonderful. The moment we started working with her, she was always there when we needed her, met with us whenever we wanted, had virtual meetings throughout the entire process, right up until the week of the wedding. She created a personalized profile for my husband and I, and a personalized Pinterest board that she would always send me ideas and inspiration for our day. Myrna would touch based often through text and email to check in to see if we needed anything. Myrna came to our rehearsal two nights before the big day to help set up everything and go over the timeline with our family and bridal party and she even took items and decor with her in her own car to bring to the venue. She was always accessible and always made time for us. Her wedding timeline was extremely detailed and included everything down to the very minute. Myrna attended most of our vendor meetings either in-person or virtually, and if not, we always spoke after the meetings to touch base with her. The day of the wedding, she met me at the hotel to see us in the morning to go over final details, and then she went over to our church to set up and then to the venue. As I was getting ready, she sent me pictures of how she set everything up-which was absolutely flawless and made me so, so excited to get the party started! We are so happy we went with Myrna and her team. My husband and I had a beautiful day, and we have to thank Myrna and her husband for being there with us every step of the way! Myrna wasn't just a "day-of" coordinator. She was with us from DAY One of hiring her. If you are looking for a wedding planner/coordinator who will take the stress off of the bride and groom and their families, Myrna and Times of Your Lives are the right choice! She worked with our vision and helped bring our dream wedding to life. Not only did we meet someone who we could trust, we made a life-long friend out of it as well! :) Thank you so much for making this process so magical day! XO, Carina and Jonathan

We would recommend The Wedding Plan & Company 10000/10! Joy Gomez was our month of coordinator and she was absolutely fantastic. Nina Lee was her assistant on wedding day. Joy made us feel so at ease, taken care of and supported throughout the entire process. From our questions at all hours, to changes in plans, contacting vendors, to organizing the timeline to the minute (& so much more!!!), we never once felt stress on the wedding day and that’s all thanks to Joy Gomez and Nina Lee. Hire them!!!

Still floating from the most perfect day and we owe so much of that to Kristen. She was truly a key player in bringing everything together. With less than 2 months until my wedding day and overwhelmed by the last minute details, the stars aligned and Kristen came highly recommended by a colleague! Being a local to Ocean City, she brought invaluable insight, amazing connections, and a deep understanding of the area that made all the difference. Kristen went above and beyond, even gaining special access to the boardwalk rides so we could capture the most incredible and memorable photos. As we got closer to the wedding, I really needed someone to take the finalization of details completely off my plate and Kristen did exactly that with calm confidence and care. Because of her organization and dedication, we were able to fully enjoy the day without stress. Our wedding was everything we dreamed of and more, and we will be reminiscing about it forever. We are endlessly grateful. 📸: https://www.styledpink.com/

I hired Brina for day of coordination for our big day. We had the event at home, 45 people, just immediate family. Brina and I spoke the month before the wedding to make sure I was organized and had a clear list of tasks that I had to complete before the day. She had a warm, positive vibe, I felt comfortable with her immediately. It was also very clear from our first convo that she is well organized and has done this before. She reminded me of a bunch of things I had not thought of. It was a very helpful meeting for me and I felt a lot less stressed after it, even though I had more on my to-do list. I also discussed with her that we have 5 kids (teenagers) from previous marriages that we somehow wanted to include but could not figure out how. She suggested doing a sand ceremony (which I had not heard of before) and sent me links. I modified it a bit to include 2 other members of our families as well (so we had 9 layers of sand in the end). It turned out to be the focus of the whole ceremony and was super well received by our guests and the kids! Thank you Brina! The week before the wedding we met again to firm up details and she told me I should think of her as my personal assistant on the wedding day. The day of Brina arrived early and after a quick tour of the house and where everything would take place she completely took over the flow of the event, the food service, welcoming guests, wiping up spills, coordinating with the photographer, shepherding us to the alter for the ceremony, basically anything that needed to be done to keep the event running smoothly and make it successful. She also made sure my champagne glass was filled 😆 leaving me to be able to focus on my guests and myself. She was so efficient I practically felt like a guest! After the event when my husband and I went to clean up we had the lovely surprise of realizing Brina had already done most of it!! She was worth every penny. A few of my guests came up to me at the end of the event and unsolicited told me they thought she was fantastic. ❤️ I highly recommend using Brina as your wedding coordinator no matter the size of your wedding!

They handle every aspect with such professionalism and grace, ensuring that the timeline runs smoothly and allowing me to focus on capturing those candid, beautiful moments. If you’re looking for a wedding planner who brings both elegance and efficiency to the table, Dluxe Events should be at the top of your list. Highly recommend working with them!

From the very first meeting, we knew Eileen was the planner for us. She understood immediately that we wanted our wedding to be about the guests, the people who have supported us and nurtured us our whole lives. She never forgot that throughout the planning process. She helped us meet with and vet multiple caterers, and her insight helped us choose the exact right one for us. She was fluent in the language of every vendor and she translated our vision into every aspect of the event, staying on top of large and small details alike (table assignments and napkin folds). We had some unconventional needs related to timing and setup, and Eileen made it all work. Her day-of coordination was essential, too, and our ceremony went better than we ever imagined. Throughout the process, Eileen was readily available to us and responded quickly to our questions. She explained all the ramifications of decisions we needed to make so that we could feel well-informed to make them. She helped us feel confident and well-prepared for each phase of the wedding, and, most importantly, she helped our guests feel as treasured and special as they are to us.
