My husband and I chose Michelle to do our elopement because we wanted someone that accepted LGBTQ+ marriages and someone that made us feel comfortable on our big day; Michelle exceeded our expectations. We booked her to be our ordiant about 10 days before the day we wanted to get married, and she accommodated us in so many ways. She made the process so smooth and easy, and was so eager to help us in anyway that she could. We told her what all we wanted and she gave us exactly that+ more. The ceremony was so intimate and peaceful, and she took away all of our stress. Thank you so much Michelle!

Kim made our ceremony personal and intimate. She was very responsive and thoughtful. It can be overwhelming eloping (truly just the two of you) so we really appreciated her making our ceremony so memorable. It is exactly what we hoped for!

Michael was awesome! He was very flexible, very understanding of our requests, and made our day extremely special for us. We couldn't recommend Michael more as your officiant. He went above and beyond what we expected and was extremely pleasant to work with in the process. We couldn't be happier with Michael and his work!

My fiance and I were going to a friends wedding in Oahu 4th of July weekend. We decided the day before we left that we wanted to get married privately on a beach in the North Shore while we were there. I called a few people with no luck but Eleanor's friend had told her about our situation and she called me that day to see if she could help us . I explained to her exactly what we wanted and in a few days we met her at an amazing beach on the north shore of Oahu and all our dreams of an economically sound, private, small, quick and beautiful wedding ceremony came true. I would definitely recommend Eleanor's services to anyone wanting to get married in Oahu she really listens to what you want and delivers just that. Mahalo Eleanor!

We found Rev. Jesse after it turned out that Pia Aluli couldn't perform our ceremony. He did a wonderful, memorable job, and was just wonderful--a very sweet man who brought a peaceful, beautiful aloha to the entire day. We're very grateful.

Alice was a wonderful, calming presence to our wedding. She made everyone feel at ease and was completely flexible with our ceremony, vows, and our additions. She took time to meet with us twice before the wedding and listened and connected with us, making our ceremony much more thoughtful and poignant. We loved Alice and would highly recommend her.

I don't think anyone can be nicer than Rev. Cain. He was very courteous and made the wedding rehearsal and wedding day very special for us. He was very responsive and an amazing person. he suggested we do a Lei ceremony for honoring our parents and it was truly a beautiful gesture which we would remember always. Thank you Chris.

We were so pleased with Rev. Nelson. He was absolutely a highlight of our wedding. We organized his participation over email and a couple of telephone calls. He was very generous in being willing to meet with us a few days before our wedding, after we arrived on the island, to discuss the plan and go over the details. His calm, flexible demeanor put us at ease immediately, and he was very open and accommodating with the elements we wanted to be included in the ceremony. The ceremony was exactly what we had hoped for – a balance between sophisticated and casual, meaningful and entertaining – we had wanted a traditional Christian ceremony with local Hawaiian elements and non-religious readings - and that is exactly what we had. Many of our guests commented on how much they enjoyed his ceremony and I just wish he had more time to spend with us. (he is so popular, he had to leave immediately after our ceremony to officiate another). We feel very blessed to have had Rev. Nelson officiate our ceremony and I highly recommend him. Many thanks to Rev. Nelson, Claire and Jason

I hired Kahu Wendell Silva for our wedding and can say I am so glad I did. I coordinated everything from Texas and had no issues, his wife Sharon coordinated everything. We met with Kahu Silva over the phone to go through the ceremony (our arrival date from ceremony did not give us time to meet in person). He did get to know us, learned we were Catholic and offered to add in different bible verses which we happily accepted. Kahu Silva did a very beautiful traditional Hawaiian wedding ceremony and is so genuine and sincere. He did the ceremony in English with some parts in Hawaiian with a beautiful translation of his words and the meaning of marriage. We also chose to include a unity water ceremony which was so very special. We had a small wedding and were very happy with our decision. Our photographer even commented on how beautiful our ceremony was. They were also very flexible in the location and Sharon recommended a very reasonable florist.

Reverend Kristine was wonderful. She helped arrange our wedding from out of state and provided excellent recommendations locally in Kauai. Professional yet warm caring service. Thank you for a beautiful experience!
