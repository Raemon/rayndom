The skybox was absolutely amazing. Beyond what we could have imagined. We only viewed the skybox and immediately had no interest in seeing any other venue. We were sold just by the view, flexibility you have to create the wedding of your dreams and service we had from Amanda and Cindy. We are so happy to look back on our wedding day and forever be happy we chose the skybox.

The Oviatt staff was fantastic and made our happily ever after event such a special moment for us. They worked with us on our bar menu and gave us a lot of freedom with making the space very intimate and personal. Being under the city lights of Los Angeles made this venue such a romantic tribute to the city that me and my wife fell in love in and grew up in. I'd recommend touring the venue before hand and pick a date that offers a lot of natural light. Thank you to the Oviatt for making an unforgettable night! Also look up Anna Luna with Festie Co. (Fantastic coordinator/planner!) \- Jasmin and Aron

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ My husband and I celebrated our November wedding at Grey LB, and we couldn't have been happier with our choice. Budget & Value: Grey LB offers incredible value, especially for intimate weddings (we had 80 guests). The venue's flexibility to bring in our own vendors helped us stay within budget while getting exactly what we wanted. They provide 75 ceremony chairs and all reception tables, which meant significant savings on rentals. Professionalism & Support: Vanessa, the venue manager, was exceptional throughout the entire process. She was responsive, detail-oriented, and genuinely invested in making our day work for us and our specific needs. The team's flexibility and willingness to accommodate our timeline made the planning process smooth and stress-free. The Space: The venue offers beautiful versatility with three distinct areas - the courtyard (perfect for our ceremony with that gorgeous grey concrete wall), the clubhouse (ideal for cocktail hour), and the upstairs reception space with courtyard views. The industrial-chic aesthetic was exactly what we wanted. Bottom Line: Grey LB is perfect for couples who want a beautiful, flexible space with a professional team behind them, all at a price point that doesn't break the bank. Highly recommend for anyone planning a Long Beach wedding!

Harbor view loft was an amazing wedding venue. We had our wedding there in November and their staff were so helpful, attentive, and always answered all of our questions. Our wedding coordinator was amazing! They made our vision come to life and really cared about all the small details! Harbor view loft had so many options to make our wedding so easy and stress free, as we did not live in SD, it was a breeze to communicate and plan stress free experience! They also had wonderful vendors to use that know the venue! We can’t thank all of them enough!

Jeff and his team are amazing. I could not be more thrilled with how they handled my wedding. Everything went off without a hitch! Jeff is exceptionally accommodating, understanding and patient. The location site is breathtaking. Floor to ceiling glass windows looking out onto gorgeous blue water, sailboats, and hills in the distance. From the balcony, you have a beautiful view of the San Francisco city skyline. The food is delicious. My guests still comment about the food and hors d'oeuvre selection. The service was impeccable. There was never an empty wine glass in sight :) Overall, two thumbs up. Best place ever.

Franciscan Gardens is an amazing venue! The setup is absolutely gorgeous with the greenery covering the high walls, the string lighting, the fountain, and the pergola. The food was catered by 24 Carrots and it was extremely delicious. Elizabeth, Anna, Nasime, Nicole were who I worked with and they were very communicative and easy to work with. They are clearly professionals who are experienced in this field. They were very easy to work with and were very kind when I would have to make adjustments. The location is also fabulous. It's on a walkable street so there's bars, restaurants, boutiques, etc. all within walking distance. There's also a parking lot right next to it so your guests can just park there for the wedding (I believe $2/hr or $20 for the whole day). It's a also 30 minute drive to SNA airport, and there's numerous hotels within walking distance or close driving distance - very convenient for guests. It's a very popular wedding venue, so many of the wedding vendors have previously worked with Franciscan Gardens - my vendors were all experienced with the venue and worked seamlessly with one another. It is on a busy street and near the train tracks so just be aware of that. They also just renovated the bridal suite and it is SO gorgeous. It looks amazing for the getting ready photos. In terms of pricing - I feel like it's pretty comparable to other OC venues. I felt that the base pricing is very reasonable, it's more of a matter of how many add-ons and extras you want, that's where it really starts to get pricey. Overall great experience! Pair the venue with some nice florals and it is truly a dream! We added hanging wisteria courtesy of Ruffle Effect and it was gorgeous. PC: Cassy Smith Photography

We hosted our wedding of 100 at SVCC. We worked with Cheryl and she was amazing throughout the whole process. Our budget wasn't extremely high, but Cheryl assured us they would make it work. Not only did she make it work, but it was way less than expected. Not one detail was overlooked. The day of the wedding Cheryl really took charge and made sure everything ran smoothly. The entire staff was extremely professional, helpful, and went above and beyond. We got so many compliments on the venue, food, and staff. Would definitely recommend this venue for any special event.

A stunning, spacious yet intimate rooftop venue is on top of Andaz. The perfect spot for a wedding with a view. As wedding planners, we work at a different venue every weekend so we can’t speak highly enough about the team at this hidden downtown gem. Despite unforeseen circumstances with an outside rental company, the Andaz staff led by Valerie, Lee, Ricky & Charlie seamlessly supported the vendor team and with the kindest demeanor. Through extreme professionalism, communication and adaptability, their team took any hiccup with stride. The entire team ran dinner, wine and champagne service with ease despite seating and guest changes. No matter what we needed to execute a beautiful reception, the Andaz team supported the couple, guests and us every step of the way. The bride and groom will have the fondest memories of their wedding at Andaz! Highly recommended!
