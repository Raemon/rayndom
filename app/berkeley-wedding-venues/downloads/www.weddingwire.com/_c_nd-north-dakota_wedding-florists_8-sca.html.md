They made the whole experience amazing! I worked with Amy who is the 4th generation owner of the place. I didn’t know exactly what I wanted for my bouquet so I just showed her stuff off of my Pinterest page and colors I wanted and it was the most beautiful piece of art! They took care of everything and let me come look at the flowers the day before! Seriously work with these guys you won’t regret it!

Floret & Foliage provided decorative floral arrangements, centerpieces, bouquets, and boutonnieres for my wedding and everything was absolutely gorgeous! The flowers were fresh and stayed that way for HOURS! Considering it was 105 degrees that day, that’s very impressive! We did have an indoor wedding and ceremony, but you could still feel the humidity inside. The flowers were stunning and full of bright pink colors and sunflowers, exactly what I wanted and more. Allison was great to work with and always professional and so kind! Even when I got a little panicked towards the end! I highly recommend Allison and Floret & Foliage for any of your floral needs. Brides, trust me when I say, you WANT one of her bouquets! Thank you Allison for everything you did for us. It was all wonderful!
