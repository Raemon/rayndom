I am a wedding coordinator and Cavallo Point is one of my favorite venue in the Bay Area.  
Beside the beautiful location and the different possibilities the venue can offer for a wedding, I had the chance to work many time with their venue coordinator Faustine Thomas and I highly recommend her to any bride to be. She provides professional and thorough services. Faustine is an amazing venue coordinator and truly care about her work. She was there to handle any issues that would arise during the wedding planning and the wedding day.   
Faustine is extremely detailed oriented and she made sure that all the details and events we planned went as smooth as possible.   
A lot of venue coordinators do not put that much effort and care into their work so it is refreshing to be able to work with somebody like Faustine.... It makes the events so much more fun and wonderful for the couple!  
There is alway a lot of logistic organization when it comes to a wedding-- she held it all together and is always on point.   
I could not be more pleased with her help as a venue coordinator, and as a person. Cavallo Point is a gorgeous venue with a great coordinator!

Fuastine & Lloraine at Cavallo Point made our Wedding Weekend an amazing experience! Everyone at Cavallo was very easy to work with and incredibly accommodating. Our family was able to spend the whole weekend with us to celebrate and the whole event couldn't have gone smoother. Everyone was raving about how lovely the space and location was, and most importantly how amazing the food was! Thanks again for helping us make our day to special!

My husband and I picked Cavallo Point to get married at because of it's beauty, location, reputation, quality of service, proximity to San Francisco and Sausalito, and all inclusive services it provides. The chapel is so charming, and a simple walk down the hill to the reception venue. The reception venue (Callippe Ballroom) is a great space with tall ceilings, dramatic windows, cool modern chandeliers, nicely sized rooms yet that flexible enough to layout in whatever you want. Overall, my husband and I, as well as our family and friends, loved Cavallo Point, and had a wonderful time at our wedding.

The most magical venue

We hosted our wedding at Sula at Cavallo Point. If you want a beautiful wedding with delicious food at a great price - book Sula. Helen Byrne was amazing to work with. We had 70 guests, which is the max the room can hold but the space is beautiful and requires 0 additions to make it a beautiful space.

After looking all over the bay area, Napa and Sonoma wine countries. I choose Cavallo Point Lodge because of its scenic views, historic buildings, and friendly staff. We had a two celebration over Halloween weekend. A costume dance party in the Calipe room on Saturday, and on Sunday a ceremony in the chapel and a quick lunch in the tidewater room. Everything on Saturday went great. The food was a real hit and the bar had an awesome assortment of high mixers.   
  
I wanted to make some changes to the menu on Sunday and they accommodated all of them. My only complaints are about the the food for Sunday's lunch was cold and our lovely wedding cake was a little dry. A lot of my guest were chefs, wine people and foodies, many of them were very disappointed in lunch and the state of the pumpkin wedding cake.
