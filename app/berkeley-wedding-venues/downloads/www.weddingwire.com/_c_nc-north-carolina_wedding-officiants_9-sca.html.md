My husband and I had the pleasure of working with Yvette who officiated our wedding. We received so many compliments about her from our wedding guests. She is very personable and so thoughtful when she writes her ceremonies Most of our guests assumed she had known us as a couple for a long time, even though we had only just met weeks before the wedding. As someone who hates being the center of attention, she made me feel so comfortable. Our guests were laughing, crying and smiling the whole time. Could not recommend her more!

I planned my wedding to take place in the OBX (my husband and I are from New England), and this company has it down to a science. Neither my guests nor I had to lift a finger during the day of the wedding (I did not have a wedding planner), and I Do OBX was fabulous to work with. They made sure everything was setup on the beach for the Ceremony and took everything down afterwards. Everything was seamless, and I would definitely recommend their services for a Ceremony.

I highly recommend Rev Jay Bowman! He made everything stress-free and easy. You will love his personality he really wants to make your day perfect. The website is so helpful he even gave me ideas I didn't think of. I texted him a snow storm was coming we could do it another time he said he would be there and he drove in the storm to the top of the mountain. You will not be disappointed he made my day perfect!

Susan officiated our October mountain wedding and brought a friendly, calm presence to the ceremony. She has a strong, clear voice that worked really well for an outdoor setting, and the ceremony felt warm and approachable. We appreciated her being part of our celebration.

Stephanie was our officiant from Love & Wisdom and she was AMAZING!! We had a meeting and went over our love story and she created two totally customized ceremonies for us to choose from! She even took the curveball we threw at her - we wanted to take a shot at the end of our ceremony (that's how we met) and she made it one of our favorite parts of the whole day! Definitely recommend if you are looking for a personalized ceremony.

Choosing to have Kevin officiate our elopement on Topsail beach was one of our best decisions! He was incredibly responsive throughout the entire process. The pricing was affordable and comparable to other officiants in the area. Kevin was incredibly upbeat and passionate about what he does. He genuinely seemed excited and happy for us. Our ceremony was perfect. He was able to personalize it to us, and it felt just right. If you are looking for an officiant for your special day, I can assure you that Kevin will make you feel special, excited, and at ease.

Rev Kathi was the best officiant my husband & I could have asked for. She met with us a few times throughout the process, not just to guide us through the wedding process but also got to know us. She was professional and prepared for both the rehearsal and day of. Although Rev Kathi was great throughout the entire process, her story-telling ability during our ceremony was phenomenal. We had several of our guests tell us how great she was and how much they enjoyed her ceremony. I strongly recommend booking Rev. Kathi!

From his welcoming energy and professionalism from our initial video call, I knew Rev. Perry Hardison was the perfect choice for us. He guided us with the vows and ceremony, allowing us to make it exactly what we wanted as well as incorporating cultural wedding elements we requested. His years of expertise and experience was highlighted when we met him in person at rehearsal where he gave us recommendations for us and our families to create the perfect ceremony. We received so many compliments on the wedding day from family and guests on how great Rev. Perry was. He was such a warm presence on our wedding day, we can't thank him enough!

Where do I even begin? I was a bride and Christina, Anna, and Melissa were super heroes during our wedding planning process and day of for our wedding 11/17/24. We booked their event coordination package where they come in the last two months and take over a lot of the admin duties to take stress off your plate, but they went above and beyond for us. We had a hiccup early on in wedding planning where we needed to go our separate ways with a vendor, and they managed to get us through that without much fuss or ruckus. Anna was such a joy to work with and was my biggest cheerleader throughout everything!! If I recommend anything post-wedding, it's this. It's so worth it. Thank you, Christina to your team, and Anna. We loved you guys.
