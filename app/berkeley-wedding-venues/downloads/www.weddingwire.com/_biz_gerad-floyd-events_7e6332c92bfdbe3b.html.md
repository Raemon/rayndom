We Went to Gerad!

Stop the search. You've found your guy. Gerad will take care of you. In a sea of five star reviews, please read below on why this man is so special.  
  
We came to Gerad under some challenging circumstances: we had a wedding originally planned in New Orleans (in September) which was canceled due to Hurricane Ida. We were discouraged, but decided that we really wanted to get married by the end of the year and ended up trying to plan something in Austin, TX, as we had a friend who had some wedding connections there.   
  
Our friend introduced us to Gerad, and we were no longer discouraged.  
  
Gerad single-handedly helped us plan a wedding from scratch in under three months. He opened up his little black book and recommended a full suite of A-list vendors that made our day absolutely perfect. He meticulously went through every detail of the schedule, creative things, and kept us excited throughout the entire process. He is the most caring, professional, and loving individual we've had the pleasure of working with when planning our wedding. We can confidently say, without Gerad, our wedding weekend wouldn't have been as full of joy, love, and excitement as it was. We are sad that our time together has come to an end, but hope that people looking for a planner can experience all this man has to offer.

Gerad is great, worth his weight in gold!

Gerad is worth his weight in gold. Well, he's a small guy, so maybe even MORE!! I think his core strength is as a logistician. He could mobilize an army in a foreign land, I'm sure, and do it with a smile on his face. So, executing my daughter's non-cookie cutter wedding with grace and always a smile, was a breeze for him. * Gerard was always available to answer questions; never made us feel as though we were imposing. * He had vendor suggestions and recommendations, but we did all the initial vendor meetings and selections because we wanted to. * Gerad managed all the vendor communications once selected, and especially in the last weeks leading up to the event. * He created and managed the "day of" timeline line a military general (but with a smile...) When a small thing didn't happen exactly according to how we'd imagined in our minds, he let us know it was OK, this is normal, and not to worry, which was very calming. You can't go wrong with Gerad!

Our best asset and trusted partner from start to finish! 

Gerad was our rock, our trusted partner, and our best asset in achieving our goals for our wedding.  
  
  
We loved working with Gerad from the moment we met him. He was a swiss army knife from start to finish.   
  
He just has that magic touch: the right amount of being going deep with you when it matters and that ability to steer you clear of a mistake or going too far down a rabbit hole.   
  
We selected a month-of coordination services package that included a few advanced planning meetings. Frankly, Gerad was involved from day 1 all the way through to our wedding day--well beyond the scope of duty.   
  
Prior to the month of our wedding, he made himself available for wisdom and institutional knowledge via email. He was open to answer any question, even before his “month of” duties started. This availability helped us make smart decisions and helped reduce his work during the month of the wedding when he took over. Everybody won.  
  
The month of our wedding arrived, and Gerad transitioned from trusted advisor and collaborator to director and orchestrator. We began texting, and he really stepped in- we knew he had it all under control.  
  
  
At our ceremony rehearsal, Gerad had the perfect command of the crowd. His sharp wit, ability to get people to focus, and mastery of highlighting the important parts of the ceremony really assisted.  
  
Finally, on the day of our wedding he was a master. Armed with a satchel of wedding day emergency items-- you could count on him to get people to the right places, orchestrate every one of the vendors, re-hang a light or fan, lay out flowers and decor, shift a cake table, field a tent emergency, place things in the right rooms, or herd family members. He was always in the right place at the right time.  
  
Oh count the many ways Gerad was awesome. Beyond this all he really made us feel so special on our day. He was our best hire. You won't be disappointed!

Hire Gerad! He's awesome

Gerad was invaluable during the wedding planning process. He kept us on track and on time when making all of our decisions. He was patient and professional every step of the way. On the day of the wedding, I did not have to worry about a thing. He kept the day moving seamlessly. Thank you so much, Gerad!

Groovy Love Bash

GERAD IS AMAZING! I can't stress this enough about how good he is at his job!! Leading up to the wedding, he was very responsive with emails/texts, took incredible notes at our meetings, and made sure we were prepared for our wedding. He helped with many last minute changes the week of our wedding and was LITERALLY INCREDIBLE on our wedding day. There is no way the day would have been as great as it was if Gerad wasn't there. Besides the fact that Gerad is super helpful, he's also a very easy person to get along with that by our wedding he felt like our friend and we miss him now that it's all over!! Everybody needs Gerad as their wedding coordinator! 10/10 would recommend him

An exceptionally organized and responsive wedding planner

Gerad was fantastic! We retained him about nine months before our wedding, and throughout the process Gerad was responsive to any and all questions we had and provided great advice to us regarding things ranging from wedding-day decor to potential vendors. Importantly, he really paid attention to the choices we made (or were trying to make). At one point, he saved us from a potential photography nightmare by interceding when we almost went a bad direction with a potential vendor. Gerad was also exceptionally well organized, providing us clear information concerning pending steps and the payments due to our vendors. Most importantly, on the big day itself Gerad was invaluable. He assisted with decorations, took care of communications with the vendors and site, and made sure we timely made the rounds during the reception so that we stuck somewhat to our original wedding-day timeline. Gerad, thank you for everything you did for us!
