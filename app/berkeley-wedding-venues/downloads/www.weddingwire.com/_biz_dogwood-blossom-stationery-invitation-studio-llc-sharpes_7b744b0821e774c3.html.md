Incredible designer and awesome to work with!

Denise is a class act, and absolutely on top of it. Her work is stunning and she comes up with ideas that help fit within your budget. We worked with her on our invitations and all paper goods for wedding day. She completed proofs to make sure it was exactly what we wanted. Everything was absolutely perfect and we can't thank her enough for her patience and hard work!!

Beautiful wedding creation

Denise is extremely creative and truly gave us a one of a kind Seating Board Display and these gorgeous gold mirror place cards. Her creation was so amazing it was a hit with our guests for a great photo opportunity. Denise is timely, professional and seems to work great under pressure. I would highly recommend her.

I used Dogwood Blossom Stationary for my April wedding at the Waldorf Astoria in Orlando. In March, I had a few tasks to still complete in a short period of time regarding decor details for the ceremony and cocktail hour as well as a custom seating chart for the reception. Denise didn't hesitate with the short notice as she quickly hit the ground running which I greatly appreciated. I had a destination wedding so Denise and I chatted through my wish list of items and we also walked through pictures of the linens, flowers and chargers that I was using as Denise wanted to clearly understand what it was about those details I loved so she can ensure she captured my vision perfectly. When Denise email me with my mockup, she exceeded my expectations as she nailed it in one shot especially my seating chart as it wasn't an easy one and required some out of the box creativity. I highly recommend Dogwood Blossom Stationary as Denise was very easy to work with especially with me being out of town and relying on email/phone communication, she has many options to choose from to work with your budget that all look amazing, and her designs are high end and gorgeous! Thanks again Denise!

Denise at Dogwood Blossom Stationery created the most beautiful pieces for our wedding--I am SO glad we used her. I gave her a few general ideas of the theme I wanted to go with for our day-of pieces, and she ran with them and created gorgeous and fun designs for our welcome cards, place cards, menus, mirror signage, etc. I wish there was a way to upload examples of her work because it was just perfect! I had multiple guests comment to me about how much they loved the paper products. She also did all this on a tight timeline! She was super responsive and understanding with each small edit I had--really wonderful to work with. I highly recommend Dogwood Blossom. Denise is professional, incredibly talented, and can be counted on to produce some beautiful touches to your wedding aesthetic!

If you are reading this, do yourself a favor and hire Denise at Dogwood Blossom. She was amazing from start to finish.   
  
We live in Tallahassee and quoted a few people in town and looked online. We met Denise at a small wedding showcase and we were very impressed but based on her out of town location and skills we thought she might be over budget. It turns out for what you are paying, which was similar among all the vendors, you get so much more value, customization and personal touch with Denise than with anyone else we contacted.  
  
Most other vendors worked with preset invitation suites, even print shops. Not Denise. She had a robust selection of papers and design ideas. She met with us while we were in Orlando planning but we did the lions share of work over the phone. She gave us samples. She tweaked when we were unsure. My husband is super picky about paper quality and Denise delivered thick paper or fused paper together to create the heft and look we wanted. We received so many compliments on our invitations. Our guest were impressed. Our parents were thrilled.   
  
When it came time to do day of signage, she blew us away with beautiful ideas and everything was so cohesive.   
  
My husband is very exacting and detail oriented. He liked things perfect. He has plan A, B and C ready to go at all times. When it came to making our sign for our sweetheart table we wanted it to be round and Denise warned she would have to do that free-hand. My husband's exact words, "it's Denise, you know it will be perfect". And it was. It was perfect and finished off our table beautifully.   
  
We did personalized menu cards and she dealt with all the menu variations and vegan plates with ease. Each and every guest had their exact perfect menu. She made sure of it.   
  
I'm sure we drove her nuts with all our thoughts and variations but she never lost her cool. She was a professional. In fact, she was a reassuring presence during our planning. We knew we could always count on her.

Denise is truly amazing! I would highly recommend booking her!  
We have used her for all of our paper needs including: Save the Dates, Bridal Shower, Invitations, Rehearsal invitations Wedding Passports (Programs), Menus, and small signage.  
  
Denise met with me personally and got to know my style and from that she was able to create a series of beautiful invitations that set the tone for the event and all tied in together. She also created an crest for my husband and I that we used on everything we sent out.  
  
She is a very gifted designer and extremely reasonably priced for the quality and personalization that you are getting! Denise also did our welcome boxes for our wedding which was such a big help since we were having a destination wedding. She put all the boxes together and made sure they looked pretty--complete with welcome letter, bus information, and a cute door hanger for our guests rooms, and then delivered them to the hotel for me!   
  
Overall I cannot recommend Denise more to anyone! And we will definitely be using her for our Thank you notes and any other special events we may have in the future!

It truly was a pleasure to work with Denise at Dogwood Blossom on our invitations.  
They came out better than we could have hoped for.  
Denise was professional, fun and so very creative.  
The custom designs she created are stunning and captured exactly what we had wished for.  
We are so happy with our invitations and Dogwood Blossom's work. Thank you!

Thanks to our planner, Brandee Gaar, we were introduced to Dogwood for our daughters  
Invitations. She was looking for a very specific black and white stripe look and had not found   
an affordable printer to make them. Denise not only made exactly what she wanted but also  
did all the day of printing, made the welcome boxes for the out of town hotel guests and novelty  
cootie catchers for the reception place settings. It really made a difference having the same beautiful  
fonts on all the printing.   
It was a huge piece of mind to have everything ( including addressing and mailing invites) done by   
Dogwood Blossom's. Highly recommend!

We hired Denise with Dogwood Blossom Stationary very early in the wedding planning process. It was the best decision we made. Denise came up with a modern and contemporary vision for our save-the-dates and invitations that ended up helping us style the wedding overall. As we are not very creative people ourselves, I cannot imagine what our wedding would have been like had we not brought Denise on board early on.  
  
We used Denise with everything on paper: invitations, save-the-dates, thank-you cards, custom menus, various signs around the reception and ceremony, a guest sign-in poster, cake topper, programs. Everything was extremely well done, fully 100% customized, and truly made our wedding unique.   
  
Honestly, hiring a custom designer for paper goods is naturally going to be more expensive than buying things online. But what a world of difference it made---not just in the paper goods themselves, but in really tying everything together and making our wedding look like it was a professionally-designed event.  
  
In every category of vendor, we hired who we were told was the best in town. But out of all of them, Dogwood Blossom was truly the one we could not have done without.
