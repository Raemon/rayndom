Getting married at Blue Vista was seriously like a movie. The venue is so naturally beautiful. The views, the glass windows, the natural lighting… I could go on forever. The owner, Drew, was super helpful for not only the day of, but a good portion of the wedding planning process as well. I have nothing but great things to say!

I will say that first off Janelle at the Arboretum so so flexible I had some things come up in 2019 and had to postpone my dates and they had to problem working with me. She was very patient and accommodating. The arboretum is beautiful place. We had our wedding ceremony on 8/8/2020. and it was georgous weather. We had our ceremony out by the bridge and them reception in doors.my biggest thing was have a back up plan if the weather was bad and Janelle helped give me have peace of mind that the tables can be orgained to accommodate a ceremony indoors than turn chair for reception. Multiple different floor plans. I appreciate everything they did for us. They made it easy and less stressful. We planned for about 100 guests and with covid only about 50 were able to be there but regardless we could accommodate. Alisha and Scott Johnson

Absolutely love the location of my wedding and pictures during the fall at Sedgwick County Park. The grounds are well maintained and it was very easy to find our perfect spot.

: We recently celebrated my daughter's wedding at Rustic Timbers in Viola, KS, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. From start to finish, the team went above and beyond to ensure their day was perfect. They took care of so much on the day of the event, alleviating any stress we might have had. They even took care of cutting up our fruit for us and setting up our popcorn bar and fruit table!! The venue had so many options to choose from so it made it so much easier on us. We got the DJ through them and she kept the dance floor lively all night long, a Photo Booth which was a huge hit with our guests, creating wonderful memories and keepsakes. And we also got a cloud machine and bubble machine. Having these options was so amazing! They also provided the linens, had them steamed and on the tables for us and they have so many decorations to use that we didn't need to buy very much at all! One of the highlights was the cake and cupcakes, which were not only beautiful but absolutely delicious! Our guests couldn't stop raving about them! We will be using her for all our cakes from here on out!! Overall, Rustic Timbers exceeded our expectations in every way. Their dedication to making the day special was evident in every aspect, and we are so grateful for their outstanding service. If you are looking for a venue that will take care of everything and more, Rustic Timbers is the place to go! Thank you for making their wedding day unforgettable! -

Brightwater Bay is such a beautiful venue! The staff is very nice and helpful and will answer any questions you have. It’s the perfect venue for a wedding, meeting, or just to hang out at! My husband and I got so many compliments on our wedding day of how amazing everything was! I would definitely recommend hosting your next event at Brightwater!

The Highlands was the perfect all inclusive venue for our December 2024 wedding! With a bridal and groom suit, four bathrooms, two bar areas, a private drive/entrance to the kitchen for the caterers, a decoration closet we had full access to and a great wedding coordinator and team! We met three times prior to our day and planned seating and decoration ideas with them. They were wonderful making sure we could have a relaxed day while they took care of set up and tear down! We had our rehearsal dinner the day prior at the venue included in our package. We didn't have close to their max seating (500) but they made it look like the places was filled! Very pleased and thankful for their help and great communication day of making sure the ceremony went smoothly and keeping guests inside until ready for the ceremony.
