We are a couple from Montréal , Canada and we had our dream wedding in beautiful Chianti in August. Our wedding planner recommended Le Cirque for our food. We met with Cristina from Le Cirque on a quick visit to Italy to visit our venue and meet with suppliers with our wedding planner. Cristina set up our tasting for the menu that we had chossen . She made recommendations and we were able to customize certain courses. The good thing is that you will not need to deal with other vendors for table setting , chairs etc. They have all those items and you can customize your table setting. The Day of the wedding the food was excellent the staff was so great and professionnal and Cristina was present t to make sure everything went to plan. I would highly recommend their services especially if you are planning a over sea wedding or event

Where to begin!! Gianni, Sara and their team are perfect! You are going to regret if you do not book with them. They did pizza and gelato for a wedding welcome party I hosted for a friend. Gianni and Sara were very responsive during the planning and even took the time to have phone calls with me. I ask a lot of questions and messaged them a lot and they were very informative and patient. After meeting Gianni at the event he was so so kind. We became friends very quickly. His team created a beautiful set up and anything and everything we wanted. The pizza and gelato were delicious and they made sure no one when hungry. I am so grateful to have met Gianni and talked with Sara multiple times. They are some of the kindest and best people I’ve had the pleasure of meeting. I would use their services for all of my events if I could. Do not miss the opportunity to work with them. THANK YOU to Gianni Sara and the entire team. Absolutely incredible. :))

We certainly had very clear ideas of what our wedding party should be, I had been collecting fantastic pictures of beautiful floral arrangements for years and I always thought my guests should be thrilled with the great food they could taste, I imagined a big park with lots of stalls and the chefs cooking for us and entertaining us, a bit like a show. My husband and I are part of Gordon Ramsay's staff, I am a pastry chef and Felix the manager of Gordon's various venues in London, and most of our guests would have been star chefs from our team or from star restaurants all over the world....we couldn't get the catering wrong and that was our biggest fear. We live in London and everything had to be managed remotely, we had a year in front of us and we started sending a thousand emails all over Tuscany but none of them convinced us, we are also in the industry and we understood that they simply wanted to sell us their service. We read the reviews and everyone was collecting a lot of them until I found the showcase of Progetto Matrimonio, initially I was struck by the photos of the preparations, beautiful just as I wanted them, then reading the reviews I noticed a common thread, the availability and kindness of Elisa the owner, being able to organise and manage the organisation with her at 360°, which for me was fundamental and of enormous help, but there was always the fear of how we would eat. I read among the various reviews one in particular was apparently negative and I immediately read the owner's response to that couple and there we realised that she would have been the right choice because only an expert in the field like us could answer in such detail, demonstrating the professionalism of the entire staff of Progetto Matrimonio: they had saved and secured a wedding that would have gone adrift had it been managed differently. Elisa offered to meet us in a video call and there our impression was confirmed, time zero we booked the flight to Florence and the following week we were in testing and there all our fears dissolved, it was the right choice, the food was excellent, the presentation flawless, Elisa's professionalism and innate kindness, the chef and sommelier made us fall in love with the dishes and we signed up immediately certain that our guests would have a fantastic experience and so it was on 20 August 2023 Our chef friends complimented us both on the impeccable service and the punctuality with which the dishes were served to the guest, the whole service was excellent and we were certainly not a simple or lowly couple In the aperitif Elisa had recommended a typical Lucchese corner, panigacci cooked in front of us and served hot with cold meats and cheeses from Garfagnana....li recommend them to everyone if you want a surprise effect wow assured Food, service, floral arrangement, coordination and planning TOP
