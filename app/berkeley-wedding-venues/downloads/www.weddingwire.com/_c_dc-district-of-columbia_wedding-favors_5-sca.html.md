I purchased candles from Ms. Johnson for my ceremony and reception. I didn't know what size or fragrance I wanted, but I just had to have candles. Renita worked with me to help me decide the right size, fragrance and color to use. The candles turned my evening wedding into something right out of a catalog. I'll definitely be placing an order for more candles to use at other events!

Jason is actually a choclatier. However, he made my cake and it was the best wedding cake I have ever tasted. We used buttercream frosting and it was so smooth and delicious. It wasn't hard like some wedding cake frostings can be. Each bite literally melted when it hit your tongue and you wouldn't want to swallow it, rather you would savor each bite.

I did my daughter's Baptism and 1st Birthday Party with Assembly Line DC. I wanted something different, classy, elegant, out of the ordinary! I didn't want to miss any type of detail...and Assembly Line did it perfectly for me! They worked with the perfection and oustanding service I was looking for! I was so pleased with the results! The table centerpieces were breathtaking... all the favors personalized with my daughter's name ...The way they combined the 2 celebrations in one was great.... The Birthday Party Theme was Tinkerbell and Assembly Line did an amazing job with all the decoration and favors for the kids!!!! Wings, wands, tiaras! It was unbelieable! Every single detail was amazing, classy, elegant, but and the same time fun and modern... The set-up of all the party was breathtaking! It was more than I excepted! I definetely recommend to use Assembly Line DC to all my friends, and I am sure I will use them again for my next event! I define working with Assembly Line DC in 2 words.... " Stressless and Sophisticated"

I worked with IDO to create our engagement party invitations in October 2008. For this event IDO created the invitations, RSVP cards and did the guests list maintenance. I cant begin to describe how creative, professional and helpful the IDO staff is. I had a couple ideas about what I wanted but didnt really have a clear direction. The IDO staff helped me to articulate my ideas into beautiful, unique and creative engagement party invitations. We received so many compliments on the invitations from our guests. We also used the IDO guests list maintenance service and it was such a time saver and stress reliever. We did not have to hassle with the RSVP process, it was great! We were so pleased with IDOs service on the engagement party invitations that we decided to work with them on our wedding invitations and guest list maintenance for the wedding in April 2009. Absolutely flawless! Once again, they created something using our vision in combination with their skill and creativity. We were very pleased with the finished product and were happy to work with IDO. I highly recommend IDO and will use them again!

This was one of our favorite things to choose for the wedding. We loved this favor for lots of reasons! People will actually use it, and the labels are beautiful. They added to the look of the tables. Since I grew up in Virginia, we were happy to use a company from here. We also love the family who started, own and run the business. Even if you aren't looking for a favor, I recommend trying their chutney!

We were able to get most of our decorations for the table's as well as the mints, nuts, and other odds and ends. We saved sooooo much doing it this way and we had a lot of fun making the tablescapes!
