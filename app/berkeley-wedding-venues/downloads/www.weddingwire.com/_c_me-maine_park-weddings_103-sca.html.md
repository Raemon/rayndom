I can’t even begin to tell you how helpful Julie was in the process of booking our wedding and stay there. The skies were so clear on our wedding day so we were very lucky to have the most gorgeous view of ktàtən (Katahdin). My wife is Penobscot and Passamaquoddy (Wabanaki) and it meant so much to both of us to be able to have our ceremony on such sacred land. The staff were also wonderful throughout the resort. LGBTQ friendly as well.

Sugarloaf was the absolute perfect venue for our wedding! From the intimate rehearsal dinner to the stunning ceremony location and the beautiful reception space, each area offered a different space for us celebrate in. There are so many activities, both on and off the mountain, that kept our guests entertained throughout the entire weekend. I can’t recommend Sugarloaf enough as the perfect venue for a wedding, it truly made our celebration unforgettable!

We held all of our weekend events (rehearsal, rehearsal dinner, post dinner welcome drinks, ceremony and reception) at the venue and it was nothing short of amazing! The Lions Club staff was very responsive and helpful with all the planning and questions before, during and after. And your money goes to a great cause! I cannot recommend this venue enough!

My wife and I got married at Camp Ketcha on May 4th, and the venue exceeded our expectations! We chose the venue for 3 reasons: it had outdoor, covered outdoor and indoor space; we could provide our own alcohol, and we could self cater. We wanted the various space option, because though we really wanted to have the ceremony outdoors, we were getting married in May in New England, so the possible weather ranged from beautiful at 70 to a snow storm. Fortunately, the weather cooperated and we were able to get outdoor photos at the venue and have an outdoor ceremony. We then had the pavilion area for our cocktail hour, and indoors for our reception. The venue permitted us to serve our own alcohol and food (with the appropriate insurance) which allowed us to save a ton of money on catering and bar service, but we also could have had a fully catered wedding if we had wanted. The great hall was an amazing space for the ceremony, with high ceilings, a massive fireplace and a large side room for the food. There was also a kitchen for food storage and prep. The venue also provided and set up the tables and chairs for the indoor space and the chairs for the outdoor ceremony (at an additional fee). The staff there were also amazing to work with and made everything super easy. One of my favorite parts was that the had created a map of the venue with to scale tables so we could print it out and take a picture so they knew exactly where to put everything. Overall, we have nothing but good things to say about Camp Ketcha! We also really liked that our money was going to support a kids camp rather than just into someones pocket.

We got married at BMC on 10/2/21 after postponing during COVID from the year prior. We have had no regrets and couldn't have asked for a better day. Unfortunately it rained so our outdoor ceremony was a no-go but Katie, Steve and Tyler had the perfect plans in place for a back-up indoor option in front of their large fireplace. It truly was better than imagined. Our plated dinner was spectacular and they really helped transform our ideas into the perfect night. The night before we were able to have a pre-wedding party & having guests stay in their 14 water-front cabins was a major bonus! Katie and Tyler were great and easy to work with, making it all a breeze. Would highly recommend.

We had an absolutely wonderful experience at Kingsley Pines, and I can’t recommend it enough! From the moment we started planning, Becky was an incredible support. She was with us every step of the way, providing valuable input during both the pre-planning phase and throughout the weekend of our wedding. Her expertise and willingness to assist made the entire process so much smoother and less stressful. The venue itself is stunningly beautiful, offering a picturesque backdrop for our special day. It is also incredibly flexible, allowing us to personalise every aspect of our wedding to reflect our unique style and preferences. One of the most practical features was the giant walk-in fridge, which was perfect for storing DIY flower arrangements and other essentials, making our preparations much easier. Our guests thoroughly enjoyed the weekend and had everything they needed to enjoy the celebration. We received nothing but positive feedback both during and after the wedding, with many commenting on how beautiful and accommodating the venue was. Overall, our wedding was everything we wished it would be, and we are so grateful to the team for making it all possible.

We (and our guests!) loved staying on site in the cottages at Harborfields during our wedding weekend. Our favorite part of the weekend was being able to stay on site with all our closest friends and family, and really utilize the space for all of our wedding related events -- from a rehearsal dinner pig roast and lawn games, to a 5k(ish) and pancake breakfast the morning of. Boothbay Harbor made for a stunning backdrop, and we were grateful to be able to create a wedding that fit both our vision and budget. Huge thanks to Tim and Wendy for all of their help and flexibility throughout the planning process and especially during the weekend itself. We look forward to coming back for anniversaries in the future!

Lurie was amazing from start to finish. She helped us liaise with the rental company as we had our wedding outdoors in our backyard. She was incredibly knowledgeable about wedding logistics and flow and was always conscious of our bottom line. The week of our wedding she would get back to us within the hour. The food was INCREDIBLE. All our guests raved about the stations and the appetizers!

If your looking for a location to get married that has a quiet ( private ) country setting this is it! The strolling green acres provide lots of room so guests don't feel over-crowed. The new patio with a gas fireplace provides guests with lovely place to have cocktails and catch up with loved ones and may turn into a dance floor later in the evening. The Stone House itself is very beautiful made with mostly coble stones, it will provide an elegant backdrop for any photo opportunities. It's got my vote! Shirley Anderson Manchester, ME
