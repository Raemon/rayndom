Graduation party

I want to thank Oasis Reception for their service. I had a graduation party for my daughter on July 26, 2025 and I used oasis reception for the decor. OMG I was very satisfied with the outcome. Esther was very professional. She communicates with me throughout the process and her price was very reasonable. I couldn’t be any happier with her work. I got a lot of compliments from my friends/ guests during the event and even afterwards. People called me days after the party to ask who did the decor. I advise anyone to use Oasis Reception for their events. I was very very satisfied

Special moments

Esther has been such a blessing to our family. She put her heart into every event she did for us — my birthday, baby shower, our church dinners, and my daughter’s baby prom — and it truly showed. Each moment was filled with beauty, love, and care. She didn’t just plan events, she created memories we will cherish forever. I’m so thankful for her gift and her spirit. Esther, thank you for making our special moments unforgettable.l

I’m not currently getting married, but I’ve been working with Oasis Reception for many years now so I trust when it is time to get married, I know I can count on her to fulfill my wishes. From birthday parties, to anniversaries, she knows exactly how to execute a sensational theme. She can be your in-house decorator for the wedding and all future endeavors. Her work speaks for itself.
