The Murat Shrine is a wedding reception and special events venue located in the historic Cultural District in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana. A temple of Masonic origin, this stunning event space boasts a rich history dating back to 1884 and speaks to the hearts of couples looking for a unique and mystical place to celebrate their nuptials with family and friends.

**Facilities and Capacity**

The Murat Shrine is built in modern Tunisian glamor and features stunningly designed carpets and velvet drapery. An incredibly spacious venue, the Murat Shrine Arabian Room can hold up to 300 wedding guests, with several smaller spaces suited to intimate gatherings.

For large-scale celebrations and receptions, the Murat Shrine offers two lavishly designed event spaces.

The newly renovated Tunisian Room hosts 120 attendees, offering guests an outdoor deck area and a complete bar area with professional LED's for your pictures and video. The Arabian Room boasts a capacity of 300 and is a grand reception area with a stage for ceremonies & teary-eyed wedding speeches. The large hardwood dance floor provides ample space for everyone to get their groove on, and the Arabian has two full bar service areas to ensure everyone is getting served their favorite drinks without a long wait. The Murat Shrine also offers private suites where you and your soon-to-be spouse can happily prepare for the celebration.

**Services Offered**

The Murat Shrine showcases an extensive catalog of top-quality catering and event services provided by Grafton Peek Catering & Food Service. For your peace of mind, high-quality chairs and tables are all provided as part of your room rental. Grafton Peek offers a wide variety of catering styles, giving you and your partner a chance to experience your wedding feast buffet-style or through a plated table service. You have your choice of cash bar or open bar stocked with the finest libations, and our bar team is ready to provide your guests with your favorite signature drinks.

Host your wedding ceremony on the dance floor or the stage in the Arabian Room, or consider a cabaret-style ceremony in either the Tunisian or Arabian.

We can assist with your DJ services, wedding cake, decorations, and other wedding & reception needs, making the Murat a one-stop shop for your wedding day. Our team will help to take the anxiety of much of the planning by providing you with all of your pricing up-front, along with top-notch, professional referrals for outside services.
