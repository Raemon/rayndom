Stephan was the officiant for my wedding on October 18th 2025 and I have to share what an amazing job he did. He was easy to communicate with, attentive and thorough to make sure our ceremony is personal and exactly what we wanted. We received the most compliments on our ceremony because of how perfect it was and actually had people ask for copies of the ceremony because the words he spoke touched so many there. He showed up to rehearsal and made sure we all knew what we were doing and answered any questions that anyone had! 10/10 recommend Stephan for any newly engaged couples looking for their officiant!!!

We were so happy with our decision to book with Pam to officiate our wedding. Pam was super available and insightful throughout the planning, and ultimately made our ceremony so much more intimate and meaningful. We also really loved how happily open and flexible she was with our non-traditional ceremony plans, while helping us work through a lot of the little logistics. We absolutely recommend Pam’s services for any kind of wedding!

My wife and I were so happy working with Down the Aisle Ceremonies as our wedding day coordinators last November. We specifically got to work with Pearce, and he was amazing! He was friendly, organized, and communicated efficiently. Our Day Of would not have been possible without him. He helped us immensely to work through our timeline and details to ensure things went smoothly, especially important as my wife and I had our baby 3 months before the wedding. The whole wedding day went without incident - Pearce directed the vendors, kept us all on schedule, and frequently checked in with us to make sure we had everything we could want. I wouldn’t hesitate to work with them again in the future!

Denise Tucker's ability to honor my husband’s life with such authenticity and grace speaks volumes about her gift as a speaker. It’s remarkable how she captured his essence so vividly that guests believed she was family—a testament to her deep empathy and storytelling talent. Her thoughtful balance of spirituality, while respecting my family’s beliefs, created an inclusive space where everyone could connect and mourn meaningfully. Thank you Denise!!

Being an older couple who wanted an intimate ceremony in our home we did not have an officiant. I found Tom on The Knot website. His reviews proved what we had hoped for. Tom is kind & caring & performed a ceremony for us that was exactly what we wanted. The planning process allowed us to choose the type of vows we wanted @ Tom walked us though everything with ease. Even our family members were impressed with him. I highly recommend Tom to perform your wedding regardless of the size of your ceremony. We are so grateful!
