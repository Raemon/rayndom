John played for our guests as they arrived at our ceremony and then played some beautiful, original music during our processional and ceremony. We chose a Beatles tune for our recessional and have had so many great comments from family and friends! John then played during our cocktail hour for our guests - they all just loved it! He enhanced such a wonderful, loving environment with his beautiful guitar music. He definitely is a Guitarist Extraordinaire! Thank you, John!

Petra is a gifted, intuitive musician. This, combined with her incredibly warm presence and professionalism, is what makes her stand out from others. We had a micro wedding of 25 people. It was so important to us that every component fit in with our vision for intimacy. I had a very particular vision for the day. Petra’s music simultaneously elevated our ceremony, while bringing it all together into one cohesive moment in time. Without a doubt, I believe our ceremony felt magical because of Petra. She played at the perfect volume, choosing the appropriate music based on my loose guidance, and also perfectly executed the moments of silence we asked for. I give Petra my strongest recommendation. I chose to communicate/work with her directly (rather than her talent rep), and I’m so glad that I did. Thank you Petra!!!! We will always remember how our wedding day felt thanks to your musical presence.

Everything with Empire Strings was low stress, music was beautiful, and they were very easy to work with. They sent a member to the rehearsal to figure out exactly how they fit into the ceremony, sounded great, and we were able to choose the pieces we wanted for our big day.

We had The Giovanni String Trio perform at our wedding, and they were absolutely superb. They played beautiful classical pieces before the ceremony, Hallelujah and Ave Maria during the ceremony, and contemporary arrangements afterward. The music truly made the event and added so much emotion and elegance to the day. Beyond the performance, they were incredibly easy to work with—professional, prompt, friendly, and clearly outstanding musicians. Everything was seamless from start to finish. Highly recommend The Giovanni String Quartet for any special occasion.

First off to be a member or have family that attends this church to have your wedding there. With that out of the way they are one of the sweetest group of people I have worked with. Both me and my fiance as the time knew what kind of service we wanted to have which was a simple ceremony with out the preacher going on random tantrums..... He officiated the service so sweet and loving! He really lead the service the way we wanted and then gave us a blessing at the end. Pastor Tom was one of the best parts of our wedding day! Also the church is so beautiful it's a blank canvas and the garden out side are so beautiful! The pictures in the garden is my favorite!!

Omar and the Trio Los Amigos of New Mexico were great! A single classical guitarist played pre-ceremony. Then, the performer played two contemporary songs that we asked him to learn for the wedding processional, which sounded beautiful. He even provided the microphone and amplification for our officiant and vows. During the reception, the mariachi trio serenaded the guests. My traditional Hispanic-New Mexican family, my fiance's family, and our out-of-town friends really enjoyed the intimate, authentic presentation of the music. Thanks Omar!

Rene was phenomenal to work with! She not only communicated with me in a timely manner but also helped plan the ceremony! During my rehearsal I was a little lost on the whole thing and she was able to help me get everyone organized and gave perfect direction. She was so amazingly helpful! Also, we had the unfortunate circumstances of our dinner being delayed by 40 minutes! So when I asked Rene to stay extra time during cocktail hour she immediately said “ yes whatever you need I’m here” which I can’t thank her enough for! She was a joy to work with and I can’t say thank you enough! Rene also learned a song we really wanted for our wedding which was beautiful and was beyond prepared with music for cocktail hour. I can say as the crazy Bride she definitely made my life 10000% easier. She is such a joy to work with and I would recommend her for any event! Thank you so much Rene!
