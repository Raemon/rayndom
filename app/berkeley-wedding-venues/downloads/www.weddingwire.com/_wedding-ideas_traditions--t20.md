# Traditions

A wedding ceremony is about more than just “I do” – it’s the rituals and traditions you choose that make each moment extra sentimental. From choosing who will walk you down the aisle to picking just the right ritual to symbolize your union, this is the place to find the perfect traditions for your big day.
