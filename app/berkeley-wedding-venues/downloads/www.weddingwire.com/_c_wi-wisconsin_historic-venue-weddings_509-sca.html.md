Nicole and her team were so responsive and professional with everything leading up to our wedding! Nicole would respond almost instantly most days when we would send her emails with all of our questions. She was super flexible with our request to have BBQ as our meal and even put together a team to help clear tables and wash dishes since our caterer couldn't do that. The Dekoven Center is absolutely worth the price as it made for the most stunning pictures all around the campus and provided plenty of space for both the ceremony and the reception. If you are looking for a timeless wedding venue, you have found it here.

I’ve worked multiple weddings at The Fitzgerald, and it’s incredible! As the owner of Beauty Unveiled by Tia, a premier on-location hair and makeup company, I love this charming 1874 Italianate-style mansion with its opulent ballroom, exquisite parlors, lush garden terrace, and timeless historic elegance that makes every bridal look absolutely shine. Highly recommend!

My husband and I had our reception at House On A Hill and it was a wonderful experience. We have nothing but positive comments. The entire process was organized and efficient, the venue was immaculate, local setting is charming (we love Twin Lakes!), our family and friends were impressed, and what stood out to us the most was the entire staff was communicative, friendly, and went above and beyond to make our night a perfect one-which it was. We highly recommend this venue and we will definitely book it again for our next major event!

We had the most magical weekend at this venue! From the moment we arrived, everything exceeded our expectations. The camp is set in a truly beautiful location — peaceful, scenic, and full of natural charm. Every building on the grounds is so thoughtfully designed and beautifully decorated that it honestly doesn’t need any additional décor; it already feels picture-perfect from start to finish. A huge thank-you to Laura, the camp director, who was absolutely wonderful to work with. She answered our menu many questions. Our group had such an incredible time — the combination of the stunning setting, cozy accommodations, and welcoming atmosphere made it an unforgettable weekend. We can’t recommend this venue highly enough!

Beautiful venue with three levels for use. Main doors and back door make for easy access for loading and unloading decor. Refrigerators behind the bar on site and a freezer for ice. In-house speaker system made ceremony and cocktail hour music easy for our DJ. This quaint venue incorporates the heritage of Stoughton with an updated vibe. Great for all kinds of events

My husband and I had an incredible experience working with the Ludlow Mansion staff to create our dream wedding. Not only is the venue picturesque, they offer so much more than other venues at a reasonable price. They understand the stress couples and families go through to plan the perfect wedding and are there every step of the way to help with the wedding planning process. As experienced professionals in the business, they were extremely helpful to ensure the day of our wedding went smoothly. It was a stress free experience for us as we knew they had everything handled. Not only were the staff great to work with, the venue is beautiful with so many amazing picture opportunities! Greg and Penny take pride in their business and were wonderful people to work with. We highly recommend the Ludlow Mansion!
