Michalis was incredible! Super talented, flexible, and so easy to work with. He created the most magical atmosphere and truly was the MVP of our day. Such a gentleman and absolute professional. Our guests as well as we loved him — highly recommended! We booked the 5-hour DJ + 3-hour live music package, and he nailed both! His live singing was amazing — emotional, magical, and he even performed our favorite songs. As a DJ, he lit up the dancefloor and took tons of guest requests.

Artistic Productions is my favorite wedding service! they help us to do our decorating in the restaurant, also they help us to arrange the wedding details, he did a wonderful job for our pre-wedding pictures. Also, the staff who did our wedding videos also did a wonderful job! The price is fair compared with another wedding company. We were having a memorable wedding and we couldn't thank enough for what you did to us. Thank you and I would love to recommend everyone who's deciding to have a wedding soon!

Louis performed during our reception meal at our wedding in Santorini. From the moment Louis began his set myself, partner and guests were all in awe of his voice. Louis is so passionate about what he does and it shows! Louis offered us the option of choosing songs from a playlist but we opted for Louis to choose himself as we knew he would know best. Each song Louis did choose complimented one another and the playlist set such a magical vibe throughout our meal. We hope to visit Santorini within the future and hope that our paths with Louis will cross once again! Love & best wishes, Kieran & Clare

A singer can make or break your wedding and irwan without doubt made it! He practiced a song on my beloved Celtic at a weeks notice and absolutely smashed it! All songs he played were top class my only regret is that he can’t come to the UK to do our evening reception back home! Big big thank you irwan

I literally have no words that can describe Myrto. She communicated with me for well over a year right up until the day. She supported me with choosing the right songs and created the music depending on the vibe of the guests during her time with us on the day. She attended a pre wedding meeting the day before the wedding which was a lovely surprise to meet her in person, she double checked everything was in place and to finalise everything, She even asked what we would like her to wear . On the day she played beautifully throughout and all the guests commented on her talent, the way she plays is breathtaking. She helped us create our dream come true. I would 100% recommend her, i wish we could do it all again.

Sofia was got in as a surprise for me by my sister . I couldn't have been happier . She literally lit up the evening with her beautiful voice and charisma . She is truly a gifted entertainer . She sang all the requested songs beautifully and made all of us feel so comfortable. She plays the saxophone and flute eloquently . I would surely recommend Sofia to anyone looking for a musician/singer to brighten up any event . Thanks so much !!!!!
