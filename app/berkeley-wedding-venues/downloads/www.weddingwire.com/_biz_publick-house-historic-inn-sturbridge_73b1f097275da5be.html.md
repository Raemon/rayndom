BEST Venue we could have asked for! A total fairy tale wedding!

We got married at Publick House Historic Inn and it was truly the BEST decision we made. From day one, Allison, Jon, Abby, Paige, and the whole team made us feel completely supported — every question was answered, every detail was handled, and they kept us calm through the chaos of wedding planning so we could actually enjoy the day.  
  
Allison was incredible to work with throughout the entire planning process. Her communication was clear, warm, and always timely — she helped us think through the tiniest details, guided us on timing, and made sure we felt confident and stress-free by the time our wedding weekend arrived.  
  
On the big day, Jon Pensinger was our rock. He coordinated vendors, managed the timeline, and somehow kept everything running smoothly without us ever feeling rushed. From the baraat to the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception, everything flowed seamlessly — we never had to worry about what came next because Jon and his team were already on it.  
  
Chef Ken O’Keefe and his team went above and beyond — the food was incredible, beautifully presented, and tailored to fit our Indian wedding. Our guests are still raving about the dinner and desserts! The venue itself is so charming and historic, but somehow also felt like it was made for us — the perfect setting for our colorful ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. We’ll never forget how cared for we felt and how flawlessly everything came together.

Kelly Wedding 10/05/2024- Paige Hall

Had an amazing day for the best day of my life. Was given a room that you can use to get ready in for the bride, and our suite for our over night stay. The property was decorated so nicely for the fall time, so our pictures came out amazing with all the fall colors. The staff was amazing from start to finish, from planning to the wait staff and our coordinator. They set up everything exactly how I imagined it and couldn't have been happier. Our guests were also happy about all the food also.

Best and Most Stress Free Wedding!

We had the best wedding at the Publick House! We didn't want to plan much, and Diana and the team there made everything so easy and stress-free! On the day of, Dennis and Savannah were amazing, making sure we could just enjoy our day with no worries! All of our guests had a great time - from the food, to the service, to being able to walk back to their rooms after open bar! They even recommended a DJ that we loved. The price and value was excellent, and I wouldn't change a thing!

The Best Wedding Ever!

When I say book this venue DO IT! My husband and I always knew we would get married here but didn’t realize how truly amazing they are. Allison is absolutely fantastic, she is caring, friendly and tells you exactly how things will go. We had no idea they would actually help you with everything!!!  
Danielle and Savannah were also amazing. To the point were they bustled my dress. After a day of stress they quite literally made our day. My husband and I chose to relax during our cocktail hour and they brought us our appetizers the whole time. The best venue ever

Magical Wedding Day! 

My husband and I knew we wanted the Publick House to be our wedding venue from the minute we saw it at our first tour! The grounds are beautiful, the wedding packages are affordable and inclusive, and we loved the idea of all of our family and friends being able to stay on site with us for our entire wedding weekend. We were married in June 2023 at the gazebo and had our reception under the tent. Our primary contact/coordinator, Allison, went above and beyond to make sure all of our questions and concerns were handled in the months leading up to our wedding. The weather on the day of our wedding went back and forth from raining to sunny and the staff was amazing about being flexible and keeping us updated on alternate plans for our outdoor ceremony. In the end, the weather cooperated and we had a beautiful outdoor ceremony! I would choose Publick House as our wedding venue again in a heartbeat! We loved it SO much and had the most magical wedding day.

Best night of our lives

Publick house is located in a beautiful place with gorgeous buildings and decorations. Outside landscaping was also lovely. The staff were super responsive, helpful, nice, and flexible. All our guests noticed the professionalism of the staff. The food and service was great too. Even the chef came over to us and asked if we enjoyed the food. We got the open bar and the service was perfect. They were so supportive that we had no stress. They pointed out all the details that we never thought about. We brought the material for centerpieces and gave them a photo of our design, and they did it better than we thought. They also collected the decorations for us after the event and stored it for us. They had an awesome on site bakery as well. The cake was amazing and nicely decorated.  
They gave discount codes for the guests with complimentary items from the bakery.  
  
We all had a memorable night! I highly recomend publick house for a perfect wedding or any other event.

The Publick House Inn created magical setting!

The Publick House Inn truly helped create a magical day for our wedding! We had a relatively short engagement and our main contact, Cathy, did a great job working with us on finding a date that worked and getting all of our arrangements settled at a price point that could not be beat by other venues. The reception Chef Miguel and Pastry Chefs were very flexible with our tasting and dietary needs, while Jon our Banquet manager was a great support in organizing our very personalized ceremony. Paige and Kaylee were our supports on the day of and they were simply excellent; anticipating every need and making sure everything was beautiful and went smoothly, all with smiles on their faces! Our guests raved about the venue, including the food, personal touches and service. We are so very grateful that we chose this venue- we would do it all over again!

Dream Wedding

February 2023 Bride. Charming, warm, great food, friendly and quick service, attention to detail, professional. I can't say enough good things about this venue. They know what they're doing and I'm so glad we decided to host our wedding here. I didn't want to have to setup anything the day of the wedding. They not only set everything up but also took everything down. We picked up our decorations up the day after at checkout. Also surprisingly affordable for what you get. Incredible experience, definitely worth a look ☺️

Gorgeous, affordable venue

We had our wedding there 10/31/21! Cannot recommend this place enough as a perfect wedding venue! It's not only gorgeous, it's affordable, the food is absolutely delicious so is the wedding cake, and the staff goes above and beyond the entire weekend! Our wedding was magical in no small part due to how attentive Publick House is. We didn't have to stress about anything the whole weekend, they took care of everything! They even ordered orange soda for my husband's "signature drink", he was so happy! If you're on the fence about having your wedding here, DO IT! You won't regret it.
