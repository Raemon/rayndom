Hiring Sharper Image was some of the best money that we spent on our wedding. Celeste was great to work with and was always very responsive to emails and questions. She went above and beyond to make sure everything was in order. I loved that they did all of the set up and tear down, it took a lot of the stress off of me and my family on the big day! The decorations were beautiful and better than I had imagined. All of the sharper image staff were so nice and easy to work with. Highly recommend!!!!

Carrie and her team did the unthinkable. She was able to pull off every thought that I had and turn it into a reality. Her thought to detail, organization, and originality is what pulled my wedding together. I would recommend Carrie and her team to anyone who is looking for an event decorator!

Our son/his finance planned their wedding in October 2019 in Jamestown, ND, which turned out to have the blizzard of the century! Brittany went the extra mile to even get to our event, through snow, ice and wind and very poor roads. Even though we didn't know if many people could come to our event, she went ahead and decorated the banquet hall as beautiful as it could be! The decorations for their Bridal Table were fun, memorable, and fit with the couple's vision. We couldn't have been happier with Brittany and her team.
