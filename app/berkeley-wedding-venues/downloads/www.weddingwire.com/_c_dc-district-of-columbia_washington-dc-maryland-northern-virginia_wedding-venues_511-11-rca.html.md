Great venue for our reception (Wedding was a full Mass). We snuck it in just before all the fall color was gone. The staff were excellent and very helpful and the food was wonderful. Peanut is a great bartender and kept everyone happy. One note to consider. Ours was a smallesh reception (around 50 guests) and there is a minimum charge on the food side so be sure to take that into consideration and upscale your alcohol (spirits and wine) as well as food if that is an option. Overall we had a fantastic reception and would recommend The Artium to any couple looking for an intimate setting. There are several open houses held there so be sure to attend one.

We got married in the fall of 2024 at the Omni Shoreham and it truly was a beautiful venue. We selected the Omni because of the outdoor spaces, the ease of having food & beverage through the same people as the venue, and our love of the back garden for the ceremony. We chose the blue room for our reception, which was a great space and felt separate from the rest of the hotel. Omni does all the catering and bar services in house which made things simple for us -- the food was amazing (we still have guests tell us how good it was)! Omni will try to upsell you parts of their package so definitely keep an eye on what items are in the base package and what upgrades will cost. With that in mind though, all of the Omni staff, chef included, will work with you on figuring things out that might not be technically in their offerings -- just ask and they will help figure something out! The only hiccup we had is that Omni's in house event coordinator ended up leaving part of the way through our wedding planning process. It was a bit difficult to get a new point of contact from Omni and even through our wedding they had not hired a full time replacement. Because of this there was a little chaos in the planning and coordination but overall I would highly recommend Omni as a venue!

UMD Memorial Chapel was the perfect venue to host our wedding, from the picturesque chapel and outside view we were hooked from the get-go. They were flexible with us for the logistics meeting (both of us out of state) and our meeting was in person 4 days before the wedding. During the meeting they offered reserved signs with names of family on it which was great edition. Ms. Denise, Jhanvi and Harshi were of immense help. We showed up late to our rehearsal (8PM) and worked with our wedding coordinator to help with the event. They even allowed us to run a little late for practicing. They honed in on our specific songs and timings. The day itself went flawlessly, and we were able to get our couple shots outside the venue. I was able to request a last second song to play during the service itself and they had it covered. I provide this level of detail to give an idea of how helpful this crew is, and they truly strive to make the day itself stress-free. I did purchase extra time before our 1.5 hr block to have time to take photos at the venue before the wedding, which I would recommend if you need (1 hour service, 200 people). 10/10 service from these guys and not given lightly. Thank you UMD Memorial Chapel! https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRXje88jni3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

"Fantastic wedding".! "Wonderful buffet dinner"! "An amazing cocktail hour"! These were just some of the accolades we got for hosting our daughter's wedding at the Marriott at Fair Oaks. From the beginning planning stages to the rehearsal evening and the wedding itself; dealing with our event coordinator, Lucy Warner, was a totally professional experience. It was a smoothly ran event! I had told my daughter to expect hiccups somewhere along the way, but there were none! Ms. Warner orchestrated the wedding flawlessly! In the months leading up to our event, she was always easy to reach out to and our questions were answered promptly. The entire Marriott staff were a delight to work with. The bartender and servers who worked that evening were professional, polite and were always there willing to help in anyway we needed! The food was absolutely delicious! We met our event coordinator and the chef a few months prior to our wedding for a delightful evening of taste testing. The chef explained every dish we were tasting in great detail. It was hard to eliminate one from each category! Our taste testing evening was topped off with a plate of mouth watering cookies for dessert. It took me only a second to decide to order several dozen of these wonderful in-house baked cookies and brownies for our wedding. What a hit they were!! Those cookies/brownies flew off the plate! A week after the wedding and I'm still hearing so many rave reviews that this was the best wedding ever. Honestly, I owe this wonderful evening for our daughter and new son-in-law to Lucy Warner and her team at Marriott! Thank you all so much! Ms. Warner and her staff at Marriott, truly exceeded our expectations! I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced venue in Northern VA to please check out the Marriott at Fair Oaks! You will not be disappointed!

##  Plan the Perfect Washington DC wedding 

The US capitol is known for many things, but a gorgeous wedding may not necessarily be at the top of the list. If you're hosting a wedding in the DC area, there are a ton of great things you can do, and we're here to guide you in the wedding planning process. Washington DC, also known as the District, is steeped in history while still maintaining it's modern metropolitan feel. At roughly 69 square miles, DC is quite small as far as cities go. But don't let size fool you, Washington, DC is full of wedding reception venues and wedding locations that will make your wedding a stunning success. 

##  Popular Washington DC Wedding Venues & Prices 

The first part of the wedding process is to decide on a date and wedding venue. Popular wedding locations to have your wedding ceremony and reception in Washington DC include: mansions, restaurants, hotels, and historic venues. If you're looking for something outside of the box, museums are a fun and unique wedding venue for your Washington DC wedding ceremony. If you want an outdoor wedding location, set up in one of many parks or along the Potomac river. Just make sure to check if you need any special permission for a lush outdoor wedding. As for costs, here are a few things to consider. The average price for a wedding in DC is around $35,000, about $6,000 above the national average of $29,000. 

##  Travel and Accommodations 

To surrounding Marylanders and Virginians, DC is known for it's dense traffic, so when traveling into the city it's best to give yourself extra travel time. If you or your guests are flying into the area, Washington DC has two major airports. Ronald Reagan National Airport, available for flights to the US and its territories, is only about a 15 minute car ride or half hour metro ride to wedding venues located around the center of the city. The travel time depends entirely on your wedding location. The second is Washington Dulles International airport. Dulles will be a bit further from wedding venues in the center of the city, but has international flight options. The drive from Dulles to DC is about 45 minutes. A metro ride would be about an hour and ten minutes. If guests are driving to Washington DC wedding locations, highways connect in the city from every direction. Route 495, also known as the Capital Beltway, loops around the outside boundaries of DC as well as continuing into the city and can be accessed from any direction. Route 66 from the west is another option when driving into the District. 

For hotel accommodations, the average price for a night in Washington DC is about $148. If you are looking to host a large number of guests in the same hotel, we suggest checking out this fabulous [hotel block service](https://hotelblocks.weddingwire.com "Hotel Block Service"). It will help you get the best rate for rooms near your wedding venue. 

##  Weather Considerations 

Whether you're planning to get married at an indoor or outdoor wedding venue, weather can impact your special day. Here are a few things you should know about the weather when planning a Washington, DC wedding. DC is known for hot and humid summers, pleasant springs and autumns, and cold winters with occasional snow. 

The safest time to host a DC wedding, weatherwise, would be in the spring or fall. Preferably between March and June or late August to November. 

The warm season, with hot and humid conditions, tends to last from the end of May to the middle of September.These days, on average, will have a temperature above 79 degrees. The hottest days of the year are expected around the middle of July. Summers in the District are also known for scattered thunderstorms, but those can often be waited out. Weather conditions in the area can change within minutes. If you decide on an outdoor wedding venue in Washington DC, make sure you have a tented area for guests to escape the heat as well as a backup wedding location if there is inclement weather. 

The cold season lasts from the beginning of December to the beginning of March. The average temperatures on these days will likely be between 50 and 29 degrees. The coldest days can be expected around the middle of January, which is also the time it is most likely to snow. However, snow can fall between the end of December and the end of March.If you are planning a winter wedding in Washington DC, an indoor wedding venue is a must but that doesn't mean you do wedding portraits outdoors; just make sure you and your wedding party have appropriate clothes to brave the cold.
