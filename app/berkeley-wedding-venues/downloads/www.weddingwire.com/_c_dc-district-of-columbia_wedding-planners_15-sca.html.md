5.0 out of 5 rating 

5.0 

I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating with EYS (Eventfully Yours, Shawn LLC) on multiple events, and Shawn is truly a pleasure to work with. She is consistently professional, organized, and punctual, which makes event days run smoothly from start to finish. Her communication is clear and proactive, and she maintains a calm, confident presence that keeps both vendors and clients at ease. Her team is equally impressive — always professional, friendly, smiling, and willing to help wherever needed, often going above and beyond their assigned roles. As a fellow vendor, I genuinely value working alongside Shawn and would confidently recommend EYS to any couple looking for a dependable, polished, and experienced event planner.

Michele was absolutely AMAZING. I got in touch with her quite a few months before our wedding. Whenever I had a logistics question during the final months of planning, she was quick to respond and always had the answer. When it got to the actual month and weeks before the wedding, she was beyond amazing. The week of the wedding, she met with my mom, fiance, and me to go over final details and to finalize an incredibly detailed day-of schedule. She contacted all of the vendors to make sure that everyone was on the same page and that they knew the schedule. I didn't realize how much work that would be until I saw everything that she was doing. She was also a wonderful presence at the rehearsal, keeping us all on track and making sure that the wedding party knew what they were doing the next day. Michele goes above and beyond. She is sweet and firm when talking to vendors. It was really helpful to know that I had someone who was going to make sure that everything went the way we wanted it to. I will absolutely be recommending her to everyone that I know who is getting married anywhere in the region. hiring her was one of the best decisions that we made for our wedding. She let me enjoy the final days of preparation and enjoy being a bride, instead of going crazy with all of the details. I can't thank her enough.

Hiring Kim Newton was the BEST decision we made during the wedding planning process. From our first introductory call to the wedding day itself, Kim was always so kind, communicative, and professional. Our wedding day couldn't have been more perfect, and it surely wouldn't have been possible without Kim's creativity, organization, and experience. We were able to put our complete trust in Kim and she sure delivered! She works with the best vendors who were able to exceed all of our expectations. Kim was also always available when needed, and on our wedding day, we didn't have to worry about a thing. We could go on and on about how much we enjoyed working with Kim Newton, and you can't go wrong with hiring her to plan your wedding!

I had the pleasure of meeting with Tomi early in my search process for a planner. She went above and beyond with her research and knowledge on vendors. Her insights helped us figure out what we needed and I highly recommend her for her thoroughness and effort to make sure we had all the details to make strong decisions.

We hired TEGI as month-of coordinators, and we are SO glad we did. We went into the wedding planning process thinking we could handle it ourselves...but having Tanya and her team to support us in the final stretch was worth every penny. They dutifully tracked down vendors' paperwork to submit to the venue, coordinated the final timeline, made sure everyone was where they needed to be at the right times, and had so many helpful suggestions and feedback on everything from the best placement of the gift table to what kind of escort cards would make the most sense for our outdoor venue throughout that entire final month. We had a Persian/American blended wedding, so they had the extra challenge of having to set up a sofreh which they'd never even heard of! But they nailed it (with a little help) and everything looked great, and they loaded all of our stuff (TWO cars worth) into our cars themselves at the end of the night so we could focus on our guests. They attended our venue walkthrough and any other final meetings as well as our rehearsal the day before, and really just made us feel like we could "let go" and actually enjoy our wedding on the day. The peace of mind was honestly priceless.

It’s hard to put into words how excellent LynnAaron Ford with Nouvelle Weddings is—because she just really is that excellent. We experienced the wedding of our dreams in October 2025, and can say with 100% certainty that it would not have been even close to possible without her. LynnAaron provided true full-service wedding planning. We often commented on how it felt like a concierge service—she is so good that it seemed like ours was the only wedding she was planning, although we knew logically that that wasn’t true. She is extremely organized and on top of EVERYTHING! From vendor selection and further communication, to our own personal to-do lists, to creating a website, to designing the wedding, she truly does it all. She honestly took all the stress out of the planning process, for which we are extremely thankful. Neither of us are people who have thought about our wedding since childhood—in fact, we didn’t really start thinking about what we truly wanted until our first meeting with LynnAaron. She was able to help guide us in the right direction when it came to a number of important decisions regarding design, guest list, priorities, etc. While she is an amazing wedding planner, she is also equally (or even more!) amazing on the day itself! On our wedding day, LynnAaron managed her team like a true professional and kept everything running on time and smoothly. Despite having numerous tasks to oversee, delegate, and accomplish, she somehow managed to be ever-present for us as the couple, making sure we were doing okay, were fed, and always had a drink in our hand, to name a few. If you’re looking for a wedding planner who will truly bring your vision to life (or help you create a vision if you don’t have one!), then you absolutely cannot go wrong with hiring LynnAaron. It’s so clear that she loves what she does, and we think that that love is reflected in the weddings that she plans so thoughtfully. Our only regret is that we couldn’t attend our own wedding as guests! Z + M

We cannot recommend Impact Collective enough! Planning a multi-day desi wedding is no small feat, but Kadzo, along with Eddie, Niassa, and the Impact Collective team, made the entire experience not only manageable, but genuinely enjoyable. From the moment we started planning a little over a year ago, Kadzo was with us every step of the way, and we truly could not have done this without her guidance and direction. During wedding planning, Kadzo consistently checked in with us, visited venues and vendors alongside us, and made sure nothing slipped through the cracks. She skillfully balanced our parents’ visions alongside ours while staying true to what we envisioned for our wedding day. One of the things we appreciated most was her ability to help us stay close to our budget without ever making us feel like we were compromising our vision. She always came prepared with thoughtful options and practical solutions, and she truly advocated for us throughout the entire process. We can't say enough about her! Eddie, the owner of Impact Collective, is also amazing! His leadership, experience, and passion are evident in the way the entire team operates. Together, Kadzo and Eddie made us feel supported, heard, and confident from start to finish. Their professionalism and warmth made all the difference. On the wedding days themselves, everything ran seamlessly from our perspective. If there were any hiccups, we didn't notice them! Knowing Kadzo and the Impact Collective team were in charge gave us complete peace of mind. It allowed us to fully be present and enjoy every moment with our family and friends. If you’re planning a wedding, especially a multi-day or culturally rich celebration, we cannot recommend Kadzo, Eddie, and their team enough. We had the best wedding ever and we are so grateful for everything they did to make our wedding unforgettable.

Whether it’s a wedding outdoors and indoors, whether you want white flowers or pink flowers, Jackie makes it happen. She kept us updated and was so quick on getting things done. When we asked her to get something she had it done within days. I felt so confident and was less nervous about wedding planning with her. I truly had the most perfect day because of her and her staff. They are professional and straightforward. Trust her in the process. She doesn’t sugar coat to please, she gives her honest advice using her expertise and experience as a wedding planner. When I wanted to do something or wanted something for the wedding, she made sure she gave her two cents so that I could make a better decision for the wedding and it turned out to be flawless. I couldn’t recommend her services more to someone looking for a planner. Truly went above and beyond. 100/10!

After being engaged for two years my fiancé and I were about to elope when we were told to reach out to Victoria. I had contacted a planner before her who yelled at me for being so behind on planning and assured me we would never be able to hire vendors in time. Then! We met Victoria, we prepared her by telling her how clueless we felt about wedding planning and she sat us down and talked us through the process in a way we were scared to admit we needed. She has relationships with amazing vendors and everyone she recommended was SO lovely to work with. We somehow managed to not only plan a wedding, but in the end it was the wedding day of my dreams and we had so much fun planning it. The day was completely stress free because she considered every detail (and there are a lot)! Plus you know you have a good planner when the guests are raving about her before, during and after the wedding. Cannot recommend Victoria enough, and I definitely encourage getting her full package it is so worth it, plus it’s fun to have her there throughout the process because she’s so fun to hang out with!
