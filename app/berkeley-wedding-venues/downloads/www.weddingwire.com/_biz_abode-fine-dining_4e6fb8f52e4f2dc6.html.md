The best dinner ever

If you were looking for the next best thing in culinary look no further. Abode fine dining is the best to do it. From menu structure, service, professionalism and on the fly changes no one does it like Abode Fine Dining. The hardest part of planning and coordinating a large or small event is always the food. Chef Mike and Chef Marcus made it as easy as possible for me and my family. From writing multiple menu options with every allergy restriction to just personal preference they come prepared. Mike reached out within an hour after receiving my email to go over a couple of specifics and to secure my date. Their food and service could not be more impressive. From the way we were treated to the actual food and service experience we were blown away. They made our whole evening with them perfect. We will definitely be calling back!

Exceptional all around!

Abode Fine Dining was incredible from start to finish. The food was beyond delicious every dish looked beautiful and tasted even better. You could tell everything was made with care and attention to detail. Our guests couldn't stop talking about how good it was! The team was just as impressive. They were friendly, professional, and made the whole experience completely stress-free. Everything ran so smoothly, and they handled all the little details I didn't even think about.  
If you're looking for a catering company that makes your event feel special and effortless, Abode Fine Dining is the one. I'd hire them again in a heartbeat.
