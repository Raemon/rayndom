## About this vendor

![Taren](https://cdn0.weddingwire.com/vendor/138611/original/960/jpg/uo_116831_229499fb-06b3-42b5-90cd-f8e92e1ef178.jpeg?r=1754082857)

#####  Taren 

Owner - Lead Planner 

__Woman-owned

__19 years in business

__We speak English

__Small team (2-10 members)

With over **30 years in the event industry** and **18 years running Diamond Receptions** , I’ve had the joy of guiding countless couples through one of the most exciting — and sometimes overwhelming — times of their lives. My passion is helping couples bring their wedding vision to life in a way that feels thoughtful, cohesive, and uniquely theirs.

I work best with couples who value **guidance and expertise** , and who want a planner they can trust every step of the way. Many of my clients come to me with ideas, colors, or a vision in mind, but aren’t sure how to make it all come together — that’s where I step in. I love helping couples feel confident in their decisions, knowing they have an experienced professional protecting their investment and ensuring every detail is thoughtfully considered.

Because of my design-driven approach, I specialize in weddings that tell a story — from the overall theme down to the smallest details. I guide couples through the planning process with clarity and care, creating weddings that feel intentional, elegant, and unforgettable.

If your goal is a wedding that is pulled together beautifully and thoughtfully, and you want a planner you can trust to lead with experience and heart, we may be a perfect match.

She deserves every star in the sky!

Where do I even start? I'm still in awe of how Taren made my wedding dreams come to life. Working with her over the past three years was an absolute pleasure - through all the ups and downs of changing locations and dates, she was always by our side, guiding us with care and expertise. From the moment we started planning to the smallest details on the big day, Taren was there, holding our hand and making sure everything was perfect. Giving her creative freedom was the best decision I ever made. My wedding day was pure magic, seamless and stress-free, thanks to her and her incredible team. They treated us like family, anticipating our needs and exceeding our expectations. I know, without a doubt, that choosing Taren was the key to making my day truly unforgettable. I felt like royalty, and what she did for us is truly priceless. Five stars can't even begin to capture how amazing she is - she deserves every star in the sky and more.

Giving her creative freedom was the best decision I ever made. My wedding day was pure magic, seamless and stress-free, thanks to her and her incredible team. They treated us like family, anticipating our needs and exceeding our expectations. I know, without a doubt, that choosing Taren was the key to making my day truly unforgettable. I felt like royalty, and what she did for us is truly priceless. Five stars can't even begin to capture how amazing she is - she deserves every star in the sky and more.

Diamond Receptions 

We absolutely loved working with Taren and can’t imagine our wedding without her. Taren brought so much joy, creativity, and calm to the entire process and truly made our dream day come to life. Every detail felt personal and thoughtful, and we were able to fully enjoy every moment! We’re still hearing from friends and family about the overall amazing day and experience we all had. Taren is truly the best!

Thank you Taren and Stephanie! 

I cannot express enough how incredible our experience was with Diamond Receptions for our wedding. From the very first meeting with Taren, to the big day itself, Taren and Stephanie went above and beyond to ensure everything was perfect. Taren was an absolute delight to work with. She was incredibly organized, attentive, and always available to answer any questions we had. Her attention to detail was impeccable, and she truly made us feel like our wedding was the most important event she was working on. Taren's expertise and calm demeanor helped alleviate any stress we had, allowing us to enjoy the planning process. Stephanie was equally amazing. She had such a warm and welcoming personality, making us feel at ease from the moment we met her. On our wedding day, both Taren and Stephanie were on top of everything. They coordinated with our vendors, and managed the timeline flawlessly. Thanks to their hard work and dedication, we were able to fully immerse ourselves in the joy of the day without any worries. We are forever grateful for their exceptional service and highly recommend them to anyone looking for a top-notch wedding coordination team. Thank you, Taren and Stephanie, for making our dream wedding a reality!

Taren really surprised me with her quality of service for being brought in such a short time.

My wife and I hired Taren to help organize and coordinate our wedding as a month-of coordinator. We originally were trying to handle it all personally and I cannot be more happy for the decision to hire Taren. She was able to work with us on our budget, and every call and meeting she was so on-top of things! During our wedding I also have to offer big props for all the work and effort wrangling our families and keeping everything running smoothly and on time. Thank you again for all the hard-work and support on our Wedding day, you helped so much helping us to just enjoy our day rather than be worried about all the details!

Best way to do a wedding!

When I first contacted Taren, my husband and I had been engaged for nearly a year with absolutely nothing decided except our colors. It wasn't that we couldn't agree on anything, it was that we both didn't want to make decisions when we weren't the professionals. Taren said that she could do everything (within reason) and that we wouldn't have to worry about anything. I immediately booked her.  
  
Over the next few months, she short listed venues based off our interests and needs and we settled on the Highland Manor in Apopka. While it didn't have our favorite ballroom (another choice Taren gave us), it had the prettiest spot for ceremony, several rooms for us to get ready in, multiple bathrooms, multiple bars, and everything we could want for our guests (a hotel next door, peacocks on property, and a suitable place for ceremony if it rained). She even took us to Dubsdread to try out the food so we could make our decision.  
  
She then spent a few months researching our theme. When Ren Faire season started up again, she came with us to a few to gauge her understanding of our theme and find little things that would fit in the decor. It was at one of these that she shared that she had been in talks to do something so over the top and wonderful, but because of cost and wanting what was best for the wildlife on property, decided against it. It was at this moment that we knew that our wedding was going to be perfect. Anyone who spends time with us will quickly find out that while we love a spectacle, we want everyone involved to be happy, including the animals that may be a part of that show. Taren got us!  
  
After we had the big ticket items bought and booked, she sat down with us and explained her vision in pictures. We said yes and let her do her thing. She took care of contracts, payments, our invitations and tracking, all the decisions, everything. She asked for a bit of money to do a few surprises for us, and we agreed.  
  
At rehearsal, she told the entire bridal party what to expect and what they needed to do to make sure the day went off without a hitch. She had us rehearse twice, told us where to go in the morning, and sent us off.  
  
The day of the wedding, I walked into a getting ready room that looked like something straight off of pinterest: a long dining table set and decorated was in the middle, ready for lunch, we had four stations for hair and makeup, one with a plush faux fur rug for comfort, an entire tea, coffee, and mimosa station, etc. When I saw it, I started crying. I don't see myself as someone who knows how to prioritizes the esthetic (hence our need for a full service planner), and to know that my bridal party and moms would be in such a beautiful room and that they would be happy and cared for gave me such joy!  
  
After we had hair and makeup done, Taren and our photographer and videographer whisked us to the venue next door. Taren made sure we didn't see anything and spoil the surprise. When it was time for ceremony, she set us up for procession and went off to make sure the guys knew what they were doing (they went in a different way). Our first surprise was that my husband walked in to bagpipes! It perfectly pulled our theme together (he was in a kilt) and I had tears before even starting my walk.  
  
When it was my turn, I walked outside to a completely transformed wonderland. She brought in potted ferns and trees as decor! Perfectly sustainable, gorgeous greenery with lights twinkling our wedding colors. Let me tell you, I was crying so hard I was so happy. It was breathtakingly beautiful. But let me tell you, when we did photos, she and her team used all of that greenery from the ceremony in reception so that nothing was wasted. And our reception looked like a forest at night (she faked moonlight with LEDs, put trees on tables, used candlelight lighting, and made our sweetheart table look like a throne! See the before and after photos)! I cannot stress enough how beautiful everything was, how flawlessly everything seemed to run that day, and how happy we were to have hired Taren! Thank you!

Renaissance Wedding

Taren and her team of vendors made sure that my son and new “daughter” had the wedding that they envisioned! Taren’s ability to turn your thoughts into reality is a true gift! I would highly recommend Diamond Receptions!

Amazing must hire

If you need a wedding or event coordinator you need to go with Taren! Taren and her staff were absolutely amazing (shoutout to Ashley and Stephanie)! They truly made our wedding day a breeze from taking care of guest and setting up our event space- they exceeded all expectations. Taren and her team come prepared for anything including wedding dress mishaps! Taren also comes with so many connections to ensure you get what you are looking for when envisioning your special day. Looking back on this day will forever be special because of the hard work and attention to detail that Taren and her team provided us during our wedding!

Amazing experience

I recently hired Taren as my wedding planner for my wedding, and I am so glad that I did! She was absolutely amazing! She was so organized, professional, and provided excellent customer service. She was always available to answer any questions I had, and she made the entire process of planning my wedding a breeze. She worked with my budget and provided great suggestions for vendors, venues, and other services. My wedding day was perfect thanks to her, and I highly recommend her services to anyone looking for a wedding planner. She deserves a 5-star review!
