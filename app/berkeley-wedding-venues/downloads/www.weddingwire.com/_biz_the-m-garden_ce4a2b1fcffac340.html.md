**Facilities and Capacity**

The M Garden offers a little of everything for your celebrations! Start your big day in the bridal suite with all your best friends and family, and finish with a grand sparkling exit after an evening of memories.

The venue boasts many potential ceremony locations across several acres of outdoor space. From the wooden pergola to the stone bridge, you can make your ceremony as unique as you would like.

Perfection 

My husband and I renewed our vows at M Garden for our 30th anniversary in August 2024 with a large crew of family and friends and if we could give them a 100 star review we would. From my first inquiry to the very last interaction wrapping up our event, Michelle and ALL of her staff were absolutely amazing to us, the venue inside and out was stunning and the catering was classy and more delicious than I had even hoped! We will HIGHLY recommend M Garden to anyone we know. Go tour this place!!!

Wedding Venue

We highly recommend the M Garden if you're looking for a wedding venue. Michelle and her staff were kind, professional, and great to work with! The venue was spotless and they worked with us to have the tables and chairs out so that everything was ready to set up when my wedding coordinator arrived. Michelle quickly responded to all of my questions throughout the entirety of my engagement and was there to support me and my other vendors with anything I needed leading up to the day of. The venue is beautiful and was a perfect fit for what we were looking for! I could not recommend Michelle and the M Garden enough!!

Writing this before the event because we are so pleased with all communication, flexibility, pricing and other arrangements. Michelle and Raymond are extremely helpful. We will use M Garden for wedding ceremony and photos and then go to M Grille fir reception and dinner.

Perfect Venue for Work Event!!

This was our second year of using M Garden to host our work reception. The feedback from everyone that attended loved the event space. The venue is perfect and the space is equipped with everything you could possible need. There are even retractable screens and a built-in sound system that allowed us to easily play our video presentation! The floor plan allows for versatile set-up and flow. Perfect bar area and space for buffet-style catering. The bathrooms were pristine. M Garden is immaculately maintained and the owners are flexible and easy to work with! Plenty of outdoor parking and the outdoor space is breathtaking- for an outdoor wedding or just as the backdrop for your indoor event. There are even fans on the outdoor covered porch overlooking the koi pond- M Garden has though of every special touch to ensure your event is extra comfortable and special! I would recommend this venue for anyone looking for a beautiful venue for their special occasion.
