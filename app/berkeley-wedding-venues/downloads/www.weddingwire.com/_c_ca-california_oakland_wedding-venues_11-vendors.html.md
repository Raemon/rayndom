We couldn't have asked for a more perfect venue than The Terrace Room for our wedding day. From the moment we stepped into the space, we were captivated by its classic elegance, sweeping views of Lake Merritt, and the warm, welcoming atmosphere that made us feel instantly at ease. The historic charm of the art deco architecture paired beautifully with the modern amenities it truly felt timeless and sophisticated. The natural light streaming in through the large windows added a magical touch to our reception, and our guests are still raving about how stunning everything looked! The food was absolutely delicious far beyond typical "wedding food" expectations and the service was top-notch. Every guest felt taken care of, which meant the world to us. If you're looking for a venue that's not only visually breathtaking but also run by a professional and passionate team, look no further than The Terrace Room. It was the perfect place to begin our married life, and we’ll treasure the memories forever.

Angela was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. Her communication was clear, thorough, and timely, and demonstrated a deep knowledge of the venue and wedding planning. She always answered our questions promptly and with professionalism. The Fairview Metropolitan team set up everything smoothly and seamlessly. Chairs and other furniture were moved without guests being bothered. Appetizers and drinks were delicious. Guests commented on how yummy everything was. The space itself is beautiful, spacious, and tranquil, providing a clean and undisturbed setting for our special day. The golfers and airplanes were present but that didn't bother us. We couldn't have asked for a better venue and staff to make our perfect wedding day!

This venue was everything we wanted. We had such a wonderful experience and would recommend it to anyone who loves nature and the beauty of outer space. The staff was so kind and amazing. They were incredibly helpful in making our dream wedding feel uniquely us. Budget-wise, it is pricier than the average venue, but the money felt 100% worth it. Plus, the added bonus of knowing that the money supports a great cause by helping educate curious minds. They do offer several wedding packages to work with and add-ons, which was cool. Something to note, this isn't an all-inclusive venue. You will need to find and hire: lighting, DJ, caterer, etc., but they help by providing a list of recommendations for anything and everything. We were in the Spees building, which our guests loved wandering around, and even enjoyed the interactive activities on display. I could go on forever about this place. This was truly a magical day we will always cherish.

We called 3 1/2 months in advance and already had to choose a time before 8 in the morning or after 1 in the afternoon - so it fills up fast! Biggest room holds 45 people, but it's a beautiful temple with gorgeous views!

Adrianna Castaneda and the staff at Scott's were very helpful and responsive in the entire wedding process. Shanna and I planned our ceremony at Skyline Community Church, but opted to hold our reception at Scott's. Adrianna answered any and all questions and made herself available to meet with us a few times to go over all of the details and double check everything. The reception went so smooth and we could not be happier. All of our guests enjoyed the food, music, venue, and service. If you are looking to hold a special event down the road, then I highly recommend giving Scott's Seafood a call. Shanna and I were very happy and will definitely be using them again to plan a future event. Thank you Scott's and thank you again Adrianna for all of your help!

Preservation Park is truly a hidden gem in the heart of Oakland. With towering palm trees, green grass, and historic Victorian homes, Preservation Park transports you and your guests to a different time and place! In addition to the beauty, Lawrence, the event director, is amazing! Planning a wedding during COVID times is no easy feat and Lawrence was patient, understanding, and accommodating. He championed the wishes of the couple and put their safety, comfort, and experience first! It was very easy to communicate with him throughout the rescheduling process and he was even there to greet us (socially distant and with a mask!) on the day of the elopement. As a planner, I highly recommend having your wedding at Preservation Park!
