##  Wedding Travel Gets You Where You're Going 

Before your big day even arrives, it's important to think about wedding travel. Whether you're planning a destination wedding or your honeymoon. You might need some help with all the details surrounding your travel. 

If you're planning a destination wedding, you'll need to choose where you want to go, how many guests you'll be inviting, and a venue at least 12 months before your wedding. You should also send out invites early (about 2-3 months before the wedding). This will allow guests to RSVP and make plans to travel. 

For your honeymoon, you'll need to decide whether you want to leave for your honeymoon immediately after the ceremony or wait a while to save up some cash. Either way there are plenty of national and international travel options for your honeymoon. On average, couples begin planning their honeymoon about six months before they plan on traveling. This is the time to set a budget, choose dates, research destinations, and find a reputable travel agent (if needed). If you'd like more information on popular honeymoon destinations or where to have your perfect destination wedding, take a look at our fantastic [honeymoon guide](https://publications.weddingwire.com/i/667012-weddingwire-honeymoon-guide?_ga=1.136980407.602318932.1458745489 "Honeymoon Guide"). 

##  Honeymoon Spots and Destination Weddings 

Our guide gives you a look at some great travel destinations based on you and your spouse's style and preferences, with pricey and more budget-friendly ways to experience a destination wedding or see the world as a married couple. 

  * **For your destination wedding** , these are all great options, but here are a few more things to consider when picking a wedding location. 
  * **Pick a location that's easy travel friendly**. Traveling to an unfamiliar area can be hard enough, you don't want guests to get overwhelmed trying to locate their hotel and venue. 
  * **Don't invite everyone a ton of people**. Wedding and travel expenses will grow with every person who comes to your wedding. For some, that's possible, but the ideal guest number for a destination wedding is between 40 and 50. 
  * **Get a wedding planner**. Planning a wedding is hard enough when it's local. If you can't travel to scout venues or negotiate with vendors, a wedding planner familiar with the area can be a huge help! 



If you're a lover of classical history and architecture, think about traveling to Europe. As a smaller continent and a universal currency, it's easier to travel from country to country. Europe has everything from bustling cities to quiet countrysides and fabulous beaches. Check out popular our [European honeymoon destinations](/honeymoons/europe "European Honeymoon Destinations"). 

If you're looking for the perfect island paradise, try Hawaii, the Caribbean, or the South Pacific. The Hawaiian Islands are known around the world for their beautiful tropical landscapes and perfect beaches. The best part is you don't need a passport to get there! Though if you're into a more international island adventure, the Caribbean is a great option for those who like the Atlantic while the South Pacific has all of the gorgeous scenery and oceanscapes fed by the Pacific Ocean. Find the perfect destination on our travel inspiration page for [Hawaii](/honeymoons/hawaii "Hawaii"), the [Caribbean](/honeymoons/caribbean "Caribbean"), and [South Pacific honeymoon destinations](/honeymoons/south-pacific "South Pacific Honeymoon Destinations"). 

If you want to stay a little closer to home, take a look at some great American destinations. Both the eastern and western coastal states have miles of endless beaches, as do the gulf states. National and state parks are a great and cheap way to explore nature and see native wildlife. There's also plenty of history to discover across the country from the colonial era, to the civil war, and westward expansion. Take a look at [popular North America travel destinations](/honeymoons/north-america "Popular North American Travel Destinations") here! 

Mexico is another great option with beautiful resorts in Cabo and Cancun. Whether you just want to lounge in the sand, explore ocean reefs, or learn a bit more about Mexico's eclectic history, there's honestly something from every walk of like. Look at other popular [Mexican honeymoon destinations](/honeymoons/mexico "Mexican Honeymoon Destinations") on the travel inspiration page. 

Once you've picked a travel destination (about five months before you leave), you can begin planning. Around four months before you leave, you should book all of your travel accommodations and find out what documents you need to travel. If you're going abroad, make sure your passport is up to date and that you have all necessary visas and vaccines. Two months before departure, you should be confirming all documents, reservations, and planning & booking activities for your trip. A month before, you should find transportation to and from the airport if needed and any other honeymoon essentials. Then it's just packing your bags and heading off to your great adventure.
