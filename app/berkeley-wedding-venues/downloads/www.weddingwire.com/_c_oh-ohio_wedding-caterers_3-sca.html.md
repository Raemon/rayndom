I had a charcuterie table and mini cheesecakes at my wedding. I was very pleased with the pricing and moved forward with picking my flavors of cheesecake. There were so many options and my guests still talk about them to this day! The way I chose to communicate was through email and some texting as I had also paid for an officiant as well and needed to talk to him about the speech and how things would proceed from there. Everything was seamless and easy, they were extremely helpful and professional!

Delightmore was truly a delight! From the salesperson, Alex Reed, to our event manager Ellie Mariska. All so professional and easy to work with. They accommodated all of our request. Providing meat alternatives for a vegan and vegetarian guest. All the staff at our event were pleasant. And the food was delicious! Would definitely recommend for any special event.

We used Milos for our wedding earlier this month and I have only glowing things to say. First of all, the Milos team is fantastic. Lyssa was the absolute best from the very beginning - she was incredibly responsive, answering every little neurotic question I had along the way. She even came with me to the Lasting Impressions warehouse to finalize my rental decisions because we were getting married in Columbus from out of town. And then getting to the best part - the food is DELICIOUS!! My guests raved about the short rib and the chicken, the mashed potatoes served with both were out of this world. The appetizers were also incredible - the fried chicken deviled eggs? Insane. No one left hungry - we also did the popcorn bar (I am currently eating the leftovers while I type this and it's still so good 2 weeks later) and the slider bar. I highly recommend if you are considering Milos, I don't think you are going to find a better option out there.

Two weeks after my wedding and I am still hearing from my guests that this was the best wedding food they have ever had! Scott and team were absolutely incredible, they took care of everything from setting up the napkins at each place setting, flipping my venue from ceremony to reception, clearing plates from tables, refilling waters to cleaning the reception when it was over. The staff wouldn’t even let me lift a box at the end of the day, they carried everything for me out to our cars. They were all so kind and thoughtful, I couldn’t have asked for a better experience. Scott has so much experience in the wedding world, I didn’t need a day of coordinator because he did it all for me. He made sure the flower girls went down the aisle on time, he made sure guests went to the right place for cocktail hour and served up the best food ever, followed by a beautiful and delicious dessert bar, coffee and chocolate covered strawberries. It’s all very impressive what they do and the price honestly can’t be beat!

Berwick did amazing for our wedding! We had a full buffet for 230 guests and they did an amazing job getting everyone through the line quickly. Everyone was RAVING about the food afterwards. They were also amazing in assisting with the rearranging of our tables due to some view restrictions. Super easy to work with and goes above & beyond!

From our initial meeting until my daughter's wedding day, Kohler Catering has been wonderful to work with. They have many options to fit any size budget, great staff to work with and they really care about making sure we were happy. The food was delicious. Our guests were very happy as were we. Thanks to Yvonne for helping make her wedding day a success.

I couldn’t be happier with my experience working with ElegantFare for my wedding. From the beginning, the planning process was smooth and stress-free thanks to their incredible team. Kyle, my main contact, was excellent at communication — always responsive and willing to make any changes I requested without hesitation. He made the entire planning process feel so easy. One thing I really appreciated was the wide range of menu options available. It allowed us to stay within a lower budget without sacrificing quality or variety. I was pleasantly surprised by how many great choices we had, even at a more modest price point. On the day of the wedding, the ElegantFare staff truly went above and beyond. Every staff member I interacted with — from the wait staff to the bartender — was kind, professional, and genuinely made me feel special. Their service made a lasting impression on both me and our guests. And of course, the food itself was delicious! The quality and taste were excellent, and everything was beautifully presented. I’m so glad we chose ElegantFare and would highly recommend them to anyone planning an event.

Santangelos Catering is absolutely amazing! My husband and I used them for both our rehearsal dinner and our wedding! For our wedding, we stuck with very basic options: breaded chicken, roast beef, fettuccine alfredo, and green beans with almonds. We had not one complaint about food. It has officially been one month since our wedding, and we still have people talking about the food! Now the staff. We started working with Tim as the owner, and finished with Joe and Tamara as owners. They are all so wonderful and made the transition very smooth and easy. The rest of their staff is so dedicated, hardworking, and you can tell how much they love the business and their clients! We cannot recommend Santangelos enough!

From the beginning, Josh at Creative Cuisine was amazing. I felt heard and understood about what I wanted. We wanted to keep the cost down, and CC made suggestions that stuck with our budget. They also made great recommendations and everything turned out great for our guests!
