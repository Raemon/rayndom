If I had do it all over again, I would do it exactly the same! It was a dream come true to have our wedding reception at Fort Mason and I'm so thankful to have had Shawn and the whole team at Fort Mason to assist with our wedding day. The venue is beautiful and all of our guests were stunned by the view and location.

We cannot recommend Emily and Janciz at City Club enough! They truly were the dream team that made our wedding experience completely stress-free and enjoyable, both during the planning process and on the big day. From our very first consultation, they were incredibly organized, proactive, and responsive. Planning a wedding can be overwhelming, but Emily and Janciz were always ten steps ahead, ensuring every detail was covered well in advance. Their level of professionalism and expertise was immediately apparent. We had to go back and forth on the Banquet Event Order many times because some things we thought would be fun to add (lamb shanks, french fry station, etc.) ended up compounding in price with surcharges and taxes. But, they were very willing to help us with our requests. They made us feel completely supported and heard throughout the entire journey. On the day of the wedding, everything ran flawlessly. They were constantly on top of every detail, allowing us to relax and fully immerse ourselves in the celebration. City Club is a beautiful venue, but Emily and Janciz are the incredible people who truly bring the experience to life. If you are considering City Club, you are in the best hands possible with Janciz!

We hosted our wedding at the Presidio Officers' Club and had truly the most special, incredible day of our lives. It was clean, well-organized, with delicious food and friendly staff. Not to mention, the planning team at the Presidio, through Wedgewood Weddings, was truly best-in-class. Wedgewood prepared us so well, providing a planning binder and step-by-step instructions. They checked in with us multiple times: providing walk-throughs, and answering every question extremely promptly. We especially loved our planner and day-of coordinator, Christian, who went out of his way to make everything so seamless. Christian taught us how to do our ceremony, including little details such as hand placement, went out of his way to accommodate a creative painting engagement, and provided private time for us newlyweds. He was perfect! So grateful to this beautiful venue and our wonderful team. We will treasure our experience with Wedgewood forever.

We couldn't be happier having our wedding at the University Club in April 2023. The moment we met Yvonne we knew that the University Club was the right venue for us. She is so friendly, knowledgeable and relatable. We knew that she was going to make our wedding wonderful with as little stress to us! Yvonne handled everything with ease and worked so well with our other vendors so our wedding day went flawlessly. Everyone at the University Club is so friendly and accommodating. The head bartender met with me the day before the wedding to make sure everything was perfect and she made sure I had a drink in my hand all night. The front desk staff are so helpful and made our guests feel welcome all weekend. Our guests still talk about the delicious food they had. The appetizers are amazing and the prime rib/salmon station was a huge hit. My personal favorite was the mushroom ravioli, we want to come back just for that ravioli! Everything is made onsite so the food is hot and timed perfectly with the evening. Being a more all inclusive site saved us so much hassle, not needing to worry about rentals and additional vendors showing up on time. Knowing they've done this so many times saved so much anxiety! For being an upscale venue in the heart of San Francisco, they are a very reasonably priced wedding venue, with no hidden fees at the end! Pick the University Club and dazzle your guests with delicious food and stunning views of San Francisco!

This spot worked out great for our rehearsal dinner, as we were looking for something hip and different and local in character. We rented out space at the chapel's vestry restaurant for our rehearsal dinner for 50 people. Originally we were going to have it out on the patio but it got moved because of rain inside to the chapel bar. The events manager helping us coordinate, Patricia Gums, was helpful off the bat, and the Vestry customized a menu and the space to exactly what we wanted. Everyone had a good time and the rehearsal dinner turned into a bar evening with out-of-town friends, without having to move. Check it out.

My wife and I hosted our wedding reception at the top floor of The Box SF, and had a wonderful experience! The space is beautiful and unique and we and our guests loved it. Staff during the event was very professional and courteous, and the event coordinators were stellar before during and after the event. The Box SF has a list of caterers they recommend and prefer, which made our selection process much easier (and the food was wonderful!) We elected to include the speakeasy tour as part of our reception and Mark led wonderful tours for all of the guests, it was a highlight of the event. Would definitely recommend The Box SF to anyone looking to hold a unique and classy event!

We loved having our wedding under the rotunda! It was very windy, but totally worth it.
