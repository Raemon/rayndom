I researched tons of different vendors before deciding to purchase through Kustom Koozies. They had the most customization options and the best price. They also let me review and approve the artwork before finalizing my order. The icing on the cake... we qualified for a free "bride" and "groom" koozie and 6 wedding party koozies as part of a promotional offer. Very, very happy with this purchase!

We were beyond impressed with Shin. Their creativity, professionalism, and attention to detail truly elevated our event.

Every piece that Charlie (& Bergen) custom make is excellent quality & uniquely beautiful. I have been overjoyed with my set of cornhole boards & cutting boards. Not only is his work outstanding, but he also provides tips on how to care for the products to keep them long-lasting & looking beautiful. Charlie puts so much care into his craftsmanship & it really shows!

Small Batch Specialty Gifts was great to work with on final finishing touches for my wedding day! Shannon and Ann provided a wide selection of unique goods to choose from for my guest’s welcome gifts. We worked together in designing a custom map and selection of North Carolina themed goods, I was also able to personally supply a few more items that they were happy to add to the gift box (see attached). Along with gift curation, clients can opt to have Small Batch team assemble and deliver the gifts to hotels etc. This was a huge plus, especially being out of state, as I did not have to worry about this step leading up to the weekend and in turn spend more time with my family/friends. Thank you, Small Batch, for the perfect “special something” my guests truly enjoyed!

I think my request for a live wedding picture was Amber’s first and boy did she hit it out of the ballpark. The painting was a present to the newlyweds and they were overjoyed with the end project. Amber arrived at the venue and immediately began working on the project. She worked during the ceremony into the reception to finish the absolutely beautiful piece. Amber has a God given talent that she loves to share and create beautiful and special items.

A lot of different gift ideas to choose from, the favors we ended up getting were small things that worked perfectly. Some of the gifts they have are so cute, they work as excellent favor gifts. We found everything we needed from them, and our guests liked the gifts too.
