What a great venue for our wedding ceremony! The location was absolutely beautiful with views of the lake from the terrace. In addition to the wonderful location, Kristine and Brenda were amazing! Kristine was amazing with communication leading up to the wedding, including making changes for me as we neared the wedding date. During the rehearsal and ceremony Brenda was absolutely amazing, helping us and working with the photographer to get the terrace set. I would so highly recommend going with the museum for events! Definitely contact them as they have a variety of options for all event sizes!
