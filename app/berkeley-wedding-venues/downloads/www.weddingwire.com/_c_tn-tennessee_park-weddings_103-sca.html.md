Nichols Heir was the PERFECT venue for my wedding. Living in East Tennessee my options felt somewhat limited for what I wanted: not a barn, mountain views, modern feel. When we found Nichols Heir they were still under construction but I could see the vision straight away. Every part of the space has been carefully considered and though through which made my experience all that much better. The staff were so helpful and kind.

The Mountain View’s venue is beautiful. Taylor and our day of coordinator were awesome. We wanted to include my grandmas in our ceremony as flower girls and they made sure that they were both taken care of and comfortable through the day.

We had our wedding here 10/13/23. Marlana is absolutely amazing. She keeps in touch, makes sure you vision is met, takes care of everything day of, and will even invite you over to hangout and get to know you so she can make sure everything is perfect. You can tell she does this because she loves it and not for the money. Her husband Cort makes a lot of the furniture and it's beautiful. Pretty much if it's wood he made it and he's a really awesome guy as well. I was stressing, trying to do everything on my own and she took so much off my plate. I went to help decorate day of and she told me to just go back to the cabin and relax because she had it. And always made sure we had a drink in hand to relax the nerves. lol. The day of it rained off and on. She was out there with her assistant constantly drying everything off and just making sure it stayed perfect. I had so many guests comment on how awesome and attentive she was. I swear she went above and beyond and I don't think anywhere else would do that. Thank you so much for making our day perfect! And the venue is absolutely beautiful. If I ever have another large event I would love to come back here. I will 100% recommend to any friends getting married.

I could not recommend this venue more!!! We last minute had to find a venue for our wedding because our initial location flooded due to the hurricane. Their communication was excellent, they are pleasant to work with, venue was breathtaking, and everything that we needed, they made sure we had. Absolutely went above and beyond and we are so so thankful. If you’re looking for a place to have your wedding, this is the place to be!!!

My husband and I had a very short engagement. We had 3 months to plan our wedding. We live in MS and found the Pickwick state park. We went and looked at the wedding site and everything and just fell in love with it. The room where our dinner was held was absolutely beautiful and had an amazing view of the lake. Our Dj room was very spacious and also very beautiful. The staff did a wonderful job with getting everything together, and I would definetly recomend this place to any one who is getting married.

Trying to find a wedding venue that fit our budget and theme was insanely difficult for us. I randomly came across Pinecrest after quite a few days of searching. My now-husband and I visited and fell in love with it instantly. It is a beautiful venue. And the people who work there are incredible. We worked mostly with Amanda, who was so kind, answering all of the weird questions I had, letting us come up multiple times to take measurements, test equipment, and set up. I highly recommend them.
