Amazing experience !

Simply DJs were simply amazing ! In the morning before our wedding we received a call that the DJ that had been assigned to us, Nick was on the hospital and unable to DJ our wedding . Liam and his partner would be taking over . We were concerned since we had discussed at length the specifics we wanted regarding songs , entrance etc with Nick but Liam assured us that he had all  
The info and the transition would be seamless . Well it turned out better then could have imagined - out theme was Yankee baseball and Liam also happened to be a Yankee fan and was able to add such fun to the day with providing some context to the guests regarding our very specific entrance song as well as ending the night with an impromptu song of “New York New York” since the Yankees won their game that night! I highly recommend Simply DJs for Liam as well as their extremely well oiled back up DJ process !

Best night of dancing for us and our guests!

Julius was our wedding DJ and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. He was our MC and DJ for the night. Our guests told us through the whole reception how much fun they were having with the music selection. Julius kept an open line of communication from the moment we booked with Simply DJs and even accommodated last minute changes with ease. He made sure that all our guests (from 5 to 95 years old) had music they could dance to throughout the night. Not only was he an amazing DJ, he was incredibly caring and easy to work with. We highly recommend Julius as your DJ for any event!

An incredible wedding night! 

The SimplyDJs team was incredible! It was pretty straightforward to set up our wedding night. They were able to get us some songs that were not originally in their repertoire. Even at the end of our party (only 10 minutes left) he was able to procure a song that was requested by the father of the bride. There were a few surprises along the way that made the night super exciting and memorable. Thank you to Nick and the SimplyDJs team!

10/10 STARS!!!!

We were paired with DJ Quince (emcee) and Pat C (DJ) through Simply DJ's.  
  
Wedding Ceremony: Our team arrived early and set up both in the ceremony and reception areas. These guys had everything ready to go before the ceremony start time and were incredibly professional. They found me and introduced themselves before getting to work and were incredibly professional, efficient, and brought such a good and happy vibe to our day. They gave our officiant had a microphone that projected loudly to the whole crowd and they played our requested processional and recessional songs at exactly the right times.  
  
Wedding Reception: WE HAD THE BEST TIME!!!!!! I cannot say this enough!!!! Our guests were talking about how amazing both DJ Quince & Pat C were weeks after the wedding was over. DJ Quince got everyone on the dance floor. Not only did he get everyone on the dance floor, but he got them to stay on the dance floor. He kept the guests energized, he was so fun, he kept things moving, and was really everything we could have asked for in an emcee. Pat C was on fire all night long!!! We gave them a list of 20 must-play songs and he played every single one. He also followed the vibe we asked for which was a heavy millennial mix with some newer and older songs mixed in to keep all guests happy, entertained, and dancing. I was so excited for the reception all day long and they gave us the party we were hoping to have. We just wanted to dance, party, and have the best time all night long which is exactly what these two did for us.  
  
Planning Process: We had an incredible experience from start to finish! Their website was so easy to navigate, the pricing info was clearly listed on their website which was so appreciated, and getting in touch with this company was so easy. We reached out to Simply DJ's to see if they would be a good match for our wedding (lgbt wedding) and they immediately made us feel comfortable from the start. The planning process which included review and signing of contracts, payment, and planning out the wedding day was made so easy. Throughout the whole process, they were incredibly responsive. About 2 weeks prior to the wedding, DJ Quince and I scheduled a call to review the timeline of events, the specifics of each event that would take place that day, and the words we wanted him to use to. He even accommodated some special requests which included mixing 2 songs together for my daughter/mother dance and using a specific edited version of our first dance song from YouTube.  
  
Overall: We were so happy with our decision to go with Simply DJ's and I'm so happy we were paired with DJ Quince & Pat C. They were incredible and gave us the party of our lives! I promise you won't be disappointed if you do the same.  
  
THANK YOU DJ QUINCE, PAT C, AND SIMPLY DJ's!!! :)

Would absolutely use again! 

Had an amazing experience working with Simply DJ’s for our daughter’s Sweet 16. Their price was perfect and the online portal was super easy to use and they answered all questions in an extremely timely fashion. DJ Quince was professional and personable. The zoom meeting we had with him before the party was very helpful. He was able to answer our daughter’s questions and ease her mind as well as give us an idea of how the party was going to flow. He played all the songs we put as must plays on the portal as well as took a few requests during the party. He played the perfect mix for a sweet 16. Would absolutely recommend them and use them again!

Engagement party

1000% book Nick for your upcoming event. He couldn’t have made my fiancé and I’s party run anymore smooth! He had the dance floor packed from start to finish! I don’t think I left the dance floor not once! Everyone RAVED about how excellent he did and asked me even 2 days later after my party through text if I rebooked him bc they can’t wait to party again at the wedding! i have zero complaints about him! So professional and accommodating! His energy was everything you look for when you’re trying to find your DJ for your special day!

Fantastic DJs!

Stephen DJed our wedding on 7/15 and he was the best! Was definitely the reading the room and had everyone up and dancing. We had a ton of specific wants for our cocktail music, music, and reception, and he hit everything that we wanted. And zero of the corny-ness that you might get from other wedding DJs! Cannot recommend Simply DJs enough.
