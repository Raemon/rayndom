Perfect Venue for Us

The Toll House Hotel was the perfect venue for our wedding. It accommodated 100 guests perfectly (not too crowded), the indoor/outdoor ceremony/dinner was ideal and the bridal suite onsite was perfection. The food was a highlight for the guests, a plated dinner made the affair much nicer than buffet style and I keep hearing from guests how good the food was.

As soon as my fiancé (now husband) and I had the walkthrough with the hotel's special events director, Jenn, we knew this would be the place we would get married. The hotel is very quaint, simple, and beautiful. Jenn was great to work with! We corresponded mainly through email and she always got back to us in a timely manner. She also worked with our budget to create a lovely afternoon wedding ceremony and reception for us. Jenn also made sure we had everything we needed in our hotel rooms the night before and the day of (ie. sitting stools for hair and makeup, a steamer, etc.) The food they provided for the reception was incredible, and the menu was extensive so there was something for everyone! I'm so happy that my husband and I were able to eat what we could (one advice that we received from many was to make sure that we ate during the reception!). Overall, we had a wonderful and unforgettable wedding at Toll House Hotel. We would definitely recommend this venue for those looking in the Los Gatos area.

Brynn and the team at Toll House were simply amazing. While we didn't have our actual wedding at the Toll House, all our guests stayed there for the weekend and we had a few functions at the hotel as well, including a large reception (~200 ppl). Everyone from the bell boy to the receptionists to the bartenders, everyone was extremely gracious and made all our guests feel comfortable. B/c of our large party I was a little nervous that we might be too big for the Toll House, but the Toll House did everything to accommodate us. It was truly an awesome time!

The Toll House was the perfect place for my wedding reception. The outdoor court is magical at night and the coordinator, Brynn Kessler was fantastic to work with! The price was reasonable, but we were treated like royalty.

My husband and I used the Toll House as the main place to stay for the guests attending our wedding and also hosted a breakfast the morning after our wedding in one of their banquet rooms. They made blocking the rooms easy and provided a consistent group rate for our guests. They were extremely professional, dealt with everything in a timely manner and were a pleasure to work with. They even helped us make our guests feel at home, by passing out thank you bags of goodies (provided by us) to our guests as they checked it. The breakfast the next morning was delicious. I would certainly recommend The Toll House to anyone getting married in the Los Gatos/Saratoga area.

We had our wedding party and guests stay at the Toll House. They did a wonderful job accomodating everyone, even though not much of the wedding was to take place at the hotel. Even with 4 wedding parties at the hotel that weekend, everything went very smooth and was a ton of fun as the location is ideal for the town of Los Gatos. Many guests had not ever been to Los Gatos before and absolutely loved the town. Many said they would love to return soon!

We loved the Toll House and our event coordinator Brynn. She and the staff were very flexible with our needs and everything at the reception went smoothly (wish I could say same for the church!). We had very specific ideas in mind for the theme and lay out and it came together so beautifully. They worked with us on the possible rain problem, luckily the weather held out, but the effort still appreciated. The rooms were beautiful as well and were so appreciative of the assistance Brynn offered in organizing those as well. I didn't really eat, but was told the food was great! We had a lot of out of town/country guests so the Toll House, given its proximity of just about everything (food, bars, shops, wine tasting, spa) was perfect.
