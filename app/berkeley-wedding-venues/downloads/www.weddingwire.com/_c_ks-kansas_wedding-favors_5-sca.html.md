The perfect add on to our wedding. Our guest were blown away with this party favor they got to keep. Her impressive work was the talk of the party. Looking forward to our next event.

We wanted our wedding keepsakes to pull double duty: our guests could keep their water glasses from the reception. And we wanted them to reflect us - and we are beer nerds. Grandstand allowed us to design and upload a beer logo that tied into the decor of our wedding and commemorated the date and in large quantity rather affordably! A functional keepsake that all our friends now use on the regular.

We ordered etched rocks glasses with the first initial of each of our guests. The glasses came out wonderful and the customer service was top notch. No problems in the shipping, everything was delivered intact. The glasses were very nice.

I wanted something uniquely Coloradan that would last a long time to give our guests as favors. I decided that gold-dipped aspen leaf ornaments would be perfect! This wholesale site had very reasonable prices ($6.30 apiece and $8.00 to ship 18) and the ornaments arrived very quickly. We purchased small white cardboard jewelry boxes from Michael's to place them in. After printing a thank you message on an address label and placing it on the inside of the box lid, we fastened them closed with gold cord. Our guests loved them and it was fun to see the ornaments on our families' Christmas trees this year as it will be for years to come!
