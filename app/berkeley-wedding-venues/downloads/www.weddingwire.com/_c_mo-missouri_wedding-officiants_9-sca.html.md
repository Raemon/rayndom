My wife and I were so anxious when it came to finding an officiant. We’d already been turned down by several. Annsley made us feel so comfortable and helped us express our love in a way we never thought possible.

Walter officiated our wedding on 11/23/25. From the start we knew he was the perfect officiant. I had searched for Kansas officiants who would do a "Princess Bride" movie opening to start our wedding and we found him. We talked on the phone to see if he was a good fit for us and we loved his energy and personality so much that we booked immediately, our search stopped there! He lovingly crafted the most perfect ceremony that was true to us and we are still getting compliments on our ceremony and how great he was. Extremely personable and a true delight to have as part of our wedding day. He brought us such true immense joy and the ceremony was easily the highlight of the day after getting to marry my very best friend. I would absolutely recommend him to any and everyone and honestly if I could have another ceremony just to work with him again, I would! Look no further for a diverse and customizable ceremony from someone with one of the biggest hearts around. My guests are still telling me how great he was both in ceremony and while chatting with the other guests. Walter is now like family as far as I'm concerned for how much he means to us and all he gave us. TLDR look no further for the most perfect officiant whether it be fantasy, romantic, sentimental, funny, religious, or any and all above. Absolutely one of our top vendors!

Finding and working with Terri was a joy for my wife, Kait, and I. We knew after our first virtual meeting we would be choosing her to officiate our wedding. Afterwards, we met several times for ceremony planning prior to the wedding day. She provided an in-depth overview of what to expect through her ceremony proceeding while answering every question we had along the way. We are spiritual, but not religious, and she was very helpful in bringing a personal touch to our wedding that felt like "us" while making the ceremony feel very special and fun. My wife and I are thrilled to have had Terri as a part of our big day and we would absolutely recommend Moonstone for your ceremony!

We cannot recommend Timmy enough. He was recommended by our venue (Longview Mansion in Lee's Summit) and once we checked out his reviews, we were sold. If you want a professional wedding officiant with cool vibes who is going to make your ceremony go off without a hitch, this is your guy! It was important to us that we found someone who we vibed with but who would pronounce our names correctly! We needed a professional and that is what we got with Timmy! You can tell he is comfortable speaking in front of groups of people and so you can clearly hear every word he said in our wedding video, he did not rush his words at all, and he read our ceremony script exactly as we had prepared it. 100% recommend!

He had a small ceremony with our closest family and friends at their Overland Park chapel. The chapel is beautiful. Stained glass everywhere you look, plus lanterns and candles. Are ceremony was perfect. Pastor Nancy is so kind and so loving. We couldn't have asked for anything more.

We had Rev. Dan, and he was so thoughtful and amazing. He made our day smooth sailing and unforgettable. Since the day that we booked, he was very attentive. He made sure that we had everything in order, and even thought of some things that we hadn't. I'll forever cherish the experience! Thank you again!

Mark at Simple2Elegant Weddings was our officiant and I can't thank him enough. From our initial consult to the big day, Mark ensured that our ceremony was a collaborative process between him, my husband, and me. His years of experience as an officiant, frequent communication, and thoughtfulness gave us confidence in finding the right person for our ceremony. You can't go wrong with Mark and Simple2Elegant for your wedding needs!

My daughter and son-in-law were married in September with Reverand Andrew from St Louis Wedding Chapel as their officiant. The couple had found an officiant and later determined that it wasn’t a good fit. Reverand Andrew was able to step in the last two weeks prior to the wedding. He spoke with the couple several times gaining knowledge of their history and relationship. He made them feel so comfortable and they really connected with him immediately. Reverand Andrew provided the most beautiful ceremony with a really heartfelt message. It felt as if he had known the couple for years rather than just weeks. It was truly one of the most emotional wedding messages I’ve experienced in a long while. And, in general and as expected, Reverand Andrew was on time for both the rehearsal and wedding day, ran the parts of the rehearsal that were in his purview and got out of the way for photos of the first kiss at the end of the ceremony. He also worked well with our Coordinator, Venue Director and DJ. Such a win that we were able to secure Reverand Andrew’s services at such short notice. The couple and I (MOB) highly recommend St Louis Wedding Chapel and Reverand Andrew for anyone looking for a heartfelt, emotional message and wedding ceremony.
