# About WeddingWire Editorial

Plan Your Perfect Day at WeddingWire

## Our Team

At WeddingWire, we’re here to guide you through your wedding-planning journey, cheering you on during the joyful moments and holding your hand when things get stressful. From finding local vendors to creating your wedding website, building your registry to providing expert advice and inspiration, WeddingWire is your one-stop shop for what to do, when to do it, and how to get it done. 

The WeddingWire Editorial Team works tirelessly to provide you with the up-to-date advice and inspiration you need from the moment you get engaged, through the wedding planning process, and as you enter marriage. We understand that you’re probably pretty busy with, well, life, and we absolutely respect your time and money—our goal is to cut through the noise and keep things real, so you can plan an event that reflects you as a couple. There’s a lot of wedding-relating information out there, and we want to keep the process as simple and streamlined as possible. 

Celebrating all couples is at the very heart of what we do here at WeddingWire. This is a place where love truly wins, and we welcome everyone to the table—no matter who you love or how you want to celebrate. We look forward to being a small part of your journey.
