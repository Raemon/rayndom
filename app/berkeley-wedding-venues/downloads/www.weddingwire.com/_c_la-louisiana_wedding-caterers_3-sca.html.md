We hired Fleur De Lis to cater our daughters wedding. All our communications were handled professionally, with a personal touch regarding food recommendations and pricing. Set up and execution was prompt with fresh food for all our selections. Everything tasted wonderful and the staff was friendly. They are also certified green which is another great reason to hire them. If you want great food with personalized service and environmentally conscious practices, this is your caterer!

We got married in May and our guests are STILL raving about the food (I’m writing this at the end of September)! Elysian Catering was very pleasant to work with, and incredibly attentive to all our dietary needs, helping us make sure there was something everyone could eat for our passed h’ors d’ouvres and buffet. They were even willing to make adjustments to their menu for our preferences and needs, like swapping dressings, or putting elements on the side instead of mixed in. I highly recommend them!

LaNesha and the entire Mixx team couldn't have been more attentive or helpful. We had an amazing bar experience and LaNesha went above and beyond to make our wedding special. She has such a good energy and we were just so happy we picked MIxx. We would recommend for any size wedding or party. Thanks so much LaNesha!

Kaylene, Simone and the My House team are unmatched! With a past of working in events, I know that things are bound to happen, but I truly felt like our day every single little thing was perfect and seamless to the two of us and our guests!! We went in feeling like we could trust this team with every fiber of our being, which allowed us to have the most beautiful, present, stress-free day. Cannot recommend this team enough. Big shoutout as well to the chefs we chose Michele and Joseph from Papa Joes!! They helped craft an unbelievable Portuguese-Italian fusion menu that our guests continue to rave about.

Everyone at the wedding raved about how great the food was! Mr. Gene and the entire staff was a pleasure to work with! The roast beef carving station, crawfish etouffee, pasta jambalaya, and all of the hors d'oeuvres were absolutely delicious! I wish there weren’t mushrooms in the chicken fettuccini, but that is a personal preference. Overall, I would recommend them to anyone who asked!!

The best wedding decision we made was choosing Palate to handle our catering, decor and day-of coordination. The food was AMAZING - our wedding guests are still talking about it. The decor was beautiful and exactly what I asked for. Katie did a fantastic job as my day-of coordinator - she kept everything and everyone organized and kept me as stress free as possible. My husband and I live in NYC so being able to rely on Palate to handle so many of our wedding details made our planning much easier. We felt completely comfortable knowing that Katie, Anita and Glenn were taking care of everything. I couldn't recommend Palate more.

Shelley made sure everything was perfect!! From the second line to bar setup and food, everyone was raving! The “brisket on a biscuit” was a major hit! I could not have asked for a better coordinator, bartenders, or servers. This company made our night super special. I recommend using them for any event!
