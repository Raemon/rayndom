What services does a wedding florist provide?

__

A [wedding florist provides a variety of services](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-flower-arrangements-shopping-list), some of which might not be obvious at first.

  * Consultation: Your wedding florist will meet with you to discuss your vision for your wedding—your venue, your wedding style, your desired color palette, and the types of flowers you like and dislike. Your florist will then create a proposal which will describe the arrangements he or she will create as well as the prices.
  * Samples: After you’ve signed a contract and shortly before your wedding, your florist may also provide sample arrangements to ensure that you’re on the same page about how your wedding-day flowers will look.
  * Flowers: A big part of your wedding flower budget will go to the actual purchasing of the flowers. It actually takes several hours for a florist to put a flower order together—and the flowers your florist will receive from his or her wholesaler or grower are far better quality than the ones you can buy at your local grocery store. They’re grown especially to be featured at events and are hand-selected for their quality.
  * Flower processing and storage: Once your flowers arrive to your florist, he or she will take several hours (often a whole day!) to process your flowers (taking thorns off of roses, counting the flowers, etc.) and storing them in a refrigerated space to ensure they look amazing on your wedding day.
  * Labor and production: Now, it’s time for your florist to create those beautiful arrangements! Each arrangement takes time to design (probably more than you would think!), so it’s quite a long process.
  * Delivery and set up: Your florist and his/her team will then bring your arrangements to your venue. A good amount of work needs to be done on premises to make sure that your ceremony and reception looks picture-perfect, from the altar to the reception table arrangements.
  * Cleanup: After your wedding, your florist and his/her team will go to your venue to remove all of the arrangements and vessels, and assist with cleanup.



When should I hire a wedding florist?

__

We recommend hiring your wedding florist early on in the planning process, at least eight months before your wedding day. Start by reading online reviews of florists in your wedding location, and then narrow down the list to a few that you’d like to reach out to and meet with. 

What questions should I ask a wedding florist before hiring?

__

When first meeting with a wedding florist, it’s important to get a sense of his or her experience, creativity, and personality—as well as his or her wedding flowers cost. Here are some [questions to be sure to ask a wedding florist](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-questions-to-ask-your-wedding-florist):

  * How many weddings have you done?
  * Can you offer some suggestions for creating the look I want?
  * Can you work with my wedding flower budget?
  * Do you have other weddings booked on my wedding weekend?
  * Can I see a portfolio?
  * How do you store your flowers?
  * How do you transport the flowers?
  * Are there additional fees?
  * Will you provide samples before my wedding date?
  * Which other items (vessels, rentals, etc.) can you provide, and which will I have to source myself?

From our first meeting with Claire to discuss our floral needs for our wedding day, we knew we’d be in good hands. Claire is attentive, straight forward and creative in making our ideas a reality. On our wedding day, every floral piece was brought to each location on time and appeared more beautiful than we imagined. We could not have been happier in our decision to go with Alex Waldbart Florist! - Mervin & Ema (May 2025)

One of the main reasons we booked Les Bouquets was because in our initial consultation, Elisabeth seemed genuinely excited about our ideas and vision. We are SO glad we chose her—she did an amazing job! I absolutely loved my bouquet and got SO many compliments on it. Elisabeth was lovely to work with, answering my many questions and edits. We highly recommend!

I cannot say enough how great of an experience I had working with Twisted Willow. Flowers were an important part of the day for me but I knew little on how to actually execute my vision. From the first call we had, any worries I had about the process were immediately quashed. The capable and intelligent staff walked us through the process and provided us with the perfect plan. They even helped us with budgeting out our vision so we could have the best florals for our price range. I had a lot of confidence going forward and never felt doubtful or worried about whether or not Twisted Willow would deliver. On the day of, Twisted Willow came to our venue and delivered all of the flowers and set up our displays without me even having to think about anything! In addition at the end of the night they came again to take everything down, a huge relief and great help for us! The execution of my floral plans was flawless and better than I could have expected. My wedding was last June and people are still relaying to me how beautiful the float arrangements were and how they really set the mood for the night. Overall, the entire experience was amazing and I would recommend Twisted Willow to any brides in the area!

We were so, so happy with the florals that Therese crafted for our wedding. From the moment we had our first call with Root and Relic, Therese was kind, professional, and collaborative. We knew we wanted wildflowers but weren't sure about much else. She thought to ask questions that we hadn't considered about the logistics of our wedding and was patient and flexible as we figured out what we wanted. On the day of our ceremony, we arrived to see the absolutely stunning bridal bouquet and perfect arrangements for the ceremony space that we were able to repurpose for the reception. The florals helped us feel like our wedding was beautiful, meaningful, and true to us, and they have turned out so well in all of our pictures. Thank you, Therese--we highly recommend working with Root and Relic!

The staff at Wildflowers blew us away for our wedding! I mainly worked with Joanna leading up to the wedding, and from the beginning of our meetings she listened to everything I wanted. She also provided much of her input when I needed some help deciding what would look good together. All of the arrangements on the wedding day looked beyond gorgeous! I only had colors in mind, Joanna helped us find the perfect flowers to match my style as well as the season. The staff who brought the flowers out that day were so helpful and willing to adjust when we had to make adjustments due to the weather. We could not have been more pleased with their work and customer service. They made the process easy and the flowers were beautiful!

Sisters Floral Design Studio is absolutely amazing! I cannot recommend them enough. They are personable, detail-oriented, and went above and beyond to make our wedding beautiful. They did EVERYTHING from set up, transitions, and tear down. Our wedding was in Forest Park a week after the tornado hit so we knew flowers would be a big part in beautifying our space. I was blown away with all of their work!

So glad I went with cultivated blooms! They knew my vision before I did and were incredibly professional. Their prices were very reasonable and the flowers were stunning! The groomsmen also loved the magnet clasps for their boutonnières rather than the traditional pin. 10/10 review, would recommend to a friend!

We work for Fletcher’s flowers for my bridal bouquet, flower girl, crowns, petals, grooms square flower pocket and boutonnieres. Not only were they reasonably priced, but the flowers were gorgeous. We were able to see the bouquet the day before the wedding and made small adjustments, so it was exactly what I wanted the day of the wedding. I thought it was absolutely beautiful. I’d recommend to anyone.

I struggled so hard finding anyone who could help materialize my floral arrangements. I had I had a festive woodsy wedding with bright jewel tones and every floor is looked at me like I was crazy. Colleen eventually took on the task and did an amazing job. My wedding wouldn't have been the same without her arrangements. I was desperate after a failed attempt with another florist and left with a bunch of random silk flowers and she took on the task of making every flower matter and it looked absolutely fabulous. I couldn't think her enough. If you are in a similar situation, definitely visit the shop and Colleen will help you a bunch.

I could not recommend Jenna enough. She brought to life my dream wedding florals from my bouquet to the ceremony. Everything was elegant and beautifully made. Although we were miles away, her communication was great and she ensured everything was confirmed and exactly how I wanted it before our big day. I loved my wedding bouquet so much that it is now framed in our home for everyone to enjoy!
