I can’t begin to describe how incredible Sonya was throughout every step of our wedding! From the pre-planning, vendor coordination, rehersal, during the ceremony/ reception to post wedding commitments, she was incredible. She was so professional and thorough in communication to us, our wedding party, guests and vendors. She thought of everything and was prepared for anything. Our wedding could not have gone as smoothly without her. We are so grateful we had Sonya as our wedding planner!

I initially thought I could handle planning my wedding on my own, but I quickly became overwhelmed—especially when it came to coordinating with all of our vendors. That’s when I found Ayden online, and from that moment on, she became an absolute lifesaver. She immediately understood my vision and helped me get organized with templates and tools that made planning so much easier. No matter how many changes or unexpected details came up, she was always willing to take on whatever I threw her way. We ran into multiple challenges with our vendors, and Ayden was truly our superhero. She seamlessly took over coordination, relieving me of so much stress. She managed over eight vendors, even finding waitstaff when our caterer struggled to recruit enough for our remote location. Her ability to handle these last-minute issues with ease was incredible. One of my biggest concerns was how the wedding rehearsal and overall schedule would flow, but Ayden had everything under control. She made sure every member of our wedding party knew exactly where they needed to be and when—even helping the groomsmen with their ties! Ayden went above and beyond to ensure our wedding day was absolutely perfect. I cannot recommend her highly enough to anyone in need of an exceptional wedding planner!

Kelcey is the absolute GOAT wedding planner. My wife and I live in Los Angeles, CA and were planning a wedding south of Portland, ME, and found Kelcey through an online search. We had an initial call with her and immediately felt like she would be a great fit for our personalities as well as navigating the challenge of planning a wedding from 3,000 miles away. And we couldn't feel more lucky that we found her and her team! Kelcey is extremely professional and from the get-go we understood exactly what he had signed up for and what to expect from her services. At no point in the process did we ever feel like she was stressed or overwhelmed with what we were asking and she always was able to lead us in the direction that ended up being the perfect outcome for us as a couple. Her communication is top-notch and she has a way of working that makes you feel at ease and relaxed. Kelcey's vendor recommendations for catering, photography, flowers, stationary, etc. are also 10/10 which made the process that much easier. The weekend of the wedding, Kelcey and her team were so pleasant to be around, and they were able to seamlessly help direct and ensure things went on without a hitch while also remaining relatively unnoticed. We had multiple events including two bands and a silent disco and all were executed perfectly. She understands the vibe and flow of a wedding really well and that was a big aspect that we wanted to nail. Kelcey makes you feel like someone you want to hang out with even after the festivities are over. She is someone we hope to stay in touch with and would highly recommend her over and over to anyone getting married in an area that she services. 10/10 could not have asked for a better wedding planner. Thank you, Kelcey!

If you're in search of a wedding planner who can turn your vision into a flawless reality, look no further than Olive and Co. Cassie and her exceptional team were the backbone of our wedding, and their dedication and expertise made our wedding better than we could have ever imagined it. From start to finish, Cassie was a beacon of support and professionalism. She meticulously helped me think through every detail, ensuring that nothing was overlooked and that our vision was executed perfectly. No question was too small or too complex—Cassie was always there to provide thoughtful answers and guidance throughout the entire process. What truly set Cassie and her team apart was their extraordinary level of care. When a friend had an allergic reaction at our wedding, Cassie didn’t hesitate to step in and help. She lent her own car to get our friend to the ER, quite literally going above and beyond. If you’re planning a wedding or event in Maine, Olive and Co is an absolute must. Their unparalleled dedication, impeccable organization, and genuine care will ensure that your event is executed seamlessly and with heart. We couldn’t have asked for a better team to bring our dream day to life.

Ali was an absolute delight to work with as our wedding coordinator. I am a type A organized person and letting some tasks go are sometimes hard for me. From the moment we talked with Ali she was incredible sweet and helpful- she truly wanted to get to know us as a couple and get our ideas for what we envisioned for our wedding day. We had planned phone calls, zooms and unlimited emailing and help to any questions we had. She gave us a detailed booklet to fill out of bridal party info, vendors, details and décor for the wedding day, which let me tell you eased my mind drastically. I knew Ali and I were on the same page, and she understood the assignment. Ali and her team were wonderful. We ended up working with Ali and Jillian and let me tell you they we’re incredible. They came by for rehearsal and got to know us, our family and the bridal party. They we’re helpful, patient, kind, and everything we had hoped we get for a wedding planner. Come wedding day, they finalized all the finishing touches and made sure I didn’t have to worry about a single thing- which I didn’t. I cannot tell you the amount of relaxation, stress-free, fun, and loving environment they created for us. It was amazing, so special to have they be apart of our wedding day. I couldn’t have asked for a better team to work with, they truly helped make our dreams become a reality. This was the best day of both my wife and I’s lives, and we couldn’t have done it without Ali and Jill. In a heartbeat I would hire them over and over again and recommend them to anyone looking for extraordinary people to help make their wedding day magical. Thank you so very (cherry) much to Ali and Jill for everything they have done for us!

Working with Wendy and Sarah was, by far, the best part of our wedding planning process. They made us feel so at ease at every stage of the journey, communicated regularly, and went above and beyond with concerns regarding our venue. We live out of state, so it gave us so much peace of mind to work with people who knew the local community. The rehearsal and wedding day went off without a hitch; we had the best time! I can't stress enough how happy we were to have worked with Dragonfly Services and how difficult planning would have been without them. Thank you!!

Krista Hastings...we could not have done it without her! We had a "destination" wedding in Maine this fall. Destination, as we both live elsewhere but I'm from Maine. We hired her mostly for week-of-the-wedding services, although she did suggest a few vendors in the area. My only real quibble is that in the pre-wedding phase (not the week before), she was a bit busy or maybe overextended. But once she's focused on you, that's all you need. The week of the wedding, she was absolutely indispensable. We met a week before the wedding and reviewed all the things left to do. Everything got done and then some. She handled everything with calm and consummate professionalism. She was even able to coral our boisterous (and probably already tipsy) wedding party through the rehearsal with skill. She has a plethora of tools in her van for any last-minute hiccup, including a printer! The day-of preparations went incredibly smoothly...every last detail did not escape her notice. The reception came off without a hitch. And the chaos of the morning after wasn't so much chaos after all thanks to Krista. Moreover, she does everything with warmth, good humor, and a smile. I never want to plan a wedding again, but if I had to, I'd hire her again in a heartbeat.

Meagan was so great to work with throughout wedding planning. She was super organized, so responsive, always on time, and so kind. I believe the vibe that someone brings to your wedding is very important. On our wedding day, Meagan was a calming presence. Everyone said it was the most relaxed and joy filled wedding they had ever been to. We are so grateful to Meagan, and highly recommend working with her!

Audrey is amazing! From helping with setting up the day before the wedding to pre-planning almost a year ahead of time! I would have been lost without Audrey. The wedding invitations that Joe did for me got rave reviews from everyone who received them! From the smallest details to the big picture everything on my wedding day and before turned out perfect thanks to Audrey....No question would I recommend her to each and every bride I meet!
