DJ Doug was the perfect addition to our wedding! He made sure the energy on the dancing floor was always high. The dance floor was packed all night! Most importantly, he was always checking in with us as the bride and groom to make sure everything was going exactly as we wanted. As an added bonus, he recorded a video of all of our guests dancing to the last song of the night. This is something so special that will we treasure looking back on forever!

Sounds Great Entertainment, ran by Dale, is the DJ you want for your event. For me it was my wedding. He made the planning process seemless, with a few meetings to gameplan the big day. Brought expertise on what is 'cool' to do at the moment. Help with additional songs we didn't know we needed. Made our reception go perfectly. He even showed up in a snowstorm for our wedding. Dale is upbeat, excited for event, fun, a great DJ, and a better MC for your event. You can not have a better DJ.

They will create the environment you want. We wanted to dance all night and they made that happen. They catered to our requests of playing songs we wanted and avoided songs we did not want to hear. We wanted late 90s and modern music that makes you dance. We also wanted Lebanese dabke music, Punjabi music, Indian music and Latin music. They played all of that! Kept us dancing all night! Highly recommend them to everyone.

Andrew came through for us. I always knew the music at my wedding was going to be carefully selected song for song, and even in a particular order and Andrew stuck by it and let me do my thing. He delivered exactly what I wanted and was SO easy and fun to work with. He was even willing to take specific song files (files I downloaded from very specific CD’s lol) and hearing those exact versions play amongst all my favorite people on my wedding day was an absolute surreal dream come true. Any request that was made, Andrew nailed. I couldn’t be more thankful for TeamDJ and Andrew.

We worked with Eric “The Bearded DJ” leading up to our wedding. He was very prompt and detailed in his responses and provided honest opinions that were helpful in planning! We are so happy with how the music turned out. If you like remixes and a great flow to the music that gets everyone out on the dance floor, Eric is your guy. He was taking requests from guests but still kept true to our style and preferences. You could tell he was working hard all night, sweating bullets and deeply engaged in his work. His passion and knowledge of music is what truly brought the dance floor together. We also used the Cleveland Music Group for uplighting around the ballroom, and they brought their own lights to put on the stage and make the DJ’s set up stand out! We had the best night of our lives and woke up with extremely sore calves from dancing all night!

I decided a little over a month before my wedding that I wanted a DJ. Less than 20 minutes after my vendor request Fred called me to get all the details. 10 minutes after that he sent me the invoice and assigned me Andrew. Andrew was AMAZING. All I gave him on our phone call was vibes and he NAILED IT. He routinely checked in on my throughout the wedding and even went with the flow when things ran behind or were added. Andrew and Fred were perfect and the pricing was PERFECT!!!

The DJ’s were up dancing and having a great time with the rest of the wedding guests while keeping full control over the board and music. They were so much fun, kept the party lively, played any requests, and kept us moving on our previously agreed upon schedule. It was perfect.
