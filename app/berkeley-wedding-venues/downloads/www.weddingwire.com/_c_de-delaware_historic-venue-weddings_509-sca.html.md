Bellevue Hall was so stunning during our walkthroughs prior to the wedding, and even more stunning day of! This is an amazing and unique venue. The house was so beautiful that we didn’t need a ton of decor for it look gorgeous. The tent is huge - we had a band, 18 tables, and a big dance floor and it didn’t feel cramped inside. We worked with Madeline as our venue coordinator and she made the planning process easy. We had some religious requirements for the wedding that hadn’t been done yet at Bellevue, which Madeline and JAM were very receptive to. They accommodated us with extra walk throughs, extra planning time, and a custom floor plan/alcohol package. Madeline communicated beautifully with our day-of-coordinator and other vendors to make it an amazing day!

Highly recommend - we loved the food and so did our guests! The coordinator (Morgan) was always available for any questions that came up. Everything went smoothly and perfectly. I can’t recommend their catering enough. The staff was pleasant and gave excellent service.

Furnace Town is beautiful and there's so many options as a venue and It's one of the best values for your money. It's great if you're looking for something different then the everyday wedding venues in the area.

Crystal, the coordinator, was the absolutely best. She was absolutely helpful from the moment we started planning to the moment I left my wedding night. I forgot my bouquet moments before I was about to walk down the aisle and that women RAN for it. She was so helpful for every single part of our wedding. The venue is stunning, lots of land to work with. The mansion, the barns, the land, you have access to all of it. Very big event space. 10 out of 10 would recommend. The photos I have right now don't even come close to how beautiful my big day was
