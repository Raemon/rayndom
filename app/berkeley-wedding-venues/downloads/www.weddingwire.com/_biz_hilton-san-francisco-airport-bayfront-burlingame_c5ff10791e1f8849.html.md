We inquired a year ago September with Brenda Portos and from the first day to the day of our event she was always professional and willing to meet our every need. Both Banquet Managers Merek and Minor gave us just the same exact service as did the entire staff. I have been an Event Planner in the bay area for nearly 40 years and worked with all the Hiltons in the area and by far this staff has far exceeded any location I have worked with!

We had a great time working with Hilton SFO as our wedding venue! All the staff members were so friendly and helpful, especially Brenda, Marek, Mynor, and Jared. We would highly recommend this venue to anyone planning to hold their wedding reception in the Bay Area.

We had both our Wedding Ceremony & Reception at the Hilton in Burlingame (200 guests). We had history staying at the hotel in the past and also with the local area and knew we didn't want our wedding anywhere else. We wanted a venue that could do it all without having our guests or ourselves travel in between and we also wanted a place where we could stay overnight as well, basically a one stop shop! The Hilton fulfilled all our requirements. We had some "unique" ideas/themes, but they were able to accommodate us on all of them! We had a huge dance floor and the lighting was so nice! The space looked amazing!  
  
The original Hilton events manager we initially met had taken a new position several months before our wedding and we were a bit worried, but Brenda P. took over and got us all sorted out! She was great to work with and so accommodating!!!  
  
Oh I guess we should talk about the dining! We had the Very Violet plated dinner and we didn't have not one complaint from any of the 200+ guests! We both had the steak and enjoyed it!

We held a school fundraiser at The Hilton Hotel Burlingame on Saturday night and everyting was perfect. We booked the venue close to a year before the event and one of the reasons we used this location over the many others we looked at was Jessica Chang. She was welcomng, courteous and professional. Over the year we had numerous meetings with Jessica and she addressed all of our requests with ease and came up with solutions to our concerns.Jessica was always available and flexible when we requested meetings. On the night of the event we had over 300 guests and not only was it a fun evening, it was also successful. The flow between the ballroom and spectrum room (where we had our silent auction) was perfect. The ballroom is designed so that no-one is too far away from the center (where the auctioneer was) which led to a successful live auction. Jessica and the captains ran a very efficient dinner service and the food was perfect. The evening was smooth and without stress for us as co chairs thanks to the professionalism of Jessica and her staff!!

Finding the right venue isn't easy when planning a wedding. My husband and I just got married and had our reception at the Hilton. Can I just say, AMAZING! Best decision we made for our wedding. Literally everything came out perfect and exceeded my expectations. Jessica is amazing and went above and beyond for us. I felt like I was taken care of for such a big moment in our lives for my husband and I. Having the right people on your side is a great thing and Jessica really takes care of her clients. I can not express how thankful I am to everyone at the Hilton for everything they have done for our special day! Everything was beautiful and the food was amazing! The staff and service were excellent. If you are in doubt and can't figure out a place for your wedding reception, choose the Hilton and know you will be taken care of!!!!!

I love the staff here especially the Senior Catering Sales Manager,Jessica. We had our wedding reception at the ballroom last January 9, 2016. She was very responsive and professional. Jessica was very accommodating, patient and friendly! She made our planning go so much easier and was there for us each step of the way and she was so much fun to talk to. I had bad experiences with other hotel chains around the area so I was so relieved and happy to have met such an awesome Catering Manager. Jessica helped with the food tasting, the scheduling of the program, and coordinating with my wedding planner and other vendors. She is very helpful and flexible with our needs. I would definitely recommend the food and service here was awesome.  
  
My family and I as well as the wedding party also stayed at this hotel the day before and the day of the wedding. The hotel rooms were clean and we had a gorgeous view of the bay. I'm so grateful for the staff who made my wedding reception go as smoothly as possible especially to Jessica.

I recently had my wedding at the Hilton Bayfront in October and so happy that we chose it! The ballroom is the most gorgeous in the Peninsula! The chandeliers were what sold me and not to mention the walls on the sides of the ballroom that light up were an added bonus. We had 300 guests including the wedding party- I was a little scared that the ballroom would be too tight but it worked out perfectly and we still had an intimate wedding without feeling crowded.   
  
Jessica Chang was the absolute best to work with! She really knows her stuff and goes to extremes to make sure the bride and groom are happy. She isn't afraid of being honest with you without stepping on your toes. She truly cares about the end result and will work with you to make sure you are happy and your day is perfect. She is super professional and accommodating, which is exactly what you need during such a hectic wedding planning time. We had an emergency the day of the wedding that had nothing to do with her or her team and she went to extremes working with my vendors to make sure the problem was fixed so I wouldn't be disappointed. I do recommend hiring a day-of coordinator or a family friend to deal with all the important things that bring your wedding vision to life as well as the timeline of the night, which I did. Jessica is technically only responsible for the hotel and her catering staff so hiring an extra person is totally worth it!  
  
I had full confidence in her to handle my crazy wedding planning! She's amazing to work with and the Hilton Burlingame is a beautiful hotel to host your wedding reception!!
