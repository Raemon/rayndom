Wedding of my dreams

I can’t speak highly enough of the Kentucky Derby Museum for helping me with the wedding of my dreams.   
  
The event space has been updated in the recent years and has made it a elite experience. Nothing is more iconic than I’m getting married in Kentucky at Churchill Downs but with the history of the museum. A lot of of our guests were out of town and it really got them to experience and appreciate the history of Kentucky.  
  
I can’t speak Kylie enough about working with Maddy. She made the experience amazing, answered all my emails in a timely manner accommodating to all my rrequest! I wish I could work with her all the time!

Amazing staff, amazing venue! 

My husband and I could not have asked for a better experience than what the Kentucky Derby Museum provided for us. The entire staff were beyond amazing, making sure every detail of our vision was brought to life. The venue was stunning, the food was delicious and the setup was absolutely beautiful! Everything from the beginning to the end was done so effortlessly and we cannot thank each and every one of you enough for providing such exceptional service. We look forward to working with the KDM again in the future and highly recommend anyone looking for a venue for all occasions to consider the Kentucky Derby Museum!

Ever since I moved to Louisville, I knew that if I ever got married, this is where I wanted to have the wedding. Lucky for me my dream came true! Our wedding went off better than I ever could have imagined. The staff at the Derby Museum was very patient and accommodating with all our requests. They helped arrange everything that evening so that things went extremely smoothly. I never had to worry about a thing. The outdoor area made for a great ceremony and gorgeous photos. The indoor area for the cocktail hour and reception was absolutely the best. Our out of town guests loved being able to see the museum during cocktail hour, and we are still receiving compliments about how wonderful the venue was. If you are looking for a Louisville original for your wedding, with staff that is the best, look no further than the Derby Museum!

What a great venue for a wedding reception! My out-of-town guests loved having full access to the KY Derby Museum during the reception. The kids were entertained with museum activities too. I definitely recommend using the 360 video screen to show the history of the KY Derby movie as guests are being seated...and to display a slide show of pictures of the bride and groom on the same screen during dinner. Andrea and Kim were very responsive and patient in answering all of my questions. But, hands down, the best part of the night was when Steve (the track bugler) played "The Call to the Post" prior to announcing our arrival and introducing us as husband and wife.
