We used Duvall Catering for our 110 person wedding - not only did Duvall offer the most competitive rate dollar wise, but they offered the BEST wedding food I have ever had. We did 3 stations for dinner and every station was phenomenal. All night long and the next day our guests were raving about how good the food was. NOW THE STAFF!!!! Alicia is who I worked with for quotes and the tasting and she is a gem, so easy to work with and very responsive. The crew on the day of the wedding day.... omg they were seriously incredible. So kind and brought the best vibes. They were treating our guests like family and it was incredible. Thank you Duvall for making our wedding day perfect.

So often at weddings you expect the food to be just “okay,” but we were determined to have truly delicious food at our wedding, and Cozy Kitchen Catering completely exceeded every expectation. The food was absolutely delicious; flavorful, fresh, and beautifully presented, and on top of that, very reasonably priced, which is rare for wedding catering. Katie went above and beyond by creating a custom menu that perfectly fit our vision while also helping us stay within budget. She truly sold us during the tasting! Every single dish was so good that we knew immediately we were in the right hands. Katie was incredible to work with. She was professional, organized, and truly a superstar at handling a large group with ease. She is incredibly talented, has a heart of gold, and genuinely cares about her clients and their guests. Everything ran smoothly and our guests could not stop talking about how amazing the food was! If you’re looking for outstanding food and a stress-free experience, I can’t recommend Cozy Kitchen Catering enough!

As an event coordinator, Brand Bars is always the first bar service I go to. They are professional, always on time, friendly, and a great value for their service. Not to mention their choices of beer, wine, and their cocktails are delicious! Would highly recommend Brand Bars for anyone looking for bar service for their big day or any event!

It’s hard to know where to start in sharing our amazing experience with Palmetto’s Catering for our son’s wedding party. First, Teri was great to work with. So knowledgeable and helpful in planning and organizing the event. Not only the food but the room, tables and design. As for the actual food, it truly was amazing. Palmetto’s is known for its BBQ and oysters but their offering is so much more. We had heavy hor d’oeuvres instead of a sit down dinner. Their selection of menu items is expansive and they nailed each and every one. From the Cajun chicken brochettes to the Tiramisu. Appetizer table with cheeses, meats and fruits. The presentation of all was beautiful while they maintained freshness at all times. Their on site staff at the event was exceptional too. Very professional and attentive to all our needs. Last but not least, the value for what we experienced was great. Thanks again to Teri and Palmetto’s Catering and Event Center for helping to make our party special for our son and new bride.

Coastal crust was outstanding at our wedding! We hired their pizza truck as a late night food option and they did not disappoint. Not only was the pizza absolutely delicious, but their staff went above and beyond and even came out to our dance floor to hand out some slices which our guests loved!! We would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for catering for a wedding or any other event!

Although a bbq vendor was not my first thought, my husband and I were thrilled at the fact that Piggie Park offered all of the items that we wanted to serve. Mainly soul food and comfort foods is what we had in mind, and Maurice’s Piggie Park checked off every item with great flavor. We even got the leftovers wrapped up and stored neatly to take home after the event

The Relish Team crushed it at our wedding!! We used them for the rehearsal dinner and wedding reception and it couldn't have been better. Lacy, Chris, and the whole crew were such a pleasure to work with and the food was AMAZING! All our guests are still talking about the edible spoons weeks later, cannot recommend them enough!

Larry and his fabulous team are extremely gifted in party preparation and menus. The food was excellent and everyone wanted to know who did it. The variety of options he suggested was right on target for the friends attending. They arrived on time, set up a beautiful table with all the little trimmings for each dish. I wish I could describe each dish. Choose Larry Reeves Catering for any event!

We were first introduced to Salthouse when our DIL hired them to cater her wedding to our son. We enjoyed the tasting so much that we hired them to cater the rehearsal party. When our daughter got engaged, Salthouse was the first vendor we hired. The wedding was beautiful, and the food was outstanding. We received dozens of compliments on the food and the great service. Jacqueline and her team were great to work with- super friendly and professional. We wholeheartedly recommend Salthouse Catering!
