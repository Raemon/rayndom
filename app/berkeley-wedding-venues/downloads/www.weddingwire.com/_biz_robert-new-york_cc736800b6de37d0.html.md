Perfect NYC Wedding Venue

We had our wedding at Robert on March 29, 2025. It was the perfect day. My husband and I were so amazed by how everything turned out, and are incredibly grateful to Kristi, Richard, and the entire staff at Robert for making our vision come to life and providing top-tier service. We received so many compliments from our guests about the beautiful space, wonderful views, and amazing food. This is an outstanding venue that I cannot recommend enough.

The perfect city venue

The moment we stepped into Robert we knew this was our venue -- the colorful vibes and gorgeous city view spoke to us. We worked with Kristi to plan the wedding reception of our dreams at Robert. Not only was the food and staff phenomenal, but they were flexible about making our dreams come true -- including having a surprise performance from our drag queens! Our guests were blown away by how gorgeous the restaurant was and how delicious and beautifully plated the food was.   
  
It was an unbelievably special night. The team at Robert was responsive, professional, and made our wedding experience such a joy. A real highlight of wedding planning was doing the tasting menu at Robert with our moms -- they could not stop raving about the food.   
  
Thank you for your attention to detail, promptness, and true excitement for our big day. If we could get married again, we would do it all over at Robert. Thank you all!

Best. Day. Ever!!!

We chose Robert as the venue for our wedding this past November. From the earliest stages of the planning process, Kristi made us feel confident and comfortable. She was always easy to reach for any questions and gave us her full attention. The venue itself is unique, has its own charm and the most stunning views of Central Park which are sure to wow your guests. However, the view comes as a close second to the food! We and our guests were absolutely blown away by the detail put into the food. Each entree was spectacular and cooked exactly how each guest requested. Throughout the day, Richard and the staff were always attentive, making on the fly decisions to maximize the celebration of our wedding and take away any stresses that could have occurred. Overall, the complete harmony of the staff and unique venue make Robert a great choice for those looking to host a party of any variety.

Perfect Wedding

Robert was a wonderful place to have a reception, with Kristi as a fantastic event manager and Richard as day-of coordinator. They were incredibly helpful and professional, and quick to answer all of our questions as the day came nearer and set up a tasting to help choose our menu. Also of course the space is beautiful, the decorations perfect, the views amazing, and the food absolutely delicious. We got many rave reviews from our guests of the food! They easily had an open bar, live piano, and cocktail hour with activities after dinner. They were very accommodating and helped us with table set up, activities, cake cutting, a screen for photos, and house music. Would strongly recommend it as a place to host any event as there were no hiccups at all. We are very glad we managed to snag it for our wedding!

Absolutely perfect!

I'll start by saying that Robert was the perfect venue for our wedding this past April 2024. My husband and I met here in NYC and, after a long search for wedding venue possibilities, chose Robert. We wanted a venue that our guests from all over the country could enjoy. NYC is a very special place for us, and this venue hits all the marks! The sunset after a cocktail hour made for beautiful pictures! This space has so much color and happiness, and it was a dream come true. The food and drinks were delicious and vibrant. It was the perfect space for our piano-themed wedding. Robert was gracious enough to let us use the beautiful grand piano as our entertainment for the night. The layout was perfect, so our guests could hear and see the piano while singing along. Alex, Richard, and the entire Robert team went way above and beyond what we could have envisioned for our wedding day. I can't thank them enough for their hard work in making it all happen.  
  
Anna Gianfrate was our amazing and talented NYC and Italy photographer who captured all the beauty and memorable moments.

Artsy Flora made the most beautiful and fun floral arrangements that tied into Robert's overall decor.

Butter Cup Bake Shop designed our beautiful and unique cake! It was just what I wanted!

Absolutely amazing!!

Kristi and Richard, along with the entire staff at Robert, were absolutely amazing to work with for our wedding!!   
  
As industry veterans with over 20+ years of experience, Kristi and Richard ensured that the entire planning process was seamless, while also providing us with helpful suggestions and tips, so that every little detail was perfect for our ceremony on the 7th floor and reception at Robert.   
  
In addition to Robert's high level of service, guests still rave about the quality of the food and how the entrees were cooked perfectly...in all honesty, having been to 25+ weddings in my life, including many other top venues in NYC, I'm still in shock that the chef at Robert was able to prepare 100+ perfectly-cooked branzino and medium-rare filets.   
  
Needless to say, given the service and food, I would 10000% recommend Robert to anyone considering it as a wedding venue...and on top of it, the breathtaking views of Central Park don't hurt either!!

Outstanding venue with classic New York City view & amazing food

We had our wedding at Robert in January with 84 guests and our ceremony on the 7th floor. Working with the Robert team was extremely easy and our coordinator, Kristi as well as Richard were absolutely excellent. The venue did not push back on any of our requests and truly made our day spectacular. The space has a beautiful modern design and the view of Columbus Circle and Central Park is iconic. The food is a culinary experience and our guests are still raving about it. If you are looking for a classic New York City venue and a highly professional detail oriented team to work with I highly recommend Robert.

Perfect Wedding 

Having our wedding at Robert at The Museum of Arts and Design was truly our dream come true. We had about 120 guests, with our ceremony on the 7th floor and our cocktail hour & reception in the restaurant on the 9th floor. The venue has outstanding views and amazing food which our guests continue to rave about! Working with Kristi and Richard to plan our event was seamless. They were incredibly responsive, kind, professional, and devoted to making our vision come to reality. They collaborated with our other vendors to provide suggestions and ideas which was greatly appreciated. I would highly recommend this unique and stunning venue!

One of a kind venue with food to die for! 

A year ago, my partner and I had no idea what a 'dream wedding' looked like. After having our special day at Robert and the MAD Museum Theater, it's hard to imagine our wedding without them! From the first second we walked into Robert, just to try their food (hold on, I'll get there!), we found a hidden gem that was somehow like nothing we'd ever seen and so quintessentially New York a the same time. Robert has stunning art, a beautiful view, a calm and cool ambiance which all make it a great place for brunch or dinner. What made it perfect for our 75 guest wedding is the people. Emma and Richard left nothing to chance, offering gentle suggestions, providing feedback from their years' experience and just generally letting us know that our day was as important to them as it was to us. I'm not Beyonce (unfortunately), but the care and attention I received from the staff at Robert is probably the closest I'll get.   
  
Something you'll only get at Robert is a seamless transition from the stunning views of Columbus Circle, to a romantic yet hip lounge vibe once the sun goes down. Everything down to the future is unique and the suggestions the team offered (keeping the cocktail tables and lounge couches for the dance floor? being comfy never looked that good!), were just perfect.  
  
The venue also has several options for your ceremony, but we opted to use the theater, and took advantage of every amenity - from the huge projector screen for a 10 foot tall montage of our dog, to the in house A/V set up for our vows, to the two aisles for our joint walk down the aisle, all the way to the stage which was the perfect size for our Elvis impersonator. Rebekkah and her team were attentive, kind, and warm throughout and made sure we had nothing to worry about!   
  
I cannot recommend Robert/the MAD Theater enough. It's been months and our friends are still raving about the food, the wine, the atmosphere, and the kind, warm staff that made our day truly perfect!
