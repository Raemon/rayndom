Unique venue

Museum of the Moving Image is not your typical wedding venue - which is exactly what we wanted. BG, our venue coordinator was such a pleasure to work with. This was the first venue we visited and instantly knew it was the one for us, a lot of which is down to the level of service BG provided. We had just shy of 100 guests, reception in the main hall, and used the Red Stone Theatre for the ceremony. Our guests LOVED that they had access to the museum throughout the night, it was such a fun and interactive night for them. We're so glad we chose MOMI as our venue and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for something different and quirky, thank you to BG and the whole MOMI team!

Couldn't have imagined a better venue for our wedding!

As fans of film and especially the Museum of the Moving Image, the museum quickly became one of our first choices to host our wedding, even though it was not the first one we toured. We both had a personal attachment to the museum, but this experience has helped us truly fall in love with it. After reaching out to BG Hacker, the museum’s Director of Events, we scheduled a meeting to discuss the capabilities of the venue, to take a quick tour of the museum (through the eyes of hosting our entire event), and go over details of other weddings they’ve hosted in the past.   
  
BG was able to provide names and contact information for a variety of vendors who have worked with the museum in the past, to help give us a more detailed picture of what we would be able to customize to see if the museum was the right venue for our wedding and budget. When we concluded that the museum was the perfect place to host our wedding ceremony and reception, BG was enthusiastically helpful through the entire process. He helped coordinate vendors, answered countless emails at all hours and with several last minute requests, and he was excited to help us in the planning for our big day. While the museum has some constraints compared to other venues, it also offered a unique setting for our ceremony and reception which certainly dazzled us and our guests.   
  
Our guests are still talking about just how much they enjoyed the space, being able to interact with the exhibits and view this museum in a different context. We opted for the Flipbook package which just added so much to the evening for our guests and we adore having copies of all that were made to flip through ourselves. Many said they would be coming back to experience the museum again in the future and so will we!

MOMI was the perfect wedding venue for us since we both love film. But even if you aren't a movie buff, the MOMI is an incredible venue - it looks amazing, its spacious and easy to get to, and (the best part) your guests get to explore all of the fun and interactive exhibits!   
  
We also had the pleasure of working with BG Hacker, the museum's event coordinator, who always made us feel like we were in good hands. He was responsive and helped us work out all of the little details that go into making a wedding a success. One thing we were worried about was our decision not to hire a DJ and instead have my husband do the music himself -- BG and his staff really helped with all of the technical elements and the music elements turned out great!   
  
We can't recommend MOMI enough!

The MOMI was our PERFECT wedding venue. We were able to do the ceremony and reception seamlessly in one spot, and BG, Director of Events, was above and beyond amazing. He was so organized and responsive, and recommended wonderful vendors for everything we needed. It is the perfect spot for a unique NYC wedding, and it's such a treat to be able to use the entire venue (exhibits included) for the big day. You can personalize so many things at the venue (show home videos, project photos, pick your ceremony background, etc) and it is absolutely perfect for pictures and photo ops. The entire staff was extremely prompt, responsible, friendly and professional from the event tour up until the big day. BG helps you stay organized to ensure ever detail is ironed out to make the day absolutely perfect and stress free. I cannot say enough good things about BG and his team at the MOMI!

Choosing the Museum of the Moving Image as our venue was easily the best decision we made in planning our wedding. Within minutes of entering the museum for the first time, we knew we had to have our wedding here.  
  
When taking on something as stressful as wedding planning, it’s crucial to find people who are resourceful and easy to work with. For us, that person was BG Hacker, the museum’s director of events. From the moment we met with BG and began to bombard him with questions, he made us feel so comfortable and welcome. And he was extremely accessible throughout the process, as we developed an ambitious ceremony (music, choreography, etc.) that required many follow-up visits, calls, and emails. BG was a huge part of making our experience at the museum a fantastic one, and we’ll always be grateful for his care and expertise that helped our big night go so smoothly.  
  
It’s been more than two years, and we still have friends and family telling us how special our wedding was and what a wonderful time they had at the ceremony/reception. The museum’s Sumner M. Redstone Theater is an amazing room that lets you amp up production, whether you’d like to project photos and/or video on the big screen, play music on the crisp sound system, adjust the lighting exactly to your preference, or decorate the stage and aisles with your choice of materials.  
  
The cafe/reception area’s minimal white décor provides a blank canvas. It’s the perfect space for drinks, food, and dancing, and your arrangement options are limitless: formal dinner tables, buffet-style fare, etc. The cafe counter is conveniently located to serve as a bar, and there’s a lovely courtyard outside that works nicely for shooting photos.  
  
Our guests loved browsing the galleries and interactive exhibits during the reception; they even created their own flip books, which was a huge hit! It’s one of the most unique wedding venues you can choose. And part of the fun is revisiting the museum in the following years.

If you want to skip the cookie-cutter hotel ballroom, gaudy catering hall, or are burnt out on barn weddings, this is the place for you.  
  
I just got married over the weekend, and it was everything we had hoped for and more. BG Hacker, who handles all special events for the museum, is the most organized, calming and detail-oriented person I've ever worked with. I am so thankful to have had him working with us every step of the way.  
  
The museum is a clean slate, and really allows you to get as inventive as you'd like with your ceremony and reception. We had a galaxy-inspired wedding complete with twinkling stars, glowing orbs, and cosmic decor. We even made our own mini-movie, which guests got to watch in the Egyptian-themed Tut's Fever theater. The best part is knowing that we can go back to our wedding venue at any time to relive some of the magic.  
  
There was plenty of room for our full buffet dinner and open bar, and it was nice enough outside for guests to enjoy the beautiful outdoor courtyard.  
  
Our guests are still talking about all of the exhibits, especially the custom flip books they made. Where else can you play Donkey Kong, see Freddy Kruger, and voiceover "Babe: Pig in the City"?  
  
As a long-time museum member, and a proud Astoria resident, I'm so glad we chose MOMI as our venue.
