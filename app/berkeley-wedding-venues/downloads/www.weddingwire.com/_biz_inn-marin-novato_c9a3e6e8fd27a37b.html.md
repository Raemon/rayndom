## About

Inn Marin is one of Marin’s best outdoor spaces for ceremonies and receptions. It's Spanish-style buildings cluster around a grand courtyard—a sweeping swath of grass edged by ivy-covered trellises, hydrangeas, palmettos, cypresses, orange trees and a liquid amber that has to be the biggest tree of its kind for miles around. The lawn’s center point is a towering magnolia that, when it’s not sheltering wedding guests, has several “sky chair” hammocks lazily dangling from it. In summer, the high ridge behind Inn Marin blocks the chilly gusts of fog that pour off the Pacific, creating a warm and sunny climatic island. By 3pm, when the sun’s slanting light is a golden wash and the big trees are making velvety shade, the garden becomes almost Edenic, balanced between perfect light and shadow, balmy and cool.  
  
Adjoining the lawn, the Patio Garden and Garden Room are the two primary sites for post-ceremony activities. The Garden Room, which is often used for the cake cutting or for mingling after the wedding reception, looks out through a large bay window and two French doors to the patio, and has an all glass-wall view of Inn Marin’s pool. Large mirrors line the opposite wall, giving the room a spacious feel. The patio, paved with terracotta, is sheltered under umbrellas and another large magnolia. A classic Spanish fountain, water trickling placidly down its sides, formally marks the boundary between the patio and the lawn. The patio is an easy place to set up a bar, a bandstand or a dance floor, allowing guests to enjoy a fine day outdoors long into the evening.  
  
Inn Marin displays a freshness of design and joie de vivre, from its great central courtyard and generous greenery to the big, robustly colored still lifes by the owners’ mother that adorn the walls. Couples often arrive here a day or two early, just so they can settle in and take temporary ownership of this unique, secret garden.

It all began when we stayed at IM (Inn Marin) 2 years ago when we wanted to stay for 2 nights just out of SF, a place with a pool and pet friendly. We were sold! Just off the freeway but wouldn't have known it. Comfortable, motor-lodge style rooms, air conditioned & clean!  
When we got engaged 9/2016 and were beginning our search, I knew IM would be our spot. It was becoming a larger wedding than I anticipated and when we met with the coordinator, Dana Marshall, all of my inhibitions were tamed.   
What a beautiful outdoor wedding we had - perfect weather for September, rooms available for numerous guests (shout out to Terri Rose for coordinating these for us), Rickey's Restaurant (on site) catered both our rehearsal dinner AND wedding! No 2 food appetizers, salads or entrees were the same (I'm in the business and variety and quality are very, very important to me!). Dana was awesome! Her team were awesome, the day was a dream come true! Let Inn Marin & Rickey's take care of you

We loved our wedding at Inn Marin! The day was absolutely perfect. Kelly, the catering director was amazing and helped coordinate everything the day of. They are a one stop shop when it comes to wedding venues. The provide catering, tables, linens, and lighting. The staff was very accommodating and everything looked beautiful. Plus the weather was amazing, which was great because we chose to have the ceremony and reception outside. It was more affordable than lots of venues we looked at too. I'd definitely recommend the Inn Marin.

The staff and coordinator at Inn Marin were so great to work with - they listened to our needs, responded quickly and shared in our excitement the whole way through. They had great ideas and were so open to thinking outside the box so that we could have exactly what we wanted. When our big day came, Kate was attentive and organized and everything went so smoothly. I didn't have to worry about a thing knowing it was in her hands. It was the most perfect, magical day and I have the Inn Marin to thank. I can't recommend this place enough.

Our wedding on August 8, 2015 at Inn Marin was great! Kate was an amazing coordinator that helped me organize the event along the way and on the day of, she was wonderful. We had our wedding ceremony and reception at this location and we were able to use outside vendors, choose specifics that we wanted, and also utilize the organization and logistics that Inn MArin had to offer. The location and coordinator helped us figure out table sizes, flow of the event, delivery times, set up times, flatware, color schemes, linens, decor (basic), lighting, and give us ideas of what would look good in the space they had.   
  
Our wedding was BEYOND what we expected. It was GREAT! And we really felt like everyone had a great time, the food was good, the music was great! and you didn't feel like you were off the side of hwy 101. Initially you would think that its a local Inn or Hotel/Motel but we had plenty of guests stay there and on the contrary, the rooms were very clean, quiet, and theres a resturant on site for cocktails, great dinner, and live music as well!   
  
With Inn Marin we were able to stay within our budget, bring outside vendors in that we specifically wanted for music/food/flowers, and have a day of coordinator (Kate Tuthill) that was AMAZING (at no extra cost).   
  
If you're looking for a Marin venue I would do it again here =)

From start to finish we had great experiences in planning and holding our wedding at The Inn Marin on August 1st. Kate Tuthill, John Marshall & Terri Rose were especially helpful in making all the arrangements and helping in coming up with solutions when any hiccup in our planning arose. We worked mostly with Kate, a wonderful event coordinator who helped keep on track as to what needed to be figured out by when and offered helpful suggestions and ideas that other couples did. She was organized and helped everything run smooth before and during the wedding. It was such a pleasure and she felt like my best friend in the process - the support I realized I very much needed while planning a big wedding of 150 people especially getting close to the day. She kept my spirits up and offered to help with miscellaneous task to help free up my time. She made sure my requests were made and saw everything was followed through that we had talked about. She assured me that all the vendors would have an easy time with the various tasks they needed to do and she communicated with them to make sure all would run smooth.   
  
The day of the wedding, the courtyard was even more beautiful than I had pictured it. Many guests commented on what a perfect and beautiful venue it was. The touches of the gentle sunlight fell through the tree and the overall softness of everything made it feel like a dream. The greenery surrounding the buildings made a beautiful backdrop for our photography.   
  
With regards to pricing, the Inn Marin was quite reasonable and they worked with the menu to make it more affordable for us (and the food was incredible!)   
  
If you have concerns as to the freeway being so close, nobody noticed/heard it during the event.   
  
I highly recommend it!

The Inn Marin is the absolute perfect place for your wedding!   
  
After doing an extensive search of venues within both the Bay Area and the Napa/Sonoma area we were so happy to find the quaint and charming garden setting that the Inn Marin had to offer to us. If you are considering the Inn Marin, you will not be dissappointed!!!!   
  
While the immediate access to the freeway takes you off guard a bit when you first arrive, when you walk through the hotel and into their garden area you feel like you stepped off of the 101 and into a charming oasis! The whole setting looked incredible in photos, especially their fountain and Southern Magnolia tree!   
  
We noticed in our search that many hotels have outrageous fees for miscellaneous items associated with weddings, and we were refreshed to see that the Inn Marin offered very reasonable and affordable pricing, and that they will work with your budget and accommodate your needs so that you really do have what you see as important at your wedding, unlike many vendors that have very structured pricing policies.   
  
The food was incredible, all of our guests raved about their appetizers and dinner. The attentiveness of the staff was nothing short of exceptional. Terri and Kate Tuthill worked night and day to ensure that we were comfortable and made sure that all of our guests had everything they needed. We had several out of town family members staying at the hotel, and they accommodated us as if we were staying in their own home! They even let the remaining guests borrow the hotel barbeque and set tables for them to cook steaks the evening after the wedding!   
  
I wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone looking to have a perfect wedding or other event!

We had our wedding at Inn Marin on 5/9/15. We were extremely happy with the service, the grounds and the food (Big Thank You to the Chef at Rickey's restaurant who does the catering). Kate (the catering coordinator) and John (one of the owners) were wonderful to work with and made sure the vision we had of our wedding became a reality. Our ceremony was set underneath the beautiful magnolia tree, the toast next to the fountain and the reception in the garden room. Each time we see one our guests they make it a point to compliment us on how delicious the food was and on the beautiful location of our wedding.
