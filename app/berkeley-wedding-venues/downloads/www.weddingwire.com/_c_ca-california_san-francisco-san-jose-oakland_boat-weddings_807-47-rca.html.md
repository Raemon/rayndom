I cannot express enough how absolutely thrilled I am with our wedding venue choice. From the moment we stepped foot onto the grounds, I knew it was the place I always envisioned. It has always been my dream to have a ceremony with a breathtaking view, and this venue delivered on every level. The highlight of our wedding day was undoubtedly the stunning sunset that adorned the horizon as we exchanged our vows. It felt like a fairytale come true, and I am forever grateful to the team for making that moment possible. Their attention to detail and dedication to ensuring every aspect of our day was perfect truly made us feel like VIPs. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our needs and preferences. From the initial planning stages to the day of the event, they were professional, friendly, and attentive. They listened to our vision and executed it flawlessly, making the entire planning process a breeze. I cannot recommend this wedding venue enough. It truly exceeded all of our expectations and made our dream wedding a reality. If you are searching for a venue that will take your breath away, provide top-notch service, and make you feel like a VIP, look no further. Trust me, it is worth every penny.

Compass Rose Charters made our wedding very memorable. Most of our guests had never been to the West Coast, so we figured this would be a perfect way for them to experience the Bay Area. Unfortunately the weather was pretty bad on the day of our wedding so we weren't able to go far, but the crew was so much fun that we didn't even notice. They had great appetizers while we were dancing and waiting for dinner and didn't mind that everyone was on the dance floor and singing. Ken was great at coordinating the extra decorations that I brought and making sure things flowed smoothly thoughout the night. Several people even went up to see the captain and thought that was pretty cool. The only thing that wasn't absolutely perfect was that it took a little while for all the plates to come out for dinner. But in the end everyone did get fed (and got some cake) and I'm sure it's not easy serving 30 people dinner from a ship's kitchen. The food was absolutely delicious and there were several menu options. I am a super picky eater (my friends were proud we weren't serving chicken nuggets and pizza) and I managed to find a meal that appealed to me. I would reccommend keeping a wedding on the smaller side if you plan to get married on the yacht. We had about 30 people and it was perfect. It was cozy, but not overcrowded. The reason that I gave a them a 4.5 on responsiveness is because I had a little trouble getting in contact regarding when I could drop of decorations in advance and whether the bridal party and I would be able to board early. They did get back to me well in advance of the wedding though and everything worked out just fine. Also, we got married right around the Christmas holiday and I'm sure that had something to do with it. Everyone had tons of fun at our wedding and I would defintely use them again for another event. Great food, great venue, and great staff!

We had our wedding in May at the GGYC and it was fantastic. This was a such a special venue directly located on the Bay with amazing views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Sausalito, Alcatraz from the dining tables and dance floor and views of the city from the bar and outdoor decks. The venue was kept spotlessly clean and was just the right size for our 95 person wedding. We loved our venue, as did our guests, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique, classy venue with top-notch views.

I was so happy I selected Commodore Cruises for my very small wedding ceremony and dinner celebration. Victoria was professional, responsive and attentive to all the small details throughout the planning and event day. Food selection, preparation and presentation were high end and delicious. Cake was amazing and gluten free! Wait service and bartender onboard the ship were personable and such a pleasure to spend the evening with. Highly recommended selecting Commodore Cruises for a unique and intimate wedding event!

I booked a surprise engagement party on a vessel leaving to/from Tiburon, working closely with Ashley leading up to the event. I have nothing but positive things to say about Ashley & team, everything from planning to day-of logistics went smoothly. All guests had an incredible time sailing past Angel Island, the Golden Gate Bridge, and Sausalito. The bar on- board was great & convenient as well and all the staff members were so friendly. I would absolutely plan another event with Ashley in a heartbeat and if anyone is considering, would highly highly recommend. Thanks to the team for such a special & unforgettable day :)
