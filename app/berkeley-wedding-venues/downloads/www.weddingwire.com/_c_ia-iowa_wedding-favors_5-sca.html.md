Stam Chocolate provided our "wedding cake", which was actually a giant box of cream filled chocolates. These chocolates are not your average waxy, dried out filling, truffles. These chocolates are filled with actual cream (which means they only keep a couple of weeks), and are shipped refrigerated. The price is very fair, considering what you get. The customer service was excellent and answered questions about ingredients when called on a Saturday, emailed me within two business days about another inquiry, and even did a custom order for me with no extra charge or trouble. Highly recommended. A three tiered "cake" of fine chocolates over wedding cake will give your guests something to remember. Or, hand out small boxes of chocolates as favors.

Watermark Corner did our save-the-dates, wedding invitations, programs, gift tags, bar signs, cocktail napkins, and thank you cards. Not only were they so much fun to work with, but the quality of their products is second to none! They listened to all of our wants and worked with us until our items were everything we wanted. We met with them as often as we wanted and they were very responsive when we had questions. I would highly recommend them to anyone wanting one of a kind wedding paper items.

Instead of cake, we decide to go with a popcorn bar and it was awesome! They were able to help me figure out how much I needed. They advised to order it as close to the wedding as possible so it would stay fresh which it did! I ordered 3 flavors and the caramel was the first to be gone! We are actually ordering more caramel just to have at home! Awesome shop!

Humboldt Engraving & Gifts was the perfect place to register for our wedding. They have SO many options of different things to fit everyone’s style.

What's better than a beautifully painted picture of your wedding bouquet that you get to keep forever? Naomi's paintings on glass frames are unique and beautiful.
