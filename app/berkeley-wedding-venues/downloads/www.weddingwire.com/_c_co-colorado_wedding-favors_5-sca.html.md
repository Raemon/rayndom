I highly recommend Ivitalize! I needed a little pick me up before my big day, and I’m so glad I called Ivitalize! Matt was very professional and made sure I was well informed and at ease throughout the experience. I have tiny veins so I’m used to being poked several times before a successful IV. Not with Matt! He got my vein first try with no pain and no digging! I felt revived, refreshed, and relieved that it was such a pain free experience. I will absolutely be using Ivitalize’s services again!

We had Hats by Parker Thomas for our welcome party and it was an absolute hit. People loved being able to customize a hat and wear it all night. Steph and Julia were the life of the party and truly made this experience a 10/10. They were so welcoming to everyone and ensured that everyone got exactly the hat they wanted. From the bottom of my heart, thank you guys for making our night perfect and for giving us something to remember forever!

Kelsea was an absolute dream to work with for our bridal shower! Her talent is unmatched—each watercolor portrait she painted was a stunning, personalized keepsake that our guests couldn't stop raving about. Kelsea’s attention to detail and ability to capture each person's unique essence in such a short amount of time was truly impressive. She arrived promptly, set up quickly, and was completely professional throughout the event. Her warm, friendly demeanor put everyone at ease, and she seamlessly added a special touch to the celebration. I highly recommend Kelsea for any event; she is an incredible artist and a true professional!

We absolutely loved working with T Claire Artwork!! She was so personable, easy to work with, and truly made our day even more special. The painting turned out incredible- we are so in love with it. Our guests couldn’t stop talking about how friendly and engaging she was throughout the night. Everyone enjoyed stopping by to watch her paint and were so impressed by her talent. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience and will cherish this piece of art forever!

Julia is an absolutely gem of an individual! She is so quick to respond to inquiries and her skills put her so far above other wedding painters, it's insane! Many were skeptical about a wedding painter but with Julia, she absolutely blew everyone away on the wedding day. It was the talk of the whole day! People couldn't believe the level of detail and colors she was able to get. Many claimed it was as good as a photograph. The final piece is absolutely stunning. The extra hours in the studio and frame were just icing on the cake. We are so happy with our painting and it hangs in a place of honor on our mantle in our living room. 12/10 would recommend Julia to anyone getting married.

We thought we didn't need a wedding planner...boy were we wrong. We live in NYC and had the wedding at our home in Nederland Colorado. The wedding never would have happened without Rachel. Our wedding was beautiful and perfect. She sent me options and I just picked what I wanted.I barely lifted a finger and was able to relax and enjoy the event. She was very attentive to the timing of the event as a result it flowed naturally. We had some last minute issue that she handled immediately. At the last minute the photographer (a friend of my husbands) cancelled Rachel found us a wonderful alternative photographer. She was also able to find a last minute baby sitter for the 7 children at the wedding. Rachel really went above and beyond the call of duty. She even carried our old dog down the isle to put the finishing touches on the event. The day was magical and Rachel is responsible for making it go off perfectly. We couldn't be more happy.
