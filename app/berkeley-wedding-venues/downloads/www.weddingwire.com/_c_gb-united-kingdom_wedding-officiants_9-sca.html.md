I am so happy we found Gwen. In everything she did, the focus was on us having OUR dream day and making it perfect for US. In many ways we threw away the text book and she took it all in her stride, tailoring her planning specifically to our preferences regardless of how quirky or outlandish they may have seemed. Her focus was always on making it the day we wanted to have and to remember for the rest of our lives and she did exactly that. Our planning for the wedding(s) had to all be done remotely due to work commitments abroad, and it’s fair to say that we had a very ‘vague’ idea about getting married but we really were clueless when it came to the order of events for the ceremony what with having very limited knowledge of weddings in general, but luckily under her guidance this didn’t matter at all! The service she put together was personal, emotional and touching with the right amount of humour to keep everything the heartfelt but light ceremony we were after. We are not exaggerating when I say there was not a dry eye in the house. The rehearsal before the ceremony was challenging due to our not being in the country until a week before the service, but Gwen went out of her way to make it work around us and it proved to be invaluable as it became evident that the entire bridal party needed a bit (of a lot) of instruction on just what they were supposed to be doing. We realised then that there were so many vital logistical issues that we hadn’t even thought of so thank goodness for Gwen! I cannot recommend her highly enough. She kept two potentially hysterical brides calm and comfortable throughout the process and was the anchor that we, and our families needed. I know that is a cliché thing to say but she genuinely did make it an extraordinarily special day.
