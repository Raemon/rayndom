The cookies was absolutely beautiful, with perfectly executed personalized design that really stood out. It's soft texture and balanced sweetness made it a joy to eat, and the lemon flavor was easily my favorite - fresh, bright, and delicious. Overall, it was a wonderful treat and a thoughtful, memorable edition to a special occasion.

Ksenia was an absolute highlight of our wedding! Her incredible talent and beautiful live illustrations left all of our guests in awe. Watching her create such stunning pieces in real time was truly mesmerizing, and she added such a unique and special touch to our big day. Not only is she exceptionally skilled, but she was also so warm and professional, making the entire experience seamless and enjoyable. Our guests couldn’t stop talking about her, and we are so grateful to have these one-of-a-kind works of art to remember our celebration. Highly recommend Ksenia to anyone looking for an unforgettable addition to their event!

We had the pleasure of working with Tina at our recent non-profit fashion show event, and she was nothing short of amazing! Tina created stunning fashion sketches that captivated our guests. She is a delight to work with, and a talented artist. I highly recommend her!!

I have been dreaming of having my wedding painted by Holly since I first met her two years ago. Her work is breathtakingly beautiful. She painted our first kiss, and this painting is a work of art we will cherish forever and get to pass down to our future kids. Not only is her work amazing, Holly is so kind hearted and very easy to work with. It is a pleasure to know her and own a piece of her art.

My clients hired Cigar Stud Events for a wedding welcome party at the Canopy Hotel in West Palm Beach. Before the event, Emily and her team were professional and courteous throughout the planning process. They offered insight and guidance to ensure that we were selecting the appropriate package and add-ons to provide guests with an elevated cigar experience! On the day of the event, our live cigar roller, Williams, arrived early to setup and prepare for guest arrival. He was attentive and engaging with guests throughout the event! The bride, groom, and their family and friends thoroughly enjoyed the experience! I highly recommend Cigar Stud Events! I look forward to working with their team again soon! ~ Ebony Peoples Events & Design

These are a great buy for the money! I went with the 36” length to give everyone time to get their sticks lit and for the couple to be able to make a couple run throughs if needed for photos. The gold color is beautiful! You won’t go wrong with this purchase! These arrived quickly and well packed.

My experience with Florida Candy Buffets was fantastic. I coordinated a donut wall for my sister and brother-in-law's wedding and was impressed with the beautiful display and how delicious the donuts tasted. We ordered Oreo, glazed, Samoa Cookie, and M&M. I loved all four flavors, though Samoa Cookie was the crowd favorite. Communication with Farida via email was easy and I always received a timely response. Other things I appreciated were the friendliness of the employee setting up the wall, the large boxes provided for leftovers, and the flexibility with a requested last minute timing change by the vendor. I definitely recommend this vendor and would use them again if I ever had the opportunity to be involved in the hosting of another party in the Orlando area.
