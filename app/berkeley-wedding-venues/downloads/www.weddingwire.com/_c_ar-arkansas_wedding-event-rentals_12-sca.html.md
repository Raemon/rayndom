Your Main Events went above and beyond when it came to our wedding! We rented tables, chairs, a bar, and a few other things from them that they set up! (We paid for the installation fee.) They also set up some decorations that we had brought, which they didn't have to do! Also, our day didn't go exactly as planned but Your Main Event employees had it handled every step of the way!

Jennifer was amazing to work with. We rented through Simply events for our wedding. Everything was delivered the day before we arrived, so we had plenty of time to set up. She sent us an email letting us know how the items were organized, so it was easy to find everything. She was very accommodating, even with our last minute changes.
