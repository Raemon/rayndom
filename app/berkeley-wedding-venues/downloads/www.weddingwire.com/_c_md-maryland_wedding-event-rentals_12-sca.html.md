We worked with Lori from the start of our planning to get a 150-person tent, and she was extremely accommodating. The team came out two days before the wedding and set everything up in about 6 hours. The tent looked beautiful and made the night so special. Overall I would give the experience a 10/10.

We had an extremely positive experience working with Eastern Shore Tents & Events. We had an outdoor wedding at a private residence and ESTENTs provided us with everything we needed to bring our vision to life. From the tent, lighting, tables, and chairs to the dishes, silverware, and linens, the value and quality of their services were superb. We worked closely with Michelle who was very professional, thorough, answered our many questions, and offered excellent advice and guidance while keeping our budget in mind. We were even invited to tour their showroom and view sample tables, linens, dishes, etc. to help us in making our decisions. We would highly recommend this company!

We couldn’t have asked for a better experience! Renting through Antique Rental Cars was completely hands-off and stress-free—the process was seamless from start to finish. The cars themselves were stunning, and they added such an elegant touch to our wedding décor while doubling as the perfect photo backdrop. Our guests loved them, and they truly elevated the day. Highly recommend for weddings or any special event.

We recently had the pleasure of booking Viking Restrooms for an event for our business and we were very impressed. We wanted our employees and their guests to have a more comfortable place to use the restroom and we were not disappointed. The cleanliness of the restrooms was exceptional and they were well maintained. The staff that we spoke to and met were so friendly and helpful throughout the entire process. We chose Viking because of how easy it was to book with them and could not be happier with our experience. We will definitely be reaching out to them again for future company gatherings.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Weekend Warriors was hands down the most professional and helpful team we could have asked for. We recently hosted a large fundraising event at The Barn at Brambleton, and Charles and his staff were truly extraordinary. We genuinely could not have pulled this event off without them. They were there every step of the way, setup, breakdown, helping with food, and constantly tidying throughout the event, doing absolutely anything we needed without ever being asked. Their attention to detail, positive attitude, and willingness to jump in wherever needed made the entire night run seamlessly. Truly a 5-star experience. I will never host an event without this team again. If you are considering anyone else, stop and just trust Charles and the Weekend Warriors team.

We had a fantastic experience with Gala Cloths! They did the table cloths and napkins for our wedding. Dulany actually made the suggestion of table cloth and napkin colors since she knew our venue and it looked incredible. I never would have thought to go with that color/texture she recommended, but it was perfect. I would definitely recommend them to other brides!

Our wedding was under a tent in a friend's yard, so we were not about to impose on having nearly 100 guests using their bathrooms! Maryland Portable Restrooms was awesome. The only snag was that they were supposed to notify us when they were on their way to install the trailer, and they didn't call till they were in the driveway - a minor difficulty as the house was not occupied at the time. I was able to get there, though, and the delivery person was very flexible that way. He showed me how the trailer could be secured, how to start power, lights, AC and music. Yes, music in the rooms. Our 14' trailer had 3 restrooms - men's, women's, and family. Everyone was amazed at the AC (a very hot day in June) and the cleanliness and comfort of the rooms. Everything was provided - toilet paper, soap, paper towels. The pickup after the event could have been a few hours earlier, but it turned out to work just fine. I have recommended Maryland Portable Restrooms already to my husband's son for his wedding!

The set up for our event (tables, chairs, etc) were beautiful and smooth! We really appreciated the flexibility with the intermittent inclement weather - it made the day so much less stressful.

Because of the impending hurricanes (Irma and Jose), our tent was delivered and raised early to ensure that we would have it in place for our daughter's wedding. Dave was incredibly helpful in giving us the information we needed to make a good decision on size and style of tent and sides. The men raising the tent were courteous and efficient, The office staff was very professional and accommodating of the changes we made to our order.
