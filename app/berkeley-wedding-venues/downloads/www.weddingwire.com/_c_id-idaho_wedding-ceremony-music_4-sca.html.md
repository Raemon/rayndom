I discovered Silhouette Strings through WeddingWire, cross-checked their information on Facebook, and watched a performance video of theirs on YouTube. Impressed by their musical performance, I contacted them regarding a fundraiser party I was organizing. Specifically, I sought a musical ambiance akin to the elegant sound of Bridgerton to complement the atmosphere of our garden party. They arrived punctually, conducted themselves discreetly during setup, and promptly initiated contact with me as the hostess. Their performance was both delightful and precisely aligned with my expectations. They adeptly blended modern tunes with classical execution, captivating our guests with each successive song. Throughout their two-hour performance, they seamlessly transitioned between sets, taking a pre-arranged 10-minute break for refreshments and facilities. Their professionalism and musical finesse were widely praised by our guests, who appreciated the thoughtful selection of songs and the elegance with which they were played. I would highly recommend S.E. and encourage anyone looking for an elegant touch to their party to reach out to them.

The Syringa String Quartet performed at our ceremony and cocktail hour in August, and they sounded amazing. The Quartet has an amazing range of song choices, and we were able to curate the perfect list for our celebration. We also appreciated how communicative they were leading up to the day. Highly recommend!

The minute we approached Heidi about playing for our wedding ceremony, we knew we had to secure her for our event! She is a delight, had timely opinions on important issues that could (and did) come up, which we never considered, and played beautifully. Thank you Heidi!
