I used Wrappers Ink for personalizing wine/champagne labels and also for personalizing chocolate bars for gift giving. The service was exceptional! They were so easy to work with, and they were more than willing to accommodate different styles, sizes and personalization. Labels were professionally completed on time, and the quality was outstanding. The chocolate bars had an excellent flavor and the personalization was perfection. The wrappers on the bars made them look like an expensive "gift" but the value here is superior to any company Ive worked with. Truly a great idea for any event or to use as "gift giving." I highly recommend "Wrappers Ink."

We ordered the wedding chocolate truffles for our favors. I loved the fact they were shaped as three tiered wedding cakes. I ordered a mixture of the dark chocolate, white chocolate and milk chocolate truffles. We were able to choose the color of ribbon and rosette we wanted which went on each truffle. They were worth the money and a big hit!!

We did both our wedding invitations and rehearsal dinner invitations for our Estes Park wedding at Swoozies. They are so easy to work with and have such great ideas. I went in not knowing anything about how to lay out a wedding invitation. They had everything I needed to help create our invitations: font types, all sorts of ways to word things, font/background colors, different designs, etc. Once we had our ideas on paper, the designer sent multiple proofs to me before printing so I could make sure it was exactly what I wanted. I would recommend Swoozies to anyone needing a place to help create the perfect invitations for their special day!!

I was looking for an edible wedding favor, and my wedding planner recommended Louise's Sweets. Tuwanna, the owner, had several options for me to choose from (simple to highly ornate) and we ended up choosing a simple chocolate dipped oreo with mint flavor. The favors were very reasonably priced and were wrapped in a beautiful foil personalized with our names and the wedding date. I was extremely pleased with the favors (they tasted great). I highly recommend Louise's Sweets!
