Great Affordable Wedding Spot

We had our wedding here in June of 2025 and had a great experience. Overall the staff was responsive, helpful, and ensured our day ran smoothly. The bridal suite space was perfect to get ready in and great for photos, and the boys enjoyed the downstairs area with the pool table and Grooms Suite. We had a couple communication blips during the process when Big Dog transferred event coordinators, where some of our agreed upon event asks were forgotten, and some miscommunication occurred with their new standards of doing things that wasn’t made aware to us upon booking, but overall these issues were corrected and we were able to work everything out. Jose was very helpful the day of in setting things up, and helping our coordinator to make sure the vision was achieved. The wind can get verrrryyyy crazy up in the hills, so that was the one thing we did not accommodate for so our floorplan needed to change last minute to accommodate that, and some of our decor ended up not being able to happen due to the crazy wind. Be sure to think ahead about that!   
We appreciated BDV’s flexibility with changing the set up last minute, letting us drop off decor early and leave it over night to get the next day etc. They were very accommodating to our requests, which is always helpful during stressful wedding planning.   
Overall the guests were happy, BDV met every expectation we had agreed upon, and the day went smoothly and as well as it could have! I’d recommend the venue to couples looking for a nice venue with beautiful views, a getting ready area on site, with the ability and freedom to customize your event as you wish.

Amazing wedding experience!

When we began researching for a wedding venue, we prioritized finding a place that gave a "backyard boogie" vibe. Big Dog Vineyard had this vibe, and it's a little-known gem in the Milpitas hills! The view is incredible, overlooking the South Bay Area and the Santa Clara Valley. Staff at Big Dog Vineyard were professional, helpful, and flexible as they accommodated numerous requests and dozens of questions via email, phone, and in-person visits. On the day before the wedding, staff allowed us to drop off some wedding equipment and decorations. We had 235 guests in attendance with another approximately 15 vendor staff members present, including Big Dog Vineyard staff members. There was plenty of parking with both the smaller parking lots and the much larger overfill lot. This number of guests required 24 72-inch round tables, which fit on the front lawn comfortably. We were also able to bring our own food vendors, and Big Dog Vineyard was very accommodating to tailor plans and fit the needs of our food vendors. Staff allowed us to use their refrigerator to store our wedding ice cream cake for a day. The DJ set up shop at the the corner of the front patio near the lawn, and we set up a photobooth inside the house. In the back patio they had nice standing and seating areas for cocktail hour before dinner service and fire pits to stay warm and make s'mores after dinner service! The back patio was also a nice place for guests to hang out if they wanted a break from the loud music in the front lawn.   
  
The skies were clear with a daytime temperature of 85 degrees on our wedding day in early August with a cool, but not cold, low of 59 degrees. There was a moderate breeze during cocktail hour from about 5-6pm that blew a few plates and utensils out of position at their tables, but the wind died down during dinner service around 6:30pm and remained calm in the evening.  
  
Big Dog Vineyard staff was accommodating every step of the way, and they worked with us, our wedding coordinator, all vendors, and our family and friends for an unforgettable afternoon and evening. Many guests were surprised that we found this gem in the Milpitas hills for a wedding reception. If you are in search of a venue that will bring the backyard boogie vibe and the wow factor to your wedding day, we recommend Big Dog Vineyard without reservation!
