Excellent. The grounds were beautiful and Salina was a top-notch coordinator. We did the ceremony on the large wooden deck out front, and the oak trees, beach, and old schoolhouse made a beautiful backdrop. We moved into the lobby of the Performing Arts Center for the reception, which was perfectly intimate but not cramped at all for our small guest list of ~40 people. There are a few things I would have done differently with our wedding but the venue was definitely not one of them! High point: The baker forgot to bring our wedding cakes (yes, really) but that did not phase Salina, who ran to the local grocery and got the prettiest cake she could find for us to cut in front of the crowd and a sheet cake to cut in the kitchen.

Beautiful location. They closed the museum early so we could have full use of the space. Museum personnel did all of the set up and clean up.
