We can't even begin to explain how pleased we were with Chad Midkiff and everyone with Apex Events!! Our World Wedding Production "Sweet Spetember" at the Keith Albee was a night that we, are friends, and family will never forget! People tell us that our wedding was the most fun and well organized event that they had been to in a long time! We have been married for 6 months and still brag about everything that was done for us!! We were in great hands every step of the planning process and wish we could do it all over again!! There was not one thing that we would change about our wedding and the people that helped us put it all together!! We had the wedding that we always wanted and MORE!!!

This DJ was perfect for us. They were very flexible and delivered exactly what we wanted. They were on time and setup without any issues. They were professional the whole evening and kept everyone happy and dancing. We provided them with a Playlist of the songs we wanted played for every part of the reception and they stuck to that list exactly as we had asked. Anytime we or some of our friends need a DJ again we will be calling them.
