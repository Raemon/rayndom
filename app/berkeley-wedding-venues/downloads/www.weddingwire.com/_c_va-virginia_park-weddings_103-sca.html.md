We had our wedding there! Loved the space, they had a lot of options for the cost and are great value for the $$ (at time of writing). Tina was always very responsive and accommodating for when we wanted to visit and look at the space. Only thing is, be prepared to DIY most of your event if you hold it there. They have a list of vendors they like to work with that makes the process easier. It's also off of a windy country road so careful driving is a must!

Was researching in Virginia the best wedding venue, April 2024 and came across this venue. Went to the venue that spring, and literally fell in love with the modernism look but just how beautiful everything was… From the landscape…… To its views… And literally just a venue was clean and modern looking. The team that works, there was amazing to work with. We are gay male couple, and one of the hesitations was just this political climate of being refused services. This venue not only respects us, but made our wedding day perfect. They responded to our communications right away and made everything happen. No complaints at all no feedback for them to improve… Just amazing all around. Worth every penny. Literally the best wedding venue in town… Do not waste your time going to the Jefferson Hotel or Main Street station wedding venue… This is literally the best venue in Virginia. Our wedding was on March 29, 2025.

We have lived in lake of the woods for 15 plus years so having the clubhouse as a venue option was at the top of our list. We’re so glad we did, they just take care of everything for you (venue, setup, food, alcohol) which was a peace of mind, not to mention the view is just amazing. It’s not as expensive if you are a LOW resident but they have it available if you aren’t. They will work with you with your vision and needs, friendly and professional staff

The venue was Awesome, the staff at the Attic was fantastic, the food was great, the parking attendances did a wonderful job with taking care of everyone when we arrived. The wedding was done on the beach behind the Waterman's/Attic and the reception was right after. The ataff and crew were ready and it was amazing!!!!!

My husband and I have a personal connection to Triple C, but that is certainly not necessary to have a wonderful wedding here. We had our ceremony in a quiet corner of a field, our dinner in the dining hall, and our dancing in the pavilion! It is such a fun, open venue for a relaxed wedding. Our guests claimed it was the best wedding location they'd ever been to! The combination of the beautiful setting, extremely competitive pricing, and fun activities available makes Triple C a great place for a wedding.

Beautiful venue for our wedding. Stacy was very responsive to our needs and we loved working with her! The space is flexible and beautiful inside and out. Due to weather, we weren’t able to have our ceremony outside but Stacy and her staff made sure the indoor reception space would be ready despite having only an hour to flip the space from the ceremony setup. She really pitched in to help whenever we needed her. Ample time to decorate the day before is included with rental fee too. Check them out-you won’t be disappointed. Reasonable fee too compared to other venues and you get more included. Huge space in kitchen for caterer too!

Absolutely beautiful views surrounding a super flexible pavilion that could easily be dressed up or dressed down depending on the event. The owners are super flexible and allowed us to decorate as we saw fit which included attaching drapes to the posts, lights to the ceiling, and even give the option to let you rent for an entire weekend for set up and break down. The venue has some of the best views on the lake so the sunset was spectacular! Our family even rented the carousel for our cocktail hour which was such a great ice breaker for everyone and a huge hit with the kids. It’s was the perfect setting for the very best day!

Fairy Stone State Park is the perfect venue for any bride, but especially a bride on a budget! It's super cheap compared to other venues and it's beautiful! Our wedding was perfect.

This venue is beautiful! It's simplistic and historical which gives the option of decorating it as much or little as possible. They provided golf carts the day of our wedding to get down to the church and back up to reception hall. It is a small venue and I do no recommend it if you are planning more than 100 people attending, but it's great for smaller weddings. There is a bride room at the church to hide out in till the ceremony starts. They have a bridal suite and groom's suite with private bathrooms and a bigger getting ready room in the upstairs of the reception building. The layout of the building does make it somewhat difficult to fit more than 6 tables, but they provide maps and setup options to fit as many people as possible, which was incredibly helpful. They try very hard to be available for you to see the venue any time up to your wedding. Obviously they can't do this during weddings, but they were willing any other time. The one downside, that they can't help, is that the new treequest is along the way to the church and there were people there when we were about to start our ceremony. Not a huge deal, as the church is far enough away that you can't hear the people and is you have it in the evening, most of the people will be gone. Definitely just more of a heads up if that's important to you. They don't have anyone there to help setup or clean up, but a person was there till the event was over if we had questions and to make sure the trash was out and buildings were locked up. You get the venue from Friday to Sunday at a very reasonable price. We loved having our wedding here and they many sites for beautiful pictures (like the overlooks).
