Santa Barbara Zoo and Rincon Events are Top Notch

Wow! What more can we say. We had very high expectations for our wedding and Rincon highly exceeded these expectations. The Santa Barbara Zoo is an unbelievable venue - stunningly beautiful arrangement with high attention to detail. Our guests were able to arrive early and explore the Zoo and the giraffe-feeding was a major highlight. Rincon Events (we worked with Kinsey) is a highly-professional wedding coordinator company and catering company. Kinsey made us feel so special, like we were the only wedding she was planning. The day-of coordination was brilliant and executed flawlessly. The food is out-of-this-world good. Highly recommend the churros and the carrot-walnut souffle. You can't go wrong with Rincon and the Santa Barbara Zoo.

Wedding Of My Dreams!!

I recently got married at the Santa Barbara Zoo this past month. And Kinsey, and Marc truly made all our dreams and wishes come true. Myself and my husband book the venue 3 years ago, and at the time we had no idea a global pandemic would delay our plans. But Kinsey and Marc acted quickly to ensure that our dream wedding would still be possible. Kinsey is one of the hardest working people I have ever met, she will go over and beyond to make sure you and your loved ones are well taken care of. Kinsey kept excellent communication with me throughout the planning process and made sure I was aware of every single detail. On the day of my wedding she was there by my side throughout the whole day with the big smile on her face. She was quick to help me and y husband in anyway needed, and made sure we were fed as well. She made us feel at ease and moments walking down the aisle it brought me great courage to look at her and hear her say "you got this", "you look stunning". I give my most highest recommendation to the Rincon team for their customer service and delicious food. Thank you for making our day so special and a memorable one for all our family and friends. I will forever think back on this day and smile

Unforgettable wedding at SB Zoo

We got married at the SB Zoo in August 2019. I cannot say enough good things about Rincon. We got so many compliments on the food and amazing service. I'd also like to shout out Angie Chaves who was our event coordinator at the Zoo. She was so helpful and easy to work with during the whole process. During our wedding, she kept us on time and everything was on point!

Dream wedding

We had our wedding at the Santa Barbara Zoo last month and wow, it was a total DREAM. No bridezillas, no groomzillas, no stress, just pure joy. Angie Chaves was our coordinator and she is hands down the best person you could have overseeing the most important day of your life. She is responsive, she remembers everything, she goes out of her way to make everything you want come true. And she does all of this with kindness and humor. Being a bride is stressful and Angie puts all of your stresses to ease. She makes everything easy! Honestly who could ask for more!? Not only will you have the most turnkey experience planning at the zoo (they have almost everything you need to have an event here and they've done it a million times so they KNOW what they're doing) but the Sb Zoo is not your normal zoo, it is one of the most gorgeous places you can get married at in SB. All of our guests commented on the greenery and how lush it was. You can see the mountains and the ocean! And come on, you can have ANIMALS at your wedding!?? Flamingos, birds, giraffes?? Perfect place. Our guests raved about the whole experience and how unique it was. To top it off a portion of what you spend on your wedding here goes to support wildlife conservation and education. Get married and also do good!   
  
Best day ever. Thank you Angie for keeping everyone on time, worrying about all of the big (and small!) things and making sure we had the perfect day!!!!

A wonderful venue for our wedding

This venue is absolutely awesome. The scenery and views made for some incredible photographs, and being able to enjoy the animals was an added bonus. We worked with Events by Rincon and they did an amazing job working with us to take our vision from merely ideas to reality. They let us choose from a lovely selection of items for our menu, which was well received by our guests. The servers and bartenders were very welcoming and friendly and went above and beyond to ensure that all our guests left with full bellies and smiles on their faces. A huge thank you to Angie for making it all possible, she did an amazing job and we were beyond blessed to have her help us coordinate our day!

Amazing and professional

Honestly we could have been married almost anywhere but the staff is what really sold me and their level of professionalism allowed me to put my trust in them for our big day. I received an overwhelming amount of feedback from my guests on the level of care and attention to detail the staff had on all the elements of our venue. Angie was truly the best- she was on it!

Guests had their doubts, and then they showed up!

When we told people we were getting married at the zoo, we got some funny looks. But it's so much more than a zoo. The beautiful grounds, the amazing views, and stellar staff (they work exclusively with Events by Rincon for coordinating and catering) are the stuff of perfect weddings. And mine was (not just my words...) The access to animals was an added bonus that we and our guests will remember forever. It's really a no brainer--you get the best of both worlds: an interesting and unique and beautiful venue with the extensive experience of a supporting staff and an amazing catering and rental team. They were a dream to work with and made the planning process incredibly easy.

Beautiful zoo property

The zoo is absolutely beautiful and a great venue for a wedding. The animals offer and unique and intimate atmosphere. We decided on a different venue but would highly recommend the zoo for larger parties

Highly recommended

We had an amazing wedding at the SB Zoo. Everything went flawlessly the day of, and planning was such a breeze, even though we were planning from out of town. Everyone was such a pleasure to work with. All our wedding guests commented how delicious the food was, and how the zoo felt like a tropical destination wedding with the beautiful palm tree foliage and the ocean right across the street. The zoo was such a unique wedding experience with the giraffe feeding as well. We are so happy with everything!

The Zoo is not what typically would come to mind as an awesome wedding venue, but the Santa Barbara Zoo is absolutely GORGEOUS and a perfect venue for ANYONE wanting an outdoor garden wedding - whether you like animals or not! The grounds are stunning, and as a Photographer, it is truly a pleasure to photograph there as there are endless locations to use!!! It's one of my top venues in all of SB for sure!!!
