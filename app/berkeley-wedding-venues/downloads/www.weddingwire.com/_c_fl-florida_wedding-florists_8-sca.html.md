My daughter and I knew from the first phone call with April that she was the florist for us. She was easy to talk to, extremely responsive and has a wealth of knowledge in the floral department. She listened to our floral needs as well as our budget range and continued to assess our needs throughout the entire planning process. April Flowers brought to life my daughter’s vision of her perfect day and created the most beautiful tabletop garden scene. Took our breaths away! I highly recommend calling April and see for yourselves!

From the consultation to the execution, everything was flawless. I was treated like a VIP at every turn. Carlos and his design team are unbelievably talented, extremely patient, and trustworthy. Great price, amazing design. Tens across the board. Seriously, you will not find a Flower Shop like La Maison des Fleurs anywhere in the southern United States like this florist.

Carlos exceeded all of our expectations and brought our wedding vision to life. He not only used decorations provided by our venue but incorporated his own personal touch. We went with a Beauty & the Beast theme for our wedding. Carlos took this to heart by creating enchanted personalized rose domes, draping the farmhouse tables with blue linens, and delicate placement of gold silverware. He took well documented notes and gave us his honest opinion when we were stuck in between multiple choices. His selections were very well thought out and elevated our wedding. He made various flower arrangements full of roses and beautiful callalillys for all our table centerpieces. He also made exquisite flower arrangements for our ceremony site, decorated the secluded swing set for pictures, brought to life large bouquets, and made flower crowns for the flower girls. We had multiple photo shoot spots and the flowers were able to be disconnected and setup at the various sites to save us time. He even went as far as making a wreath for our horse, Jackson. He met us multiple times throughout our venue visits and was patient in helping us bring together all the details involved in decorating a wedding. Our wedding day was just flawless with his help.

I was having a very difficult time finding affordable flowers for my wedding and took a chance on global rose! All the flowers came in perfect condition and perked up with a little bit of water. I would recommend to any bride that is getting married soon and is wanting to DIY your own wedding florals!

I am over the moon about how my wedding flowers from Floral Fantasy turned out. Floral Fantasy was recommended to us by many of our other vendors in the Keys, and we are so happy that we chose them for our wedding flowers. Kellen took some very general inspiration photos and colors and turned them into such beautiful combinations. They turned out so much better than I ever imagined. She was very communicative throughout the entire process, giving recommendations and being open to changes and additions along the way. They were very easy to work with, even letting me come down and see a mock up bouquet about a month before the wedding. Very grateful that we found Floral Fantasy!

I used Oneco for my wedding and they were just amazing. I worked with Kathy who was awesome. I provided her with pinterest photos of what I wanted and she brought it to life. She was very detail oriented and had great communication with me. Not to mention the flowers were so beautiful. I absolutely loved my bouquet, the flowers for the ceremony and reception, and the arch they provided with the draping. Kathy also helped me with ideas to repurpose my flowers from ceremony to reception. I highly recommend!

The Greenery team was fantastic to work with. Our floral coordinator, Shannon, came up with some fantastic ideas and was able to quickly and easily accommodate our modifications. The flowers and centerpieces were top quality and gorgeous. They really added to the beauty of the day.

As we ran our annual Turkey Trot we decided we wanted to get eloped in our favorite city, on our favorite beach, on New Years Eve. We never wanted a huge wedding. We simply wanted an intimate ceremony, somewhere warm. Then we would celebrate with all of our loved ones later on. Beneva Weddings staff was phenomenal. They made all of our dreams come true, ever so quickly. It was the best experience and so easy. We didn’t have to worry about a thing once we were down there. Our officiant, Chris, was perfect! It was like she knew us for years. You would have never known we had just talked over the phone and met each other that morning. They put together the most beautiful ceremony that captured who we are and was so natural. The photographer they brought in to take a couple photos of us during the whole thing did a wonderful job.

We were absolutely blown away by the floral arrangements for our ceremony and reception! Everything looked even more beautiful than I had imagined. The flowers were so stunning, fresh, bright and perfectly arranged that guests actually thought they were fake—until they touched or smelled them! We've received so, so many compliments, and I truly can't thank this team enough for bringing my vision to life. Their work made our day incredibly gorgeous and unforgettable. Cant recommend them enough!!!!!
