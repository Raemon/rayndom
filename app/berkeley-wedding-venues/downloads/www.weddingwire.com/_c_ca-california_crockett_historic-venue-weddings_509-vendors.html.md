Beautiful venue for a wedding and reception! Gorgeous gardens, large deck area, access to indoor areas of a lovely historic home. At night, the outdoor cafe string lights make for a beautiful ambience. I acted as wedding coordinator for a family member's recent wedding, and Tracy, the venue coordinator for The Old Homestead, was a dream to work with! Super friendly and helpful...having her there during the event was like having a friend there to make sure everything went well. This place is a hidden gem...highly recommend!
