The staff were wonderful to work with. April was always prompt with responses to calls and emails. All the spaces were clean and ready for us as soon as we arrived. We had planned to have the reception outdoors but with a chance of storms in the forecast we made the call the afternoon before to move everything inside. With a backup plan already in place, everything went smoothly! This venue is gorgeous and all our photos turned out amazing!! We couldn't be happier with how our wedding turned out and are so happy to have been able to celebrate our day here.

Setting an appointment via email was easy and they allowed us to venture around on our own. They sent a quote within an hour of requesting it. I'm still waiting to book but the Thanksgiving holiday made responsiveness a little slower. The only downside is you must use their caterer which does up the price. Overall, I can't wait to have our wedding there with the fishes! :)

We rented the museum out for our rehearsal dinner and had the event in the main museum area. They were very accommodating to us. We asked them to play some music they had on hand during the event. They showed the children all the places they could go. The children loved being un-inhibited (several parents commented to me how great the facilities were); they had the opportunity to interact with their environment, as opposed to having to be appropriately behaved at a restaurant. The staff kept the simulator area open; part of the bridal party were pilots who helped the kids (and adults) learn how to fly. We would highly recommend them for your event as well.

We had such a fun and great wedding here! We booked the Lotus Pavilion Sanctuary Asia for both our rehearsal dinner and the wedding venue. We were looking for a space where we could have a more casual vibe that was not a barn (the venue is all purpose you could easily make it as fancy as desired). They do require that you use their catering and bartending services (Salt & Surrey Catering) which was great for us as we liked the idea of having less vendor(s) to decide on. The food and drinks were awesome, we did a plated dinner for the rehearsal and we ran like 30 minutes past when we asked the food to be served and they still somehow had managed to keep it warm without overcooking anything. For the wedding itself we ended up having them create a custom menu for us and the catering manager, Taylor, was always very prompt at answering our questions and giving us suggestions. Portions were great for the price and we got so many compliments from our guests on how great the food was! We also opted to have animal ambassadors at our wedding with their keepers during cocktail hour and this was such a great hit. They offer a ton of other cool animal and behind the scenes experiences you can do with your guests but we didn't want to eat up too much of our time so the animal ambassadors were perfect. Probably the biggest downside we had with having the venue here you do have some limitations with setup times (the zoo does need to operate to the public for its normal business hours) but we found that the venue itself is very beautiful on its own and did not need a ton of decorations to make it look great. Thanks Allison and Taylor for making it such an awesome event for us!

We used the MOA as our ceremony and reception location, and we couldn't have been happier with how everything turned out. It was absolutely wonderful. Everything from the staff, to the catering, to the bar, the venue, the photo opportunities there.... it was just PERFECT! We received so many compliments. Staff: Elizabeth was our main contact at the museum. She handles all of the events they host there. She had lots of great ideas, guided us through the process of hosting a wedding/event there, and was quick to respond anytime we had a question. She is kind, thoughtful, accommodating, professional, and seriously awesome at her job. Security: You have to hire the museums security for your event, for obvious reasons. The price was absolutely reasonable. Food: The Cafe at the museum is the exclusive caterer for events at the museum, and this is a GREAT thing. Their food is terrific!! We received SO many compliments on the food. They also did the open bar for our wedding. We did a "consumption bar" at the recommendation of Elizabeth, and the price was much cheaper that way. It was really very reasonable. They have a great selection and did an outstanding job. The food was seriously amazing. Venue: We held our ceremony and reception in the lobby because it was July, and way too hot to do the rooftop. It was beautiful. It held about 70 people if I remember correctly. We also opened up the Chihuly gallery for our guests to go through during the reception, and everyone just thought that was the coolest thing! It was the perfect thing for them to do for the 20-30 minutes immediately following the ceremony while the space was "flipped" and we took pictures and the food was getting set up. We made arrangements to have our photos taken on the rooftop as well, and I am so glad we did that. They turned out absolutely gorgeous and are so unique! We also took photos in the Chihuly gallery and those are super cool as well. Thank you again MOA!!!!
