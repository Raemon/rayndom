## How much does a wedding dress cost?

Buying a wedding dress is unlike purchasing a piece of everyday attire. You’re going to be wearing this dress on one of the most important days of your life, and so you’ll likely spend quite a bit of money on your [wedding dress](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/dresses). While wedding dress prices do vary greatly, the average wedding dress cost in the U.S. is $1,000. It typically ranges from $280 to $1,650, but you can purchase a wedding dress for far above and below those prices.

  * __ $ 30 or less Lower range
  * __ $ 400  Average cost
  * __ $ 125 - $ 1,118  Most couples spend between
  * __ $ 2,013 or more Upper range



Costs displayed are based on spend from thousands of couples who recently reported pricing for this service within their WeddingWire review. Pricing varies based on factors including, but not limited to, vendor’s experience, level of expertise, event guest count, date, and geographic region.

What impacts wedding dress prices?

__

There are a few factors that will impact your wedding dress cost. Most notably, an extremely detailed wedding dress with lots of beading and pricey fabric (silk, etc.) will cost more than a simpler wedding dress, as more intricate gowns require more labor and materials. So a [grand ball gown](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/dresses/ball-gown) with beading and detailed embroidery will cost more than a plainer [sheath dress](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/dresses/sheath). Also, if you’re set on wearing a wedding dress by a famous dress designer, know that it will likely cost more. 

What additional wedding dress costs should a bride plan for?

__

There are several additional costs that brides should factor into their wedding dress cost and budget. These include:

  * Alterations: If you want to drastically change your wedding dress, your alterations may end up costing more than your actual wedding dress!
  * Undergarments and accessories: Be sure to factor in your accessories— [bridal undergarments](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-shop-for-wedding-undergarments), shoes, and more. These accessories will greatly affect how your gown looks and fits, so don’t forget to include them in your wedding dress cost.
  * Cleaning and preservation: Don’t be surprised if you’re still spending money on your wedding dress after your wedding! Whether you plan on wearing your wedding dress again, passing it on to a future generation, or none of the above, it’s still a good idea to have your gown professionally cleaned and preserved. Wedding dress cleaning and preservation can cost $200 or more.



How can you save money on a wedding dress?

__

Yes, a bride’s wedding dress will cost a lot of money—probably more than you’ll spend on another piece of attire in your life! However, there are several ways to [save money on your wedding dress](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/save-money-on-a-wedding-dress) while still finding a gown that you absolutely love.

  * Don’t try on dresses that are over-budget: Be upfront with your bridal salon consultant about your budgets—and be sure ask about the cost of each dress you try on. Avoid the temptation of trying on a wedding dress that’s out of your price range.
  * Find a simple wedding dress, and accessorize: As mentioned, a simple and relatively unadorned wedding gown will cost less than an extremely detailed wedding dress. If you’re on a tight wedding dress budget, we recommend finding a simple gown and using a beaded sash or a brooch to give it some extra sparkle.
  * Find a dress you love as is: Any significant alterations or customizations that you do to a wedding dress will cost (a lot of!) money. Therefore, if you want to make significant changes to a wedding dress (add sleeves, change the silhouette, etc.), that gown is probably not for you. Look for a wedding dress that you love mostly as it looks off the hanger.
  * Scour sample sales: Many bridal salons offer sample sales where they sell sample dresses from past seasons. These sample dresses are typically in sizes 6 to 12, so if you fall in that size category, you may find a gorgeous gown at a low price at one of these sales.
  * Visit trunk shows: If you’re set on purchasing a gown by a specific designer, you might find a deal at a trunk show. Trunk shows are when a bridal salon features the collection of a particular dress designer—and usually offers a discount (usually about 5 or 10 percent off that designer’s wedding dress prices). Research which salons in your area carry your favorite designers, and check their websites for upcoming trunk shows.
  * Give yourself time to shop: A wedding dress can take several months to arrive after you’ve ordered it. Be sure to [start shopping for your wedding dress as soon as possible](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/why-you-must-shop-for-your-wedding-dress-early) —many brides shop at least nine months in advance, if not more. If you wait until the last minute, you may end up paying rush charges for your dress, which can greatly add to your total wedding dress cost.



How much does it cost to alter a wedding dress?

__

[Wedding dress alterations](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/tips-for-wedding-dress-alterations-fittings) can be expensive—particularly if you’re planning on making major changes to your wedding dress. Some bridal salons offer wedding dress alterations in-house. If yours does not, you will likely have to find a tailor who specializes in wedding dresses (be sure to read online reviews of wedding dress tailors before hiring). You’ll typically schedule your wedding dress fittings for at least three months before your big day—so plan accordingly. 76 percent of bridal salons charge alterations by piece rather than a flat fee, so the average cost of dress alterations can vary widely depending on the extent of the alterations. Simply adjusting a hemline won’t cost a ton, but adding sleeves or reworking a bodice will! 

What questions should you ask a wedding dress tailor?

__

When choosing a wedding dress tailor, there are several questions you should ask:

  * How many fitting appointments will I need? How long will the process take?
  * What types of alterations do you recommend for my wedding dress?
  * Have you worked with a dress and fabric like mine before?
  * Can you provide a cost for my alterations?
  * How will you store my wedding dress?
  * What do I need to bring to my first fitting appointment?

After my 2023 wedding, I knew I wanted to preserve my dress but procrastinated. I found Elegance Preserved through multiple social media postings and was able to arrange pick up for my dress towards the end of June 2025. I received an itemized quote within 48hrs of pickup and they were very communicative via text message throughout the whole process. Overall very happy with the service received (completed end of Oct 2025) and am very glad that my gown (Essense of Australia, Style D3314) is no longer taking up a ton of closet space. I’d recommend them to other brides looking for a dress preservation service!

Marina did an absolutely beautiful job tailoring my wedding dress to fit me perfectly. I cannot recommend her enough. My dress had multiple parts to it, including several layers of tulle, delicate lace, and a bolero. The dress was hemmed to fit my height at 5'2, which involved hemming the dress from the waist to avoid removing the beautiful floral lace design at the bottom of the dress. Marina amazingly removed and then resewed the lace at the waistline, and I could not even tell that the lace was resewn. In addition to hemming the dress, Marina also added a 5-point bustle that allowed me to easily move and dance in my dress all night after the ceremony. My cousin, who bustled my dress the day of, said this was the easiest dress she had ever bustled. Marina also did some adjustments to the bust area of my dress and replaced the thin spaghetti straps that originally came with my dress with a set of floral lace straps that were much more supportive and beautiful. And lastly, Marina also tailored the bolero to fit me perfectly! The bolero was made of extremely thin and delicate lace fabric, and Marina did a phenomenal job tailoring it to fit my frame. If you are looking for someone to alter your wedding dress, Marina and her team at Le Caprice will do an amazing job. I would not trust anyone else to work with my dress. Thank you, Marina!

J'aime Bridal was the first shop my wife walked into for her wedding dress, and the only one she needed. She expected to go to multiple shops for a very particular style, but the three associates she worked over multiple visits nudged her into trying multiple styles and cuts, and she ended up picking one she wouldn't have otherwise tried and absolutely loved. The shop's recommended tailor (Tamara) also did a fantastic job.

I can't say enough about this shop... it is the cutest place around - hands down! In the heart of the cutest town ever (Los Gatos), Bride and Bustle stands out like a glowing slice of bridal heaven! The inventory is massive for the space they have, and there is something for everyone! and if the store doesn't do enough just by existing, the girls who work here could not be better. They are truly bridal experts and answered every question i ever had, and tryuly made me feel like a lifelong friend, rather than a customer. THye put 0 pressure, and focus on finding you the dress of your dreams, not just selling like I experienced at so many other shops. I found my gown here and I couldn't be happier!! I 10000% recommend any bride-to-be comes here. They will not disappoint!!

Papers and Petals was the fourth and final store I visited looking for my wedding dress and our experience here was the perfect ending for my search! I booked an appointment last minute and I'm so lucky I got to work with Melinda! She was attentive, knowledgeable, relatable, and set such a comfortable, fun vibe! Melinda really listened to my concerns and things I was looking for in a dress. She was also very helpful in telling us what could be altered and reassuring any doubts or hesitations I had. I'm so happy I said yes to my dress here! (Even more excited that I picked a Randy dress!!!) The store itself is very clean, elegant, and refreshing. I wish I had come here in the first place!

I originally visited Janene's Alameda location to try on dresses, and while I found some real stunners, I couldn't bring myself to pay the price. I ended up going with an off the rack dress from another store who promised the alterations needed were doable. Turns out they weren't and the dress was a disaster....and my wedding was three weeks away! After leaving my fitting in tears, I ran to Janene's off the rack location in SF. I walked in asking for a specific style and they had it and the price was perfect! Since it was off the rack, it of course needed some alterations, but the SF team worked with the Alameda team and I drove there THAT DAY for my first fitting. In less than three weeks, over the course of a couple fittings, they worked a miracle! It honestly brings me to tears just thinking about how they turned an awful situation with another store into my dream wedding dressing in such a short period of time. I am forever grateful to the entire team at Janene's for ALL they did to save my wedding! I cannot recommend them enough!
