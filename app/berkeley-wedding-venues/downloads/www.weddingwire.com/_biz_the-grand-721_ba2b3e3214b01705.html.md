Amazing Venue! 

Where do we even begin?! We hosted our wedding at the Grand OL Barn on July 1, 2023 with approximately 145 people. We booked one of the Barb’s All Inclusive packages and the value for the money was amazing! It was truly our fairytale wedding! Regan, our event planner, was amazing to work with both prior to the wedding and especially the night of. She was always quick to communicate during the planning stages. I also worked with Lyric from Catering and she was so responsive and on it- we added some new items the barn hasn’t done before (Mix your own Martini station with an ice luge and Oyster bar) and they knocked it out of the park! All of our guests RAVED about the food and offerings!   
  
The barn offered us the perfect setting to make our fairytale wedding come to life and it more than delivered! Having the flexibility of the spaces let us host a completely air conditioned wedding from ceremony to reception in unique spaces and kept our guests cool (important in Florida in July!!). I couldn’t recommend the Barn more. Amazing venue, amazing staff, and a fantastic facility with the ability to truly make it unique to you.

We LOVED The Grand 721!

We had our wedding at The Grand 721 last month! I looked at probably 50+ venues and knew the moment I saw this one that it was the one! It is stunning! I love that they have the option for outdoor or indoor ceremony. The indoor white chapel was exactly what I envisioned for my wedding and the ballroom with the beautiful drapes. I was sold on this place just by how beautiful it is, but to top it off it includes so much decor, tables and chairs that would usually be an extra cost! Plus, any decor you use of theirs they set it up and take it down!  
They also have an in-house caterer that relieves the stress of having to coordinate dinner with a vendor.  
Any questions I had, they responded very quick!  
Hannah, their wedding coordinator, is also so helpful and amazing! I highly recommend hiring her as your wedding coordinator.  
I’m so happy we chose to have it here! It was such a special, beautiful day!

Amazing Venue and Staff! 

My husband and I got married there on 7/6/24 and truly had the most magical wedding! Hannah and the staff were INCREDIBLE, they kept us organized all day and we truly felt like a king and queen. The venue is gorgeous and cannot recommend this venue and overall experience enough. To quote my father, “that is a wedding that we will never forgot and I am proud it was my daughters”. Thank you Hannah and the Grand 721 staff!

Amazing Wedding Venue

I had my wedding here about a week ago. From the moment my husband and I viewed the venue, we knew it was the one. We wanted a barn feel and the set up and rustic decor was better than expected. Staffed had a quick response when there were questions and were there for us every step of the way. I'm a procrastinator and it really didn't hit me how fast everything was happening until we were 5 weeks out. The staff Carolina, Hanna, Lyric, and the Chef were there and helped every step of the way. Carolina the wedding coordinator was amazing. Created our timeline and kept everything organized and on track. Hanna helped my thoughts come alive for how we dreamed for our wedding to look. The food was amazing, all of the family loved it. Carolina was by myside (or a text away) the whole time on wedding day. When she noticed we needed anything she was right there reducing stress and keeping things organized. I would have been a mess without her. I would recommend this place for other couples looking to get married. The bride suite and grooms suite were roomy and comfortable, the a/c works great, and all together just a beautiful place. Thank you all for making our special day more special!

A+ Staff at Grand 721 Venue

I just got married at The Grand 721 Venue last weekend. I cannot say enough about the staff helping me through my wedding. My souse and I live out of state and chose the all-inclusive black & white package, had ~160 guests at my wedding, and worked closely with Carolina (Wedding Coordinator), Hannah (Venue Manager), Lyric (Catering Manager), and Mia (Venue Florist) at this venue.  
  
I can not say enough how competent, professional, customer-oriented and flexible this team was. They worked together, they helped us coordinate with all of the multiple vendors that were a part of the package, were absolutely wonderful to work with every step of the way, were communicative and accessible, and embodied true hospitality and joy. I have organized and been a part of numerous weddings and events, and this team was TOP - NOTCH and ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE to work with.  
  
The fact that catering and florals were part of the venue team was a huge help.  
  
VENDORS FOR ALL-INCLUSIVE PACKAGE:  
One one hand, as someone who lives out of state, I appreciated having the vendors selected to work with as part of the all-inclusive package. It helped me dive right into planning the wedding. On the other hand, I would have also liked having several options of vendors to choose from as part of the package. I would have liked to compare at least a few different vendors to see what other companies had to offer.  
  
\- R&M Cakes = was excellent to work with.  
\- DJ Complete = I would say are more emcees than DJs but if you know what music you want played, they will play it, bring great energy, and professional.  
\- Gloss Beauty Bar = were good stylists, but very slow in their communication and only communicate via email  
  
THE VENUE ITSELF:  
The venue does not have curb appeal, but is beautiful and as accurate as its pictures on the inside. The reception hall was extremely comfortable, clean, well lit, and spacious. Parking valet is not an option at this venue. The venue has plenty of bathrooms, which was important for us for our guests. They had plenty of bars and bartender options.  
  
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:  
They had recommendations of other businesses to work with to help us manage guest experiences, and their lighting and decor options matched the venue perfectly. We would have preferred louder speakers, but this is something to coordinate with the DJ company.  
  
SPECIAL RECOGNITION:  
A HUGE shout-out to Carolina (Wedding Coordinator) and Hannah (Venue Manager) who were the two personnel I worked closest with throughout the last several months. I can not say enough about these two professionals. There is no way that things would have been as beautiful and well-organized without them. Thank you!!

Mink Wedding

This venue is a one stop shop!!!! We loved it. We recently had our wedding 2/18 and booked this venue do to the fact they made the process so easy. We decided to go with there catering team and day of coordinator. Best decision we could of made. The day of the wedding the decor was everything we expected and more. The food and the service was incredible our guest was very impressed and taste buds satisfied. Hannah and Carol were a big stress reliever for me on the day of keeping everything on track. Making sure I the bride had everything I needed looked my best at all times, that day was suppose to be a stressful day I thought but those two ladies were on top of everything and made it so I would be able to enjoy my day from start to end.  
I would definitely recommend this venue and all the services it provides
