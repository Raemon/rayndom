Best DJ for weddings!!

Jeremy was absolutely amazing. He was very fast to respond and super flexible even with last minute changes. His music was exactly what we wanted and he got all of our guest out on the floor dancing. I would recommend him to anyone needing a Dj for their big day!

Best DJ ever! Highly recommend!

DJ Krick was very proffesional and met with us before our reception to go over everything in person. We were not from the area and he made us feel super confident everything would go smooth and it did! He was so much fun and such an awesome DJ! I highly recommend him and you won't be dissapointed.
