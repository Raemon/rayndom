## About this vendor

__

No photo yet

No owner details yet.

__8 years in business

I create floral designs that are inspired by nature, emotion, and the unique love story behind each couple I work with. My signature style features lush, elegant blooms arranged with care, depth, and softness to bring warmth, color, and personality to every celebration. I believe flowers should feel alive and expressive—whether romantic garden-style bouquets, modern artistic arrangements, or timeless classic designs.

One of the things that makes my work unique is that we import and export our flowers directly from the farms. This means every bloom is fresher, fuller, and truly vibrant. It also allows me to work with a wide range of budgets without compromising quality or beauty. I take time to listen closely to your vision, understand your priorities, and create floral pieces that feel meaningful, personal, and unforgettable.

Every wedding is crafted intentionally—from the very first inspiration board to the finishing touches on your wedding day—so your flowers don’t just decorate the space, they tell your story.

Ambar Flower Gift & Shop is based in Miami, Florida, and provides wedding floristry services.

Wedding 2025

We booked with Lorena for my sister and brother in law’s wedding in March earlier this year. Lorena was so cooperative and brought the vision to life better than we could have imagined. She was super communicative and made sure we were comfortable with any suggestions she made. She made suggestions that immensely improved our initial ideas. She was also so professional with her communication to me and whenever there might’ve even been the slightest chance of misunderstanding, Lorena would ensure we were on the same page before moving forward. I would 1000% book Lorena again in the future!!!
