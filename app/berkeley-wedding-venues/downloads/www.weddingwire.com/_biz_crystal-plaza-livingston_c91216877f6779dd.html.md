Booking our wedding at the Crystal Plaza was the best decision we ever made!

Booking our wedding at the Crystal Plaza was the best decision we ever made! From the moment we first walked in the door, we were greeted by Max Janoff like we were family - we immediately felt right at home and knew that we had just found our dream venue. By the time we first toured Crystal Plaza, we had already toured quite a few venues (8+) but Crystal Plaza was unlike anything we had seen at the other venues in North Jersey.   
  
The venue itself is absolutely stunning. From the chandeliers, to the cocktail hour space, to the ballroom, to the gardens, to the atrium, to the penthouse bridal suite, to the groomsmen’s vault - every space is beyond gorgeous and distinctly unique. However, what stood out even more to me was the incredible service and staff.   
  
Truthfully, the decision was easy (as it should be)!  
  
Leading up to the big day, Max and his team were very responsive via email (which was so important to us). Their answers to our questions were always helpful and honest. We were so confident that Max and his team would perfectly execute our dream day because they were so detail-oriented and provided us with great feedback based on their personal experiences.   
  
After the wedding, we asked many of our guests - what are the top things that stood out? The answers were pretty consistent - the service, the food, and Max. These are the best answers that we could hope for. We have had MULTIPLE guests tell us this was one of the best weddings they’ve ever attended.  
  
Our wedding day at the Crystal Plaza was one of the best days of our lives, and it’s all thanks to Max and his team. Do yourself a favor and book asap!!

As an Industry Insider, I Couldn’t Have Chosen a Better Venue

It’s no secret that Crystal Plaza is a stunning venue with incredible spaces — but what truly sets it apart is the hospitality. Being in the wedding industry myself, I had worked at Crystal Plaza before and had seen firsthand how thoughtfully they treat their couples. I knew I wanted to be somewhere I could completely trust, and from the very first tour, the team at Crystal Plaza made the process fun, organized, and entirely stress-free.  
  
Our first tour was with Max Janoff, who is so kind, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about what he does. He immediately made us feel at ease and excited about our day. Later, during our final details call, Max went above and beyond — offering thoughtful suggestions and creative ideas to elevate our experience even further.  
  
Expectations were clear from the start, and the entire team was beyond responsive to every question along the way. When it came to our wedding day, I was on cloud nine. Liza and G were practically mind readers — they took care of us and our parents with such warmth and attention to detail. I didn’t have to think about a single thing because they made sure everything was handled perfectly — from ensuring I always had something to eat and drink, to keeping my comfy shoes within reach.  
  
Crystal Plaza doesn’t just host weddings — they create an experience filled with care, joy, and ease. I can’t recommend them enough!

The Venue of Our Dreams

When we first toured this venue we knew instantly that this was where we would be getting married! Every inch of Crystal Plaza is absolutely stunning and the entire staff went above and beyond our expectations. Our point of contact was Iris, who was fantastic to work with and always made sure we had everything we needed. From our initial meeting to the day of the wedding, communication was consistent and smooth and everyone on the Crystal Plaza team was always available to answer our questions. Words can’t describe how incredibly grateful we are to this venue and its team for making our day so special. It was a truly magical day that we will always remember!

Highly Recommend 

I cannot being to express my gratitude towards Max, The Janoff family, and the entire Crystal Plaza team. My wife and I got married at the Crystal Plaza on 5/2/25 and definitely had high expectations. The entire staff at the Crystal Plaza beyond blew away all of them.  
  
During the planning process, Max helped guide and create the exact vision we were looking for our big day. Any questions that we had, he was there to answer- whether it was a call, text or an email. We felt comfortable from day 1, and from the second we met Max- we knew this was the right decision for us.   
  
On our wedding day, we were blown away by the impeccable service and warmth we felt from the entire team from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Our groom and bridal attendants were amazing. If anyone forgot anything (or my sisters husband breaking his bow tie), they magically got it for us instantly. The details that you don't even think about were beyond amazing throughout the entire day.   
  
You all made our wedding day so beyond special for us and truly unforgettable!  
  
Max, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you so much for everything- we cannot thank you enough.

Professionalism at its finest

We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding day.  
The space is elegant and beautifully maintained, the staff were incredibly attentive both before and on the day of the wedding.   
Our guests are still raving about the atmosphere and food and it’s now four months later.   
Thank you for helping make our big day truly unforgettable!  
Michael and Gitty

The best!!!

The Crystal Plaza is an exceptional venue! The team is incredibly helpful throughout the entire process, offering prompt responses at any hour, on any day of the week. On the wedding day, the staff went above and beyond, ensuring every guest had what they needed and that everyone was happy. They are also very accommodating with food requests, making sure all preferences are met. Hunter Janoff was outstanding. He went the extra mile to ensure that every vision we had was brought to life perfectly. If you choose to host your wedding at the Crystal Plaza, you won't be disappointed!!

The perfect venue! Best Custome Service!!

My wife & I hosted our wedding at Crystal Plaza and we could not have dreamed of a better venue for our wedding! The Venue itself is absolutely stunning from the bride/groom suites, the grand ballroom, the atrium, living room and even the bathrooms are award winning!  
  
We were even more blown away by the customer service at the venue! Our point of contact, Max, was so generous and made sure we had everything we could ask for in our dream wedding scenario. Max & Ryan were easy to work with in planning the food and schedule for the wedding day. The amount of food that comes in the package is unbelievable, and it's all delicious! Your guests will be talking about the food alone for years to come.  
  
We can't say enough good things about our Maitre'd Mikhail and our attendants Nina, Lisa, and G who were incredibly friendly, always nearby and willing to provide us with anything we needed while keeping everything on schedule!  
  
Crystal Plaza has perfected the art of hosting a wedding ceremony/reception. The beauty, the customer service, and the quantity & quality of food will give you and your guests the best wedding experience possible!

10/10 Recommend! 

Crystal Plaza is THE place if you want a wedding full of great food, great people, and great vibes. We truly cannot say enough nice things about Max, the Janoff family, and the whole staff at CP. From start to finish, from the very first tour to leaving at the end of our wedding... Max was beyond helpful, honest, and supportive. We felt so confident in him and his staff from the get-go, and they made the wedding process and planning so easy and effortless.  
  
Crystal Plaza is known for their food, and wow did they exceed expectations. Usually couples don't get to eat at their weddings, but we sure did! The food, cocktail hour + dinner + dessert, was top-notch. Our guests are raving about it still! Some saying it was just the best FOOD they've ever had, not even just being at a wedding.   
  
Crystal Plaza is a well-run machine. Every staff member is attentive, but not in your way, kind, but not too nice where it felt fake, and they seem like they truly enjoy working together and for each other. Every single attendant, bartender, waiter/waitress, and staff member, were beyond incredible. We did a t-shirt toss during our introductions, and a few glasses of water got hit and knocked over on a few guests. The way the staff RAN over to these guests to help them dry off was so comforting.  
  
Finally, the venue itself is STUNNING. The upgrades to the ballroom, the bridal suite (penthouse) and groom suite (the vault) were perfect locations to get ready and enjoy our family and friends before the wedding. Not to mention, the atrium for the ceremony is what sold us on the venue.   
  
Overall, we HIGHLY recommend Crystal Plaza for a wedding or celebratory event. The food, atmosphere, and staff, are above and beyond, and will leave your guests raving for weeks and months to come! Thank you, Crystal Plaza!
