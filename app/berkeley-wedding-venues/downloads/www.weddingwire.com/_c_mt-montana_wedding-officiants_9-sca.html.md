Our wedding was a once in a lifetime moment. Small, personal, and created just for us thanks to Vickie's incredible work! Her joy was more than I could have asked for and we just can't thank you enough! She was incredible to work with and was just beyond sweet. If I could describe my experience in one word it would be: Genuine. It could not have been more perfect for us.... From the very beginning, Vickie would keep up communications super quickly and very detailed. Her online guide to our ceremony was so easy to personalize and she was happy to help! It felt like whatever we needed she was always available (even when things got a little crazy; as they usually do with weddings!) She provided everything from a ceremony guide, multiple rehearsal calls, and even a second pair of eyes on your vows! Day-of we got the cutest little booklets to read from that she had printed for us! Vickie, we will never forget the role you played. You make me want to do it all over again! Many blessings and we wish we could use your services again for something in the future!

Just wow… When my wife and I were first looking for an officiant, we were just expecting a warm body to say a few words and do what was legally necessary for us to be married. We honestly were more focused on who the photographer would be and thought that was the more important investment. Well… we were absolutely incorrect. From the start, Jen was an absolute superstar and showed us the value and impact an officiant can bring not only on our wedding day, but the months and weeks leading up to the big day. To be transparent I tried negotiating the price on our first call because the “internet” told me officiants are not that expensive. And boy did I feel like an idiot for haggling her after experiencing the wedding ceremony because Jen absolutely blew us away with her service and efforts throughout the process. In fact, I gave her a tip after the ceremony because we were so impressed. If you are looking for someone who will take the time to truly learn what makes your relationship with your partner special and bring that story to life in your ceremony, Jen is the your girl! No spoilers here, just be ready for lots of tears and special memories you will remember forever ❤️

Dale was a life saver! After a year of planning our wedding, our original officiant canceled on us last minute. Fortunately, Dale was there to rescue our wedding. He took what should have taken months and squeezed it into weeks. His professionalism speaks bounds for his character. He was with us every step of the way, and went above and beyond. In the end, we couldn't imagine our special day without Dale being at that altar with us. I would recommend his services to anyone trying to make their perfect day just a little more perfect. Thank you, Dale!

We couldn’t have asked for a better officiant for our Glacier National Park elopement. Reid Copeland was incredibly friendly, warm, and genuinely cheerful, which immediately put us at ease. He wrote our ceremony ahead of time and invited our feedback, making the entire experience feel deeply personal and tailored to us as a couple. During the ceremony, he beautifully wove in the surrounding scenery—speaking about the rushing rivers and the calm ones—which made the moment feel even more meaningful and connected to Glacier itself. It was thoughtful, heartfelt, and absolutely beautiful. We also truly appreciated him taking care of turning in our marriage license for us—such a helpful and stress-free touch. We are so grateful to have had him be part of our day.

From start to finish working with Shawn was a pleasure. His enthusiasm for his work is like no other. I discovered him on TikTok while researching officiant related subjects. His content brought many things to my attention that I had not previously thought of and with that, I had to hire him. We had our own officiant, a friend, so what we used Shawn for was ceremony script writing, vow assistance, and help with preparing our chosen officiant for our wedding. Shawn has said that the ceremony is one of if not the most important parts of your wedding, and I couldn't agree more. My wedding was a dream come true and the ceremony script and vows were huge contributing factors. Hiring Shawn was one of the best decisions I made for my wedding and was also one of the best values. Do yourself a favor and hire Young Hip and Married for your wedding and vow renewal related needs.

Laura was a joy to work with the entire wedding process. We met several times before our wedding to help shape our ceremony. We had some non-traditional request and she incorporated them and made them seamless. She even had to make adjustments on the fly because of weather and we didn't even notice the changes. She was an absolute pleasure to work with and made our day so amazing.

Sally was perfect! She made our day so special with her thoughtful and beautiful words. The passage we chose, with her help for our ceremony was breathtaking. She was so helpful in the whole process of our wedding. We eloped by ourselves and I told everyone she was our "wedding mom"! It wouldn't have been the same without her. She was very calm and spoke in a gentle and loving way. I highly recommend her!
