Patty’s Floral Design created the most stunning arrangements and bouquet for our wedding. They really took their time designing exactly what I wanted and creating an invoice that really fit my needs and budget. Everything was so beautiful. I can’t get over how gorgeous my florals were. All the guests took them back with them after. I would use Patty again time and again. Just and wonderful experience.

You truly can’t go wrong with Maui Vibes Events. My wedding ceremony and reception were absolutely beautiful, and it’s all thanks to Taisiya’s thoughtful designs and incredible attention to detail. I know I’m a picky customer with many questions that want to know every single thing but Taisiya was very friendly and patient with me, showed and explain everything. She’s easy to work with, full of creative ideas, and worth every penny. Thank you very much!

Our wedding at the Outrigger Canoe Club in Honolulu, Hawaii was nothing short of magical. Walking down the aisle and seeing the floral arch for the first time took my breath away. Framed by the ocean and a glowing sunset, it was a moment I will never forget. From the absolutely stunning bridesmaids’ bouquets, to my own bouquet which was pure perfection, to the table florals that made the perfect centerpieces—every detail was flawless. Communication was amazing, and coordinating PABBI Tropicals with our wedding coordinator at the Outrigger Canoe Club was incredibly smooth. Everything ran so effortlessly. We truly couldn’t have been more honored or grateful for PABBI Tropicals. The beauty and value far exceeded our expectations.

I cannot recommend Skye enough! She is incredibly talented, kind, and dedicated to her craft. Supporting local Hawaiian businesses and mothers is deeply important to me, and working with Kaululani Florals was a perfect fit. She brought my vision to life with traditional Hawaiian floral designs and just the right pops of yellow—it was everything I had imagined and more. From the bouquets to the ceremony florals, everything was stunning and felt deeply personal. Like any wedding, there were a few hiccups along the way, but Skye handled everything with grace and flexibility. She was calm, communicative, and truly went above and beyond to make sure everything turned out beautifully. If you’re looking for someone who truly cares and will deliver florals that are not only gorgeous but meaningful, Skye is the one. Mahalo nui loa for making our wedding so unforgettable 💛🌿

We worked with Cindy’s, specifically with Alex, to create all of the leis for our wedding in July, and they did an amazing job! We wanted to give each of our guests a lei to wear during the ceremony, so we placed a large order of single-strand white orchid leis. Cindy’s provided us with the best pricing for a bulk order without compromising on quality—the leis were fresh and beautiful. In addition to the guest leis, they crafted stunning specialty leis and hakus for our immediate family and wedding party. The pikake and maile leis they made for my husband and me were especially gorgeous and photographed beautifully. They also went above and beyond by delivering all the leis to our venue on the morning of our wedding, which helped keep things stress-free on our end. We couldn’t be happier with the exceptional service and craftsmanship from Cindy’s Lei & Flower Shop and would highly recommend them for any of your lei needs!

I highly recommend Designs by Hemingway for your wedding, event, or photoshoot! We had a destination wedding on Oahu and despite living out of state, Debbie was organized and easy to communicate with throughout the entire process. For our wedding, I had a general idea of color scheme and the locations we wanted florals, but Debbie put together a beautiful pamphlet with a color palette and sample displays to give a thorough understanding of how it would all come together, which was incredibly helpful. We requested the bridal bouquet, some loose blooms, and hair florals be delivered early for getting ready photos at the hotel and they were delivered in a timely manner, packaged beautifully, and even included care instructions— we really appreciated the thoughtfulness and attention to detail. When we arrived at our venue we were blown away with the floral designs. Everything was vibrant and beautiful, it looked like art that completely transformed our ceremony and reception area. As a wedding photographer, I work with many florists for weddings and photoshoots, but the artistic skill, creativity, attention to detail, and friendly staff makes Designs by Hemingway stand out as one of the best I’ve seen! Thank you Debbie for providing such an excellent service and customer experience! You helped to make our wedding day extra special! (Photos by Mary Costa Photography)

I worked with Eileen on the flowers for my April 2012 wedding and she was courteous, professional, and prompt. Because my wedding was on the weekend (on a day that the florist was usually closed), the staff made arrangements for my family to pick up the flowers at the shop. The flowers were beautifully arranged and of the highest quality. I was lucky to have had them and would not hesitate to do so again.

Fong is AMAZING! This woman has such a wonderful gift and talent. I wanted sort of an ombre look to my purple theme and she NAILED IT! I knew the flowers were going to be pretty, but when I saw my bouquet and my bridesmaids bouquets, I stopped in my tracks. I am still in awe just looking at the pictures on my phone. They were absolutely gorgeous and above and beyond what I expected. Fong is extremely professional and was such a warm and kind person. Such a joy to work with! It is rare to find someone who will be honest and have the best interest of the client in mind, but Fong is definitely one of these people. I highly recommend Floral Inspirations as a vendor to anyone. :)
