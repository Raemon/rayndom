The Watercress Trio performed beautifully at our Maronite Catholic wedding ceremony. We've received many compliments from our guests about the ceremony. The Watercress Trio were not only flexible in performing traditional hymns but were so patient during some very challenging circumstances in the lead up to the wedding. We are so grateful to Ellen and the team. We would highly recommend them.

The string quartet at our wedding was an absolute highlight! Their performance created an enchanting atmosphere, elevating our ceremony to a magical level. The musicians showcased incredible skill, seamlessly weaving through a diverse repertoire that perfectly captured the essence of our love story. From classical elegance to upbeat celebrations, their versatility was exceptional. Not only were they technically proficient, but their professionalism and attention to detail ensured a seamless collaboration. Our guests were thoroughly impressed, and the quartet's melodies lingered in our hearts, creating unforgettable memories. We wholeheartedly recommend Lake String Quartet for anyone seeking a musical ensemble that turns a beautiful day into an extraordinary symphony of love. Thank you for making our wedding day truly special!

Laurie was super easy to work with and they have a great list of music to choose from! They also put together a request for me that wasn't on their repertoire list and did a fantastic job. I had multiple guests come up to me after the ceremony who said they enjoyed music. I highly recommend Ovation String Quartet!

This group is amazing! They are talented and can play anything. People are still coming up to me commenting on how wonderful the music was at our wedding. But what really makes Loring String Quartet stand apart from others is the time and energy Conor put into helping me arrange the pieces. His knowledge runs deep and his sincerity shines bright. The help he provided us is priceless and the musical talent was the icing on the cake!! They may be a touch more than other quartets, but they are worth their weight in gold!!

This girl is a SUPERB!!!!... it's Kelsey Rae Moehle she is a singer/songwriter and pianist all-in-one. our guests were in 'Aw' with her talent and standing at the alter with her singing in the background brought chills to me, her words were so heartfelt on an orignal song she wrote, and angelic with the reset. She is a true professional and it was a real honor to have her a part of our wedding memories. She is Excellent!!!

We had a blast at our reception. They did a variety of fun music to dance to. Everyone thought our band was the best they'd ever heard at a wedding.

With wedding venues now going away from the church setting, I still feel it is important to still have musicians at the ceremony. And I fell Legacy Ensemble fits the perfect niche to provide beautiful music for such a joyous occasion. They did wonderful job and I would recommend them.
