She was patient with us and our many questions throuhgout the process. She was also flexible when we had to make changes to our seating chart the weekend before our wedding. We loved that the venue was able to accommodate our guests' various dietary restrictions. The venue had a wide variety of options to choose from for entrees, appetizers, and desserts.   
  
The day itself went off without a hitch and we loved seeing our vision come to life! The food was amazing, especially the roasted acorn squash! Our bridal attendant, Darlene, was so helpful. She made sure that we had what we needed throughout the whole night, including making sure that the two of us were able to eat during the cocktail hour and the reception. We were so thankful for her help throughout the whole event. The biggest highlights of the night were having our first look in the shark tunnel and the cocktail hour penguin! Our guests seemed like they had just as much fun as we did

The cooolest wedding

This was the only venue we toured, and it was the only one we needed to see! Megan was INCREADIBLY helpful throughout the year-and-a-half long process, and Sammy and the rest of the catering staff were a well oiled machine. Getting decorations and photos done in the aquarium was a snap! I would love to hold another event here, if given the chance!  
  
Plus, how can you beat getting married with sharks swimming by? Or enjoying cocktail hour with a penguin?  
  
It was a blast, and I wish I could do it all over again!

We Couldn't Have Asked for a Better Place to Have Our Wedding

I cannot recommend this venue enough! If you want somewhere unique that is beautiful and all-inclusive, this is the place for you. We had our wedding in the Currents Ballroom which was such an amazing space. We and especially our guests loved the view of the shark tank the whole night. They were mesmerized and it's just such a nice space that felt so perfect for the vibe we were going for.   
  
Terry helped us from start to finish. She was incredibly responsive, so sweet and helpful and worked with us to create the day we wanted. She's an absolute gem.   
  
The food was delicious, even my dad (who is a bit of a food snob, loved it). The cake from Sunflour Bakeshop was beautiful and delicious. We also did the sundae station which was also a hit with the guests and really good.   
  
Our bartender was great, the staff were great as was the service, and our bridal attendant Darlene was incredible. She was so attentive to us and made sure we had our hors d'oeuvres during cocktail hour, that we were hydrated, and that we were fed and taken care of throughout the night.   
  
As far as experiences, we highly recommend the penguin cocktail hour encounter! We had Marina the penguin, she was adorable and a big hit with our guests. She was precious. Take advantage of the photos in the shark tunnel as well! It's such a cool spot and you get some incredible shots there.   
  
Our guests are still talking about the wedding and how much they loved it and how much fun they had and we still are so happy with our experience and they day and we cannot thank Terry and the team at the Aquarium enough for making our day so memorable!

Could Not Recommend Getting Married At The Aquarium Enough! 

We are not usually ones to give reviews but felt that we had to in this case. Megan and her staff were fabulous from start to finish. our wedding was absolutely gorgeous and loved by all. If we had any issues along the way, Megan made sure that all were made right. Her, Sammy, and Darlene were GREAT. Will add more photos when we get our professional pictures back but wanted to make sure we gave a shout out to Megan and her team right away!

Wedding venue of our dreams!!!!

Beautiful space, incredible staff, DELICIOUS food - I cannot recommend enough hosting your wedding at Adventure Aquarium!! Every step of the planning process was a wonderful experience, and Megan Aldrich and her team are FANTASTIC and such a joy to work with!!  
  
Our wedding was on April 13, 2024 with about 130 guests, and Currents Ballroom was the PERFECT space! The room is stunning and so elegant, and our wedding guests were all so surprised and in awe of the floor-to-ceiling height shark/underwater view. Upon meeting Megan and seeing the venue for the first time, we knew immediately that this was going to be the venue for us (we also proceeded to cancel all of our other venue visits and book right away)! Being able to add the "Meet a Penguin" was such a fun and memorable opportunity that made our wedding extra fun for our guests (and for us!!). Our guests didn't know what to expect with an aquarium wedding venue, but were pleasantly surprised by how beautiful the space was, and had so much fun taking pictures against the underwater backdrop.   
  
Even more importantly than the stunning space - I cannot rave enough about what a joy it was to work with Megan and her team!!! From day one, Megan was very communicative and accommodating with helping us make our wedding vision come true. The private food tasting experience was so much fun, and Megan helped us so much with thinking through some of the day-of details during our food tasting. Leading up to the day of our wedding, Megan also handled coordinating with all of the vendors we had booked regarding set up/tear down, and other day of details. She and her team were also FANTASTIC on the day of our wedding as well!!! The night ran so smoothly and the set up/transition of the space from the ceremony to the cocktail hour to the reception was absolutely flawless. The staff truly went above and beyond to make sure our ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception spaces were decorated beautifully, and we are extremely grateful for all that they did to make our day so perfect. The team is extremely detail-oriented, accommodating, and kind. The bridal attendant Darlene was also so wonderful and made sure that my husband and I always had food and drinks!  
  
THE FOOD: The in-house food provider for Adventure Aquarium (Aramark) truly knocked it out of the park!!! We were so excited about how delicious everything was at the food tasting, and the food was equally delicious the day of our wedding as well! We opted to go with the buffet-style dinner and ended up choosing to pay a little bit extra to add a 4th entree because everything tasted so good!! The open bar was also fantastic - staff were super friendly and attentive. For the bar we were able to customize a signature drink, and they also did not skimp on the champagne toast provided! A wedding cake provided by Sunflour Bakery was also included in our package and the cake was SO delicious our guests didn't leave a single piece leftover!  
  
We are incredibly grateful to Megan and her team for helping us make our wedding day so special and so memorable. Everything was exactly as we envisioned it and we had the absolute most perfect wedding day at Adventure Aquarium. Our guests kept raving to us that this was one of the most memorable weddings they had been to and that the food, drinks, and event space were amazing! We HIGHLY, highly recommend booking your wedding here for an experience that you and your guests will never forget!

A Venue to WOW Your Guests!

I cannot share enough great things about having my wedding at Adventure Aquarium. It was an all-around great experience from planning all the way through to the actual event.  
  
The event coordinator, Terry, is very communicative and accommodating. She was detail oriented and never made me feel like my questions or requests were a burden.  
  
The venue itself is FABULOUS. Being able to add things like touch-a-stingray or meeting a penguin to the cocktail hour truly made this wedding one of a kind for the guests. Not only that, but the Currents Ballroom event room is incredibly gorgeous. Your guests will likely not know what to expect when they find out your wedding is at an aquarium. They will expect fish and fun but when they walk into that ballroom they will be stunned with how gorgeous and elegant it is.   
  
The AAQ has their own in-house food provider with Aramark. Oh my word - the food was delicious. Our tasting was such a great time and I was blown away by how yummy everything was - even things I normally wouldn't eat. We wound up paying extra for a fourth option because everything was just so good. They have a signature cocktail called the Shark Bite which is also just perfect for any wedding. A wedding cake, provided by Sunflour Bakery, is also included in their package and the cake at Sunflour is super delicious as well.  
  
The staff on the night of was fabulous! Our bridal assistant, Darlene, was a super woman! She kept an eye on my husband and I all night and helped with everything from keeping an eye on my elderly father, to making sure we had food from cocktail hour, to even providing us with Adventure Aquarium tumblers when my husband said he wanted a cold soda in the biggest cup they had! The servers and bartenders were personable and attentive.  
  
I always wanted to get married at the Aquarium and I am happy to say that the night was a dream - exactly the way I envisioned it. It was worth every penny spent and aside from having the night of your life, you will be giving your guests an experience they too will never forget!

Magical Wedding

We had our ceremony and reception at the aquarium on 4/14/2023 and had the best evening! It's amazing how the aquarium transforms perfectly to host a wedding. Their was a great variety of food to chose from and it was all good. Terry was easy to work with and very responsive. She gave opinions when requested or needed, but really worked with us to make sure the day was our vision and was never pushy. Our only critique is that it would be easier if there was communication between catering and the main aquarium staff, as we had some difficulty when we went to pick up decorations after the wedding. But overall, our wedding was unique and totally us, we couldn't be happier!

Amazing Experience

Our wedding at Adventure Aquarium on 10/28/22 was fantastic. Terry and her team were so amazing in every way. We didn't really have a vision or know what to do, and they worked with us to figure out what we wanted and needed. The food was absolutely delicious, the staff extremely attentive, and all the activities were so fun. We chose the South Seas and kept the touch tanks open. Everyone loved it, and I don't think anyone can top our wedding!

Adventure Aquarium is such an awesome place for your event.
