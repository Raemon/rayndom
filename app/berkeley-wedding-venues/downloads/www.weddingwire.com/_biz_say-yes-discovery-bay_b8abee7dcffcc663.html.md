Janette is the best ! 

We were so fortunate to have Janette as the officiant for our wedding ceremony. From the very beginning, she made the entire process smooth and stress-free. She communicates with such clarity and patience, always making sure we understood each step and felt comfortable. Every question we had was answered thoughtfully, and she handled all the arrangements with professionalism and efficiency.  
  
On the day of our wedding, Janette arrived right on time and immediately put us at ease. She carefully chose a beautiful spot for the ceremony and delivered the wedding script with such elegance and warmth. Her pacing was perfect—calm, steady, and heartfelt—which made the whole moment feel so meaningful and personal. It truly felt like she was creating something just for us, not just reading words from a page.  
  
What impressed us most is how she combined professionalism with genuine care. For the fee we paid, we felt we received not just a service, but a deeply personal experience. She took the time to ensure every detail was right, and because of her, our ceremony was everything we hoped it would be—intimate, graceful, and unforgettable.  
  
We will always remember the beautiful atmosphere she created on our special day. Thanks to Janette, we now have a memory we’ll cherish forever. If you’re looking for someone who is reliable, professional, and truly dedicated to making your wedding ceremony perfect, we couldn’t recommend Janette enough.

I DO!!! 1000% i recommend Janette! -2025 bride

Stop looking for an officiant! call her now! im from LA and we got married in SF. i felt completely safe, secure, and well taken cared of by Janette. We communicated over e-mail and google video meets. She was amazing throughout the whole process before the wedding. On our actual wedding day our ceremony venue had a power outage and we had to change venues last min. Janette accommodated the DAY OF VENUE CHANGE and we still had a magical wedding. She is an amazing human, u can tell she enjoys her work and is happy to be a part of your day. Very professial. i can't say enough great things about her.

Janette is the best!! 

Janette is just the sweetest. Our wedding day became a bit hectic when the city of San Francisco had a power outage that affected most of the city. Long story short, Janette did everything to accommodate us with our last minute changes, she came to a different venue at a different time and was so sweet and we are so glad we chose her to join us on our special day. I cannot recommend her enough, from our first communications and discussions to when we said I Do. Janette is the best!!!

Stress-Free, Thoughtful, and Perfect

We had such a wonderful experience with Janette as our officiant and couldn’t be more grateful for her support throughout the entire process. One of the most important things for us was finding someone who was truly familiar with San Francisco City Hall, and Janette exceeded our expectations. She walked us through the entire City Hall ceremony step by step, which made everything feel calm, organized, and stress-free.  
  
Leading up to the wedding, Janette was prompt, patient, and incredibly accommodating. She even met with us over Google Meet to help finalize our vows and ceremony script, answering our many, many questions with kindness and care.  
  
On the day of, she was professional, reassuring, and made everything run smoothly. We truly felt supported and confident thanks to her expertise and guidance. We highly recommend Janette to any couple—especially those getting married at San Francisco City Hall—who want an officiant that is experienced, thoughtful, and genuinely invested in making your day special.

A Ceremony We Will Never Forget 

From the moment we met Janette, we felt completely at ease. She made our ceremony feel deeply personal, meaningful, and filled with so much warmth and intention. The way she spoke about love and commitment truly captured who we are as a couple, and she created a moment that felt both intimate and unforgettable.  
  
Janette didn’t just officiate our wedding—she helped shape one of the most special moments of our lives. Her presence, kindness, and professionalism made our ceremony feel sacred and genuine, and it’s a moment we will carry with us forever. We will never forget how special she made our day, and we are incredibly grateful to have had her be part of it.

Janette is the Best!!

Janette is phenomenal and an absolute joy to work with! We highly recommend her!! She is a true professional with great communication, patience, knowledge, and attention to detail. Janette provided us with materials before our initial meeting, answered our questions, and provided guidance and options for the ceremony script! Her kindness and warmth made us feel at ease on our wedding day 🙂 We are incredibly grateful for Janette and her support!

The best officiant!

Jannette is very professional, sweet, and detailed. We had a meeting with Jannette prior to the wedding day to make sure we were a good match and on the same page. She understood us, and we felt very open to sharing our wishes with her. She gave us many options for what our ceremony script could lok like and created a custom script to perfectly fit our wishes. She was very informative and helpful on anything we needed and was overall so easy to work with! On the day of, we felt so connected to her and felt as if we knew her, she has kind eyes and a kind voice, we are so happy we chose her to be our officiant.

Ceremonial Union

Janette was fantastic and very accommodating. My partner and I decided to have a Commitment Ceremony on the beach. We did not actually get married but wanted to commit in the eyes of God.   
  
After almost 8 years of being together we decided in September to take next step and commit to one another. One day we will take the next step and get married.   
  
Janette was available whenever needed to speak about plans for the ceremony and we only gave a short notice request. She kept in touch, communication and helped plan our Ceremony. It was very simple and private which is what we wanted.  
  
We had a total of 4 people who were present including myself and partner. She provided a witness per our request. The witness was very kind as we were going to prop up our camcorder on the chair but due to my medical issues didn't provide them. We were originally going to have the Ceremony at one beach but due to dredging the beach that day it was not available at the time we needed. Janette and her witness suggested another location very close to there and it all worked out.   
  
I would very much recommend Janette. 🥰 She was like an old friend who wanted to make our day special. Her script was beautiful and she provided before the ceremony to make sure we approved especially since we didn't need any pre rehearsal dinner or breakfast. Thank you for making our special day wonderful and including a wonderful prayer and our exchanging of vows. Our exchange of rings was very memorable. 💖🫠🙏.

Say YES to Say Yes

Janette was the perfect officiant for our ceremony. We eloped in San Francisco all the way from Georgia, so everything had to be planned virtually (which can be a little stressful) but Janette made the whole process feel easy and seamless.  
  
From the very beginning, she made us feel welcome, supported, and completely at ease, even from across the country. Not only did she help guide us through the ceremony planning, but she also went above and beyond by sharing some amazing honeymoon recommendations based on her own experiences.  
  
We’re so happy we chose Say Yes and even happier that Janette was part of our special day.
