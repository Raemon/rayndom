AMAZING!!! From the very first visit, we knew Soldiers & Sailors was the perfect venue for us. Amber and her incredible team were truly the cherry on top of this gorgeous space. Communication was seamless, planning felt effortless, and every single person we met at Soldiers & Sailors was an absolute joy to work with. Amber (and her team) have such a gift for what they do — she truly thinks of every detail and goes above and beyond to make your day perfect. One thing that really stood out to us, and something you won’t find at every venue, is the remarkable attention to detail and all the behind-the-scenes magic that happens without you even realizing it. We truly can’t say enough wonderful things! Thank you, thank you to the entire Soldiers & Sailors team — our day was an absolute dream, and that’s in huge part thanks to you!

My husband and I had multiple guests tell us our wedding was "the best ever." This was in part thanks to Bartram's Garden!! The scenery/natural backdrop throughout the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception are gorgeous. The food (especially passed apps) are delicious. And the service is impeccable. Working with Kelly throughout the planning made what many find stressful to be an easy process -- she is patient, communicative, and helpful! Our day-of-coordinator, Saayid, was perfect. He attended to all our guests' and our needs. Getting married at Bartram's was a total dream!

Fonthill Castle is a scenic and majestic location for a wedding. The farm-to-table food by Jeffrey A. Miller takes the event to another level.

Patrick, I did not want one more day to go by without thanking you for the wonderful rehearsal dinner we held at the Inne last Wednesday evening. The wait staff was top shelf, more than earning the generous gratuity I provided. The food was delicious, the ambience exceptional, and everyone had a wonderful time, so thank you again for a job well done. Customer service doubled, customer service tripled, customer service quadrupled! Bravo!

We recently celebrated our wedding ceremony and reception at Appleford in October 2025 and the day was an absolute dream! We knew Appleford would be the venue of our dreams after our initial tour, exploring the beautiful grounds and seeing the historic charm of the property; we were immediately captivated by the romantic atmosphere. Lisa was such a pleasure to work with from scheduling our initial tour and becoming a partner throughout the planning process leading up to our big day - she is remarkable at what she does! We are beyond grateful we chose Appleford to celebrate our wedding day. You can feel the magic in the air as soon as you step foot onto the property. Thank you Appleford!

Morris Arboretum was an amazing and beautiful wedding venue. They worked with us every step of the way to make our day as special as possible. Luckily, we experienced great weather, but if we did not, they were ready to go with a back up plan. The Rose Garden was so beautiful for the ceremony and Out on a Limb was perfect for cocktail hour. We highly recommend using them as a venue. So amazing!!! Thank you Morris!

We had the pleasure of having our wedding at Pittsburgh's Grand Hall at The Priory in March 2023. Since many of our guests traveled from out-of-town for the wedding, we also utilized all of the rooms at the adjacent Priory Hotel for the weekend. We are beyond thrilled with how everything turned out and would highly recommend hosting a wedding or any other special event at this venue. As a special event venue, the Grand Hall at the Priory is truly one-of-a-kind – with history, charm, and beautiful details unseen in other venues like stained glass windows and an overlook choir loft. When you combine that with the modern touches – spectacular food, valet parking, full-service packages reasonably priced, hotel on-site – it’s hard to find another venue in Pittsburgh that can compete in our opinion. In addition, we were especially dazzled by the outstanding service we received throughout the planning process, at the Grand Hall on the day of our wedding, and the Priory Hotel itself. Courtney (Director of Events & Catering Sales), Jennifer (Event Manager), and Luciano (Guest Services Manager) are absolute pros and everyone that we came into contact with was extremely helpful, friendly, and accommodating (Nicole and Logan at the hotel front desk, Janet at our wedding, everyone really). If you are looking for a great wedding experience that will “wow” your guests (ours are still talking about how great everything was and how unique the Priory is), we would encourage you to consider this venue.

Knowlton Mansion was the best choice we made for our wedding celebration. We feel so grateful that my mom found this venue and we ran with it. We already had the best first impression and they did not disappoint until the very end. Everyone we talked to and worked with was so nice, accommodating, patient, and professional. From the very first person, Cara, who introduced us to the venue and the logistics, to Eileen the event manager, to Rebecca the day of manager, and the bridal attendant were all SO personable and supportive and focused on helping us fulfill our vision. We really appreciated how patient they were with us. Also would like to point out how easy it is to communicate with the team and have all of our questions answered throughout the entire process. Eileen was particularly so helpful and responsive ! They also kept us accountable with reasonable and very clear timelines. On the day of, Rebecca was so receptive and clear in that she is there to support us and answer any type of question ever. Ok and the FOOD was something else! All of our guests from different parts of our lives were similarly huge fans of the food and the portion. The hors d'oeuvres were such a hit and the entree was so good and great portions. They left feeling so full and satisifed which was so important to us. Knowlton Mansion was such an important factor to why our wedding day was the best day of our lives. We wish we could go back to this most perfect day.

Megan and Melissa are absolute rock stars!! We switched venues about 45 days before our wedding and they worked so hard for us! I like to say they helped us plan 3.5 weddings because of the constant changes made with COVID restrictions. They were kind, caring, hard-working, detail- oriented and efficient. They knew what to do, when to do it and how to do it! We could not be more thankful to the two of them for helping our day go off without a hitch!! We had the most perfect day and it was all thanks to them!!
