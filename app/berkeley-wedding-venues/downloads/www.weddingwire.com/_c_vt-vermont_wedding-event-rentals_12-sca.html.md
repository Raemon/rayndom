We worked with Vermont Tent Company, particularly with Emily, for our wedding, and the experience was fantastic. Emily was incredibly responsive and offered helpful design guidance that informed our final selections. She even mailed over 20 napkin samples to me in New York, which was a lifesaver since I wasn’t local and had trouble deciding based on photos alone. Her expertise was evident every step of the way, and the team was punctual, professional, and efficient. The chairs and napkins we rented for our reception at the Woodstock Inn really brought our vision together, and we couldn’t have been happier with how everything turned out. I would strongly recommend Vermont Tent Company!

Foster's Tent Rental provided the tent for our wedding and it exceeded our every expectation. we hosted an outdoor wedding reception at Valcour Inn and Boathouse, and with Foster's help we were able to host an incredible reception that felt like it was in an open air ballroom. We worked tirelessly with Kyle from Fosters to ensure we were on the same page in every aspect of the tent, quite literally from floor to ceiling. And after all of that hard work planning, a supply chain mishap forced us to change our entire plan. However, Kyle was a great sounding board and provided us with every conceivable option and put in a lot of work to make it happen. Once we finally saw the finished product the night before the wedding we were pleased beyond our wildest dreams. What they were able to do to a tent to make it feel like an elegant space was something to behold. We cannot recommend them and their work highly enough.

Celebrations Rentals were so easy and efficient to work with. They coordinated with my venue (Trailside Inn) seamlessly.

For our outdoor reception, we rented a sailcloth tent (with sidewalls), string lights, decor wire, dance floor and chairs from Undercover Tents. The end result was a magical, twinkling tent that shielded us from the rain! We loved how the sailcloth fabric was very slightly translucent, and that the tent had rounded corners with interior poles that looked like wood. Our florist was able to add decoration to the decor wire. The dance floor was the perfect size - including for our first dance. The wooden chairs added a warm, organic aesthetic. Undercover Tents worked with our venue, Lake Morey Resort, to set up the tent in advance, so there was no last-minute rush. And, the fact that their website features a video of them building a tent gave us confidence that they focused on building sturdy tents! Erin was a pleasure to work with. She was very sweet and patient. As we finalized guest counts, Erin mocked up layouts and coordinated with the venue so that they would know where to put dinner tables, cake and side tables, number of chairs per table, etc. I asked a lot of questions as I didn't know much about tents, lights, and decor; at times, communication was a bit difficult due to my lack of knowledge. Even though a competitor offered more options (that were easily understandable from their website and also mocked up a layout from the very first inquiry), we ultimately went with Undercover Tents for their experience in building tents and working with our venue. We were thrilled with our gorgeous, fairytale tent!

Due to COVID, my husband and I decided to move forward with a backyard wedding rather than our originally planned wedding at an all-inclusive venue. Our wedding date was less than 2 months out by the time we decided to shift gears and we were scrambling to replan everything. One of our biggest fears was that our wedding would not be as beautiful as we were originally envisioning but it ended up being better! Taylor Rental was truly one of our saviors as we replanned our special day! We rented a GORGEOUS sailcloth tent, a restroom trailer with flushing toilets, beautiful wooden chairs, glasses and napkins. They delivered everything and set up the tent for us even though the wedding was 2.5 hours away from their warehouse. They also sent out one of their employees to assess the property prior to us selecting a tent to ensure we wouldn't have any issues the day before the wedding. While there were some small gaps in communication from time to time, overall, the team was great to work with and we had an amazing experience! We would highly recommend them to anybody looking for beautiful, modern rentals for their wedding or other event.
