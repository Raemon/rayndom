Beautiful venue

The Club at Castlewood - the venue is absolutely perfect. It is a beautiful place to get married. The palm trees that line the entrance is such a show-stopper. Sandy and her team were so receptive and responsive to everything my husband and I wanted. I used an outside caterer as my husband and I wanted family-style Asian cuisine so I cannot speak to the food here. I had a guest count of a bit less than 200.   
Pros:   
\- Multiple locations for guests to hang out and mingle that wasn’t the reception hall (outside patio, indoor bar area with couches, lobby area with more couches)  
\- Bar area was huge and quick to serve my guests. Many guests told me the bartenders that worked at our wedding were some of the best ones they’ve seen. We upgraded the bar package at the last minute, and it was worth it to us.   
\- The men and women’s locker room has a cute area to get ready in, chairs, couches, lounge chairs, make up stations (and showers)! They also have a lot of amenities including razors, combs, hairspray, deodorant, etc.   
\- Service was awesome. They refilled waters, bussed tables, all of the above.   
\- Allowed us to leave our decor there the day prior so we wouldn’t have to do it the day-of (even though there was an event the night before!) It was about 4 large totes, 6 smaller ones, and a few easels.   
\- We had asked for a golf cart to wheel some older guests back up to the reception area after the ceremony. They almost forgot this until my coordinator asked the banquet manager. Thankfully they were able to do it for us in the end.   
Cons:  
\- Outside caterer has to cook outside which is one level below the reception hall. This is particularly difficult without an elevator to help get to the reception area, especially since we were doing family-style and not buffet, which means plates for each and every table. We were able to come to an agreement on how to make it work, but it was a bit challenging on all parts.   
\- There’s no dedicated bridal suite so my things were out in the open for the club members to see and possibly take. On the day of, it didn’t matter too much as nothing went missing, but it was stressful thinking about it leading up to the event. I also felt bad I basically took over the whole area away from the club members. It would be helpful to have our own space to change.   
\- That being said, there isn’t a designated groom suite either. He had to leave his clothes in the women’s locker room after changing.  
We knew about the cons before booking with Castlewood, but due to how beautiful it was and that they could hold my guest count indoors in a reception room, we went with them anyway, but I still wanted to point those out to future brides and grooms.

This venue is absolutely gorgeous! Randie was fantastic to work with. She went above and beyond to accommodate our every need for our wedding day. She was prompt with her e-mail responses, knowledgeable, patient, and attentive to detail. Thank you Randie for making our wedding day so special!

Our daughters wedding reception was held at Castlewood 11/2015. The venue is beautiful. The ballroom host 300 guest. The separate bar and patio area accommodated our guest during cocktail hour. The food and service was excellent. I must also mention our fabulous day of wedding coordinator Jessica Arnold! Jessica is professional and made sure our wedding party and guest were taken care of during this event.

We had our wedding at Castlewood in 2015 and it was amazing. The ballroom for the reception fits about 300 people with high ceiling and chandeliers. The ceremony took place outdoors under a large tree which provided shade for our guests on a hot summer day. The facilities are well maintained. The best part of this venue was the wedding coordinator, Jessica. She made the entire wedding process so stress free. We did not have to worry about a thing because she had everything under control (before the wedding and day-of) and she also packed up our car (with all the wedding gifts, dresses, etc) so that after the wedding we could just hop into our car and leave. Unfortunately, I believe she no longer works there, so hopefully they found a coordinator just as good as she was.

Just had our wedding at Castlewood Country Club this March, 2015. We booked them late Spring of 2014. Their wedding coordinator, Jessica, was fabulous. She made the planning so much less stressful than it could have been. Very flexible and accommodating and the wedding day went so smooth and perfect I couldn't have asked for a more affordable, beautiful and stunning wedding venue!

If I could give them a million stars I would. They made my wedding day the most magical day ever. I not only became a client but I feel like they became family.  
  
Karen, the coordinator was above and beyond amazing. I loved working with her and would do it all over again.  
  
The location was beautiful. there were so many gorgeous places to get so many amazing pictures.

My husband and I could not have picked a more beautiful venue than Castlewood Country Club. Our outdoor wedding was exquisit! The grounds are so green and so well taken care of, our guests couldn't stop taking pictures of themselves surrounded by the beautiful scenery. And inside, there is no need for much decor to have a beautiful & sophisticated atmosphere. The bar area is great & grand ball room even more impressive with its many beautiful chandeliers.  
The staff is so friendly & served delicious meals in a timely manner to all our guests. Malek, one of the staff is perhaps the sweetest man alive. He must have congratulated us at least 20 times that night. And of course, the new coordinator Karen Amstoy is simply the best. She knows what she is doing. I appreciated her quick responses to all my concerns & inquiries. She is a dynamo and I can't thank her enough. She put me at ease taking care of all the little details making sure our big day ran smoothly. Our day couldn't have gone over better. We were so well taken care of that day & night.  
We would definitely recommend Castlewood for any future brides. It is a big bang for your buck!
