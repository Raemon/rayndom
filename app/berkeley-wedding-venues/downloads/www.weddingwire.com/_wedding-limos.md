## Wedding Transportation: Limos and Beyond

Everything about your wedding day should be done in style, which is why finding the right mode of wedding transportation is an absolute must. Wedding limousines are the number one transportation choice for weddings, and for good reason! While you may not be able to control traffic on your wedding day, you do get to control how you get to and from your ceremony and reception. As many happy couples will attest, there is perhaps no better way to arrive in style than pulling up in a sleek wedding limo.

## Wedding Limo Options are Endless

Traditionally, wedding limos have been defined as stretched out town cars with a variety of fun and sophisticated interiors. Such vehicles can seat anywhere from six to 20 people, depending on the size. Features may include bars, mini-fridges, internet access, televisions, and surround sound systems. These days, the term wedding limo encompasses many more types of vehicles than just limos. Wedding transportation can be anything from a vintage sedan or antique truck to a party bus or horse-drawn carriage. Or, you can opt for a truly unique experience like being transported from your ceremony to reception via tandem bicycle, sailboat, Vespa, or dog sled!

When it comes to wedding transportation, you should aim to book transportation for you and your guests to and from your venues about four months before the big day. If your ceremony and reception are not at the same place, transportation is usually made available for the bride and groom, the wedding party, and both sets of parents, siblings, and grandparents. It's important to consider out-of-town guests as well.

Wedding limos ensure that you and your loved ones arrive to your wedding safely and on time. Along with your wedding limos, consider booking shuttles to help transport your guests, too. When booking your wedding transportation, be sure to read reviews from past clients to find a company that’s professional and reputable.

Of course, the number of guests you can provide wedding transportation often comes down to budget. If you don't have the money to transport every guest, don't sweat it. Your guests will certainly understand and make their own transportation arrangements. If you are able to help facilitate rides for individuals without cars, you can organize carpools, or provide rental car or ride-share contact info. This may help ease any potential uncertainty and anxiety for your wedding guests about how they’re going to get around.

## Advantages of Riding in a Wedding Limo

Aside from the obvious sense of style that arriving in a wedding limo (or other chosen form of wedding transportation) will convey, it can also offer a number of other benefits. First, your wedding party can be relaxed and comfortable. This is especially important for brides wearing gowns that take up a lot of space, or for anyone wearing sensitive fabrics that could be wrinkled or damaged during a tight ride. Many also enjoy the privacy that the dark windows of a limo excursion offer.

Second, riding in a wedding limo is a lot of fun. It offers an opportunity to toast your marriage with a bottle of champagne and your closest friends and family, before joining the larger event. At the end of the day, this experience may be one of your fondest memories.

Finally, it is extremely convenient. Your wedding limo driver can pick up and deliver the entire wedding party door-to-door, so you can all arrive quickly and on time. This helps allow for things like taking additional photos, setting up for a reception greeting line before guests arrive, or providing time to simply to catch your breath in anticipation of the big celebration.

## Wedding Transportation: Things to Know Before the Big Day

Before you begin searching for your wedding transportation, make sure you know exactly where you're going and the best way to get there. Research the quickest route from destination to destination and allow some extra time between events in case of unexpected traffic or other delays.

It's also important to meet in person with a representative from the wedding transportation rental company beforehand. This way you can decide if you're comfortable with this particular vendor escorting you from place to place. You can also iron out any questions about the contract. As with every other vendor, be sure to read the entire contract carefully before signing.

If you don't plan on transporting all of the guests within your wedding party, make sure they have appropriate plans for their own wedding transportation. The last thing you want on your wedding day is to be dealing with the logistics of having guests stranded between venues. But don’t worry; with some advance planning, coordinating transportation for your event should be as smooth as the actual wedding limo ride.
