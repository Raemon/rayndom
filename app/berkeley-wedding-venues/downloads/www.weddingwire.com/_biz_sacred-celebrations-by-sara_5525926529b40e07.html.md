Excellent!

Sara was a superb officiant and just what we were looking for. She asked us in-depth questions to get to know us as a couple and formulated a script for the ceremony based on that info in addition to readings we selected and other essential components. She is a great public speaker and even pronounced some tricky family names flawlessly. I would definitely recommend her to other friends and family.
