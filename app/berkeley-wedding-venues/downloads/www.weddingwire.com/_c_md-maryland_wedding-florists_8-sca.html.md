My experience with Adia was nothing short of AMAZING! Adia took her time to figure out what we liked and suggested alternatives to fit our budgets if our vision went over our price point. She asked questions I had never even thought of, which is great because there are so many flowers we had never even seen or heard of! We started out with 3 ideas and Adia helped us narrow it down to one while simultaneously including something from each of the 3 we had in mind. I highly recommend Adia for any floral needs you may have. When you book her, be prepared to be blown away!!!

Had a funeral in Chestertown and I live 1200 miles away. Ordered flowers by phone. I was sent back pictures by my adult son and they were beautifully done. Better than any FTD I have sent in the past. Thank you for getting them on time and gorgeous. It meant a lot.

Rachel Yanky truly exceeded every expectation for our November 2025 wedding. From our very first meetings, my wife and I felt completely confident in Rachel’s vision and expertise. She masterfully brought our terracotta floral dream to life, transforming our venue and creating the romantic, warm atmosphere we had always hoped for. What stood out most was Rachel’s knowledge and eye for design. We didn’t come in knowing specific flowers—we simply knew we wanted lush, live florals that complemented our emerald and terracotta color palette. Rachel guided us effortlessly, selecting blooms that worked beautifully together and elevating the entire aesthetic. Our bouquets were especially stunning: perfectly coordinated yet thoughtfully unique, reflecting each of us while still feeling cohesive. Rachel’s talent, professionalism, and attention to detail made a lasting impression, and we could not be happier with how everything turned out.

Thank you to Gwen + The Willow Oak team! I went in having a general idea what I wanted for a bridal bouquet (color scheme, style) but no idea of flower names or anything specific. I gave Gwen some inspiration photos to work off of and she really delivered! My bouquet was beautiful and fit right in to the rest of the day

We used Fantastic Flowers for our daughter's wedding in June and I could not be more pleased with Bianca and her team! They were responsive, flexible, and dependable. Bianca created a foilage arch that was exactly what we had described to her and was the perfect background for the wedding ceremony. The bouquets and table arrangements were exactly what we wanted and I received numerous compliments on their appearance. The value and service of Fantastic Flowers is exceptional and raises the bar for all vendors. Highly recommend!

Maher’s Florist and Jo Ann were a breeze to work with and made florals one of the easiest parts to plan for my wedding! We had an in-person meeting about 6 months before my wedding after I went back and forth on using rentals or faux florals. Jo Ann was familiar with my venue and was able to bring my vision (and Pinterest board) to life for less than any other quote! She sent a proposal over complete with images and descriptions of chosen flowers/greenery, etc within a few days of our meeting and sent me bouquet pictures the day before the wedding. When I decided to save a little money and used non-floral centerpieces, she updated the proposal and quote immediately, no questions asked. We also had a large wedding party- each and every bouquet, boutonniere, wristlet and flower crown looked impeccable day-of! I would recommend Maher’s to anyone!
