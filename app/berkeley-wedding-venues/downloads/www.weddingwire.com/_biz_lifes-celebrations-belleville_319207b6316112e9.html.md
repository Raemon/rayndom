Extremely Positive Experience

From the time that we initially met Cris until we both said "I do," Cris went above and beyond in making sure he included every detail that we wanted to be a part of our wedding ceremony. From guiding us through the pre-wedding licensing requirements, including a personalized reading, and also helping us find transportation so that our 4-legged was there with us, Cris made it possible for us to have our perfect day. We would recommend Cris' services without hesitation to anyone who asks, and greatly appreciate everything he did for us. Thank you Cris!

Everything flowed perfectly, and so many of our guests commented on how beautiful the ceremony was. We are incredibly grateful he was part of our special day.

Cris was wonderful from the start!

Cris was professional, a great communicator, and made sure our ceremony was perfect. One month prior he drafted the ceremony, and sent it to me for review. Cris has been doing this a long time, and knows exactly what to do to make your wedding perfect.
