## Wedding Dresses and Gowns

As you plan your wedding, one of the most important decisions you’ll make is your wedding dress. The dress you choose should reflect your unique style and personality and make you feel like the most beautiful woman in the room. How does a bride say “yes” to that perfect dress? Here’s a quick guide to shopping for wedding dresses.

## Set Your Budget

When you start browsing bridal gowns, it’s easy to fall in love no matter the price tag. Before you even pick up a bridal magazine, set a strict wedding dress budget. We suggest allocating around 10 percent of your overall [wedding budget](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/wedding-budget.html) to your dress – and don’t forget to include the cost of your [wedding accessories](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/brides-wedding-day-accessories) in that line item!

## Narrow Down Your Style

About a year out from your wedding, start browsing bridal dresses and get a feel for how they match up with your style. Now is the time to educate yourself on silhouettes, necklines, fabrics and more. Our [wedding dress style guide](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-dress-style-guide) can help.

Once you’ve set your wedding date and chosen a venue, add these factors into your dress calculation. Are you marrying in the winter at a beautiful church? Then you might choose a dress with heavier fabric – like satin – in a more traditional silhouette like a ball gown or A-Line.

## Book Wedding Dress Salons

About 10 to eight months before your wedding, it’s time to get boots (or heels) on the ground to start your wedding dress hunt. Consider wedding dress salons in your area and book appointments with your top choices – most salons do not allow walk-ins. Take a look at our complete [wedding dress shopping guide](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-dress-shopping-101) to learn all the tips and tricks to finding the wedding dress of your dreams.

## Trying on Bridal Dresses

As your salon appointments approach, assemble your fashion squad to give you feedback and moral support. Keep your posse small, as too many opinions can get overwhelming. When you arrive at the salon, your stylist will discuss your dress preferences and budget and help you choose options. Keep an open mind; your stylist knows what looks good on different body types. If your stylist suggests a dress, even if it’s not a silhouette you are considering, give it a try. You might be surprised.

## Choosing Your Bridal Gown

When your heart leaps and you can’t stop grinning at the reflection in the mirror, you’ve found the right wedding dress. The salon will likely ask for a down payment and then order your dress. Over the next months, your dress will be created just for you. It should arrive a few months before your wedding so you have time for fittings and alterations at your salon. (See our full [wedding dress shopping timeline](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-dress-timeline).) You may feel like you’re waiting forever, but this is the perfect time to pick your wedding accessories and knock off other items on your [wedding to-do list](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-checklists.html).

Ready to start shopping for wedding dresses? WeddingWire is here to help. Put in your location and search for the top salons in your area. Read reviews and start making appointments. Happy dress hunting!
