We were extremely happy with the perfume table. It was beautifully and thoughtfully designed, professional and very customized to your decor and theme. My mom found this company on Facebook and they were great with our guests and easy to work with through the design process. The perfume set up was pure wedding entertainment. Guests mingled and it was a conversation starter. It was worth every penny. We had 140 guests and it was perfect for a larger sized wedding. We recommend Cheryl and Glitters and Grace for your wedding!

I was a guest at a wedding that Katie completed a date stamp at. Katie was very professional and friendly to talk with. Katie was well prepared and prompt at arriving to set up. The date stamp looked just like the gorgeous Bride and Groom, she did a wonderful job. The date stamp was such a. Nice conversation starter for many guests, myself included. I would definitely recommend Katie’s date stamps for any future weddings!

John did such an amazing job with our painting! We could not be happier. He was also a big hit at the wedding and all our guests loved going up to watch him do his thing. At first we were on the fence about whether or not to splurge on this, and I am so happy that we went through with it. We will truly cherish this painting forever. John is SO talented and I can’t recommend him highly enough.

I used Albanese for the candy bar at my wedding. We knew when we were planning our favors, that we wanted something unique. Albanese isn't far from our house, so we went in and met with Jenn and discussed the cost and details. I am originally from Indianapolis so I wanted a Colts blue themed bar with all kinds of different candy. She walked through the store with us and wrote down all the different blue and white candy we would need. We got a discount b/c we were buying in bulk and she helped us estimate how much of each candy we would need for the amount of guests we were going to have. Since there were some items that they don't sell only blue of, we went online to various candy stores and bought additional blue candy as well. Even though we bought the candy from another place, Albanese still included glassware for the items and I believe we had 20 different candy items total. They showed up well before the reception started and set up everything perfectly. It was tiered so certain items stood out and they even scattered certain wrapped candies on the table to make it look like a true candy land! We got so many compliments on the candy bar and we really loved it! We were charged a setup fee which was $150 and it included the setup and tear down and for using their glassware and scoops. It was more than worth it to not have to worry about setting it up and they even included table cloths to match our wedding colors! The guy who set it up called me the night before to check with me if it was ok that he did things a certain way b/c it was going to be difficult to put that many glass containers on one table! He did an amazing job! A friend of mine from Indianapolis is now having a candy bar at her wedding and I am driving the candy down to her b/c she was so impressed with their variety and cost! Go with Albanese they are amazing!

Although it was on the higher end of what we wanted to spend on favors but it was worth having something that my husband and I both love. The option of creating your own label for the chocolate bars made it so personal, and our guests were so impressed and excited about their treat!

Because my wedding is a few years out, it is harder to be patient with a bride like me as everyone is in the "now" - thank you for recommending vendors that are flex and available to help me with future needs. I would highly recommend abernook gifts to anyone.

So glad I hired Margie! She was referred to me from a friend. Margie sat down with me to review my budget and discuss my vision. She was able to make my very limited budget not only work but look amazing! She took the time to help me feel comfortable with each of the types of flowers she used. There were a ton of last minute changes and additions that she was able to accommodate! On the day of, they delivered the flowers and set up our centerpieces. The already pretty venue was completely transformed and was just gorgeous! I was blown away when I walked in later. It was so nice to not have to worry about setting up and to see it all come together so beautifully. I could not have asked for anything more and am so glad and lucky to have worked with Scheffler's flowers!
