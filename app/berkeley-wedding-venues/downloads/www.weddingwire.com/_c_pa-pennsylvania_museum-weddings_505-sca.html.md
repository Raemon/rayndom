Lindsay O’Brien was absolutely wonderful to work with and made sure every detail of our wedding was perfect. She was kind, professional, and so attentive throughout the entire process. The PA Trolley Museum is such a unique and beautiful venue, and our guests loved the experience. We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect day!

Our experience working with The Franklin Institute was incredible. Gina is an incredible event coordinator, and went out of her way to help us get things sorted all along the way and day-of. Even when the manager and head chef of the catering company exited stage right a month before our date, the team worked with us to assuage our anxiety. It was the best wedding that's ever been, and we're so happy we made the choice to go with The Franklin!

We only looked at two venues and stopped after finding the musuem. The price you literally can not beat for everything you get with it. We had a small intimate wedding of about 53 people and everyone came up to me at the end of the night raving about the location. They loved being able to explore the museum throughout the night. Half way through the wedding process we got a new event coordinator and there were a few times were there was miscommunication but overall it was a good experience. The courtyard with the trees and lighting was perfect for our ceremony and the exposed brick looked amazing in pictures. The lobby was the perfect size for reception and you dont have to do much to it because it's already so pretty inside.

Our wedding at the American Swedish Historical Museum was amazing! We narrowed it down to three possible options within our price range and we couldn't be happier that we chose ASHM. We felt supported throughout the entire planning process. The venue was beautiful inside and out and has such a unique and timeless atmosphere. Luckily it didn't rain, but even if it had, we would've felt comfortable thanks to ASHM helping us create a "Plan B" ceremony inside the museum if need be. The catering was all taken care of as part of our package and the food was delicious. Our guests were all comfortable and it was made easier for our older family members in particular to have the reception on site. The reception was beautiful and fun and there was plenty of room for our 80-plus guests to eat and drink and dance. I wish we could get married there all over again! Thanks ASHM!

The MuseumLab was an absolutely incredible backdrop for our wedding! We booked this venue during covid and they went out of their way to give us a tour of the space over zoom before we decided. That’s just one of the ways Allyson and her team went out of their way to make this process as seamless as possible. I must have sent dozens of emails with questions and Allyson responded to them all within a day. She also coordinated the arrival and set up of all our other vendors and make sure our rehearsal ran smoothly. Throughout the night, Allyson worked with us to accommodate any last minute adjustments and timing changes. I received so many comments from our guests about how beautiful and unique the space was, and the separate spaces for the ceremony and reception helped make each part of the event really special!

Ever since the first time I visited the Penn Museum, I knew I wanted to get married here (it was at least the top candidate in my mind at the time). This was when I had recently met my (now) husband and had recently moved to Philly. That was 9 years ago. Working with Victoria and the staff at the Penn Museum was an absolute pleasure. Victoria was very responsive, met with us multiple times, and never had a problem with us visiting the museum as much as we needed to coordinate the wedding. For the venue fee, we got access to the ENTIRE museum for 5 hours. We could use as many rooms as we wanted. The flexibility they allowed us was remarkable and I am SO grateful for it. The security staff was amazing as well, we had a blast with them on the day of. Victoria allowed us to store items in her office the day before and we were able to pick them up the next day. The museum is gorgeous, the rooms are gorgeous, and we had a beautiful wedding. I do wish they let you into the "getting ready" rooms earlier (I believe the earliest was 3pm) - they just use classrooms for this, which worked out great. But I would have loved the extra time. The day goes by so quickly, it is amazing how little time there is. I also wished we would have added another hour on the back end (additional fee). If I would have a redo, I would have moved all the couples pictures to another day to just focus on the guests and be able to spend as much time with them as possible. So, for future brides, something to take into consideration! Also to note, there is only one caterer that the museum works with. It makes it easy because you do not have to shop around for options, but if you were hoping to shop around (such as for price, budget accordingly), you will not be able to do this with the museum. We had some challenges with communicating with the caterer (some technical), but the service they ended up providing was outstanding. The service blew our guests away. 100% was a five star, fine dining experience kind of service. Food was delicious and they provided plenty of options for us to choose from. The museum put on an excellent event for us and it does really take a huge team of people to pull off a wedding. I would recommend the Penn Museum if you are considering it!

The Brandywine Art Museum team made our night incredible. Our point person, Molly Jo was wonderful to collaborate with and she made every process easy as she worked with us to make our vision happen. Truly a unique venue to host such a celebration. Sharing a meal with our closest friends and family as the sun set over the water was an experience we will never forget. Our guests shared it was the best wedding space they have been to! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

The aquarium was the venue I chose from the Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, and it was worth every penny! They were very accommodating to my guests when it came to the catering due to dietary restrictions. All of the staff was so kind and professional! They got my dream shot under their giraffe, Lewis! I am forever grateful to everyone working here for making my special day unforgettable!

I cannot say enough about how WONDERFUL it was to have our wedding at GoggleWorks!! The space is so beautiful (if you're looking for industrial chic, look no further - exposed brick, natural light everywhere, and art galleries as a bonus!) and everyone there is fantastic. We could not have found a better spot for our big day. While everything about GoggleWorks is wonderful, the thing that makes it truly special, is the events director, Margaret. She is the most attentive, enthusiastic, and organized person I've ever met. She TRULY cared about us and our wedding and went out of her way time and time again (over the course of 4 years due to the pandemic!) to make our day amazing. She made sure that everything was perfect, beyond our wildest dreams. Do yourself a favor and book this venue!! I promise you will not regret it!!

Sandi and her team were absolutely fantastic to work with. She kept everything coordinated, always responded immediately to our questions, and made sure the wedding reception was perfect. We knew our wedding would look good, but we know it was the touches Sandi added that made our jaws drop when we got to walk into our space during the reception. We were so incredibly lucky to work with her. Many of our friends and family told us it was the best wedding they've been to, a compliment that isn't thrown around lightly within our big families!
