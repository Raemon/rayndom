Fernbank is a beautiful venue! We had our first date there, and my fiancé proposed there, so it was incredible to round it all out with our wedding. The staff is communicative, friendly, and easy to work with. We actually had our point of contact change twice throughout the planning process, but each transition was quite smooth and didn’t lead to any bumps in the road for us. We’ve gotten so many compliments from guests about how cool our venue was. If you’re looking for something really unique, Fernbank is the place for you!

My husband and I got married at Callanwolde this past May, and it truly couldn’t have been a more perfect venue for our big day. The estate is stunning, and the flexibility to customize each space really allowed us to make it our own. It felt incredibly intimate, especially knowing that no other events were taking place at the same time. The entire Callanwolde team was wonderful to work with. They are kind, accommodating, and they were transparent with pricing from the very first conversation. We loved being able to bring in our own vendors, including alcohol, which helped us stay within budget. The discount for using preferred caterers was also a great bonus. Plus, knowing our deposit supported arts education at Callanwolde made it even more meaningful. We’d choose this venue again in a heartbeat!

The National Infantry Museum was the perfect wedding venue for us! The location is absolutely stunning, with gorgeous views that made every moment feel magical. Their wedding packages were thoughtfully designed, making it easy to choose exactly what we wanted while staying cost-efficient. As a military child, I especially appreciated the military discount, which helped us save so much on our budget while still enjoying a wedding that looked far more extravagant than what we spent. The staff was truly exceptional—attentive, organized, and committed to ensuring everything went smoothly. They even helped us secure our amazing caterer, Jane Foods, whose roast beef and creamy basil chicken still get compliments from our guests. The entire menu was a hit! The venue itself is beautiful; we were married in the World War II chapel, held our reception in Cavazza Hall, and enjoyed a lovely cocktail hour in the lobby. The grounds offered plenty of picturesque spots for wedding photos. And having a hotel right on the property was incredibly convenient for both us and our guests. The hotel was immaculate, with friendly service that made our stay even better. I can’t say enough good things about the National Infantry Museum—it was everything we hoped for and more!

Zoo Atlanta and Proof in the Pudding Catering provided our family with a stimulating and memorable Wedding venue with a delicious meal. As we enjoyed the company of an elephant, giraffes, zebra, and ostriches my granddaughter was married to a wonderful guy. We then enjoyed a wonderful custom meal and the company of family and friends. Hannah Baber and staff catered to our every wish. The day was thoroughly enjoyed!

The Quinlan is the perfect blend of an elegant and creative space. Just big enough to have a good sized wedding, but small enough that every detail is special and the event feels intimate. The Quinlan staff are friendly and knowledgeable, and they go above and beyond to ensure your event runs smoothly. The sculpture garden is a truly beautiful space, and the galleries inside house gorgeous artwork! Everyone who has seen pictures from our wedding has been blown away by how striking the venue was. I'd recommend them in a heart beat.

We chose the Mighty Eighth because my husband is prior Air Force and we wanted that tied into the wedding. The event staff was amazing. I didn’t realize they had same day coordinators, it was a life saver! They helped me with things I didn’t realize I needed. They were on time with everything and even let me make changes during the reception. The chapel is gorgeous and we loved the art room for the reception. We definitely recommend this venue!

We held our wedding reception at the Jepson Center for the Arts on March 21, 2015. Every step in the process, from the initial meeting and walk through to the execution of the event, was handled with professionalism. The booking process is straight-forward, with no hidden fees or charges, and we were even able to use some of the furniture in the museum (benches, high boys, etc.) during our cocktail hour, which cut down on rentals. The Jepson maintains a list of recommended vendors, and Allison Hamilton, manager of special events, made very helpful recommendations. She was prompt and courteous in responding to questions. Because it is a museum, there are some restrictions (i.e. no open flames), but they are manageable. The museum is a spectacular venue for special events. We enjoyed it, and our guests did as well. I would recommend it to other brides and event planners.

I cannot say enough nice things about our reception at the Marietta/Cobb Muesum of Art. The event service provided was amazing. Everyone was complimenting every aspect of the reception -- the food, the venue, the service, the beauty, the easy-going feel. The food did not dissapoint -- we did a southern menu that was buffet style where the guests could go back for more and more. Our food included a pecan cheese roll, stacks of fresh fruit, roasted vegetables with goat cheese, barbeque pork tarts, fried chicken bites, fried green tomatoes, and steak skeweres. Not to mention a grits bar with two types of grits and toppings as well as a carving station with sirloin. As a born southerner, I love all of these items but everyone couldn't stop saying enough. I wanted to sit there and eat instead of talking to all of my guests =) Thankfully, the wedding coordinator Rhonda had arranged for two heaping plates of food and 10-15 minutes of alone time so that we could catch a breath to eat and relax before the madness began. Rhonda is the contact for the Museum and I certainly can't say enough nice things about her as well. She is a wonderful resource for all things weddings and thinks about every tiny detail. She was always accessible by phone and e-mail. 4 months before the wedding, we met with her to go over what food we wanted, what linen colors on the tables, how we wanted the colors for the buffett, if we wanted a wedding cake and how we wanted it, and a million other details. Carriage House Catering/Event Staff took care of everything -- they charge you one price that includes it all including tipping, etc. They clean up. This is one of the only caterers I found that for the wedding cake gave me options: 1) I could get my wedding cake from them OR 2) I could bring in a cake from somewhere else without penalty, they would plate the cake and serve for no extra fee, AND they would have given me back the cake amount from the cost if I didn't have them make it. It was a lovely day and I felt that not only was it everything that I hoped for for my reception, the value was tremendous. They have menus to work with any budget. I could have spent much more on a plated dinner but I found the buffet menu preferable (and less expensive!). Can't say enough. Rhonda as an event manager and Jeff as the caterer, they are an amazing team!
