Jennifer and the team at Cameo Strings is amazing! We hired them for our wedding in November of 2025 - and they were a hit! I wish I could have the entire hour they played and listened to all the songs - but the videos taken will have to do! Jennifer was so easy to work with when selecting the music and helping create the most romantic setting for our ceremony. Thank you Cameo Strings!!

Wow. Honestly the only words I can think of. Max was the highlight of our wedding- I keep getting compliments about how great he was. He’s an incredible performer who greatly exceeded our expectations. He played SO much more than I was expecting live. He played all of our first dances live (short and sweet and perfect! As we asked- essentially on the fly) and was down to keep playing after his time ended. He was perfect in every way- talented, kind and accommodating. He is the best. I would give him 200 stars if I could. Book him or you’ll regret it!!!

Christi Becker is a true gem. She is so talented, cool, and professional. Her presence elevated our wedding ceremony into a cinematic experience. She can play just about anything, and was down for an adventure. She is amazing!!

The best wedding band ever. We flew DMQ down from Seattle ... a little crazy, but they ended up being the same price as many of the popular bands in the Bay Area. Everyone was dancing all night, young & old. We loved them! Listen to tracks on their site to get a sense. They're kitchy & whimsical.

Alishia was amazing to work, and my favorite vendor we hired for our wedding! She was great in our consultation with explaining her process, playing us examples, and incorporating all of our vision of tone, theme, and a special song request. Her services were a great deal and covered our entire ceremony along with learning the special song. She even sent a preview of the song to make sure we liked it. Her performance had all of our guests crying with emotion, and it was my favorite element of the day. She was so kind too, even tearing up at our relationship story, and we really connected. She's wonderful and I hope we have an excuse to hire her again someday!!

Tori and Bobby Parker are truly talented musicians. They are a violin and guitar duo. We knew from early on that we wanted them to play for our ceremony and we were very happy when they were available and agreed to do so. Being that we are musicians ourselves, we have very high standards, but their music was about as close to perfect as we could get. We got compliments on their playing throughout the reception and several people asked us about how to get in touch with them. They come very highly recommended.

Nicole and the quartet were such an incredible addition to our wedding ceremony! They did a custom song for our walk down the aisle and it was perfect. It was our wedding song and we both cried when I heard how beautifully they played it. Our only regret is not booking them for cocktail hour as well. They played as guests arrived and everyone said they felt like they were on the set of Bridgerton! Such a wide range of song choices in their catalog and it was so fun picking out the songs our guest would hear. Nicole was fanatic in the communication department and we had everything squared away long before our wedding which was so nice to not scramble the last week of with emails. We requested an all female quartet and the delivered that effortlessly! 10/10! Thank you and the quartet so much!

If you like string quartets then Encore Four is for you! Ashley was great to work with. She knew exactly what songs we needed for our wedding ceremony. We had a few songs that we wanted for sure such as “Canon in D by Pachelbel” but other than that she created the playlist. She was very responsive and their music was just exquisite. Also – they were extremely affordable considering the amazing talent.
