She was so flexible and nice! I wanted my daughter to be able to play a song with her on her Viola and she helped her find music and took time to talk with her and practice! She was so nice and I’m so happy she was a part of my wedding!

Katie was absolutely WONDERFUL for our ceremony music! She played during our unity candle lighting and hearing that in the background made everything feel even more special. I can hear it on the wedding video and it sounds so great! Thank you Katie you rock!

Chris and his team was amazing to work with! Everyone at our wedding talked about how great he was at keeping the party going! He definitely kept us on the dance floor! We also did the giggle share, photobooth and monogram, so glad we did all three!!
