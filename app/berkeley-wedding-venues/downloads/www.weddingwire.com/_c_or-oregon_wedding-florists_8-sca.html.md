Michelle was amazing to work with! I gave her a description of my vision for flowers (I love dahlias and wanted sunset colors) and she delivered! All of the bouquets were so beautiful and were all unique but all cohesive. She is very knowledgeable and passionate about flowers and creates such beautiful arrangements. It was so fun to visit her farm and see where all of the flowers were grown. Her delivery service made everything so easy and stress free on our wedding day. I would recommend Happy Hen Garden to everyone!

I was so blessed to find Nichole and A to Z Flowers. After a terrible experience with another floral vendor that left me shell shocked, A to Z Flowers came to our rescue with excellent service, professionalism and most importantly, simply human kindness that made planning our wedding florals easy and enjoyable. Nichole patiently kept in close contact with us over 8 months before our wedding to help create the vision, design and delivery for our event - all with no fuss and amazing value. The flowers we received were stunning, high quality, and absolutely what I had envisioned. Thank you A to Z Flowers for being a part of our special day. -Ann Nguyen - Lee

We cannot say enough wonderful things about Hillary at Wildflower Hill Floral— she truly went above and beyond to make our wedding florals absolutely stunning. She took extra care from our first meeting to work with us on our vision and bringing it to life even more beautifully than we imagined! Every arrangement—from the bouquets, corsages, boutonnieres, to the ceremony to the table centerpieces—was perfectly curated. She worked with me on the perfect bridal bouquet, featuring the women in my life through their favorite flowers. It was so above and beyond perfect, I had it specially preserved after the wedding so I have it around forever! Her expertise in nature and design, creativity, and care were evident in every arrangement. On top of that, Hillary was a joy to work with: responsive, kind, and incredibly passionate. Our guests are still talking about how gorgeous the flowers were! We’re so grateful for her talent and heart, and we would recommend her in a heartbeat to anyone! Thank you! ♡Dan&Britt

They were super easy to work with and surprised me with such a luxury tear drop bouquet. That were affordable as well.

I had the pleasure of working with Stevie from Two Poppies Floral and Vintage Rentals for my wedding, and I can't recommend her enough! Her taste is exceptional, and she truly listened to our requests, applying them beautifully to our floral arrangements. During our planning session, Stevie was open to our ideas while providing her own suggestions, and we collaboratively discussed the color palette. She adhered to our vision perfectly, and the flowers she chose were stunning, with arrangements that were expertly crafted. Communication with Stevie was fantastic; we could easily text her with questions and details. Her services were also affordable, and I appreciated that she offered cleaning as an add-on, which took one more thing off my plate. From her repertoire, we rented two A-frames and vintage furniture, creating a gorgeous setup that was perfect for photos. Overall, I highly recommend Two Poppies Floral and Vintage Rentals for anyone looking for beautiful floral arrangements and excellent service!

Robyn at Songbird Floristry created the wedding flowers of my absolute dreams! They were beyond anything I could have imagined - lush, abundant, and perfectly in line with my vision. I love that she grows so many of her own flowers, which made everything feel unique and special. Even when I asked for a few exotic blooms, she sourced them seamlessly and incorporated them beautifully! Her team also went above and beyond dropping off my bouquet and boutonnieres at our offsite getting-ready location so I didn’t have to worry about a thing. The flowers were stunning in every way and made such a huge impact on the day (and the photos!). Robyn’s artistry, attention to detail, and genuine care are unmatched. Truly worth every penny, and if you want florals that will exceed your expectations, you are in the very best hands with Songbird Floristry!!

Alicia did an amazing job. She communicated when she was going to arrive later than expected and came to the venue and spend hours setting out all the florals and making sure they were in their proper placements and even came in and showed me how to hold my flowers to make sure they were nice in all the photos. The biggest things that I need to mention is her flexibility. A couple weeks before the wedding I realized I did not order enough center pieces and she made the adjustment and delivered. I cannot thank her enough!
