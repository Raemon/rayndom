## About

_**Choosing Tyler Arboretum**_ as the location for your wedding or for a special gathering ensures a unique and unforgettable event. Set among 650 acres of rolling meadows and pristine woodlands in Media, Pennsylvania, Tyler Arboretum offers a setting unparalleled for its natural beauty, historic charm and true romance. Here, Mother Nature’s talents set the stage for breathtaking weddings held amid butterfly-filled gardens, towering trees, fields of wildflowers and centuries-old structures.

**_Tyler’s collections provide_** exquisite backdrops every season of the year. In spring, the perfume of hundreds of lilacs, magnolias, and rhododendrons fill the air, while the herb-filled Fragrant Garden comes to life in the summer sunshine. By autumn, the turning leaves of centuries-old trees steal the show. The beauty continues into winter with snow-laden branches of state-champion conifers and hollies.

_**Within the stone bank barn**_ , built circa 1833, a reception room combined with tenting over an adjacent terrace that overlooks a rolling valley of majestic trees and babbling stream can accommodate gatherings up to 200 people.

Great Value for Money

Tyler Arboretum and JAM catering create such a wonderful wedding planning experience. This venue offers a seriously impressive value for money that can’t be beat. You get so many things included in the per person pricing which takes so much financial stress out of the process! Oh and the food is incredible!

Amazing Venue!

Tyler Arboretum is a beautiful wedding venue! We worked with Coby when we got started and he gave us great recommendations, including the butterfly weekend! You have several options for where you want cocktail hour versus dinner versus dancing. They do not mandate vendors but their preferred vendors list helped narrow down our search. Dana, our wedding coordinator, was wonderful and patient. We are looking forward to our August 3rd wedding!

JAM Catering + Tyler Arboretum The Best Duo

Our experience with Coby at the Tyler Arboretum was exceptional. Within minutes of arriving on the property, Coby's deep knowledge and passion for the venue were evident. He effortlessly highlighted the beauty and potential of the arboretum, making it easy for us to envision our event there. Despite visiting in January, Coby vividly painted a picture of what it would be like in August. Coupled with JAM Catering's detailed look books, the planning process became not only seamless but also incredibly enjoyable.  
  
JAM Catering truly excels in personalizing their services to meet the unique needs of each couple. They go above and beyond to ensure that the menu is flawlessly tailored and meticulously curated. With a wide array of options for each course, they are also incredibly attentive to allergies, making their offerings both diverse and considerate.

Gorgeous Natural Location for a Wedding!

Tyler Arboretum is such an amazingly beautiful venue to have a wedding. We had our ceremony outside and had virtually no decorations as it was not needed in such a beautiful setting. The barn provided such a beautiful indoor setting for our reception, and for our group of around 100 it was the perfect size for everyone to eat, dance, and mingle comfortably. I couldn’t be happier that we chose this location for our wedding and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a similar setting!

Tyler Arboretum was a dream wedding venue

Tyler Arboretum is a magically beautiful place and my husband and I are so grateful that we were lucky enough to get married here. We knew we were in good hands with the JAM catering team -- everyone we worked with there was responsive and seemed truly invested in making our day everything we hoped it would be. The food was delicious and our guests had a great experience!  
  
My now husband and I loved that Tyler had so many different spaces to choose from for different aspects of our wedding. We also appreciated that the barn and tent made it so that we could still have a beautiful wedding even if we had to execute a rain plan. We ended up getting married outside in a light rain and then having our cocktails + dinner under the tent and dancing + dessert in the barn. For anyone worried about the venue being spread out, they provided golf carts for my grandparents who had challenges with mobility and someone from the JAM team was always ready to help anyone in need of assistance. It was a truly magical experience and our guests raved about the wedding -- I would absolutely recommend Tyler to anyone looking for an unforgettable wedding venue!

Dream wedding!

My husband and I got married at Tyler on 12/4/21 and it was the most beautiful day. Everything we envisioned and more. Gorgeous venue and Lindsay and her team were great in making sure all of the details and decor came together. All of our vendors (recommended by JAM caterers) were excellent. The food was outstanding...guests commented (and I agreed!) it was the best wedding food they'd ever had. I really did not worry about anything the day of the wedding...the crew at Tyler handled everything so smoothly. Really very happy and grateful for such a special day to start our marriage.
