We had the absolute pleasure of hiring Belize Catering Company for four events for our destination wedding in Belize! Right from the pre-wedding planning phase, Vanessa was an absolute gem. Her responsiveness was unparalleled, even for a stressed out bride! No matter how last-minute our requests were, she was there to address all our questions/thoughts. Working with her to customize our menus was a breeze, thanks to her insightful suggestions. Vanessa even helped me in arranging some day-of surprises for my husband, even though I texted her at 1am the night before (literally 6 hours before she was to arrive). This level of dedication truly set her and BCC apart from the rest of the vendors. When we arrived in Belize, Vanessa came to the venue to meet us and to make sure we had all of our questions answered. She walked the property with us and gave her expert insight as to where we should have the chefs cook, where the buffet and bar should be, and just the overall layout to ensure our guests had a great time! Now, let's talk food. It was a delicious feast from our breakfast events, to welcome apps to our wedding dinner-- and our guests are still going on about it! Seriously, top meals of the entire trip. And the chefs and staff? Total rockstars. Not only were they skilled, but they were also a hilarious. They truly brought the happy go-lucky Belize vibe to our wedding, despite it the massive rainstorm outside! Oh, and the bartender? Island's best, hands down. We asked for passion fruit margaritas and mai tais as our signature drinks, and this guy went all out, creating his own mixers to make sure they were the best of the best. The drinks and they were made to perfection each time, for the entire night! Unfortunately, we didn't capture any pictures as everything was devoured in record time. Belize Catering Company and its crew are the real deal. We can't recommend them enough. Honestly, if we could rewind and get married again, we'd do it just for the food!
