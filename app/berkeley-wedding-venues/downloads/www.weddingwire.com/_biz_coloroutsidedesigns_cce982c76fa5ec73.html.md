best bridal shower

I’m honestly still not over how amazing my bridal shower was. Everything felt so thoughtful and so me, and I felt celebrated the entire day. And my bride jacket?? I never took it off. The second I put it on I was like yep, this is it — instant bride energy. Between the decor, the games, and all the little personal touches, it was just one of those days that felt easy, happy, and full of love

The perfect bachelorette detail we didn’t know we needed

Sarah (coloroutsidedesigns) created the cutest custom slippers for our bachelorette weekend, and they ended up being one of everyone’s favorite parts of the entire celebration. They were perfect for getting ready, hanging out together, and honestly just made the whole weekend feel extra special.  
  
The customization was spot on, the quality was amazing, and everything felt thoughtfully made—not rushed or generic. Communication was easy and stress-free, which made a huge difference while planning.  
  
It was one of those details that brought everyone together and made the experience feel intentional and fun. I would absolutely recommend coloroutsidedesigns for bachelorette parties or day-of wedding details if you want something personal and memorable.

The easiest and most thoughtful part of our wedding

Working with Sarah was such a great experience from start to finish. Communication was easy, thoughtful, and stress-free, which is HUGE when you’re planning a wedding.  
  
Everything was customized exactly how we wanted, and you can truly tell how much care goes into each piece. The quality was amazing, the designs were beautiful, and it added such a personal touch to our day.  
  
It felt really special knowing everything was handmade and not mass-produced. Pricing felt fair for the level of customization and detail, and the entire process was smooth and professional.  
  
I would absolutely recommend coloroutsidedesigns to any couple looking for meaningful, one-of-a-kind details that actually feel personal!!
