Ardenwood Farms was a beautiful venue for our wedding in September- perfect weather, the grounds were well maintained and there were even baby peacocks! But what set this venue apart for my husband and I was the dream team that made our wedding so seamless. Claire, Stephanie and Lindsey are not only incredibly sweet, responsive and organized, but they executed our day to perfection. They somehow managed to keep all the details straight, even when I changed my mind several times. They even went through the buffet line and brought the food to us so we could have a chance to sit and eat! The venue even makes it simple with so many aspects that you can rent: table numbers, heaters, lawn games, etc. It made wedding planning significantly less stressful, and they are happy to make recommendations when you get stuck. I could not recommend this venue more! Everyone raved about how perfect it was.
