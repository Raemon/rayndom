The best wedding paper products ever!

Kathy’s work is absolutely amazing! Truly blown away by her artistic ability and expertise. Our invitation suites feel like a true work of art, and so do our menus, programs, and name place-cards. Kathy was so great to work with - incredibly responsive and has such a good eye for design. Her studio is so cute and it was so fun to go into the shop and see all the different types of paper, design ideas, etc and then create paper products that helped set the tone for our wedding! Could not be happier with how all of our wedding paper turned out. Would highly recommend!

Absolutely the best

We met with Kathy and she patiently walked us through options to personalize our invitations and also make some custom signs for our day. Everything was professional, on time, and beautiful.

I loved all my wedding stationary!

I am so happy to have worked with Posh Paper for my wedding stationary. Kathy brought my stationary dreams come to life on paper! She was so intentional and worked with me to make my invitations and day of stationary classy but unique. She is great at what she does!

Posh paper did an absolutely amazing job for all the details of my wedding! Kathy was so great to work with and she really took the time to see my vision and turn it into something beautiful, exactly and precisely what I wanted. My wedding guests noticed the detailed wedding programs, place cards and menus and I received a lot of wonderful comments about them. They were very affordable and completely worth it! I was so impressed and still enjoy looking back at the pictures of how lovely they turned out. I can’t thank Posh Paper enough for the beautiful job they’ve done for me!
