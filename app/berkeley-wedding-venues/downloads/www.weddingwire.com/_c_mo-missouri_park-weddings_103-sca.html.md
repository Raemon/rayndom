It was a great experience from start to finish. They listened to our needs, and made it all happen! The venue was gorgeous, the staff were all professional and friendly. The food was delicious! Everything was smooth from our first tour, through the rehearsals, and on to the final sparkler exit. Shout out to Danah who was AMAZING on the day-of. We highly recommend.

We had plans to elope elsewhere in Arkansas and had to pivot last minute. Ernie was SO responsive and helpful, and the venue was absolutely perfect for what we were hoping to find. Subtle and beautiful, you could really do so many things with the space. I can’t say how perfect everything was!

We had our wedding ceremony at Dogwood Canyon in Lampe, MO, and it was truly everything we hoped for and more. The atmosphere is absolutely breathtaking — surrounded by nature, with pristine landscapes that make for unforgettable scenery and photos. From start to finish, the venue was spotless, well-maintained, and thoughtfully equipped with all the amenities we needed. One of the biggest highlights was the incredible staff. Everyone we interacted with was warm, professional, and helpful. A special shoutout to Tracy and her team, who went above and beyond — Tracy was knowledgeable, responsive, and genuinely kind throughout the entire planning process. Her guidance and calm presence made everything so much easier. If you’re looking for a nature-inspired, well-run, and stunningly beautiful place to get married, I can’t recommend Dogwood Canyon enough. It’s a magical setting that you and your guests will remember forever.

What a wonderful venue! If you want that rustic shabby sheik wedding, this is the place! All the people are wonderful to work with. It was a perfect day to get married right out on the point next to the Mississippi River. There isn't one thing we would have changed. Thanks to everyone who put in so much time to make this wedding so beautiful and memorable!

This venue is beautiful all on its own. We had an arch with stumps and table decor but that’s all that was needed! The venue is rustic yet elegant and absolutely stunning! Laura is fantastic to work with!!

Highly highly highly recommend. We did our wedding on a Wednesday and it cost us $1400 for wednesday and tuesday. Weekends are more expensive but still affordable ($3000?) He was so friendly and helpful. He answered all of our questions and allowed us to tour on 3 different occasions with different people. Our best man is paralyzed. He built a ramp specifically for him so it was more accessible. It was so beautiful and there are so many places to have your ceremony it'll fit any wedding.
