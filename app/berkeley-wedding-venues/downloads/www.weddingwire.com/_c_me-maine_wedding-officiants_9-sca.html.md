I had the pleasure of having Julie marry my husband Michael and I this August and it went perfectly. The months leading up to the wedding we had a call with Julie and instantly felt at ease and confident that Julie was the right person to help us say I do! She had a whole packet that guided my husband and I into choosing the readings that would work for our dream ceremony. The rehearsal the night before went so smoothly as she walked Michael and I through the ins and outs of the ceremony, then guided our family and friends through our ceremony. The ceremony went absolutely perfectly Julie was so well spoken and put together the most special and sincere wedding. Thank you Julie for the most perfect wedding and making my dreams come true!

Liam was so responsive, personable, and attentive to our needs for our big day! Tailored such an amazing ceremony for us and his rates can’t be beat. We’re so glad we found him for our wedding. Definitely would recommend Knot and Tide to anyone!

Sherri was our officiant for our wedding on 10/11/25. From the very beginning Sherri was so warm and welcoming. She listened with curiosity to our ideas and even helped us form a better idea of what we were looking for in a customized ceremony. It was really important for us to include our dog in our ceremony and Sherri was not only understanding, but she was so excited to help us figure out ways to include him. We were beyond impressed with her work and time that she put into crafting our love story to be shared on our wedding day. We filled out detailed questionnaires about our relationship from beginning to what lead us to marriage. She was able to take pieces from each of our questionnaires and create a story that we will cherish forever. Not only is Sherri warm, welcoming, and creative but she is also very communicative with her clients. We were able to message Sherri whenever we had a thought pop into our heads and she would get back to us in a timely manner. She provided us with copies of the ceremony script so we could review and change things as needed. I couldn’t recommend her work more to anyone looking for a sentimental and truly unique ceremony. Thank you so much Sherri for the amazing work you did to help us create a ceremony that was truly our own!

Gwen was very quick and flexible when it came to communication, she responded to all message with in the same day if not the same hour. She was very flexible when it came to timing or adjusting things to our needs. The day was beautiful and Gwen certainly helped to make that happen. Highly recommended Gwen is a pleasure to work with!

Anna made our wedding experience unforgettable! She got to know us through questionnaires and Zoom meetings since we were out of state, and really was able to personalize our wedding ceremony so that it reflected our values, personalities and bond. It was the most amazing experience and we couldn't have chosen a better officiant. She was warm, inviting, attentive and efficient throughout the entire process.

Reverend Erika was a perfect choice for our wedding! Right away she made us feel cared for, calm, and loved. This continued and grew with every step of the way, through our big day, and even afterwards! She was an absolute joy to work with. Erika really gets to know who both of you are, makes sure to include all of your preferences and aspirations, and will work with you so that each and every part of the ceremony fits exactly what you’re both looking for. She creates a very unique and special ceremony and goes out of her way to make sure that it’s the wedding that you’ve always dreamed about. Alongside with everything being perfect, Erika just glows with good vibes, happiness and love. We could not have been happier!

Choosing a wedding officiant is a big deal -- they set the tone for the whole wedding -- and I am so glad that we chose Jill Allen! Jill helped us to create a ceremony that was uniquely ours, providing us with a basic framework and lots of ideas, but then letting us run with our own ideas (like incorporating an "ocean ceremony" since my husband and I are from opposite coasts). She calmed everyone's nerves at the rehearsal, had treats for the flower boy, reminded our moms to sign the marriage certificate, answered my umpteen emails and questions, looked professional and happy, gave my husband cute ideas (like kissing my hand as we walked back down the aisle -- favorite photo of the day!), and was just one of those women that you'd like to be friends with! I would HIGHLY recommend Jill Allen and Southern Maine Ceremonies for your wedding. She was a true highlight of our big day!

Our wedding ceremony turned out so perfect! Andrea was recommended to us by our wedding planner, and she was simply amazing. She got back to us quickly, and you gave us all the tools that we needed to make the ceremony go smoothly! We had plenty of styles, quotes, short readings, ceremony ideas, ring ceremony wording ideas, and vows to read through. We had all the information we ever needed on obtaining our marriage license. I was very nervous to stand up in front of a bunch of people, but she was there to support us and guide us through the ceremony. Thank you again, Andrea, for making our wedding day so special!

Dan was helpful, knowledgeable, flexible and efficient. Dan was available both the day and two days before the ceremony at any time we needed him to be there for the rehearsal. We had planned out 2 readings but when the day came, in 90+ degree weather, Dan noticed how we were fairing in the weather and cut it a little short so we could get cooled down without jeopardizing the integrity of the ceremony. He seemed genuinely happy to be at our ceremony officiating for us.
