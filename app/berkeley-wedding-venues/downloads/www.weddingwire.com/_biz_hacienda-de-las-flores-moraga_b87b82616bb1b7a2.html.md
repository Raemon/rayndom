Amazing Experience!

I would definitely recommend this venue. The staff was super sweet, always responded super quickly (sometimes at night too!) and were super great about making sure we were on track with deadlines. They recommended us bakeries and DJ services, so the planning process was a lot more streamlined and less stress for us. Chrissy was absolutely amazing as a coordinator, she was open to whatever we wanted and made sure we had the best wedding possible. We had an absolutely amazing wedding, food was great and all the Wedgewood recommended vendors were great. Definitely recommend!!

Beautiful Venue

My husband and I fell in love with this venue the first time we visited. Stephanie Thach, our wedding coordinator, was so wonderful to work with. She was really organized and responsive in communicating with us regarding all the planning details of our wedding. She was very engaged and enthusiastic which made the process really enjoyable and stress free! The venue itself is magical and so unique to all of the venues we considered for our big day.

Best Venue for my Wedding 

Hacienda de las Flores by Wedgewood Weddings was incredible. The moment my now husband and I saw it, we knew it was the one for us. The landscape is beautiful, the historic buildings, the tall trees, everything was everything I ever envision.   
  
The Wedgewood Weddings experience was just amazing. The process was so easy and stress-free that I will recommend them to all my family members and friends.

If You Love Historic Venues ...

If you love historic venues, you must check out Hacienda de las Flores! We ended up choosing something closer to home, but we loved it all the same. When you drive up, you realize it's a really secluded park with towering trees and beautiful architectural buildings. The amphitheater makes for such a cool ceremony and the outdoor lawn is just stunning when it's all set up for an event. The team was happy to tour us around every nook and cranny - and we even took time to hike some of the trails. It's just beautiful.

Best Day Ever!

My husband and I got married at Hacienda De La Flores in the fall of 2023, and I couldn't recommend it more. From the team to the venue itself, everything was beautiful and seamless. They helped me from the beginning with planning and making big decisions. I worked with a few different planners and they were all wonderful and attentive. I couldn't have asked for a better coordinator. She kept my wedding day nerves at bay, and I knew I could count on her to get all my décor set up just the way I wanted. The venue itself was gorgeous and exactly what I dreamed of. We had the best day ever!!

Gorgeous, scenic venue

When my partner and I were looking for a wedding venue, we knew we wanted something that felt special but not overly formal or stuffy. Hacienda de las Flores turned out to be perfect - it's in a beautiful park-like setting with lush gardens, fountains, and graceful archways that made for gorgeous photo backdrops.  
  
Despite the elegant surroundings, the vibe is relaxed and comfortable. The on-site coordinator and her team are complete pros who helped everything run smoothly without ever being pushy or inflexible. They were able to adapt to our more casual style with ease.  
  
Our guests are still raving about the food! Everything was fresh, flavorful and beautifully presented.  
  
This is a great venue that is scenic yet private, elegant but not pretentious. The coordinators help it feel like your event, not just a cookie cutter wedding. From start to finish, our experience working with them was personalized and stress-free - exactly what you need on your wedding day!

Flawless Day at Hacienda

I had my wedding at Wedgewood Hacienda Spring 2023, and couldn’t have picked a better venue and place to have it at. Main points: Beautiful venue, Great service, and friendly staff. For a bride, it all went so smoothly, they were so great through the whole planning process, made it super easy to put the event together. I was never a big wedding person, so I was nervous about what kind of stress it would take to plan a wedding in the Bay Area, but Wedgewood guided us through all of it and I can’t recommend them enough if you want a pain-free wedding planning experience. There are still PLENTY of decisions to make and ways to customize, but they really help take care of all the logistics. The day-of coordination with Sarah was flawless. I had not a single worry day of and we felt so taken care of. She kept everything moving and perfectly on schedule. The venue itself is gorgeous and I couldn’t stop getting compliments from friends and family. Every single point of contact/vendor through Wedgewood was a gem, we loved our DJ & Photo Booth attendant through imobile and added on some additional vendors that they recommended. I was a little worried about the noise ordinance and having the dance floor indoors, but it turned out wonderfully for me, I like having the separate dance space and the music was bumping, we danced hard! The team at Wedgewood always went above and beyond whenever we met or I had random questions/requests, and really made my wedding special. I couldn’t have asked for a better day and wedding planning process with the Wedgewood team at Hacienda!

Beautiful venue, great planners, delicious food

The Hacienda, and the Wedgewood team, are individually fantastic, and combined, made our wedding very special. The venue itself is gorgeous if you like stately, romantic, beautiful grounds. The Wedgewood team, especially Chrissy, whom we worked with directly, made it really easy and low-stress to plan things. Their partner vendors are also fantastic - we had a delicious and beautiful cake from Danville Bakery, and Val with A Love's In Bloom prepared and arranged absolutely stunning florals.

December Wedding

We loved Hacienda de las Flores! They really brought our dream wedding to life. Sarah, the event coordinator, was organized and punctual, and the banquet captain, James, was super helpful for the remainder of the night after she had to leave. All of the service staff was great (I wished I had gotten/remembered their names, but it was such a fast-paced night) and I want to give them a special shout-out for making my family feel so comfortable, conversing with our guests, and even hyping us up on the dance floor!   
  
An even more special shout-out has to go to the DJ, Mike, or DJ MaveWave. He made the night SO fun. Our guests couldn't leave the dance floor and stayed until the very end! He took the playlist I gave him and made it a masterpiece and so balanced! Also, the photo booth coordinator, Leo, was so nice and made everyone feel so at ease. Both of our families are Filipino, and so is he, so he had some awesome cultural props for us to use that our families for a huge kick out of. There were a few hiccups. For example, we paid for the package that came with an open bar for beer, wine, and well liquors. However, the bartender that night (I didn't get her name) was charging my guests for small sodas to chase their shots of alcohol, some of my guests got charged for wine and beer while others didn't, and the ones that did get charged were getting charged with inconsistent prices throughout the night. People came expecting to be able to enjoy drinks on us, but that wasn't the case and many people were very confused. As the bride and groom, this wasn't exactly a fire we wanted to have to put out on our special day, but we were getting comments left and right about this. I asked about this and she (the bartender) said that yes, beer, wine, and well liquors are free, but when I mentioned what was happening, she implied that my guests were mistaken with their orders and did in fact order other things that they had to be charged for. That didn't seem the case when I spoke to people, but it was a minor inconvenience to an otherwise perfect night that ran so smoothly. In the end, people didn't mind paying here and there to have a good time, it just wasn't what we had expected to happen. By the end of the night, our guests had nothing but positive things to say about the venue and how beautiful and hospitable the staff was.   
  
Clean-up at the end was also a breeze. The staff had all of our personal decor cleaned up and packed with care, ready for us to take home. All in all, I thought the night was magical and the venue played a really big part in that. Personally, as a bride, I expected to be pulled left and right by the staff to keep on schedule, but I was rarely pulled aside or bothered. Everything just happened naturally and I was able to spend the time with our guests that I wanted to.   
  
Edit: 1/15/23-This is in addition to my first review on 12/25/22. I was finally able to get the names of all of the staff who helped us and wanted to shout them out personally for making this an amazing day.  
  
Coordinator: Sarah  
Banquet Captain: James  
Banquet Staff: Jenn, Jane, Kinzy, and Telitha   
Chef: Vince  
Florist: A Loves in Bloom  
DJ and Photobooth: iMobile Djs (Mike and Leo)  
Cake: Old Towne Danville Bakery  
  
I would recommend any of the vendors they use and of course, book your special day here. My previous review is more detailed, but the staff deserves individual mentions for their great service. We had so much fun. My family cannot stop raving about the night and the venue and staff!

Hacienda de las Flores (pre Wedgewood management) is incredible!

I'm saddened to see that Hacienda de las Flores is being taken over by Wedgewood. I'm sure it's going to be more expensive and less flexible but it doesn't change the beauty of the venue. When we booked it, it was still being managed by the Town of Morage and its rates were incredibly reasonable (even cheaper if you're a resident). There were no exclusive vendors, meaning we could use any caterer we wanted, which was key to keeping costs down. Jasmine Bateson was our contact and she was responsive and professional every step of the way.   
  
Our wedding, like many others, was postponed due to COVID and luckily for us, the Town only booked weddings 12 months out so we were able to get the same Saturday one year later. We rented the Pavilion for our ceremony and the Hacienda for our reception and both are stunning. There is tons of included parking, several getting ready areas in doors, plenty of restrooms, and a full commercial kitchen. The only negative is that the neighbors are so close and we had to keep the music very low.   
  
We couldn't have asked for a better venue! Unfortunately, with Wedgewood in place, the experience will likely be much more corporate and expensive.
