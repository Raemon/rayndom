My husband and I hired Faro and his team to help us plan our wedding in under 6 months due to having to cancel our destination wedding and move it to NYC. C & L’s team made sure we put our covid-wedding blues behind us and got to work right away. They helped us find all the perfect vendors, designed the whole event, and ensured all would go according to plan. We rented an empty loft space in Greenpoint with great bones but needed a lot of TLC to come to life. Faro and his team transformed the industrial factory into a magical haven for wedding bliss. We have not stopped getting phone calls, texts and and emails from friends and family raving about our wedding - from layout, to decor, to florals, to food and everything in between. If you are looking for a wedding team that takes pride in their work and in knowing you can sit back and enjoy your event, We highly recommend C & L for any of your upcoming events!

I had found Dalmazio Design through social media and first used them for my engagement party. They were professional, punctual, had great communication and amazing taste! My party turned out to be a dream come true, therefore it was a no brained that I used them for my bridal shower as well (keep in mind that they helped me plan my bridal shower in one month on short notice). HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

My husband and I got married in September 2025 and we hired WPP in Spring 2024. From the first meeting with Shannon, we immediately knew WPP was the right fit for us. We did have an unfortunate situation about 6 months into the early planning, where our original wedding planner decided to leave however, this was truly a blessing in disguise because we ended up getting Eliza as our new wedding planner. Eliza was the perfect fit for us. She is the best there is and we are honestly so lucky with how the situation turned out! She truly listened to everything we said, was a great and efficient communicator, made sure we were on top of deadlines, and was a genuine sweetheart throughout the whole wedding planning process. Alissa, the assistant event planner, was also there every step of the way and was so on top of everything. A major powerhouse that WPP has, is the amazing Margette. Margette is a genius and I still cannot believe how incredible she was able to create our wedding space based off my crazy concepts. I feel like she read my mind and always had a solution to everything. Our decor was beyond what I ever could have imagined and for probably more than half the price of what a lot of other people spend. Every wedding deserves a Margette, Eliza, Alissa, and Shannon! I seriously miss my monthly meetings with Eliza and I genuinely feel like the WPP ladies are our friends now.

First of all, thanks James for making our wedding weekend the best one of our lives. We did not have any last-minute stressful situations thanks to James’s great attention to detail and organization skills. Though, judging by his diligence throughout our planning process, I am sure he would have solved any problem smoothly had the need arisen. James did a seamless job working with a multitude of vendors and helping us manage our budget (including renegotiating rates) to make room for more fun surprises during our wedding day. James always brought good ideas/vendors to the table, and he was open to work with new vendors to achieve the identity we wanted to imprint in our celebrations. The night of the wedding reception, James was nothing short of a general that managed a platoon of people make our dream night come to life. We highly recommend working with James to anyone planning a wedding celebration.

Where do I even begin…first off, when it comes to a wedding planner, look no further!! There is no comparison (and trust me when I say…I did my due diligence and vet almost every wedding planner in the industry) when it comes to the level of expertise, knowledge and perseverance of Sonal and her amazing team!! A little over a week ago, our dreams came true. Actually, what happened last week far surpassed what our wildest dreams could have ever even imagined. Sonal and Ginny, having you by our side was hands down the best decision we made. The unbelievable magic that took place last week has been the talk of the town and every single guest that attended. We had a very large destination wedding and literally everyday since we got back, we are getting HUNDREDS of messages of being blown away from the experience and the meticulous and perfect planning from our guests but also from people who were watching via peoples posts and stories all over social media. We have complete strangers reaching out to us saying they were blown away by everything as they watched stories being posted online. Every single person has thanked us over and over again for giving them an experience they have never had and probably never will again. We have people begging us to have a vow renewal (every year) so they can experience similar events again. Every single one of our guests have made comments on the planning and execution of every event and took notice of every single detail. We were blessed with rain (yes, I love rain that much) on our wedding day but you can imagine the chaos this creates with everything when this happens. The seamless step in and step up when all things could have gone wrong was impeccable. You know it was an amazing weekend when not just us as the bride and groom and our families are dealing with post wedding blues but almost everyone who attended has reached out to us saying how much fun they had and how indescribable the experience was that coming back home has nothing short of sucked and there is a level of sadness everyone has that it’s over. We are so thankful for you and all of the SJS Angels for making our wedding one for the books. It will be talked about for ages and it most definitely was the wedding of a lifetime!! Sonal, Ginny….you are a gift to this industry. You are fierce strong women who leave countless impacts on peoples lives. Single-handedly, this industry is a better place because of you two!! There is NO BETTER TEAM in this industry to make your wedding dreams come true!! You are a force to be reckoned with!! Thank you will never be enough for all did 💙 you will forever have a place in our hearts!!

Lauren is intelligent, efficient, and amazing to work with. She works hard and is very good at her job. We elected the month of option and to have Lauren and her assistant present on the day of the wedding. My husband and I were stumbling and unsure where to start with formulating a timeline - after one meeting, Lauren structured one without any hesitation, and patiently worked with us through our questions and any confusion we had. Lauren also made sure she was available when we needed her, even at odd hours. On the day of, Lauren put out fires before we even realized there were fires! She made our day so much less stressful considering there were a handful of fires at no fault of her own nor my husband and I (namely the venue and one of the other vendors). Lauren goes above and beyond, and it is clear that she genuinely cares about her clients and works hard to ensure that their wedding day will be the best day of their lives, aka no stress nor issues on them. Lauren was one of the best decisions we made during the wedding planning process. We were unsure to book a coordinator initially, and looking back now, we are so relieved and glad that we had Lauren during the process and the day of. Lauren is truly the best out there. I highly, highly recommend Lauren, and will continue recommending her to anyone who asks if they need a coordinator (you do - you need Lauren)!

Michelle and her team were honestly so superb I don’t have any words for how perfect everything was. Seriously cannot imagine the process of planning a wedding without her and I loved working with her team. Shout out to Claire who was with me all day!!! She was fantastic and so helpful. The venue looked absolutely stunning and the florals were perfect. I cannot recommend this team enough. They are a must book!!

Cindy was absolutely amazing and worth her weight in gold!! She made herself available and was very responsive leading up to the wedding, answering all of our random questions and easing any apprehensions that arose. She has a calming presence, provides helpful guidance, and is very organized, so you feel like you're in good hands. On the day of our wedding, we expected some light rain but there was a torrential downpour right before our outdoor ceremony. Cindy kept us grounded and handled everything behind the scenes to quickly move our ceremony indoors and to still make our outdoor reception/vision a reality after it stopped raining. I'm sure there was a lot of quick thinking and directing involved, and we're so grateful that we had Cindy and Carol there to manage it all for us. I can't imagine our wedding day going as smoothly as it did without her! Thank you so much, Cindy and Carol!

Working with Debra was the best decision we made throughout our wedding planning. My brother and sister-in-law worked with her for their wedding in the winter of 2020. Seeing how easy and seamless she made everything, I knew I wanted to work with her as well. She really took the time to get to know us and understand what our wedding vision was. We were in constant communication, and she made the entire process so fun and easy. We really couldn't have kept everything on track without her, especially our budget which we were able to stick to. She handled all of the vendors, and everything we didn't even think of. Her wedding staff on the day of was amazing. We worked with Lorraine and Davonne and both kept us sane, on track, and so so happy. Debra becomes your family and there is no one better to work with when planning such an important day.
