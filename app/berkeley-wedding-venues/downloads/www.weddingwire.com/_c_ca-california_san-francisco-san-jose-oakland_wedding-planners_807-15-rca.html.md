## How much does a wedding planner cost?

A wedding planner can be an [absolute lifesaver](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-reasons-your-wedding-planner-is-a-total-lifesaver) for busy couples, ensuring that the planning process and actual event run smoothly. As a professional who’s been through the process before, they can also offer countless wedding planning recommendations and tips. It’s important to know wedding planning is not a one size fits all service - your wedding vision is unique and a wedding planner will customize their offering to fit your needs. Because of this and the wide range of services these professionals provide, pricing varies widely with most couples in the U.S. spending at least $1,500 on wedding planner services for their big day. Wedding planner costs also differ based on the planner’s level of expertise, among many other factors, as more experienced pros typically come with a higher price tag (and with that comes top-tier service!).

  * __ $ 675 or less Lower range
  * __ $ 1,800  Average cost
  * __ $ 1,200 - $ 2,800  Most couples spend between
  * __ $ 4,500 or more Upper range



Costs displayed are based on spend from thousands of couples who recently reported pricing for this service within their WeddingWire review. Pricing varies based on factors including, but not limited to, vendor’s experience, level of expertise, event guest count, date, and geographic region.

What services does a wedding planner's fee include?

__

The services a wedding planner’s cost includes vary depending on the [type of professional you’re hiring](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/the-7-types-of-wedding-planners-and-what-they-do) — whether it’s a full-service, month-of, or day-of planner, or a planner who specializes in [destination weddings](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/destination-weddings--t8). Here are [some of the most common services that your wedding planner may include](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/why-a-wedding-planner-costs-that-much) in his or her package:

  * Correspondence: About 30 percent of a wedding planner’s time is spent communicating with you and your vendors via email and phone. Think of your planner as the “coach” of your vendor team who ensures that all of your wedding pros work together well—and frequent communication is a huge part of that.
  * Venue and vendor selection: Your planner likely has a lot of connections in the wedding industry and can help you pick the right [venue](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-venues) and vendors that can help bring your wedding vision to life. Often, your planner will attend interviews and meetings with you and your vendors, too.
  * Organization: A big part of wedding planning is... paperwork? Yes, unfortunately it’s true. But wedding planners can make sure that all of your budgets, contracts, timelines, etc. are properly organized and easily accessible if needed.
  * Wedding prep: There are lots of seemingly small tasks that go into creating your perfect day both before and on the day-of from creating a [wedding-day timeline](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-timeline), assembling invitations, setting up your favor display, assisting with your [seating chart](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-create-your-wedding-seating-chart), and much more.
  * Day-of coordination: You might not see your wedding planner much on the day of your wedding—and that’s how it should be! Your planner will arrive long before your ceremony begins and stay well afterwards, making sure that everything runs on-time and smoothly from behind-the-scenes and [any issues are handled](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-fiascos-and-how-wedding-planners-solved-them) quickly and quietly so that you and your new spouse can enjoy the day, stress-free!
  * Post-wedding tasks: There will likely be several important tasks to handle after the wedding, from ensuring clean-up and breakdown occur properly to returning rental items and making sure vendors receive their tips.



What wedding events does a planner's fee cover?

__

In most cases, a wedding planner will assist with the wedding itself—both ceremony and reception. However, if you are able to increase your wedding planning budget and costs, your planner can also help plan your rehearsal dinner and post-wedding brunch. If you’re having a destination wedding with lots of events over the course of the weekend, your planner may assist with those as well—but expect to pay more. 

How much does a day-of wedding planner cost?

__

A day-of wedding planner isn’t heavily involved in the wedding planning process and is usually hired closer to the wedding, but has a big role to play on the wedding day, ensuring that the events run on time and everything is running smoothly. On average, the starting cost for a day-of wedding planner in the U.S. is $800 with starting rates for higher-end planners averaging $1,250 to $3,395. 

How much does a partial wedding planner cost?

__

A partial wedding planner usually comes on board a month or so before the wedding day and assists with last-minute tasks—helping with the seating chart, confirming vendors, and day-of responsibilities. The average starting rate for a partial wedding planner in the U.S. comes in at $1,250, but can range from $2,300 to $6,000 if you’re working with a more experienced pro. 

How much does a full wedding planner cost?

__

A full wedding planner helps to plan your wedding from start to finish and is usually hired early on in the planning process—at least 10 months in advance. The average starting rate for a full service wedding planner in the U.S is about $3,000 with top-tier planners averaging $4,500 to $12,000.

Cierra was incredible to work with and made our wedding day run so smoothly. She was super responsive and met with us over Zoom multiple times (and once in person) to make sure every detail was covered. She had the answer to all of our questions and helped build the most detailed wedding timeline — down to the minute — so everything stayed perfectly on track. Our rehearsal went seamlessly with her guidance on how to walk and even how parents should hold arms. On the wedding day, everything flowed beautifully. I was nervous to walk down the aisle, but Cierra reassured me and helped calm my anxiety. The reception looked stunning, she helped bustle my dress with ease, and at the end of the night, she packed everything up neatly for us to pick up later. I couldn’t have asked for a better coordinator!

We cannot speak more highly of Jessica and Tania from Castle Ever After! They helped us every step of the way from our first meeting to our wedding day. Every detail was incredibly thought-out and made the planning process so much easier for us. Having our Zoom meetings with Tania felt like catching up with a good friend, we could always count on her to have our backs! Especially on the wedding day, they made sure we were well taken care of but also having a great time with our loved ones. Thank you so much!

Our wedding planner was an absolute lifesaver! The venue attempted to change the location of our reception just five weeks before the wedding. She immediately led the charge to make sure the venue honored our contract, advocating for us every step of the way. Throughout the entire planning process, she went above and beyond, always having our backs and fighting for us when needed. Her dedication and attention to detail kept everything running smoothly, handling every challenge flawlessly. We truly couldn’t be happier with her support and would recommend her wholeheartedly to anyone planning their special day

Valerie and Nicole (sisters) were essential for our day-of-coordination! We got married in San Francisco at the Conservatory of Flowers on April 15, 2023. Nicole was busy for the day-of, but kept us on track with a wonderful spreadsheet, and helped us check over vendor logistics and contact information ahead of time. On the day-of, Valerie did a great job corresponding with vendors and making sure our amenities and decor looked beautiful. When we gave her the instructions to "do with the extra flowers/greenery runners as you see fit", Valerie made a beautiful and exceeded all our expectations! I think the only regret for me is not leaning on Valerie a bit more for herding our groomsmen and bridesmaids for some photos and smaller tasks, given how capable she was. Their pricing was also very reasonable. I'd highly recommend them for your wedding as well!

Ana is the modern day J Lo (from the wedding planner). She is meticulous, punctual, organized, professional, sharp, caring, and confident. From the moment we started working together, she made contact with our established vendors and then helped us make additional connections through her trusted vendors. And from the moment those vendors arrived on the day, she was there coordinating and organizing everything until the last vendor and guest was gone. Throughout our time together, she used a system to track our progress and help us stay within budget. She felt like family from the beginning and became a family member by the end. She made our wedding day extraordinary.

We are so glad that we hired 2 Friends Events to be our month-of coordinator for our wedding this October! Although it sounds cliche, we truly could not have done it without them. 2 Friends Events provided us with a list of reputable vendors for varying budgets, and even after hours of doing our own research, we wound up using almost exclusively the vendors on their list. They also provided us with budgeting tools, a planning checklist, a timeline, rental checklist, photoshoot list, and more! From the first call that we had, Jessica proved knowledgeable and passionate about helping us make our wedding everything that we wanted. She was friendly, communicated clearly, and asked us questions that we had no idea would need answering. As our date quickly approached, Jessica was quick to respond to anything that we threw at her, took care of the other vendor’s requested spreadsheets and timelines, and locked down an extremely detailed timeline for the day (down to 5 minutes!). She also guided us through our rehearsal the day before the wedding, and made the wedding day itself surprisingly stress free while keeping us on the prepared timeline by handling every detail and hiccup that came up - which I’m sure there were a few, even though we never heard about them! Throughout the entire process, Jessica and 2 Friends Events demonstrated spectacular attention to detail, planning skills, flexibility, and problem solving. If you’re looking for a wedding coordinator who is dedicated, organized, responsive, and committed to making your event as perfect as possible, look no further. 2 Friends Events is what you need!

Christine is BY FAR the most organized human being we have ever encountered! If you (and you DEFINITELY should) hire her as your event coordinator for your event, you will not be disappointed. We had Christine coordinate our wedding, which normally would be such a stressful planning period. However, with Christine's help, the entire process was fun, low-stress and so easy. Christine recommended vendors whenever we were in need, came up with amazing ideas for our wedding, and took care of major issues without us asking! For example, on our wedding day, there were some issues with broken doors at our venue. Without hesitation, Christine tackled the issue for us so that we could continue our beautiful wedding day without having to worry. We appreciate her help and our wedding day would truly not be what it was without her! Furthermore, Christine is great with people. She was able to handle our HUGE wedding party for wedding rehearsals, helped our friend get ordained as our minister, and coordinated all our vendors with ease. Christine made sure we were always taken care of and were not stressed by anything on our wedding day. She went way above and beyond what she needed to do. We have already recommended her highly to all our friends and family and hope you will do the same. Even our entire wedding party and our guests who had the pleasure of meeting Christine spoke highly of her and her organization! Do yourself a favor and reach out. We promise you will not regret it. She will definitely execute your event perfectly.

Tosca was great. She helped guide us through the wedding process from soup to nuts. She was helpful in thinking about our decor, our theme, and finding vendors. She helped us find our photographer, photo booth folks, and in the last few months leading up to our big day she really helped to make sure we were on target with our to do's and she kept all of our vendors updated and on the same page.
