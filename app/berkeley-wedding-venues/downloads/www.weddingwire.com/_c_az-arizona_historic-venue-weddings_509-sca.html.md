Kimberley was so amazing to work with. She has helped me plan this wedding for over a year. When my special day came she was so helpful with anything and everything I needed. To making sure everyone was hydrated, making sure things were in order and on time, to just making sure I was ok even with my happy tears! Thank you to the team for helping with setting up and cleaning up!! I highly recommend this venue. It is beautiful and the staff are so great to work with!

Loved that we were able to use the ambiance of the venue to add to the rustic old world feel we wanted our wedding vibe to be. We used family antiques and heirlooms for decor and couldn’t have been more thrilled! The team had everything ready for our arrival and was there every step of the way! Thanks!

Absolutely amazing! They were so easy and flexible to work with and it honestly made wedding planning SO easy! Tyra and the Landmark team took so much weight off our shoulders and we had the best day!! They are budget friendly, have so many options to work with, and I like that they have vendors that work with them regularly that made the catering, photography, florist, etc. so much easier!

Kingan Gardens is one of the best outside garden venues in Tucson. The staff was so wonderful and made my day the best it could have ever been. Sheila is a saint and does what ever is needed to make sure your day is special.

Aside from the Arizona Inn being the perfect setting for a beautiful wedding reception, I can’t say enough about the professionalism of Crystal, the Banquet and Event Manager, as well as the banquet staff. Crystal’s experience and flexibility made it easy for us to plan out all the details, and the Inn’s accommodation toward our outside vendors (florist, baker, etc) enabled us to enjoy a stress-free wedding day. The food itself was outstanding and wedding catering package a tremendous value.

My husband and I could not have been more pleased with this venue. We stressed over and over that we wanted our guests to have an experience. We couldn't find a venue that provided that until we stumbled on the railroad. The service was amazing. The food was delightful (and affordable!). The car was beautiful! Our guests are still talking about it. I freaking love this place.

It was super important for us to get married in downtown Phoenix, and Heritage Square was perfect. We chose the Lath Pavilion, which, despite being only partially shaded, was totally tolerable even at the end of September. They were truly wonderful to work with; Shannon was very responsive, accommodating, friendly, and professional. A huge bonus was that they let us choose our own vendors, which allowed us to personalize our wedding AND save money! The venue was absolutely beautiful on the day of the wedding without a ton of extra decorating; we kept it simple and it still looked great. The venue also allowed for really great photo backdrops within walking distance. Overall, it was absolutely perfect and we are so happy we chose Heritage Square.
