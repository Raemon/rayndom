My wife and I had a wedding there recently and it was so perfect. They are very LGBTQ+ friendly! Their food is well-priced (you do have to get food through them, and price ranges are super varied, with options for any budget) and SO GOOD. We got the pulled pork and chicken alfredo for our main entrees and it was seriously the best of both I have ever had. Our guests were raving for several days about how amazing the food is. Service was incredible as well. Had a couple folks picking up plates and garbage for us. Head cook person made sure to have our food ready at the perfect time and he was so kind. The provide tables, linens, cutlery, and plates. They were always prompt with every interaction and were flexible on scheduling. We also had about 90 guests and there was more than enough room for them. I also liked that the head table could be in a gazebo a tiny bit away from everyone else--gave me time to separate from the guests and take a breather for a few minutes. They are flexible on placements though, so you don't have to sit there if you don't want to. They also require you to go through Ken's Kegs for alcohol. They were wonderful too! So kind and the drinks were spectacular. My wife doesn't drink so they brought a TON of delicious NA options for her, which I thought was awesome! All in all, fantastic venue, staff, and food. If I could do it over again, I'd want it no other way.

The Bellevue Berry Farm Buena Vista Barn was a top of the line wedding experience. The venue sells itself in terms of appearance but the lovely decorator they have enhances the natural beauty of the barn wonderfully! The venue is affordable and the staff is so nice to work with.

My wife and I attended a wedding here a few weekends ago and was blown away at how cool this venue was. No other place in Omaha has this vibe. I have since recommended this place to my friends and family that are engaged.

When I started looking for venues I knew I wanted it to be a barn, away from the noise and light pollution of the city, as well as a bathroom in the bridal suite. After looking at 10+ barns, Wishing Hills Barn stood out far beyond any of the other options within 50 miles. I was very impressed at how well the staff worked with our other vendors. They always responded to my emails and phone calls promptly. I would also note that they did not have any hidden fees. They were very upfront and I always felt that they were honest about their prices. The co-owners were professional, but also friendly. They listened and always made me feel heard and supported. There are 2 things I would note though. First, the acoustics in the barn are not ideal (especially if you have 200+ guests like we did). This might be something your DJ or band can address, but should be taken into consideration. Second, minus the first few rows, the venue prefers to use benches instead of chairs outside for your guests. If you have an older crowd this may not be comfortable or convenient for them. All-in-all, I have no regrets. My wedding was everything I hoped for and more. I truly believe this venue was a big part of that.

We absolutely loved everything about Heartland Country Barn. The owners are so friendly, responsive, and helpful, and the venue is absolutely gorgeous. It is a HUGE selling point that you can bring your own alcohol, use whatever caterer you want, etc. The freedom this venue gives you is SO awesome!!! They also have a huge warehouse of available items to rent decor from them for cheap & give you the option leave your no-longer-wanted decor for them to add to their collection! Everything went perfect with this vendor and I would absolutely recommend them to anyone!

I highly recommend using Fonner Park for your reception needs. They were very professional, accommodating, and helpful. The area was very spacious and clean, allowing for us to have enough room for all of our friends and family. Everything was taken care of in a timely manner, questions answered, along with things being taken care of for us, and was all at a reasonable price. We had the best time with Fonner Park and will recommend them to anyone!
