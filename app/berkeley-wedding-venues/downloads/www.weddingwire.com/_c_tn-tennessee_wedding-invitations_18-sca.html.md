Wow! Jenny and Rick truly know how to work under pressure as we couldn't get our final seating chart finalized until crunch time. The result: absolutely gorgeousness of an oversized seating chart mirror that even children were marveling at their names spelled out the most beautifully they have ever seen. The artistry and design is by far the most superior of any calligrapher out there.

Donnette and Steve were great to work with. They were quick, responsive, and super easy to work with. I found a wedding table sign online that after a little research I found out was done by Designs in Paper so I reached out to see if they could help me recreate the design with the text I wanted. Not only did they make the signs exactly like what I asked for but they made them even better than I could have imagined. It was so easy!! We worked exclusively through email and I received the table signs in less than a week! To say we are obsessed with the signs would be an understatement. We are thrilled to show these off at our wedding. I could not be happier.

Couldn't have been any happier with my invitations! The staff are very helpful & attentive to detail. I ordered very classic, heavy weighted invitations for a fraction of what I had budgeted for them. RSVP Stationers was extremely affordable & also very fast! The invitations came on the time schedule I'd been told. I had no problems whatsoever & received many compliments! I will continue to use them for all my stationary needs going forward! You will not regret doing business with them!!!

I had worked with the lovely ladies at Buchanan Ink through my work at Vanderbilt and just knew I had to use them for our wedding invitations! I knew I wanted something fairly casual and unique and they helped me find the most perfect gold thermography invitation for our outdoor affair (and on a budget I might add!). I would recommend Buchanan Ink to any bride! Everyone who received the invite just raved about it!

Sue and her team from the paper place are great to work with. I enjoyed the entire process of picking out and ordering our invitations so much. Sue was always there to help and is very patient. We also ordered our cocktail napkins through Sue which we loved as well!

Loved my invitations! They looked amazing, and when we forgot to order inner envelopes, they were amazing and gave us extras! They were fast and affordable, and everything looked perfect. Thanks!

The selection and prices at C&D printing were amazing. I looked over so many magazines and struggled with finding a simple, yet cheap design that really matched what I wanted. C&D had the perfect design for my invitations, bookmarks, and napkins and it was a lot cheaper than the other places that I had checked with. I received my items within a week and was so pleased with the quality and that the items turned out exactly as I had expected and hoped for.

I couldn't say enough great things about Troy and the team at The Dotted Line! I came to them after I had a bit of a stressful time designing invitations through another company, and when they took over, all the stress turned to fun! Sitting at Troy's desk is the most inspiring place! She always does great work and it was so exciting to see how creative all the pieces they create are! You can always reach them and always get what you love!
