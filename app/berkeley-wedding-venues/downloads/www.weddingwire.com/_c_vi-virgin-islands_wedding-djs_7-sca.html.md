Liston was an amazing DJ! He had all of our wedding guests dancing the entire night! Prior to the wedding, I was able to create a list of music that we wanted played and songs that we did not want played. Liston knew exactly how to feel out the crowd and had some great remixes. I would definitely hire him again for an event in a heartbeat.

Patrick was amazing! He has a great personality and was the perfect MC and DJ for my wife and I's unforgettable day! He knew how to get the crowd moving and once the dancing started nobody sat down until the event ended and he had to kick everyone out! Everybody loved him too. Thank you again Patrick we would've never wanted to use another DJ for our wedding! Joseph and Jackie
