Based in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, My Daughters' Collection is a wedding and special event rental company offering unique and eye-catching tableware for your big day. The business serves all of South Central Pennsylvania and specializes in providing mismatched antique china and glassware, as well as a collection of more modern choices. No matter how you decide to set the table at your celebration, My Daughters' Collection has them, and you, covered. 

**Experience**

My Daughters' Collection was created by husband-and-wife duo Scott and Lindsay Bert, born out of love for their children and, most notably, for their daughters' wedding dreams. This care and joy flow through the married pair and their services. The couple was inspired when their son married in 2022, and the table was adorned with vintage mismatched dishes, glasses, and beautiful vases to add an elegant touch to proceedings. In 2023, at their daughter's marriage on a restored farm in Pennsylvania, Scott and Lindsay looked at a collection started by their daughter-in-law, to which they continued to add pieces from thrift shops, auctions, and online scouring. Their daughter's wedding was a dream come true as she played on her garden wedding theme with colorful and vibrant antique tableware provided by the family. 

**Services Offered**

The antique collectors and rental specialists have a selection of plates, glasses, Champagne flutes, vases, candle holders, flatware, linens, and silverware for your special occasion. Various colors and designs are available, meaning your theme and aesthetic can be respected as you add a touch of antique style and class. If you desire, more miscellaneous items can be added. You can find the entire range of products on the My Daughters' Collection website. The creative and professional team handles the delivery and setup, freeing you to concentrate on what matters most.

Beautiful Dishware and Excellent Service. 

I recently had the pleasure of working with My Daughters Collection for our wedding, and I couldn’t have been more impressed! From start to finish, the entire experience was flawless. The selection of dishware was beautiful, high-quality, and exactly what we envisioned for our wedding. The eclectic vintage plates and colorful goblets really made our reception more personalized and unique.   
  
The customer service was outstanding—attentive, responsive, and incredibly helpful in ensuring all of our needs were met. They were flexible with delivery and pick up times and worked seamlessly with our bartenders and caterer to ensure everything was set up exactly as we had planned.  
  
The dishware added an elegant touch to our reception, and we received countless compliments on how stunning it all looked. I truly believe it helped elevate the entire atmosphere of our celebration. If you're planning a wedding and need beautiful dishware, I highly recommend My Daughters Collection.
