We had the most wonderful experience getting married at The Birchwood in downtown St. Petersburg. From the very beginning, Marlice and Claire were incredible to work with. They are organized, responsive, and truly on top of every detail every step of the way. Throughout the weekend, guests repeatedly came up to us to rave about how beautiful St. Pete is for a wedding, especially in December, and how absolutely outstanding the food was. The ballroom itself is simply stunning and the entire team does an amazing job of making you feel completely at home. We cannot recommend The Birchwood or its people more highly. It was truly the perfect place to celebrate our wedding with the people we love!

I cannot recommend the Beach House Waterfront Restaurant and the team from Beachside Hospitality enough. If there was a term for a "turnkey" wedding, this would be it. From Carley working with me to figure out if I needed the full deck to Shawn who kept everything rolling smoothly day of to their recommended vendors of Sandhill Photography, Say I Do on the Suncoast, and DJKenwa, everything was just perfect. I'm pretty sure every one of my guests told me how beautiful everything was. Food was great, service was attentive. I absolutely had my dream wedding day. If you're considering this venue, book it! You won't regret it.

If you are considering getting married at Bellwether, read this story!! After staying in the beautifully renovated hotel several times before, my husband and I decided to get married here on 10/12/24. It also has special meaning for me, as I celebrated my First Communion in the Bird's Nest when it was still a Howard Johnson. From the moment we met Amalfi Lopez, Wedding Coordinator extraordinaire, we knew we had found the perfect place for our big day! Throughout the planning process, Amalfi was a constant source of support, always guiding me with patience and care. Then, just two weeks before the wedding, Hurricane Helene hit Florida. As the storm passed, Amalfi kept me updated on the status of Bellwether, but when she finally gained access to the property, she broke the news that it couldn’t be repaired in time for our wedding. I was devastated, but Amalfi stayed on the phone with me, comforting me (she handled my ugly sobbing like a pro) and assuring me that we’d figure something out. At that point, I honestly thought we wouldn’t be able to get married after all the planning. But two hours later, Amalfi called again with good news. The Bellwether team had decided to help us find a new venue and honor our original contract—even though the new venues were significantly more expensive. We toured the new options, and Amalfi was with us every step of the way. She helped me shift my mindset, hugged me when I felt overwhelmed, and supported me through every decision. In the end, we decided to move the wedding to Hotel Flor in Downtown Tampa, which meant completely re-planning the event in just two weeks. Our guests’ reservations were transferred, we chose new menus without a tasting, and all the wedding decor we had picked out for Bellwether was ruined. But Amalfi and Jenny at Hotel Flor went above and beyond to secure alternatives and make it all work. Then, just a week before the wedding, Hurricane Milton started threatening Florida. By the Wednesday before our wedding, it hit, causing widespread power outages in Downtown Tampa and surrounding areas. But somehow, Hotel Flor was one of the few places with power, so we made the decision to move forward with the wedding. Even though many of our guests were dealing with power outages and uncertainty, we went for it. On Friday, Amalfi showed up for the rehearsal after days without power, determined to make our wedding happen. And on Saturday, she became my day-of coordinator, ensuring everything ran smoothly behind the scenes. I can honestly say that without Amalfi’s help, our wedding would not have been as beautiful or memorable as it was. I’ll be forever grateful to Amalfi and the Bellwether team for making our wedding happen, despite two massive hurricanes. It’s a day we’ll never forget! We plan to come stay with you for our 1st Anniversary and would love to meet some of the people who made this possible. Amalfi, prepare for tears and hugs at our reunion!

We recently had our wedding at The Bilmar Beach Resort in Treasure Island (October 2025), and our experience was exceptional from start to finish. First and foremost, I want to recognize Danielle Jardieu, who was the absolute MVP of our planning process. She was consistently responsive, organized, and incredibly detail-oriented. No matter the question or concern, she was always one phone call away and made us feel supported the entire way through. Her professionalism and warmth set the tone for our entire experience. The property had suffered significant damage during the October 2024 hurricane, but the Bilmar team worked tirelessly to restore and improve the resort. By the time our wedding arrived, the venue looked better than ever! It was beautifully updated, spotless, and ready to host not just our wedding, but many others. The hotel provided accommodations for us, our bridal party, and many friends and family members traveling from out of town. Everyone raved about their rooms, the cleanliness, the views, and the attentive service. Whatever we needed during our stay, the staff delivered quickly and graciously. On the day of the wedding, the entire staff made me feel like a queen. Everything flowed smoothly and seamlessly. Any request I had, big or small, was handled immediately and with care. The ceremony, reception, and overall atmosphere were everything I dreamed of and more. Choosing The Bilmar as our wedding venue was one of the best decisions we made. Their dedication, hospitality, and genuine care for their guests and couples truly set them apart. I wholeheartedly recommend this venue to any couple looking for a beautiful, reliable, and unforgettable wedding experience.

As I've grown up going to AMI every summer, it's been my dream to have my wedding at The Sandbar. My dream finally came true and it did not disappoint. The Sandbar team was incredible - they truly understood my vision, were attentive to my requests/questions, and overall really cared about my experience. The wedding was everything I dreamed of and more - the food, incredible, the decorations, also incredible, and the team, the absolute best. Haley was my day-of coordinator and she was by my side every step of the way, making the day seamless and fun. I can't recommend this team and place enough. Thank you so so much for the perfect day!

My husband and I were married on November 22, 2025 aboard the Yacht StarShip II, and from start to finish, our experience with Yacht StarShip was wonderful. We worked with Wendy during the planning process who was incredibly kind, accommodating, and patient. She took the time to meet with us and speak over the phone on multiple occasions, answered all of our questions, toured us through the ships, and walked us through the contract details thoroughly. We always felt supported and informed. Leading up to the wedding, our coordinator Eric was amazing. He was organized, detail-oriented, and incredibly thoughtful with his questions, which gave us so much confidence that we were in great hands. Our wedding day was even smoother and more beautiful than I could have imagined. Eric and the rest of the staff truly catered to us and guided us through every part of the day—we didn’t have to lift a finger. Months later, our guests still talk about the delicious food, the beauty of the venue, and how well-planned the entire day felt. The captain and crew were friendly, professional, and attentive throughout the event. A special shout-out to our captain, who graciously gave my grandfather his hat to wear. My grandfather has skin cancer on his head and had forgotten his own hat, and the captain didn’t hesitate to help. My grandfather was absolutely over the moon by this thoughtful gesture. We can’t say enough great things and would highly recommend Yacht StarShip to any couple looking for an affordable, beautiful, and seamless wedding experience.

There aren’t enough words to describe how grateful we are for Marsha and the tireless work she did to make our wedding truly remarkable. My fiancé and I had a very heartbreaking experience while planning our wedding, where we had to postpone due to Hurricane Milton, and then postpone a second time due to the untimely passing of my Father. Just two days after the hurricane and after postponing our formal event, we wanted to hold an intimate service at the Chapel because my father who was very ill at the time had traveled to be there for our wedding day. Marsha came to the chapel, set up a lovely display outside, and was supportive to us as we held our service. She never charged a penny more for the extra time and effort, and she was the most compassionate and professional vendor we could have ever asked for. We were finally able to hold our formal ceremony last weekend, and Marsha left no detail amiss, running our rehearsal and making the Chapel and grounds just breathtaking. Our guests were blown away by the intimacy, beauty, and pride that clearly exists at Andrew’s Memorial Chapel. What Marsha and the historical society did for us and our families is unforgettable. The scenery and atmosphere are incredible, and we will live a lifetime of joyous memories of this place. Even the brick we were able to lay on their pathway with our wedding date to give us a place to return to was such a perfect touch. Thank you, Marsha, for everything. ❤️
