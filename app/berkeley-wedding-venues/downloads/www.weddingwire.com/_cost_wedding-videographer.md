Average Videography cost $1,799 Lower range $500 or less Upper range $3,900 or more Most couples spend between $1,000 - $2,500

Costs displayed in graph are based on spend from thousands of couples who recently reported pricing for this service within their WeddingWire review. Pricing varies based on factors including, but not limited to, vendor’s experience, level of expertise, event guest count, date, and geographic region.

## How much does a wedding videographer cost?

Your [wedding videographer](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/the-5-reasons-you-must-hire-a-videographer-for-your-wedding) is an important part of your vendor team. He or she will create a priceless memory of your day that you’ll cherish for years to come—one that includes visuals, sound, and motion. The cost of a wedding videographer does vary widely depending on your pro’s experience and level of expertise, in addition to your wedding’s location. The average cost of a wedding videographer in the U.S. is around $1,799 with most couples spending between $1,000 to $2,500.

## What impacts a wedding videographer's prices?

There are a variety of factors that can impact wedding videography prices, some may be obvious and others less so.

  * Time: The amount of time that your videographer is present at your wedding will greatly impact the cost—most wedding videography packages include the amount of time that your video pro will spend at your wedding. The more time he or she is filming, the more you’re likely to pay. And if you would like your videographer to cover other events, like your rehearsal dinner, that will add more to the cost of your wedding videographer.
  * Staffing: Your videographer may bring a second shooter and/or an assistant to your wedding. The more staff members present, the higher your wedding videographer’s price is likely to be. 
  * Final Product: What will you receive from your videographer? Most videographers will provide you with edited wedding videos (a highlight reel and an edited wedding film), and some will also provide your raw footage. If you’d like short edited clips for social media or other types of edited clips, that will likely add to your wedding videographer cost.
  * Extras: Some videographers (about 43 percent) offer [drone footage](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/drones-the-wedding-video-trend-you-have-to-see-to-believe), Super 8 film, extra DVDs or USB drives, or other extras and effects at additional cost.
  * Travel: If your wedding videographer will be traveling a long distance to be present at your wedding, you’ll likely have to pay for his or her gas mileage, airfare, hotel or other travel charges. 



## What's included in the cost of a wedding videographer?

You may think that you’re just paying for your final wedding videos, but actually there’s a lot more to wedding videography prices than just the actual videos. Here are the [main things that are typically included in a wedding videographer’s cost](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/why-a-wedding-videographer-costs-that-much).

  * Videography Service: You are paying for your videographer’s time and presence at your event, usually for a previously agreed-upon number of hours. Any extras, like drone footage, or travel expenses can add to this cost as well, as can additional team members.
  * Post-Production: The editing process is actually the most time-consuming part of creating your wedding video. Sometimes the editing will be done by the same person who filmed your wedding, other times a separate editor will work on your wedding film. Your videographer may also allow you to make a round of edits to your wedding video, but additional edits may cost more.
  * Final Product: Your wedding videos will likely be provided to you via DVD, Blu-ray, or USB drive. A highlight reel may also be made available via YouTube or Vimeo for easy sharing. If you require additional copies of your wedding DVD, Blu-ray disc, or USB, you will likely incur additional charges. Some videographers add personalized packaging to your final product, which can be a nice touch. 
  * Equipment: Your videographer should have the most up-to-date equipment that is in working order—from high-definition cameras to lighting equipment and more. 



## Do wedding videographer packages include anything in addition to wedding videos?

Most basic wedding videography packages include a full-length feature wedding video and a highlight reel, sometimes along with the raw footage from your wedding day. However, your wedding videographer can create other videos including save-the-date videos, reception introduction videos, and a photo slideshow or montage for your rehearsal dinner. Of course, these “extra” videos will add to the cost of a wedding videographer, but they can make a great (and creative!) addition to your wedding. Your wedding videographer may also be able to cut video snippets ideal for sharing on social media. 

## When should I hire a wedding videographer?

We recommend [hiring your wedding videographer](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-find-the-perfect-wedding-videographer) at least eight months before your wedding date, as these pros tend to book up quickly. Start the research process by [reading online reviews of vendors](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-videographers) in your area, and viewing their work. Once you’ve narrowed down the list of videographers you’re interested in, reach out and set up meetings with a few. 

## What questions should I ask a wedding videographer before hiring?

It’s important to find a videographer whose work you love and who is within budget, as well as a professional whom you feel comfortable with. You’re going to be spending a lot of time with your videographer, so he or she should have a personality you love! Here are a few [questions that are important to ask a wedding videographer](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-questions-to-ask-a-videographer) before hiring:

  * How would you describe your videography style?
  * Can I [choose music](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-songs-from-wedding-videos-were-obsessing-over) for my wedding films?
  * Have you worked with my photographer before?
  * How many weddings have you filmed? How many weddings will you film this year?
  * When will I receive my finished, edited wedding video?
  * Have you shot at my venue before?
  * Can you describe your editing process? Do I get any input into the final product?
  * Can you share your wedding packages list and wedding video cost?
  * Can I see a finished wedding video that you created for another couple?
  * Do you typically bring a second shooter or assistant to weddings?



## Do I have to tip my wedding videographer?

[Wedding vendor tips](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-tipping-guide) are an important cost to factor into your wedding day budget. We recommend tipping your wedding videographer between $100 to $200 as a thank-you for exceptional service. We also recommend [writing your wedding videographer an online review](https://www.weddingwire.com/shared/rate?formEntryPoint=40) as an additional thank-you. 

## How can I save money on my wedding videographer?

We highly recommend hiring an experienced wedding videographer for your wedding (as opposed to a friend or family member)—and yes, that does cost money. However, there are ways to save some cash without sacrificing having an awesome wedding video:

  * Cut the time: As mentioned, the more time your wedding videographer is filming at your wedding, the more you’ll pay. To save money, you can have your videographer skip the pre-wedding getting ready process, or leave halfway through your reception. A four-hour videography package will certainly cost less than a 12-hour one. Some videographers can shoot your ceremony only if you prefer. You can adjust your [wedding timeline](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-timeline) to make sure your videographer doesn’t miss the important moments like special dances or toasts.
  * Don’t ask for extras: Extras like drone footage or Super 8 film will add to your wedding videographer’s prices. Keep your wedding video simple, with minimal effects to keep costs down—and don’t go overboard making revisions to the final product. 
  * Ask for raw footage: The editing process tends to be the most time-consuming—and therefore, the costliest. Your videographer may be willing to film your wedding and simply give you the raw footage rather than editing it into a final wedding film or highlights reel. You may choose to have this footage edited later on, or not.
