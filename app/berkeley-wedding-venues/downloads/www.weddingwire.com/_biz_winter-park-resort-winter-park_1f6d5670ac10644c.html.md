When I look back at our weekend, we had a lot of unexpected things thrown at us...construction, weather, housing issues. All of these things were outside of Ellen and Kaia’s control, but they did an amazing job being with us the whole time and helping us make it the wedding we wanted. For example, the weather at ceremony time was not looking good and we were talking about moving it inside, which broke my heart. Then we got word that there was a small window of good weather. They both could see how much we wanted to have the ceremony outside. They had all 130 of our guests outside in 5 minutes and we had a beautiful outdoor ceremony. That was then followed up by a gorgeous indoor reception. All our guests raved at the food, views, and service.

Couldn't have asked for a better place to have our wedding! Emily and the team at Winter Park exceeded our expectations in every way. The food was excellent and the setting was beautiful. When a surprise snow occurred as the wedding was supposed to begin, Emily and her team did everything they could to ensure it was still a beautiful and memorable event, and it the snow actually made the outdoor ceremony all the more fun and memorable. Can't recommend Winter Park enough for the perfect wedding!

From day one I decided to do the majority of the planning myself, and to hire a day of coordinator to execute on our wedding day. Winter Park Resort seemed to be a dream come true, then, when we heard that the wonderful Emily Jackson was not only the sales manager for events, but also takes over day of coordination on the big day. Emily's wealth of experience, helpful advice throughout and calm, "say yes" approach to all questions/concerns/thoughts/new decorating ideas, put me so at ease from day one and I couldn't be more grateful to her. During our venue search she was the only person that replied to our inquiry and follow up questions quickly, had great energy during our site tour, and seemed genuinely pleased to meet us and to want to help our vision come to life. Not only that, but she helped us plan our rehearsal dinner, welcome party, AND day after breakfast. As for the venue itself, the Lodge at Sunspot is above and beyond what we could have imagined. We wanted to be on-mountain, at an "all in one" venue: nothing to build from the ground up, hotels within walking distance to everything, and amenities galore. Plus, the Resort is a very "Colorado" experience and perfectly showcased our home state to our family and friends - riding the chairlift with my father, in my wedding dress, was a highlight I won't soon forget.

Working with Emily Jackson and her amazing crew to organize & book a wedding at Winter Park was a breeze. Her enthusiasm & energy made planning from a distance effortless. The attention to detail & endless questions were taken care of in a very timely manner. Everything from booking the accomodations to the wedding ceremony went very smoothly. Emily's recommendations for local vendors were spot on. Our guests are still talking about the amazing time they had exploring Winter Park, riding the lifts to the wedding, the great food & hospitality all topped off by a breathtaking sunset. All and all a perfect wedding - thanks!

Laura and I cannot say enough about how happy we were with our experience with Emily Jackson and her team at the Winter Park Resort. From the moment we met Emily, we knew the planning process would be just as enjoyable as the wedding itself. In the months leading up to the wedding, Emily was always available to answer our questions and to help guide us with the wedding details. From vendor selection to travel recommendations, she would always provide a helping hand to ensure we and our guests would have a great experience.  
  
In the days and weeks leading up to the wedding, Emily was on top of all of our details and anticipated questions and concerns before we even asked. When the day of the wedding came, we were as relaxed and ready to have a great time as we could have possibly been. Both Emily and her staff made the day of the wedding truly special and we would recommend anyone looking to get married in the mountains to consider Winter Park Resort.  
  
Again, we had an absolutely perfect experience and have only heard glowing reviews from everyone who was able to attend our wedding.

We had the most amazing wedding at winter park! Emily and all of the staff were so accommodating and helpful! They worked with our schedules for rehearsal dinner and wedding. They helped place all our decorations. The bridal suite was such a great place to get ready with all my girls. The recommendations for vendors were great and most had discounted travel fees! Emily was also great at keeping us on track with our planning and meeting whenever we asked. Our wedding at winter park was perfect!
