Watching your son grow up and get married is an incredibly special experience for any parent. Acknowledge the role your mom played in getting you to this moment by picking out a thoughtful mother of the groom gift she can use to celebrate or hold onto as a memento. We're sharing all the best gift ideas for mothers of the groom, whether you're shopping for your own mom or you want to thank your future MIL for [helping out with the wedding](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-include-your-mother-in-law-in-wedding-planning). We've thought of something for every kind of mother, from keepsake jewelry that'll always remind her of your special day to pampering products that'll help her wind down afterward. 

## Who buys the mother of the groom a gift?

It's considered proper etiquette to buy [gifts for both sets of parents](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-gift-ideas-for-parents) at a wedding, no matter [who is picking up the bill](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/who-pays-for-what-in-a-wedding). While it's totally fine to buy a shared present for both the mother and father of the groom, getting separate gifts for both of your parents (or parents-in-law) is a little more personal. But who should be responsible for buying and giving the mother of the groom a gift? Ultimately, that's up to you and your partner to decide.

Some soonlyweds choose to give the mother of the groom a gift as a couple, while others prefer to take care of their own parents' presents. It's also acceptable for the groom's S.O. to buy the mother of the groom a gift, especially if she really went the extra mile in fulfilling her [wedding duties](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/father-and-mother-of-the-groom-duties). Last but not least, the mother of the groom may also receive gifts from close friends to help her celebrate the special occasion.
