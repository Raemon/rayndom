I booked Mark as a live painter for my wedding. Booking was super easy and contract was clear. Mark and Anna are extremely reliable and kind people. This was the one vendor I did not have to worry about showing up on our big day. Our painting came out beautiful and added such a unique twist to our wedding day. After the wedding, Mark follows up with you to discuss any features you would like to add to your painting and is very accommodating. He even added in our dog into the painting, who was at the wedding, but not in the shot that we chose for him to paint. To top it off, Mark and Anna were able to drop off our painting to our home while they were passing by on a trip with their children. Great experience- look no further!

My fiance and I were looking to give our groomsmen and bridesmaides quality hand crafted gifts. After doing some research we were able to find Ahlers Designs. Located in Pawtucket, Rhode Island this company is simply amazing. We purchased a handful of business card cases for our groomsmen and jewelry cases for the bridesmaids, all of which were shipped on time and look absolutely beautiful. We know these gifts will not only impress everyone who sees them, but also mirror our committment to each other by lasting a life time.

OUTSTANDING! Madeleine, owner of Beautiful Things was recommended by Diane @ The Baggins End Guest House (the reception location) to "help out" with any little things we may need in the design and coordinating of our daughter's wedding. Initially, I thought it would be an unneccesary expense but, after meeting w/Madeleine, it quickly became apparent that retaining her services would be one of the BEST investments we would be making to ensure a beautiful and worry-free celebration. Madeleine addressed all the invitations in her own special style which was lovely and unique - an alternative to calligraphy. My daughter and I both knew that we did not want traditional floral centerpieces for this reception and when Madeleine heard this, she designed beautiful arrangements in antiqued metal urns bursting with grapes, artichokes, limes and sunflowers to echo the theme of abundance and great food! From the table and reception design to the day-of coordination and so much more, Madeleine and her staff helped to pull it all together - at a very reasonable cost.

The owner and mastermind of Stella Marie made custom wedding favors for my special day, which consisted of gorgeous replicas of my beloved dogs. The packaging and presentation was lovely but the bonus was the soaps are high quality with no harsh ingredients. They leave your skin feeling soft and smooth. The best part though is Kim's creativity and can do attitude. Kim can make anything out of soap. If you want unique, thoughtful and quality wedding favors, look no further.

Amy’s Apples was such a joy to work with! We had our taste testing first, and were able to choose some flavors out of a long list that they offer. We had only wanted something simple, and that is exactly what they gave us! We chose a 3-tier funfetti cake, and had a sheet cake of strawberry shortcake as well to feed our 200 guests. Pricing was very reasonable, response time was super quick, and the entire process was quick and easy! You won’t be disappointed with this company (:

Gracie’s was the perfect venue for our 70 person wedding. I wanted an elegant dinner party feel and it did not disappoint. Not to mention the food was amazing!! All of our guests raved about the food and said it was the best they’ve had at a wedding by far. They, and we, can’t wait to go back for dinner another time. After dinner, the team at Gracie’s seamlessly transformed the room into a dance floor. They took care of clean up as well so we just had to pick up our decorations the next day! Maria was amazing and so helpful throughout the whole process. While most people thought I was crazy for planning a wedding in 4 months, she assured me it was more than enough time! She is well connected in the industry and was able to offer vendor suggestions. She answered all my crazy questions and calmed all my nerves. Maria took care of everything day of I didn’t have to worry about a thing! Could not have been happier with my wedding at Gracie’s!

Marie was so nice and helpful. I used Chocolate Delicacy for my delicious wedding favors. They were hand dipped oreos in handmade milk chocolate. Marie packaged them nicely and put a sticker on them and purple ribbon and purple sprinkles to go with our theme. They were a big hit and everyone loved them. We were glad we ordered extras to have some ourselves. These favors were within my budget and I think very well priced. We did shop at a nearby competitor of Marie's and were treated very rudely and the price was much more. I highly recommend Chocolate Delicacy and will use them again!
