Christa at Simply Torn was fantastic to work with. From design to printing she was patient and worked with us until we had something we loved and they came out great. It’s not the cheapest option but you get what you pay for. She was so accommodating to our changes and worked with our schedules to get us what we needed. We would highly recommend her for anyone looking for custom stationary for their wedding.

Radiant Reflections was a joy to work with during my daughter's wedding preparations. The fine detail of Carol's work is amazing. She can make even a simple item become a masterpiece with her script. We had decided to use a birdhouse to collect cards at the reception and after we decorated it with paint and flowers - it still wasnt the look we wanted. Just a couple days before the wedding, we mentioned our dilemma to Carol, she added her script to the birdhouse and it was exactly what we had envisioned. She is excellent at turning our thoughts into reality. I would highly recommend Radiant Reflections for personal, timely work at a great value.

My husband ordered his tuxes from Savvi and we got a pretty good discount on our invitations. Savvi was very helpful during the ordering process and we received the invitations quickly too. We got a lot of complements of the uniqueness of our invitations!

Working with Laurel to create our save the dates, custom logo, and wedding invitations was one of my single favorite activities in planning my wedding. We spoke about the vision, likes and dislikes, and then Laurel created a mood board to see what spoke to me. From there, she created a logo and a save the date that make the starting statement to my wedding. My wedding invitation was not an un-involved process. She had to create our invite with multiple inserts and somehow managed to blend my more artsy/moody style with my husband's modern one. Laurel is sweet, attentive and creative. I have recommended her to multiple people since our wedding and would love to work with her again for other projects in the future. 5 Stars and a Raving Review from this gal!

Jennie was so easy to work with! I had no idea what I was looking for, only what I didn't want. She was very patient and designed everything for us with a classic look that was unique to us. It was great to have a cohesive look throughout everything. Loved supporting this woman owned small business!

I cannot recommend working with Laura at Invited By Lamaworks enough. I worked with her for my wedding invites, day of stationary needs, and thank you cards for my wedding and was completely blown away by the quality of everything that we received. We had multiple compliments on our stationary from guests as well. She was such a pleasure to work with, and I will use her for all stationary needs in the future! Highly highly recommend.
