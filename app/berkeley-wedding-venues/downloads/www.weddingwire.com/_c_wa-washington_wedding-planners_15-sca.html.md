This Will Be wedding planning was fantastic! Payton made the planning process simple and stress free. She was there every step to help us make our dream wedding come true. She was very knowledgeable in helping us find creative ways to stay within our tight budget. Not having to worry about a single thing the day of our wedding was the biggest blessing. As a particular bride, she made sure everything was executed the way I wanted so we could spend the time together and with our loved ones. Highly recommend This Will Be for your wedding planning!

Amber and her parents were an incredible help throughout our wedding process. From the very beginning, they were organized, attentive, and truly cared about making sure everything went smoothly. On the day of the wedding, Amber handled every detail with such professionalism, with her parents providing amazing support behind the scenes, which allowed us to fully enjoy our special day without any stress!

Angela was an amazing wedding planner for my dreamy winter wedding. We worked together for over 13 months and she helped me with everything from choosing the venue to choosing my cake cutting set. We had a 110 person winter wedding above Leavenworth. The day of the wedding everything went flawlessly and I had my dream wedding and didn't have to stress about a thing. She communicates clearly and often and is very calm under pressure. Her recommendations for vendors were all amazing and she was always mindful of my budget. I can't recommend her enough and I know my day wouldn't have been so amazing without her there.

We hired Jamie as our day-of coordinator, and we are so glad we did! Each consultation we had with Jamie leading up to the day was extremely productive. This was the first time we had planned an event of this size on our own. We went though every little detail, and she even bought up points we didn't think of. Fast forward to a few weeks before the wedding where various last minute changes were being made due to the weather, but Jamie always have plan "B" in her back pocket.When the day finally came, everything ran smoothly and the MOB could relax and enjoy the celebration. All I had to worry about was having the time of my life. Thank You so much JAMIE- you made our wedding the best day ever!

Krista was great to work! She was always attentive, friendly and professional. She listened to our vision and really helped make it a reality. Along each step of the process she was helpful and on the day of the event really helped make things go smoothly. We would recommend Krista to any couple looking for a wedding planner!

Florals "Your florals were Vogue Bride editorial-worthy." "Your florist deserves an award." "I walked into the tent and my jaw dropped." These are just a few of the things my guests said to me on our wedding day, and they weren’t exaggerating. Candice created the most breathtaking floral arrangements I’ve ever seen. I still haven’t stopped talking about them. I’ve always struggled to articulate exactly what I like and don’t like, but Candice asked all the right questions and truly understood me. Her intuition, creativity, and eye for design are unmatched. I felt so confident in her vision, and she exceeded even my highest expectations. I’m endlessly grateful for her talent and heart. Planning "Candice is the most organized planner I’ve ever worked with." – My hairstylist Like many brides, I was most anxious about the final stretch of planning. Everyone warned me that the last few weeks would be the most stressful. But that simply wasn’t my experience. In fact, I don’t think I lifted a finger in those final weeks because Candice had already prepared us so well and handled everything that came up. She and Christopher were calm, professional, and incredibly on top of every detail. Their presence allowed me to truly relax and enjoy the process and for that, I’ll forever be thankful. The People On top of their incredible talent, Candice and Christopher are just wonderful humans. They are warm, easy to communicate with, and genuinely fun to be around. I know how important it is to vibe with your planner, you're trusting them with such a personal and emotional day, and these two made it feel effortless. They brought calm, joy, and humor into every meeting, and I couldn’t imagine doing this with anyone else.

Katie and her team were absolutely incredible! My partner and I were planning a wedding in Snohomish while living in Australia and decided that we needed a day-of coordinator a little over a month in advance. Thankfully Katie and her team were available for our wedding and were able to provide seamless service leading up to our big day from check lists to coordinating with vendors and making sure that all the details were exactly as we envisioned. Katie was attentive and responsive, made sure that everything ran according to the timeline and was professional in every aspect of planning and execution. Katie’s attention to detail, calm and easy-going demeanor, and ability to bring a vision to life are invaluable. Her familiarity with the venue and knowledge of local vendors gave us so much confidence in choosing Town and Country Weddings, and our only wish is that we were in touch with her earlier! Thanks to Katie and her team, my partner and I were able to be fully present for the best day of our lives. For anyone considering wedding planning and coordination services thoughtfully crafted to embody your love story, Town and Country Weddings is the BEST investment you can make in your big day! Thank you, Katie!

We only had 4 months to plan my daughters wedding. This was an extremely short time for someone who wants things “just right” for her only daughter Rachel stepped in at the suggestion of a friend who used her a couple of years a go. A great decision for my daughter to help with many of the logistics and vendor requests Rachel provided exactly what was needed for support patience knowledge and timelines She was really the difference maker for my daughter to plan the wedding of her dreams in such a short time Thank you Rachel Emily’s mom

It's been a month since we got married, and my husband and I are still just in awe of the most perfect weekend of our lives. We came to Misty at Luxe Productions with a venue and a vision and she took that vision and turned it into an unforgettable weekend---and with only a four month lead time! We're so grateful for the thoughtful and kind communication throughout the whole process. I can't overstate how wonderful it was to have her expert advise and guidance. I had a lot of fun in the planning process and a huge part of that was kicking around ideas with Misty. You can tell that she genuinely cares and that means so much when it's such a big moment for us. My husband and I got married on a beautiful day, during the first weekend of October at Wind Mountain Ranch. We rented out the whole venue for a full weekend of events. On Friday we hosted our guests in the main building for a night of wine tasting from our favorite wineries and paired it with an Indian Buffet from local restaurant Kirpas Indian Cuisine. We also had Alex from Soothe Folk customizing vintage handkerchiefs for our guests. Saturday morning we hosted yoga + soundbath, followed by a beautiful French-inspired picnic on the lawn. Misty and team really outdid themselves with the setup. It was so, so good! Kids and adults alike flew kites and threw frisbees and soaked in the scenery. We really wanted to take advantage of the whole venue, so we had welcome cocktails by the pond, and followed with the ceremony on the main lawn. We couldn't pick a favorite view, so chose to have all of them and had the ceremony in the round. Afterwards, we had a seated, family-style dinner catered by Grand Cru in the main building. Misty's vision for table set-up and suggestion for our seating chart was impeccable. Our guests loved it and haven't stopped talking about all the details from the event. The only negative was that it was over too soon. ;) Highly recommend Misty and the team at Luxe Productions. They are passionate, kind, resourceful and will bring your dream wedding to life.

Alassandra was our wedding coordinator, and we could not have pulled off the reception without her! She made things go so smoothly, and I was able to full enjoy the day without worrying about any hiccups. The communication and attention to detail was great, and I'm so happy we were able to work together!
