I had recently been to another friend’s wedding who used their venue wedding planner for her day-of coordinating, and watched as her careful planning (including pictures and diagrams!) not turn out the way she’d envisioned. Knowing this, I felt even more thankful to have Sam in my corner. Sam was as close to cloning myself as I could get. She took charge with calm confidence, handling every detail behind the scenes so we could fully enjoy the day as we had envisioned it to be. Whether it was managing the timeline, coordinating with the vendors, or making sure everything ran smoothly, Sam was on it before we even had a chance to notice there was a problem when one arose. If you’re looking for someone who will go above and beyond to make sure your day is exactly as you pictured, I can’t recommend Sam enough.

I booked forevermore for the final two months of my wedding and I’m so glad I did! I was constantly asking questions and bothering Brooke at all hours of the day and she was always very quick to respond and happy to help me! I didn’t have to worry about a single thing the day of the wedding and any issues I had she reached out to my vendors and took care of with no issue. She is currently in the process of helping me change my name and has been great with that as well, even calling the social security office for me to answer some of my questions. Although I hope I’ll never need to lol, I would absolutely hire Brooke again for wedding planning and flowers and decor too! Everything was beautiful and I can’t thank her enough!

On the wedding day, Angela and her team were nothing short of exceptional. They orchestrated every detail seamlessly, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the joy of the day without a single worry. Angela's calm demeanor and unwavering support made all the difference, especially when this is your first wedding like it was ours.

Andréa was a life saver during wedding planning and I'm so happy we worked with her. She always remained calm, cool, collected and organized. I never felt stressed when I was around her. She has a calming aurora which is exactly what I wanted in a wedding planner. She is very experienced in event planning and has seen it all. She was able to help us plan the wedding of our dreams on 10.10.2020. We wanted a small wedding, focused on our love, and she understood that vision. It was great having her come with us to meet vendors because she would ask questions we never thought to ask. Andréa also would review the vendor contracts and make sure everything was right. She was always just a phone call, text or email away whenever I had a question or was feeling worried. I would definitely recommend anyone planning an event or wedding to reach out to Andréa for her experience.

Erin was amazing serving as our event planner and coordinator, helping us at every step of the way. We originally decided to work with Erin because she was very responsive, she was friendly in our introduction meeting, yet she managed to keep us on track. Striking a great balance between those three was very appreciated during every step of the process. We were planning our wedding remotely, so our opportunities to see venues and meet with vendors was limited. Erin contacted and set up many of these appointments for us and arranged for a very effective weekend. She accompanied us during the visits, and quickly set up additional appointments once she learned what we liked and disliked, until we finally found the perfect spot. The entire time, she was balancing our preferences and vision of the venue with our ideal budget - never pressuring us against either. Erin continued to keep us on task, informing us of recommended timelines, sending reminders, and always being willing to talk when we had too many questions for our regular emails. When we did need to communicate with vendors, she was always willing to join the conversation and advocate for us or share her perspective. Whenever we had an idea in mind, she would work to make it a reality. She wasn't affraid to share that a certain idea end up bad, but she always would present several ways to modify it slightly in a way that would fit a bit better. She was open to fun and quirky ideas, but was also happy with more traditional ideas. She was open and communicative in a way that made us feel very comfortable being open with her. For example, when we received a sample for the centerpieces, she made us feel comfortable saying that we didn't like them and we all were very comfortable making a different selection for the centerpieces. As the wedding approached, the emails, phone calls, and check-ins became more frequent, ensuring all final details were in place and ready to go. She made extra effort to help pick up items, deliver them to the venue, set up the tables, and design so many beautiful decorations that I didn't have nearly enough time to fully appreciate (but our guests did!). On the actual day of the wedding, everything went so smoothly, I had no concerns at all and was able to fully enjoy the day. I did notice a couple times Erin running around and ensuring things were happening flawlessly behind the scenes, and sure enough, everything was perfect. Thank you Erin!

Glamorous Weddings helped plan and coordinate my wedding. I could not imagine the day without Michelle. She truly made it perfect. I knew when I got engaged, I wanted to hire a coordinator to help execute the wedding day. Michelle does so much more. From the moment we started talking she started helping deal with planning tasks and making me think of many things I had not thought of. She had an answer to every question I had and many I would have never thought of. Throughout the whole planning process I always felt that I had someone I could go to and no question was deemed unimportant. Our rehearsal went so smoothly and everyone knew what to expect the day of. Michelle took much of the stress of wedding planning out of the planning. From the useful planning tools she provides to the very detailed timeline, everything is thought of. The day of the wedding, Michelle made sure that the bridal party and our family had absolutely nothing to worry about. She executed our vision perfectly for the decor. I walked out and saw our reception area and was stunned! The day was truly perfect down to the last detail and it would not have been anywhere as amazing as it was without Michelle and her assistant Carrie! When small issues arose, Michelle quickly took care of them without having it impact our day as the bride and groom. Talking with Michelle is like talking to a friend and having someone who so quickly feels like a friend be a part of such an intimate and important day truly makes a difference. I would recommend anyone I know getting married to work with Michelle and Glamorous Weddings.

It's safe to say that if we hadn't hired Kim and her team to help plan our wedding, it never would've happened! From the early stages of planning, Kim went above and beyond to make the entire process as easy as possible. Due to unique circumstances with my family, my parents weren't able to be as involved in the planning process as they would have been, and Kim stepped in and made sure that everything was taken care of, despite the difficulties taking place in our personal lives. I also live out of state, and Kim made sure to keep me in the loop about all details and meet with me every time I traveled back to the Cleveland area. Between check-in texts, words of encouragement, immaculate organization, and kindness, Kim really went above and beyond the call of duty. She had the perfect vendor recommendations to compliment my vision, and everyone she introduced me to was equally professional and talented. When it came to the day of our wedding, Kim and her staff handled everything. I had a friend ask me the next day what went wrong or not as planned during the wedding, and I truly had no response because Kim and her team took care of everything so that I could completely live in the moment. There are other planning groups out there, but none are as special as Kim, and I say that with complete confidence! She isn't just talented and professional, but extremely caring and kind. To me that's everything.

I am so glad that YPD and April were a part of my wedding day! My wedding venue had an additional wedding prior to mine and I was really concerned about having enough time to turn the chapel over and get my decorations up in time for the ceremony. Having YPD there was so helpful to get the chapel turned over quickly and so my family didn't even have to worry about it! Working with April leading up to the wedding was amazing! She was so helpful to make such a detailed timeline and answer all my questions! She also did beautiful wall draping at my wedding venue! Brittney and Angie were my day of coordinators and they were amazing!!! They made sure that everything was running smoothly! Ran to get me some food from the grooms suite when I was hungry, bustled my dress so I could take photos outside in the snow, unbustled it for the ceremony just to rebustle it again for the reception. Gave me lash glue when I forgot to bring some. They even braved the very cold weather and snow so that we could get pictures outside and made sure that I had blankets to be warm. They were so attentive and just wonderful! Everyone kept telling me that I was so calm and relaxed before the wedding, but it was really because of Your Perfect Day that I was able to relax and enjoy my day! See photos for draping that April did!

Working with Kirkbrides was the best decision we could have made when beginning our wedding planning journey. As soon as we got engaged, my mother-in-law said, “We need to call Vicki.” And I truly cannot imagine what our experience would have been like had we not had Vicki Hlousek as our planner. Vicki was our champion, confidante, friend and guide throughout the entire process, and she worked diligently to create an absolutely beautiful wedding weekend that was perfect for us. Not only beautiful in the design and details, but also in the sense that we were able to be present and soak in all of the sentimental moments of our wedding, knowing that Vicki and the Kirkbrides team were on the ball. The prospect of planning a wedding is intimating, but Vicki had an incredibly organized approach, walking us through each step and ensuring we were always on schedule. From logistics and coordinating with vendors to recommending stunning design ideas, Vicki always had a way of fighting for our vision and offering wonderful suggestions whenever we needed to switch gears. The wedding planning process was enjoyable and less stressful simply because we had Vicki by our side. And when we actually got to our wedding day - WOW! Seeing our reception venue come to life was such a special moment of the day. It was everything we pictured and so much more. This woman makes dreams happen! Vicki and the entire Kirkbrides team were thorough, thoughtful, incredibly professional and adaptable to any and all minor mishaps that a wedding day brings! From running back to our ceremony venue to pick up bedazzled shoes that were left behind for the reception, to fixing a button on the groom’s jacket minutes before the ceremony. My husband and I and both of our families felt so taken care of by Vicki and the entire team. We are still getting raving reviews from our guests about how heartfelt and fairytale-esque our wedding was, and that is such a testament to all of the hard work behind the scenes of the Kirkbrides team! We genuinely miss our daily calls with Vicki, but we are so excited for future couples to get to work with her and experience the magic of Kirkbrides.
