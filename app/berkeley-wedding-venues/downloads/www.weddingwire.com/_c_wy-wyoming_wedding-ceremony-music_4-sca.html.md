Met Alice at a bridal show in Laramie, and quickly feel in love with her personality! My husband and I met with her soon there after and decided she was a perfect fit for our outdoor wedding at St. Alban’s Chapel. She was familiar with the area and also familiar with where to set up for the wedding. Alice had a great selection of music to choose from, and came very prepared and rehearsed for our Monday wedding day. We have received SO many compliments from our wedding guests; I wouldn’t be surprised to see her show up at someone else’s wedding we know.

David was one of the only things I did not have to worry about before/during our wedding. His music is beautiful. He went from the classical guitar right into bagpipes. Very talented artist and a good guy!

Gretchen played the violin for us at our ceremony located at St. Alban's in the Snowy Mountains. She was great to work with, was very prompt in answering emails, and her cost was reasonable. She was on-time (early, even!), and didn't complain at all about the rain/snow mix and cold weather at our outdoor ceremony :) I would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a violinist (she can also have a pianist accompany her) in the Laramie area!

10/10 would recommend Strings51. They were so talented & accommodating. They elevated my ceremony & played beautifully! They took song requests & helped me make important decisions on my processional music. I truly enjoyed including them in our wedding day. I hope to be able to hear them play again one day!
