Excellent Experience 

We had a wonderful time working with the Skirball Cultural Center. The entire process was smooth and transparent. Monica was an exceptional coordinator/point of contact and answered all questions quickly and thoroughly. The venue itself it beautiful and was the perfect location for a late summer wedding.   
  
Thank you!

Truly unforgettable — Monica and the entire Skirball team made our wedding feel deeply personal and cared for

Planning a wedding is stressful under any circumstances, but planning one in Los Angeles while living in New York could have easily felt overwhelming. From the very beginning, Monica made us feel completely supported, heard, and taken care of.  
  
Right away, her communication stood out. No matter how small or detailed our questions were about logistics, timing, or venue options, Monica was always there with thoughtful, clear answers. Her responsiveness gave us so much peace of mind while planning from across the country.  
  
What truly showed us how special Monica is was how she handled unexpected challenges. When the California fires disrupted our tasting plans, she didn’t just adjust, she went above and beyond. Monica worked around our travel schedule, coordinated a private tasting, and made sure we were still able to experience and finalize our menu in person. In a moment that could have been incredibly disappointing and stressful, she made us feel prioritized and genuinely cared for.  
  
Throughout the entire process, Monica consistently shared her experience and insight in a way that never felt generic. She offered thoughtful feedback from past events and helped us personalize our wedding so it truly felt like us. She paid attention to every detail and treated our wedding as if it were just as important to her as it was to us.  
  
On the wedding day. even with last-minute pressures, Monica stepped in calmly and confidently, handling everything behind the scenes so we could simply be present and enjoy the moment. She did far more than what you would ever expect from a venue coordinator.  
  
We also want to highlight how exceptional the entire Skirball team was. From the waiters and waitresses to the bartenders, food logistics, and coordination staff, everyone was professional, attentive, and seamless throughout the night. Daryl and the full back-of-house team did a phenomenal job ensuring everything ran smoothly, and our guests felt genuinely taken care of from start to finish.  
  
The Skirball itself was stunning. Having our ceremony and cocktail hour outdoors with the reception indoors was perfect. The food was incredible (the sushi was a huge hit), and Monica even helped us bring our caviar bar vision to life which is something our guests are still talking about.  
  
At the end of the day, weddings are about how you feel and Monica and the entire Skirball team made us feel supported, understood, and truly celebrated. The entire event was joyful, seamless, and so much fun, and we couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out.  
  
We are endlessly grateful to Monica and the Skirball Cultural Center for creating a day we will remember forever. We couldn’t recommend them more highly.

Stunning and best wedding venue! 

We got married about three months ago and we still have family and friends tell us how much they loved the Skirball! Monica was amazing to work with. She was attentive, supportive and knows everything there is to know about having a wedding at Skirball. Monica was phenomenal, along with the entire staff. Everyone was professional, nice and so fun to work with with. I could not recommend this venue more for your wedding or special event!

Highly Recommend!

The Skirball as a venue was extraordinary, only being outdone by the service of their Wedding Event Team.   
The site is beautiful, with excellent options for the ceremony, reception, afterparty, and lots of photos. Afterparty was outdoors and went until 1am since there wasn't a noise ordinance.  
The flowers and trees around the site are an excellent backdrop for the occasion, as are the very stately buildings.  
I appreciated that the Ahmanson Ballroom was not a standard square ballroom, but a semicircle with lots of windows outside.  
Taper courtyard was a magical setting for the ceremony, with a gorgeous hillside as the backdrop.  
My wife and I had a long planning process, and the Skirball Team was happily along for the ride the entire way. Monica Reyes was a consummate professional. She was cheerfully responsive to my constant barrage of questions. And she was full of useful guidance whenever I asked. It was particularly clear during the food-tasting event just how much a natural Monica is in this role. She stood at the podium infront of a room of 200 people and provided clear instructions and plenty of levity. I'm incredibly grateful to Monica for the peace of mind and assistance she provided my wife and me throughout the process.  
The food was excellent, and the options were flexible. We mixed-and-matched sides with entrees, and got a little creative with the dessert offering. Skirball was very amenable to going off-script. And particularly noteworthy, they're incredibly good with allergies. They're very organized and accommodating to ensure all guests have an excellent meal, and you're not stuck offering a sad meal to guests with especially prohibitive dietary restrictions. I was impressed.  
I had originally heard of the Skirball on NPR, as a venue for fancy galas. When my wedding planner put Skirball on my list I figured they wouldn't deign to let a normal person like me host an event there. Not only was I wrong, it lived up to my impression as a place that can host classy affairs.  
If Skirball fits your criteria and your budget, absolutely go for it. You will not be let down. And Monica will make sure of it.

Thank you, Monica! 

We got married at Skirball in June 2025 and had the best experience working with this venue. Monica Reyes gave us our initial tour in February of 2024 and was so friendly. She sold on us the space as our venue for our wedding. We worked with Monica closely over that year to plan our wedding, and she was so great to work with. She was incredibly organized, thoughtful, and supportive as we worked through all of the logistics of our wedding day. Our actual wedding day was perfect, and we know a lot of that had to do with the team behind Skirball. Everyone was amazing, from the bartenders to the waitstaff to the chefs working in the kitchen. Thank you, Skirball, for everything you did to make our wedding amazing!

Amazing wedding venue

Skirball was a great place to have our wedding! The Taper Courtyard was such a unique and picturesque ceremony space with the lily pond and the Santa Monica Mountains in the background. There were lots of other beautiful areas to take photos. One of the things we appreciated most about Skirball was how streamlined everything was. They provided pretty much everything we needed: catering and bar, tables and chairs, dance floor, and even smaller items like easels and table signs - so we didn’t have to deal with outside rentals which was very convenient. The menu was AMAZING, with a lot of options for appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Our guests particularly enjoyed the sushi bar during cocktail hour and the dessert buffet at the end of the night, and everything else was also excellent. Our on-site coordinator, Monica Reyes, was so great to work with. She was responsive and made sure to address any questions or requests we had throughout the process. We are so happy we chose Skirball! It was a smooth planning experience and the event turned out even better than we could have imagined.

Wonderful Venue

We had our wedding here in February 2025. Our situation was a bit unique as we were having a Hindu wedding ceremony and an American reception. The Skirball Center (Monica) worked with us through it all to help make sure our needs were met. The service staff at the reception were beyond great and many of our guests commented on how friendly and fun they were. Our guests commented on what a beautiful and unique location it was and about how great the food tasted. We could not be happier!

Wedding Dreams into a REALITY

Pinch me, I’m still dreaming…  
  
My husband and I had a clear vision for our wedding: an outdoor ceremony surrounded by nature, followed by an elegant indoor reception. After scouting several venues, it was clear that Skirball was the one!  
  
The venue itself is breathtaking – a perfect blend of lush greenery, natural beauty, and refined elegance. The Taper Courtyard, with its stunning backdrop of the mountain and lily pond, is a picture-perfect setting for a peaceful and intimate outdoor ceremony. The Ahmanson Ballroom was equally impressive. Its all-glass design allowed us to have a sophisticated indoor reception with the most gorgeous view of the green mountain and trees in the distance. Our family and friends were blown away by how beautiful our wedding day was!  
  
We are forever grateful to the staff who made everything so seamless. Darrel was a fantastic guide throughout the planning process, ensuring that everything was on track and answering all my questions with patience and care. Monica was an absolute gem – she helped me finalize visual details that I was unsure about, and her expertise was invaluable.  
  
The food was exceptional – our guests couldn’t stop talking about how delicious everything was! The staff was incredibly attentive, making sure everyone felt comfortable and well taken care of throughout the event.  
  
One of the most valued moments of our big day was Darrel checking in on me, making sure I was doing okay and letting me know everything was going smoothly. This helped me come to my reality and truly absorbed the moments happening before my eyes. This was our special day, unfolding just as we had dreamed – surrounded by loved ones in the most stunning setting imaginable.  
  
Thank you, Skirball Cultural Center, for turning our wedding dreams into a reality. You truly made our big day unforgettable!

A Dream Wedding

We couldn't be more thrilled with our decision to have our wedding at the Skirball Cultural Center! From start to finish, everything about our experience was exceptional, and it truly made our day feel like a dream come true.  
First and foremost, the venue itself is absolutely stunning. The Skirball's unique combination of modern elegance and natural beauty provided the perfect backdrop for our ceremony and reception. The architecture and scenic views, paired with the gorgeous outdoor space, made for breathtaking photos and a magical atmosphere.  
A huge thank you to the amazing event staff, especially Monica, who went above and beyond to help us plan and execute our vision. Monica's attention to detail, calming presence, and expert guidance ensured that every element of our wedding came together seamlessly. We truly felt like we were in capable hands the entire time, and she played a huge role in making our dream wedding a reality.  
The service throughout the day was top-notch. While the cocktail hour food service was a bit slower than expected, everything else was fantastic. The staff was friendly, attentive, and professional, and they made sure we felt taken care of at every turn.  
We are so grateful to the entire Skirball team for their hard work, support, and dedication. Our wedding day was absolutely magical, and we wouldn't have changed a thing. If you're looking for a venue that offers both beauty and top-tier service, the Skirball Cultural Center is the place to be!

C+N Wedding - October 2024

Working with the Skirball Center and our venue coordinator Monica Reyes and her team was a dream come true. The venue is gorgeous, the staff were professional, flexible, and patient, and the outcome superseded our expectations in every way. The food was great, the bar service was impeccable, and the overwhelmingly positive feedback we received from our guests really highlighted the amazing experience shared by everyone. We cannot recommend this venue any more highly. Give these guys a shot at hosting your next event - you will not regret it!
