DJ George was an outstanding choice for our destination wedding in Cyclades. He traveled to Ios with absolute professionalism and supported us throughout the planning with expert guidance on music and especially lighting for dance floor using amazing fairy lights and chandeliers on arches for every table!! On the day, he delivered a seamless blend of sophisticated European and beloved US club sounds exactly as requested. Refined, attentive, and truly exceptional at what he does — we couldn’t recommend him more highly. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Mike and his team were absolutely awesome to work with in the lead up and on the day of our wedding in Naxos, Greece. Mike and DJ, Michael Gemenoglou kept the party alive all day and night at our wedding. Everyone had a fabulous time. Our guests commented on how great the lighting was (they provided fairy lights on the ceilings) and how the dance floor was always packed and music was spot on. Mike was very organsied in the lead up to the wedding, he provided a form that we filled with the music genres we liked, what we didn't want to hear etc. Mike and Michael accomdated all our requests including Sri Lankan and Irish music that we wanted to have playing too. It was exactly what we envisaged for our wedding day music and there were no issues along the way. We both truly appreciate Mike and his team's professionalism from the lead up to the wedding day to the actual day too. Although we live in Australia but had our wedding in Greece, it was still so easy to contact them through whatsapp and email, replying within 1 or 2 days and they were always open to discuss anything to do with our wedding. They truly made our lives eaasy for planning a destination wedding. Highly recommend to anyone.

i. Communication:- Very easy and flexible. Timos was very understanding of our needs and made sure he understood through clear and concise communication. ii. Collaboration:- Great collaborative approach. For instance: we were pleased when your team suggested better ways to ensure the party mood could be set up. iv. Timely Execution: Everything went on smoothly and in a timely fashion. Not for a moment did we feel that we could not depend on your team, even when we were personally not around. v. Music: Thank you for ensuring the party music would represent the mixing of two cultures and the music was a good balance of Indian and Western music so that all guests would feel included in the party. In conclusion, everything went perfectly well and as planned and you ensured our vision came to life. So thank you again Timos and Wedding Republic team. Nitesh & Jenny

DJ Athens is easy to work with, they helped us set the tone by asking simple questions and understanding the type of crowd we would host and our preferences. In addition, I found that they were good at reading the crowd and avoiding dives associated with choosing the wrong music at the wrong moment. Not an easy thing considering we had to entertain people with wildly different tastes.

Georgios is an outstanding DJ, playing best music for a wedding party. He is an excellent professional, with great understanding of our needs, exceptional communication and team working skills. He made us feel safe, that he will lead to a super party, and satisfy all of our guest, something which was finally achieved.

Christos was incredible. He played all the music genres we asked for, exactly as requested, without a single misstep and without ever disrupting the vibe. He read the crowd perfectly and kept the energy high all night long. Everyone danced, young and old alike, and it truly was the best party of our lives. We recommend him without hesitation.

Πραγματοποιήσαμε το γάμο μας στις 29/09/24. Ο Dj Άλκης έκανε το κέφι να ανάψει και δεν έσβησε ποτέ! Τραγούδια για όλα τα γούστα και όλα με μια όμορφη σειρά! Από την αρχή μέχρι τις πρώτες πρωινές ώρες της επόμενης μέρας η πίστα δεν άδειασε ποτέ και όλοι το διασκέδασαν!
