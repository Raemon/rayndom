Everything was so wonderful. We feel like we made the best possible choice by hiring you guys. The whole day went incredibly smoothly and all of the audio was perfect. Mike did a phenomenal job and was a pleasure to work with. His song choices were great and the dance floor stayed lively the entire night. I really appreciated how calm and collected he was. Thanks so much for contributing to our perfect day!

Bernie was FANTASTIC!!! He is extremely professional as well as organized. Bernie traveled a little over an hour one way to us on the day of his son’s graduation to provide his DJ services at our wedding. Bernie also helped out with duties outside of his responsibility on our wedding day out of the kindness of his heart. (helped set up chairs, made sure that the wedding party got to enjoy the cocktail hour appetizers, etc.). Bernie assisted us with a slideshow during the parent dances and was kind enough to throw in the use of his screen as we didn’t have one. He was very receptive to song requests and had the floor packed all night long! We truly could not recommend his services more and he is an all around good human. Thank you SO much, Bernie. We truly couldn’t have had such an amazing day without you! Dustin & Annie Bullock

We had an amazing experience using Top Hat Entertainment for our ceremony and reception at our wedding at the Old Lantern Barn in November 2025! Top Hat gave us a great price for our event and they were very responsive and helpful during our communications throughout the planning process. They helped me create an awesome mashup song for my father-daughter dance that was a crowd pleaser! We met with our DJ before the wedding over Zoom to check in about the schedule for the day, the songs for the ceremony, and the overall musical vibe for the night. DJ Rob absolutely delivered and we had such a great time dancing with our guests to music we loved all night long. We highly recommend using Top Hat Entertainment for your wedding!

DJ Evan Foley was a highlight of our wedding weekend, and we would book him again without any hesitation! We were married at a ski resort, and he was able to seamlessly move his equipment around several locations (top of mountain, cocktail hour, dining room, reception area, after party) without missing a beat. I had several people comment that DJ Evan Foley was the best wedding DJ that they’ve experienced, and several more comment that their legs were sore the next day from dancing so hard. Make sure you fill out his workbook with as much detail as possible, and then you can relax and trust that DJ Evan Foley to follow through professionally and ensure that the dance floor stays packed!

Tommy was absolutely amazing at our wedding! He handled the music for both the ceremony and the reception, which were about a quarter mile apart, and made everything run so smoothly. He played the right songs at just the right moments, and the flow of the night was seamless. His wife Jacki was also a huge help leading up to the wedding. She was super responsive and easy-going, and really helped with coordinating everything so we could focus on everything else. We knew we were in good hands the entire time. Out of all the vendors we worked with, Tommy and Jacki were by far the best. Highly recommend!

Evan was fantastic for our Fall 2025 wedding! Throughout the entire planning process Evan was communicative and flexible with what we wanted. We did not want a personality DJ as we wanted the focus to be on the music, and Evan did just that. He played all of our requested songs and then filled in the gaps with music that fit our vibe perfectly. He also made all announcements without taking the focus away from the speeches or from us. Our dance floor was lively the whole night and we had many compliments about how good the music and DJ were. Thanks so much Evan for keeping the vibes alive all night long!

Jim was recommended to us by our photographer. I could not imagine having any other DJ than Jim. He was so easy going, responsive, flexible, and made the entire experience stress-free and perfect. All our guests loved him, he kept the party going, and really set the perfect vibe for our wedding. He was on time with all his cues, played everything we ask, and was a pleasure to deal with! A month later, and we are still getting comments from friends and family about how great her was! I highly highly recommend DJ Jim Severance!!

We had Supersounds for our Fourth of July wedding 2025 and Buddy was the absolute BEST! The vibes were incredible from start to finish. He blended every style of music perfectly… my husband is big into country and I love remixes and rap, and Buddy somehow nailed the mix so everyone was on the dance floor all night. Just shows how fun, flexible, and easygoing he was the entire night. Thank you, Supersounds, for making our night extra special. The energy was amazing and we couldn’t have asked for a better DJ!
