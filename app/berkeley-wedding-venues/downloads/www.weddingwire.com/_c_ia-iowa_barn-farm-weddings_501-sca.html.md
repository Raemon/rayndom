This vendor is great at communication and answered all questions in a very timely fashion. Top notch venue with seriously the best service. The services at Walnut Ridge cannot be matched. The vendor goes above and beyond to help you with your wedding day from start to finish. Working with Walnut Ridge helped make wedding planning so stress-free and seamless when it came to the wedding day. This venue has both indoor and outdoor areas to use along with great getting ready suites, not to forget how gorgeous the whole place is. Cannot express enough how great this venue is and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a venue in 2024 and beyond!

The venue itself it just beautiful but the whole process from booking to wedding was very easy and everyone was accommodating. When we came to decorate before the wedding all the tables were set up exactly were need be with the tablecloths on so all we had to do was put décor out. Highly recommend this place!

I was having trouble finding a venue that looked beautiful and fit my budget! Then I came across this one! All the staff were so nice and also very crafty! I love the rustic and romantic vibes! It has a beautiful gazebo where you can say I do and you definitely should say I do at this wonderful venue!

We just had our wedding this weekend at the Schafer Century Barn. The venue is gorgeous! We actually had multiple guests tell us how much they loved it and thought it was the perfect venue. Susan was great to work with. She was super accommodating from the first time I contacted her up to the today. She checks in often leading up to the event and responds to emails, calls, and texts very promptly. We paid for the first package and added on unlimited ice, paper products, and staff. We did not pay for dust control, but they did it for us anyway which was super appreciated. There are just a few reasons I am not giving this wonderful venue 5 stars. The first one is that it's capacity is 200 people, but we had about 130 attend and it was pretty tight. We had a really hard time getting tables to fit for 130 and people were pretty tight even after we got the layout to work. Reason number two is the staff we paid for were not very helpful. Both my fiance and I went through with them the things we wanted them to do. We asked them to serve the food, keep up with emptying trash, keep tables cleared, and refill coolers with beverages both inside and outside. They served the food like we asked, but forgot to put both the coleslaw and pickles out until my dad finally realized halfway through the dinner that it wasn't out. Then within the first 10 minutes of the reception the coolers both inside and outside were pretty close to being out of beverages and my brother in law ended up having to refill them all. They kept up with emptying the trash, but did not clear tables at all like we'd asked. My grandma had to do it instead and she definitely shouldn't have had to. They were available when we had questions, but often didn't seem to know how to answer what we were asking. At the very end of the night only one staff member was still around which was fine by us, but when we were getting ready to leave, I needed to talk to him, looked for him for half an hour and he was no where to be found. Overall they were all very friendly and SEEMED willing to help, but we were very dissapointed. My last reason for not giving 5 stars relates not necessarily to the venue, but more to the Bridal Suite we booked. It was wonderful and provided plenty of space for my bridal party, but there was very little toilet paper to restock the bathrooms and there were only three mirrors in the whole place and they were in the small bathrooms so we had to buy some to get ready. Overall, our experience was great and if I were to go back to when I was selecting a venue I would still choose the Schafer Century Barn.

Wow! I had zero stress related to the venue for the wedding weekend! Cheyenne made sure that everything was perfectly set up, running and that there weren't things needed from her to make our day special. Even 16 days later and she is still checking in on us! Thank you for making our day the BEST. DAY. EVER! 10/10 RECOMMEND

Such a beautiful venue &we truly could not be more thankful.
