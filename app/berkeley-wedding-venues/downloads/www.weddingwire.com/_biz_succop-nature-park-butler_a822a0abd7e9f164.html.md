Located in Butler, Pennsylvania, just 30 minutes north of Pittsburgh, Audubon at Succop Nature Park is an outdoor wedding, celebration, and gathering venue where couples surround themselves with natural elegance and style. Vows may be exchanged in front of a picturesque pond, on the beautiful red brick walkway in front of the 1830s Marcraig House, or in an open field facing the woods that surround the property. Romantic and idyllic, these settings create a backdrop for photos that are timeless and irreplaceable. This enchanting property features over 50 acres of natural beauty where couples and their guests may view birds, butterflies, and wildlife.

From May through October, any wedding and reception, or special event, held at this property can accommodate up to 250 guests. Spend your entire event close to nature, starting with cocktails in the 1830 Marcraig House and private back patio, then taking in the beauty of peaceful nature trails before dancing the night away under the stars in our pond-side pavilion shelter. Whether you are planning a ceremony, a bridal shower, engagement party, rehearsal dinner, wedding reception, corporate party, birthday party, or other special event, you’ll find your perfect setting here.

During the colder months of November through April, events move indoors to the 1830 Marcraig House. During this time, we are able to host weddings or events of up to 60 people seated, or 100 in a mingling-style reception.

Our wedding package includes an exclusive rental of the 1830 Marcraig House and outdoor pavilion areas for the day, tables and chairs for reception and ceremony, a complete and customizable dinner buffet, and linen tablecloths and napkins. Venue and catering staff will be onsite to ensure the venue and all service-related needs are met on the day of your event. While we do not provide day-of coordination, we welcome you to hire a coordinator to assist you on your big day.

Audubon at Succop Nature Park provides in-house catering through Medure’s Catering which features a variety of food styles such as American, Spanish, Cajun, Italian, Indian, Mediterranean, and more. Dietary, cultural, and religious meal options are also available.

Wedding Day

Succop employees were so kind and easy to work with. This venue was extremely reasonably priced as well. The venue was so stunning and all of our guests loved it. Parking was very convenient and accessible, the staff placed signs which allowed our guests to easily find where they needed to park.

Beautiful, nature-filled, and easy to plan

We got married at Succop Nature Park in July 2023 and had an amazing experience. The staff was very helpful and responsive both leading up to the day and on the day of the wedding, helping the day go seamlessly. And of course it’s such a beautiful place! We also loved that it is part of the Audubon society and our deposit went to a good cause. We highly recommend them for any wedding or event!

Dream Venue!

Our wedding at Succop in May was an absolute dream! Davlin was fantastic to work with and was so quick to respond to all of my questions about the venue. It had the perfect spaces for every part of our wedding. From getting ready at the charming estate house in the morning, our ceremony in front of the pond, and the pavilion for our reception. This venue is perfect if you are looking for multiple spaces and for guests to be able to spread out like we did. It made me so happy to see our friends and family enjoying themselves playing games on the lawn, dancing under the pavilion, and exploring the grounds throughout the evening. Everyone raved about how beautiful and fun the venue was as well as how fantastic the food was through Medure's (their required caterer). I am SO glad we found Succop for our wedding!! I cannot imagine our day being as perfect anywhere else.

Exactly what I wanted

Looking for a venue was very hard when everything is either a banquet hall or a barn. I wanted a backyard style wedding and Succop was exactly that! The venue coordinator, Davlin, was phenomenal to work with. She was very responsive, informative, and all around excited to help in any way. You can tell that Succop Nature Park has a lot of wedding experience and they know exactly how the day runs. I did not have to worry about anything knowing that the staff their is experienced in weddings. The carriage house is absolutely beautiful, the ceremony location outside the house was exactly as I imagined, and the cocktail house on the porch was a huge bonus! I would recommend this venue to anyone else who is looking for a venue that is outside of the box!

Beautiful, Affordable, & Great Waitstaff

The photos on the Knot's website does not do justice to this location. There is a lot of key points on this property. There are : the green house, the barn, the willow tree, pond 1, pond 2, the provided arch, pavillion, and ofcourse the Marcraig house. The house itself has 2 suites with 2 rooms on each side, and a bathroom with shower + bath. We had a large bridal party and it could house all 40 people throughout the day comfortably. There are backup plans in place in case of poor weather, as the pavilion has drop down tent walls with windows. They do use an exclusive caterer of Medure's. However- I was very satisfied with them. Davlin & Medure's were very responsive throughout the entire process, and accommodating. The waitstaff was on point and very sharp. My only critique is that the dance floor is a little small, even with the additional seating that I purchased

The wedding of my dreams!

We had our wedding here in October and I can't possibly write enough about how beautiful it was! We've gotten so many compliments on the venue and the staff. I couldn't think of a better place to say "I do". This park just has a charm about it that you can't find just anywhere.  
  
Davlin was an absolute dream to work with! She was so helpful throughout our entire planning process and she answered every question we had about the park and how our day would go. They provide SO much and are so helpful!   
  
I didn't know about Succop prior to our wedding, but I will 100% visit, again and again, to walk the trails and explore more.

Perfect Wedding at Succop Park

This was the first wedding venue we looked at and the only one we needed to see! We absolutely loved the grounds especially getting married in front of the willow tree and taking pictures inside the greenhouse. Davlin was a superb help in getting all our details together and made planning from a state away in New Jersey as painless as possible. Lastly, how could we talk about how great a wedding at Succop is without mentioning their affiliation with Medure's Catering? Just like Davlin and everyone else told us, they are the BEST caterer in the area. We truly had a perfect wedding at Succop and highly recommend.
