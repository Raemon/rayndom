We eloped in June of 2023 and thus didn't need more than a bridal bouquet and groom boutonniere. We chose Briar Rose due to reading prior reviews, which were all excellent. Jean was very communicative and met my vision perfectly. I loved my bouquet so much that I kept it displayed in our hotel room(s) for our entire honeymoon! It was just so pretty. You won't be disappointed hiring this amazing florist! She is reasonably priced too! Thanks so much Jean! Wedding Photo: elisesterkphotography

Macy and the team at Born to Bloom created the most beautiful arrangements for my special day. From the moment I reached out just to get some initial information Macy was incredibly responsive. Throughout the whole process she took down my input to make sure I got exactly what I wanted. I can tell she takes her designs very seriously and I couldn’t be happier with the way everything turned out. It’s great when you can work with a vendor and trust that they are going to execute your vision with care and detail - especially when you have so many things to worry about during a wedding! I was able to enjoy my day fully with the most beautiful flowers as a backdrop to our ceremony and reception! Thanks so much Macy!

Keefe's is incredible to work with! I chose them as I had worked with them for other special events and have firsthand seen their beautiful designs. Monica was so easy and fun to work with. We gave her our ideas and inspiration with a price point, and she was able to create some stunning designs! She remained open and extremely flexible with us, making this part of planning far less stressful. We provided some greenery to Keefe's and they were able to elevate our designs to the next level! Keefe's designed and provided us a bridal bouquet, bridesmaid bouquet, boutonnieres and corsages, two toss bouquets, and center pieces. We received so many compliments on our florals, especially the bridal bouquet! It was absolutely stunning. Keefe's should be your go for not only your wedding day, but for any special occasions!

My review is WAY too late...by 2 years, but I just celebrated my second wedding anniversary and was browsing through my wedding photos and HAD to share! Sarah, I apologize this is so late! Sarah is the owner of Suite Blooms and Designs. She absolutely made my wedding day spectacular with the gorgeous Bridal bouquet, Matron of honor bouquet, and centerpieces for the tables. She far surpassed what I was hoping for when I sent her the images I found on pinterest for ideas...FAR surpassed it! She was so professional and went above and beyond what any florist should! On the day of my wedding, we had an issue with fit of the Matron of Honor's dress...she lost a lot of weight after her dress was altered and the dress kept falling down. Sarah immediately ran home and came back with matching ribbon. She created a lace up back on the dress so it would fit for the whole night. You couldn't even tell it was a fix! It looked so great! She already did an amazing job on the flowers, fixed my sister's dress, and then stayed around to help with whatever else was needed. I couldn't have been more grateful that I found Suite Blooms and Designs online! Sarah, thank you, thank you, thank you for ALL the hard work you did! Thank you for being amazing at what you do! And, again, I'm so sorry for the LATE review I had promised! You are amazing!

Myca with Whirly Girl Flowers was wonderful to work with for my September wedding. During our first meeting, she summed up our style as "Prairie Prehistoric" and ran with it! She did an amazing job incorporating touches from Jurassic Park, but also wildflowers and hints of blue to represent both my husband and I. She also included a yellow rose at my request in memory of my late grandmother. Myca's color palette guided the design for the rest of my wedding -- including the variety of dresses for my bridesmaids and the colors of the macaroons for dessert. Pro tip: Go the extra mile and pay for delivery and set up -- Myca did a FABULOUS job with this -- from setting up the arch to the tables in the tent, even decorating the dessert table and giving corsages, etc. to our parents, making everything that much more special (and stress free!).
