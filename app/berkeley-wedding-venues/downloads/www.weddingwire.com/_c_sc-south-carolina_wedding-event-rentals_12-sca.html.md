Happy to have discovered Hughes Event Rentals for our outdoor rehearsal dinner. They delivered a tent, tables with linens, and chairs on time, and clean. The owner even included a chandelier with the tent when we forgot that important touch for our evening party. Hughes is now our event rental go-to for Charleston, SC events. Thanks Mason and team!

I cannot say what a lifesaver this company was. It was calling for a downpour on our Saturday wedding and we called Tuesday afternoon, and they were able to help us. They were flexible and professional. They had the tent setup exactly as asked by Thursday. They even helped with deciding the tent size. The tent was affordable and exactly as described! Thanks to our contact there Luis!

My planner did all the communication and coordination - so I can't comment on that part, but everything seemed to go very smoothly, and we had no issues. There were so many different options to choose from, and they were very upfront about all the pricing. We didn't pick anything out until ~5 weeks before the wedding and there were no issues getting everything we wanted!

Synder Events made the wedding of my dreams a reality. They didn’t just provide rentals—they went above and beyond, even building a custom bar I had envisioned and naming it after my groom! Their dedication, creativity, and attention to detail are unmatched. If they didn’t already have what I wanted, they made it happen—truly next-level service. Working with them was an absolute dream, and I can’t recommend them enough. If you want a team that will bring your vision to life (and then some), Synder Events is it!

Tyler and the rest of the Event Rentals team were so wonderful to work with. I am a wedding planner, and had the pleasure of partnering with this team recently at the Lace House. Tyler was super quick to respond and make changes to event orders, was incredibly flexible (there were many things we had to change/add last minute), and went so above and beyond in troubleshooting logistics with me, and adding on a small fan less than 24 hours before the wedding. When they didn't have exactly what we were needing, Tyler even offered to drive to a Walmart to purchase one for us!! They have a wide variety of rentals, all for a very reasonable cost. They are excellent to work with!

They were everything we hoped for in rentals, timely, flexible and ultimately really came through with all the little details we needed for our big day.

We ended up renting some coolers for the rehearsal dinner and then linens for the wedding itself. They were great to work with and showed us a variety of options in-person with recommendations before we ordered. Easy pick-up and drop-off as well!

We used Rent a Party of Myrtle Beach to rent the chairs for our ceremony! The chairs were very clean and at a reasonable price. They were also able to accomodate our pick up and delivery times for us since we were coming from over 4 hours away!

We used these guys for their awesome custom decor rentals that we made for our wedding reception. Joanna (event producer) was awesome definitely had many ideas and showed us great pictures of past couples with ALL KINDS of decor ideas imaginable. Instead of a guestbook we had a polaroid photo book and "rented" a polaroid photographer for the night that took pictures of guests and put their photos in our book in the front of the reception. People loved it and we had a great time reading all the messages our guests left next to their picture! One of our favorite decorations at our reception was the 8 foot wide x 9 foot tall custom entryway sign designed by us that they created. IT WAS OFF THE HOOK! WE LOVED IT! I had sunflower centerpieces on each table, so to continue that decor, my husband and I suggested they create two large sunflowers on each side of a thin wooden arched sign that read "real 8-8-08" (our names put together and our wedding date) and the other side saying "all you need is love" (our ceremony exit song, beatles). They actually burned the words into the wood in a cursive type of font creating that rustic look, it was truly beautiful! If we had more more money and more room we would have definitely made more custom items! We highly reccommend these guys for your next event!

Very responsive to changes. But I did call more than once on the delivery day to find my order. It arrived at the last possible time promised, but if I had not pursued them, I think we would have fallen through the cracks. After pick up, they left me a message that one of the tablecloths had a burn hole in it. I'm quite sure it wasn't ours because no one smoked and candles were votives in heavy glass jars. I paid the $17.00 because I couldn't get more information. Not a big deal. I'd use them again, but I'd start calling early in the day to see if my order was loaded on a truck.
