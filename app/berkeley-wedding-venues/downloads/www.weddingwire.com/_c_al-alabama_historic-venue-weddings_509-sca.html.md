I booked the Lumpkin House for my December 2023 wedding and it was nothing short of amazing! The venue is absolutely gorgeous and has so many beautiful details. It is also in a convenient location near hotels. Warren and Madison (the venue owners) are wonderful to work with. Madison was my wedding planner as well. She handed every detail and made sure the day ran smoothly. She was so easy to work with and is a wedding expert!! She made my vision come to life! My wedding was everything I dreamed it would be and more. I highly recommend both the Lumpkin House and Madison as a wedding planner! (All photos by Hannah Miller Photography)

The Woodall was not our fist choice for our wedding, we had a major mess up with our original vendor and had to get rid of them, we should have hired Ryanne first!!!! She saved our wedding!!! This building is gorgeous, absolutely stunning!!!! Ryanne works very hard to make sure that it is perfect, even when she falls off a ladder and brakes her wrist while decorating for your wedding!!!!! It has everything that you need, two floors, no having to switch things around, and a beautiful courtyard outside, with another bar!!!! You must hire!!!!

Bridgestreet Gallery and Loft was the perfect venue for my wedding reception! I fell in love with the white walls, string lights, and the beautiful staircase. It is such a pretty venue, that you don't have to do a lot to it. Bo was very responsive and helpful throughout the whole planning process. The staff let us tour the venue for a couple of hours and talk through some things. They also let us drop stuff off the day before to make the day of easier. Overall, would definitely recommend!

This venue is large spacious, and provides tables, chairs, and a prep kitchen. Laurie was quick to answer any question and always had suggestions for vendors that work well with the venue. For the budget bride with a large guest list the venue cannot be more efficient.
