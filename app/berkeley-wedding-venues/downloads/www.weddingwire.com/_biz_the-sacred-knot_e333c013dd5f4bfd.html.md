Tami Harper

Tami just officiated our wedding yesterday. We really appreciate how personal she made the ceremony. We were able to spend time with Tami on Zoom prior to wedding to discuss exactly what we wanted. A non denominational Christian ceremony that truly was personal. Tami really listened. She was extremely flexible as we weren’t sure of our outdoor venue location until the day before the ceremony! Tami was kind enough to provide a copy of our vows and ceremony without us asking. Very thoughtful. Was great to leave filing marriage license with Tami.
