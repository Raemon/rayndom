Wedding at Martha-Mary Chapel, Reception at Eagle Tavern

As the mother of the bride, I cannot express enough how incredible the experience was - from the staff, to the location, to the food - it was all perfect. I attribute the success of my daughter's wedding (8/23/25) to our Event Manager Amy K. Because of Amy's professionalism, responsiveness, and patience with my daily and endless questions, I knew that the evening would be handled without a hitch. Our family and friends are still raving about the wedding service and reception.   
  
The location is iconic. The wedding in the Martha-Mary Chapel will always be foremost in my mind's eye - the chapel itself is special and beautiful. As they exit the chapel with the view of the Village Green and surrounded by family and friends, the newlyweds ring the bell cast by Paul Revere's son. That is another lasting memory.   
  
If you have a smaller guest list, don't be put off by the word "Tavern" in using the Eagle Tavern. The Tavern is iconic; the historic feel of the Tavern is part of the experience, especially for a couple who love history. We've all been to endless receptions at banquet halls, but staying with the historic nature of Greenfield Village made the night seem like a step back to a time and place where the gathering of family and friends was the special part of the experience.   
  
So with a beautiful and historic wedding service and reception location, you will want to consider the quality of the food: in short, incredible. One table called the chef over to ask how the braised short ribs were cooked to such perfection. It is also a touch of whimsy to offer options of iconic Detroit desserts such as Faygo Floats, it was a way to show a little local pride. Typically, no one remembers the wedding food, but in this case the food has been mentioned over and over to us.   
  
But again, I must stress that the Event Manager (Amy K) was incredible all during the planning, and the Banquet Manager (Jamie) made the reception itself run perfectly. This is entirely a point to my specific personality, but Amy could understand my humor, such that I did not feel like I was working with a distant staff just doing their job, but rather someone who understood how I handle the stress. The most important aspect is that my daughter and new son-in-law have repeatedly thanked us for putting together a wedding that far exceeded their dreams. It wasn't a wedding that depended on table decorations, favors, or little signs we made for various tables (gifts, favors, etc.), it was the experience of the surroundings - meaning it was not what you bring to the wedding to decorate, it is pre-decorated with the historic nature of Greenfield Village itself.

The Henry Ford Museum Wedding

We had an incredible experience at this unique venue. We were lucky enough to have Somer assigned as our event manager (I am positive the others are great too - but I am biased after the year we spend together) and she was PHENOMENAL. She was an essential resource for us. She had a quick answer for every question and provided sage guidance. As wonderful as the planning process was, our day of was absolutely perfect. I could not have asked for a more beautiful wedding or a better planning experience. Our guests have complemented us frequently on the quality of the food, as well as how cool they thought the venue was. I have and will endlessly sing the praises of this gorgeous venue.

5 Star Wedding… all thanks to Amy!

Amy K. was an impeccable advocate and partner during the entire experience. From day one, her and her colleague (Donna) made us feel like family. There was never a moment where we felt we were being upsold. Instead, they led us through the process with such care.   
  
The attention to detail was unmatched, and the wedding was nothing short of magical. We think about this wedding every day, and wouldn’t change a thing. This is THE place to choose!

Perfect Venue

The decision to have our wedding at THF was the best we could have made. The staff were so sweet and accommodating, and responded so quick to me when there were questions that came up. The food was amazing and very quick to serve. The guests loved the venue and we created a scavenger hunt for them to do during dancing if they wanted which most people enjoyed!

Fall Chapel wedding and Eagle Tavern reception

The Henry Ford was an amazing host for our September wedding. The Martha-Mary Chapel and Eagle Tavern are perfect complements that showcase the history of The Henry Ford. Our family and friends are still raving about the event; the venue, the food, and the overall experience. We would like to thank all of the staff who were involved in the process leading up to the wedding and the day-of team who made everything seamless. Our Event Manager, Donna, was fantastic and helped us to plan our dream wedding!

Beautiful July Wedding

The Henry Ford Museum is the perfect wedding venue for any time of year! My husband and I got married this past July and had the most amazing experience. All of the staff was friendly and helpful. Donna, our events manager made us feel so special throughout the whole wedding process and met with us to go over details as many times as we wanted to. The museum is beautiful and historic and there are so many spots throughout the venue for your guests to explore. Highly recommend THF!

2024 THF Wedding Experience

From the moment we visited the Henry Ford Museum, we knew it was the place for our wedding. The stunning location provided the perfect backdrop for both our ceremony and reception. Given that my husband comes from an automotive engineering family, getting married in the museum was not only memorable, but exceptionally unique. Guests were allowed to tour the museum throughout the reception, with many friends and family still telling us how much they enjoyed that experience.   
  
The THF staff was outstanding—professional, organized, and incredibly attentive. Our wedding coordinator, Samantha Saylor, made sure every detail was taken care of, allowing us to relax and enjoy our day. The versatility of the venue, with multiple beautiful spaces to choose from, ensured a seamless flow throughout the day.  
  
The catering was exceptional. Our guests raved about the braised short rib and chicken options, along with the flawless service. The team managed the timeline perfectly, so we didn’t have to worry about a thing.  
  
If you're looking for a venue with natural beauty, historical displays, incredible service, and attention to detail, the Henry Ford is the place to be. It made our wedding unforgettable!  
  
5 stars without a doubt!

11/10 Would Recommend 

We had our wedding at Lovett Hall in October. Words don’t do justice how AMAZING the entire Henry Ford staff is. Our venue coordinator, Aileen, was absolutely great and really brought our vision to life. She was very responsive, helped with ideas, and very flexible to changes. She really wants your day to go exactly how you envision. Our catering staff was also great, food was brought out promptly and it was. so. good. Our guests still rave about how good all the food was. Absolutely recommend adding the Downtown Dessert package to your day- it was a hit! Wish we could do the day all over again!
