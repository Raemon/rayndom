I recently hosted my third bridal shower at Boundary Oak, and once again, it was absolutely flawless. At this point, I’ve become something of a serial matron of honor (dear lord, no more... I say that every time), and each time I’m tasked with planning a shower, I know exactly where to go. Boundary Oak has become my go-to for a reason. The venue is beautiful, the setting is perfect, and most importantly, the team is truly exceptional. Angelique and the staff are incredibly professional, responsive, and thoughtful in every step of the process. They make planning easy, even when you’re juggling a hundred other wedding-related tasks. The space is bright, elegant, and adaptable for any vibe you're going for, and the views never fail to impress. The food is always a hit: fresh, well-presented, and something guests actually talk about afterward. And the staff during the event is just as amazing as the planning team: attentive, friendly, and on top of everything without being overbearing. After three showers here, I can confidently say that much of the praise I get for these events really belongs to Boundary Oak. They consistently deliver a smooth, high-quality experience that makes me look like I know exactly what I’m doing, even when I’m just trying to survive another round of bridal duties. If you're planning a bridal shower (or any celebration, really), I can’t recommend them enough. I’ll be back again... though hopefully as just a guest next time.

We loved our reception room. It was beautiful! The room was decorated as we had discussed. Our reception started at 1730 and the sun was quite bright on the stage area. This left some of guests a little blinded with no solutions. The food was delicious! But they were not going to bend on spending money on food and beverage. Overall, it was well worth our money.
