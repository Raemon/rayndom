I do not have enough words to describe the care and love my husband and I received from Deanna. She made us feel so comfortable during one of the most intimate and important moments of our lives. She also helped me bustle my train, and helped carry the weight of my veil at points. I immediately knew I made the right choice the moment she walked into the room. She radiated warmth and joy, and made our day truly unforgettable. I would absolutely recommend her services!

We knew we picked the right person during our first meeting with Keith. He took the time to get to know us and what we wanted. He had open communication with us via phone, email and ZOOM. All of our guests enjoyed the ceremony because Keith's script was heartfelt, not too long, and he allowed for my now husband I to truly shine. We are so happy that we hired Keith because he made our wedding day absolutlely perfect!

Drs. Lorraine and Michael have left a lasting impression on my husband and I. Through counseling, they helped us develop practices that we utilize throughout our day to day interactions with one another. During the wedding rehearsal/ceremony, they made us feel confident and comfortable under their guidance. We are so grateful for meeting them both and for the growth that has transpired within our relationship due to their suggestive practices. If you're looking for God fearing people who are also down to earth and real about life, this is the couple for you! I would recommend anyone to book both Dr. Lorraine and Dr. Michael for pre-marital counseling and to officiate the wedding. SN..when they say "they've got you"...THEY MEAN IT!

As wedding planner, we always seek to find personable ministers/officiants who really care about our couples. I met Dr. Taylor at the day of the wedding he was going to officiate. We had to move the ceremony indoors and he was super flexible and understanding of the hectic moment. He just waited to get our updates. His ceremony was very meaningful and very special for our couple. Everyone had a comment about the service! Thank you Ken for your dedication in making our couples ceremony special! Highly Recommended by Smooth Tie The Knots.

We really enjoyed working with Megan for our Pre-Marital counseling sessions. Megan made us both comfortable and not only were the sessions structured, but also catered to our needs when we veered off the structured path. The responsiveness was a little slow, but she was very flexible when we needed to reschedule an appointment. We are so happy that we participated in the pre-marital counseling and are definitely thinking of continuing with Megan just because we really enjoyed her as a counselor.
