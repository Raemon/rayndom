## Wedding Decorations

While the true beauty of your wedding will come from the love you and your partner share, you still want to create an unforgettable event. To do that, you may need the help of a wedding decorator and lighting specialist. While certain venues have their own unique shine, others look best when a professional helps you create the ambiance you’re after. Wedding decorators can help you style a wedding the way you want with unique decorations and beautiful lighting that will add an extra glow to your special day.

## What Do Wedding Decorators Do?

In the wedding world, there tends to be a lot of confusion between the terms “wedding decorator,” “wedding designer” and “wedding stylist.” These terms are often used synonymously. It also doesn’t help that certain [wedding planners](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planners) offer design assistance, while some wedding designers fashion themselves as stylists and decorators as well.

For the sake of clarity, a wedding designer is typically someone who helps you develop the overall look, theme and vision of your wedding. Many wedding planners fill this role or offer design services. A stylist is that charismatic and creative soul who will set up all your decorations at the venue, turning your vision into a beautiful reality. Again, some wedding planners and even florists offer styling services.

That brings us to the wedding decorator. A wedding decorator is a company or individual that offers decorative pieces or decorative services, like lighting. You may not be surprised to learn that some wedding decorators also offer design and styling services.

## Do I Need a Wedding Decorator?

Does your wedding vision include glamorous chandeliers hanging over the dance floor? Do you want twinkling lights to guide you down the aisle? How about a spotlight for your first dance and those big speeches? Many wedding decorators offer lighting services that can help your event shine. They may also provide additional decorative pieces that will create exactly the right ambiance. (Want to find some great design and lighting ideas for your wedding? Browse our [real weddings](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/real-weddings) section to see what other couples have done.)

If you are holding your wedding in an outdoor [venue](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-venues) or a place without adequate lighting, a wedding decorator is a great option. They can come in handy for [park weddings](https://www.weddingwire.com/park-weddings), [beach weddings](https://www.weddingwire.com/beach-weddings), [garden weddings](https://www.weddingwire.com/garden-weddings), tent weddings, [barn weddings](https://www.weddingwire.com/barn-farm-weddings) and more.

## How Do I Find Wedding Decorators Near Me?

At WeddingWire, we can help you find a great wedding decorator near you. Use our search feature to sort wedding decorators in your area. You’ll find that many offer a variety of design and styling services. Check out customer reviews to learn more about what each offers and make sure you are clear about what you want when you give them a call.

Your wedding will shine as brightly as your love with a great wedding decorator on your wedding planning team.
