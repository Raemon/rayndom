We used their cupcake ferris wheel and a few of their giant games. They games were a huge hit as most of my family are not big dancers and the kids were entertained the whole time! The games were so much fun and were so elegant because they were hand made and not the plastic stuff you can get at the store. Joan delivered the rental items and picked them up right after the wedding which made renting the items so easy!!

I loved working with Dirty Dishes. Our wedding reception was held in a church parish hall, a fairly simple venue with multipurpose tables and little decor. But the beautiful place settings provided by Dirty Dishes elevated the whole look. Sue was so easy to work with: prompt in communications, an easy partner for thinking through logistics, and she worked seamlessly with the caterer. It was very important to us to have an eco-conscious event; I am so glad we didn't have to set up or clean up and could just enjoy the elegance.

I hired Julia and I am so glad I did. She did our decor design and SPECTACULAR is an understatment. Julia's decor was the perfect, classy and eye catching touch for our event! She executed an amazing design and working with her made the preperation for the event so much smoother! I am so happy with what she did and I can't wait to work with her again for any of my decor needs!
