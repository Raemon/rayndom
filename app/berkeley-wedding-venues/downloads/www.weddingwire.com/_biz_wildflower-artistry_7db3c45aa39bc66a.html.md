Save your time searching and just choose Amber!

After doing my research on live painters, the easiest choice was picking Amber! Through other paintings on her page, I saw how she brought so many couples' special days to life by capturing all the important details.  
We wanted our wedding picture to be with our dog Moose after we said our 'I do's,' and the painting turned out perfect! There were some details that I didn't even mention to Amber that she captured in the painting, which I didn't even notice until later when I looked at it closer.  
My grandma recently passed away, and I wanted a piece of her with me. So, I incorporated her pin into my veil, and Amber included that detail in the painting. Now, when I look at the painting, I also see that detail that reminds me of my grandma! We keep that painting by our front door. So it's the last thing we see when leaving the house, and the first thing we see when we come home.There are not enough words to explain how thankful I am for the work Amber did for my wedding!  
She captured this moment in time better than I could have ever asked for, and I highly recommend choosing her to paint your next special moment!

Wedding painting

I think my request for a live wedding picture was Amber’s first and boy did she hit it out of the ballpark. The painting was a present to the newlyweds and they were overjoyed with the end project. Amber arrived at the venue and immediately began working on the project. She worked during the ceremony into the reception to finish the absolutely beautiful piece. Amber has a God given talent that she loves to share and create beautiful and special items.

Live Wedding Painter 

I cannot recommend Wildflower Artistry enough! Amber was an absolute joy to work with from start to finish. She was quick to respond, incredibly thoughtful, and made the entire process feel effortless. From our first interaction, it was clear how much she truly cares about her clients and their special day.  
  
Her artwork is absolutely stunning, not only because she’s incredibly talented, but also because she pours so much heart into every piece. The live wedding painting she created for us is something we will treasure forever. It perfectly captured the magic of our day and brought it to life in such a personal and meaningful way.  
  
Amber’s bubbly personality and genuine kindness made the whole experience even more special. She’s not just an artist—she’s an excellent vendor and someone you’ll be so glad to have as part of your wedding journey. If you're considering a live wedding painter or custom piece, don’t think twice—book Wildflower Artistry!

The perfect picture 

I would and still do recommend Amber and wildflower artistry to any and everyone I can . When I first booked this service it was just something extra I wanted on my wedding day but her work and her piece was so much more then that . She exceeded all of mine and my husbands expectations and gave us something to cherish forever . She was quick with responses , she put together my vision even more then what I thought it was going to be . If you’re considering having a live painting done , do it , don’t second guess it because it is so worth it and she is who you will want to use .

Amber is awesome!

I met Amber at another wedding and grabbed her card. For my daughter’s wedding, she exceeded expectations. Everyone was so impressed, and the painting turned out great. Daughter #2 is getting engaged soon, and I will be booking Amber as soon as as a date is set.

The absolute best! 

Amber blew us away with our live painting from our wedding day, it was more than we ever imagined.

Amber was so easy to work with throughout the whole wedding planning process. I am so thankful for a beautiful keepsake I will cherish everyday for the rest of our lives! I highly recommend Wilflower Artistry to anyone!
