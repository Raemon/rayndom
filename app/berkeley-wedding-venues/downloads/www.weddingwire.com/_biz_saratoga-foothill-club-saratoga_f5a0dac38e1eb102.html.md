Beautiful Venue!

My husband and I hosted our wedding at the Foothill Club and had a great experience! The venue is stunning and had plenty of space for our large party + a dance floor. It is also conveniently located next to charming downtown Saratoga. The catering option was excellent and the venue staff were responsive and helpful. A must see if you're getting married in the Bay Area!

Lovely, historic Bay Area venue

We looked at a ton of venues throughout the Bay Area to host our wedding reception and are so glad we picked the Saratoga Foothill Club. It is a lovely, historic space and it had all the amenities we needed to throw a great party for ~100 guests.

Excellent Experience 

I attended a wedding reception at the Saratoga Foothill Clubhouse, and it was an unforgettable experience from start to finish. The venue's charm and beauty set the perfect backdrop for the celebration, with its picturesque surroundings adding a touch of magic to the evening.  
  
The catering was nothing short of excellent, with a diverse menu that catered to all tastes and preferences. From the hors d'oeuvres to the main course, every dish was crafted with precision and flair, leaving guests raving about the culinary delights.  
  
What truly stood out was the responsiveness of the event management team. They went above and beyond to ensure that every detail was taken care of, from coordinating seating arrangements to accommodating special requests. Their professionalism and attention to detail were evident throughout the entire event, making it a seamless and enjoyable experience for all.  
  
Overall, I had an incredible time at the wedding reception. The combination of the stunning venue, delectable catering, and attentive event management made it a night to remember. I would highly recommend the Saratoga Foothill Clubhouse to anyone looking to host a memorable event.

The Saratoga Foothill Club is the cutest little place and the staff there is amazing. We had our ceremony here and It was wonderful. They also provided appetizers for our guests before they headed up to the reception venue and the food was delish! The accommodated all my off-the-wall ideas and were a pleasure to work with. If you're going for a vintage or historic theme for your wedding this would be a great place. Plus its smack in the middle of the cutest historic downtown so there are plenty of great photo opps.

Beautiful wedding venue 

This was a beautiful venue with most things included (cake, food, service, DJ). We liked that fact. The only complaint we had was the professionalism of the planner. She was nice to the bride but others observed not such a great attitude.
