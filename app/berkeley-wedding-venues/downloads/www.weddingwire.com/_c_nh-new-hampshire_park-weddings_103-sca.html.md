After scouting tens of New England summer camps and touring a handful, Camp Cody stood out as the premiere spot for our wedding. The grounds are well maintained, the cabins are heated, the camp is right on the water. From there, things only got better. From our first coordination meeting through our final check-out, the staff was so friendly and accommodating. We must add that the food was spectacular. We received compliments from many guests (we had about 140) about both the reception dinner and the other optional meals that are available as part of the package. Huge thanks to Caitriona, Dora, Angie, and the whole Camp Cody crew.

The SLNSC has always held a special place in my heart, so it only made sense that we got married there. Not only was Joy a delight to work with (and incredibly helpful and accommodating), but the Kirkwood Gardens were GORGEOUS and gave us plenty of space for our 80 guests. We also were able to fit two food trucks beside the barn that our guests loved. And who could say no to taking pictures on the trail with the animals?! If you're looking for a unique venue where you'll feel close to nature and wildlife, the Science Center is IT.

Diana Jacobs of the Harris Center for Conservation Education located in Hancock, NH was wonderful to work with. They have strict rules at the Harris Center, and for very good reason, it is important to respect the neighbors and environment. However, they tried their best to be flexible in allowing us to put up our sailcloth tent in an area that is not normally used for weddings. They even trimmed back some trees in order to make sure that it would fit. The morning after our wedding when my husband assured her that we would be there by 9:00am (yeah right!) Diana helped to clear off all of the tables and put all of our belongings in a single room so that the tent rental company could pack up. It was magical and all of our guests said that this was the most unique wedding they had been to. I would just not suggest you let your florist sprinkle petals on the grass... you will be responsible for picking all of them up!!

The Gardens was only the 2nd venue my husband and I toured. As soon as we arrived and took a look around the beautiful gardens we knew it was our wedding venue. The team at the gardens were so easy and helpful during the planning process. Whenever I had a question they immediately responded! They were a pleasure to work with! As for the day of, it was honestly something out of a fairytale! We had multiple guests come up to us and tell us it was the most beautiful wedding they’ve ever been too! We lucked out and had gorgeous weather which we are so grateful for! But even if it had rained I know it still would have been beautiful! I can’t thank the team at The Gardens enough for giving us our dream wedding!

This was the best experience we could have asked for! The site, staff and services were out of this world. If you want a camp environment with outstanding views, this camp is for you. We housed all our friends, fed them for the weekend and no one had to worry about driving home. This was an epic place.

We would 1000% recommend Windsor Mountain. The camp is beautiful, but we have to start with the staff. Gabby, our point person, was the kindest and most thoughtful human. We loved working with her. When we first toured the camp, we were sold not only by the setting, but by the fact that we would get to plan our weekend with her. In the months leading up to the wedding, we had a few meetings with Gabby to go over details and talk through our vision. She shared a full Google Drive for us with FAQs, room spreadsheets, food menus and more. We also attended a food tasting in the summer and got to tour the camp again. On the Friday morning before the wedding, we met with her and handed off everything. She and the entire camp staff took it from there so we did not have to think about a single thing all weekend. We had a perfect weekend. The staff were incredible, the food was delicious and our guests had so much fun. The location itself is stunning. The lake, the trees, the ceremony site, the cabins and buildings, open fields etc. made the entire camp feel peaceful, scenic and special. The lakefront treehouse for the couple to stay in is also beautiful. They have a solid rain plan, they worked with us to stay within our food budget and the activities are endless. There are a variety of cabins for guests and a house for those who may need extra amenities, such as elderly guests or parents with infants. Guests loved having access to the lake, zip line, ropes course, walking trails, etc. Windsor Mountain is amazing and we are so grateful we chose it.
