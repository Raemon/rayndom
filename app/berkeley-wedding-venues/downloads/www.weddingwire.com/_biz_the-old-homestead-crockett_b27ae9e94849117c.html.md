Awesome Experience!

Beautiful venue for a wedding and reception! Gorgeous gardens, large deck area, access to indoor areas of a lovely historic home. At night, the outdoor cafe string lights make for a beautiful ambience. I acted as wedding coordinator for a family member's recent wedding, and Tracy, the venue coordinator for The Old Homestead, was a dream to work with! Super friendly and helpful...having her there during the event was like having a friend there to make sure everything went well. This place is a hidden gem...highly recommend!

Hidden Gem!

The old homestead is truly a hidden gem. It is absolutely perfect for an intimate wedding (we had around 40 people) but it can certainly fit a bigger group. This was by far the best value I found when looking for venues and I received endless compliments from guests. If you are even considering this venue just make the jump and book, you wont regret it!

The Old Homestead is a wonderful, wonderful venue. The house is classic and beautiful but feels totally updated and comfortable (none of the electrical/plumbing/ air conditioning issues I often see working in charming old spaces). The garden is lovely, the space is intimate, but most importantly, the team at the Old Homestead is phenomenal. Keri, Micheal, and Maureen were fantastic to work with, really going above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. I can't recommend The Old Homestead Highly Enough!

I fell in love with the location while attending my niece's wedding last summer. After 10 years my fiancé and I decided to tie the knot. We looked at other venues out of curiosity, but nothing even came close to The Old Homestead for value, atmosphere, and customer service.  
My initial contact there was Keri, the event coordinator. She is so nice! I love her to death!! She agreed to meet with me at a local coffee shop where she answered all of my questions and literally held my hand and walked me through the entire process every step of the way.   
Maureen, the Event Staff Leader has many years of experience and has organized hundreds of weddings. It was evident on how professional and efficient she was in managing the set up and tear down of the event.  
Although we had our wedding catered by a friend who is the manager of restaurant, Maureen also is a successful caterer should you decide to use her.   
We chose to use the lighting company affiliated with the Old Homestead, they have an optional chandelier that we rented along with the lighting. The results were phenomenal, the lighting really sets the mood and gave it an amazing ambiance.   
We lucked out, I believe we were the second couple to be married at the venue after it had undergone a major facelift. It was beautiful before, but now I can't even describe how simple yet refined the garden is. The ladies from the Carquinez Women's Club really do a great job maintaining the property, their love and passion for gardening couldn't be more evident.  
I can't express the gratitude that I feel for everyone evolved with the Old Homestead. Our wedding was so special, it really was the best day of my life.. like a real life fairy tale. I will remember it for the rest of my life as though it was yesterday.  
  
God bless.

We had a beautiful June wedding at The Old Homestead! As a young couple, we were looking for a small venue to accommodate our closest friends and family and The Old Homestead was perfect! We feel in love with the venue right away! The backyard was the perfect little paradise after the new landscaping project was finished and we were lucky enough to benefit from it. The staff was kind, helpful, and hospitable. We couldn't have imagined a better venue! Thank you!

The Old Homestead is an amazingly beautiful venue and you couldn't ask for a better team to help you plan your event-from securing the date to staging and helping to coordinate outside vendors for lights and catering. Thank you all so much!
