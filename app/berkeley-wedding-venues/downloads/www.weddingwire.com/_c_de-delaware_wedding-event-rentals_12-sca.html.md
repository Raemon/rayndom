Delaware's Diamond Lounge was a great company to work with. They came to our Trunk or Treat (where we have over 1,000 participants) with their toilet trailer and it was a huge help! They were friendly and professional! Definately recommend :)

We cannot recommend Coastal Tented Events highly enough! We rented a tent, tables, chairs, bathrooms, and all serviceware for our wedding, and they transformed an empty farm field into the most stunning wedding venue—more beautiful than we could have dreamed of. Kathy, our main contact, was an absolute dream to work with. She took the time to fully understand our vision and was incredibly patient as we navigated decisions and changes. We trusted her completely—she worked within our budget, gave us clear guidance on what was essential and what wasn’t, and provided fantastic recommendations for other vendors. Her expertise and kindness made the planning process so much easier. The installation and breakdown teams were equally exceptional. They were professional, efficient, and left the field looking as though a wedding had never taken place. If you’re looking for a company to handle your event rentals with care, professionalism, and an eye for detail, Coastal Tented Events is the way to go. Thank you, Kathy and team, for helping make our day perfect!

We go the margarita machine for our wedding. Not only was it a hit and the highlight of the drinks we had, but Kevin was great to work with. We spoke ahead of time to go over everything and he had the machine set-up and ready to go exactly when we needed it.

We were very happy with Kevin at Action Rentals. He was fun to work with, very reliable and had great ideas to help make our daughter's wedding at Hunter Barn just perfect! He was on site early to run the heaters and even acted as door man to slide open the heavy door for guests.
