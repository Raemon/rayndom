The Historic of Centreville, nestled in Centreville, Michigan, is a wedding venue that celebrates its 19th-century grandeur and 21st-century elegance. This veteran-owned building was first constructed in 1865 and was originally a distinguished hotel for local dignitaries and travelers. Now, this setting has been carefully restored, transformed into an exclusive event location that offers couples historic charm and contemporary features.

**Facilities and Capacity**

Once you set foot on this property, you will marvel at its timeless elegance. The Historic of Centreville boasts its original brick façade that tells a story of years gone by, while still being beautifully preserved, creating a dreamy backdrop. The wrought iron handrails, which guide you to the impressive wooden double doors, hark back to the Victorian era, adding to the romance. Exchange your vows in the Wedding Chapel, an intimate space which once was the hotel's private library. The natural light spilling in will add a golden hue to all your memories and cherished photographs. After tying the knot, you can capture the newlywed bliss while your loved ones meander to the refined lounge, purposely designed for mingling and enjoying cocktails. Featuring vintage leather seating and classic bar carts, everyone is sure to be charmed by the ambiance, further enhanced by soft jazz or classical tunes flowing from hidden speakers. The jewel in The Historic's crown is the grand ballroom. Countless soirées have been hosted here since it first opened two centuries ago, and yours is sure to sparkle. You will be in awe of the original hardwood floors and dazzling chandeliers hanging from the tall ceiling. Receptions of up to 75 guests can be held here. 

**Services Offered**

The team at Historic of Centreville consists of dedicated local partners who are passionate about excellence. They welcome couples to choose outside caterers for a truly tailored experience. Your culinary experts can make use of the reception kitchen, which features stainless steel counters, refrigeration, and a staging area. Your loving celebration can enjoy a piece of history as you say "I do" and begin your happily ever after.

Such a GEM for our community!

The Historic is a beautiful event center! The best people to work with, hands down. It’s wonderful to see this historic hotel building restored beautifully and available for the community to use for small events. Highly recommend!

Perfect venue! 

This venue was beautifully done. It’s a mix of history and charm, with some modern touches. Hosts are very responsive. This venue was perfect for our gathering, plenty of room, and spacious kitchenette, with table and chairs set out for our group.

Amazing Experience 

I attended the Dueling Piano Night and it was incredible from start to finish. The energy, talent, and crowd interaction made for such a fun evening! I love how the venue keeps the charm and history of the old building while blending in modern style and comfort — it’s the perfect mix of vintage character and vibrant nightlife. Can’t wait to come back for another event!
