I work at a music venue in downtown Denver and have worked with Ensueño for about three years now. The first time he played our venue I had to have him back. We host A LOT of DJ’s - so when one person stands out that brightly among the rest it’s extremely noteworthy. He’s fun, entertaining, extremely high vibes and energy, transitions are seamless and - above all - he can read the room. That’s of utmost importance ESPECIALLY in an event/wedding setting. His sets have always been relevant to what people want to hear and he can pivot on a dime based on crowd reaction. Genuinely one of the best DJ’s in Denver, I’m lucky to have him as a regularly booked DJ at our venue and I can’t imagine a world in which he disappoints at your next wedding or event!

We can't say enough about Suit & Tie DJ's. They made our special day more than we could have ever expected. Easily the best night of our lives! Tyler kept everything running smoothly and boosted the vibes with dancing awards and his overall skills. Having Nikki and the photo booth added the extra chef's kiss to the entire night. Highly recommend Tyler and adding on the photo booth with Nikki to make your day/night everything and more. Thea and Janet

I can't say enough good things about Colorado Wedding Productions, especially Carl! He was so helpful, organized and professional when it came to our wedding. In the months leading up he was very communicative and always happy to answer any questions we had. On the day, he went above and beyond to keep the evening flowing and the vibes high. Plus, he's just a super cool dude! We would hire them again in a heartbeat. :)

I was so stressed about picking the right DJ from my wedding while planning. Casey made the process seamless from start to finish. Even from our initial consultation we felt great about his energy and expertise in being the emcee for a wedding event. The online planner was very useful and helped to plan out little details I hadn’t even thought of while planning the wedding timeline. Throughout the whole night he was helping run through the timeline on schedule and make sure things were happening the way they were supposed to. The mic setup we had for our outdoor ceremony went perfectly. I had heard lots of brides on different pages talk about how at their weddings their DJ (from another company) had played the wrong songs/didn’t follow their requests. The whole night I was hearing songs from our list we gave him as well as the appropriate filler music for moments we hadn’t picked out music for. The entire night he had a crowd of people dancing around him and he really knew how to keep the energy up. Even at the end of the night after our last dance (while everyone was outside lined up for our send off) he came over to see if we needed anything and actually grabbed my husbands stuff so he could do the send off hands free of his phone/jacket. He really took care of all the little things in between. Look no further, this is the best DJ for your event! Thank you Casey!

Discosapien was the BEST decision we could have ever made for our wedding day. The music was perfectly curated for us and our style of music and there was never a dull moment. Rex did such an amazing job at blending our favorite music and our guests favorite music while creating a party atmosphere without it being very basic wedding songs that anyone could just play off of the phone. I searched high and low for the best DJs to perform at our wedding because music is one of the most important things, especially to my husband and I, and we were truly not disappointed!

We loved worked with Stage One for our Oct. 2025 wedding at Woodlands Colorado! Darrell, Tara, and their family were so professional, fun, and helped make our day extra special. Admittedly, we procrastinated on picking our special dance/moment songs, but Darrell did not sweat it for one second. For our first dance, there were specific verses/choruses that we wanted to use and Darrell was able to cut the song to how we hoped for. He even made a special remix of “YMCA” and “Hot To Go” that we had talked about during our planning meeting. We also used their photo booth and it was one of the highlights of our reception. Everyone had a blast taking photos! The whole day came together beautifully and Darrell/Stage One was a huge part of that. He kept the party going until the very end and we can’t recommend him enough!

Cyrus and Zach were the absolute best. Cyrus played amazing music all night long and even went above and beyond in making sure my husband and I were fed and always had cold drinks in our hands. He was spectacular. Zach was our photographer and did such a stellar job at getting all the photos I wanted and making me feel special and beautiful every step of the way. I am a bride who hates to be photographed and I wasn’t really looking forward to being the center of attention but Zach made me feel reassured and comfortable at every step of the way. When I came to him with an idea for photos he was 1000% on board and I cannot wait to see the final results. I can not thank these two men enough for being apart of our special day and making us feel so amazing. Cyrus and Zach I hope you see this because you truly did such an amazing job and gave us lasting memories that we will always cherish and hold dear to our hearts. You two are family. And to top things off the owner of Complete weddings stopped by to check in on us and congratulate us. Truly such amazing services and amazing people. Please book these guys.

We used A Plus Entertainment for our wedding and had such a great experience. Their online planner/questionnaire made the whole process really easy—it covers all the details, and then they go over everything with you on the phone to make sure it’s exactly what you want. Their communication was excellent throughout, and they were flexible with the last-minute changes we needed to make, which we really appreciated. The DJ they sent out for our wedding was awesome and kept the energy perfect all night. We were so happy with how everything turned out. Highly recommend A Plus Entertainment!

Amore DJ Entertainment was one of the best decisions we ever made for our wedding! My husband was very particular about what our wedding music would entail, as he didn't want the, "average/cliche wedding music." Matt, the owner of Amore, was so detailed every step of the way, even including a personalized book that allowed us to pick, in detail, the music we wanted. He gave us tips, and advice, and was also just a kind person. I think a DJ can make or break a wedding as they hold the responsibility for the timeline (especially at the reception), and also hold the energy in the room when the dance floor opens. Matt did just that. Our whole reception was full of dancing, laughter, and just high energy! Our ceremony went smoothly (other than my brother missing his que to stop playing the piano lol). I highly highly recommend Amore DJ Entertainment if you are wanting an incredible DJ experience on one of the most important days of your life. Matt looks at it as that too - YOUR important day. He even snapped a few reception photos and sent them to us on a hard drive, with a Christmas ornament for our first Christmas married (we were married in May). No detail is lost, and I am thankful we went with Amore.
