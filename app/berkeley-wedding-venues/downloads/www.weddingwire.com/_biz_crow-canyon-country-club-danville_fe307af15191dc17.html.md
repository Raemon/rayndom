Simply the best! 100% Recommend.

We hosted our pre wedding celebration at Crow Canyon and we couldn't be happier. The location is so beautiful with such picturesque views and every guest that walked in was awestruck by its beauty. The have several in house elements like speakers, table flowers, linen options , easel, chaffing dishes that are part of the package. We catered food from a vendor because we wanted more Indian dishes, although their drinks was a big hit. We served cocktails and mocktails and everyone seemed to love it. Now coming to the staff - They're the best. We were introduced to Miranda - The Event Director and she's a blessing. She took care of EVERY little detail and made sure our big day was truly special. She is kind, patient, thoughtful and made our vision come true. A true champ! Also, special thanks to all the waiting staff, their Manager, the receptionist - they're such wonderful people and a joy to work with. We are truly pleased with how everything turned out. Thank you team Crow Canyon. We cannot wait to host more events in future!

Absolutely amazing! 

The Crow Canyon Country Club was absolutely amazing!! They worked with my budget and I couldn’t have asked for a better wedding event coordinator. Kymberlie and Chelsea are the best! They were prompt to respond and answer/address any questions/concerns we had, and were so professional and down to earth. The food was to die for, my guests are still talking about how good it was. We are so happy with how everything turned out! We also worked with Ariel. He made our vision come to life and made sure the food, drinks and decor was how it should be. The staff really helped make our wedding dreams become a reality. Couldn’t have chosen a better venue for our special day.

Our wedding day at the Crow Canyon Country Club went off without a hitch and we thank the helpfulness, flexibility and "wedding ingenuity" of the facilities and event coordinator (Tiffany Child) for that. From planning our day through the ceremony itself, CCCC helped in everyway possible.

Couldn't have asked for a better venue for my reception. Tiffany Childs, who is the director of private events, is absolutely wonderful to work with. They made sure that everything was taken care of. I have absolutely no complaints. They were very helpful in the days leading up to the event and the day of was absolutely perfect. I wouldn't have changed one thing about it!

Crow Canyon was definitely a great reception choice. They were very accomodating and willing to meet to discuss layout and day-of options. The staff is very friendly and my guests were treated very well. There were a few logistics that did not go as planned the night of, otherwise I would have been able to give a perfect score. Crow Canyon was a very classy location.
