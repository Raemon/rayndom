A Christmas Eve Wedding!

Bradley and I got married on Christmas Eve at the Glasbern Inn! The venue was the perfect fit for our cozy Christmas wedding. I stayed in their Garden Cottage the day before the wedding. It has beautiful stone fireplaces, which was perfect for relaxing and getting ready. Our coordinator, Megan, was very detail-oriented and accommodating. She made the wedding such an easy process for us. The staff was attentive and extremely helpful the day of our wedding. They put together our dream wedding with every detail that we envisioned. We are extremely happy we chose the Glasbern Inn as our venue.

Better Than We Imagined

The bottom line is that I don’t think we could’ve chosen a better venue for our wedding. We visited for a tour in March of 2022 and fell in love, despite not being able to see it during the fall. It had everything we wanted: beautiful grounds, convenient accommodation, amazing food, and the versatility to tailor it all to what we wanted for ourselves and our guests.  
  
We’d already loved what we were getting with Glasbern, but I think we were most surprised and impressed with the attention and care we received throughout our stay. We were lucky enough to be able to spend 2 days before the wedding and really experience the place without the whirlwind of planned wedding activities. The Garden Cottage was even better than we’d hoped – it was private, beautiful and so comfortable. We treated ourselves to a couples massage at the spa, which was a great move with how quickly the pace quickened afterwards. We hosted our rehearsal dinner in the Grainery, and the food, drinks, and atmosphere were perfect.  
  
Megan had been our point-of-contact for months, and I can’t thank her enough for her seemingly unending patience for my many MANY emails and questions. Hazel was our event manager starting with the rehearsal, and she was on top of everything. Even a day before the wedding, there were things we hadn’t considered, and she handled them all! We went over our mountain of bins and decoration and favors, and she was able to turn my vague direction into something magical. On the day of the wedding, I met Morgan who was everywhere I needed her to be ALL DAY. She had an uncanny knack for popping up out of nowhere, often immediately before I needed her. I had spent 1.5 years worrying about every little thing, and all that anxiety melted away, thanks to these ladies!  
  
All the staff we encountered were wonderful and so friendly. It really felt like everyone just wanted us to have a worry-free great time, and I think we all did. I’ve heard nothing but praise from our family and friends.  
  
For the weeks leading up to our wedding day, the weather forecast showed rain for our wedding day. During the 2 days we stayed beforehand, the weather was gorgeous, so we walked the grounds to soak in how beautiful it was, knowing we weren’t going to be so lucky for our special day. On the morning of the wedding, Morgan stopped by with white umbrellas (another really lovely touch by Glasbern). While I’m sure we still would’ve had amazing photo opportunities in rain, we didn’t have to find out because everything cleared up right before we were ready for photos. Everywhere you looked was just beautiful. We haven’t received our photos from the photographer yet, but I can’t wait to see them.  
  
I am certain that I’m forgetting details and personal touches because there were so many, but we were both so impressed with how smoothly things went and how beautiful everything was. No wedding is going to be cheap, but we felt like our money was well spent for how perfect everything was. Thank you Glasbern!

Amazing Wedding Venue- June 2022

My husband and I had our wedding here in June, and everything was perfect! Kelsey, Morgan, and the whole Glasbern staff were so friendly and helpful, and the food was absolutely delicious!! Our guests are still raving about how gorgeous the venue, rooms, and how great the food was, and our vendors appreciated how kind and welcoming the Glasbern staff was. It was truly a fairytale wedding with the perfect indoor and outdoor setup!

Wonderful experience!

Glasbern saved my wedding! My original venue cancelled on us 2 weeks prior to our wedding. My makeup artist recommended that I reach out to Amber at Glasbern. Amber jumped in and saved the day. I was so grateful that I was able to have my micro wedding at a beautiful location, and Amber made sure my day ran smoothly. She literally took care of all the details for me. In the end, I am so happy that things worked out the way they did, and I could not have been happier with my experience and how accommodating and helpful Amber and Glasbern was!

Wedding - January 2021 

We cannot say enough great things about Glasbern's location, ambience and the staff! We changed venues two weeks prior to our event in January 2021, and Glasbern's staff made this process seamless.   
We would not have been able to pull this event off with such detail in our time constraints if it were not for the help of Joanna, Director of Events. Joanna was able to answer every question that we had and was always one step ahead of us to make sure we had everything accounted for and that no detail was missed. She made the day the most memorable, and we would recommend the Glasbern to any couple that is looking for a venue.   
If you are looking for a rustic venue that has character, look no further. The food is amazing, breakfast is included the next day, and we would give the Glasbern more than five stars, if possible!

Hidden Jewel

After rescheduling our daughter’s April 25, 2020 wedding date and dealing with so many disappointments, the big day finally happened on Friday, July 31. The Glasbern is a hidden jewel not only for the breathtaking grounds, but for the fabulous food, first-class hospitality, top-notch staff, and beautiful accommodations. Our celebration started with the rehearsal dinner in the Glasloft with a great menu and our terrific server, Courtney. The ceremony and reception could not have been more perfect with every staff member tending to the needs of our guests. The wonderfully delicious cuisine again was executed by Chef Patrick and assistants, Thomas, and Sean. A big shout out to the awesome servers Mayson, Sariyah, Sophia, and Courtney and to the friendly and accommodating bartenders, Chris and Russ.  
  
A very, very special thanks to Amber and Brandy. These two were hands on every step of the way; extremely responsive whether by phone, email, or text and both were easily accessible from the moment we stepped on the grounds to the moment we left. Everything was perfectly orchestrated, every detail meticulously tended to. Each member of the staff, from groundskeeper to innkeeper, is well versed in hospitality. We never heard anyone say “no, we can’t do that”. We were so happy our daughter and son-in-law chose this beautiful place and would strongly encourage everyone to consider the Glasbern for their special day or any special event. It was such a remarkable experience.

Amazing venue

We just held our October wedding at the Glasbern Inn, and EVERYONE complimented us on the venue. Everything was perfect, from the setting to the food. In fact, the food was highly regarded as "some of the best food ever at a wedding." Many family members stayed at the Inn, and they were great at making sure we had a room block set up and making the process transparent. There was also a complimentary sit down breakfast included with the rooms, which was a very nice touch.   
  
The staff really went above and beyond to make everything perfect. Amanda, the event coordinator, was great! We really enjoyed working with her. We had an amazing time, and we can't wait to come back and enjoy a romantic weekend in the future!

I'm getting married on October 15, 2016. I live in NJ and everything is MAD expensive in my state (especially when you want an October wedding on a Saturday evening), so it was wonderful to find everything I was looking for at a much more reasonable price just by crossing a bit over the PA border. This place is so unbelievable lovely! I've been working with Kathleen, and she's been nothing short of fantastic. She's incredibly responsive and helpful, plus she gives great advice (she's also been very patient even when dealing with my crazy parents). Definitely check this place out whether you're looking for something intimate or huge, or if you're just passing through the area and need a charming place to stay.

My wedding on July 1, 2015 was beautiful. The staff was just wonderful, especially Erica. She was just amazing, she was there the whole time making sure everything went perfect. When things got off track (nothing that was caused or due to the Glasbern) she sprung in to action and straightened it out. We can't thank her enough! The food was great , not like typical wedding food at all. The service was quick and responsive to my guests needs. Our wedding was great ! We are so glad we choose the Glasbern.

I have been working with the beautiful Glasbern Inn located in Fogelsville, PA for the last several years! The venue is so gorgeous and the setting is serene and perfect for any size of wedding. The staff is exceptionally accommodating and pleasant! The food is amazing and the intimate setting is so romantic. It's location although close to the comforts of city life but is tucked away in its own little piece of heaven. I would definitely recommend Glasbern to anyone!

The Glasbern Inn is a wonderful venue for a wedding or just about any special event. I'm always excited to be providing music for events at the Glasbern! Besides working there professionally from time to time, it is also one of my wife's favorite spots for dining - so we go there whenever the opportunity arises. The food is out of this world!
