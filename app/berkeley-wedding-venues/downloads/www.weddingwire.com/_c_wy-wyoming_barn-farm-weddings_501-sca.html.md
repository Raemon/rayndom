The Canary Barn is super unique & historical. I love when you drive up that you are immediately met with that awesome gate. Then you see that distinct white and green barn. It’s amazing that it has such a long history in the Platte Valley. The idea that something that has been apart of Platte Valley for so long is being restored to tell more stories is amazing. The craftsmanship and attention to detail are really special when you walk into that barn. I highly recommend this venue to tell your unique wedding story. It would also be amazing to host parties & get togethers. It really is a special place!

This place is extremely picturesque and relaxing. We did a weekend buyout and I would highly recommend doing the same! All of our guests came from far and wide and spent a weekend not worrying about anything but which activities to plan for the next day. It was the BEST weekend of our lives, easily said.

Our wedding ceremony was held on Aug 9 at Barn Anew. It is an absolutely beautiful location for an outdoor wedding. Cher was great to work with as well. My only suggestion is to provide a larger room for the bridal party to get ready in.

The Wyoming Hereford Ranch is like stepping back in time! The whole ranch is beautiful and provided the perfect backdrop for our wedding. My husband was being deployed and we decided to get married before he left. They were so kind and were able to fit us in on short notice. We opted for the Sale Barn and after decorating the tables and putting up lights, we created a truly magical experience. We were married by the creek underneath a huge tree, and then proceeded to the barn for our reception. If you are looking for an authentic western experience, beautiful scenery and good people, this is the place!

Leah was great to work with the entire time! We were able to have all of our bridal party stay in the cabins right at the venue and have the beautiful Wind River Mountain Range in our pictures. Guests continually told us what a beautiful venue we picked. Plus the barn made the ideal spot for our reception. I'd definitely recommend this venue to anyone looking for a great rustic wedding location.

This is a family owned and operated business (full disclaimer, my family runs it - but I figured I'd share why I think it's special). There are beautiful views of the Grand Teton Mountains (so your photos will be incredible). We work with all the best local catering companies (so you can get any type of food and meet any budget). Because we are family owned and operated, we care very much about our reputation and making sure you have an incredible experience (i.e. you're not going to be dealing with seasonal employees that aren't around when you're wedding day comes - you're going to be dealing with our family, and we've been in Jackson since 1912). Finally, we have a beautiful herd of horses that just love being in photos (so if you like horses, you're going to love getting married here). And if you don't like horses, that's OK - the horses don't have to be in photos - they're happy grazing in the open fields and meadows in the evenings as the sun sets over the Grand Teton mountains. Got questions, please email us and it will be our pleasure to respond! - The Diamond Cross family team
