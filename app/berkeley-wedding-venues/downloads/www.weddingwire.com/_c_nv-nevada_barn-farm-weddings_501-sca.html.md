The whole experience was great! Iris was responsive, anticipated challenges and was available to assist. The grounds come alive in the evening with fire features and the beauty of the Truckee, the added sculpture garden is a total bonus. CJ with Bubbles & Brews was the best for a mobile bar service

We were looking for a venue that was beautiful, affordable, and is going to be us. My fiancé and I went and visited this venue today and were astonished by how beautiful and how nice the people are. The venue had something for everyone and we can make it ours. We are planning to book this beautiful place for 2027 and are over the moon!!!

Park Home Ranch is the most beautiful barn venue. We had my daughter’s wedding here in late October. The weather held out, and we had the most beautiful day. The barn itself is just so beautiful. Patricia was so attentive from start to finish, and helped my daughter’s wedding be everything she dreamed of.

My husband and I had our wedding here last July, and it is still one of the best days of our lives not only because of how special it was but because of how beautiful Kirkwood and the staff was. If you’re looking to fulfill your dreams of getting married outside and feeling luxurious yet outdoorsy - this is the place. At the food tasting we were able to choose exactly what food we wanted at the wedding and it was delicious, I highly recommend doing this. You get to meet the chef and is overall such a fun time. Our coordinator was amazing! She kept us on time and made me feel super special as a bride. Thank you again for everything!

From the moment we toured Olympic Valley Stables, it just felt right. The setting, the openness, and the mountain backdrop immediately stood out, and we both knew this was where we wanted to get married. It is an incredibly beautiful venue and truly the perfect location for an outdoor mountain wedding. It had everything we were looking for in a venue and more. On the wedding day, the space was even more stunning than we remembered. Our guests could not stop talking about the views and how special the setting felt. There is something really calming and grounding about being surrounded by the mountains, and it made the entire day feel meaningful and unforgettable. One of the things we loved most about Olympic Valley Stables is how versatile the space is. It feels like a blank canvas in the best way, allowing you to make the day completely your own. Mich and Sarah were kind, welcoming, and patient. We were able to bring our vision to life while still letting the natural beauty of the venue shine through. We are so grateful we were able to get married here and cannot imagine a better place to have celebrated our wedding.

From the moment we booked, Penelope was incredibly responsive, answered all our questions promptly, and made the entire booking process smooth, stress-free. The venue itself is simply breathtaking. In the heart of Bridgeport Valley with panoramic views of the Eastern Sierras, it offers a backdrop that is nothing short of magical. It felt like stepping into a dream every time we looked out across the meadows at sunset during our wedding night! Guests can even camp or bring RVs on site, which was such a fun, communal touch that added to the weekend feel—many of our loved ones stayed right there under the stars. On our wedding weekend, everything fell into place beautifully. The venue was clean, and Benny (The Owner) was helpful with the whole weekend. Another perk of this venue is the fact that you get it for the entire weekend 48 hours from Friday to Sunday, which was great to hold a rehearsal dinner too! All in all, the Bridgeport Ranch exceed every expectation. If you’re looking for a rustic yet stunning location with incredible views, full control over your vendors and decorations. We’ll treasure these memories forever and can’t recommend this venue enough!

Smith Farm was by far the BEST venue we could have asked for! Some of the reasons you should choose this venue... -the communication was quick, professional and welcoming -the bridal and groom suites were adorable and easily accessible -there's a saloon in the barn -Donna has everything you need (for those "oops I forgot xyz moments" \- Smith Farm has worked with numerous venues and has the BEST advice -the truck in the photos... we got to use that for a prop and before walking down the aisle! Donna was amazing to work with from the initial visit to the ending of the reception. I cannot recommend this venue enough!
