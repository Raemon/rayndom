Greg was the DJ at my sister's wedding. His music selections for the evening were perfect, and my sister highly recommended him for his flexibility on requests, and his general demeanor. We immediately reach out to Greg for our own wedding. We were able to communicate with him up to the day before the wedding with song request/changes, and he was super amenable to incorporate them with no grief. I also asked Greg to coordinate with a different vendor to synchronize music both indoor and outdoors for a fireworks display, and he gladly spoke to the vendor on my behalf and got his system integrated with theirs for a seamless musical experience. Greg's information collecting process is super detailed, and we at no point felt that we needed to worry or stress about if the correct song would be played at the exact correct moment. I cannot recommend Greg Frasier enough.

From the first conversation to the final song of the night, everything was professional, seamless, and stress-free. Dave truly understands how to read a room, the energy never dropped once.

Mark and Denise were the DJs at our wedding. We can’t say enough good things - responsive, fun and great advisors. From the first conversation we felt comfortable with both of them. They captured all the ideas we had for ceremony and cocktail hour music. The reception was rocking. We had people saying they never danced this much at a wedding! They had people up dancing all night. We do recommend them to DJ your event.

Tommy's Tunes did the DJ service for our wedding, and they were absolutely incredible! They truly made the night so much fun. The music selection was perfect, and they knew exactly how to read the room—the dance floor was packed all night long, just as we hoped. Besides the fantastic music and energy, we were also thrilled with the great photos they captured throughout the event. It was a seamless experience from start to finish. Highly recommend them for any event if you want a guaranteed good time!

We couldn’t have asked for a better DJ team for our wedding! From start to finish, they were absolutely fantastic. Levi, our MC, made seamless and energetic introductions that set the perfect tone, and Josh (DJ Tracktion) kept the dance floor alive all night with incredible music choices. The week before, we went over the type of music and vibe we wanted, and they completely nailed it. The ceremony music was also executed flawlessly. We’ve had multiple guests tell us it was the best DJ they’ve ever experienced at a wedding. They were also very responsive and easy to plan with leading up to the wedding. Can’t recommend DJE more highly!

We used Magical Memories as our DJ and MC for our wedding, and everything went perfectly! They were very reasonable, worked within our budget, and made the entire process easy and stress-free. The team at Magical Memories was incredibly responsive and really took the time to listen to our needs and preferences. We highly recommend them to any couple planning their big day!

Booking Showcase Sound was the easiest part of wedding planning, and everything was fantastic. My now husband doesn't dance, but he danced the entire night away with me because he said the songs were too good not to. We personally had Elijah and my one request was for guests to say that their feet hurt after the wedding. Well I couldn't feel my legs after the night was done, so mission accomplished! Elijah put on a 4 hour set where everyone was dancing the entire time. The only thing that pulled me off the dance floor was the wedding coordinator saying it was time to cut the cake! Showcase sound went above and beyond our expectations making the day spectacular!

Music makes or breaks a wedding, and Bravura was the perfect DJ for ours!!! We got married at Water's Edge and were so lucky that Bravura is the recommended DJ there. It was important for us to choose a DJ that knew the venue well. They have so many options to customize your perfect dance floor, and Tony was so helpful in assisting us with those choices. We also had a live violinist for our ceremony which was the perfect touch (and they were able to play the songs we requested!) Meeting Tony in-person solidified our choice. Not only did he pump us up for the big day, but he also eased our worries about the flow of the event and assured us that we were in great hands. And we absolutely were! We felt confident with Tony as our MC. From the introductions to the special dances to music selections, everything was perfect. We had an absolute blast, and so did all of our guests. We can't thank Tony and the Bravura team enough for giving us a night we'll never forget.

Barb Fox was absolutely incredible! We had a themed wedding, and she was so helpful in the creative process—truly helping bring our vision to life. She took the time to understand what we wanted and made sure the entire night flowed seamlessly. The timeline was spot-on, the music was perfect, and the dance floor stayed full from start to finish. Guests were dancing right up until the last song, and we’ve heard nothing but amazing feedback from our guests since. We couldn’t have asked for a better DJ!

Carol was incredible to work with from start to finish. My wife and I are super busy with work and being able to meet virtually was a blessing. Her advice on the flow of the wedding reception, the songs to play, and her ability to pickup on our likes and dislikes translated perfectly to the reception. The dancefloor was packed all night, literally as I would think "she should play this song", bam it would start playing. Having Carol as part of our wedding team was the perfect choice and she really made the reception the epic party that it was!
