Whether you're dreaming of saying 'I do' surrounded by the rolling hills of the sun-kissed Tuscan countryside or you're envisioning breathtaking views of the Amalfi Coast for your wedding day, there's no mistaking that Italy is filled with scenic wedding locations that will have you pinching yourself. From centuries-old villas and castles to luxury hotels and oceanfront resorts, there are so many different [Italy wedding venues](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/it-italy/italy/wedding-venues/IT-11-rca.html) at your fingertips—the tough part is choosing just one! We've hand-picked an assortment of well-known and under-the-radar Italian wedding venues to kickstart your search for the perfect setting to begin  _la dolce vita._

## Getting Married in Italy

Before you can bring your dream [Italian wedding](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/italian-themed-wedding-ideas) to life, there's a handful of paperwork you'll need to prepare (and bring with you) in order for your wedding to comply with local laws. The exact rules will vary by region and municipality, and whether or not you're choosing to have only a symbolic ceremony, but generally, you and your partner will need to provide passports, birth certificates, and documents of intention, which will prove that there are no legal obstacles that could stop your marriage from taking place. Any documents in English will likely need to be translated to Italian and authorized by a court official in the town where you're getting married. Most Italy wedding venues have a team of professionals who can advise you on the exact process, but it can also be helpful to hire an [Italian wedding planner](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/it-italy/italy/wedding-planners/IT-15-rca.html) who has experience with destination weddings and assisting couples from other countries.

## Castello del Trebbio

### Florence, Tuscany

Tucked away in the Tuscan countryside, Castello del Trebbio is the perfect balance of rustic and luxury. This private villa, which dates back to the 12th century (yes, really!), is just 15 minutes from Florence but feels serene and secluded, thanks to the hillsides, vineyards, and cypress trees that surround the property.

The Amalfi Coast gets a lot of attention for being Italy's most beautiful stretch of beaches, but the Adriatic coastline, on the opposite shore, is just as scenic.

There, you'll find smaller port towns, fewer crowds, and hidden gem wedding venues, including Villa Carafa in Trani. With several grand ballrooms and Italian gardens on the property, you'll have a range of options when it comes to choosing a backdrop that matches your wedding day vision. From there, the venue's in-house team of event planners and chefs will help you coordinate all of the details, including decor, menus, entertainment, and other ways to impress your guests.
