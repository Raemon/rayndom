What a wonderful ceremony we had thanks to Solange. She made our dreams come true. We feel so grateful to have met her and prepared our wedding with her. She totally understood who we are and what we want, and led the ceremony with magnificence and emotions. Don't hesitate and go ahead with her, you'll live the most beautiful and personal ceremony ever. Thank you so much Solange!

Florence with Celebrance Versailles France, was absolutely amazing. She exceeded our expectations for our 25 year wedding renewal that was held on the Tower Eiffel, Paris.We had an instant connection with her, she is very caring and sincere. The ceremony she wrote & officiated was simply beautiful. I cannot say enough about her and her professionalism. We would highly recommend her, hands-down.

It has been almost 3 months since our Paris elopement, and we are still on a high from the experience. Laura created such a personalized experience for us, curating our schedule and every detail meticulously so that we could just savor the magic of our day. Everything was planned perfectly, and she and her team exceeded our expectations in every way. Living in the US and unfamiliar with Paris, Laura really took time to listen to us and understand our tastes and preferences. She put us at ease, removing uncertainty and relieving all of our stress, while sharing recommendations on where to stay, offering ceremony and photo locations, scheduling options and coordinating transportation. All we had to do was wake up and enjoy the ride. She was delightful to work with throughout and orchestrated a beautiful experience and ceremony full of personal touches that only someone who truly knows us would’ve been able to include. By mixing romantic French passages with English in officiating, she made for an authentically Paris experience which we loved. Everything was perfect: From the moment the stylist arrived at our hotel in the morning, to the friendly hotel greetings as we embarked, amazing transportation provided by a warm chauffeur who shared personal insights to Paris life and history while we travelled around the city, to the beautiful waterfront ceremony under the eye of the Eiffel Tower, to the way the photo/video team treated us like celebrities, capturing the day with us around Paris like a well knowledge entourage navigating the best lighting and finding iconic spots to photograph us at the Louvre, the bridge, and other amazing spots, shooting with angles only a local expert would employ. Everything was like a perfect dream, and as we departed from Laura at the end of the day, it was like waving to an old friend. She treated us so well, personalized every moment to our preferences, and officiated our ceremony with such bright energy and romantic language. The beauty of the day and Paris has imprinted our hearts, and we are still reeling from the magic of the experience.

Michelle did a fantastic job with our ceremony in France. Finding an officiant overseas is difficult, but we felt like Michelle was the right choice for us the minute we met her. She did a beautiful job incorporating our love story into the ceremony and it was such a joyful and personal day.

What a blessing to have Eric as the officiant at my daughter and future son-in-law's wedding! Eric is such a warm friendly person one immediately feels like he is a friend. He is so communicative and professional and totally dedicated to making the bridal couple's most important day absolutely perfect. He puts in so much time and effort into ensuring that the ceremony reflects their personalities perfectly, and includes all their likes and preferences. Eric reached out to me as the mother of the bride asking for interesting insights and details of my daughter's life and what was important to her It was a pleasure communicating with him. Eric integrated what I told him into the ceremony in such a warm, delightful and fun way it warmed our hearts. He did this for the groom as well. Eric is so passionate about what he does, is completely committed, and he puts his heart and soul into being the most amazing officiant that he is, and this reflects in the beautiful, meaningful and personalised ceremony that is the result of his dedication and caring. The ceremony was absolutely perfect in every way, we could not have wished for more. We were so touched and delighted, as were our family and guests. What an honor and privilege to have Eric officiate for us. The amazing wedding ceremony is indelibly etched in memory. I highly recommend Eric to be your officiant of choice to ensure a wedding ceremony that far exceeds your expectations - what an amazing man he is!
