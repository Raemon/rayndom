We had the perfect wedding thanks to Tama and her Sweet Retreat! Tama met with us months in advance to walk through our plans and help bring our vision to life. She was so flexible, even when we needed to add an extra night to our reservation a month before the wedding. And on the wedding weekend, she was right there, managing the delivery of our tables and chairs (which she also supplies upon request!), helping our coordinator set up decorations, and even supplying extra decor and tableware (when we were inevitably missing a few things). Through it all, she was cheerful, kind, and incredibly supportive. We can't recommend this venue enough! If you're looking for the perfect outdoor wedding in West Virginia (I mean, c'mon, look at these shots), you won't find better quality or value than Sweet Retreat!

Lilian was amazing and the venue itself is so beautiful. They made the day so effortless and everyone was great to work with. We rented the arch, flat ware, napkins, and used 1010 for catering. Everything was beautiful and tasted great.

I could easily have spent a week relaxing in the cabin or a week exploring the beautiful, unique trails and overlooks. Thanks for such a wonderful stay.

This was the perfect site for our somewhat non-traditional wedding. Kim, the camp director, was great to work with -- she was very flexible about allowing us to visit when we needed to do so. She was a huge help with logistics, making recommendations regarding catering, room set-up, etc. It was a great value for a very reasonable charge.

We were married at Valley View in early September. The weather was perfect and the ceremony setting was so beautiful!! We decorated the barn with quilts, antlers, and mason jars for our country wedding. They gave us access to the venue several days in advance which made things so much easier when the big day arrived. We had so many compliments on the location and everyone was very impressed with the fancy restrooms. All of our guests loved the place and the pictures turned out amazing!!!
