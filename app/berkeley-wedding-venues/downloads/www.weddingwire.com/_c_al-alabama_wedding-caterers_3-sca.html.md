When looking for a caterer, we were told by multiple people that if you are a foodie, this was the place you booked with. That statement is 100% accurate. Everything Savoie served at our wedding was super delicious. They worked to create a nice, cozy fall menu for us that felt special without being overdone. They were also super accommodating in preparing a special, separate meal for one guest who had severe allergies to gluten and soy. Nico are her team were on top of it all during the reception and made sure all of our vendors were fed as well (one vendor forgot to mention they needed to be fed and the staff quickly fixed a plate for them). We went home with tons of leftovers which fed us for an additional week after, haha! They also did a great job bartending for our guests. Would highly recommend them for ANY event that needs catering. They are on the pricier side but we found it was definitely worth the money!!!

They are wonderful to work with and very helpful, this was especially appreciated due to covid rescheduling. The owner and her staff did a wonderful job decorating the venue and the flowers it was exactly what my daughter wanted. The food was delicious especially the cake. They setup, served and cleaned. I would highly recommend for any event.

We had Chef on Call cater both our rehearsal dinner and our wedding reception, and they did an excellent job! Ina was responsive and flexible working with us as we planned our wedding from out of state. She helped us create a menu that we loved and all the food was delicious!

Bruce is amazing. I cannot thank him enough for everything. He did all our florals, catering and the cake (and brownies!!) He went above and beyond making my dreams come true. The food was the #1 thing our guests raved about all night long. I am still drooling thinking about it all. If you are looking for high-quality food that will WOW..go with Belle Fleur. He also makes the most amazing melt in your mouth cakes. I swear so matter how many bites I took of our cake I never got sick of the flavor. If you are looking for a vendor who has a genuine soul and an intense eye for detail than you need to go with Bruce at Belle Fleur...you will not regret it at all!!

These are the most down-to earth people you'll ever meet. They make sure that everything is suited to your tastes AND your budget. The food was phenomenal. Fresh, seasonal, and super-hot. The wait-staff was fast and very stealthy. People are still raving about how amazing it looked and tasted.. The arrangements were so well displayed that the photographer even got pictures of it. -BIG bang for the buck- Parrish will see to your every need- the whole team was born and raised here, and they know every venue in town. Very well done, and very WORTH IT.

Kathy G catered my daughter’s wedding and we were thrilled with the food! It was important to the bride and groom that the food really be a focal point, as it was a daytime wedding. We are still hearing from guests about the fried oysters and the lemonade! Natalie was so helpful and really worked with us to make our menu custom to our event! Highly recommend!
