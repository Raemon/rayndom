Our reception at the St. Louis Art Museum was absolutely stunning and we are so happy we chose this place.

Getting married at the Downtown library was the best decision my husband and I made! The church we belong to was too small for the crowd we wanted, so we needed another option. The newly renovating building is beautiful inside and out and is full of rich history. We were supposed to have the ceremony in Kirk Hall and the reception in another room that had a rooftop terrace. Unfortunately, it was rainy and cold that day, so we had to move the reception indoors at the last minute. The staff was extremely flexible with our decision! The turnover from the ceremony to the reception was extremely fast and all of our guests say it was one of the most beautiful weddings they have EVER been too. Thank you to Todd and his wonderful staff!

The CAM event staff was amazing to work with. They did literally everything. My guests, family, nor myself had to do anything! They moved all of the chairs and tables in a matter of minutes and had everything ready to go. They gave us a lot of creative freedom with the space and it was truly the best value out of all of the venues we looked at in St. Louis. Carmen, our event coordinator was a pleasure to work with.

This location offers excellent options. There is an outdoor gazebo under the trees and a lovely large building with an elegant large antique bar. The people are wonderful to work with, and the cost of this venue is more affordable than several we looked at. We reserved the area for 11 hours total. Would recommend Shawnee Town in a minute!

The Foundry Art Centre was a beautiful venue for our wedding. We loved the large size of the space for our large wedding and the flexibility to choose our own caterer. Also, as noted in other reviews, the Foundry Art Centre is extremely flexible with letting you execute your vision. We wanted to do ice cream as a dessert and they didn't have a freezer, so they allowed us to bring our own small freezer and plug it in their kitchen to keep our ice cream frozen. Also, Paige, the event coordinator, is super wonderful to work with and very organized and responsive. She responded very quickly to any random question we had and was very open to meeting with us anytime we wanted to come visit the space. This alleviated a lot of stress throughout the process. Would definitely recommend the Foundry Art Centre if you are looking for a large, beautiful, unique venue with the flexibility to make it your own.

We had our ceremony and reception at Mad Art at the end of June. Taylor, the event coordinator, was so helpful and prompt through the whole planning process, and the day of the wedding she was on top of everything! She made sure that everything was taken care of (even things we hadn't thought about). We felt completely at ease about the logistics of everything thanks to Taylor and the other staff. When the DJ and officiant arrived Taylor had a little chat with them and got on the same page about everything which really helped the evening flow smoothly. The only thing we had to worry about was getting ourselves ready! They have a really nice "green room" for the bridal party (or whoever else) to get ready in. Originally, we had planned to have our ceremony outside, but because of extremely hot temps and rain we decided the day before to move the ceremony inside and it went beautifully. The gallery space where the ceremony & reception were held was spacious, cool even with the hot, muggy weather outside, and plenty big for our 95 guests. We went very simple on the table decor because the space is already so nice with the lighting and art on the walls. The food was delicious and definitely not typical boring "wedding food". We chose the smoked turkey and brisket as the protein choices, and Ron the owner/chef added burnt ends at the last minute and they were awesome! Our friends and family loved the food, the space, and the old cell blocks. The bar staff was very quick and friendly. The outdoor courtyard made for beautiful pictures. Mad Art is a unique, all in one venue with a helpful staff that takes care of everything so you can enjoy your wedding celebration without worry.

This was the most amazing and beautiful place to have a wedding the way you want it. The scenery is gorgeous, the staff is very flexible, and helpful. If there is anything you need done in a timely manner though, ask early and often to make sure you stay on the same page and that it gets done. I would definitely recommend this venue!

We knew we wanted to get married at the zoo, as both of us are animal lovers. There are 4-5 different venues to pick from. We chose the McDonnell River Camp for our wedding. We were married on the beautiful patio with a waterfall and entered the River Camp for a beautiful indoor reception. The kitchen was accommodating to our guests' dietary restrictions (gluten free, nut free, etc) and the staff was attentive to our guests' needs. The bar staff rocked it and we never noticed a wait for our patrons. We were so pleased with our decision to use the Saint Louis Zoo. I wouldn't change anything!

My husband and I got married here a few weeks ago and it was absolute perfection. The team (Jessi, Jessica and Victoria) were so helpful as we don’t live in the area. We had a lot of expectations and specifications of how we wanted the wedding to look, flow, be set up, and much more. They met every expectation and request. We did our cocktail hour in the Kiel Club and reception in the Grand Hall/Lobby. You were able to have as many signatures as we wanted. The food portions were massive and flavorful. They worked with our third-party dessert vendor to distribute the dessert to the guest as they were seated. Our guests were amazed by how beautiful the spaces were and how good the food was. We also requested for additional bartenders so guest did not have to wait a second for a drink. Team again was amazing and so helpful.
