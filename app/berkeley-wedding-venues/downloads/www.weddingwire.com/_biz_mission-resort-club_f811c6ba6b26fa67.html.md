Wedding of Our Dreams

When we went wedding venue searching, Mission Inn was our last stop and we truly saved the best for last. As soon as we arrived we were greeted and felt an instant connection with the wedding coordinator and the resort itself is gorgeous! When planning your wedding with them you never have to worry about them forgetting about you or your vendors. They communicate with you so effectively you don't feel lost in the planning process and when you do feel lost, your assigned coordinator will help with whatever you need. We had a big wedding of 220 guests and enjoyed all the amenities the resort offered. All our guests said they had the best time and I truly couldn't imagine our wedding being anywhere else. I highly recommend Mission Inn for your weddings or any of your big party events!

Mission Inn Resort Maritza and David

Mission Inn Resort is a beautiful venue for a wedding. The wedding sales manager we worked with was great. All the staff before and during the wedding were awesome. It all went off great. Everything was setup and ready on time. We very much appreciated all the staff at Mission Inn that helped make out day special.

Wedding Venue

This was just the most perfect place for my husband and I to have our wedding. We loved every moment of the experience. The team here was so nice and accommodating, we couldn’t have asked for a better venue. We were married in the Legends Courtyard… an absolute breathtaking place for a wedding.

Gorgeous location, wonderful staff, perfect wedding day!

My husband and I had our November wedding at Mission Inn, and we could not be happier with our entire experience. Our coordinator, Paige, was beyond incredible to work with and made our day run unbelievably smooth. Every single staff member we interacted with was kind, friendly, and helpful. Absolutely stunning!

Unforgettable experience!

I cannot rave enough about how great Mission Inn was for our wedding! The resort style stay made it extremely easy for family to get together and spend time with each other all weekend instead of booking separate hotels. The weather was perfect and the golf lovers in our group loved playing the courses before the wedding! We even had a huge scramble with the guests. Paige was extremely responsive and helped us out for months leading up to the wedding. We could not have done it without her. We had multiple events on site including a welcome party, reception, ceremony, and after party! Shuttles were provided and transportation was easy. The guests would not stop talking about how beautiful the venue was. If you’re looking for the ‘old Florida’ feel, the Mission Inn is perfect! Highly recommended, we did not have a single issue on wedding day! Thanks Mission Inn team and Paige for an unforgettable weekend!

Mission Inn Weddings

We chose Mission Inn as our wedding venue, and we are so happy that we did! We were originally looking at another venue nearby, and then my now husband mentioned the Mission Inn, just right across the street. He used to golf there with his grandfather when he was younger. We decided to take a tour, after struggling with finding a venue. We met Jessica, and we fell in love! She showed us the multiple venues that are available for weddings, and we chose the Legends Courtyard. A secluded, quiet, gorgeous spot overlooking the golf course. Not only did we find the perfect wedding venue, we found the best wedding planning team! The all-inclusive package made wedding planning so smooth, and made our decisions much easier. Paige was our event manager, and she made sure we were happy with all aspects of our special day. She was very responsive, organized, and so kind to us. She’s got a busy job, but she made us feel like we were her only couple. And on the day of, she checked in on us throughout the day, and all through the night to make sure we were satisfied. Our wedding day was the best day of our lives, and we will forever be thankful to Mission Inn for being such an integral part of that.

Misson Inn Resort Wedding Team 

Mission Inn was the perfect location for our wedding day! From the moment we stepped foot on the resort, we loved it - Jessica Castrejon gave us a tour and answered all our questions. We booked our wedding that day!! She was such a delight to work with and continued to check in with us throughout the planning process.   
  
We then worked with Kerry Elise on all the wedding day logistics - from food tasting, to reviewing all the little details, and of course my 100 emails throughout the planning process. She was there EVERY step of the way. Kerry was always accommodating and available - whether it be via email or phone... and she always did it with a smile on her face. She genuinely cares about you and ensures you have the best wedding possible. I truly would have been lost without her. Words cannot describe how thankful I am for her!!   
  
A huge thank you to Kerry, Jessica, and the entire staff.

It was a dream

Mission Inn has become our home away from home. My husband and I went to so many venues around Florida; name a town, we looked. None of them felt right until we drove onto Mission Inn’s property. Everyone was so welcoming and accommodating. We fell in love with La Hacienda and Plaza de Palmas but always dreamed of an oak tree for our ceremony. Jessica made sure that dream came true. Our ceremony was a bit off the beaten path and could not have been more perfect for us. Kerry was our catering manager and she went above and beyond for us. She answered any and all questions and helped guide us every step of the way. I can’t say enough how thankful we are for her. Our wedding felt like a fairytale and all the little details were flawless. If there were hiccups, I was blissfully unaware of them because of how well managed everything was. We loved that our guests could stay on property when our reception went on into the night and we loved even more that we could do the same. Mission Inn’s team made sure we had champagne, food, and cake waiting for us in our room with a surprise gift to end the perfect night. We can’t wait to go back and celebrate our anniversary at our favorite place.

The Mission Inn is a dream to work with!! 

The best choice we made while planning our wedding was choosing to have it at the Mission Inn. My mother suggested we have a look at the venue, as it was nearby another one we were touring. We really weren't thinking we'd end up choosing a golf resort as our venue, but they blew everyone else out of the water. They had many venue locations for us to look at and ended up falling in love with the Courtyard area at Legends. We were blown away by their packages and offers; it was the best of what we had seen offered out of all the other venues in Central FL we had looked at. We had also gone in December and were given a Black Friday deal where they provided the DJ. We booked in December 2019 for a March 2021 wedding. Of course, Covid had other plans, and we ended up deciding to push back our date to 2022. They were extremely helpful in getting us rebooked, it was fairly painless.   
  
We mainly worked with Helen R. She was fantastic! She saw to all of our needs and she made sure all of our questions and concerns were addressed. She was very communicative with us and gave us brilliant suggestions of vendors when we ended up having to move the date (as some of our previously selected vendors were not available on the new date). Helen really spent a lot of time going over the details of our wedding and making sure we were happy with the arrangements.   
  
We were hesitant to book a place that was going to provide the catering without having tried some of the food. We looked up other reviews about the Mission Inn and in nearly all of them; I mentioned that the food was great, so that won us over. So here's another review to attest to that! THE FOOD WAS AMAZING! We absolutely loved the food for our rehearsal dinner and for our reception! I am looking forward to being able to eat there for our future anniversaries!   
  
We enjoyed our honeymoon suite and our wedding guests said they liked their rooms. We really enjoyed relaxing by the pool. Our stay was overall really pleasant. My advice would be if you end up booking, have your guest book rooms EARLY for your wedding date!  
  
  
Each vendor we booked made comments about how they enjoyed working with the Mission Inn; almost like it was a relief to them we had booked Mission Inn for our venue. So that was comforting to know that as we were planning everything. Sure enough, there were no issues between the Mission Inn and our other vendors. The Mission Inn is -very- good at managing their weddings. While checking in the day before our wedding, I overheard a conversation where one of the staff informed a guest that there were SEVEN weddings happening that weekend. I was a little worried when I heard that, but really it was all fine; I saw hints that other weddings were going on, but never did I feel like I was sharing space with another bride, nor did our parties overlap at all.   
  
I can confidently say based on our experience, that booking with the Mission Inn is a solid decision. It's going to make your planning so much easier and you will have a fantastic day. We loved our wedding! We wish we could do it all over again. We loved it so much! Thank you to all the Mission Inn staff for making it a truly amazing day for us!!!
