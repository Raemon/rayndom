They Made My Wedding A Day To Remember!

I hired DC Entertainment for my wedding on March 24, 2019. Not only were they very professional in the planning process, they offered me a very intimate look at what they had to offer. DJ Suppamillz gave me a listening sample of his DJing skills and Cynthia sat with me and went over all the fine details of my wedding day from start to finish. Of course my actual wedding day was aaalllll over the place, as weddings are, but Cynthia remained fun and lively as my MC, and kept control of a very crazy wedding day! And DJ Suppamillz played all the requests from my personal playlist and kept the party vibe going! They even had beautiful florescent light displays that lit up the party into the evening hours! Very professional, absolutely fun, and yes i will book them again for future events!

Best DJs Ever!

Amazing DJs! We had a teenage grad party and they had music for everyone. People couldn’t stop dancing and 2 weeks later, they are still telling me how much fun they had. Thank you Deon and Cynthia! You guys are truly the best!

Wedding Coordinator/Decorator

Cynthia was the blessing we needed to ensure our special day would go smoothly. Prior to our special day we met in person a few times to discuss decorating visions, vendor list, and timeline. She showed us her portfolio, sent us templates for our timeline, and recommended vendors. It was also a plus that Cynthia also has other items to provide because trying to keep a wedding on budget is hard and Cynthia understood. Her tablecloths came in clutch! The days leading up to our special day we did a walk through and Cynthia continued to show her professionalism and her key eye. I tried to give her as much information on how I wanted my wedding to look. I was a bit overwhelmed and added Pinterest photos as inspiration. Y’all, let me tell you when my husband and I walked into our venue before our guests showed up, my jaw was on the floor. CYNTHIA BLEW IT OUT OF THE WATER! It was better on how I envisioned it. I cried. Everything was perfect. Her team always made sure Miguel and I were taken care of. Made sure we ate, had a drink, and most importantly made sure we were having fun. Our wedding day was the best day of our lives. We had the most fun and wish we could go back in time to relive the day. I HIGHLY recommend DC Entertainment. I had already hired a DJ prior to finding DC Entertainment so I can only imagine what this business has to offer. You will be taken care of! Please do not pass up DC Entertainment! Cynthia words cannot describe how grateful for your services, literally God sent! Thank you for making Miguel and I’s day so special. Definitely will be booking you for parties in the future and sharing your services to anyone who asks me for vendors!

Book with them ASAP! 10/10 Worth It

They were the best! From the first time we met until the day of the wedding, they were first-class! They were so helpful during the planning process and they went above and beyond as my fiancé and I were putting finishing touches to our wedding. Most of all... they created such a FUN atmosphere! From the music to the lights, the DJ booth, etc. everything was top of the line! I would a 1000000% recommend DC promo to anyone who is having an event in SoCal! The music was diverse and they did a great job mixing our list of preferred songs, with guest request, as well as playing songs that matched what the party was enjoying! Seriously book DC Promo.. you WON'T be disappointed!

Absolutely Amazing!

Absolutely hands down best decision I made was to hire Cynthia and her team. As the day of coordinator she was amazing at helping me set up my center pieces and being the go to person for my vendors. Husband and I were able to enjoy our day to the fullest. She was a delight to work with. Her and her team are the full package, sound and dj were amazing! They had all my guest on the dance floor. They will not disappoint!

Excellent and professional service!! Highly recommend!! 

I have no words to say how happy I was with Cynthia and her team. She communicated throughout the entire process, did sweet gestures like iron our tablecloths, bring ice, make signature drinks. Her and her team were there from beginning to end, set up, decorated, serve, DJ was amazing, clean up ! She literally did it all!! I highly recommend DC Entertainment!!!!
