Recommend Tamara 100%!!! Amazing

We weren’t sure if Indian food would work for a mixed crowd, but Tamara proved us wrong in the best way. Every single guest, even the picky eaters went back for seconds. The flavors were bold but balanced, and the presentation was gorgeous. They even customized a few dishes to match our theme colors! It felt like they really cared, not just about the food, but about us. So grateful we found them.

Food that stole the show!!

Tamara catered our outdoor wedding and honestly they nailed it, everything was superb. Food was top level, and don’t even get me started on the dessert shooters!! gone in seconds haha. The staff was on time, super friendly, and made everything feel easy. We didn’t have to worry about a thing. They made the food part of our wedding feel like a celebration in itself. Thank you Tamara, my family and I are very satisfied.

Tamara was 10/10!!! So happy we chose you guys!! Thank youuuu

We hired Tamara Modern Indian Cuisine for our wedding catering and people still won’t stop talking about the food. My grandma said some dishes reminded her of home, which was a huge plus because she is a very hard critic. The catering team was so friendly and professional, set everything up beautifully and were very organized. 10/10 would recommend!! Thank you for a wonderful experience.
