Amazing!!!

We hired Joseph for our wedding cocktail hour and he was absolutely incredible. He set the perfect vibe—elegant but lively—and his music really elevated the entire experience. Super professional, showed up early, and played beautifully throughout. Honestly, his rate was more than fair for the quality and atmosphere he brought. Highly recommend if you want your event to feel extra special!

Extremely disappointed and stressful experience- Would not recommend 

Please, Please take a moment to read this review to save yourself significant heartache and stress. I would absolutely not recommend or hire Ambient Experiences, Ambient Strings, or Joseph Meeks for any special event—especially a wedding.  
  
As the mother of the bride, my only wish was for my daughter’s wedding day to be beautiful and seamless. Unfortunately, our experience with this vendor was nothing short of horrible.  
  
Initially, things seemed fine. We signed a contract and had a Zoom call to discuss expectations, timeline, and performance details. However, about a month and a half before the wedding, communication declined significantly. My daughter received no responses to her texts, and I had to call multiple times before receiving a return call.  
  
We had clearly discussed that Joseph would arrive 30 minutes prior to the ceremony to play music in the chapel while guests were arriving. When he had not shown up, I had to call him at 3:30 PM to ask if he was still planning to attend. Only after that call did he respond, stating that he was en route and having issues with his violin. Our wedding coordinator also attempted to reach him due to growing concern.  
  
He ultimately arrived at the actual ceremony start time, not early as agreed. Guests were already seated, and his late arrival caused disruption as he began setting up equipment during the ceremony timeline. To make matters worse, he brought his wife with him, who appeared visibly stressed and was dressed in casual street clothes (jeans, sweater, and boots), which was highly inappropriate for a formal wedding ceremony.  
  
As my daughter and the bridal party were walking down the aisle, pre-recorded music was playing, and when the violin performance began, the sound was screeching and extremely unpleasant. It was embarrassing and heartbreaking, especially during such an important moment. I was completely mortified.  
  
Additionally, during cocktail hour, he did not perform in the previously discussed location at the gazebo. Instead, he plugged in his equipment and stood directly by the doorway where guests were exiting, which was awkward and not at all what had been planned or agreed upon. There was no communication about this change. I am also unsure whether he even stayed for the full hour contracted, as there was no clear indication of when he left.  
  
Overall, this experience was incredibly stressful, poorly executed, and deeply disappointing. A wedding day is not the time to deal with lack of communication, late arrivals, technical issues, or unprofessional behavior. Based on our experience, I would strongly advise others to look elsewhere for live music for their special events.
