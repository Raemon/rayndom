Working with the High Desert Museum was an absolute pleasure. It's an incredible venue with lots of different options locations for the ceremony, reception, after party, and photos. Their team cares about you and your wedding day, and you can tell that they strive to cater to whatever you'd need. Their setup for our dinner, cake cutting, and toasts was beautiful. Their food was absolutely delicious and was made in house, we had 2 guest with strict vegan and gluten free diets, and the meal that was provided to them was, "The best meal they've ever had". Overall, the experience was amazing, we can't wait to come back with our future little ones and relish in the memories we made here.

Wow, a wedding at an aquarium... where you and your guests have the - entire - place to yourselves to explore... heck yes, that's a memorable wedding! Can you imagine a cooler place to get married? It's so fun and so magical all at the same time. They have indoor space for a rain plan, all the tables and chairs you'll need for free, a dance floor, and a no-decorations-needed event space. Jo, the event coordinator, was really great about working with the little unexpected kinks that popped up. And Carrie was a pleasure to work with during the planning process, too. I'd highly recommend this venue if your guests don't mind the drive.

I cannot say enough good things about Wildlife safari. Sandy took care of all the issues that came up. She is very friendly and helpful and made things easy. Thank you so much. Her staff is very friendly and helpful. They answer your questions and are very easy to work with. My daughters wedding was wonderful. She had such a great day. We had Taini the Cheetah at the wedding and the guests loved being able to see her up close. It was very special. A++++ for the Safari!

We had our wedding ceremony here and the Theater Director Rosemary was really friendly and open to all of the different ideas I had for the ceremony. I was able to walk through the space more than once to take a look at it, and I was given a lot of flexibility with rental time and what we could do with the space. I didn't have a lot of added decoration because the theater is absolutely beautiful. They also had a lot of comments on what they have done in the past, which gave me a lot of ideas on what we could do for our wedding. Rosemary had a quick response to all of the questions I had along the way. I had also forgotten to select pre-wedding music for when guests are being seated, but they had some music on hand that worked perfectly. They were great for coordinating the actual ceremony and the rehearsal helped make sure the wedding went smoothly. There weren't many stipulations on what you can't do in the space, so it's pretty flexible. The theater seemed willing to accommodate nearly anything we wanted to do, but we kept it simple. The only negative part of the space is the lighting is pretty horrible for photographs. The ceremony itself turned out perfect, but almost all of my photos turned out pretty dark. I would definitely recommend this for a ceremony location if you want a non-church wedding in a beautiful remodeled older building. They also have a reception room that is really nice, but I wanted an outdoor reception.

We had our reception in the Sunken Ballroom and it was phenomenal. The space is lovely and perfect for weddings, and the staff was very warm and accommodating. The option to let your guests wander through the art gallery for part of the event was such a cool added bonus that was much appreciated by our guests. I would highly recommend this space!

BEST ceremony and reception venue ever. Indoor and outdoor space - inside is all blank white walls and great lighting so you can really do anything you want in terms of decor. We were able to set up the entire day before and they were amazingly helpful with all of our set up and cleanup. Best people to work with and you can feel treating knowing your money goes to such a great venue/mission that supports local artists. Couldn't be happier with our decision on venue!
