The best day ever!!

I want to go back and do it all again. From the planning to the wedding day, everything was perfect. We chose the venue because it was so beautiful, but the team we worked with made the choice the best. Wedgewood Weddings does it all!! We worked with all of their recommended vendors, and they exceeded our expectations. The DJ knows how to get the party started. Our bartender kept the drinks flowing. And our captain kept everything running smoothly. I didn't have to worry about a thing. I am so happy we chose San Ramon Waters, I would make the decision again if I could.

Beautiful venue & easy planning

Planning a wedding when you have no idea where to start can be seriously daunting, but the team at San Ramon made everything so much easier. From my very first contact with them to the day itself, they were always available to patiently answer every panicked question I threw their way.  
  
The venue itself is gorgeous. And that ceremony site! It was everything I had envisioned.  
  
Our guests are still talking about how beautiful and seamless the day was. Much of the credit goes to the venue coordinators. They were so helpful and I never felt pushed or pressured.  
  
For any laidback couple planning a wedding and hoping to keep stress levels low, I highly recommend checking out San Ramon. Going into the process, I had no vision but with their support ended up with my dream wedding!!

The Perfect Wedding Does Exist

Planning a wedding in California while living in Texas seemed like a daunting task, but San Ramon Waters by Wedgewood made it so, so easy and helped our vision come to life! Is there such thing as a perfect wedding? Because that's what we felt we had and it's all thanks to the staff at this venue. From the day we toured the venue through our wedding day, they were there for us. Any questions we had, we emailed them, and they would respond within MINUTES sometimes. Their responsiveness and communication was top notch and made planning a breeze. Their wedding planner binder had every detail we could think of, and the to-do timeline recommendations helped keep us on track throughout. We used all of their recommended vendors besides the photographer, and it was just so easy. We're still in shock about how stress-free the planning process was because of their team. Fast forward to the actual wedding day - it flowed seamlessly. The food was AMAZING. The drinks were flowing even though our families kept them running around with all those shots 🤣 We just felt supported from start to finish and can't say enough about them! They went above and beyond. The little things they did helped make the day even more special - they kept asking us if we needed anything. When we sat down at our table, they had a cute photo printed out that they sneaked during our bridal party photo session. They packed us two plates of the dinner meal to take home. We can go on and on! And we haven't even mentioned how BEAUTIFUL the actual venue was. It was a dream and we are so grateful for how they made our dream come to life.

Making Dreams Come True

My now husband and I decided to plan our wedding in less than two months with a strict budget. We could not have done it without Wedgewood and their amazing staff.   
My sister (Maid of Honor) advised me to look for a place that would provide as much as possible to avoid having to coordinate with vendors due to the short time frame. I narrowed my searches down to two venues, both of which ended up being Wedgewood. I immediately fell in love with the location in San Ramon. The venue was beautiful and after sitting with the event coordinator, it was a done deal.   
The weeks that followed, everything fell into place. The coordinators and staff at Wedgewood were so easy to work with and so accommodating. They made sure that all the details were covered. The DJ/Emcee, Chris played a major part in calming our nerves the day of the wedding by ensuring us that he was with us every step of the way. I can't say enough about the coordinators, staff and servers, they made our event a memorable one.

The most magical night we could’ve asked for!

We had the most special and magical night we could have ever asked for! I am so thankful for the Wedgewood team for helping us make our dream wedding come to life. The venue has such great photo opportunities and their employees went out of their way to make sure that we had everything we needed throughout the night.   
The planning experience was stress free and Wedgewood makes it so easy to stay up to date with everything you need for your wedding to be a success with their planning binder. It was amazing to have so many vendors provided through Wedgewood and not have to worry to try to find them ourselves. We both had an unforgettable night and our guests had so much fun. Thank you so much Wedgewood!

Budget Friendly and Stress Free

Great location, great staff, great price!  
My now husband and I wanted something easy, budget friendly and as low stress as possible.   
From the very beginning they made it so easy to pick and chose what we wanted while being able to stay in our budget.   
The staff was super kind and professional. Our process was fun and I really actually enjoyed our experience.   
Definitely recommend if you are searching for a one stop shop that can work with any budget!

Best Wedding Venue! 

We recently had our wedding here and it was amazing! You should look no further than Wedgewood Weddings San Ramon. The staff here are exceptional and really do care about each couple they work with.  
  
1\. Staff: I had the pleasure of working with Mandy and Ivonne for the planning process and these women are just amazing! They work hard to solve any issues that may come up and genuinely do their best to make the experience as easy and enjoyable as possible. I could not thank them enough for such a wonderful experience. My day of coordinator Selena and banquet manager, Ashley were also top notch. Selena was so helpful on the day of to make sure everything was set up as I envisioned. They were checking in with me through out the night to make sure everything ran smoothly and that I had everything I needed.  
2\. Wedding Cake and Desserts: Old Town Bakery hands down did an amazing job. Our cake was almost too beautiful to cut and was super moist. They also did some desserts for us and everyone of guests were raving about how great they were. I would go back to them for future events in a heart beat. My only regret was not asking for the cake to get wrapped up after it was passed out so that my family could have taken it home as by the end of the night since we were staying at a hotel, we could not keep the cake.  
3\. Dublin Floral: Overall the flowers were nice for our centerpieces that were included in our package.  
4\. DJ Martin: DJ Martin was great. He checked in with us a couple days before the wedding to really get to know us a bit and what we wanted for the day of. He was great at keeping with our timeline and giving us prompts. He also was really flexible and easy to work with when we ran a little behind on some of the speeches.  
5\. Food: I was a little nervous that we did not get to do a tasting of the food beforehand but OMG did they impress me and my guest. The appetizers were yummy but the star was the duet plate of baked salmon and mini filet mignon . The salmon was incredible moist and flavorful. I am still at awe how they got each filet mignon to be perfectly cooked at a medium rare for all my guest. It is definitely one of the better wedding dinners I have had and all my guest agreed.  
  
Overall we were so glad we went with Wedgewood Weddings! Their all inclusive package is a great deal and they really do not skip on the service. Of all the venues I visited before choosing Wedgewood, I do not think any of them could have delivered in terms of excellent service they provided. If you are looking for a wedding venue, look no further than Wedgewood Weddings San Ramon! It would be hard to get the value and level of service elsewhere.

Our Big Day 

It was really important for the both of us to have our wedding at a venue that we would share with our friends and families and a day that we would remember time after time! We got just that at The Wedgewood San Ramon! During the planning process with Olivia, Sarah, and Mandy I couldn’t have asked for a more professional, organized, nice group! We did the elite package and the vendors we used were amazing! Dublin Florals, Old Town Danville Bakery, and Pearlsia Decor made our wedding look so romantic and beautiful! You also have to ask for DJ Chris for your wedding! He was so fun and kept the whole night going! We got married in July 2019 in the evening. We are so glad we did! We had the most beautiful sunset setting at the ceremony! My friends and family still talk about our wedding. They said it was one of the most beautiful and fun weddings that they have been to. Congrats if you just got engaged and are searching for that perfect place to get married! I highly recommend The Wedgwood San Ramon venue. You will be in good hands every step of the way! Jennevi & Kirk

Wedgewood San Ramon made my wedding dream come true! 

My fiancé then & husband now were planning a wedding in less than 40 days! Wedgewood San Ramon took care of us those entire 40 days. Mandy, our wedding coordinator was super friendly as was the rest of the staff. I have so much to say about this venue & about the staff. They made our wedding a dream!!! Every single guest said it was a wedding like in the movies!!! & I will not lie, it truly felt like it was. Ivonne, our banquet captain took great care of us & our guests. When we came the first time to see the venue, Olivia showed us around & made sure to stay in touch with us after. Overall, this is the place to get married at. I was stressed out but that was all on me. Mandy & the rest of the staff made sure this wedding was stress free the day of & let me tell you, they succeeded in that. Thank you all so much we cannot emphasize how grateful we are for you all at wedgewood for making our dream happen!!!! We wish we could do it all over again. Will for sure renew our vows here!!! Do not think twice, book this venue ASAP I promise you will not regret it! Love you all at Wedgewood my husband & I are more than 100% satisfied!
