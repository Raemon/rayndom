Barn Stay was a dream come true. Working with Tami and Randy was so easy, they are the most kind and genuine people. Their property has SO much to offer and we utilized it to the max. We had the venue from Thursday-Sunday for our wedding and did a rehearsal night, welcome night, and wedding. Three full on events in three days - everything all in the same spot. We were able to sleep all of our bridal party and parents in the house with us and it made the weekend that much more special. It was so relaxed and beautiful and truly dreamy - we are so happy it’s an Airbnb and hope to get the opportunity to go back and make more memories there in the future. It holds a special spot in our heart. Between the stunning greenery, pond, chickens, koi fish, willow tree, tent, silos, and the way the place lights up at night, you cannot go wrong with this magical place.

We had our wedding with Destination Kohler in September 2016. We spent 5 days enjoying everything the venue has to offer and did not have to worry once. We organized our wedding to be a mini destination (from Chicago) weekend for our guests and Kohler exceeded our expectations with every event. We held a Golf Lunch, Rehearsal Dinner and Cocktail Reception at Blackwolf Run. The lunch was complete with a dedicated driving range and two very accommodating instructors who spent time giving our guests tips on their golf swing. Both our Rehearsal Dinner and Cocktail Reception were held in the Enclosed Terrace - the food and service were amazing and we received constant compliments on the space. We had our Ceremony and Reception at Whistling Straits and when unexpected rain interrupted our outdoor ceremony, everyone on staff was quick to pass out umbrellas and move our wedding party and guests inside. I could not be more impressed with how quickly they help us change plans and got everyone settled! From the moment we chose Kohler, everything was taken care of and it is because of their staff that we truly had the chance to enjoy our wedding.

This was a perfect day and the venue was wonderful. The wedding planner and communication with all people there were above and beyond expectations. From the tasting weeks before and the follow up and set up for the wedding we could not be any happier with this event.

We cannot recommend Rustic Manor enough!!! We were looking for a wedding venue that had both great indoor and outdoor spaces, and Rustic Manor DOES NOT disappoint on this. We had a slightly rainy day, but we were still so happy being indoors since the barn is so beautiful and spacious. We were still able to take all of our pictures on the beautiful Rustic Manor land, and our guests loved spending time outside during cocktail hour playing yard games. Outside of the beautiful venue space, our favorite part about Rustic Manor are the add-ons. We highly recommend adding the Photo Booth - it kept the guests busy all night and was definitely worth every penny! We also had Ashley as our Month of Coordinator and she was AMAZING. She created a timeline for us, made sure we stayed on that timeline, coordinated with our vendors, ensured all of our decorations were set up and taken down, and so much more. She took so much stress off of us and we cannot be more thankful for her and the rest of the RM team for making our wedding day so perfect! We also booked photography through Rustic Studios - David was absolutely fantastic and we are so excited to see our photos. I truly cannot think of a single negative thing to say. Overall, this place has it all. Highly recommend!

Our experience working with Brighton Acres was absolutely wonderful! Kourtney was incredibly responsive and helpful throughout every stage of the wedding-planning process. She helped put us at ease and made us feel confident that everything would be taken care of as the big day approached. On our wedding day, the team went above and beyond. The set-up was flawless, transitions were seamless, and the staff handled every detail with care. The owners and the entire Brighton Acres staff truly did an amazing job, and we can’t thank them enough for how beautifully everything turned out. We also highly recommend Bloomtique Floral. Gena created stunning floral arrangements and table settings that perfectly tied everything together. We couldn’t be happier with how everything looked and turned out!

E had to postpone our original 250 guest wedding due to Covid. When things were a little better under control we decided two weeks out to have our ceremony and a small dinner and plan a big reception later. We found the mini weddings being held at Badger Farms and decided to go have a look. We knew immediately that we wanted to have our wedding in their adorably decorated barn. It was beautiful and beautifully setup and decorated. The outside space was well maintained and perfect for social distancing. We were able to have our ceremony under their big oak tree and it could not have been more perfect. Dave and Betsy (the owners) were responsive and helpful from the moment we met them. They were there the whole time making sure everything went smoothly (and it did!). It made the whole day stress free. They also have a ton of table and other decorations for use. Our wedding could not have turned out better!

We had the most wonderful time working with Nancy and Sugarland for our wedding. I had a lot of questions throughout the planning process (very type A) and she answered all of my questions in a timely manner with helpful responses. The venue itself is gorgeous and doesn't need a lot of decor for the wedding itself. No uplighting/additional lighting or anything to put on the walls necessary! Helps cut down on decor cost a bit and set up time a lot because you don't have to cover the venue, you can let it shine. The ceiling fans help to cut the heat on a hot day, and we did not need it but I'm told there were heating options as well. The accommodations were really nice to have both for getting ready and for hosting guests from far away (and yourselves). It can be a bit difficult to find hotels in Mazomanie for guests traveling from the east, but Sauk to the north and Spring Green to the west both had plentiful accommodations. They also offer camping (one RV hookup, unlimited RV parking, tent, truck, etc.). Our photos were gorgeous, which can be credited to both the photographer and the stunning venue. If a problem occurred, the staff quickly resolved it, and were great to work with. They did have an exclusive caterer, The Old Feed Mill, which Nancy runs. The food is really really good and they were the staff working the venue. We had a great experience having The Old Feed Mill as our caterer. I would recommend Sugarland to anyone getting married in the area!
