I am so impressed with this company! Their customer service is top-notch—the team was professional and incredibly helpful. When trying to accommodate 100+ people in a party at your house with only 1 bathroom, this made things so much easier. There were even options to customize what you may need for your event in each bathroom and took so much thought and worry off my list of things to do. A truly fantastic experience from start to finish.

We used Ahead with Class for our wedding and couldn’t have been happier. The bathroom trailers were clean, had enough space, and well maintained. The amenity baskets were such a thoughtful touch and made our guests feel taken care of. Everything was dropped off and picked up right on time with no issues. The entire process was easy and stress free, which was exactly what we needed. I highly recommend them for any event.

We had an excellent experience, the employee that delivered and set up our facilities was kind and patient with us. GPS took him to the wrong address, which was a narrow dirt road, and he was able to navigate his way through that area over to my location, then took the time to strategically place the unit in the best position for our needs. He took extra care making sure that the ramp was perfect and there were no rough edges for our guests to get caught on. I would definitely recommend this company in the future.

Heather and her team are absolutely the best!!! I had my wedding back in October on Cape Cod, and I felt so heard and taken care of. Every detail was remembered, and the tent as well as linens and glasses were stunning. I had a very specific vision in mind, and they really made it come to life. Walking into my wedding tent made me cry, just seeing how all the little things I mentioned had come together with such care. They also worked seamlessly with my other vendors. This is a business that is top tier. I encourage anyone with an event, whether it is a wedding or any other celebration, to give Heather a call.

I used Baystate for wedding rentals and the whole process from start to finish was a breeze. They made sure to check in after I requested a quote as a reminder to finalize my order. Once I signed the contract I was then able to confirm a specific delivery date which helped immensely with planning. The delivery guys were professional and so efficient. They delivered and set everything up in the right place so we didn't have to do heavy lifting when they were gone.

Classical Tents is just the best. I've never worked with a group of people who are more responsive, helpful, detail-oriented, and just so lovely! They helped make sure we had absolutely everything we needed for a perfect wedding -- thinking of the details my husband and I never would have thought about. From start to finish, they helped us bring our vision to life. And as a plus, the guys who set up and took down our tent were the BEST. What an excellent group of people! We can't recommend them more. Photo credit to Abigail Fenton.
