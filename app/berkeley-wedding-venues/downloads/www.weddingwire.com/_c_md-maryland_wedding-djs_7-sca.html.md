DJ Jimmy T was the absolute best! His professionalism and communication was more than we could ask for. His attention to detail didn’t go unnoticed, especially with the cold sparks! Our wedding was on my parents anniversary and he was able to accommodate their request for an anniversary dance with ease. He brought the party to our wedding and made it a night we won’t ever forget. We couldn’t recommend him enough!

Dan and his team were fantastic! They were excellent in their communications prior to the wedding and made it easy for us to provide required information. They did music for both the ceremony and reception and I was a bit worried since they weren’t part of the rehearsal and we had many different songs to play for the ceremony procession. It was done perfectly!!! They arrived on time and had everything set up and had all that they needed. He handled our announcements and had a fantastic, professional yet fun attitude. The music was great and he ensured all were having fun. He provided uplighting (in our tent and our trees) which really made the event come alive. We highly recommend Dan and his team!!!

Working with Chris for our wedding was an immense pleasure. We began working with him a year and a half before our ceremony, and he was a super big help through the whole planning process. For the day of, he was super on point for the sound cues, and he made a great hype man/emcee. Overall, I would highly recommend working with Chris for your wedding. We had lots of compliments on the music choices and the atmosphere.

We absolutely LOVED working with DJ Brandon! Not only was he professional, he took our quirkier requests in stride. We asked for musicals to play during our cocktail hour and our guests were so surprised and thrilled when they realized what was going on! We loved that he also set up some music to play in the lobby of our venue, it just added another special touch. When our dads refused to use the provided microphone (shoutout to the greatest speeches hardly heard), he very kindly, but firmly, made sure that the other speech givers would actually use the microphone. People were out on the dance floor the whole time and everyone had a blast! 20/10 would recommend DJ Brandon!

We had an excellent experience from initial contact all the way to the last song at our ceremony! MusicMasters/Dan and Sue are great to work with in getting our contract set up and walking us through the portal to start curating our custom playlist/timeline/etc. We also thoroughly enjoyed working with DJ Brent! He was attentive/responsive to our needs and adapted as needed to make sure everything moved smoothly. HIGHLY recommend!!

We couldn’t have asked for a better DJ! Jason kept the timeline running smoothly and had everyone out on the dance floor. He knew exactly how to read the room and brought the fun nonstop. Our guests are still talking about how great the music was!

Sue and Don truly made us, as well as our guests, feel like we had known each other for several years. Their love and dedication to us as the bride and groom were more than apparent. Sue is not only a great MC but also has the maternal instinct to make sure the bride keeps it together throughout the entire day and evening. She helped keep me calm in times of heightened emotion, and she has an AMAZING talent for bustling a wedding gown! Sue and Don met with my husband and I shortly before our wedding to review all of our song details in full. They delivered countless early 2000's hits, just as we requested, and kept the dance floor engaged all night! Our wedding was truly a blast and such a special night because of them, and we couldn't thank them enough. They are a 20/10 choice for your DJ entertainment.

Frank DJ’d for our wedding celebration this past weekend. He made sure everything went smoothly. He played every song we had requested and even some from the crowd! He always kept the party going and went above and beyond even making sure my husband and I got something to eat! We couldn’t recommend him enough!
