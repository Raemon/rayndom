I didn't want to spend a lot of money on my invitations and save the dates, so the employees at Cheers Personalized worked with me on a couple occasions to find ones that fit my budget and preferences. My save the date envelopes came in wrong, but they were able to fix that in 2 days. I loved the results and I got lots of compliments on my invitations and save the dates.

I would highly recommend working with Elegant Statements. Erin was very accommodating and professional, yet fun to work with! She spent hours with me on the phone talking about what I wanted (as I lived far away from her and it was hard for me to meet with her) and my “vision” came out exactly how I wanted it. She was very flexible as to when I needed to assemble my invites by and helpful as to how to do it. I liked the fact that you can tailor your invites to whatever you want and create something of your own. You don’t have to have a cookie cutter invite you pick from a website or store. I also loved the fact that she printed everything for us, but we were able to assemble them on our own, which saved us some money. Gotta love wedding budgets! She also offers envelope addressing as an add-on, and it was so worth it! Our invites turned out perfect! I have gotten so many compliments on them. He prices are very reasonable compared to other vendors in the Milwaukee area. Overall, Erin was a pleasure to work with, and I had a lot of fun talking about what I wanted, and then seeing it come to life was wonderful! Thank you Erin!

My fiance and I were super overwhelmed when we started the wedding planning and weren’t quite sure where to start, but knew a general idea for our save the dates and invites. Tasha made the entire process so easy and not stressful at all. She went above and beyond what we expected and everything she designed and printed for us turned out beautiful and perfect. She ended up doing out save the dates, invites and cocktail orders all with personalized sketches. Thank you SO much for playing a role in our day. We’ve gotten so many compliments on everything, they truly are exactly what we envisioned. Tasha was extremely responsive, easy to communicate and work with and made sure everything was exactly how we wanted it. With how stressful bookings and appointments and planning is, this was honestly the least stressful part of our wedding, but also a huge part. Really can’t thank Tasha enough. I would highly recommend her to anyone and will definitely be using her for future needs.

Michele is a true artisan! I have never seen higher quality more perfect invitations in my life! She was unbelievable to work with and made it so fun. Just see the pictures, they speak for themselves. She did our invitations and table numbers. I cannot recommend Blush Paperie enough.
