Hubby and I booked a 6 night stay for our anniversary at Eldorado casitas. We just got back today and it was an amazing and thrilling experience. Would use them over and over again. The whole process of booking to travelling and enjoying our stay at this five star resort was without any glitch. Please don’t think twice, just go ahead and book through them.

I contacted Going Places to book our honeymoon. Melissa Hawkins was very helpful emailing back and forth. She worked researching all inclusive cruise options. Then we changed our mind and decided we wanted to go to an all inclusive resort instead. She was extremely patient and accommodating answering all of my questions. I chose a resort and she made all of the arrangements for our travel and stay at Sunset at the Palms all inclusive adult only resort in Negril Jamaica. We were greeted at the airport and speedily escorted through customs and taken to our transportation. We had a great experience at our resort and would return. Our return transportation to the airport was included and arranged as well. Before our trip, I received all of our travel information organized in a folder. I had a great experienced with Going Places and would use them again in the future if my husband and I decide to plan another trip!

Traci actually recommended a different all-inclusive resort than the one I had originally chosen because the one I chose didn't include bottled water or pop, they charged for it if you took it from the mini fridge. So the switch to the new resort was almost seamless. She even called the resort to see if we got there ok. The only issue was that she forgot to re-book our shuttle when she re-booked resorts. So we ended up having to find transportation to and from our hotel on our own. And in a foreign country that was kind of scary. But it turned out ok. She answered any questions we had in preparation for our first trip overseas and was just as sweet as can be.

Preferred Vacations (PV) is awesome. I would highly recommend them. We had 80 people travel to the Bahamas for our destination wedding and PV handled the whole thing start to finish for our whole group. Preferred Vacations was professional, courteous and great at communication. They take away all the stress of travel, but also get you a way better deal then you will ever find on your own. I spoke with 5 travel agents before settling on Preferred Vacations and they did NOT disappoint. When first speaking with PV, I was mentioning all the things other travel agents told me we had to do ourselves. Preferred Vacations handled it all. I told them what we were looking for, they gave me suggestions, and then walked us through the process. Then, they already had a relationship with the resort we chose, and that made everything even better. They personally set us up with a private deal through the upper management and we were thus treated like kings and queens the whole trip. Everyone of my group of 80 said how great and professional they were and many will be using Preferred Vacations. Thanks again Preferred Vacations for helping to make our wedding weekend the best ever. We will be using you again.

This is my 4th trip with Susan, she goes out of her way to find locations and stays that make the best memories along with adding in insurances and car rentals to make it even easier! I would recommend her to anyone looking to book a vacation from a small weekend trip to a once in a lifetime experience!
