## Wedding Ceremony Music

The music you choose for your ceremony is one of the first elements your guests will experience. Your wedding ceremony music sets the tone for your event and allows you to express your unique personalities on your big day. Think carefully about the songs you want to play during some of the most iconic moments of your wedding.

## Your Wedding Ceremony Music Timeline

Before you can pick the music for your wedding ceremony, you’ll need to understand your wedding ceremony timeline.

## Prelude

The prelude music plays in the background as your guests arrive, exchange greetings and find their seats.

## Wedding Party Processional

Your wedding officially kicks off with the processional. This music will guide the groom or first partner down the aisle, followed by the wedding party.

## Second Processional (Bridal Processional)

The bride, or second partner, gets their own processional song. Traditionally, the music will pause between the first and second processional, and the guests will rise to watch the bride or second partner make their way down the aisle.

## Recessional

Your wedding ceremony is complete and you are married to your true love! The recessional music guides the happy couple and the bridal party back down the aisle. This music should be happy and upbeat; it helps shift the mood from the ceremony to the reception.

## Postlude

This additional music at the end of the ceremony gives guests time to congratulate the new couple or move to the reception venue.

## Theme and Venue of Your Wedding

Now that you have your wedding ceremony music timeline down, how do you choose those magical songs? Think about what type of music fits your theme and venue. If you are getting married in a [church](https://www.weddingwire.com/church-temple-weddings), you may be required to choose religious music for your ceremony or have the officiant approve your choices.

Consider your [wedding theme](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/classic-wedding-style). If you are planning a traditional, black-tie wedding, classical music options are a great idea. If you’re doing something more casual or modern, then you can pick an ’80s ballad or a current pop hit.

## What Songs Are Meaningful to You?

The best way to choose your wedding ceremony music is to think about songs that are meaningful to you and your partner. Is there a song you both love singing in the car? Did one of you propose to the other at a concert? Is there a song that you consider “yours”? These are great options to add to your ceremony.

## Choosing the Right Wedding Musician

It’s time to find a wedding musician. If [budget](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/wedding-budget.html) is a concern, a DJ is a good option. Your DJ can work with you to create your wedding ceremony playlist and make sure the right music plays at the right time. However, there really is nothing like live wedding music. Depending on your taste, you can hire a range of wedding musicians, from a harpist to a quintet, a trio of violins or even vocalists.
