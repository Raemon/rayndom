## About

Point San Pablo Harbor is a stunning wedding venue in the heart of the north and east Bay Area, California. This breathtaking site provides a wonderfully unique and naturally beautiful waterfront venue for a wedding. Located in a hidden corner of Point Richmond, it is secluded and quiet, only 20 minutes from Berkeley or San Rafael and about 40-50 minutes from San Francisco.

From a rustic, intimate gathering to a bohemian luxe affair, Point San Pablo Harbor can bring that dream to life. 

**Services Offered**

Ceremony sites include our waterfront meadow, various BIG ART installations, uphill overlooking the farm and marina, and out at the point of the jetty jutting out into the bay. Host a reception outdoors in the Meadow Pavillion before moving the festivities indoors to the Harbor Clubhouse.

Magical waterfront venue and exceptional support

Point San Pablo Harbor holds a special place in our hearts for many reasons, and now even more so as our wedding venue. All our dreams of a unique experience with creative personal touches were made possible thanks to the marina's perfect location and Yaella, their event director who is a delight to work with. Tucked away amidst gorgeous hills and sprinkled with stunning sculptures, glowing gardens, and breathtaking corners of bliss allows for a ton of flexibility across multiple spaces, all with exceptional vibes. We opted for an intimate afternoon ceremony on the jetty, surrounded by the sparkling Bay and sweeping views perfect for photos. We then transitioned to the big art park for a reception under the impeccably decorated tent, with live music and delicious sunset dinner catered by the marina restaurant–followed by dancing the night away in the clubhouse and partying on the deck amidst sailboats and stars. Spending the night in a beautiful boathouse was the cherry on top. It was a truly wonderful experience from start to finish, with all of the event staff going above and beyond to support us in every way. There couldn’t be a friendlier community and we are infinitely grateful for our lifelong memories made at Point San Pablo Harbor. Highly recommend getting hitched at this enchanting hidden gem!
