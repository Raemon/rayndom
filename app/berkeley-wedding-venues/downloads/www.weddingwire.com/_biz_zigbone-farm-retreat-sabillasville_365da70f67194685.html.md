Zigbone Farm Retreat is a stunning wedding and event venue nestled in the rolling hills and valleys of the Catoctin Mountains, near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and Frederick, Maryland—and only one hour from Washington, DC, and Baltimore. The 100-acre farm features beautifully and naturally restored historic farmhouses and breathtaking views, all combining to create a stunning backdrop for your celebration.

**History**

The Torfs-Leibman family bought the old Rocca farm in 2009 with the vision of transforming its historic buildings and 100 rolling acres into a working farm and nature-inspired retreat complex for celebrations. Today, the vision is realized: the old farmhouse is now the three-story, luxurious ZigBone Eco-Lodge; the springhouse is the romantic, timber-framed Bridal Cottage; and the rambling four-car garage is the Event Hall with an attached, wooden-beamed outdoor pavilion with skylights and chandeliers. Sheep, goats, chickens, and barn cats have their run of the pastures. A 16-bed vegetable garden produces fresh produce for guests, friends, and family. Guests call this place "magical," a "fairy tale," "stunning." We call it ZigBone Farm Retreat -- our dream come true.

**Accommodations**

Zigbone Farm Retreat offers overnight accommodations for up to 25 people on your wedding weekend. The three-story Zigbone Eco-Lodge sleeps up to 23 people and features an eat-in kitchen, hardwood floors, a large dining room, and luxurious, light-filled sleeping rooms. It has a two-story log cabin at its center with a historic brick addition on one side, a naturally built addition on the other, and stone terraces, porches, and patios all around. The Bridal Cottage sleeps up to three people, is handicapped accessible, and features high, wooden-beam ceilings, paned windows, hardwood floors, a private deck, a sleeping alcove, and a writing nook.

**Event Spaces**

Zigbone Farm Retreat offers both indoor and outdoor spaces for an unforgettable ceremony and reception. Outdoor spaces—wisteria-covered stone terraces, timber-framed covered patios, old stone walls, gardens exploding with brightly colored flowers, and wrought-iron gazebos—provide perfect backdrops for an outdoor ceremony on the back lawn. Guests can then move into the Event Hall and under the covered pavilion for dinner and dancing.

**Capacity**

The venue can hold weddings of up to 150 guests and provides overnight accommodations for a total of 25 people.

**Services**

Zigbone Farm Retreat offers many services and packages to meet your needs, from a three-day wedding weekend to an a la carte wedding day tailored to your vision. The venue is available to host ceremonies, receptions, bridal showers, and engagement parties. The wedding-related services include:

  * Event manager
  * Your choice of vendors (we only provide recommendations)
  * Overnight accommodations for up to 25 guests
  * A covered outdoor pavilion (no need to rent a tent!)
  * An indoor hall

Best Decision

Having our October 2023 wedding at Zigbone was the best decision we made. As soon as we arrived for our first visit, we knew it was ‘the place’. We loved being able to have our wedding party (and dog!) stay with us and booked the farmhouse Thursday through Sunday for extra time together. Our goal was to have a weekend full of community and celebration and Zigbone helped it be that and more. Beautiful scenery and accommodations, amazing list of recommended vendors, and communicative and welcoming owners. We couldn’t recommend it enough.

Perfectly Unique and Beautful

We had our wedding at the Zigbone Farm Retreat and it could not have been more perfect. The grounds were stunning. It is so clear that the woman running it care deeply about their property and take pride in making it nice and unique. There were enough rooms for our entire family. The event space was even better than I could have imagined for our wedding and just beautiful in every way. The owners were lovely to work with and extremely kind and accommodating. Would HIGHLY recommend for any event or even just a getaway with a large group of family/friends. Our family and guests adored it. We will certainly be back!

This venue makes everything else easier 

Zigbone Farm was the spiritual heart of our wedding. As soon as we booked this venue, everything flowed from there. Schedule, design and theme, decisions about other vendors and guest list — everything else became easier because this venue provided such a gorgeously strong anchor point in the middle of our special celebration. What more can you ask for? Every single vendor commented on the uncommon beauty and peace of this venue. We loved having our welcome dinner here on Friday night and having a local vendor make pizza in the cob oven. On Saturday when it rained, we didn't have to worry because we knew the lodge house would beautifully accommodate our guests for cocktail hour and that the pavilion and event hall would be fine if the rain didn't stop (it did, and we got a double rainbow!). On Sunday, we hosted a beautiful farewell breakfast. It was so wonderful to be able to have so many friends stay on site with us, and to have some space from them in the bridal suite. Not having to leave the property once during the entire weekend was such a blessing and kept things from feeling too busy or crazy.  
Marijke was our main contact and she was so quick to respond to any questions we had and really fun to interact with.  
She clearly loves this place and has a deep enthusiasm for the couples who celebrate there. Our guests who stayed on site felt so spoiled and kept remarking on how relaxed they felt, that it felt like a true retreat for them even amid a busy schedule of events. We really hope to return to Zigbone for a reunion one day, what a special sacred place. I cannot recommend it enough to any couple marrying. Especially as a queer couple, we felt deeply affirmed, safe and celebrated here. Thank you Marijke and Dena!!

Beautiful, wonderful celebration at the ecolodge

Our celebration weekend at Zigbone was incredible. We booked pretty far in advance, and Marijke was super accommodating, helpful and responsive throughout the entire process. She welcomed us to visit each time we came to the site, from before we booked up until our final site visit and through our celebration weekend. She was also SO responsive via email! The entire venue is so beautiful. It's scenic, and the buildings are lovely. It was so fun to have the entire space for the full weekend, so we could have lodging onsite with our families and have separate spaces for getting ready, a beautiful rustic cabin for my partner and I to stay in, a lovely outdoor covered space for cocktail hour and our welcome party, and a wonderful indoor/outdoor space for our reception. Marijke made sure everything was set up just right day of, and worked seamlessly with our day-of coordinator. I can't recommend Zigbone highly enough -- it was a magical, special, sweet and fun weekend for our commitment ceremony and celebration.

Absolutely gorgeous 

The venue is absolutely gorgeous. Guests were so happy to be on the farm with us, paired with the bridal suite close but private from the rest of the crew. The flowers were beautiful bloomed and we could not have asked for a better venue to host our wedding. It’s the most beautiful venue.

The perfect venue

We had our 120-person wedding at Zigbone this past September and we were absolutely blown away. It was the *perfect* venue for us and our guests. We had about 20 folks stay on-site with us, and it was the most magical weekend that we could have ever imagined. We can't recommend Zigbone enough!

Weekend Wedding Bliss!

Let me just say that Zigbone Farm is truly a magical place. I honestly had the best weekend of my life celebrating our wedding at Zigbone. This venue offers so much more than a traditional wedding venue. The property is absolutely stunning. The accommodations on the property sleep 25 guests. The photos of this house DO NOT do it justice. We knew we wanted a weekend getaway vibe for our closest friends and Zigbone provides exactly that. We were able to host 20+ of our friends for the weekend, we were able to use the outdoor pizza oven for our rehearsal dinner on Friday night, and everyone was able to hang out all weekend without strict guidelines of when the reception had to start and end. The bridal/honeymoon suite on the property is perfect for getting ready and on site hair and makeup and then doubled as a private escape for us at the end of our wedding night. There is so much flexibility with vendors you can bring in and what you can do here. This is not an all-inclusive venue. However, I liked that I could personalize our wedding experience without being locked in to specific vendors and timelines. Our guests could not stop raving about how beautiful the house, the property, and the reception space were. The labor of love that went into making Zigbone what it is today is evident in every single detail. There are countless spots inside and outside for gorgeous wedding portraits as well. Lynn, the property manager and coordinator, was so helpful and such a calming, welcoming energy all weekend. She was present whenever we needed her and made sure everything ran smoothly. We had rain Saturday afternoon and Lynn and Duke were ready to set up ceremony chairs the moment the rain stopped so we could still have our outdoor ceremony on time. On Saturday morning she even brought animal crackers to let our guests feed the goats on the farm! Investing such a large amount of money into a single weekend is so scary for many couples, but having our wedding at Zigbone Farm was the BEST decision we made and worth every single penny. If you are on the fence, I encourage you to go visit and meet Lynn. You will feel magic for yourself.

ZigBone is the Perfect Place for a Wedding!

We could not have asked for anything more. First, even though it feels like it's in the middle of nowhere, ZigBone is just over an hour from the DC area. Second, the farm is set on 100 acres among the rolling Catoctin foothills. Third, the buildings include a large lodge that, together with the wedding cottage, can sleep 25 people. Fourth, the event space includes a huge covered pavilion (replete with chandeliers), making an outdoor ceremony and reception possible regardless of rain. And fifth (but not even close to finally), Marijke will make you feel welcome and ensure that everything runs smoothly. The pictures on the website are lovely, but they do not do justice to the structures and grounds. We barely needed centerpieces or other flower arrangements as the gardens were overflowing. I could go on and on, but instead, I urge you to make an appointment to visit ZigBone and then book your wedding (or really, any other special event) there as soon as possible. They fill up quickly!
