Sweetwater Strings performed as a quartet at my wedding in June 2025 in Prescott, AZ. Eily and the quartet gave an incredible performance and were just a pleasure to work with and so kind to us. Everything was very easy in terms of booking/comms and their extensive repertoire is so impressive. I am so grateful and honored that they performed at our wedding and really made our day so special.

Christine was able to customize our music perfectly and her music is absolutely breathtaking. Could not imagine having our ceremony music any other way. very classical and elegant.

Magnolia Strings was one of our favorite vendors! They were timely and quick in responses. More importantly- they really WILL learn any song for you. Being Millennials- my husband and I were wondering if Magnolia Strings could possibly learn "Helena" by My Chemical Romance to play while people were being seating. Not only did they deliver- but we got many compliments on the niche addition. Also- I just thought it would be funny if they played "The Final Countdown" prior to starting the wedding processional- and they also delivered! Although we did pick some more traditional music, they were super kind and awesome in accommodating these unique requests and we could not have been more happy or appreciative of them :)

So glad we selected Obadiah Parker/Mat for our wedding day. Throughout the process he was incredibly responsive and knowledgeable and the live music her provided was exceptional. We mistyped our venue address in error and so appreciate how calmly and professionally that was resolved. He has a beautiful singing voice and makes any song his own; matched the vibe perfectly and expertly curated. Highly recommend!

I really wanted a guitar and mandolin playing for our wedding ceremony and cocktail hour music. I felt the Art of Music had a great selection of both classical and contemporary songs. I really liked their style. They were prompt, professional and played beautifully. Everything I could have asked for.

Mr. David Ice did an outstanding job playing the harp at our wedding. We had originally booked another harpist, but she broke her hand two weeks before our wedding. Thankfully she contacted David, and he stepped up to the plate! This was quite a challenge because we had specifically requested several atypical songs like the Navy's "Anchors Aweigh" (ours was a military wedding) and Toto's "Africa." Further, David's repertoire contains contemporary music arranged for the harp in addition to more traditional pieces. Fast forward to our big day. David... played... marvelously. Despite the near freezing temperatures, his performance was perfect. So many guests mentioned to us later how much they enjoyed his music. David is the consummate professional, and it was a real blessing to have his music part of our special day. We enthusiastically recommend David to anyone who is considering hiring a harpist, wedding or otherwise. You won't regret it!
