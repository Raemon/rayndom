I was surprised when I initially found out that the venue hosts wedding events and caters! Elisa and her team made the entire process A to Z straight forward and supported my husband and I. The venue is great so the guests don’t have to feel like they have to stay on one place. Guests were able to explore the museum and the touch tank was popular!

Thank you so much to RMSC for the wedding of our dreams! And shout out to Danielle for keeping a tight ship sailing on! Many of our guests have reached out to let us know it was the best wedding they've ever been to and we are honored! Ceremony in the planetarium was a dream come true and cocktail hour/reception in the museum was icing on the cake.

It's difficult to put into words just how perfect this was. Choosing a museum as our wedding reception venue was the best idea for our wedding. Our guests were able to enjoy the galleries right before cocktail hours, Central Park - right across the street - made for beautiful portraits, the museum itself is such a classic and chic NYC location - it was just perfect ! I am particularly thankful to Francesca, Samantha, and Chantal who were instrumental in helping us plan, execute, and then clean up after our wedding. You are in good hands with these ladies ! I cannot wait to visit the museum again (the best part!) and know that within the amazing structure I can point out where I had my first dance, where we greeted our guests, and just overall where we had a great day. I strongly recommend non-traditional spaces like this one for wedding receptions - you do have do a little more work (renting chairs, glassware, tables, etc.) but the end result is so very worth it !

Museum of the Moving Image is not your typical wedding venue - which is exactly what we wanted. BG, our venue coordinator was such a pleasure to work with. This was the first venue we visited and instantly knew it was the one for us, a lot of which is down to the level of service BG provided. We had just shy of 100 guests, reception in the main hall, and used the Red Stone Theatre for the ceremony. Our guests LOVED that they had access to the museum throughout the night, it was such a fun and interactive night for them. We're so glad we chose MOMI as our venue and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for something different and quirky, thank you to BG and the whole MOMI team!

The moment we stepped into Robert we knew this was our venue -- the colorful vibes and gorgeous city view spoke to us. We worked with Kristi to plan the wedding reception of our dreams at Robert. Not only was the food and staff phenomenal, but they were flexible about making our dreams come true -- including having a surprise performance from our drag queens! Our guests were blown away by how gorgeous the restaurant was and how delicious and beautifully plated the food was. It was an unbelievably special night. The team at Robert was responsive, professional, and made our wedding experience such a joy. A real highlight of wedding planning was doing the tasting menu at Robert with our moms -- they could not stop raving about the food. Thank you for your attention to detail, promptness, and true excitement for our big day. If we could get married again, we would do it all over at Robert. Thank you all!

We got married this past October and it was everything I had ever dreamed off. From day one, Connie and her staff assisted us with everything, offered great advice, responded quickly, and did everything they could to make our wedding go smoothly. They worked with us during COVID and were flexible and understanding when certain situations came about. The facility is absolutely gorgeous on top of the great service! Highly recommend if you want the Adirondack wedding of your dreams!

The Bronx Zoo was our first vendor choice for Venue back in the beginning of our engagement and we are so glad we were able to finally see everything come together in May 2022! Working with the staff, especially Robyn, was very easy and easy-going but professional attitude made us feel welcomed and in good hands. Robyn made every part of the process extremely easy, even when we had to postpone our original date due to COVID. We contracted with the Zoo for approximately 125 persons and ended up with around 135 persons, which we found there was plenty of space for in the reception hall. Everything ran smoothly the day of - all vendors were able to get to where they needed to be without issue, we had some amazing staff help shuttle us around for photos (and guests to the ceremony site) and they were able to quickly get guests into the Madagascar exhibit when it started to rain after the ceremony. The cocktail hour at the Sea Lion pool and the catering was a big hit with our guests and we also got a lot of compliments on the food. We would highly recommend the Bronx Zoo for any couples looking for a unique, guest pleasing venue.

We had our wedding reception at the gardens last October and it was a fantastic experience! In terms of the event space itself, the botanical gardens is beautiful, and our guests loved being able to see the entire space at night. We appreciated that tables and chairs were provided by the gardens, and we were glad to learn that we could provide our playlists to the event team and have them played over the speakers rather than have to bring our own sound set up. There are outdoor spaces outside of the gardens that are great for outdoor photos as well. The gardens’ event coordinators (Sally and Asher) were extremely responsive and a pleasure to work with both leading up to, and during the event. They were very accommodating, communicated with us to ensure we were on the same page about what we were going for with our event, and handled set-up for the decorations we provided, the tables, etc. Honestly, they made things really easy for us! The cost was also very reasonable. Some mostly minor things to consider that weren’t an issue for us, but might matter more to others: Lighting: while the dining areas were well lit with overhead lighting and string lights, some areas of the gardens are fairly dark at night. Temperature: we were very comfortable in October inside, but the gardens is a greenhouse essentially and can get warm (we were told typically about 10 degrees warmer than outside air), so in warmer months this may be something to consider. Time: we were allotted four hours for our reception-only event. For us this was fine, though it went quickly, but something to consider for those hoping for a longer event. Lastly, the gardens only allows a limited set of vendors for catering. Initially, we were kind of worried by this limitation, but it actually became clear that the vendors’ familiarity with the space and the event team helped the catering experience go very smoothly as everyone knew what to do/expect, and we also had a wonderful experience with the catering (we went with Buffalo Catering Co., which we also recommend!) Our experience was fantastic, everything was beautiful and went smoothly—we highly recommend the gardens!
