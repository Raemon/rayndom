I can’t say enough good things about this venue! From the beautiful river side rehearsal space, large green ceremony spot off the river, gorgeous, luxury lodging & rooms.. and the yummy food.. it’s the perfect spot for a destination wedding! The staff is truly impeccable as well, everyone is so gorgeous on top of their game. Julia Moyers Bijou Weddings by Design

The Union Pacific Dining Lodge was the perfect venue for our dream wedding. The Groom is from Montana and my family is mostly from the East Coast - so it was really amazing to be close to the entrance to Yellowstone. The venue itself is huge, definitely can fit a wedding of over 400 but our wedding was 150ish and we felt cozy but not swimming in the venue. In the larger room there is a huge fireplace that you can have going. Additionally, there is a smaller room (the Firehole) that we used for cocktails and has a bar area and another fireplace. Additional items to note: cute little bridal suite, huge kitchen with everything your caterer needs, almost every type of glasses for the bar (we brought mason jars for beers). Also, all the tables and chairs are provided, including cocktail tables. Rentals are where they get you! So this was perfect for our budget. The pricing includes 48 hours of use, so we used the venue for the rehearsal dinner too. The staff are easy to work with and will make sure you have everything you need! The only con is that the venue is not insulated. It's an old building and has a few heaters but we also brought our own electric heaters. We had our wedding on Sept 28 and it snowed and was 30 degrees most of the weekend. But surprisingly we were not cold at all :)

What can I say other than the Billings Depot is the best wedding venue in Billings, bar none! Marci and her team (shout out to CJ!) truly did an amazing job of making sure everything came together. Marci graciously answered my bazillion questions, accommodated our requests and overall made our wedding truly one of the best days of our lives. They were hands on and made everything easy. We are eternally grateful. Thank you!

My new husband and I have nothing but great things to say about this gorgeous venue! They made it really easy for us. Our wedding was originally planned to be outside at their ranch setting, but due to bad weather, we moved everything into the grand ballroom and it was so much better than we could've imagined! If you're struggling to find caterers, DJ's, or any particular vendors, they will happily point you in the right direction. Overall a wonderful setting for a wedding!
