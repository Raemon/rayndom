Brooke was wonderful to work with. I had to change my wedding date twice and Brooke was so flexible and accommodating. My bouquet was stunning. The Bridesmaids' bouquets, mothers' corsages, Groomsmen's and Grooms boutonnieres were all lovely. She created a beautiful piece for our head table and the guest table centerpieces were lovely! She truly brought my vision to life. I would highly recommend working with her!

Gaby at Pink Opal Florals was amazing! From our first consultation to the wedding day, she was professional, creative, and so easy to work with. Our bouquets, centerpieces, and ceremony arrangements were beyond beautiful and exactly what we envisioned. She also worked within my budget. I can’t recommend her enough!

Linda with Jess Fleur Fun was a pleasure to work with! She was very knowledgeable and skilled at creating beautiful bouquets and floral arrangements! She worked with me to help me stay within a smaller floral budget which I greatly appreciated. She was very accommodating and sent a photo of the bridal bouquet a couple days before our wedding! She was also more affordable than some of the other popular wedding floral companies in Milwaukee, while still providing an amazing service!

As a wedding planner, I’ve had the pleasure of working with House of Flowers for many years, so when it came time for my own wedding, there was never a doubt in my mind who my florist would be. Jim and his team have always impressed me, but seeing them bring my vision to life was such a special experience. From the very first conversation, they completely understood what I was going for and somehow made it even better than I imagined. They were quick to respond, so easy to work with, and their attention to detail was unmatched. My bouquet was truly everything I dreamed of: romantic, timeless, and absolutely perfect. I also loved that I could get so many of my rentals, like linens and accent décor, directly through them. It made the entire planning process seamless and cohesive, and everything came together beautifully on the day. House of Flowers is the definition of talent, professionalism, and heart. I’m endlessly grateful for their work!

Working with Mary at Branching Out was so easy and efficient! At our first zoom call she heard my vision for the wedding and venue space and answered any questions I had! A few emails back and forth to specify exactly what we wanted and picture inspiration and it was better than I could’ve imagined!! So professional and very flexible (as I changed my mind a couple times). I couldn’t have asked for better to work with for our wedding! Highly recommend!!

Our experience with Trellis was probably one of the best parts of wedding planning. I cannot emphasize enough how wonderful and easy it was to work with Courtney and communicate with her (she is so responsive via email and phone, and it was super easy to schedule a call for more in-depth questions). I had an expectation that planning the flowers was going to be complicated and time consuming, but I was totally wrong. I think one of the main reasons why I was wrong was because of Courtney and her clear expertise allowing for her to immediately pick up on the vibe we were going for and what we wanted our wedding to look like. She brought our wedding to life so incredibly beautifully through the flowers and arrangements. I truly gasped walking into our reception seeing the atmosphere she created with the flowers and centerpieces. For the centerpieces, my husband is an architect, and he wanted to build something to be incorporated into the centerpieces. Courtney made it happen. For the reception, I really wanted to incorporate some sort of chandelier with greenery and disco balls at various levels. Multiple florists told me they couldn't do it for various reasons, but Courtney made it happen. So many people also commented on how beautiful the bouquets were - the bridesmaids bouquets were very lush and mine was absolutely stunning. It is all a testament to the quality of Courtney's work. When you talk to Courtney as well, you can just tell that she has a passion for this work and for making things look really beautiful. Plus, she genuinely cares - you are not just another wedding. I truly cannot recommend Courtney enough!! You will not be disappointed!

LOVED petal pushers!!! We used petal pushers for our wedding and we LOVED them! They were so easy to work with throughout the entire process, and really made our visions come to life. My bouquet was exactly how I wanted it based off of my inspiration photos. The bridesmaids bouquets, boutonnières, and corsages were beautiful! We got so many compliments. They delivered right to the church and everything was on time. I would highly recommend petal pushers to all brides/anyone looking for quality floral that is still within budget!!! They are amazing!!
