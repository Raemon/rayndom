They were wonderful in helping to refit and refurbish my grandmother's engagement and wedding rings for me! Everything was done in house so no need to worry about having it sent off somewhere else. They also did a great job of polishing my rings and necklace to make them sparkle and shine for the wedding day!

I had my wedding ring resized before the wedding and they did a really good job and it didn't cost me an arm and a leg.

They are a wonderful hometown jeweler that took care of us in every way. We were able to make payments, they were available when we needed them, got everything cleaned and ready overnight, and we also ordered our service set through them. Very Happy!

Janvier's helped him find the perfect engagement ring when no other jeweler could deliver. Since we did not go with the typical diamond engagement ring and wedding band, they were the perfect people to work with. They flew in gemstones from several contacts so that we had a choice of shapes, colors, and sizes. Other jewelers just said this is all we have, sorry. When it can to the wedding band, they custom created a band to work with and match the engagement ring. Also, they are a delight because they know you by name and then help you out with anything you need. The week before our wedding, my engagement band needed to be not only cleaned but mended, they got it done with plenty of time to spare.

My fiance and I purchased my engagement ring at Riddles. I wanted something a little less traditional and I immediately fell in love with one of their rings. They were very timely with re-sizing it, and I love it. I'm so glad that we went there!

My husband proposed to me with a Bechtold’s ring and I’m so glad he did! He had the opportunity to work with Michaela to hand pick out my band and diamond that went in it. I love that it is personalized to what he thought I would like. Then it was so fun going back to pick out his ring, we worked with Taylor that day. He got to try on various rings of different sizes/widths and it was a very personalized experience. We stop in every time we are in Sioux Falls to say hi and get my ring cleaned and they always greet us with the warmest smiles! 10/10 recommend Bechtold’s!
