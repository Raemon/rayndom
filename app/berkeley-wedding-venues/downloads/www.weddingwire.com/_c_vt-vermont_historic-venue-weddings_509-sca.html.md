We are so happy to have had our ceremony and reception at the Hubbell Homestead. Vicki and Jessica helped guide us through the process and navigate details prior to the day, all the way through to the end of the wedding night. The scenery is stunning, and the landscape is conducive for gathering. Jessica was extremely helpful on our wedding day, from coordinating the possibility of adverse weather to making sure we didn’t have to worry about small details. We had a fabulous experience and would recommend to anyone. We loved being able to show off the gorgeous scenery of our hometown to our family and friends

Red Clover Inn and the owners, Venetia and Mark, made my son and his partner’s wedding truly unforgettable. From the stunning property and spacious, beautifully decorated Inn rooms to their thoughtful ideas and genuine Vermont hospitality, everything came together perfectly for a magical wedding weekend. If you are planning a wedding in Vermont, you must check out the Red Clover Inn. After researching many venues, we knew immediately that RCI was “the one” — it met every one of our needs and far exceeded our expectations. Having the entire Inn to ourselves allowed our friends and family to relax and celebrate together in comfort all weekend. We had about 100 guests, with nearly half staying on-site and the rest in great nearby accommodations. ☘️ Red Clover Inn is a hidden gem nestled in the Green Mountains near Killington. The setting is picture-perfect — beautiful grounds filled with colorful flowers and mountain views in every direction. The Inn offers a variety of accommodations to suit every need: the 10-person Farmhouse was ideal for the wedding party, with all the amenities of home; the Carriage House suites were luxurious and full of character; and the cozy Inn rooms were charming and comfortable. The interiors blend rustic elegance with modern comfort, and there are inviting living spaces throughout the main Inn where guests can gather and unwind. ☘️ Venetia was wonderful to work with and helped bring our vision to life throughout the planning process. Her many great ideas, excellent vendor recommendations, and thoughtful, special touches made the entire weekend feel beautifully curated and deeply personal. The staff was professional, friendly, and worked tirelessly to ensure every guest felt comfortable and cared for. ☘️ Venetia and the RCI team made the rehearsal BBQ dinner magical. It was set under the apple tree with stunning tablescapes, gorgeous flowers, candles, and twinkle lights. Guests enjoyed lawn games, relaxing and socializing in the cozy common rooms, and ending the evening around the grand fire pit with s’mores and drinks thoughtfully provided by Venetia and her team. ☘️ For the wedding day, Venetia and her team transformed the stunning ceremony space by the pond into a dreamy, elegant, rustic setting with a beautiful huppah. The RCI team worked closely with our amazing caterer, Cloud 9 Caterers, for set-up and seamless execution. The cocktail hour and reception tent were perfectly arranged, and the entire evening was fantastic — from dining and dancing to the sparkler send-off and lively after party in the Inn. The weekend concluded with a delicious breakfast featuring amazing service and the most scrumptious apple turnovers (our guests are still raving about them!). ☘️ We are forever grateful to Venetia, Mark, and the entire Red Clover Inn team for creating such a joyful and unforgettable wedding celebration. Many guests told us it was the best wedding they had ever attended. The Red Clover Inn is a truly magical place that exceeds every expectation and embodies the very best of Vermont hospitality. We cannot recommend it highly enough — they will make your event extraordinary. 💕
