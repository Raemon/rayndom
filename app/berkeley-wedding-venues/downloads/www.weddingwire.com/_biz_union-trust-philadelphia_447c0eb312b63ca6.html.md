Union Trust is highly recommended 

Union Trust, managed by Finley Catering was amazing. Our son's wedding was held there in September 2025. The food was delicious, the venue was beautiful and we received many compliments from our guests. Thomas, the wedding coordinator was very organized and made the day less stressful. He had a great sense of humor, while making sure all the details were addressed. Micel, the bride/groom attendant was so lovely and helpful. Diane, one of the servers went out of her way to help and was very attentive. EVERY employee exhibited a level of service and professionalism that blew us away. Even the mother of the owner, Carol came to the venue on the day of the wedding to check in and make sure we had everything we needed. What business, especially in the wedding industry, does that these days? The day turned out beautifully and was everything the bride and groom hoped it would be. We left with happy and positive memories of our children's wedding day.

Union Trust: Exceeded Every Expectation

After hearing great things about Finley Catering and Union Trust, we had high expectations for our wedding venue, and Union Trust exceeded them in every way! From our very first meeting with Chelsea, we knew we'd found the right fit. She was an absolute joy to work with throughout the entire planning process – incredibly helpful with great suggestions and guidance, kind, professional, always quick to communicate, and genuinely made every step of planning stress-free and fun.   
  
As our wedding day approached, Thomas, our Maitre D', stepped in to expertly guide us. His vast experience and invaluable suggestions truly helped us maximize every moment of our ceremony and reception. And the wedding day itself? It was flawless, completely surpassing all expectations for us and our guests.   
  
The entire Union Trust team is seriously top-notch. Chelsea, Thomas, our amazing wedding attendant Robin, fantastic bartenders Chris and Rich, and every crew member supporting the event worked seamlessly. Our guests are still raving about the exceptional quality and incredible expansiveness of the food and drinks, as well as the impeccable service. It felt like they anticipated our every need – we never had to ask for a single thing; Chelsea, Thomas, or Robin were there with it in hand before we even realized we needed it.   
  
Leaving that night, not only were we married, but we were hugging the staff and felt like we'd made new friends – an experience truly unique from any other wedding we've attended. This is the ultimate testament to how extraordinary the staff at Union Trust truly is. If you're looking for a venue that delivers on every promise and then some, Union Trust is it!

Amazing venue!

We got married at Union Trust in May 2024 and had the most amazing time! Everything about the venue was perfect, from the staff and customer service to the food and drink and everything in between. Guests are still raving about how stunning the space is and how great the food was. Brooke, Thomas and the whole team at Finley Catering go above and beyond to make the day extraordinary!

Best wedding day ever!

I just had my wedding here in 7/14/2024. This venue went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing day! Brooke especially did an amazing job with helping us plan our special day and was always extremely responsive and kind! I wish I could relive the day over and over again. Our food was amazing and all the guests wouldn’t stop raving about how phenomenal the food and service was! The guests all danced and had an amazing time! The bridal suite was perfect for getting ready in! I had the best wedding day ever!

Best Decision Ever 

I cannot say enough good things about Union Trust and the Finley Catering team. From start to finish, they were nothing short of excellent and accommodating. Their responsiveness and their willingness to make our wedding day the most special it could be was nothing short of excellent. Our guests could not stop talking about the venue, the food, the service, it truly was a top tier experience and would recommend them every time!

The perfect venue - we wouldn't have changed a thing!

We got married at Union Trust last weekend, and we had the most wonderful experience with them and are so happy with our decision. We did our ceremony there as well as our cocktail hour and reception. We also utilized the Bridal Suite to get ready throughout the morning. Stephanie was our coordinator, and she was great. Extremely organized and helped with all of our questions and needs. Thomas helps run the show week of/day of, and he was 100% on top of everything. We did not have a wedding planner, and I didn't feel like I needed one because Finley Catering/Union Trust really handles everything for you. We didn't do an after party there, but we did opt in for the snacks at the end (pretzels and Insomnia Cookies), and that was a great decision. Also, they wrap extra cake up for guests to take on their way out, which was a nice touch. So many of our guests raved over the food and the level of service they received throughout the night, and Lisa and Tracey who helped me in the Bridal Suite all day were amazing. I honestly don't know if there are words that can adequately express how grateful we are for Finley's help and leadership in making it a perfect wedding. We are so happy that we decided to have our wedding celebration at Union Trust, and we really couldn't have asked for the day to have gone any better.

A Dream Venue with Exceptional Service and Unforgettable Experiences

Union Trust was our dream venue. On our initial visit, we were greeted by Emily Hassinger, a perfect human and representative to the company. She was knowledgeable about everything Union Trust had to offer, was down to earth, and her energy radiated! She made it easy for us to see us celebrating the biggest moment in our lives with them. After the walkthrough, we spoke about costs and the Finley package. She spoke to us about everything that was included, all the different food and drink options, and gave us lists for vendors. We also went through a detailed list of upgrades that we could add onto our base package to make the event more specified to our wants. One of the biggest things that set Union Trust apart was their all inclusive price, which included tax and tips. When looking at other venues, their "per person" cost did not include any of these fees which quickly set Finley to the top in our eyes.  
  
With Finley, we were able to enjoy a free group tasting with other people getting married at Union Trust. This allowed us to talk to others about what they were planning on doing at the same venue. The food at the tasting was phenomenal and they allowed you to try a LOT of food! At this event, we could see how all the upgrades looked in person, instead of mere pictures. Our favorite upgrade which was the basis for our whole theme was their beautiful white dance floor with gold stripes. We immediately put that on our want list and all of our decor and conversations with vendors quickly shifted. We loved that Finley had a collaboration with The Master's Baker, which provided a free 4 tier cake as part of the package.   
  
When we walked into the venue the day of the wedding, every bit of planning we did was worth it. Without Emily and Thomas, our maitre'd, I don't know how the event would have turned out. They met with us about 3 times before the wedding happened (not including the 573 emails sent through the process) to ensure that everything we wanted and changed in contracts was followed through on, collected all of our decor and supplies for the wedding, and then accurately set it up exactly as we had envisioned! They were amiable to all of our vendors and had the event running like a well-oiled machine.  
  
The staff there that night made us feel like kings and had everything moving in a timely manner. Our main server ensured that we were happy, got enough food from the cocktail hour, served us beverages, and checked in on us often to make sure we were well hydrated and fed so we didn't get too sloppy! She also made sure that our parents were taken care of! We also had another server who made it her personal goal to ensure that my Nan & Pop (and yes, she called them Nan & Pop) were treated like gold. She would bring them food at cocktail hour so they didn't have to move around, grab them drinks, and even packed food to go when they didn't want to eat at the moment. The staff made sure to enjoy themselves through the course of the night: we saw them bopping to the songs, singing out loud, and when we pulled them to the dance floor they made sure to cut a rug! All of these little things meant everything to us!  
  
We could not have been blessed with a better venue. We had always been told that on your day, something WILL go wrong and will not be as you planned. With Union Trust leading the way, we can honestly say that our wedding was perfectly executed.

10/10 recommend 

UT was a dream! Absolutely wonderful people to work with and they make it really easy for you as well. Daria, the coordinator I worked with was very responsive and helpful, probably to a point past her job description but of course she built so much trust and it was so easy to just put my faith in this team and let everything play out stress free! And of course EVERYTHING played out perfectly, they are a well-oiled machine.  
  
Aside from the back end component, the food was so good (hearing that over and over from guests), staff was extremely efficient in service (bar, tableside, etc) and of course the space is so stunning. So glad we went with this venue and team!

Absolute perfection.

I wish I could provide a higher rating than 5 stars. Not to be cheesy, but they simply ARE the best. We booked at Finley because of their reputation of hospitality and food. But they exceeded our expectations. From the beginning, the planning process was seamless and Daria was the greatest at answering all our questions. We had the ceremony and afterparty at the venue space as well and it was amazing how well everything was run. As the bride, I was overwhelmed with planning a wedding. However, my mind was at ease knowing that Finley takes care of everything. After our final meeting with our day of coordinator, Thomas, I went into the day so calm. The venue was breathtaking and we loved that we utilized the levels for the ceremony and reception entrance. Everything was absolutely perfect. Lisa was the day-of attendant and she was wonderful. She helped me calm myself before walking down the aisle, and was there all night making sure I had everything that I needed. Our guests were blown away by everything – the venue, the sparklers, and the food. There was so much food for cocktail hour, dinner was restaurant-quality, and the dessert bar was a huge hit. I can’t wait to attend a Finley venue as a guest and be able to enjoy their perfection again!

Truly incredible! 

Michelle, Thomas and the team at Union Trust / Finley was so incredible to work with from the day we toured to our wedding night. They didn’t skip a beat. The place is unbelievable. The level of service is truly exceptional and the food is incredible. Our expectations were so far exceeded and everything was truly perfect. By far the best decision we made going with Finley and Union Trust for our wedding!! You will be in the BEST hands!
