They were incredibly easy to work with and made our wedding and reception wonderful. They allowed us to get in and decorate the day before and the rehearsal dinner was fabulous. The day of the wedding they were gracious with everything they provided while we got ready, and offered a great set of spaces for prep and relaxation between the ceremony and reception. There are some beautiful places on-site for photos. The reception itself was magical and many of our guests complimented us on the food. I would highly recommend them to anyone.

Marvin and the Des Moines Botanical Garden staff made our little wedding perfect. We were most grateful for Marvin's expertise and insight as to what would work best, from set-up to the ceremony to the reception. He listened to what we wanted and made it happen. The staff were exceptional, friendly, and helpful. I'm still getting compliments on how delicious the food was (catered by Trellis) and how beautiful the garden was (the DMBG Horticulture Team is brilliant!) I am/was an older bride with no real intention of having a wedding. I thought we were courthouse-bound, but I'm so glad we had a wedding and at my favorite place. It was perfection.

We used this area for our ceremony AND reception, and it was fabulous! They were super nice, very communicative, and helped us plan every step of the way. They were very flexible with us as well. During the event, they were professional but also very fun and fit right in to our atmosphere. I would highly recommend them for anything!

Offshore Venue was perfect for our daughters wedding. Emily was AMAZING to work with, she was very professional, got back to me with all of my questions in a timely manner. Overlooking the Mississippi River was perfect spot for the wedding. Highly recommend the Event Center. The Hotel is a different story, they need some help getting organized and working on the customer service. When we had questions we always felt that it was such an inconvenience for the front desk to answer or to find the answer. They seem to cater more to the Resort more than the wedding guest.
