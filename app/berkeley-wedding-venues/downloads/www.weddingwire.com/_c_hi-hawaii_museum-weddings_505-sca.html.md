The historic Pacific Aviation Museum was a perfect place to hold my reception. With the beautiful ostrich/peacock centerpieces placed on the peacock blue tables placed throughout the museum along with the WWII war planes and history all over the museum made my event so unique. thank you to April and the staff at the Pacific Aviation Museum for having us there and being so wonderful. Aloha, Tracy Fermin-Bras

We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here and was very pleased with the service and accommodations. We had about 30 people attend and were able to eat a wonderful buffet dinner! The space was just enough for dinner and the rehearsal. Communication is also a plus, no problems!

Our wedding turned out beautiful! Scott was very accommodating and hospitable! Even if there was another large event happening on the same day, the courtyard and sculpture garden was ready for us. All my guests were super impressed. If I could only do it again! Thank you HISAM!

The aquarium's outdoor lawn makes for a lovely venue. The ocean backdrop is particularly nice at sunset. As long as you read the contract carefully regarding the rules (mostly to protect the animals), it's a great affordable venue.
