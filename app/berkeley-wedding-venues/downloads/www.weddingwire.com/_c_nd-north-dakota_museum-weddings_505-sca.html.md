Right in the heart of downtown Fargo, the Plains Art Museum is a stunning venue that has everything you need for a beautiful wedding. We got married in May 2023 and had our reception here, and it made all our dreams come true! With beautiful architecture it really helps you save on decorating costs because you really want to showcase everything the building already has to offer. We had our dinner and speeches up on the 3rd floor and dancing on the 1st floor - we personally loved this separation because it kept everyone together and close, and it helped getting people dancing through the whole night! Serena was a breeze to work with, fantastic communication - prompt, friendly, informative & was very present - she made sure to check in any time we were there and was ready to answer any & all questions! Book your wedding here, you won't regret it :)

Absolutely wonderful venue for a casual outdoor wedding ceremony. We had our reception elsewhere but the ceremony was beautiful. The staff was extremely flexible and attentive before and during our wedding. We took most of our photos at this location and they have many gorgeous and fun spots for all wedding photos. We also opted for a camel feeding after the ceremony for guests. Very fun wedding venue and I would recommend to everyone!

The Fargo Air Museum is the perfect place for a wedding. We had our ceremony in one hangar and the reception in the other. Very cheap, plenty of room, they provided tables, chairs and some linens. The staff were super helpful and our guests had a blast. I would recommend this unique space to anyone looking to save money on a venue.
