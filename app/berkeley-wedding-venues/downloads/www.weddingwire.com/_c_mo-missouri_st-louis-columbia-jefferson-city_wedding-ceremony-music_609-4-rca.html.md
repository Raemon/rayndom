Marilyn quickly responded and was a breeze to work with. We picked several favorites and she made helpful recommendations and asked questions so it was all planned. The musicians were outstanding, on time, did their thing, and made for an elegant touch to the most special day. We would book them again!

I'm no expert in the wedding industry, but David handled everything which made my life so easy! He has great examples on his website of song recommendations and past venues he's played at. I booked online, filled out his music form and that was it. I didn't have to coordinate anything else and all the guests loved him. Our wedding was at the Sheldon so the live piano was perfect for the ceremony

The Guitar Duo performed at my outdoor wedding and their beautiful playing exceeded our expectations! Prior to the wedding they were incredibly and quickly responsive to any email or questions we had. They even played two songs that weren’t on their list but that we really wanted played at our ceremony. They were also very kind to talk to. Would recommend to anyone wanting a beautiful addition to their event!

Abbey was AMAZING at helping make our days special! My husband and I actually had two weddings - One traditional Catholic wedding (my family) and one non-traditional (my husband's) and I didn't know what to look for for either of them. But Abbey walked us through every step of the way, and somehow knew exactly what music would work for each. She was so helpful and responsive to every question I had. We couldn't have gotten through it without her - highly, highly recommend!!

We booked Sonja for my son's wedding this past December. The booking process was super easy and Sonja responded quickly and stayed in touch periodically up to the wedding date. Every song my son and daughter-in-law asked for was available for Sonja to perform at the wedding. The wedding was small and intimate and the harp was the perfect selection to set the tone. The day turned out perfect. I highly recommend Sonja!

Definitely I´d book this group again. They were so professional and nice, I could choose all the songs I wanted (even some tricky ones...) and their performance was superb. You can tell they have lots of experience and they managed the timing perfectly. Fantastic wedding!

We hired Nigel, from Steel Drum Flavor, for our wedding ceremony and cocktail hour. We met him at a bridal show downtown. Our guest can’t stop talking about how amazing and energetic he was during the wedding. We hirely recommend Nigel to any one looking to have the experience of their lifetime.
