Caroline did a great job of making the day easy for me! Rhodes Hall is absolutely gorgeous. I loved that I did not feel the need to add any decorations to the inside of the venue. I forgot to bring the few artificial flowers that I planned to tie to a few seats outside for the ceremony. The yard is gorgeous too, so there really was no need for any decor there either. The venue is reasonably priced and worth even more because of great staff like Caroline.

I (Ms. Brendalyn Bailey) could not have asked for a more elegant experience for my sister’s wedding. The “Hillman” wedding (Mr. Izell B. Hillman and Ms. Beverly M. Bailey) was beautiful and fun. The rustic background of the “Blacksmith” downtown Macon facility was the impetus that gave this event its extraordinary appeal. Were the summer heat of the day, “we initially thought would be a problem”, the facility of the Blacksmith more than compensated by keeping everyone “COOL” and comfortable. Christopher Marcs Designs (Mr. Graddick) was the planner and designer of the ceremony. Mr. Graddick arranged the rehearsal for the wedding party, kept the commencements moving in an orderly fashion, and continually made sure that all members of the event had everything they needed during and after the ceremony. I salute his professionalism, as well as, his dedication to our family. A big “thank you”. Each family was able to be assigned a particular table. Mr. Graddick was able to check everyone into the main area while keeping the precessions secure. For my family, security was a principle concern. The Blacksmith’s gated facility definitely helped to keep the family safe as well as the small children that also attended. Michael Davis – (Personal Chef) SDR Personal Chef prepared the food for this event. Everything was delicious, hot and ready from the oven. I think it looked just as beautiful as it tasted. Mr. Davis was especially pleased with the commercial grade kitchen of the Blacksmith. There were many free surfaces available for food prep in addition to a large display area for the finish entrees, 2 convection ovens, 3 conventional ovens and multiple burners. “This made cooking a true delight”, said Mr. Davis. The band had its own area in front of the main entrance that was easily viewed by all guest. And the high ceilings of the Blacksmith provided the acoustics in the room that made the music rise and fall from the ceiling to the wall. The sound carried smoothly from room to room over the PA systems. Music was done by the natives of Macon: • Aj the DJ • Mr. Dean Brown • Mr. Harold Thomas We thank these artists for their collective contributions to this great day. The bridal suite and Groom’s man suite were centrally located in a perfect positon that allowed the wedding participants to have a private area away from guests. Both areas were separate and we could walk around without getting into each other’s way. I do encourage and highly recommend this venue “The Blacksmith” for weddings, parties, and any large gathering where attention to detail, infusion of culture where life time memories are made. The size of the space, lights that come on at night in the court yard, the bridal suite, prep space in the commercial kitchen, guest restrooms, Bar service area, and the gated exterior were just a few reasons I recommend this location in Downtown Macon. Mr. Alvin Bailey (father of the Bride) states: “It was the nicest event” .. I feel like the most blessed man in the world. This completes the things that I have most wanted for my life and my children. A few things that made this event extra special for me was: the fact that it was inside of the city of Macon. I didn’t need to travel miles to get this event completed, and there was enough room for everyone to be comfortable – and they really treated us nice.

My husband and I got married in October of 2025 and we are so happy that we got married at the Historic Dekalb Courthouse. It was so beautiful and perfect. Mallory was amazing and went above and beyond to help us. The courthouse is a perfect place to get married. The outside and inside are stunning and the perfect backdrop for photos. We love Decatur and this was the best venue ever for us.

If you're looking for the perfect place to say "I do," stop searching—you HAVE to get married here! From the moment we booked, the team was nothing short of amazing. Their professionalism, attention to detail, and genuine care made the entire process seamless. As a bride, I felt completely supported every step of the way—they truly held my hand through the entire experience. The venue itself is stunning, creating the most magical backdrop for our special day. Every detail, from the breathtaking setup to the impeccable service, exceeded our expectations. Our guests were in awe, and we couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful or stress-free experience. If you want a wedding venue that goes above and beyond to make your day unforgettable, look no further. I would choose this venue a thousand times over!

The Trolley Barn was the perfect place to host our wedding. Great outdoor and indoor spaces, beautiful and historic grounds, easy to get to from all over town. Lisa was very supportive and flexible, as we had to postpone once due to the pandemic. It was so nice that we felt supported during that very uncertain and scary time. Our guests are still raving about how beautiful everything was, and the pictures turned out amazing. One thing I really appreciate the most about The Trolley Barn is that it comes with so many different types of tables and chairs. We used a lot of what they provided (which saved a ton of money), but dressed up a few other aspects that we wanted to splurge on (like rectangular tables for dinner and black chairs for the ceremony and dinner). Highly recommend you consider this historic venue to give your guests a taste of a time gone by in the middle of the city!

From the first tour of Kimball Hall, it was clear that this was the perfect place to get married. The big, bright, historic house in Downtown Roswell matched my vision perfectly. The staff were attentive and professional, and made sure everyone was happy and well taken care of on our wedding day. The food and drinks from their in-house catering company, Southern Charmed, were amazing. And the entire venue is just stunning in every way, with so many amazing photo opportunities. But without a doubt, the best investment we made for our wedding was hiring a wedding coordinator. We decided to hire one through the venue and we absolutely lucked out with the best of the best, Leslie Boyd! She made everything feel effortless, was so thorough, timely and professional that I felt truly comfortable to relax and know that everything would still go off without a hitch…and it absolutely did!! I truly cannot say enough wonderful things about her. The entire team at Kimball Hall is appreciated for their hard work and for making our wedding day the most special day of our lives. If you're a couple looking for a beautiful, stress-free, and unforgettable wedding experience, look no further!

Our wedding experience with the Forsyth Park Inn was absolutely perfect! From the moment we stepped in the door, everything was smooth and wonderful. Our room was beautiful, with a view of the park, and the staff was super helpful with taking our bags up. Gary gave us a tour of the inn, showing us the veranda and the parlor, where refreshments were served. Everyone was super accommodating of my wife’s dairy allergy too, with our daily breakfast, wedding cake, and chocolate covered strawberries! Bobbie Jo, the inn’s wedding planner, was amazing! She is kind, professional, and had the entire day go without a hitch. The rehearsal the afternoon before was super informative and easy to follow. Even before we arrived at the Inn, Bobbie Jo made sure we had answers to all our questions, even ones we hadn’t thought to ask. The actual wedding day was everything I could have dreamed. Thanks to the list of vendors the Inn sent me, picking a hair & make-up artist and wedding photographer was a breeze. Our room was spacious enough for my whole family to have lunch and get ready. The Inn also did a great job in keeping my wife and I separated until the ceremony for the before pictures. The Inn is so beautiful, the ceremony and pictures are stunning! The garden courtyard was perfect, with the rose petal trail leading in. All of the details were taken care of for us, included in our package, such as the flowers, cake, Bobbie Jo herself, and the pastor marrying us. Even after the ceremony, when we returned to the inn after dinner, we had champagne, flutes, and chocolate covered strawberries delivered to our room. Every part of this experience truly helped create the wedding I’ve dream of my whole life and elevated it beyond anything I could have imagined! I highly recommend having your wedding at the Forsyth Park Inn; we cannot wait to stay there again! PS they’re also queer friendly.
