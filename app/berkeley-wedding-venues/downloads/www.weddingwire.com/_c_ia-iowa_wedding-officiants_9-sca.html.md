We can’t thank Rev. Martha Bautista of Aligned Hearts and Vows, LLC enough for making our wedding day so special. From the start, she was incredibly warm, friendly, and professional, and she never batted an eye at our somewhat unusual request to hold a tiny ceremony at the Ankeny Public Library with just us and our immediate family. She handled every detail with kindness and understanding, creating a ceremony that felt intimate, joyful, and perfectly “us.” Her calm presence and thoughtful words made the day feel effortless and unforgettable. If you’re looking for someone who is both accommodating and genuinely caring, Rev. Martha Bautista is absolutely wonderful. We are so grateful for her help in making our unique celebration everything we hoped it would be.

Rev. Mark Hall did our wedding ceremony vows. Prior to the wedding, he gets to know us through a phone call, and then gave us a few examples of vows to choose from, or use our own. On our wedding day, despite the rain and people coming late, he was very flexible to adapt to the schedule, etc. A pleasure to work with! Thank you!

Reverend James went above and beyond for us. He helped to choreograph the wedding. Everything was perfectly mapped out and went smooth. We also loved how he added some humor to the ceremony and kept the mood light. Would definitely recommend him!

We are so happy that we chose Jamie to officiate our wedding. From the beginning she was professional, kind and listened to what we wanted. We met with her once in person and then communicated over email from there. She provided us a template to give us a starting point for our ceremony readings and was very responsive to our additional questions. We made changes to our ceremony readings up until the week of our wedding. On the day of our wedding Jamie arrived dressed nicely and the ceremony went just how we expected! I would definitely recommend Jamie!

Dustin was the perfect officiant for our wedding! We were planning our wedding from AZ and having it in WA. It was hard because we are both Christian and were looking for a pastor to officiate our wedding, and the one we first asked said he would not do it bc we weren't members of "his church". Luckily my mother found Pastor Dustin online. He was able to meet us the week before the wedding after we flew in so that he could get a feel for what we wanted and he REALLY listened to what we were looking for in a ceremony. Pastor Dustin kept it fun while really highlighting our love for each other and we could not have asked, or prayed for, a better person to marry us! My (now) husband and I would recommend him to anyone looking for an officiant in the greater Seattle area! THANK YOU PASTOR DUSTIN! You were a "God-send".... :)

Brent.... You truley were a dream to work with. Even around mine and Dan's busy college schedules we still managed to workout a time to complete the three marriage sessions that were required of us. I felt the rehearsal went off without a hitch and the wedding, eventhough, I was beyond nervous was great. Like you said you may get up there and want to go hide, but go through with it. You two have weathered the trials and tribulations as well as any couple. Thank You!
