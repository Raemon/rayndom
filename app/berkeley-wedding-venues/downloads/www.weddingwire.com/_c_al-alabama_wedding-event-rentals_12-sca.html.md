All Needz went above and beyond to make our wedding reception GORGEOUS! We used them for all of our tables, linens, table arrangements, and majority of our china needs. They worked with our wedding planner to develop a comprehensive list. And when there was specific items not in their collection, they make sure to find them. (I specifically requested gold candelabras) Everyone we worked with was delightful and so helpful! They were patient with us when we encountered revisions and executed our day flawlessly! Thank you so much to everyone at All Needz for making our day look beautiful!

American Tent & Rental was great! We rented most of our stuff from them (napkins, wine glasses, pipe and drape, chargers, chairs) and they were good to work with. Their shop is a little cluttered but really that's no big deal; you can still find whatever you need and the staff is happy to help. Plus, you can't beat their prices!! I would give them 6 stars for value if I could. We also put in a very last minute order for some pipe and drape for the stage at our venue and it wasn't a problem for them. I would recommend them for sure!

Jackie was so easy to work with! I went out to her barn/warehouse and was able to pick out items that I wanted. Her barn is SO well organized! It was very easy to see everything. I told her that I wanted everything green and anything that she didn't already have, she was able to search for prior to the wedding. Ohmygoodness!!! The church where we got married was decorated so well! It was EXACTLY what I wanted! Jackie and her team did an outstanding job and have such an attention to detail!

Top Notch was very affordable when I went to pick out linens for our wedding reception. They were very easy to work with and dropped off the linens the day of the wedding at my venue. My mother-in-law took our linens back Monday morning since we had only reserved our venue space for Friday and Saturday. I would highly recommend them to spruce up any party tables!
