I had the absolute pleasure of having Jezmina at our wedding, and I cannot express how incredible the experience was. From the moment she arrived, she brought such warmth and positivity, it instantly put our guests at ease. Jezmina is a generational fortune teller, and it shows. Everyone was blown away by the accuracy of their readings! Guests loved her ability to connect with them on a personal level, with many remarking how her insights resonated deeply with their own lives. Communication with Jezmina was very easy and clear. She was responsive, flexible and easy to work with, seamlessly integrating into our wedding plans. I can honestly say that booking Jezmina was the easiest part of organizing the whole wedding! She adapted to our timeline and made sure that everyone who wanted a reading on the day had the opportunity. If you're looking for a fortune teller who combines skill, warmth, and a genuine passion for what they do, book Jezmina. Jezmina made our special day that much more special! She is worth every cent.

Matt was absolutely amazing to work with at Match Sticks! We booked him less than two months before our wedding, and he was incredibly accommodating and professional throughout the entire process. We’re so grateful we were able to secure him. The cigar bar ended up being a huge hit with our guests. Before the wedding, we met with Matt for about an hour, and he was so thoughtful in the questions he asked, taking the time to really get to know our story. On the big day, he surprised us with a curated selection of cigars that each had a special connection to me and my husband. He explained the significance of each one to us and our guests, which made the experience even more meaningful. We can’t recommend Match Sticks enough for any wedding or special event. It was such a unique and memorable touch that our guests are still talking about!

As a wedding planner in the Boston market, I've known Jennifer for MANY years and have worked with her many times! However, recently I had the pleasure of working with Jen on a project for my own wedding. I gave Jen a few photos of my English Bulldog, Brady, and asked her to make some "Brady Cookies" for the wedding welcome bags. THEY CAME OUT PERFECT! Our guests absolutely loved them! They were the perfect surprise treat to set the tone for our weekend and Jen made it all SO EASY. Not only is she unbelievably talented but she makes the entire process so simple. I am very grateful to know and work with such a wonderful professional and could not recommend her more! THANK YOU JEN!

I've known the owner of Kaylee's Candles for over 10 years. I'm familiar with her work well as I've seen it at two other weddings. This is why I wanted her champagne flute favors/escort cards for my wedding. I like to support small businesses when ever possible and I knew that the size of her operation wouldn't take away from the quality of her work. The candles set up on the table looked like a champagne toast -- glittered and sparkled as if caught in time. What a great keepsake to take home!

I ordered heart-shaped sparklers and thank-you cards from Yacanna.com. When they shipped separately and I called to make sure the sparklers were still coming, I received a response immediately during business hours to confirm that it would be arriving the next day. Very prompt, good deal and the quality is just as expected.

I ordered biodegradable eco-confetti from this company and it was perfect. All you had to do was hose off the pavement and it is gone. We were short a bag of confetti and I ordered it only a few days before the wedding, and they got it to me on time with no extra cost.

We had the chocolate raspberry mousse cake for our wedding as we do not like traditional cake with frosting. It was absolutely delicious and we look forward to thawing the leftovers out on our anniversary. The cake was reasonably priced and the staff extremely helpful. Thank you!

I ordered all of my announcments and invitations through this wonderful store. They have a huge selection of invitations to choose from and are very helpful when designing or coming up with custom notecards, etc. The service is also very promt. Even if you cannot visit the store you can order everything over the phone and they are very quick in getting a proof to you.

Gail painted not one but TWO paintings of our wedding; the first was live, a gift for my parents, while the second was from a different perspective, painted after the wedding using photos that we provided. This second painting was a gift for my groom's parents. Both sets LOVED the paintings, but I think more importantly, having a "wow factor" at the wedding - a painter capturing the event while it was taking place - was huge. Everyone loved it, and by the end of the night, you could really see where the painting was going. This was a unique way to thank our parents for their support AND add a very cool element to our wedding. I would highly recommend!
