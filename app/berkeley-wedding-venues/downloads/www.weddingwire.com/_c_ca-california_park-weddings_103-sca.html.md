The day I found Wedgewood was a day in the stars for my husband and me. From the first meeting, I felt listened to, cared for, and experienced a level of dedication, genuineness, and above-and-beyond quality for an unbeatable price. I love your company, and your team, and my day was perfect. I cannot recommend and thank you enough!

We cannot say enough good things about the San Diego Safari Park team. They were SO incredibly kind and helpful from start to finish. They made sure we were well taken care of on the big day, from everything from making sure we got enough food to ensuring both brides had a dressing room available! Even with the uniqueness of the venue, they made everything so simple, like coordinating vendors, seating and accommodating all of the guests, the fine logistics, and clearly laying out the best options for us for everything little thing. The team was so kind and understanding with all of our questions and they were always quick to reply (we had so many!) We were married at Kijami in late September and the venue itself is absolutely stunning. We loved the natural beauty of it, meaning we didn't need to dress it up much with florals or other decor. Having a space for the dance floor and music and a quiet space where guests could take in the view and the animals was also amazing, as it allowed us to enjoy the night however we wanted! We loved that we found a space that was still unique without having to sacrifice any elegance that we wanted. We ended up with about 100 guests at our event and this venue was a great size for that. It allowed for people to mingle without being cramped, but the space still looked full. We can't thank Alyssa, Emily, and their team enough. Our day was absolutely perfect and we cannot recommend celebrating your wedding here enough. We really look forward to visiting the zoo again soon and continuing to make wonderful memories!

We hosted our wedding at Wolf Lakes Park and it was fantastic. During our planning process we must have toured over 50 venues. Of all those we chose Wolf Lakes Park -- and it didn't disappoint. The setting, the details, the food, the professionalism, the value -- all were there in spades. The day-of coordinator Rebecca and her team were extremely helpful, arranging our ceremony and coordinating the schedule and vendors. The food was delicious, with thoughtful accommodations for our gluten-free and vegetarian guests (some of our guests said this was the best pasta they'd had). Their list of vendors helped us greatly in the planning process. And on the day there were plenty of staff, including security and servers, to make sure everything went smoothly. The extras -- like the complementary boat rides, were a great add-on for our guests. There were no troubles accommodating the few things we decided to add: a photo booth, some lawn games. The venue itself looked spectacular, with the flowers in full bloom. The open house in April was extremely helpful in making our decisions on food and linens, and all throughout the planning process Janice and her team were responsive and helpful. After having seen many different venues, with varied offerings, we thought the value was hard to beat. We really couldn't have asked for more in a venue, and we would highly recommend it to anyone planning an event in future.

We got married in late July at The Gardens at Heather Farm Park, and it was truly the most perfect day. This venue holds such a special place in our hearts. My husband asked me to be his girlfriend under the gazebo years ago, and later proposed under the same gazebo. Choosing to get married where it all began was a complete no-brainer. We had a ceremony-only wedding, and the gardens were absolutely breathtaking. Every flower was fully bloomed, the grounds were stunning, and the atmosphere felt magical. So many of our guests, especially those visiting from outside Walnut Creek and neighboring cities, could not stop complimenting the venue. Many even took time to wander the gardens and take their own photos because it was just that beautiful. I cannot say enough good things about Cathleen and the entire GHF team. They were incredible to work with and made everything feel seamless and stress-free. The weather was perfect, the venue was perfect, and honestly, everything was perfect. It was truly the best day of my life, and I will forever be grateful that we were able to say I do in such a meaningful and beautiful place.

Nestldown is truly the most magical place. Not only is it physically beautiful with the scenery, but there is a real sense of magic in the air that makes you feel like you’re in a fairytale. My husband and I toured Nestldown shortly after getting engaged, and didn’t need to tour any other venue after because we knew it was the one. We booked a minimony due to wanting a very intimate ceremony of 20 guests and it was absolutely perfect. We were so lucky to have Diana as our SEM, and she is a rockstar!! Her communication was consistent and she was always friendly and responded to questions quickly. Nestldown knows how to run any event seamlessly, and Diana ensured our day was absolutely perfect and ran smoother than I could have dreamed of! My only concern with a minimony was that it might feel rushed due to a shorter rental timeframe, but it couldn’t be further from the truth. It was the perfect length to have a first look, a 30 minute ceremony, family photos, additional photos of just the bride and groom, and all the special moments such as toasts and a Father of the Bride dance! Our guests and I felt it was a smooth schedule with ample time to socialize and take candid photos in the reception area! No one felt rushed at all and just kept commenting on how beautiful the venue was and how amazing Diana was! Diana not only made sure our wedding day was perfect and ran smoothly, but she also made our families feel special and cared for! She helped our family members with accessibility issues get to all areas of the wedding events and went above and beyond to make sure they were comfortable. All of the staff at Nestldown were friendly and helpful during our event as well as any time we visited for the planning process. We seriously cannot say enough wonderful things about Nestldown, Diana, and the team. It was the most perfect day and we are so grateful for everyone who helped give us live out our fairytale moment!

The LA Arboretum was undoubtedly the perfect place for our wedding, not just because of its natural beauty, but because of the amazing people behind the scenes who worked to bring our special day to life. Carlos, Ronny, Michael, Nadia, and so many more worked tirelessly for months prior to our wedding putting us so at ease at every step of the way. They were prompt, attentive, and their genuine care and support for us was always evident. On the day of the wedding, they made sure everything ran so smoothly, taking care of almost all rentals and setup matters to perfectly match our vision for the day. They crafted a custom wedding menu for us which all of our guests absolutely raved about (and many have since asked if they can get the recipes). They were consistently so warm and giving, and we could not have been happier. It helps that the Arboretum itself is so stunning at every step, from our ceremony to reception, and for all the myriad photo stops along the way. We highly recommend the Arboretum to any and all, and are eager to walk the gardens again to relive the joy of that day, and to appreciate the immense work that the Arboretum staff did to help realize it.

We reserved Hastings House for our wedding in early November 2024. It was a fantastic event thanks to Linda and her leadership, her marvelous garden, and the ambiance created by her husband Richard and his guitar. We got lucky with a gorgeous sunny day that brought out the best lighting for the garden ceremony and photos. Our family and friends were impressed with the whole experience. Linda helped us right from the start with a recommendation list that included Dave Medal Photography, La Costanera for the reception and Alena Jean for our florals. The few months of preparation and the day of events could not have gone any better and we cannot recommend Linda and her garden enough.
