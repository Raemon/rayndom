BOOK REGATTA PLACE NOW!!! This is by far the most stunning venue for the price you’ll find in all of Newport. Maggie and Kay helped make our weekend absolutely perfect. From start to finish, they made everything effortless. The day before our wedding, they helped us plan a private boat tour around Newport—one of the biggest highlights of the entire weekend. The food was unforgettable. Think: a full lobster buffet, endless oysters, and a cocktail shrimp bar that wowed every guest. One of the most memorable moments was how they coordinated a water taxi for us and our bridal party to leave the venue in style, waving goodbye as we cruised straight to downtown Newport. It was such a unique and fun send-off. I highly recommend hiring a great band and photographer—those two things, paired with Regatta Place’s incredible team, made our day (and entire weekend) seamless. Maggie and Kay acted as our wedding coordinators, which meant we didn’t have to worry about a single thing. The venue itself is breathtaking, with so much natural beauty, and the layout allows guests to move around freely rather than being stuck at their tables. Our ceremony on the dock was magical—everything we hoped for and more. We truly can’t say enough good things. If you’re considering Regatta Place, don’t wait. Book it!
