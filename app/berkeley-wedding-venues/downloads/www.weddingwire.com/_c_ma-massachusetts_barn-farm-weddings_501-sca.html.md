We had our wedding at The Barn at Gibbet Hill in May 2025. I can honestly say it was the perfect day. The venue is so beautiful on its own, but the venue staff really make for a wonderful experience. Our wedding coordinator made sure our day went without a hitch from our very first planning meeting. We had our ceremony outside that overlooks the grounds. Our guests had plenty of space on the four season porch for cocktail hour. Our guests continue to rave about the food! I can honestly say I wouldn't have changed a thing about our wedding day.

If I could give 1,000 stars I would. I don’t even know where to start because from day 1 Harrington Farm has been so incredible to work with. We started this journey meeting with Lauryn for a virtual tour and fell in love with the beauty and charm that Harrington had to offer. Every single step of the way, Lauryn was there- not only handling the typical contract/details/etc but always there to give advice/ideas or answer one of my million questions. The wedding day itself was PERFECT. I didn’t have to worry about one thing. They are so organized and have plenty of staff to keep things smooth. The food and drinks are incredible. The venue is breathtaking and unique. Outside- there are so many beautiful and different spots on the property, which is amazing for photos! The cocktail hour tent feels like you’re at home on a patio, in a good way. Inside- the reception room is gorgeous with the high ceilings and beams, and the farmhouse is so charming and beautiful to get ready in. Harrington Farm also has many decor items, saving brides to be so much time. I had five signs, table numbers, and black lantern centerpieces! There was more but those were the big ones. They included linens and chargers and all that as well. I just can’t say enough great things about Harrington Farm. Every single thing from start to finish was beyond amazing. Even the day after- Lauryn helped pack my trunk up with the things I brought! This was an incredible experience and I’m so grateful. Photos courtesy of Dolen Photo

All of the staff at the Red Lion were incredibly accommodating, from the front desk to our amazing coordinator, Samantha. They exceeded every expectation and truly made our wedding day a dream. We loved it so much that we stayed again a year later, and we’re so grateful we chose the Red Lion so we can continue coming back to celebrate our anniversaries in a place that means so much to us. \- Laura & Cait McDonough

QuonQuont was the perfect place for us to say our "I do's". The location is secluded enough that you feel you are in the middle of the country but is central enough that people are able to travel to and from without getting lost. The service day of was amazing and the coordinators were helpful & knowledgable. A great place to have you perfect day.

The team at Gedney Farm was wonderful from the moment we toured for the first time through the last song. Their food is spectacular and their whole team went above and beyond to make sure our day was exactly what we wanted. Gedney is a lovely inn and restaurant located in the heart of the Berkshires, and the space is gorgeous - it can be as rustic or as modern as you want, and needs very little decoration to make it beautiful. They have a wonderful events coordinator, Samantha, that helps you through the entire process, making sure you meet deadlines and guiding you through the process of selecting food, reception configurations, location, and more. The sommelier and the chef were also wonderful. Our guests could not stop raving about the food. We were married outside during the summer and the cocktail reception was indoor/outdoor with the dinner and reception indoors upstairs. We also had a group of our friends stay with us onsite; there's plenty of room for hanging out in the inn itself. If you're like we were, you care a LOT about climate control, especially in summer and winter, so we were grateful that not only did we have good weather, but the venue is fully heated and air conditioned. We opted for the Argentine grill at the cocktail hour - you will NOT regret it (our guests are still raving about the ribs - a friend's husband had at least 5, and my own uncle pulled me aside at a family holiday party to specifically talk to me about them). The setting is magical and the photos reflect it. I fully endorse having your wedding at Gedney Farm. What a gem in The Berkshires!

I would say that one of the best things about having your wedding at Codman is that you really just need a very small flowers budget! the venue is so beautiful and charming that you really just need a few bud vases on tables and your bouquets! The site really adds so much natural beauty that adding lots of flowers would take away from its class and simplicity. The people that you deal with for any arrangements are extremely lovely, easy and they really do care about your event and want it to be special! don't hesitate to book your wedding here !!!

Laura and Fireside Catering made our wedding dreams come true! From the stunning venue to the amazing food, I cannot recommend the Estate at Moraine Farm enough. The three distinct spaces for the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception is really what sold the venue for me, along with the accommodating rain plan. The stunning teahouse, greenery and lake, along with the delicious wedding food were all the cherry on top! Laura was the best venue coordinator ever and I cannot say enough about how helpful she was while I navigated this process without a wedding planner. Our guests complimented us non-stop on the beauty of the venue and the quality of the food. Great food was an important aspect of our wedding to me, and I cannot be happier with how everything came out with Fireside Catering. We had a set budget and having our wedding at Moraine Farm was the best decision in terms of balancing finances and our vision for a gorgeous New England wedding. If you love outdoor venues, amazing food, and romantic, garden vibes, have your wedding at Moraine Farm!!

Smolak Farms was the perfect venue!!!! The apple orchard for the ceremony and the rustic feel in the reception area was better than we ever could have asked for. The wedding coordinator was most helpful, most caring, and most understanding person to work with throughout the whole process. She constantly reassured us over following year any time we were worried about a step in the process and she helped so much keep us on track in our planning. On top of that, her recommendations for vendors were perfect. She went above and beyond at every turn and we truly cannot express just how much we appreciated working with her. SHE IS AMAZING. On the day of the event, the wedding staff there were very communcative and kind. We loved working with all of them. The set-up inside of the reception area was soooo beautiful. The fire pit was such a nice addition for the kids too. We had a few add-ons too that were really nice, like the donut wall and ice cream from the venue, the staff arranging our flowers, etc. We could not recommend this venue enough. They made everything so much easier and so perfect for us. We love Smolak!!!!!!!!!!!
