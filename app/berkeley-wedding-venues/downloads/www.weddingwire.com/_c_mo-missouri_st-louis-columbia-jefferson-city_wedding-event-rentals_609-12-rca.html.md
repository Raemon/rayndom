As a business owner planning events, I work only with A-1 for any rental needs I have. I find their staff to be courteous, knowledgeable, patient as I decide on what's needed and helpful. Anything I rent is impeccably clean, and ready to go -- and as often I use their pick up and delivery service -- reliable and timely are always what comes to mind. You get the consistent value you pay for and that is priceless when you consider the other things on your "to do" list as you plan out events! Highly, highly recommend!

We used them for the top service and a custom ceremony. We used the online portal, paid online, signed the contract online, and were by far the easiest vendor we hired. The invoice reminder kept me honest and the questionnaire was detailed. This company was already shining then we spent two and a half hours on the phone with Josh doing our interview. He wrote the most beautiful script and helped us in so many ways outside of officiating that we ended up hiring weddingly as a day of coordinator too. If you call them you can tell immediately they are really experienced and do this full time. I never thought that someone could have a wedding minister company but they are doing it and it is amazing. I don't remember the name of my officiant but he was excellent. He did everything perfectly including commanding the room for my rehearsal. I remember he said the funniest thing to the guys and it has turned out to be one of those great lasting memories for us ... "If you boys like drinking and eating - ship up, get in line, act like a good third grader, and lets get going! There is food and beer waiting on you." Honestly from the outside it seems condescending but our group is just a bit more rowdy and Josh placed us with the absolute perfect minister who could handle our group of rowdy boys. I wish I could give 10 starsFantast.

Great Customer Service!! My wedding is in St. Louis MO but I was still able to rent table linen for my head table and a few other items. They helped me find items to go with my theme and vision. I was very satisfied.

TSV did lighting for our wedding in Sept. 2015. They did an amazing job! From the beginning they were very kind and knew the look/vision I was going for. I rented many uplights in the amber color to go with my rustic wedding. The uplights were under the barn. I also rented 4 Italian bulb string lights that ran above the dance floor. The lights looked amazing and I cannot tell you how many complements I got about them and how they made my pictures look amazing. TSV even went out of their way to set up a whole day early because my venue had a morning wedding the day of my evening wedding. They company is amazing!!

Great rental company! We had them deliver reception chairs and custom length linens! Delivery and pick up was easy and the quality of what you can rent is truly great!
