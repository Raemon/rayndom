The perfect touch to our ceremony

I could not recommend Sound Solutions of WNY enough! I had Laura and David play piano and cello for my wedding ceremony, and it was absolutely beautiful. They also provided two microphones for us to use, which made everything flow so smoothly. From start to finish, they were a dream to work with—prompt in answering questions, accommodating with my song choices, and so seamless in their transitions between pieces. I didn’t even notice them coming or going, yet their music added the most magical touch to our ceremony. Truly such a beautiful and effortless experience!

5/5 Stars!

I would absolutely recommend Laura and her team for anyone’s wedding or event. The pricing was extremely fair. Not only was Laura our DJ at the reception, but also a string duet played before the ceremony and Laura played piano during cocktail hour. The string duet played our first dance song as I walked down the aisle and it was executed flawlessly. It was a really nice touch. They have a lot of popular songs that they can play as well. Laura was very professional and always responded quickly. She did a great job at the reception, playing a great mix of songs and being conscious of the crowd’s energy and what kept people dancing. There is honestly no reason not to book with Laura and Sound Solutions! I am so happy we did!

May 9 2025 wedding

We cannot recommend Laura highly enough as a wedding DJ! From start to finish, she brought professionalism, warmth, and an incredible sense of timing and style to our big day. Every musical detail was thoughtfully executed, and her ability to coordinate all the moving parts made everything flow effortlessly.  
  
Our ceremony began with the classic beauty of organ music in the church. Following the ceremony, guests were treated to live string music creating an elegant and relaxed atmosphere that set the perfect tone for the evening.  
  
During the reception, Laura truly shined. Not only was she a fantastic DJ who knew exactly how to read the room and keep the dance floor full, but she was also a behind-the-scenes coordinator who made the entire night run smoothly. She communicated clearly and consistently.  
  
Her presence was the perfect balance of professional and personable — guiding the evening with warmth, energy, and attention to detail. She made announcements with grace, kept the timeline on track, and curated a playlist that blended our personal taste with songs that kept guests dancing all night.  
  
Laura exceeded every expectation we had. If you’re looking for someone who can do it all — from church coordination to live music to an unforgettable party — Laura is the one. She was such a vital part of our day, and we’re so grateful for the joy and magic she helped create.

The Best Choice Ever!

We don’t even know where to begin. Sound Solutions of WNY, Laura, was literally amazing and hands-down one of the best decisions we made for our wedding day.  
  
From the moment we first reached out, she was warm, professional, and genuinely excited to help make our day unforgettable. Laura made sure to communicate what songs were important to use and learned new ones, to play live on piano, just for our wedding! What makes her so unique is the incredible combination of live piano talent for the ceremony and top tier DJ skills for the reception, it’s the best of both worlds! Which is what we were looking for with our wedding.   
  
During our ceremony, the live piano music brought actual tears to our eyes (and many of our guests too). It was so elegant, heartfelt, and perfectly timed. Then, at the reception, Laura switched gears seamlessly into DJ mode and got the party started! Her song choices were impeccable, the energy was electric, and she was able to read the crowd like a true pro. She also handled all the microphones for the ceremony and speeches which put my nerves at ease!  
  
People are still talking about how amazing the music was and the vibe of the wedding. Honestly, we can’t thank her enough for helping to create such magical moments.  
  
If you’re on the fence, don’t be. Book them. Right now. You will not regret it.

You won’t go wrong with Sound Solutions!

Laura was excellent. We used Sound Solutions for our ceremony music, cocktail hour string trio, and our DJ. Although she had a lot to juggle, including our detailed requests and song lists, she did a wonderful job. And, the pricing was incredibly reasonable. Laura reached out to our venue to ensure a smooth setup and break down as well as to our church to make sure things would be smooth.  
  
Laura’s wedding guidance lent itself to more than just the music, thanks to her experience in weddings   
  
Go with Sound Solutions!

Incredible music from the ceremony to the dance floor 

Leading up to the wedding, Laura was very responsive to our emails and asked questions after we submitted our music requests to ensure she had the right materials.   
  
She got to our venue super early to set up and make sure everything was set!   
  
Laura performed on the keyboard during our ceremony with our chosen songs, “Skinny Love” and “Somewhere Only We Know.” After we got married and were about to walk back down the aisle, the Bluetooth unfortunately shorted out (not her fault) and the song we requested to play could not play. Laura immediately hopped onto the keyboard and made a smooth transition for us to get back down the aisle!   
  
When the wedding party was introduced at the reception, she made sure to take the time to learn how to pronounce everyone’s name correctly and even stalled for us while I got my dress bustled.   
  
Laura kept the timeline on track during our intros, first dance, cake cutting, and speeches.   
  
She seamlessly mixed our song requests for the dancing part of the night with guest requests and general crowd pleasers. She got everyone dancing!   
  
When we were first planning our wedding, we thought we could skip out on a dj to save money and just make a playlist. My advice - don’t do that. The night would not have moved along without Laura. She is absolutely worth the price.

Piano & DJ

Laura did a fantastic job playing piano during our ceremony and cocktail hour. She also provided DJ services for dancing. She took the time to learn new songs for the ceremony, visited the Botanical Gardens ahead of time to confirm the setup, and made sure all of our song requests were played! Our family and friends gave us many compliments on the music, and we're grateful that we chose Laura for our special day.

The DJ who made our wedding perfect 

We had the absolute pleasure of having Laura as our wedding DJ, and we couldn't be happier with our choice! From start to finish, Laura was incredibly professional, personable, and so easy to work with. She really listened to our preferences and curated the perfect playlist that had everyone on the dance floor all night long. Laura kept everything flowing smoothly, from the ceremony to the reception, ensuring each moment was perfectly timed with the right tunes. We couldn’t have asked for a better DJ to help make our day unforgettable!

Wedding music

Sound Solutions of WNY was incredible from start to finish! We had live piano music during the ceremony in addition to DJ services for the reception. Laura played beautifully and was very accommodating to our requests. Everyone loved the variety of dance music that was played. Laura at Sound Solutions of WNY is extremely professional and wonderful to work with!
