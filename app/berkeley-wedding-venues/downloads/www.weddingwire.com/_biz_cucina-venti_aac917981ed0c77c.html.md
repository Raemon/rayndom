Chris & Lisa's Rehearsal Dinner

I am writing to express my sincere appreciation for the exceptional experience my fiancée and I had at Cucina Venti for our rehearsal dinner. We were delighted to host 75 of our closest family members and wedding party on your beautiful terraces.  
  
The evening began with a wonderful cocktail reception, followed by a three-course plated dinner. Our guests had a choice of steak, fish, chicken, or a vegetarian option, and everyone raved about the incredible food and top-notch service.  
  
Thank you for making our rehearsal dinner such a memorable and enjoyable event.
