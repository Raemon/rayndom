We truly cannot say enough good things about DJ Guana. From the moment the dance floor opened, it was packed and it stayed that way for four straight hours. Not a single lull, not a single reason to step away. The music was perfectly timed, the transitions were seamless, and every song kept the energy high. They read the crowd flawlessly and created an atmosphere where everyone, of all ages, just wanted to keep dancing. If you want a full dance floor and unforgettable energy all night long, this is the DJ you want. Hands down one of the best decisions we made.

Tuvimos realmente el privilegio de tener a Esteban en nuestra boda, fue pieza clave y sin duda dió ese toque especial a este momento. Atendió todo lo que le mencionamos de gustos y preferencias, la atención, servicio, puntualidad y personalidad fue más de lo que esperábamos. Gracias a Esteban por no solo dar un servicio, si no también una experiencia completa y hacer la mejor fiesta. Es una recomendación a ojos cerrados.

We had so much fun at our wedding and Joshua was a huge part of that. He was collaborative as we planned for the big day and took all of our crazy requests and feedback. We have a pretty interesting taste in music and Joshua really helped fold that into a mix that was fun and exactly what we wanted! We ended up having the most fun party and everyone at our wedding was dancing. I would highly recommend working with Joshua and Deepsound if you are planning a wedding in CR. You will not be disappointed!

We were looking for a wedding DJ that was easy to work with, respected our requests, and was not “cheesy”. Mason was the PERFECT fit. He was also willing to extend another 30 minutes on the spot since we didn’t want the party to end. I would use him for any event! Professional. On time. Flexible. 10/10!

DJ Ciro was awesome! We hired him to do our cocktail hour and reception for our wedding in Playa Langosta. We had so many compliments from our guests how amazing the music was. We had given him a playlist and he sprinkled in other music that fit our vibe. We had a small wedding of 50ish people and almost everyone was dancing the entire time. Music is one of the most important aspects of the wedding and DJ Ciro nailed it. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a DJ in Costa Rica. He will not disappoint!

Wow, what an unforgettable night! Our dance floor was packed the whole night. DJ Bryan was extremely professional throughout the process and on the day of the wedding. He took our final song list literally the night before the wedding (so sorry about that) and executed seamlessly. Everyone kept talking about how great the playlist was and a lot of the fun was due to how well Bryan read the crowd (which was a diverse group of people). Would highly recommend for your next big event!

DJ Vito did an amazing job!!! We had a destination wedding in Costa Rica and had people from the US, Costa Rica, and Mexico. He managed to incorporate music from all 3 cultures in a way that flowed beautifully. People did not move from the dance floor and to this day guests are asking me for the playlist. He did an amazing job, and we didn't even end up giving him a list of songs because we forgot too. The amazing music was all from him. I highly recommend him!!
