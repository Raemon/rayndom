After working with Colleen on my 40th birthday party, I knew she was the one to work with for our wedding. I contracted for the day of coordination services but in my opinion, we got much more than that. Colleen and her team coordinated all the vendors, saved us extra fees on delivery and pick up, and provided all the final details to make our wedding beautiful. On the day of they handled all the set up, kept us on time, and managed some very crabby caterers. The whole day was stress-free thanks to Colleen and her team!

I had the pleasure of working with Kristen and her team recently and they were absolutely amazing during our wedding process! Kristen was professional, fun, detailed, and you can really tell she is experienced and loves what she does. She diligently communicated and collaborated with us and all the other vendors. Kristen provided great ideas, assisted with finding vendors, helped me navigate through my decision process, and even helped with decor set up and breakdown at the wedding. Every time we talked she made me feel less stressed about the planning process and I did not worry about a thing on our wedding day! She was truly instrumental in bringing my vision to life and I am so grateful she was our wedding planner and coordinator! Our wedding went so smoothly, even my family and friends raved about how great she was! I would 100% recommend her to anyone who is looking for a wedding planner/coordinator, I guarantee you will have a great experience!

Marylee and her team were incredible and they played such a huge part in making our wedding a successful event. Marylee is very organized, communicates clearly and in a timely manner, and really goes above and beyond for her couples. Her leadership and decision making made for a smooth and enjoyable evening for everyone. She has amazing relationships with other vendors, so on top of being our coordinator, she also served as a great advisor and vendor liaison whenever we needed her. And on top of all of that, she is also a talented designer and florist and has a great team behind her. Do yourself a favor and book MME!

Debbie was wonderful! She was extremely responsive and so organized. I was not stressed on my wedding day at all and I credit a lot of that to Debbie! I would highly recommend using her as a planner! The DJ services were perfect as well :)

We really enjoyed working with Lindsey and her team! Due to COVID and us moving abroad, we had to change our wedding date twice. Lindsey was very flexible with us and helped us move our date with the vendors without any price increases. The vendors she recommended were also very flexible and willing to work with us and our wedding vision. Don’t let me forget about our day of coordinators! Adrianne and Ashley were incredible! They kept us on track the entire night, while also allowing us to have fun and not feel pressured. I would definitely recommend Lindsey and her team for your wedding.

I was very particular with what I wanted for our wedding! Like many brides, I had a vision in my head of what I had always wanted. Walking in to my reception the day of, I was blown away! It was even better than I had imagined it could be. I was very particular about wanting a specific color palette but wanted the flowers to be a pop of color to add to it. Caroline exceeded all expectations here! The flowers were STUNNING! She even went above and beyond and had my flowers stored after the wedding so they could be preserved. I also was so impressed that her team handled the set up and clean up of everything at the venue— even the extra detail DIYs I did. She also returned everything to me in mint condition. When I say Caroline thought of everything, she truly did! My bridesmaids commented about how calm I seemed the day of and that was because I had Caroline and her team handling every detail so that I didn’t have to worry. Caroline truly made the process so easy, handling last minute hiccups on the venue side with ease and not stressing me out with the details of it all! Thank you CLED!
