The Carriage House at Rockwood Park was the perfect venue for our special day!! Brandywine Prime catered, they're partners so it was all inclusive. They took care of EVERYTHING. Everyone was pleasant to work with, and very professional. I would highly recommend anyone looking for convenience to book this beautiful venue. You shouldn't have to lift a finger on your special day, Katie & Michael made sure our experience was top notch. We can't thank them enough!!

We got married at Ashore at the end of October. From the planning process to the final song, everything was seamless. Lisa Wilgus specifically made the process incredibly easy, and she was very transparent with pricing, which we greatly appreciated. Ashore also did a very good job of laying out who was responsible for what, so there were no surprises come wedding day. All of the guests were extremely complimentary, and Claire and myself could not be happier that we chose Ashore!

Auburn Valley State Park was the most beautiful place I could have imagined. Working with Crystal Boddy was wonderful, she answered all my questions quickly and was accommodating and friendly.

Planning a wedding in 2020 has really proven to be difficult. Our original venue canceled on us 2 months before our big day and from the minute that we reached out to DCH I knew everything was going to be okay. The grounds themselves were absolutely stunning and I could have not asked for a more perfect place to get married; it was truly picturesque. Erica was exceptional. She’s incredibly talented and the love for what she does really shines through. Everything I asked of Erica, she promptly delivered with amazing attention to detail. I can not express my gratitude for DCH and Erica enough for coming to the rescue and making our wedding even more perfect then I could have imagined. -The Lashbrook’s

Nage Restaurant provided the food for our 60th birthday party with 50+ guests held two weeks ago. It was delicious, beautifully presented, professionally & seamlessly served (including toasts and drinks), and the appetizer options were simply exquisite. La Vida Hospitality catering staff and management organized the food choices, tent, kitchen rentals, and a much appreciated tasting to confirm our menu options. La Vida staff on the day were top notch - experienced, timely, professional, and delightful.
