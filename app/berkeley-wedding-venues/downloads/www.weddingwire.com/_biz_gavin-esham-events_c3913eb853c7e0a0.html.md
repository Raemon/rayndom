Event Planner GURU

Gavin was INCREDIBLE to work with! He listened to our ideas, heard what we were saying, and helped us execute the perfect wedding day. He never tried to ‘sell’ us something extra or ‘add on’ anything that was out of our budget. He was very real and upfront every step of the way. He offered awesome alternatives to ideas we had that saved us money, and made our wedding day go so smoothly. He reeled us back in when we were straying too far off the path! Our wedding went off without a hitch and we never knew if anything went wrong. He made connections with his contacts to help us pull some last minute decor things together and became a beautiful friend by the end of the process. He bowed out gracefully at the end of the night and has remained the top person I have recommended to people (everyone I know or meet) over the years. Whether you’re looking for full fledged wedding/event planning or just someone to help guide you through the process- Gavin is definitely your guy!

Wedding Whisperer

In complete frustration over the increasing details of wedding planning, I happened upon Gavin and immediately felt compelled and confident in handing him the reins. At our first meeting he told me he would be my "wedding whisperer" and that sealed the deal. Always quick to respond, provide advice when needed and very personable and witty. Our family loved him. He provided the most comprehensive, impressive timeline that covered everything! Best decision ever.

Destination Guru

I don’t even know where to begin — working with Gavin for our destination wedding was an absolute dream come true! He made the entire planning process feel effortless, organized, and (dare I say) fun — even from thousands of miles away.  
  
Every detail, from coordinating with vendors to creating a seamless timeline, was handled with such professionalism and care. Gavin anticipated things I never would have thought of and made sure everything ran flawlessly on the big day. I was able to truly relax and enjoy every moment, knowing we were in the best hands possible.  
  
Our wedding turned out to be everything we imagined and more — stunning, joyful, and perfectly “us.” Guests are still talking about how beautiful and well-organized everything was!  
  
If you’re considering hiring Gavin for your wedding — especially a destination celebration — don’t hesitate for a second. He is truly a magician in the world of weddings and made our dream day a reality. 💕

Your go-to wedding planner

Planning my wedding has been a dream of mine since I was a young girl. I envisioned talking to all of my vendors and giving them my visions, setting up the venue, decorating my seating chart, and coming up with our timeline for the best day of my life. About 6 weeks before my wedding, I panicked in the midst of all of my documents and tote bins full of decor. I realized I could not do this all myself AND have a stressed and care-free day. This is where Gavin came in- ready to save my perfect day. He knew what I needed and delivered it without stress or panic, despite the tight timeline we had at that point. He immediately put my mind at ease. He helped orchestrate the perfect timeline, walked us through our rehearsal, and made sure our day ran with the utmost grace. He worked with my vendors that day and helped set up my decor so that the venue looked like my dreams coming to life. I cannot recommend Gavin Esham Events enough, to all of the brides and grooms searching for a seamless and perfect day. You can trust him with all of your visions, worries, and “musts”- he will deliver it all, and then some 🤍

Just Fabulous 

I couldn’t have been happier or more thankful for having Gavin as my day of wedding coordinator. I loved planning my wedding, but I was set on having a day of coordinator to minimize stress on the big day. Well, with Gavin, there was no stress at all! I didn’t have to worry about a single thing because I knew based on how thorough and organized he was from the beginning, he would handle everything we needed to make sure the day went smoothly. I can still remember getting ready when Gavin came in and said the florist couldn’t find the boxes I dropped off. After confirming what I gave the florist, he said “Don’t worry, I’m on it” and I knew I didn’t even have to give it another thought. From setting up at the venue, coordinating with vendors, keeping the day to the timeline, and even helping to bustle my dress - he does it all - and so well! From a very type A bride, I truly couldn’t recommend him enough.

Simply the best! 

Gavin was truly a lifesaver in our wedding planning. With my husband finishing cancer treatment, a new business on my plate, and the stress of wedding details, I was completely overwhelmed. Gavin stepped in with calm, kindness, and incredible organizational skills that made everything fall into place. Thanks to him, I could actually enjoy my engagement and wedding instead of drowning in stress. He’s professional, compassionate, and truly gifted at what he does. I can’t recommend him enough!
