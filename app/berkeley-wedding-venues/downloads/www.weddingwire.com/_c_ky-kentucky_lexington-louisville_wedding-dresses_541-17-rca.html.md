## How much does a wedding dress cost?

Buying a wedding dress is unlike purchasing a piece of everyday attire. You’re going to be wearing this dress on one of the most important days of your life, and so you’ll likely spend quite a bit of money on your [wedding dress](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/dresses). While wedding dress prices do vary greatly, the average wedding dress cost in the U.S. is $1,000. It typically ranges from $280 to $1,650, but you can purchase a wedding dress for far above and below those prices.

  * __ $ 236 or less Lower range
  * __ $ 1,280  Average cost
  * __ $ 828 - $ 1,750  Most couples spend between
  * __ $ 2,730 or more Upper range



Costs displayed are based on spend from thousands of couples who recently reported pricing for this service within their WeddingWire review. Pricing varies based on factors including, but not limited to, vendor’s experience, level of expertise, event guest count, date, and geographic region.

What impacts wedding dress prices?

__

There are a few factors that will impact your wedding dress cost. Most notably, an extremely detailed wedding dress with lots of beading and pricey fabric (silk, etc.) will cost more than a simpler wedding dress, as more intricate gowns require more labor and materials. So a [grand ball gown](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/dresses/ball-gown) with beading and detailed embroidery will cost more than a plainer [sheath dress](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/dresses/sheath). Also, if you’re set on wearing a wedding dress by a famous dress designer, know that it will likely cost more. 

What additional wedding dress costs should a bride plan for?

__

There are several additional costs that brides should factor into their wedding dress cost and budget. These include:

  * Alterations: If you want to drastically change your wedding dress, your alterations may end up costing more than your actual wedding dress!
  * Undergarments and accessories: Be sure to factor in your accessories— [bridal undergarments](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-shop-for-wedding-undergarments), shoes, and more. These accessories will greatly affect how your gown looks and fits, so don’t forget to include them in your wedding dress cost.
  * Cleaning and preservation: Don’t be surprised if you’re still spending money on your wedding dress after your wedding! Whether you plan on wearing your wedding dress again, passing it on to a future generation, or none of the above, it’s still a good idea to have your gown professionally cleaned and preserved. Wedding dress cleaning and preservation can cost $200 or more.



How can you save money on a wedding dress?

__

Yes, a bride’s wedding dress will cost a lot of money—probably more than you’ll spend on another piece of attire in your life! However, there are several ways to [save money on your wedding dress](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/save-money-on-a-wedding-dress) while still finding a gown that you absolutely love.

  * Don’t try on dresses that are over-budget: Be upfront with your bridal salon consultant about your budgets—and be sure ask about the cost of each dress you try on. Avoid the temptation of trying on a wedding dress that’s out of your price range.
  * Find a simple wedding dress, and accessorize: As mentioned, a simple and relatively unadorned wedding gown will cost less than an extremely detailed wedding dress. If you’re on a tight wedding dress budget, we recommend finding a simple gown and using a beaded sash or a brooch to give it some extra sparkle.
  * Find a dress you love as is: Any significant alterations or customizations that you do to a wedding dress will cost (a lot of!) money. Therefore, if you want to make significant changes to a wedding dress (add sleeves, change the silhouette, etc.), that gown is probably not for you. Look for a wedding dress that you love mostly as it looks off the hanger.
  * Scour sample sales: Many bridal salons offer sample sales where they sell sample dresses from past seasons. These sample dresses are typically in sizes 6 to 12, so if you fall in that size category, you may find a gorgeous gown at a low price at one of these sales.
  * Visit trunk shows: If you’re set on purchasing a gown by a specific designer, you might find a deal at a trunk show. Trunk shows are when a bridal salon features the collection of a particular dress designer—and usually offers a discount (usually about 5 or 10 percent off that designer’s wedding dress prices). Research which salons in your area carry your favorite designers, and check their websites for upcoming trunk shows.
  * Give yourself time to shop: A wedding dress can take several months to arrive after you’ve ordered it. Be sure to [start shopping for your wedding dress as soon as possible](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/why-you-must-shop-for-your-wedding-dress-early) —many brides shop at least nine months in advance, if not more. If you wait until the last minute, you may end up paying rush charges for your dress, which can greatly add to your total wedding dress cost.



How much does it cost to alter a wedding dress?

__

[Wedding dress alterations](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/tips-for-wedding-dress-alterations-fittings) can be expensive—particularly if you’re planning on making major changes to your wedding dress. Some bridal salons offer wedding dress alterations in-house. If yours does not, you will likely have to find a tailor who specializes in wedding dresses (be sure to read online reviews of wedding dress tailors before hiring). You’ll typically schedule your wedding dress fittings for at least three months before your big day—so plan accordingly. 76 percent of bridal salons charge alterations by piece rather than a flat fee, so the average cost of dress alterations can vary widely depending on the extent of the alterations. Simply adjusting a hemline won’t cost a ton, but adding sleeves or reworking a bodice will! 

What questions should you ask a wedding dress tailor?

__

When choosing a wedding dress tailor, there are several questions you should ask:

  * How many fitting appointments will I need? How long will the process take?
  * What types of alterations do you recommend for my wedding dress?
  * Have you worked with a dress and fabric like mine before?
  * Can you provide a cost for my alterations?
  * How will you store my wedding dress?
  * What do I need to bring to my first fitting appointment?

Generation Tux was great to work with. I went in to get my Tux measurements, and the associates fitted me and put the measurements into their system. My tux came exactly two weeks before my wedding. The shirt was too tight around the neck, but they sent a replacement shirt within three days. Everything else about the tux was perfect! They provided shirt studs and cuff links, which looked great. Returning the tux was quick and easy with the bag they provided. Highly Recommend!

If I could give higher than a 5 I would. I found my wedding gown today at their store. It was such an amazing experience. The staff was amazing. It was such a personal and inspiring environment. They had so many dresses to pick from and the prices are unbelievable. They have something for all budgets. I have had rough times in the past trying on dresses and they truly changed my experience. They were so uplifting and made me feel so beautiful. I found my dress and left I’m happy tears. I can’t wait to bring my bridesmaids back for their dresses here soon. I would 10/10 recommend them for any wedding or formal dresses you may need.

They did such a great job cleaning my dress the first time. After I got back from the beach my dress was stinky dirty and smelly. It had been drug on dirty sand and also in parking lots and resturants. I tried to pick it up as much as I could but it's hard. I will go back to them again to clean it since my reception is over. The only negative is man is it expensive. Or at least more than I expected.

I took my wedding dress to Yvette's to have it altered. She was extremely friendly and helpful. The dress was a size 8 and I was a size 2. I went back for a couple of fittings and the last time I went she ended up needing to hem the front a little. She completed it quickly and I was able to take my dress home that day more than a month before my wedding day! It fit perfectly and I was extremely satisfied! I highly recommend her!

Couture Closet was so great to work with! Tera helped me find the perfect dress. She was so sweet and made me feel so comfortable trying on different dresses, and was so patient letting me try on so many until I found the one! They made the whole wedding dress buying process smooth and easy. I went to another local wedding boutique before Couture Closet, and while they were nice, they just weren’t the same. Couture Closet just felt so much more personable and made me so comfortable. I felt at ease and like they really cared! Couldn’t have asked for a better experience for buying my wedding dress!
