We got married on September 23, 2023. Honestly, I couldn't have asked for a better venue. It was sophisticated and elegant, but also convenient given you can do everything on site. One thing to know about Kohl is that it's just the venue; nothing else is included. Which we took as a win, as we wanted to choose our own vendors, and also bring our own alcohol (which Kohl lets you do at no charge). We found our photography & catering vendors through their recommended list. Denise as our main POC was a gem, absolutely phenomenal in person though occasionally a little delayed over email. I really felt like she cared about making our day special, and she was very quick to share photos of other events to give us ideas, or help us brainstorm how to use a room. She didn't end up being our POC day-of, but Carol was wonderful too. As for the guests' experience, it was so good. There's plenty of parking on site, and we had a Welcome sign that easily directed them to the patio for refreshments before the ceremony. Honestly the only snag was that the grass was a bit soft and squishy so it wasn't the easiest to walk in. But then moving to the patio for cocktail hour was so seamless. And then when everyone went into the main hall for the reception, it was just beautiful. We ended up having dinner & dancing in the main hall, dessert in the black & white room, a lounge area in the white / green room, a game room in the library, and used the hallway near the staircase for a video booth. Guests being able to use so much of the space throughout the night, including the outside patio too, was so nice. The other thing I'll mention is the rooms upstairs — they have a beautiful groom's room and bride's room. You can't be there all day, just as soon as your time window starts, which for us was at 2:30pm. But then we also were able to turn the groom's room into a nursing / babysitting room for folks with little ones. All in all, I'm so thrilled we had our wedding at Kohl — it was a dream!

Our experience with Fairview Crystal Springs in Burlingame was nothing short of amazing! From the moment we began planning our wedding, less than six months out, Nikki and Abbie were incredibly organized, responsive, and genuinely invested in making our day perfect. Planning from afar could have been stressful, but their professionalism, warmth, and attention to detail made the process seamless and enjoyable. Our wedding day itself was absolutely magical. Every detail came together beautifully, from the breathtaking views and decor to the flawless coordination that kept everything running smoothly. Avonne’s floral designs, especially our centerpieces and sweetheart table arrangement, were stunning. DJ Storm brought so much life and energy to the reception; our guests never left the dance floor! We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better team. The Fairview Crystal Springs staff made our dream wedding a reality, and we’ll cherish these memories forever. Thank you for going above and beyond to make our day special! ~Gen & Cai

We had our ceremony here. The church itself is beautiful- the outside facade as well as the interior. We opted to go without any floral arrangements at the altar because it was pretty enough by itself. It is dark inside, something for photographers to note. And beside the front steps there's not much of an outside backdrop for photos. The staff is wonderful and very helpful though. They responded quickly to all of our questions. A great location for our ceremony!

I can only say positive things with our experience at Marriott SFO Waterfront in Burlingame, CA. We chose this hotel to have our wedding on 6/9/18. EVERYONE was so friendly, helpful and accommodating. Alicia Gonzalez with the sales team helped us book the space and was so flexible and creative with helping us see the vision. Our wedding was in Bayside Rooms I, II and III. Alicia gave us the great idea to do the ceremony in Bayside II, cocktail hour in Bayside I (with the great view of the airport and Bay water), while the staff turned Bayside II & III into the banquet room. Essentially, all three rooms were opened into one banquet room with the bar and photo booth in the cocktail room. It was very spacious for a wedding of 110 guests. We could've added more tables! Jennifer Vizcarra, our Event Manager! How lucky were we to have her! She's very responsive and so patient with all our questions. Our wedding would not have gone as smoothly as it did without her! She walked us through all the necessities and provided clear direction. She worked very closely with us on everything. Chef Walter was very accommodating with our menu selections during the tasting and even came out to us at the wedding to ensure everything was okay. The entire Marriott staff (chef, banquet staff, valet, bell hop, front desk, restaurant & bar staff, housekeeping..everyone!) were all so friendly. We were always greeted with a smile & the staff were so helpful with everything we needed. The hotel rooms were clean & updated. We had a suite with our wedding package & it was so nice & spacious! I felt like I was at home! We're local and will definitely go back for meals and drinks. You couldn't ask for a better view! They have different rooms for all size events. It's a great venue and I HIGHLY recommend for you to at least do a tour and see what they have to offer! I know the Marriott team will do their best to make your event successful!

This is a beautiful venue we visited while we were in the area. The staff is so helpful. Morton has helped us. The hall was half booked for the date we were looking for and the other hall was not exactly what we were looking for therefore we didn’t pursue this venue but great customer service and beautiful hotel.

We inquired a year ago September with Brenda Portos and from the first day to the day of our event she was always professional and willing to meet our every need. Both Banquet Managers Merek and Minor gave us just the same exact service as did the entire staff. I have been an Event Planner in the bay area for nearly 40 years and worked with all the Hiltons in the area and by far this staff has far exceeded any location I have worked with!

The best of wedding planners starts with Joanie! I was married in the middle of a pandemic, and while planning a normal wedding has enough stress of its own this event invited even more pressure. I was very grateful to have Joanie in my corner. She offered flexible deadlines, timely suggestions of solutions to counter the hindrance of social distancing, and best of all she was a friend who reminded me to enjoy the process something I often forgot. It was such a treat to work with her.
