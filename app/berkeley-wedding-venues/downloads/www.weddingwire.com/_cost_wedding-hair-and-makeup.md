## How much does wedding hair and makeup cost? 

You definitely want to look your best on your wedding day to [slay those wedding photos](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-take-wedding-photos-like-a-pro)—so be sure to entrust your hair and makeup to the professionals! Of course, you’ll have to pay to have your hair and makeup done, but it is certainly worth it. The average wedding hair and makeup cost in the U.S. is around $300, but typically ranges from $150 to $600 depending on both your location and the intricacy of the wedding hair or makeup style you’d like. 

## What is included in the price of a bridal hair and makeup package?

In general, your wedding hair and makeup cost will include your stylist’s or makeup artist’s time on your wedding day. Most hair and makeup pros charge by the hour, so the longer you need your hair stylist and makeup artist to be present during your wedding, the more you’ll pay. Also know that for hair stylists, wedding updos tend to cost more than blowouts—in fact, the average cost of a bridal updo is $100 and the average cost of a simpler blowout is $55. When it comes to makeup, airbrush makeup typically comes with a higher price tag than traditional application. The average cost of airbrush makeup is $115 while the average cost of traditional makeup is $100. Some pros include a hair or makeup trial in their bridal makeup prices or wedding hair prices, but some do charge extra. 

## How far in advance should I book my hair and makeup artist?

We recommend booking your wedding hair stylist and makeup artist at least three months before your wedding. Start by [reading online reviews of beauty pros near your wedding location](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-beauty-health), and then reach out to a few to find out availability and pricing. You may want to interview several [wedding hair stylists](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-questions-to-ask-a-hair-stylist) and [makeup artists](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-questions-to-ask-a-wedding-makeup-artist) to find someone you’re comfortable with, and whose style and vision matches yours. 

## Are there any add-on costs for wedding hair and makeup?

Depending on your style, needs, and budget, there are many different possible add-ons to bridal makeup packages or to your wedding hair cost. A few examples:

  * Extra services: There are certain makeup techniques and styles that might add dollars to your bridal makeup cost. For example, [false lashes may cost extra](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-eye-makeup-tips-from-the-pros), as can airbrush makeup. When [ choosing your wedding-day makeup style](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/what-should-your-wedding-day-makeup-style-be), be sure to factor in these additional costs.
  * Travel: If your wedding hair and makeup pros work out of a salon, you may have to pay extra for them to travel to your wedding location. And if it’s an especially long distance, you may have to pay even more for mileage.
  * Additional people: If you’re planning on having your hair stylist or makeup artist also provide services to your bridesmaids, mom, etc., you’ll have to pay more. Your hair stylist or makeup artist may choose to bring an assistant to help speed things along on your wedding day—another add-on to your wedding makeup cost or wedding hair cost.
  * Additional hours/touch-ups: Want your hair stylist or makeup artist to be on hand at different times throughout your wedding day to provide touch-ups or even a new ‘do for your reception? The more time you have your beauty pros on hand, the more you’ll pay for your wedding hair and wedding makeup prices.
  * Trial: As mentioned, many wedding hair stylists and makeup artists charge extra for a trial run.
  * Tips: Many couples forget to [ factor tips into their wedding-day budget](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-tipping-guide). We recommend tipping your hair stylist and makeup artist as though it was a regular appointment—15 to 20 percent of the total cost for each professional.



## What are wedding hair and makeup trials? And how much do they cost?

A [wedding hair and/or makeup trial](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-questions-to-ask-a-wedding-makeup-artist) allows you to meet with your hair or beauty pro a few months before your wedding, and see how exactly your hair and makeup will look on your wedding day. You can also make any tweaks or adjustments if necessary. If your hair stylist or makeup artist charges extra for a trial, the average cost is $75 per service. 

## How much does bridesmaid makeup cost?

It’s a good idea to have your bridesmaids’ makeup professionally done—they’ll feel more confident and look even better in photos! The average wedding makeup cost for bridesmaids is $75 per service.

## How much does bridesmaid hair cost?

The cost to style [bridesmaids’ hair](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/9-bridesmaid-hairstyles-we-know-youll-love) depends on the style. If your bridesmaids require a simple blowout for a down or half-up hairstyle, the average cost is $50. If they are wearing their hair in an updo, the average cost is $75.

## Do I have to pay for my bridesmaids’ hair and makeup?

[Being a bridesmaid](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/bride-vs-bridesmaids-who-pays-for-what) can be quite a financial undertaking. If you are requiring that your bridesmaids have their makeup and hair professionally done, you should pay for it. If your bridesmaids are given the option to either have their hair and makeup done by a pro or to DIY, then they can pay for it themselves. 

## How much are some typical pre-wedding beauty treatments?

There are many [different pre-wedding beauty treatments](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/everything-to-know-about-upgrading-your-bridal-beauty-look) that can help you look and feel your best on your wedding day. We recommend giving yourself ample time to try any new beauty treatments before your wedding in case you’re not a fan of the results—and be sure to factor these extras into your budget. Here are the average costs of pre-wedding beauty treatments, but note that the cost of each service does vary depending on your location and the exact services you’re receiving:

  * Tanning: If your skin needs that golden glow, tanning costs an average of $40.
  * Massage therapy: A pre-wedding massage can be a great stress-reliever for a bride. The average cost of pre-wedding massage services is $70.
  * Facials: Prep and prime your skin for your big day! Bridal facials cost an average of $65.
  * Manicures: Your hands and fingers will be on display throughout your wedding day—everyone will want to check out your new bling! The average cost of a manicure is $25.
  * Pedicures: Your feet deserved to be pampered, too! The average cost of a pre-wedding pedicure is $38.
  * Body art: For Indian brides, mehendi is an important part of the pre-wedding preparations. The average cost of body art like mehendi is $75.
