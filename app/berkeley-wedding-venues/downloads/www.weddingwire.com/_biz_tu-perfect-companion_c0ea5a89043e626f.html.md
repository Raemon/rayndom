A+ Service

For our Wedding weekend, we hired Monica to take care of Rubi, our French Bulldog. We wanted her to be included in our photos, so Monica brought her to the venue for a couple of hours while we took photos and then took her home again. A+ service. Would recommend to friends and family as well!

Highly recommended

Could not have asked for a better service. Monica handled my dogs during my wedding. I felt very comfortable leaving them in her care. She watched my dogs before and after the ceremony and was punctual to the location. Highly recommend having her as a pet attendant in your wedding.
