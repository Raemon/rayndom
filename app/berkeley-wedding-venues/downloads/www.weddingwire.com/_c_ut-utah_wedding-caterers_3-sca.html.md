I hired Crisp after getting quotes and talking to about 20 other vendors. We were looking for a caterer for our large company Christmas Party. Lani and her team were absolute perfection. They took all the time I needed to chat and discuss. Time to pour over what they can do and helped me figure out what would be perfect for us. The taste testing was an amazing experenice! And they exceuted the whole thing amazingly. Everyone was fun, and professional and I was very comfortable with discussing changes or brining up questions. Loved them! We will be using them again soon!

We had the best experience with Hills! They were amazing and everything was perfect. We still get people telling us “I think about the food at your wedding on a weekly basis” and it’s been over 3 months.

My husband and I had a micro wedding in Vegas. We chose Poppa Napps based on the glowing reviews and were not disappointed! The food was AMAZING. My husband is from the south and he said it was the best BBQ he'd had in years. Our guests raved about how delicious it was as well. The service was impeccable. Poppa Napp was friendly and timely. I would recommend any person looking for BBQ catering. You won't regret it!

Shelly was great to work with; we had so many options between cookie, ice cream and toppings. And our guests kept asking where we found our vendor. Big Scoops Creamery is a hidden gem of the Salt Lake Valley.

HPWT was great to work with for our wedding. I worked mostly with Mindy who gave us a clear timeline for when things need to be picked out and planned and help us stay on track. She was very flexible in working within our budget and transparent on costs. We’re still getting compliments on our food, when our wedding was months ago.

Utah Celebrations Catering catered our wedding luncheon after the ceremony and also part of the reception food was done by them. They did an exceptional job. The whole process was easy and their food was excellent. I would highly reccomend them!!
