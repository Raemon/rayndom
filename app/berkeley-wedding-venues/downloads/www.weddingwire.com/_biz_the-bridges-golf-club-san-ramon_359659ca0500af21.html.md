Christmas Wedding at TBGC

TBGC was such a beautiful venue for my christmas themed wedding. My ceremony/reception was held in the clubhouse so we had the nice white, big fireplace as a background and was functional since it was chilly the whole night. The staff was very welcoming and accommodating. I worked with Hillary as my wedding coordinator and she just always went above and beyond for me and would always cater to my needs. I loved working with her! I highly recommend this place!!!

A Dreamy Wedding Venue

My husband and I held our wedding reception at the Bridges Golf Club, the Garden Pavilion room, and we were so delighted at how beautiful everything turned out! We worked with Sharon, who was highly responsive, flexible, and answered our many questions. Sharon was honest and provided great recommendations for the food, table layout, timeline, etc. Her feedback and wonderful communication skills made the wedding planning process so smooth.   
  
The wedding day was a breeze. The staff at the Bridges were on top of things and were on schedule. The table settings were beautiful, the staff were kind and professional, and the setting was stunning. Our guests were blown away by the spectacular views of the canyon, and took epic sunset photos. The staff always checked in on my husband and I to ensure we had sufficient food and drinks. Speaking of food, the food was so delicious! With Sharon's recommendation, we selected the prime rib, salmon, and ravioli. The portions were generous, and the guests were very impressed by the quality! We also had an open bar, and everyone enjoyed the quality of the drinks.  
  
We would recommend the Bridges without hesitation! Thanks Bridges for making our wedding day so magical.

Top tier wedding venue & staff!

My husband & I had the time of our lives at our wedding, which had a lot to do with the professionalism of the staff at The Bridges and how lovely the site was. Numerous guests talked about how beautiful the ceremony site and overall venue was and took a bunch of solo photos because of it. The staff, especially Sharon, was fantastic to work with - Sharon particularly was always responsive and helpful to address any questions or concerns we had.   
  
Another major highlight was the quality and quantity of the dinner food. We did family style and had enough food served for every guest to be full and still have some leftovers. The prime rib was particularly tasty as if it was made at a top steakhouse.   
  
We would gladly recommend The Bridges to anyone considering a Bay Area wedding.

Beautiful Venue for a Wedding

I photographed a wedding here in march 2022, and the venue is beautiful. Great location for gorgeous photos. The sun sets behind the altar and the view is just incredible. What a beautiful scenery to have for your wedding

Amazing venue!

Bridges was the perfect spot for us to have our wedding reception (we did the ceremony in a church where we went to college). Sandy was super responsive and helpful throughout the process. We also hired several vendors from Bridges’ preferred vendor listing or from their other close partnerships who made everything very seamless (Fantasy Sound Events, Cake Delight, Hazy Lane Studios, The Flower House, and Napa Valley Linens). We loved that their food menu had lots of great options and was able to be customized! Overall, we are so happy we did our reception at Bridges. We love that we can always come back to Bridges for golf or lunch at the restaurant to reminisce on our special day. Thank you to the Bridges team!

The Bridges = The Best!

The Bridges Golf Course was our perfect wedding location. The catering and events team (especially Sandy and Emma) were so fantastic in every way. Our food was amazing, the service was attentive, and Bridges staff worked seamlessly with our other vendors. Not to mention a picture-perfect yet convenient location. We couldn't have asked for more! Thank you again for making our wedding day so special :)

The Perfect Venue!

We couldn't have asked for anything more with Bridges! We had one of our wedding events here and it was PERFECT! The staff was very accommodating, helpful, and friendly. They were patient with us through all the pandemic uncertainties and were always available to either hop on a call or meet in person to discuss anything.   
  
The space itself was gorgeous! Not only did we have incredible views of the golf course for photos, but the ball room inside was also stunning with beautiful chandeliers and wood accents. The Bridges team made everything so easy for us and I would 10/10 recommend this venue to our family and friends! Thank you for making our wedding weekend so special and stress free!!

Great Wedding Venue!

Funny enough when I was in high school our junior prom was held at The Bridges Golf Club (TBGC) and now I can't believe our wedding reception was held here! Sandy and TBGC team were a dream to work with! They were always very responsive to all inquiries and the millions of questions I had during the wedding planning process. In the moment it may feel stressful meeting their somewhat strict deadlines but those deadlines are there for a purpose! Having those little details figured out earlier in the game definitely made the whole wedding process smoother. Our guests raved about the beautiful venue and thoroughly enjoyed the food as well! The staff on the day of were very attentive to my husband and I and made sure we were comfortable with enough food, drinks, etc. Their event captain also helped us get the best pictures with our wedding party prior to the event starting. All in all a great experience and I am so happy we went with The Bridges for our reception venue!

The best!

The Bridges is the perfect place to get married. It's beautiful and they take care of just about everything. We had our wedding on 10/03/2021 and it was perfect. Our guests raved about the beautiful venue, food and the great service!!!  
  
Sandy is the main coordinator and who I communicated with most of the time. She is AMAZING!! Planning a wedding during the pandemic was a bit of a challenge but Sandy always answered all of my questions promptly. She is very professional and you can tell she has been doing this for a long time. I have never planned a big event so it was great having Sandy to help us.   
  
Our day of coordinator was Mercedes who was also great !!! She helped with the rehearsal and throughout our wedding day. We were able to enjoy our wedding day as she and the rest of the staff took care of everything.   
  
I would highly recommend The Bridges for your next event !

Great place to get married!

The Bridges Golf Club was an amazing place to get married. From the onset they were very easy to work with, extremely responsive (often I got replies within minutes of my emails), and the wedding ended up being a dream. Everything leading up to the wedding was really well-planned and Celena was in constant communication to make sure that we had everything taken care of leading up to our big day. We enjoyed the food tasting, and working out all of our details. We were very at ease knowing The Bridges had everything taken care of.  
  
On the day of our wedding, everything was great. Everything was set up to do a flip of the fireplace room since we had the ceremony and reception in the same room. Also, they left a plate of hors d’oeuvres and glasses of champagne in the bridal room for us to enjoy immediately after the ceremony before taking photos. They even put our gifts in a safe place during the reception and had all of our toasting flutes, cake knives, and personal things packed up and ready to go for us at the end of the night. It made the whole night effortless for us.  
  
We are so happy we had our wedding at The Bridges, and the day after wished we could have done it all over again the exact same as the day before since we had so much fun!

The Bridges is a gorgeous venue, and my client fell in love with it immediately. The sales department and the service staff on the night of the wedding both did a wonderful job. I don't think I have ever worked with a venue that made setting up a beautiful wedding so easy!
