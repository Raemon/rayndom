Whalehead in Historic Corolla Park is a wedding venue located in Corolla, North Carolina. Nestled on 39 acres of pristine sound-front property, this estate is an idyllic spot for outdoor ceremonies and receptions. Situated in the Outer Banks, the Historic House Museum dates back to the 1920s, when it was constructed by Edward Collins Knight, Jr. for his wife, Marie. The couple were passionate about waterfowl hunting and, when Mrs. Knight wasn’t allowed into male-only hunting clubs, Mr. Knight built the home for his wife. The Art Nouveau building is now open for tours and boasts impressive Tiffany lighting fixtures, corduroy walls, cork flooring, and a restored Steinway piano. There are even rumors of hauntings in this renovated home, for those couples who want to catch a ghost sighting during their romantic weekend. The venue’s surrounding lawns offer lush backdrops and stunning waterfront views for celebrations of love both large and small.

**Facilities and Capacity  
** The extensive property that houses Whalehead in Historic Corolla Park offers several spots where couples can hold their open-air nuptials. These include the North Lawn, a sweeping green that is dotted with 90-year-old majestic live oaks. This site is surrounded by the tranquil Currituck Sound, the iconic red-brick Currituck Beach Lighthouse, a boat basin, and a picturesque footbridge. The South Lawn also provides an expansive space for events and is bordered by a footpath over the pond and a porch with lounge chairs. Intimate ceremonies are also welcome to take place on the Side Porch, where oaks shade the verandah, and on the Gazebo, which overlooks the water. Both of these locations, as well as the grassy Point, can be used for cocktail hours, first looks, and taking pictures with loved ones. Within the manor, two get-ready suites are available for wedding parties to prepare for the walk down the aisle.

**Services Offered  
** Couples who rent Whalehead in Historic Corolla Park will have access to their wedding site from 10am to 11pm on the big day. Rehearsal times are also available the day before, as long as the venue is not previously booked. The staff provides a list of preferred vendors, and tents are recommended to accommodate the reception dinners and dancing. There are ample power supplies on the North and South Lawns for DJs, bands, rental companies, and caterers to use as they please.

May 2024 Whalehead dream wedding

Whalehead was our dream venue. We hosted an 180 person outdoor wedding in May 2024 and we had the time of our lives! We got really lucky with temperate weather, had our ceremony on the Point outdoors, a perfect cocktail hour under the trees off the west porch of the building, and a massive dinner and dancing reception under a huge tent on the North Lawn with Corolla Light in the background. Whalehead was super accomodating and responsive throughout the entire process - big shoutout to Samantha Payne and Chris Hooper! They made sure we had all the permits we need and were so helpful as we worked to organize our various on site vendors for the big day. We had a few folks who required special care and transport and Chris and the golf cart were a wonderful addition to the day. We cannot wait to come back and renew our vows here someday or just visit and take some pictures :)

Wonderful Waterfront

Our Whalehead wedding was everything we wanted it to be, and more! We loved getting married on the waterfront with the historical house and lighthouse in the background. I was nervous about the groom seeing me before I came down the aisle, but Chris knows the layout so well that he was able to hide me along some shrubbery. The weather was perfect and all of the vendors work really well together to make sure everything comes together beautifully. I highly recommend renting a golf cart (which can be done through Whalehead) for your older guests and also for yourself! Chris and Samantha were easy to work with, flexible, and want to make your day as magical as possible!

Stunning venue, helpful staff

I am a wedding planner and recently coordinated a wedding at Whalehead. Through the entire planning process, the venue's staff members, Chris and Samantha, were extremely helpful...even to the point of assisting us with some of the setup and breakdown. My team can't thank them enough! Whalehead is a beautiful venue and makes the perfect setting for both wedding ceremonies and receptions.

Best Wedding Venue

I could not speak more highly of the Whalehead club. Their team went above and beyond to ensure that our wedding went off without a hitch.  
  
The scenery was incredible and the grounds were in pristine condition. For what you get at the Whalehead club especially for the price, you will not find a better wedding venue. We still have friends telling us how magical the night was.

Historic Corolla Park Gazebo Wedding 

Historic Corolla Park was the most amazing place to have our wedding. The little Gazebo they offer for small wedding was exactly what my wife and I were looking for! Kemberly was the Whalehead representative we worked with and she couldn’t have been better! She was quick to respond to every single question we had! I would recommend this venue to anyone looking to have a small intimate wedding in the outer banks! We cannot wait to get the pictures back!

Romantic sights, responsive and helpful staff, wow factor 

After going to OBX for vacation every year for 20 years, Whalehead was a no brainer contender for a wedding venue once we started planning our wedding. Kemberly, the coordinator at Whalehead, made that decision even easier. She was incredibly helpful, always quick to respond, and was a pro in every meaning of the word. The day of our wedding we got to enjoy a beautiful cotton candy sunset, as if the views from the south lawn and point weren’t beautiful enough. There were also so many great places to take photographs around the property, I simply cannot wait to get my professional photographs back! Additionally, the bridal/groom’s suite were large and immaculate and decked out with huge mirrors/vanities, making it the perfect place to hideout before the ceremony. Thank you SO MUCH to all that keep Whalehead a very special place, especially to Kemberly who really made the day possible.

Beautiful. Incredible. 

Whalehead was hands down the best venue. From the moment I walked the beautiful property, I knew it was the place. Kemberly helped every step of the way. She answered every question I had in a timely manner, which is a HUGE help when planning a destination wedding. You will not be disappointed with this choice!

Wedding of our dreams

The historic Whalehead was an amazing venue for our daughter's wedding. Situated right on the Currituck Sound, you are treated with amazing views and stunning sunsets. This combined with the 1920's mansion that is the Whalehead Club and views of the Corolla Lighthouse provide the perfect, natural backdrop for a dream event. The staff worked hand-in-hand with both us and our wedding planner to create the wedding of our dreams. We will recommend this venue and Kemberly over and over again.
