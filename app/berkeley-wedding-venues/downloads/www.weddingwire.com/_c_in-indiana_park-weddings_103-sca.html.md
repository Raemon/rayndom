We had an outdoors wedding and dinner was delayed an hour...due to the rain. Even with the hour delay the food was absolutely delicious! They make almost everything from scratch and try to use as many as possible locally grown foods. Every time I run in to a guest from our wedding they rave about the food. The Best wedding food ever!!!

Blue Heron is such a unique, beautiful location. We had our wedding last weekend, and it was great! The space outside was the biggest sell for us, and we had one of our favorite photos outside just before sunset. Lexi was very organized and amazing to work with, and we had all our questions answered professionally and thoroughly. We also got the chance to decorate for our own reception (which we preferred, even though they offered to do it for us). The staff at the end was so helpful packing everything inside the car (food, our decorations, gifts), and they even packed two food clamshells for us, labelled MR and MRS for the day after (which were delicious and highly appreciated).

I've worked at Mesker for 4 years and I couldn't imagine some part of my wedding not here. It wasn't big enough for our actual ceremony or reception (we're having 300 people), so I decided I would have my rehearsal dinner here. I've worked countless weddings at the zoo so I am very familiar with our catering staff and my boss is the events coordinator. Needless to say I love these people and if our guest list wasn't so big my big day would be here. It is a gorgeous place to have a wedding. We've had everything from black tie to the most casual of weddings, so having a rehearsal dinner here just seemed right.

There is no other place we would have chosen but here for our perfect day! From the beautiful lake and trees with their fall leaves, to the lodge and beautiful cabins, it was perfect. You can save money on decor because this place is your decor! A beautiful oasis in the woods, surrounded by nature and God. Ryan and Tara Cummings, the caretakers, went above and beyond to meet our needs. They are really cool people and so friendly! The entire staff was great. Our guests stayed the weekend in cabins on the property and we stayed in the couple’s cabin (cabin 5) that had just been renovated and felt like the start to our honeymoon. It was the perfect day.

Hidden Brook Acres was a great place for our wedding! It was very easy, affordable, and I didn't have to worry about hiring bartender. We used a caterer recommended by HB that they had used before and it was incredibly smooth and easy. Honestly, the only thing I really remember about the day is how much fun it was. I never had to get caught up in the logistics of the day. Jeff and Christina are awesome. I definitely recommend Hidden Brook Acres for your wedding.
