MacArthur Park Restaurant in Palo Alto, California, is a historic wedding venue and fine dining spot that specializes in contemporary American fare. Owned and run by seasoned restaurateur Chef Faz Poursohi, it's a destination not to be missed when it comes to delightful culinary experiences and meaningful, memorable "I dos."

**Facilities and Capacity**

With its Colonial Revival styling and homey interiors, MacArthur Park Restaurant is a venue that truly highlights its heritage. Inside, roaring brick hearths flood the dining spaces with an ambient glow, while wainscoting and wooden balconies in white give the rooms a traditional look. When it comes to indoor celebrations, couples have endless opportunities, from the restaurant's private dining rooms to the large, central ballroom and bar, where classic chandeliers cast light upon loved ones as they dine and dance. Just outside sits an enclosed, pergola-covered patio accented by lush greenery and beautiful landscaping. Complete with its own dining furniture and heat lamps, it's ideal for arranging open-air cocktail events or intimate outdoor receptions.
