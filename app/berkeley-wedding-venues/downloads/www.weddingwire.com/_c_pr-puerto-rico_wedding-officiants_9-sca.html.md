Responsible, dedicated, and passionate. Excellent qualities that made him the perfect officiant for our wedding. His words were filled with light, love, and above all, wisdom. He beautifully tailored his speech to our love story, making it even more special. He took the time to meet with us on several occasions to truly get to know us and personalize his words to our union. We feel blessed and fortunate. 100% recommended.

We came to Kendra with what felt like a near-impossible request: pulling off our wedding right after Christmas, on very short notice. From the very first call, she was incredibly positive, calm, professional, and an absolute joy to work with. She met us exactly where we were and guided the process with so much ease that the entire experience felt stress-free. Kendra truly helped bring our vision to life, effortlessly and beautifully. We couldn’t recommend her more highly for your wedding.

Zevio was the officiant for my husband and I's wedding mid November and from the very beginning he was organized and wonderful. He helped us plan our ceremony by drafting it out completely and thoroughly going over everything at our wedding rehearsal. Zevio was responsive, adapting to change and just a pleasure to have. He made everyone laugh during the ceremony, his personalized introduction was perfect. We are so grateful for him. If you hire him as your officiant you will not be disappointed and rest assured your ceremony is in great hands!!!

Desde el primer momento, Cesar y yo nos sentimos acompañados, escuchados y en total confianza. Nuestra ceremonia fue verdaderamente un sueño hecho realidad: religiosa, significativa y llena de amor. Un agradecimiento muy especial a Marilyn, quien nos casó con tanta calidez, sensibilidad y profesionalismo. Sus palabras fueron hermosas, personalizadas y llegaron directo al corazón —no solo al nuestro, sino al de todos los que nos acompañaron. Logró crear un momento mágico que recordaremos por siempre. Gracias por hacer nuestra ceremonia un recuerdo tan especial e inolvidable. Recomendamos a Wedding Ministers Puerto Rico con los ojos cerrados!!

Reverend Santana really made our ceremony extra special. When numerous guest complement your reverand that says a lot. Reverend Santana is very detailed and takes his time with you leading up to the ceremony to make sure everything is perfect. Two nights before the wedding he met up with my husband and I and went over every single part of the Ceremony. He is the missing piece to a perfect ceremony. Even when I told the hotel that I picked him they were happy as they had a soft spot for him. He really makes the ceremony planning seamless and gives you every bit of information that you will need for planning a destination wedding. He is very organized, detailed and punctual. Rev. Santana really made our day special and even my husband friends said our ceremony was something out of a fairytale.

Cory was absolutely the easiest to work with when deciding what to include in our big day and even walked us through what to expect on the day of. From coordination planning to the day at the alter, his energy and motivation that he brought made us even more excited than we already were. From balancing the religious aspect to including the local customs and traditions, Cory made it feel seamless and effortless. He truly brought the ceremony together by including the crowd of family and friends. He was also able to make us feel like we were the only two individuals present during those special moments. 100% would recommend if you want your wedding to feel warm and perfect, choose Cory!

Rev. Ogla is following her passion and it shows. She traveled from Vieques to San Juan for our wedding. On our first phone call, we didn't know what to expect. Rev Ogla took the time and effort to get to know us and put us at ease. From that point, we knew that she was the perfect officiant for us. Everyone remarked how much they enjoyed the ceremony because it was so personalized to us. After the ceremony, Rev Ogla helped us fill out our paperwork for our marriage license from Puerto Rico. I would highly recommend her.

Our celebration was one to remember. Aida Roca made it all so seamless from the beginning to the end. She is prepared with all the steps you need to know from the start, she will guide you through the process, which makes it easier, she is available whenever we needed her, and she performed the most beautiful ceremony for us. We can’t thank her enough for everything she did. Everyone keeps talking about how serene, calm and perfectly Aida performed our ceremony including every detail we wanted. We did not had stress at all with the process because she had it all under control and dis every diligence herself, and a couple of days later we had our Certificate. We recommend Get Married PR if you are looking for an easy and non-stressful process with the most important part of your wedding- the ceremony and legal process. We are very grateful and happy 😊♥️ \- Mariela & Luis
