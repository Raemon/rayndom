Foree films was very easy to work with and made us feel so comfortable. He was very responsive and open to our suggestions and carried them all out in our video. I spent a lot of time watching countless wedding videos and I cried on the first 5 videos I watched from Foree Films and I knew I had to use him! His videos are the perfect mix of sentimental and fun! He was able to capture the most special day of our lives in a way that I am so excited to get to have forever to watch back as a couple but also one day with our kids and family to remember the best day of our lives! I spoke with many videographers and looked at many pricing guides and he is without a doubt the best bang for your buck in the area! Sam Foree is amazing at what he does and his true passion for his craft shows in his work! I would without a doubt book him again for our wedding!

Every part of this video was phenomenal. Not just the turnout but even the day of. Having people we could rely on for our video was relieving. Especially with all the chaos amidst such an important day. They took extra care to make our video feel personal and unique to us. We spent time crafting what we wanted to see and capture and they did it all perfectly. I even wrote the music for the video and Denzel incorporated beautifully! I would recommend this company to anyone.

Austin and Emily Creative are a wonderful team. They were involved in the wedding the whole time getting great shots without being obtrusive or pulling attention from the moment.

We couldn't be happier with our decision to hire Johnathan from Red Knight Video for our wedding! From the first conversation to the final video, he was professional, responsive, and incredibly easy to work with. On the day of the wedding, he blended in seamlessly—capturing all the big moments as well as the little details we didn’t even realize were happening. The final video absolutely blew us away. It was cinematic, emotional, and perfectly told the story of our day. Watching it felt like reliving the wedding all over again. Friends and family have all commented on how beautifully it was done. If you're looking for a wedding videographer who truly cares about getting it right and creating something meaningful, Johnathan is your guy. We highly recommend Red Knight Video—worth every penny!

We had an amazing experience with Muthos Media for my son’s engagement and wedding. Their professionalism and warm demeanor made us feel at ease, resulting in stunning photos/videos that perfectly captured their special day. Muthos Media truly went above and beyond, exceeding our expectations. If you’re seeking someone who is both talented and a joy to work with, we highly recommend Jonny Trego Muthos Media

Jeff worked our wedding a month after I lost my brother unexpectedly. He approached his work with sensitivity and humor, which is hard to express in a succinct review. Trust me when I say that he is a gentleman who will provide top-notch film for you to remember your important occasion!

Hiring Alec as my videographer was one of the best decisions I made for my entire wedding! He made the process so easy (and fun!) from start to finish. I had no idea what I was doing trying to plan a wedding and coordinate with different vendors, and Alec took so much of that stress off me and got in touch with my photographer himself to get a game plan for the wedding day, which I cannot tell you how much I appreciated! He felt like an old friend from the first day I spoke with him and, even though we had never even met in person until the morning of my wedding, felt like part of my wedding party from the moment he arrived. He even somehow managed to persuade my very introverted husband to read a private letter written to me on camera to make our video even more special. If you have the opportunity to hire Bluegrass Imaging for your wedding go ahead and LOCK HIM DOWN! No need to look any further! :)
