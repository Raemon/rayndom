Having my wedding with Peaceful Pointe was an amazing experience! Even my photographer commented on how it lived up to its name, my day was the most perfect and extremely peaceful. The owners are extremely helpful and kind!! All of the facilities were of great use! We really enjoyed getting to have both wedding parties stay the night before the wedding with plenty to do on the grounds and completely separate. I highly encourage the use of this amazing venue. I promise it will surpass, your biggest hopes and dreams in beauty!!

You are not going to find a more breathtaking venue than Legacy Acres in Central Arkansas. The venue is perfect because it can hold your rehearsal dinner, bridal and groom getting ready suites, ceremony, and reception all on one ground. Additionally, the owners and employees of Legacy Acres are the best! They were so helpful when finding other vendors and any planning details. They were also so easy to communicate with. I highly highly recommend Legacy Acres if you’re looking to have an unforgettable wedding day.

My husband and I were completely impressed by Sassafras. We had our wedding and our rehearsal dinner at Sassafras and it went so smoothly with the help of their staff. They were both beautiful evenings and we received so many compliments on the venue. Would highly recommend!

Jennifer and Micki are wonderful to work with!!! They made the planning process so easy and took care of all the little details for us. We were able to show up the day of the rehearsal dinner and wedding with no stress or worries. Their support staff is also top notch…..Katie with the flowers, and all the wait staff and bartenders were great!! Everything turned out beautiful. We would highly recommend Bella Terra Estate!

This venue is absolutely beautiful. It is perfect for an outside rustic wedding. There are beautiful bluffs, trees, several creeks, and acres of green grass.

BoBrook farms is beautiful and a perfect place for a wedding. I had to change wedding plans to an outdoor venue because of COVID- 19 and Karen was super sweet and understanding! Karen, the owner, was very helpful and made the day run smoothly! There is a huge outdoor awning perfect incase inclement weather and the inside of the barn has A/C for hot summer nights. The pictures turned out beautiful and everything went great!
