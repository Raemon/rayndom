## About

In the Santa Clara Valley at the foot of the Santa Cruz Mountains, warm days, cool evenings, and gentle breezes create the perfect climate for vineyards to thrive—and the ideal setting for a sublime wedding.

A third-generation Italian winemaker named Mario knew this place was special when he set foot on it more than 45 years ago, and decided to build his dream winery here. Since then, three more generations have joined the fold, and their love of tradition, fun, wine, and family is evident in the joyful events they host at La Vigna. In fact, you’ll be treated like family by fourth generation Carlo, the winery’s wedding director extraordinaire. He’ll work closely with you from your first consultation until the end of your wedding day, making sure that everything runs smoothly.

The venue sits perched on a rise overlooking the property, offering views of the vine-covered hills in all directions. As guests arrive, they pass through handmade, arched wooden doors into the rustic-chic banquet room, filled with light streaming in through picture windows onto the rich hardwood floor. This beautiful space can host an indoor reception, or serve as a mingling/lounge/cake-cutting area for outdoor events. French doors open to the expansive patio, where al fresco weddings take place—including ceremonies in a lovely spot framed by vineyards and oak trees.

Acres of lush vineyards provide the backdrop as you step onto the raised deck to exchange vows. Here, you’re sheltered by a graceful, intricately-scrolled wrought-iron arch that’s pretty on its own, but is even more eye-catching when draped with flowers or fabric.

Following your vows, guests will be served from the custom barrel bar. As the party’s getting started, you might want to sneak away to snap some great photos—why not steal a kiss among the vines, pose next to stacked barrels, or hop up on the cute antique flatbed truck!

Your reception is held on the patio, which is largely shaded by a permanent white canopy. Throughout the evening, family and friends can move between the banquet room and open-air areas, lending the celebration a wonderful indoor-outdoor flow.

The experienced staff excels at creating “turnkey” packages tailored to each couple. They love taking care of all the details, but if you want to bring in some of your own vendors they’re fine with that, too. La Vigna is also one of the most affordable venues in the Santa Clara Valley, and they take pride in accommodating both your needs and your budget. While you’re prepping in your plush, secluded bridal suite, you’ll be able to relax, confident that the coordination of your event is in excellent hands.

Once you’ve settled on a menu (created in-house or by one of their recommended caterers), the house sommelier will suggest pairings with their award-winning Italian-style wines—Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Chianti, Carignane, and more—which are all organically and sustainably grown in the Old World dry-farming tradition. So as you raise a glass, you’ll know you’re toasting with something truly special. _Salud!_

Great experience getting married here!

We got married here in September 2021. We have nothing but good things to say about the venue and about Carlo the venue owner, who was incredibly helpful every step of the way.  
  
When you book this venue, you also get Carlo as your day-of coordinator! This ended up being a tremendous help to us. We got to enjoy our wedding day without worrying about logistics, and he made sure everything went off without a hitch.   
  
All our guests couldn't stop raving about how beautiful the venue and wedding were.   
  
Working with Carlo was a breeze, he was very responsive and helpful - you can tell he knows what he's talking about, he knows the wedding industry inside and out. We really enjoyed working with him the whole way, he provided so much valuable knowledge and was extremely flexible with us.  
  
Highly recommend this venue to any couple!

Beautiful location & amazing service

We have had to reschedule & redesign our wedding several times due to COVID since originally signing our contract and the owner/event coordinator Carlo has been amazing! He was incredibly flexible with date changes and helped us organize a beautiful private elopement during the quarantine, paying attention to even the smallest details to ensure that our special day was still special even it was just the two of us and our witnesses. The location is gorgeous and the vineyards make for beautiful wedding photos. As we continue to plan for our reception with friends and family when things reopen, we love that Carlo makes the planning process simple by taking care of the catering and keeping a vast array of decor in house so we don’t need to worry about finding a lot of outside vendors.

Carlo and his staff were amazing. Carlo is not a wedding mill. Carlo is a hands on one at a time wedding superman. I felt we received a venue and a coordinator all I'm one. He led us thru the entire process with the enthusiasm, friendliness and availability you would hope for in an venue owner. Yes owner! It is a small family run vineyard sweet and quaint with a capacity of about 250. Carlo takes great pride in his work and it is apparent in the quality of the outcome.  
I want to thank Carlo and his beautiful friendly staff for making that special day amazing.

Everything was perfect from the food to the tables and the beautiful vineyard in the background. Carlo helped us plan everything from the big ideas to the little details. He guided us when we had no clue what to do. He was also very friendly and flexible during those last minute questions and planning.   
  
Our wedding day exceeded our expectations and we couldn't be happier!

Carlo and his crew were wonderful to work with. We had some special requests and he made them happen. The site was just as wonderful. The setting at La Vigna is very private and intimate.
