As a local wedding planner, Delilah's Flower Shoppe has been my GO-TO. The flexibility, creativeness, and excitement that comes from Delilah's team makes it a breeze for me and my clients. They can do it all! Ceiling installs, personal flowers, centerpieces, arches or any kind - you will not be disappointed with the quality work. I attached a few photos of some of the work they've done for my clients/ They will take any vision board and make it come to life! Highly recommend!

We wanted a unique autumn theme for our wedding, and the pampas grass arrangements were absolutely breathtaking. The combination of the airy pampas and elegant glass decor created such a sophisticated and warm atmosphere. The team was professional and met our budget needs perfectly. It was the dreamiest fall wedding!

We used Carlson as our florist , and knew they did phenomenal work because they did my sister’s wedding, but I still couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw the bouquets and then the floral arrangements at our venue. They took my vision and executed better than I ever could have hoped. They truly transformed the room. I can’t recommend them highly enough.

A reliable vendor with reasonable prices. We sent pictures of what we had in mind and they created almost exact replicas of what we were thinking. Gorgeous bouquets and displays!

As the mother of the bride, I had the joy of working closely with Raven and Maria throughout the planning process, and I cannot say enough about how extraordinary the florals were for my daughter’s wedding. Every detail was beyond beautiful and truly unforgettable. The ceremony was graced with two magnificent urns overflowing with white roses and delicate ranunculus, creating the most elegant backdrop for the vows. It was breathtaking and set exactly the tone we had hoped for. The reception design was nothing short of magical. The tables were adorned with low compote florals, perfectly styled to complement the space. Gold candlesticks of varying heights, each with glass globes over white candles, cast the most romantic glow throughout the room. The addition of crystal votive holders and Monet stem holders with floating candles layered even more light and sparkle — it was absolutely enchanting. Our guests could not stop commenting on how stunning the room looked, and it was all thanks to Kato’s artistry, vision, and attention to detail. Working with Kato Floral Design was an absolute pleasure, and the end result exceeded every expectation. I wholeheartedly recommend Kato Floral Designs to anyone planning a wedding or special event — their work is truly exceptional.

Natalie and her team are the absolute best! Couldn’t have asked for a better team to work with for planning our wedding day. She is so professional and extremely organized with all of her communication with couples from when you book to wedding day. She truly cares about making your wedding day the best day down to the last detail – even making sure the bride and groom have time to eat! The florals on our wedding day were so stunning! Even though we didn’t have a very specific vision for our arrangements, I had full trust that she would make them look magical and they were! Her team is so talented but what differentiates them the most is their genuine care for all of the couples – they truly made our day unforgettable and couldn’t recommend them more!!

As a native of Savannah, I have always known and loved the work of John Davis Florist. When it was time to plan the flowers for my small wedding, I knew exactly who I wanted to use. They listened to my ideas and what I wanted and treated my small order with the same attention to detail and respect of a big wedding. My flowers were beautiful, fresh and exactly what I wanted.

We were recommended this florist by the events manager at the River Street Inn, and I'm so grateful we went with A to Zinnias! We left florals to the last minute a bit, but Kat and her team were able to get me a quote for florals so quickly, and it was everything I imagined it would be and more! My bouquet was stunning, the floral order was perfect, and everything arrived on time or ahead of schedule. The arrangements we had for the ceremony might be the prettiest flowers I've ever seen. Kat took what little I had to provide inspiration wise, and ran with it to create such a beautiful floral experience the day of. I can't recommend A to Zinnias enough!!
