Rev Mel was very kind in our initial FaceTime and extremely responsive via email any time I had a question as our wedding day approached. There was a traffic incident that caused him to be right on time which meant we started our ceremony about 15 minutes late. In the end it was lucky as had we started on time, a very loud train would have been going by and would have interrupted the ceremony. On a hot day out door wedding coupled with traffic drama Mel still came through for us and delivered the ceremony just as intended and the wedding ended up being just so beautiful and perfect! Things happen and I really appreciated him calling my MOH on the road to keep her informed. He’s very kind and energetic and genuinely seems to love what he does and that is why we chose him. He also brought fun ideas to the table for our ceremony which resulted in a special moment for our moms that neither of us would have thought up on our own. Thanks Mel!!!!

Wendy officiated our wedding this past summer and we were thrilled with her services! She was extremely professional throughout the entire process, from planning through the day of, and she even took care of filing our marriage license so we could just focus on celebrating. We had an initial phone call where we got to know her, and she learned about us and our story. Then when we got closer to the day of, she sent us a draft of the ceremony that we could edit and add to so that we could make it our own. She was on time and well-prepared on the day of, and the ceremony went extremely smoothly. We would HIGHLY recommend Wendy to anyone who is looking for a professional officiant who takes care of all the details on your big day!

Theresa officiated our wedding and did a wonderful job. She created a beautiful and fun ceremony that incorporated an extended version of our love story and kept the audience interacting. It gave us such peace of mind to have her there on the big day. Her public speaking skills are perfect and she did mic checks to make sure everything would be just right at the ceremony. At the rehearsal, she helped with lots of little details - where to stand, how to hand off the bouquet, the exchanging of rings - that made everything run so smoothly day-of. After the ceremony, she knew exactly what to do for the marriage license. We were so grateful we had her on our vendor team!

We were married back in 2021 (I realized we didn’t leave a review!), and Loretta made our ceremony incredibly special! We actually hired another officiant at first, but after he canceled and gave our appointment to a friend of his (who was a bit rude over emails), we went looking for someone else. We came across Loretta, and she seemed like the perfect fit. She asked us to pick out one of her scripts from her website, and we picked one that we really liked. The officiant we had before used a basic script that he didn’t write himself, and we had to edit it a lot to fit our (lack of) spiritual beliefs. Loretta’s was perfect from the get-go. Fast forward to our wedding day, Loretta was incredibly sweet, thoughtful and all around wonderful. The script that we had already read sounded so incredibly different coming from Loretta’s mouth. It was beautiful spoken, we both teared up as we listened to her words and looked in each others eyes. It was a transcendent experience. To make a long story short, you will absolutely not be disappointed in Loretta. It was such an experience that we often bring it up, even 2 years later! Thank you so much Loretta, you made our ceremony so special!

The Wedding Officiant is a beacon of kindness, compassion, peace, stillness, and HUMOUR in this do too much time. I have been wanting to attend her Friendship Retreat for over a decade, and am still savoring the experience months later. I can’t wait to attend another one of her retreats!

We were lucky enough to be referred to Anthony. It was a pleasant experience from start to finish. The communication was prompt and very informative. His advice and suggestions were very helpful. They were flexible with scheduling. We wanted a pretty informal marriage signing, and ended up choosing a cafe that was meaningful to us. Anthony and Emily met us there before the scheduled time, and made the process so easy and enjoyable. We loved sitting and talking with them. And when we have a bigger, more public ceremony, we 100% plan to hire them again.
