From start to finish working with Linsey (Compound Press) was an absolute dream. I genuinely enjoyed every second of time/effort/thought that went into the design process... and that is entirely attributable to Linsey's professionalism, expertise, talent, and attention to detail. She allows space for the client's creativity/vision and then brings it to life. We went through several design iterations (due to my indecisiveness) and every time she delivered. Our final invitations were truly a work of art! Will be using Linsey for all of our future design/invitation needs. 10/10 recommend!!!

We worked with The Dandelion Patch to design and produce a gorgeous invitation suite and day-of paper, with beautiful hand calligraphy to match, for our fall 2024 DC wedding. Owner and designer Jill was responsive, incredibly patient, and easy to work with and really helped us walk through our different design options. She has a terrific creative flair and suggested some beautiful options for pulling our invitations together with the right font, color, and presentation. The entire suite was incredibly elegant and matched our wedding space and design perfectly. We were delighted with the services provided by The Dandelion Patch, and Jill’s help made our event that much more stunning.

We ordered invitations and samples from this company. The samples took awhile for us to get it (2 weeks, I think. It seemed a crazy amount of time since we live so close), but they were free as advertised. The samples also don't have tracking numbers on them, which means that the workers at Exclusively Weddings couldn't tell us how long it would take. The invitations, on the other hand, was a much better experience. The editing tool wasn't hard to use and we got exactly what we were looking for. Not to mention, the price was fantastic. Since the invitations themselves had tracking numbers, we were able to anticipate exactly when we would get them. I would probably recommend this service if you have enough time to get the samples then the invitations (since they also send coupons you can use to bring the cost of the invitation order down).

My experience with Haute Papier was fantastic! They created custom save the dates, and wedding invitations for us, in addition to menus and programs for the day of. My daily contact was Julie, she was so helpful and I think really understood my vision and what kind of look and feel we were going for. They created really unique stationary for us that brought personal elements in and reflected the tropical, yet classic wedding we were having. Haute Papier is not inexpensive, but for the quality of the product, level of detail, and amount of attention they pay to making your wedding unique and tailored exactly towards your needs and tastes, it was totally worth it. We got so many complements when people received their invitations in the mail, and the theme of the invitations matched PERFECTLY with our decor, venue etc. I found a new passion for letterpress and all things paper working with them for my wedding needs. A truly fun, and enjoyable experience! We also ordered Thank You Notes from HP, and I plan on ordering personal stationary with my new monogram soon!
