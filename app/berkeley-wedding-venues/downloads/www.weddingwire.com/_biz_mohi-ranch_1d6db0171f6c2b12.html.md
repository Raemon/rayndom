Our perfect wedding at MOHI Ranch

From the moment we first toured MOHI Ranch, we knew we had found the perfect venue for our wedding day. Looking back, we can honestly say that the entire experience, from initial planning to the final send-off, exceeded every expectation.  
  
The setting itself is simply magical. We had our ceremony in the vineyard with the olive tree aisle and it was perfect. Even in early November, the vines were lush with slight Fall tones. The outdoor reception under the olive trees and lights felt like a scene from a movie—it’s naturally gorgeous and requires very little added decor. As the sun set, the entire winery transformed under the twinkling bistro lights. This feature alone creates such a romantic and special atmosphere that guests are still raving about.  
  
A massive part of our success was our coordinator, Danika. She was absolutely fantastic! Danika walked us through the entire process with expertise, kept us perfectly on track with our timeline, and answered every single one of our questions (no matter how small or frequent).  
  
The planning process was seamless, enhanced by the specialized services MOHI provides. We were thrilled to use the design service through Lux Designs, which helped us finalize our vision for decor. The tasting menu experience was also wonderful, allowing us to confidently choose our menu while enjoying a date night out. The food was fantastic! We received countless compliments from our guests, who told us how much they enjoyed every dish. The quality and presentation were superb, and there was plenty for everyone.  
  
If you are looking for a venue that combines natural elegance, exceptional service, and delicious catering, look no further than MOHI Ranch. They gave us the most special and memorable day of our lives!

Our wedding Day

Our wedding with MOHI was exceptional. From the beginning consultation and tour to the end I really did not have to worry about one detail. The process was so easy we were able to enjoy being engaged. Danika Del Monte, our coordinator, walked us through everything the weeks leading up to the wedding and handled the actual day flawlessly. I have no other words besides the day was perfect. Our guests are still talking about the venue and the wedding. We also appreciated Eduardo and all of his help coordinating the facilities on the day of!

Fantastic wedding venue!

I’ve been a wedding photographer for 15 years, and Mohi Ranch is truly one of the best venues I’ve had the pleasure to work at. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous, with so many stunning spots for photos—it’s a dream for both couples and photographers.  
  
Danika, the coordinator, is outstanding. She’s professional, organized, and makes the day flow so smoothly, which allows everyone (vendors and couples alike) to just enjoy the experience.  
  
If you’re looking for a beautiful venue with an exceptional team, I can’t recommend Mohi Ranch highly enough!

Beautiful Wedding Venue with Professional Operations Team

After touring MOHI Ranch, my husband and I instantly knew it was the perfect venue for us. The gorgeous fountain at the entrance and the breathtaking olive tree aisle immediately stood out. The ceremony space is clean, simply beautiful, and spacious—ideal for creating a truly memorable atmosphere.  
  
One of my favorite aspects was the convenience of having both our ceremony and reception in one central location. This made logistics so much simpler for us and far more comfortable for our guests.  
  
We visited about four other venues before discovering MOHI Ranch, but none matched the simple, romantic ambiance we found here. There’s ample parking for a 200+ person wedding, but our guest list was closer to 100, which felt just right—cozy and intimate, but never cramped. Our guests raved about the food and cocktails, which made the celebration even more special.  
  
A special shoutout to DJ Darren, who was incredible at hyping up the atmosphere and engaging our guests in every celebratory moment.  
  
The wedding planning and décor teams were also incredibly professional. It’s clear they have a well-oiled operation and a wealth of experience, which made the entire process smooth and stress-free.  
  
We truly couldn’t have asked for a better venue or a more seamless experience!

We had an amazing wedding at Mohi Ranch

The team was easy to work with and very flexible. It was looking like it would stop raining before our ceremony was scheduled to begin, but as we got closer to the start, we realized it wouldn't let off in time. The team was able to help shuffle things around and move the outdoor ceremony to after the the cocktail hour, which worked out amazingly well. The sun was shining after the cocktail hour and we had a great ceremony outdoors. Everyone was great to work with from the DJ, to the staff, to the wedding coordinator. We would highly recommend Mohi Ranch for your wedding venue.

Beautiful venue, great coordination and decor team, delicious food!

We are so happy we chose Mohi Ranch (formerly Mohi Wine) as our wedding venue! The beautiful indoor & outdoor spaces, especially the olive trees everywhere, along with the 'mostly-inclusive' concept is what drew us in initially. (We only had to provide our own photo/video, dessert, and personal signage/decor).  
  
The in-house coordination team and design/decor/floral team were great to work with. They were very responsive, flexible to accommodate some cultural aspects of our wedding, and their familiarity with the venue left no questions unanswered. They also performed the day-of coordination duties, and the day went SO smoothly – it couldn't have been planned any better!  
  
The food was also really good, and got plenty of compliments on it from our guests as well. We upgraded to the Premium menu, with seared sea bass and roasted filet mignon as our entrees, and had it served family style. (Actually good, not just "good for a wedding".)  
  
Some other thoughts...  
\- The initial quote they gave us was pretty spot-on (yay transparent pricing!).  
\- The bridal suite is on the smaller side, but it does have its own bathroom.  
\- We had our ceremony and cocktail hour outside, and reception indoors in the barrel room.  
\- Plenty of parking

absolutely the best

Every last penny we spent was well worth it. We had an absolutely beautiful wedding and really don’t think it could have been the same without MOHI as our venue. Since your design, catering, and bar is in house it takes away so much stress of finding people to do those things. They also have coordinators that help guide you with planning! They are all amazing and know what they are doing. The staff is also more than amazing and are there to help you and your guest have a magical day!

Venue of our dreams!!

We selected Mohi Wine for our wedding on October 27, 2023. Best decision we could've possibly made! Everything was impeccable and we received so many compliments from our guests on the decor (by Savannah at Deluxe Design Decor), food, staff, and ambiance. It was literally a DREAM WEDDING!! I cannot thank our coordinator CHRISTINA enough!! When I say she went above and beyond throughout the entire process, I truly mean it! And the decor by Savannah was absolutely perfect!! Thank you, Christina and Savannah and thank you Mohi Wine!!

Everything we expected, and more!

We recently had the most incredible wedding at MoHi Wine on June 24 and can't recommend them enough! From the moment we toured the venue back in January 2022, we knew it was the perfect place for our special day.  
  
The team at MoHi, especially Christina, provided exceptional service from day one. I can't emphasize enough how stress-free the day felt for us because she was so on top of everything! Christina guided us through every step, ensuring that our wedding day was everything we dreamed of. Her attention to detail, personal touch, and genuinely fun personality made us feel valued and taken care of throughout the process. Day-of, she went above and beyond--including bringing chairs and waters during our wedding party photos, reserving ceremony chairs on short notice, driving the golf cart for transportation, delivering plates to tables, and inviting us to an after-party downtown!  
  
The venue itself is nothing short of breathtaking. The beautiful outdoor setting against the quiet hills and vineyard created a romantic ambiance, perfect for a wedding! The long aisle down the corridor of olive trees is gorgeous for any bride and bridal party to make their way down. The cocktail hour on the patio is great for entertaining with spaces for sun, shade, games, and personal touches. The barrel room for the reception is just as beautiful- with the twinkly lights and modern light fixtures. We added a photobooth, dessert table, 15 tables, plus a sweetheart table and nothing felt too tight. "Stunning" was a compliment we kept hearing from guests. If you get married here, you'll work with Design Deluxe Decor for everything related to floral and table decor.   
  
Now let's talk about the food. The culinary experience at MoHi Wine was outstanding. The vegetable risotto was a particular hit. The menu offered a great variety, including accommodations for dairy free, gluten free, and vegetarian. And we appreciated the grand testing a few months before where we had huge portions to sample the appetizers, drinks, and courses. The quality of the food--along with the attentive staff who tried to get food out as efficiently as they could--was impressive, especially for 160 guests.  
  
Last but not least, the party was off the charts, thanks to the incredible DJ Darren. He sent us a very thorough questionnaire ahead of time so we had full trust that we were on the same page. He knew exactly how to keep the energy high and the dance floor packed, was flexible with timeline changes, and had everyone (from 2 year olds to 90 year olds) grooving.  
  
As far as critiques, I would say that I wished the barrel room bathrooms were located in a different area because they did crowd. Though available and open, the outdoor portables were underutilized and too far away. I also wish the bridal suite was larger because it's not a place where anyone can truly get ready in. More of a touchdown area with AC (a plus!) which the bridal party used pre-ceremony. I heard this is on their remodel list.  
  
If you're looking for a remarkable wedding venue, look no further than MoHi Winery. The exceptional team, led by Christina, will go above and beyond to make your day truly special. With a beautiful venue, delectable food, and an amazing party atmosphere, MoHi Winery is the perfect choice for an unforgettable wedding experience.

Absolutely Impressive - So grateful for the MOHI Team!

This venue checked all of the boxes for us but what we were just so impressed by was how responsive they were, how knowledgeable they were, how seamless the whole process was and, even on the day of the wedding (hottest day in April at 90 degrees), they ensured my husband and I were always hydrated and coordinated everything to the T! I cannot stop raving about this venue and no doubt I would recommend them to my closest friends getting married soon.  
  
One more thing we LOVED and made this venue stand out was how all-inclusive it was, from venue, to catering, to drinks, to service, to decor! It made it so easy for us and we knew exactly our budget going in to it.
