My daughter and son in law's wedding parties, family and wedding guests stayed at the Marriott San Jose, and had such a pleasant experience! We worked closely with Alyssa and Gig, who helped coordinate block rooms, day after brunch, welcome bags for the guests upon their arrival, all the way down to having special goodies in the bride and groom's rooms when they first got there. We were warmly greeted by valet and front desk, and everyone was so helpful with the day after brunch in Arcadia! I would definitely recommend this hotel and their fine staff!

Gigi and Rebecca were awesome to work with! All the staff was so pleasant and respectful to our guests at our wedding. My husband and I loved how updated the interior decor was and the rooftop lounge area that we were able to host our farewell brunch at. We would definitely recommend this venue for hosting weddings and receptions!

70th Birthday Party  
After having decided to celebrate my milestone birthday at the Marriott, Downtown San Jose, this was the beginning of a delightful journey. My event planners, whom I recommend 100%, Gigi and Rebecca were superior in their desire to make this the best day of my life. Having experienced my personality, Gigi took me to the 26th floor to the Concierge Lounge and attached outdoor Patio. This is where you should have your party. Your guests can dance “under the stars”, and come inside for the food, and birthday program. I loved it, immediately.   
We were invited to a tasting for the food, I selected the Southern Goodness menu, which came with 9 items and 2 desserts. My guests thoroughly enjoyed the food and couldn’t believe this was prepared by the hotel, it was so good. Shout out to the Chef. She was amazing.   
The staff was so accommodating the entire evening, from the set-up of the dancing stage, TV for the slide show, bartender, to the food service staff, and food presentation. The entire evening, I felt like a Princess. I also received a Suite, located on same floor as party, with a thank you gift waiting for me at check-in. Thank you Marriott for the best birthday party ever.

This review is to give credit to the San Jose Marriott and their care toward our wedding. My husband and I decided to host our wedding with the San Jose Marriott, not only for their layout but also for the competent and kindness of their entire staff. During our search for a venue, we came to realize that the quality we were looking for was not only determined for the beauty of a space but the team which would help assemble our wedding day. The Marriott team was not only bright but also extremely kind. We knew that their team would assist in executing the type of wedding we envisioned. Gigi was our first point of contact, she was amazing to work with!  
  
Other than that, other factors that informed our decision was their wedding packages, which was complete with wine at dinner, an excellent outside wedding cake vendor and a complete cocktail hour. Their food is prepared and suggested by their kitchen staff at the world renowned Arcadia, where my wedding guests also dined, the night before and the morning after our wedding reception.   
  
Some of the highlights of my wedding weekend:  
The ease of our guests getting to the hotel and to our church (50% of our guest were from out of town)  
The support up until the wedding week from their staff on adjusting our guest reservations  
A trendy bar to host and entertain our guests the night before the wedding while we were away at the rehearsal dinner. We joined them after and the location made it very easy to return to our rooms.  
A nice all inclusive, Sunday brunch of $25 at Arcadia. They also have multiple private rooms within this restaurant to reserve for your guest and to open gifts.  
Adjustments and request were accommodated with kindness by their staff throughout our collaboration with them  
Their decorations vendor was excellent (this is only an option if you would like a specific look)

I can't believe I overlooked writing this review!! We celebrated our 10 year anniversary by renewing our vows (the whole church & reception) & we decided to choose the Marriott as our venue as our first meeting with Gigi was a great experience. We met a few times & exchanged multiple e-mails before we finally signed our event contract. We were then handed over to Rita who became our event coordinator. Rita, by far, was always accommodating, very responsive, on top of things, super friendly, and just an overall JOY to work with. She made this whole planning process effortless.  
  
From the valet to the front desk, the wait staff during our event & the housekeeping ladies, everyone provided service that was always 100%.  
  
Thank you San Jose Marriott! I can't wait to plan another event or convince my husband we need a "staycation". We absolutely love this hotel & it's staff!
