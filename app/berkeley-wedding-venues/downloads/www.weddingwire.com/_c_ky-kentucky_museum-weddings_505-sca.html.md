I can’t speak highly enough of the Kentucky Derby Museum for helping me with the wedding of my dreams. The event space has been updated in the recent years and has made it a elite experience. Nothing is more iconic than I’m getting married in Kentucky at Churchill Downs but with the history of the museum. A lot of of our guests were out of town and it really got them to experience and appreciate the history of Kentucky. I can’t speak Kylie enough about working with Maddy. She made the experience amazing, answered all my emails in a timely manner accommodating to all my rrequest! I wish I could work with her all the time!

We booked the Schweinfurth house to host our Saturday afternoon baby shower of about 30 guests. Thanks to Cedarhurst for providing such a beautiful space for us to use right here conveniently in Mount Vernon. Everything was unlocked and ready to go and clean and nice upon arrival. We really needed only the minimal decorations we brought with us as the space can hold its own already. The chairs and tables and rental linens (which didn’t have one wrinkle) already setup made it so much easier for us coming in to decorate beforehand, as well as the ease of not having to deal with a long chore list for clean up afterwards. And we appreciate so much the extra generous hours provided for setting up and then packing up afterwards. We never felt rushed or stressed due to this! Would highly recommend!

If you don't want to spend money on decorations for your ceremony, want beautiful pictures, and you are on a budget... this is the place for you! We had our ceremony if front of the fountain and it was beautiful. They set up chairs how we wanted and little to no decorations were needed. We got a quartet and our officiant and it was perfect! They also have a HUGE (and beautiful) bridal suite (which has its own private side door) to get ready in!

This venue is one of the most beautiful venue I looked at in Paducah KY. It's located by the river in downtown Paducah with great views for pictures. The rooms are very beautifully decorated.

We booked the KY Science Center for our 2021 wedding then ended up eloping in NC this summer. But I want to state how amazing Jamie and the events team were in helping us book the venue. Due to COVID, we weren’t able to view the event space in person. Jamie talked me through all the details and answered all my questions, and I really appreciate the time she took leading up to my decision to book. As soon as staff could get into the museum, they took a video of the space so I could see it. The customer service was amazing!
