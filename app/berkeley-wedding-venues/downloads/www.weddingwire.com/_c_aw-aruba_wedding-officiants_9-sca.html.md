We had the perfect vow renewal ceremony on our 30th anniversary with this company and Reverend Croes! When setting things up, our inquiries were answered in a timely manner and included all the information we needed to plan our memorable day! Reverand Croes helped us stay within our budget and he listened to what our wishes were and did not pressure us into including things in our ceremony that we didn’t want. He let us know all the options and then let us choose exactly how we wanted our day to look. The actual ceremony was so beautiful!! He was sure to include our daughters in the service, even having them sign the bow renewal certificate. Reverend Croes’ words during the ceremony were beautiful and sincere. Everything went exactly as we had hoped! We have such special memories of our special day. I would highly recommend Reverend Croes to anyone looking for a vow renewal in Aruba!
