I haven't heard all good reviews about DestinationWeddings.com however we had a great experience. After weeks of researching on my own I came across their website and figured it wouldn't hurt to submit my info. I was getting nowhere on my own! Soon after my submission I was contacted by the wonderful Susan Robson! From our very first conversation it was as if a weight was lifted off my shoulders. Susan helped guide me through everything from picking a resort to how to work with my wedding coordinator. She told me what to expect every step of the way. Without her I probably would have passed on what turned out to be my dream wedding! She helped with getting tons of comps and setting up a room block. She got great rates for our group. All of my guests enjoyed booking with her. I know they weren't the easiest to work with but Susan handled it all with so much patience and professionalism. I would highly recommend Susan to any of my friends and family.

Mrs. Lori is AMAZING! She really put A LOT of time & effort to make sure we had the best deals possible. I’ve booked trips on my own before. I seem to always mess up somewhere. Lori makes sure that everything is in perfect order before you even pack your bags!

What a Great experience!! Our wedding was a wonderful success thanks in great part to Condo Hotel Marketplace. With one call we were given a range of options to choose from for our wedding location. All within our price range and on top of they were able to accommodate several special requests we made to make our trip stand out as special to our guests. We had a large group to arrange travel for, many from other cities, and everyone made it without any troubles. Condo Hotel Marketplace arranged our transportation needs (complete with special drink requests). It was very comforting to know all my guests had to do was contact Leslie and she took care of all their needs and we did not have to worry about anyone but ourselves. From passport reminders to travel updates it could not have gone smoother. Thanks for all you did for us !!! Doug and Wendy Weck Wedding location: Dreams Punta Cana

I Used Christy @ Classic Travel and Cruises to help plan my destination wedding May 2016. I couldn't' have asked for a better travel agent. She helped me with every aspect of the trip. When we went down for the wedding we ran into some issues with the space and even though she herself was on vacation she went above and beyond to help. She reached out to all her contacts and helped us resolve the issue. All 32 of our guests loved her. She really helped me stay organized and up to speed with all of our guests. I will be using her and referring her for any travel from here on out.
