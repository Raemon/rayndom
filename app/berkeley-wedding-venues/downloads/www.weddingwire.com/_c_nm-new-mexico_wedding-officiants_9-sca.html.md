Brian was the perfect officiant for our elopement! From the start, he was incredibly kind, patient, and easy to talk to. He took the time to get to know us beforehand, asking thoughtful questions and listening closely to our story so he could craft a ceremony that truly reflected who we are as a couple. The ceremony he delivered was heartfelt, personal, and beautifully written. It felt so genuine and intimate—exactly what we wanted for our elopement. Brian’s warmth and professionalism helped make the day even more special. We’re so grateful to have had him be a part of such an important moment in our lives. Highly recommend!

We cannot exaggerate how wonderful ChrisTina was to work with. She was focused and thorough, but always human and in touch. We were seeking an "elopement" (that is, no guests; just the two of us) for what was the second wedding for both of us and we really wanted it to be meaningful to and memorable for us. ChrisTina created a ceremony that attained these goals completely. She interviewed both of us separately and together, and had each of us complete a fairly intensive but valuable questionnaire. Through these interactions, she got to know us as individuals and as a couple, understanding who we were and why we were (and wanted to be) together. And the ceremony she created could not have reflected that any better. We were married in Santa Fe's beautiful botanical garden on partly cloudy, blustery day in the early fall. The words ChrisTina said and beautiful altar and rituals she crafted were like a mirror reflecting back to us the couple we had become and hoped to be. ChrisTina was amazing, period. Our recommendation of her is strong and unhesitating.

Patsy was an amazing officiant! She made sure each detail we wanted was included and during rehearsal was very helpful in getting everyone on the same page. Everything went so smooth and we are forever grateful!

We absolutely loved Father David! Communication was wonderful, everything went smoothly! Our ceremony was in Santa Fe and he was more than happy to travel from Albuquerque. As Catholics getting married at the Loretto Chapel, a Former Catholic Church now a Museum, we wanted our ceremony as close to a full mass as possible and he helped us make that happen. He was so great! Highly highly recommend him for whatever needs you may have!

Laurie's personal touch and sincerity made our ceremony incredible. She really took the time to get to know us and worked to ensure every word was exactly what we wanted. Many of our guests commented to us how nice the ceremony was. Laurie is is adventurous and willing to do just about anything and go anywhere to marry couples. We had a fairly traditional ceremony, but I know Laurie hiked 6 miles with a couple to marry them in a beautiful remote ceremony where it was just the 3 of them. I would recommend Laurie to any couple looking for the right officiant! Be sure to check out her site or give her a call.

Linda is a kind, caring person she did our private wedding a few years ago and did a wonderful job. She was one of the few Officiate we could find that was non judgmental and very understanding. Thank you so much Linda for the beautiful ceremony. Mr. and Mrs. Julian Mitchell.

Rev. Susan was just who we were looking for, a kind and spiritual person who just wanted to do the kind of ceremony that would make US happy. We came a long way for this wedding [from Chicago] but it was so worth it! Krystyna & Will
