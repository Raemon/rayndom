The best wedding 

Our wedding at Colvin House was everything we could have dreamed of and more. The venue is absolutely stunning, with its unique character, beautiful spaces, and the breathtaking chandelier that added such a magical touch. We had our outdoor ceremony in the courtyard, and it couldn’t have been more perfect – the setting was beautiful, and it felt intimate and special. The team, especially Sara and Laura, were amazing planners who ensured that everything went smoothly and helped bring our vision to life. From the incredible charm of the venue to the attention to detail provided by the staff, Colvin House was the ideal place for our wedding. Our guests couldn’t stop complimenting the beauty of the space, and we are so grateful to have celebrated our special day there. We highly recommend Colvin House for anyone looking for a venue that combines elegance with charm!

The Perfect Microwedding

We got married on 1/18/2025. Originally, we were going to do a courthouse, but I wanted to see if a micro wedding was a possibility. The Colvin house fell into our lap. We visited on 12/23, booked on 12/27 and got married 1/18. The package we had was all inclusive and helped us with decor and florals and food. Sarah was so easy to work with and made us feel confident and excited for our wedding. The day was so beautiful. From the decor to the food, to the florals and set up. It was a great time and we got so many compliments for the venue. I would highly recommend the colvin house, especially if you are having a smaller wedding. the venue is bigger than it seems but perfect for an intimate wedding. We got married in winter, but I could only imagine how beautiful it would of been if we couldve gotten married in the spring, summer or fall. Book the colvin house, you wont regret it!

Colvin house is a dream

Colvin House was a dream. The venue is so cool and exactly the vibe we were going for. It’s right off Lake Michigan and we were able to do some photos out there during our cocktail hour and they turned out amazing. The outdoor space is huge enough for seating 100 comfortable with space for an epic dance party. The inside “garage” spot is perfect for serving up drinks to guests as well as the front of the house where guests can enjoy drinks and play outdoor games! It’s absolutely beautiful at night with all of the strung lights and just sets a great mood. On top of that, you get to work with Sarah and Laura who are absolute rock stars. Sarah was so eager to do every little detail we wanted and was so excited every time we spoke. We probably sent over 100s of different photos of the style we were trying to go for and Sarah nailed every.single.one. She really put her heart and soul into our big day! She was such a pleasure to work with. Laura was an amazing day of planner and helped us so much during the last few weeks to the day. I’m not sure we would have been able to do everything we wanted without her all-out effort. The wedding turned out wonderful and we are just so thankful to have had them for it.

Truly outstanding!

It was such a pleasure to work within the historic, gorgeous, newly renovated Colvin House! This venue is the perfect site for an intimate wedding ceremony, and reception, while providing ample space for guests to spread out between the two floors and handsome brick laid courtyard perfectly accented with strung lights to enjoy cocktails, hors d'oeuvres, and dinner. There are so many wonderful chair, table, bar set-up options throughout the premises to not only accommodate guest, catering, and DJ needs, but exceed any bride or groom’s vision for their big day. The captivating interior design and architecture throughout open up a whole new realm to capture breathtaking photo ops (every bride’s fav!) – from the cozy, upstairs bridal suite with balcony windows to let in natural lighting to the main hardwood floor staircase winding down beneath their radiant signature chandelier to the courtyard with enough space to provide plenty of room to dance, and just steps away from Lake Michigan for an elegant and romantic background setting of the waves or Chicago skyline. Amelia and Laura (events/management) were incredible to work beside, as they were noticeably attentive to the bride and groom’s needs, their family members, and fellow hired employees throughout the night. The event ran smoothly from beginning to end, and we certainly can’t wait for another opportunity to work with them in the future! Highly recommend!

Winter wedding at the Colvin House

The Colvin House was a beautiful and affordable venue to host our wedding. We loved the architecture of the house and the proximity to the lake and city. Laura and her team were very flexible and easy to work with leading up to the wedding and on wedding day. I would sincerely recommend engaged couples to consider getting married here!

Beautiful, unique space for a special party!

Colvin House is such a special gem. The location and charm can't be beat, and both Angela (owner) and Laura (manager) went above and beyond when our plans evolved (as plans do) to help insure we -- and our guests -- had a wonderfully memorable, comfortable and beautiful experience. Super bonus? The lake is just across the street, expanding the potential for awesome photos. Everyone was impressed with the architectural details inside, too -- there is so much to explore (purple bathroom, carved pillars, intricate ceilings, chandeliers, Juliet balcony, I could go on). We also appreciated the ample restroom options for guests (an extra block is downstairs) and a nice, working kitchen. What also made the venue a great fit was their granting us the freedom to secure vendors of choice -- important to us.

Uniquely wonderful venue

Colvin House is a charming, fabulous space for gatherings of up to 100. Its quirky and compelling architecture started a lot of conversations, and the staff could not have been more helpful. We had a wonderful event!

Colvin House

Colvin is great!! We selected this venue pre-Covid, and not only were they accommodating with re-scheduling, postponements, and questions, they made sure we had the wedding of our dreams when the date arrived. We planned for outdoor ceremony, that seemlessly switched to an indoor celebration without skipping a beat. My only suggestion is brides with 75+ consider cocktail style as the room does fill up. We comfortably had 65 seated, but were happy this was not the 100 guests initially planned. Otherwise this is a photographers dream, and a great place to throw a party. BYOB option is also a major plus
