Camila, our Events & Conference Services Manager, was absolutely incredible. She went above and beyond in ways we didn’t even expect, and even our wedding planner kept pointing out how rare it is to get that level of care. We felt so supported the whole way through. The catering and bartending team was fantastic—they not only listened to our notes but also created amazing signature drinks inspired by the Filipino ingredients we wanted to highlight. They really brought our vision to life. And after the wedding, the staff made sure our things were kept safe until we could pick them up a couple of days later. That extra thoughtfulness meant so much to us. Bell Harbor isn’t just a beautiful venue—it’s run by people who genuinely care, and that made all the difference for us.

My wife and I were married at Beloved in the evening during the summer, and the experience exceeded our expectations. The venue’s lighting and candle arrangements created an elegant atmosphere, and the dance floor was well designed for the event. The space felt intentional and personal without being overdone. The team worked closely with us to ensure our vision came to life, and the staff were professional, attentive, and proactive in keeping everything running smoothly and stress free. We highly recommend Beloved to anyone seeking a well-managed and memorable wedding venue.

As a wedding DJ I can say this is a lovely venue and charming house. The food is great and you can do a lot with the reception room. I recommend uplights for the white drapery and there is a spot for a monogram. The staff is friendly and everything is done on site Darius https://www.grooveonhydestreet.com/

We had our ceremony in the Plaza with our reception in the South Pacific Aquarium, in front of the shark tanks. From start to finish, Lancer Catering (Chip Venzone specifically) was great about answering all of our questions in a very timely manner. We were on a pretty tight budget, but Chip helped us put together a night that we will never forget. We had several compliments on the wedding, and both my wife and I agree that it was even more than we had hoped for. I would absolutely recommend PDZA as a venue!

From the get-go, I was so impressed with The Foundry. I initially spoke to Matt, and we were lucky enough to continue to have him as our event coordinator. I reached out to *so* many venues, and this was the only one that gave me a truly detailed breakdown of everything and a really good idea of what it would look like to have our wedding there. When we toured the space, we knew we found the right spot. It's beautiful inside and there's a lot of great features and room. We had a 185 person guest list, and our final count day-of was 127. There was PLENTY of space for everyone, and there would have been with our original count as well. Matt was so accommodating with us. He really took the time to work with us and help us customize our wedding. His response time was always quick, and I really appreciated the continual clarity with everything. The Foundry is run by Herban Feast, which means catering and the bar is all in-house. Initially, I was a little worried how this would affect the cost. And I'll admit, when I first saw the numbers, I was a little scared. But honestly, this was a crazy good value. The per person price for food was actually a lot lower than a lot of other places, and the food was seriously fantastic. In terms of the bar, they really worked with us and let us do a lot fo customization, which was awesome. In the long run, I was so grateful to not have to worry about food or booze and just let them work their magic! While we didn't do an individual tasting, Herban Feast has open houses for each season, and I was able to taste most of the menu items then. And yes, everything I had was delicious, and our selections were great on the day of the wedding as well. Overall, we were so happy to get married here and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a pain-free planning process. If you're getting married in the summer, it also doesn't hurt that they have AC!

Firstly, I am not one to leave reviews, but just need to share. From the initial inquiry to day of the wedding, LHF couldn't have been a better venue to work with. I wanted something more formal and my fiancé wanted something rustic so this was a great choice. The grounds are stunning and provided so many different backdrops for photos (inside and out; see attached). Guests complimented the venue grounds over and over again. They also raved about the food and staff. I wanted a day with as few vendors as possible. The only additional vendors I needed was a DJ (Sounds Unlimited), DOC (Sophie Blaine) and Photographer (Isaac Gautschi). I used LHF Floral which was great as well. I rented their ice cream cart instead of cake and guests loved it! I loved that they had an indoor area as well in case it rained. That was a big selling point for us. I loved that their outside patio had some covering so guests weren't being scolded by he sun during cocktail hour. It was very close to Everett which was great for guests. And they had a ton of parking. Their response time to emails is timely and they never showed irritation by all my questions. They kept up and documented all the changes I requested throughout planning. I couldn't be happier that we chose LHF for our wedding! Pictures below by Isaac Gautschi.

I cannot say enough good things about this venue - they are a dream come true! We came to Kiana about a year before the wedding with a 2-ceremony vision. Pam, Leslie, and the Kiana team gave us a tour and came back to us with a reasonable plan and quote. They were willing to set up the dining room twice, the wedding ceremony chairs twice, with a quick clean up in between ceremonies! Additionally, they had worked with our planner before and had a good relationship. The space itself is gorgeous. The flowers, the water, the garden, just amazing! There were seals playing and eagles soaring throughout the day. The fact that this is a private property that only hosts one wedding at a time was also something that I found really special and helpful. There is no chance of random people poking their heads in or running into another wedding - the venue is yours for your day, this was really important to us. The food at Kiana is also great :) We wanted to serve a traditional indian/nepali lunch after our first ceremony, and Kiana's chef, Cesar, learned the recipes and cooked the dishes himself!! We had a tasting a couple months before the ceremony with some minor notes and the lunch on the wedding itself came out perfect! They even accommodated some new appetizer recipes for cocktail hour! The dinner was great, and the bar lines were manageable (something we had asked them to be mindful of).

I recently had the pleasure of attending my niece's wedding on April 27, 2024. The venue is absolutely breathtaking. I'm confident that there are many beautiful venues. What makes THIS venue exceptional is the attention to detail by the staff and their professionalism. Every single person I interacted with was helpful, professional, friendly, and simply delightful. They also showed professional when engaging with each other. They went above and beyond to make sure our needs were met, and we were enjoying ourselves. To me, being treated with respect is as important as the venue. I hope the right people read this review so they make sure the staff realizes they have a shout out. If bonuses are available, they earned them! Thank you for making the best day of my niece's life so elegant, classy, and enjoyable.

Great space on Lake Washington. Gorgeous boat deck makes you feel like you are literally on the lake. Wonderful space inside for dinner and another side for dance. If the weather is good dance outside. As a wedding DJ I love thins space for a party. I highly recommend uplights and sparklers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZrzNVj1I0w https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYIwfbkupug Darius Groove on Hyde Street DJs

## Seattle Wedding Venues: Your Wedding Venue Planning Guide for Seattle, WA and Beyond

Quaint coffee shops, gray skies and scenic waterfront views are just a few of the reasons why Seattle, Washington, is for lovers. This gem of the Pacific Northwest will provide a stunning backdrop for your special day, and you'll find a Seattle wedding venue to match you and your fiancé(e)'s style.

## Seattle Wedding Venues

When looking for wedding venues in Seattle, it helps to know just how many options are available to you. There are numerous gardens and wineries around town, many of which offer indoor areas to avoid Seattle's seemingly ever-present rain. You'll also find a myriad of hotels and estates that can be booked for your wedding day. You can even reserve space inside some of the city's most well known landmarks, like Union Station or at the Seattle Art Museum's Olympic Sculpture Park.

Take your time when it comes to booking the wedding venue of your dreams. You'll want to find a space that embodies romance, you and your partner's style and also fits within your[ wedding budget](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/wedding-budget.html). Many Seattle wedding venues cost an average of $4,000 or more, so you want to be confident that you can execute your wedding vision within the space and budget you and your partner have set.

## Travel and Accommodations in Seattle

The Seattle Tacoma International Airport is 14 miles south of downtown Seattle and is a quick trip to most accommodations. The city offers everything from intimate boutique hotels to large resorts. Think ahead by reserving a[ hotel block](https://hotelblocks.weddingwire.com/) for your guests, but plan on allocating an average of $150 to $200 a night on your Seattle accommodation.

For those who don't want to stay in downtown Seattle, or are craving an excellent day trip, direct your guests to either Bellevue or Redmond, Washington. Seattle and its surrounding cities are renowned for their lush greenery and an abundance of hiking, biking and kayaking opportunities. Research the best outdoor activities in the area and give your guests an informative guide filled with fun things to do in the Seattle area upon arrival.

## Weather in Seattle

It's true what they say about Seattle: it's rainy most of the year. However, that doesn't mean that you can't enjoy the city during each and every season. There are roughly 95 days with measurable rainfall in the city, but don't think that Seattle is all gloom and doom. Your wedding could be sunny, as the city is known for receiving roughly 150 sunny days per year. No matter what time of year you tie the knot in the Queen City, make sure you have an indoor area of your venue available and have spare umbrellas around for your guests on hand, just in case.

Celebrate your love in the Pacific Northwest by getting married in Seattle. The seaport city is not only visually stunning, but its cozy shops and friendly residents will have you feeling right at home as you embark on your happily ever after. Begin the journey down the aisle today by using our[ planning tools](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning.html) to organize your Big Day.
