We really enjoyed working with Greg! He was extremely professional easy to communicate with and friendly. We worked with Greg to do premarital counseling prior to our wedding, which was a great opportunity to get to know each other. He did a great job with our ceremony, keeping it simple and sweet, which was exactly what we wanted. Multiple guests from our wedding said how much they enjoyed what he had to say and thought he was awesome.

Marilyn was so easy to work with! We loved getting to know her and sharing our love story. She took a lot of our worries and anxieties of the big day away by being organized and by providing us with a detailed plan. We truly couldn't have picked a better officiant!

Finding and working with Terri was a joy for my wife, Kait, and I. We knew after our first virtual meeting we would be choosing her to officiate our wedding. Afterwards, we met several times for ceremony planning prior to the wedding day. She provided an in-depth overview of what to expect through her ceremony proceeding while answering every question we had along the way. We are spiritual, but not religious, and she was very helpful in bringing a personal touch to our wedding that felt like "us" while making the ceremony feel very special and fun. My wife and I are thrilled to have had Terri as a part of our big day and we would absolutely recommend Moonstone for your ceremony!

My daughter and son-in-law were married in September with Reverand Andrew from St Louis Wedding Chapel as their officiant. The couple had found an officiant and later determined that it wasn’t a good fit. Reverand Andrew was able to step in the last two weeks prior to the wedding. He spoke with the couple several times gaining knowledge of their history and relationship. He made them feel so comfortable and they really connected with him immediately. Reverand Andrew provided the most beautiful ceremony with a really heartfelt message. It felt as if he had known the couple for years rather than just weeks. It was truly one of the most emotional wedding messages I’ve experienced in a long while. And, in general and as expected, Reverand Andrew was on time for both the rehearsal and wedding day, ran the parts of the rehearsal that were in his purview and got out of the way for photos of the first kiss at the end of the ceremony. He also worked well with our Coordinator, Venue Director and DJ. Such a win that we were able to secure Reverand Andrew’s services at such short notice. The couple and I (MOB) highly recommend St Louis Wedding Chapel and Reverand Andrew for anyone looking for a heartfelt, emotional message and wedding ceremony.

Steven was wonderful through the entire process. From the beginning he was organized and gave us example of several different types of ceremonies. Once we knew what we wanted he personalized the ceremony to suit us. On the day of our wedding he was an outstanding speaker. His words moved the guests and our hearts. If you need an officiant who is compassionate, friendly, and articulate he’s the man for you.
