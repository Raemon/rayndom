Stunning venue!

We're wedding florists (Flowers Valley), and we had a fantastic experience working at Canyon View. The staff is attentive and helpful, making the setup process seamless. The venue’s ambiance adds an extra touch of elegance to any event. Highly recommend!

Unforgettable 

We had the pleasure of having our wedding reception at Canyon View and it truly was perfect! There are a couple of points I wish to highlight regarding my experience with Canyon View:  
  
1\. Location/Exterior: Canyon View sits on top of a beautiful hilltop looking over a valley with immaculate views! On top of this, the views are very vibrant with colors from the surrounding greenery and well-maintained flowers around. Parking is extremely spacious. A very private space.  
  
2\. Interior: To start, wow! My wife and I fell in love with the interior. It is extremely spacious with beautiful wooden flooring - which provides great flexibility when it comes to setting the dance floor and seating for guests. Large windows trace the outside so you can't miss the view. Strong contrasts in the light and dark shades make everything pop with eye-catching chandeliers that electrify the space! The buffet tables are grand and the bar strategically placed for easy access while avoiding clutter. We visited many venues and this had the most versatile and stunning interior!   
  
3\. Planning: The Canyon View team is exceptional! I would like to give a personal acknowledgment of Saneta and Jessica in particular. Throughout the 1-year planning phase, they would answer the many questions we had punctually. This instilled great confidence and alleviated ample stress from our shoulders as they helped us move forward with our plans even faster (note that we were planning our wedding from out of state so we couldn't be more thankful for this). Furthermore, Canyon View offers a great deal of flexibility when it comes to planning. Not only do they have wonderful recommended vendors, but they truly offer the floor to you in making your wedding unique!   
During the final meeting, we had the opportunity to meet in person. Before this meeting, we had everything in order with a handful of questions. Coming out of this meeting, Saneta gave us complete confidence that our wedding day plans would be executed perfectly by her, Jessica, and the team. And they absolutely delivered on that!  
More praise to come!   
  
4\. Day of the Wedding: Naturally, tension and stress are high. After the ceremony is over, you feel a huge lift off the shoulders. Once we arrived at the venue, we felt like there was nothing left to worry about as the entire venue was set and ready to go! Saneta was very diligent in keeping our point of contact up-to-date during the setup.   
We did the BYOB package (which we would recommend for flexibility) for the bar. We had someone drop off all the ingredients for the drinks and the bartenders had it all set up and under control - drinks were a hit!   
We decided to do plated and all the food was served so quickly for the guests - we received lots of praise for that which I am passing on here. Furthermore, they loved the food!  
Lastly, everything was going very smoothly, but I know that if there were any questions or requests we had during the reception, that Saneta and Jessica would deliver on them immediately. They were always easy to find and stayed in great communication with us and the point of contact.  
  
We could not have asked for a greater location and space to host our wedding and an awesome team in Saneta and Jessica who really looked out for us and our interests. Thank you!

Amazing venue!

When my partner (now husband) and I walked into Canyon View, we knew this was the venue for us. It is spacious, has a private parking lot, and is incredibly flexible to accommodate our large families. It is also amazingly beautiful to boot!  
  
We worked closely with Saneta and she has been sooo responsive and helpful. She answers all of our questions with such enthusiasm and helpfulness that it made the stressful wedding planning experience a lot less painful.  
  
During our wedding week I was worried about the change in rainy weather but she helped us develop contingency plans and worked with our vendors. She even stayed late one rainy night to help us!  
  
We had an amazing time and cannot recommend the venue and the staff enough. The venue even received a recent renovation and looks even MORE beautiful. We highly recommend Canyon View to anyone who wants a beautiful venue, amazing on-site staff, incredible flexibility, and a good time!

Our Wedding 

My husband and I are honored to have experienced the pleasure of working with Canyon View and making our wedding day perfect. We had both our Ceremony and Reception there. Throughout the planning (especially during the few months prior to our wedding back in April) I've contacted them several times, almost every week but the ladies of Canyon View are so patient, nice and always so welcoming to answer our questions.   
  
We had a tight and busy schedule during our wedding day (with all the picture taking, the scheduled activities like guest performances, cake cutting, ect), but the Canyon View Team made sure to check up on me and my husband on anything that we need like water if we get thirsty. I appreciate it a lot.   
  
We received so many compliments from families and friends about our Wedding day. They loved how gorgeous the whole property is from the inside and out, the delicious food, the wonderful service and the beautiful view looking out the hills from the outside courtyard, especially during sunset.   
  
A big thank you again to the Canyon View team.

I got married here in September and it was absolutely gorgeous! We loved working with Saneta. She helped us so much with planning and really gave great advice on everything to do with the venue. The venue is large and was recently renovated. We are still getting comments on how beautiful the outdoor ceremony was and how great the food was! The sunset photos are amazing. The bring your own bar option also saved us tons of money. If i had to do it all over again, i'd still choose Canyon View :) Great experience!

My brother and I both had our weddings here at the Canyon View on the same weekend (7/11/14 and 7/13/14) . At first, we were a little worried that two weddings at the same venue could turn out to be boring, repetitive and familiar since both of us had a lot of common guests attending both our weddings. After we talked to Saneta, we were not only sure that this wouldn't be the case but it would turn out to be two awesome weddings in one weekend. It's been about three weeks since the weddings, and all of us are still talking about how awesome the wedding was. Our guests are still talking about how the venue was really beautiful, the food delicious and the service - excellent!   
  
I highly recommend this place if you plan on getting married here. The location, the view, the parking and most importantly the Canyon View team makes for a guaranteed fun and successful wedding!!

Both my brothers had their wedding reception at the Canyon View and we worked with Saneta for both weddings. She was such a pleasure to work with and unlike a lot of other wedding halls, Canyon View is super accommodating. We're Tibetans and have certain requirements for our wedding ceremonies, like bringing in our own sweets and home-made cookies to serve guests when they arrive. Saneta was so understanding and super respectful of all our needs. What more can one ask for for their wedding. The wedding planning and the weddings themselves was a huge success. Our guests complimented us on picking such a beautiful venue and was very impressed by the Canyon View staff. Even though we worked with Saneta for most of the planning, on the wedding day- we got to work with Sara and Sabrina, too, who were so friendly and sweet. Plus, we had a lovely waiting staff and bartenders (Carlos and his friend- you guys were amazing!), too. The warmth of the staff was very important since more than 50% of our guests were from out of town and we wanted the wedding to be a extension of their east bay experience. And in all honesty, for both the weddings, Canyon View staff was family!  
  
I would recommend Canyon View to anyone looking for a stress-free wedding. The location is beautiful, there's plenty of parking and the staff is super accommodating. I've been to dozens of weddings and have been part of planning a few other weddings for friends and family at other locations. So far this place has been the best! Thanks Saneta- you really are the bestest! And we're so happy to have gotten a chance to work with Sabrina and Sara, too (even though for a brief time, it was quite a memorable one!).

I love Sabera and her staff! So technically my event was not a wedding but my daughter's bat mitzvah... I have also hosted 3 other banquettes and Canyon view over the last 5 years and am now planning my younger daughter's bat mitzvah in 2015! The staff is great. The venue is gorgeous. I could not ask for a better location and more friendly people!

My wife and I just married at this venue on October 14, 2013. The Canyon View is absolutely amazing. No additional extras required. The moment we walked in we knew this is the place for us. The view at back of the venue is picturesque and it can be used for the wedding pictures. It has a great view of the city from the high vantage point.  
  
The initial meeting was with Sabrina and towards the end our coordinator was Saneta. Saneta was very accommodating and paid attention to details. Everything we wanted was addressed. The food and desert was fabulous and was on time.   
  
If you are looking for a place with a good view, excellent service, and low cost this is it.

My husband and I got married here at this wonderful place on Sept 14, 2013. I can say that we were so glad that we picked this place for our venue because the place was awesome and Sabrina and Saneta (our venue coordinators) are beyond amazing! Words can't describe how this mother and daughter combo treated me nicely. They are very helpful and they really went above and beyond of what was expected from them.  
I came across Canyon View back in 2012 when I was looking around for a venue. We probably looked at 3 different places. Canyon View was the first one we saw and it was love at first sight. The view of the valley from the back was breathtaking and would be a nice backdrop for people who will be taking pictures but most importantly I felt an instant connection and hospitality from Saneta, who helped us from the get-go with the different options that we can choose from. She was amazing to work with! Aside from that, Canyon View was the only place we looked that offered a BYOB (bring your own bar) option. Saneta never once tried to sound like she was upselling the venue to us. She really laid out before our eyes how much we will spend if we were to choose this option from that option, how much will it be if we bring our own bar versus if we were to use their bar option. I liked that! Numbers before my eyes was great! In other words, we got a bang for our buck by choosing Canyon View. Throughout the wedding planning process I would email back and forth with Saneta or I will call them and they are very responsive. Not sure what people are saying regarding them being unorganized because I never once felt like they were. Whenever we make revisions on the contract, they will send me a revised invoice. I made sure to make notes of my requests for our final meeting based on our email exchanges. I worked with Sabrina during our final meeting and they made everything happen for me. I am truly grateful for that.  
I would recommend Canyon View!!!
