Our guests had a great time

The venue is lovely, the food was excellent, and our planner, Taylor Leon was both gracious and competent. We could not have been more pleased with our daughter's wedding.

Way beyond our expectations!

Our wedding at Marin Country Club was incredible. We worked with Michelle Sand, who brings a wealth of experience, and it truly showed. She was there the entire day making sure everything was perfect. Michelle truly knows what she is doing, and you are in great hands with her. She was also very responsive leading up to the wedding in order to properly prepare us.  
As far as the venue goes, it was perfect. We had perfect weather for the ceremony, along with the obviously beautiful view of the trees in the background. The reception after was excellent, with good food, and a great setup for dancing. It was also nice to have access to the locker rooms to change shoes and take off my tie once the formalities were done. MCC is an excellent wedding venue, and I'm so happy that we decided to have our wedding there.

Susan and her team were a dream to work with on our wedding day! Susan was great to communicate with via email, and we consulted with her in person a few times. The venue was even more beautiful than I could have imagined on the day of the wedding. Marin Country Club is also the best deal in town, has a beautiful backdrop of hills and trees, and the food is amazing. Our wedding day was like a fairy tale come true, and Susan helped make that possible. I can't recommend MCC enough!!
