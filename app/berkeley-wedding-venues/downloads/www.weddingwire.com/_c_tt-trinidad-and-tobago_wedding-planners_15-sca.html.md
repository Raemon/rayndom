The 60th wedding anniversary party organized by JG Signature Weddings was nothing short of exceptional. From start to finish, the event reflected elegance, warmth, and meticulous attention to detail. Her décor design was absolutely stunning—tastefully curated, beautifully balanced, and perfectly suited to celebrate such a meaningful milestone. Every element, from the color palette to the table settings, felt thoughtfully planned and flawlessly executed. Beyond the visuals, the level of service was truly top class. The entire team was professional, attentive, and seamless in their coordination, ensuring that everything ran smoothly and stress-free. Guests were made to feel special, and every request was handled with care and efficiency. JG Signature Weddings delivered excellence in both design and service, creating a memorable and heartfelt celebration that will be cherished for years to come.

Curtis and Team are so professional, very understanding and willing to go above and beyond to please their clients. We had some ideas for decor for our microwedding and Curtis was able to bring it to life in such a short space of time. He even had some wonderful recommendations that made our special day so memorable. Thank you so much Curtis and Team! \- Danielle + Kurt
