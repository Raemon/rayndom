There were many positives and a few areas for improvement during our wedding experience at the Bedford Village Inn. Positives: Hosting our wedding at the BVI was truly incredible. The venue itself is stunning, and because. We got married in December, the holiday décor made everything feel warm, festive, and cozy. The décor team did an excellent job bringing our vision to life and followed our requests beautifully. Our event planner, Madison Minds, was wonderful to work with. She was organized, responsive, and consistently kind throughout the planning process. On the wedding day, Maddie, (I believe she was our event assistant), was also extremely helpful and warm. She ensured the day flowed smoothly and made us feel very supported. We also received countless compliments on the food. We selected the chicken, beef, ravioli, and tomato bisque; everything was absolutely delicious. The culinary team truly delivered a 10/10 experience! Areas to Keep in Mind: One unexpected challenge occurred when we learned, about a week before the wedding, that a rehearsal for another wedding would be taking place while my bridal party and I were getting ready the day of our scheduled wedding. Although we were notified (not far advanced enough before committing to this venue), it still felt a bit disruptive on a day meant to be private and intimate. Despite this, we did our best to stay positive and enjoy the moment. The most difficult aspect of the day involved interactions with our event coordinator/banquet manager, Brittany De Jesus. While she was professional at certain points, there were moments where her communication came across as abrupt, confusing, and rude, particularly during the processional lineup. This caused unnecessary stress for my bridesmaids, groomsmen, and especially my mother-in-law, who felt she was spoken to harshly and was yelled at by Ms. De Jesus when she simply asked for clarification about the lineup/seating arrangement during the ceremony. There were also some timeline miscommunications; however, Ms. De Jesus did approach us later to apologize, which we appreciated. Overall: Even with a few challenges, our wedding at the BVI was beautiful, memorable, and filled with many wonderful moments. The venue, décor, food, and the majority of the staff were exceptional. With some improvements in communication and guest interactions, this venue has the potential to offer an even more flawless experience.

The venue at Stonewall Farm is incredible. Alesa our event manager was exceptional and made anything we wanted possible. She was very accomodating and very understanding and helpful. The property is so grogeuos and perfect for any type of wedding. We could not have found a better venue especially when you consider the price. We loved how the venue was so open to any vendors and willing to work with anyone. Anyone looking for a wonderful, easy, picturesque venue and a great price should use Stonewall Farm.

The minute we stepped foot into the orchard we knew it was for us. This was the first place on our list and had no need to search any further. The owners and venue coordinator went above and beyond to give us the wedding of our dreams. Communication is key and there was never any concern throughout our planning process right up to the ceremony. Our coordinator was great in creating a timeline with flexibility just in case the weather didn’t cooperate. What stood out to us and spoke volume was it was clear that she lives for what she does. It wasn’t just a job. Receiving that kind support and energy squashes any stress and anxiety. The day of our wedding was beautiful and truly a day we will never forget. Our friends and family had a fantastic time. Take in every moment because your day is over before you know it. Step foot into Alyson’s Orchard. You’ll fall in love like we did.

I could not be more excited to be working with both Nicole and Keith for our upcoming wedding in March of 2026! The venue is gorgeous and their pricing can’t be beat! You truly can customize your event to meet your budget needs. I love that this is a family owned business and it’s clear in comparison to other venues i researched, that The Greatful Dane is unique and special. Highly recommend!

My husband and I got married at Bellevue Barn in August and it was absolutely magical. From the moment we went to tour this venue I got teary, looked at my now husband, and said this was the venue I had always dreamed of. The venue exceeded all of our expectations. The Chapel and the Barn were absolutely perfect and beautifully maintained. The Carlisle Place was able to accommodate the whole bridal party for the weekend and had the most incredible bridal suite. As far as the staff, I'd say how great they were, but words don't do justice to how wonderful they made our day. They are professional, courteous, responsive, and felt like part of our friends and family. We will forever be thankful to the Bellevue team; they went above and beyond our every expectation and ensured we made a memory that will last a lifetime.

As parents we mark our children’s progression though their milestone. Birth, first steps, that big yellow bus, dorms with a keg camouflaged in the corner, to their marriage with their own children. These days pass very quickly and before we are ready, we are all planning a wedding. The day must be perfect. In our story our daughter wanted a Barn venue in NH. We had many happy memories of family vacations on the lake. We saw many wonderful venues. But none could compare to the warmth, elegance and professionalism of the INN On Main, in Wolfeboro NH. We Arrived at our first appointment to be greeted by Shannon. She was lovely. The Barn was gorgeous. Truly the bride and groom’s vision. We toured the property that had 14 guest rooms. This included handicap accessible and pet friendly rooms. Then rooms were clean and steps away from the venue which made it easy for guests to return to their rooms during and after the reception. We were introduced to the irreplaceable Patti. Throughout the months of planning, Patti guided us through florist, hair stylists, makeup artists and limousine services with pristine reputations. We spent a night at the Inn a few weeks prior to wedding to review the menu and details. We arrived at O Bistro to be greeted with literally open arms and a warm hug from Patti. Working with her felt like we were all planning our daughter’s wedding with family. Her experience, leadership, attention to detail, and sheer joy is un-matched. The Barn was large enough to hold our 100 guests with ease during Covid. The dance floor supported the band and over 60 wild dancers! The barn featured a cozy fireplace elegantly decorated as a backdrop for the bride and groom’s table. The PA system worked perfectly for wedding speeches. The kitchen is attached to the barn assuring the prompt delivery of hot service and specialty meals for our gluten free and vegan guest as well as any special requests from the guests. Patti suggested a variety of options, keeping our budget in mind. We choose the family style menu to accommodate both our younger robust guest and our petite appetites. The loft overlooks the venue. Our photographers were able to capture some fantastic memories for us. The well-stocked bar is strategical placed out of the way however easily accessible. As are the handicap rest rooms. Outside of the barn there is a peaceful patio where our guests relaxed after dinner enjoying cocktails. The patio overlooks the property while still being close enough to enjoy the wedding atmosphere and the music. The big day finally arrived. The bride and groom were excited beyond belief. Guests were embarking. The Venue was beautifully decorated. Patti had arrived early to make sure the day was perfect. She helped set up the memorial table, the projector, the sound system (synching the slide show with music), when she noticed a light bulb out over the bride and grooms table. She summoned a ladder to change a light bulb on a 20-foot ceiling! The lighting helped to make all photographs perfect. She also noticed that the bride’s seating charts had not arrived and called to have those delivered. She assisted our vendors as they arrived. However, I was flabbergasted when I learned of something else, that Patti had quietly maneuvered! On her way to The Inn on Main, for the final preparation for our daughter’s wedding. Patti recalled there was construction at the pier on lake Winnipesauke. The wedding portraits would be taken there at the gazebo. She realized a backhoe would be in photographs. She appealed to the drivers asking him to please move the backhoe from the camera’s view! Patti wasn’t just making sure the venue was perfect. She was making sure that the entire day was perfect. Patti’s service is above and beyond perfection. As all weddings do, ours had a glitch which delayed the church service and thus everything else for 45 minutes. Patti greeted all of our guests before the wedding party arrived. Her staff was wonderful in keeping the appetizer’s flowing, and our guests happy and entertained. The bar was well stocked including the Signature Drink. The Bartender Jerry was efficient as well as humorous. Having the wedding at the Inn On Main was like having it among family. People who cared for you and your moments. The chef prepared each meal with elegance. The food was delectable. Your chef is amazing! Your entire staff is amazing. However, there is one person who we are afraid may go unnoticed. She quietly tends to the needs of others. Undiscerning of notoriety. We want to tell you how wonderful Cheryl is. She tended to our lodging guests every need. Many of them commented how personable and fantastic she treated them. In closing we want to reiterate many of our guest remarked “this was the best wedding we have ever been to”. We want to thank all of you for being part of one of the most precious moments of our lives. For making our experience at the Inn On Main truly everything we could have dreamed of for our daughter and son in law. The Fantasia"s

We got married at Dell-Lea in August and had the best experience. There is literally nothing that could have been done better. My husband and I got amazing service from tour, to details meeting, food tasting, rehearsal, day of the wedding all the way through picking up the decor the next day. It is so clear that TouTou and David have gone above and beyond to make their property welcoming and beautiful for everyone who visits. The food was amazing - in fact, a couple months later and we are still getting feedback from our friends and family that this was the best wedding food they ever had. Portions are great, appetizers are hearty and delicious - you really can't pick anything wrong with their entire selection. The servers were caring and made each of our guests feel taken care of. They were prompt and efficient, friendly and knowledgeable about the property's history which our guests enjoyed. The fact that I had TouTou as our day of coordinator was a God-send. Being a bride can be very stressful, but she thought of everything and then some. I felt relaxed knowing she was in charge and taking care of everything. She is a special person and I am so lucky we got to have her expertise. The beauty of this venue is unmatched. We toured several places and there really is nothing like this property. It is a slice of heaven on earth! The inside is rustically elegant which is exactly what we were going for. We didn't need to dress anything up - just focus on our personal touches - because the place is gorgeous inside and outside. David does a wonderful job maintaining the property along with TouTou's gardening of course. We had a Friday wedding and the fact that we could set up and rehearse the day before on a Thursday made everything so much easier for the day of. Highly recommend a Friday wedding for this reason! We want to thank the entire team for making our wedding planning and actual wedding day the best it could possibly have been.

We had our wedding here two weeks ago and I cannot say enough kind words about Elise and Oliver. They were so communicative, easy to work with, and down to earth. Made our wedding so very special. The venue was something out of a story book. It was the first and only place we toured and it did not disappoint. Our wedding was 185 and they made it all work! There was something so special about the down to earth touches from the local bartenders to the blueberries in our cocktails! The most special day and others have said the same. Cannot thank you enough.

I cannot say enough good words about our experience with the Christmas Farm Inn. Everything was perfection from start to finish. The venue is adorable, the food was absolutely delicious and the staff were welcoming, attentive, kind and caring. I could not have asked for a better experience. It’s been a few days and I am still swooning over the whole thing. We would HIGHLY recommend this venue to anyone who may be interested. It is perfect for small groups as well if you’re looking to throw a micro wedding!

I cannot speak highly enough about our experience at Ragged Mountain Resort. While the venue itself was beautiful, the venue coordinator Jessica is the person who truly set this experience apart for us. Jessica quite literally gave the shoes off of her feet to my husband’s grandmother when she was struggling to walk in her heels. Not only that, but when this same grandma called the venue to coordinate lodging for the weekend, Jessica stayed on the phone with her for the full day even when his grandma decided to go with an Airbnb and not with one of the cardigan cabins. She’s the most generous person I’ve ever met and made the day feel effortless. From fulfilling every request, including getting a keg of our favorite beer, to quietly handling things behind the scenes, she made everything run seamlessly. Having our wedding in such a beautiful venue, and working with Jessica and the Ragged Mountain staff, set the tone for the whole wedding. A few additional notes: the food was excellent, and we were able to arrange vegan options for our guests. The Ragged Mountain decorations really elevated the space. Keep in mind that the venue doesn’t have air conditioning, and the reception is held upstairs with no elevator. We were fortunate to have mild weather in mid-June and were able to assist guests with mobility limitations, but this is important to consider depending on your needs.
