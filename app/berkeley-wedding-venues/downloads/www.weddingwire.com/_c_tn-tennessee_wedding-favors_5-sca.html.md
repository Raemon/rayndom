I gave away little 2 oz. jars of jam/preserves from Hams and Jams as my wedding favors. Most of the guests were from out of town and we wanted to share with them a Nashville treasure. I was able to order the items in bulk and pick them up at their downtown location. They offer to personalize the jars with a sticker and wrap them in cellophane tied with a ribbon to coordinate with your colors, but I bought small cardboard favor boxes that fit perfectly.

We ordered our gold, truffle boxes from Nashville wraps and they were the perfect touch to our elegant wedding. Our items were delivered within days and were in great condition. Nashville Wraps has so many options for favors and additional items!

This place is like hansel and gretel's gingerbread house (without the witch) or willy wonka's chocolate factory (without the umpaloompas)… EVERYTHING is delicious. I didn't really know what I wanted for our wedding dessert, but the hot chocolatier can do it all: cakes, cupcakes platters, truffle trays… if it can conceivably be dipped in chocolate, they do! And after a single planning session, I simply put my budget into their capable hands and was not in the least disappointed, and our wedding theme was accommodated in the classiest way. Wendy B is truly an artist!

When the scope of the expenditure on our wedding became clear, we made the choice to forgo the wedding favors, and instead planted trees in everyone's names via SoundForest. Based in Nashville, this organization is run by a great friend of ours, Tom Solinsky. Not only is he planting trees in our guests' honor, he also transformed our yard in a way we never fathomed, and has been doing so for years. He is a true friend, a great community leader, and a really fun guy! If you want more information about this great organization, go to www.soundforest.org.

Greeks was so easy to work with, and our invitations and ceremony programs turned out great. The quality was awesome, and there is a product to work with everyone's budget. Would definitely recommend them for invitations or printing for anything.
