## How much does a wedding dress cost?

Buying a wedding dress is unlike purchasing a piece of everyday attire. You’re going to be wearing this dress on one of the most important days of your life, and so you’ll likely spend quite a bit of money on your [wedding dress](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/dresses). While wedding dress prices do vary greatly, the average wedding dress cost in the U.S. is $1,000. It typically ranges from $280 to $1,650, but you can purchase a wedding dress for far above and below those prices.

  * __ $ 207 or less Lower range
  * __ $ 1,200  Average cost
  * __ $ 800 - $ 1,675  Most couples spend between
  * __ $ 2,500 or more Upper range



Costs displayed are based on spend from thousands of couples who recently reported pricing for this service within their WeddingWire review. Pricing varies based on factors including, but not limited to, vendor’s experience, level of expertise, event guest count, date, and geographic region.

What impacts wedding dress prices?

__

There are a few factors that will impact your wedding dress cost. Most notably, an extremely detailed wedding dress with lots of beading and pricey fabric (silk, etc.) will cost more than a simpler wedding dress, as more intricate gowns require more labor and materials. So a [grand ball gown](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/dresses/ball-gown) with beading and detailed embroidery will cost more than a plainer [sheath dress](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/dresses/sheath). Also, if you’re set on wearing a wedding dress by a famous dress designer, know that it will likely cost more. 

What additional wedding dress costs should a bride plan for?

__

There are several additional costs that brides should factor into their wedding dress cost and budget. These include:

  * Alterations: If you want to drastically change your wedding dress, your alterations may end up costing more than your actual wedding dress!
  * Undergarments and accessories: Be sure to factor in your accessories— [bridal undergarments](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-shop-for-wedding-undergarments), shoes, and more. These accessories will greatly affect how your gown looks and fits, so don’t forget to include them in your wedding dress cost.
  * Cleaning and preservation: Don’t be surprised if you’re still spending money on your wedding dress after your wedding! Whether you plan on wearing your wedding dress again, passing it on to a future generation, or none of the above, it’s still a good idea to have your gown professionally cleaned and preserved. Wedding dress cleaning and preservation can cost $200 or more.



How can you save money on a wedding dress?

__

Yes, a bride’s wedding dress will cost a lot of money—probably more than you’ll spend on another piece of attire in your life! However, there are several ways to [save money on your wedding dress](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/save-money-on-a-wedding-dress) while still finding a gown that you absolutely love.

  * Don’t try on dresses that are over-budget: Be upfront with your bridal salon consultant about your budgets—and be sure ask about the cost of each dress you try on. Avoid the temptation of trying on a wedding dress that’s out of your price range.
  * Find a simple wedding dress, and accessorize: As mentioned, a simple and relatively unadorned wedding gown will cost less than an extremely detailed wedding dress. If you’re on a tight wedding dress budget, we recommend finding a simple gown and using a beaded sash or a brooch to give it some extra sparkle.
  * Find a dress you love as is: Any significant alterations or customizations that you do to a wedding dress will cost (a lot of!) money. Therefore, if you want to make significant changes to a wedding dress (add sleeves, change the silhouette, etc.), that gown is probably not for you. Look for a wedding dress that you love mostly as it looks off the hanger.
  * Scour sample sales: Many bridal salons offer sample sales where they sell sample dresses from past seasons. These sample dresses are typically in sizes 6 to 12, so if you fall in that size category, you may find a gorgeous gown at a low price at one of these sales.
  * Visit trunk shows: If you’re set on purchasing a gown by a specific designer, you might find a deal at a trunk show. Trunk shows are when a bridal salon features the collection of a particular dress designer—and usually offers a discount (usually about 5 or 10 percent off that designer’s wedding dress prices). Research which salons in your area carry your favorite designers, and check their websites for upcoming trunk shows.
  * Give yourself time to shop: A wedding dress can take several months to arrive after you’ve ordered it. Be sure to [start shopping for your wedding dress as soon as possible](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/why-you-must-shop-for-your-wedding-dress-early) —many brides shop at least nine months in advance, if not more. If you wait until the last minute, you may end up paying rush charges for your dress, which can greatly add to your total wedding dress cost.



How much does it cost to alter a wedding dress?

__

[Wedding dress alterations](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/tips-for-wedding-dress-alterations-fittings) can be expensive—particularly if you’re planning on making major changes to your wedding dress. Some bridal salons offer wedding dress alterations in-house. If yours does not, you will likely have to find a tailor who specializes in wedding dresses (be sure to read online reviews of wedding dress tailors before hiring). You’ll typically schedule your wedding dress fittings for at least three months before your big day—so plan accordingly. 76 percent of bridal salons charge alterations by piece rather than a flat fee, so the average cost of dress alterations can vary widely depending on the extent of the alterations. Simply adjusting a hemline won’t cost a ton, but adding sleeves or reworking a bodice will! 

What questions should you ask a wedding dress tailor?

__

When choosing a wedding dress tailor, there are several questions you should ask:

  * How many fitting appointments will I need? How long will the process take?
  * What types of alterations do you recommend for my wedding dress?
  * Have you worked with a dress and fabric like mine before?
  * Can you provide a cost for my alterations?
  * How will you store my wedding dress?
  * What do I need to bring to my first fitting appointment?

As a bride who didn’t quite know what she wanted dress-wise, Kateri made my day perfect and stress free! She took the time to look at all the dresses I had wanted to try on (even a few just for fun that I knew I wouldn’t wear, how sweet!) She was very professional and made me feel very comfortable! Highly recommend Mimi’s (especially Kateri) to all brides-to-be!! The appointment was very personalized and I truly felt like they wanted me to find my perfect dress!

Savvi Formalwear was one the only suit-rental option I could visit in-person in St. Louis that had a dark green suit. The suits turned out so lovely for my wedding. The groom was free with the rentals for the groomsmen. They provided suits, shoes, shirts, and ties upon pick-up. They had options on the day beforehand to exchange if any sizes were incorrect. The fit was great for all the groomsmen. Only hiccup was that my husband didn't end up getting a vest with his suit as requested, but that is probably his fault for not noticing when he picked up his suit.

Had the best experience at Bridal Parlour! I was pretty nervous going into it, Bridal Parlour was the first bridal shop I went to so didn't know what to expect. I was interested in the designer, Made With Love and was drawn to Bridal Parlour because of that. Little did I know it would end up being the best experience. As soon as we walked in the door, Heather welcomed me and my family/friends with open arms. She had dresses from my lookbook that I "liked" already pulled aside and she had gone through my Pinterest board to get a feel for what I liked and had pulled additional dresses based on that. She explained the process and was so helpful without being overbearing. The dress selection at Bridal Parlour is amazing and the dresses were such high quality. As I was trying on dresses, Heather would ask what I liked and didn't like and would pull additional dresses for me to try on based on that. As I tried on dresses and said parts I didn't like she would confirm in her notes, different changes we could make to the dress based on the designer. She never promised anything without double checking and I so appreciated that. I never once felt pressure from Heather to say yes to a dress (I knew I'd be a person that would want to think on it) and Heather even said that she's a big proponent of "sleeping on it," which I did for 1.5 weeks! The other bridal shop I went to I did not have this same experience at all which made me appreciate Heather and Bridal Parlour 100 times more! I ended up emailing and calling Heather after a couple times to confirm the fit of the dress I wanted and Heather was again, so helpful and came up with a solution to the issue I was having. Cannot recommend Bridal Parlour enough and am so thankful for Heather!

I needed a dress for a formal wedding, was having a hard time finding a plus size dress that I liked. Found this boutique on a Google search and visited the store. Her variety in styles and sizes is wonderful. I immediately found some dresses I really liked. Ended up ordering a dress through the owner. She helped me find the perfect a line dress for my body. I cannot recommend Love’s Bridal Boutique enough.

This bridal shop has it all. Taylor is a great bridal consultant! She had a vision for me and I couldn’t see it until my wedding day. I picked a dress that younger me would have adored! After recently having a baby, I have low self esteem. Thank you Taylor for helping me pick my dream dress and always reassuring me that this was the one.

I have been going to Usha for many years with various different clothing items so when it came time to alter my wedding dress, I knew she would be the first person I would go to! Usha was a pleasure to work with throughout the entire process and was very quick! I had an extremely complex dress with lots of lace and alterations needed. She listened to what I visioned my dress to look like and created something even better. Per my request, she was able to add several lace appliques to add more coverage to the front of my dress, added cup support, hemmed the dress (which was no small feat, it involved moving all of the lace up piece by piece), adding a bustle, adding lots of buttons, and adding to the back to help the dress stay in place. I am very thin and had problems with the illusion neckline and lace sleeves staying in place but Usha did a great job fixing my dress so I was able to have no issues with the dress staying in place during the wedding! I don't even want to think about how many hours Usha spent altering my dress, but I know that she charged way less than than others would have charged for the amount of time she spent on my dress. She and her husband were very pleasant to work with and were very helpful throughout the entire process! Overall, I was so pleased with how my dress turned out and I had no issues with it the day of my wedding. I fully recommend Usha for dress alterations!

Unbelievably talented artist who has turned her passion for Style and fashion into works of art. If you need an unbelievably stunning pair of shoes that are truly masterpieces this is the company to go to. She will customize each pair of shoes to your exact specifications and put love and care and diligence in everything she does. I still have my Cardinals flats from 2 years ago that I wear each baseball season and they look brand new. The quality of the products is outstanding. One of a kind person running a fabulous business!
