Aimee was extremely helpful and made my dreams come to life within my budget. I told her the colors, and vibe I wanted and she recommended certain flowers to make that happen. She is extremely knowledgeable on every type of flower and different types of greenery. She even made a custom hair piece for me and a flower crown for my flower girl!

I cannot say enough good things about the Archivist! My husband and I planned our wedding in six weeks, and Paula was organized, responsive, and supportive the entire time. She was patient with our many requests and questions, and she was collaborative and considerate of our preferences. Paula is an artist. She crafted beautiful, artistic pieces that built on our ideas and transformed them into something even better than we had the ability to envision on our own. Paula provided clear and detailed estimates, and she was very willing to talk through costs, make adjustments to the estimates, and come up with flexible and creative solutions - amazing product at an affordable price. Paula sincerely values the trust that a couple places in her to make their dreams for their wedding day a reality, and the amount of care, thought, and passion that she puts into her work is clear. Bottom line, Paula delivers - I was blown away by the quality of her work and the level of detail in each piece that she was able to provide. She remembered small details of our conversations and incorporated those into the arrangements, which was memorable and touching. Choose Paula and the Archivist as your florist - you will not be disappointed!

Emma was wonderful! I had no idea where to start but she helped me figure out the perfect floral designs for my wedding. She was easy to contact, great about communicating with me, and answered every question I had. Cashen Creek was flexible and reliable. The day-of, everything went perfectly smooth! I am very grateful for the team at Cashen Creek that helped our wedding be so beautiful.

Flower Boys made my wedding floral vision come to life! The team at Flower Boys is so lovely to work with and their personal consultations made me feel so informed & excited about the process. I wanted my florals to be soft colors and timeless. They delivered, plus some. I would recommend them to every single bride & groom!!

Courtney did an AMAZING job. She is very detail oriented and asks many questions to ensure her client is getting the exact vision they thought of. She created Pinterest worthy works of art!

I was able to sit down with Julie multiple times before my wedding leaving me feeling confident and calm about how things would turn out. She was very professional, and communication was excellent. Julie and her team made my vision come to light exactly how I wanted it! I picked the best florists in town hands down!!!!!

Bokay created florals that absolutely blew us away. They made our vision not only come to life but exceeded all expectations. They truly made my wedding look better than I could have imagined in my wildest dreams. There were so many guests that frequently told us that these were the best florals they had seen in a wedding. The florals were gorgeous and held up all night. (and even today, 4 days later as they look beautiful on my kitchen counter for display) Personally, I preferred a wildflower vibe with mixed florals, cacti, and greenery with heavy candles. They managed to create this in the most incredible way from my wedding backdrop, to the entry way, to my gorgeous dining table center pieces, to even tiny details all around each event room. My bouquet still brings tears to my eyes! Specifically, I had the privilege of working with Zack a majority of the time and he was fantastic. He looked at my pinterest boards, heard my vision during our meeting, and knew exactly what I wanted. There were multiple adjustments I made with things last minute due to seating/tables and they were extremely attentive and accommodating. I cannot recommend Bokay enough for their hard work and spectacular florals. I am so grateful for Bokay and all they did to create my perfect wedding.

LOOK NO FURTHER- truly the best florist you can find in Indianapolis, hands down. I cannot rave enough about Lilly Lane. They are a true local Indianapolis shop... engaged in the community and full of wonderful people. They were a delight from start to finish. We were clueless about the whole process of wedding planning, and they were SO informative and helpful, while not being pushy at all. Prices are so reasonable for the quality of what they deliver, and they worked with our budget and vision. It was such a stress relief to know they were on our team, and would do an incredible job without a lot of input from us (especially the day of). If you are planning any event, especially a wedding, look no further. As the bride, I was just so stressed with all of the planning, and they just made me SO comfortable and at ease from the first meeting. It made the floral aspect something I didn't have to worry about in the slightest. Sharing a photo of my bridal bouquet because...WOW. Stunning, cascading white orchids that were just beyond my high expectations. You can tell they are passionate about florals and also their clients. We could not have been happier.

I cannot thank Michelle at One of a Kind events enough for the absolutely stunning floral arrangements she and her team created for my wedding! From the very beginning, she understood my vision and brought it to life in ways I couldn’t have imagined. Every bouquet, centerpiece, and floral installation was breathtaking and perfectly matched the atmosphere we were hoping for. The flowers were fresh, vibrant, and beautifully arranged - our guest couldn’t stop complimenting them & still do to this day!! The attention to detail was impeccable, and it was clear that so much care and love went in to every arrangement. Working with Michelle was just a joy, and I felt completely at ease knowing she was handling our floral needs. Thank you again for making our wedding day even more magical. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for top-tier floral design!
