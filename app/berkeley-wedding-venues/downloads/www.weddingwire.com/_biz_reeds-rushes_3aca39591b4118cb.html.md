Amazing Venue!!

Reeds & Rushes is an amazing venue! When we first toured the place, it was still under construction, but we trusted Curtis and Maddy's vision. They truly impressed us with the final result. With the wood details and black and white accents, the venue provides the perfect backdrop for your special day. We were thrilled with the addition of the dock and the pergolas in the back patio. Our outdoor ceremony by the lake was beautiful. The Bridal & Groom suites were terrific, I loved that the Groom suite had a golf simulator – it kept the guys entertained while they waited! The Bridal suite was also gorgeous and spacious enough for 8+ girls. Curtis and Maddy were excellent to work with, very responsive, and always helpful whenever we had any questions. I would definitely recommend them!

Perfect Day Perfect Place

Reeds and Rushes is truly one of the best wedding venues out there! From our very first meeting to the big day, they were incredibly organized and a joy to work with. The venue itself had the perfect modern aesthetic we were looking for, and both the bridal and groom’s suites were outstanding. Our guests loved the patio space and it was wonderful having an area where they could relax by the fire, play games, and visit. The staff went above and beyond to bring our vision to life, and we couldn’t be more grateful! Choosing Reeds and Rushes was, without a doubt, one of the best decisions!
