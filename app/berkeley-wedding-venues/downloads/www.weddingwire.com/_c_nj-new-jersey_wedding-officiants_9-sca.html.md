Elizabeth was incredibly kind, personable, and such a joy to work with. She made the entire process feel easy and comfortable, and she truly helped make our wedding day something we’ll remember forever. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience!

Celia was absolutely fantastic! She made our day all the more special with her positive energy. Her ability to capture our 11 year relationship in a 17 minute ceremony, was truly impressive; So much so, that some of our guests came to us and asked if she was a family friend. We are both truly grateful to have had Celia be the one to marry us. If you want someone who is down to earth, thoughtful, and attentive; Then you need to pick Celia.

We got married on 12/31/2024 and once every month for a year leading up to our wedding date we met with Maureen so she could get to know us so that way our ceremony could feel more personal and felt like a friend was marring us. Maureen was extremely professional and all of our guests raved about her! The ceremony was light hearted, romantic, and sentimental (just what we asked for). There was not a dry eye in the audience! We would recommend Maureen to anyone in a heartbeat.

Rev. Joe was great. Wrote everything for us (which was exactly what we wanted!) after getting to know us. Even met with us for coffee so we could get to know him before we decided on an officiant.

Mitch is one of a kind. He is warm and kind yet hilarious and fun. He was perfect for my ceremony and it seems as he was meant to be the minister for us as we will literally never forget this man.

My husband and I had another officiant lined up that backed out at the last minute due to a family emergency. In a panic, I looked up other officiants in the area and I found Rev Whalen who happened to be available on my wedding date. He happily accepted the job, despite the last minute notice. He made the entire experience very easy for my destination wedding on the Jersey shore. Thank you!

Rev. Glenn was a fantastic officiant for our wedding day. He has such a great demeanor, sense of humor, and voice for officiating. He came early and prepared, he was very professional and flexible, and truly makes the experience about your love. We got many compliments from guests who found Rev. Glenn's service both beautiful and entertaining. He provides a thorough ceremony kit which made it easy to customize the ceremony to our liking. Even though we only knew each other for a short time, he made it seem like we were long time friends. We highly recommend Rev. Glenn!

The mother of the bride requested us to have an officiant at the wedding vs a family member, which we honored her wishes. She sent us a few options and Father Vince was one of several. After meeting with everyone, we knew Father Vince was the one. He allowed us to ask any questions we had and was not pushy at all when we told him we needed time to decide. After selecting him, he supplied more information then we even knew we needed. He supported us prior and after the wedding to make sure we have our marriage documentations. During this whole process we met for the scheduled meetings for us to know each other. In fact he got to know us so well that our family and friends asked if he knew us our whole lives (which we only met for max 5 hours throughout the whole process and only met face to face day of the wedding). Our ceremony was personal and catered to our wishes and beliefs (we didn't want it to be heavy on religion, etc) and he kept everyone laughing and engaged. Even better it was exactly the length we wanted! We couldn't have asked for anyone better to help us through this whole process! Don't hesitate and book Father Vince - this review is coming from someone who is type A and will not leave reviews unless they truly deserve it. You won't regret it!
