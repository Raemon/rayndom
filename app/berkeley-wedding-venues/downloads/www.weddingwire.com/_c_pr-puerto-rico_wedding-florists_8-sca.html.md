Our wedding at fusion beach villas was like a DREAM, it was all we wanted and more; the process was also so smooth. With my fiance and I having a lot on our plates Elaine made the process and the day of SO smooth and the results stunned us! Our family and us can’t stop talking about how beautiful, organized and fun it went. All details from my bouquet to the decoration, the coordination, the vendors we perfectly picked. We couldn’t have picked a better place and a better person, Elaine. I love flowers and Elaine made the bouquet of my dreams! She worked with us and communication was so clear, efficient, she is responsive, honest and gives great recommendations. The decoration of our wedding was very elegant, the day of all we did was enjoy with our loved ones. Also staying at fusion beach villas was perfect, we are planning going back for our anniversary. Again we couldn’t have picked a better place.

Everything was exactly what I asked for or more. The price was as to be expected but worth it. They paid attention to the details and delivered what I asked for.

OMGGGG I am astounded, and I have no words to describe what David did! He excelled as our event planner, decorator, and coordinator. He went above and beyond with everything. I had to hold back tears as I witnessed the ceremony and reception. He truly outdid himself. Our wedding had a Christmas theme. I had such positive feedback from family and friends. Every detail was well planned and brilliantly executed. Throughout the planning process, he was organized, responsive, and proactive, making everything feel manageable. On the wedding day, he planned everything well and handled any concerns quietly behind the scenes, letting us to fully enjoy our day without worry. If you want someone to plan, create, and manage your wedding with professionalism and precision, David is your guy. I can't recommend him enough. Thank you David for all your hard work and effort that you put into our wedding, we adore you!!!!

Isa fue una florista excepcional. Desde el primer momento fue puntual, organizada y totalmente comprometida con que cada detalle floral fuera perfecto. Los arreglos quedaron hermosos, exactamente como los imaginamos, y además tuvo la iniciativa de reutilizar de manera inteligente las flores de la ceremonia para la mesa de novios, algo que agradecimos muchísimo. Su trabajo elevó completamente la estética de nuestra boda. Definitivamente no pudimos haber esperado un mejor servicio. Recomendada al 100%.

Working with Eunice and Pike’s Flower Shop was absolutely amazing! As our partial wedding planner and florist, I had a ton of ideas for our wedding weekend, and Eunice helped me pull them all together seamlessly, turning what could have been overwhelming into something joyful and exciting. From the very beginning, she was warm, candid, and genuinely invested in bringing our vision to life. Planning a destination wedding in Puerto Rico while living off-island could have been stressful, but Eunice’s guidance made everything feel effortless. She was our calm in the storm—always kind, patient, and completely in our corner. Our wedding weekend included three different events with countless details, and Eunice handled it all with grace and heart, helping us bring every idea to life and ensuring we got the very best within our budget. The flowers from Pike’s Flower Shop were stunning—lush, vibrant, and full of life—a true reflection of the care she puts into everything. Even after the wedding, when a small vendor issue came up, Eunice stepped in to help, showing the kind of dedication that goes far beyond the big day. She isn’t just a planner—she’s a collaborator, problem-solver, and someone who genuinely cares about her clients. We are forever grateful to Eunice and her incredible team for making our wedding weekend unforgettable.

When I walked into my ceremony and reception I literally sobbed. I met Natalia for the first time a few months before my wedding and she's truly a calming presence but she has impeccable taste and an artistic eye! To be honest, I wasn't 100% sure what I wanted for my decor until the last few weeks of my wedding and Natalia was so patient and kind with me. I sent her a few photos but truly gave her artistic liberty in designing my bouquet, the boutonnieres, and even the candle decor for my reception. But that goes to show how Natalia can meet you once, you have just a few conversations and she just gets it, she knows what you're looking for and that is a level of trust every Bride should have in their vendors. She loves what she does, she AMAZING at it, and I love supporting independent artists on the island and am so honored to have had literally create the decor for the day. I know in the next two years, Natalia is going to be the next big thing in PR so book her now!! Natalia thank you!!
