Fantastic experience with Wedgewood Weddings!

We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue than Stonetree Estate for our big day! The setting is absolutely stunning—lush greenery, beautiful views, great outdoor patio wedding ceremony space, and a wonderfully indoor reception area. A very special shoutout goes to Hannah, our incredible wedding coordinator. From the start, she was attentive, organized, and genuinely invested in making sure our day was exactly how we envisioned it. What truly went above and beyond was her thoughtfulness in capturing photos of the decor as it was being set up. Thank you to the entire team at Wedgewood for making our wedding unforgettable, and an extra big thank you to Hannah for being such a key part of making everything run so smoothly. Highly recommend this venue and team to any couple looking for a beautiful, well-run, and truly special wedding day!

Even more personalized and wonderful than we could have hoped for

My husband and I are so grateful to the Wedgewood team for helping us put together a wedding that was even more beautiful, more personalized, and more special than we could have imagined.  
  
Throughout the whole process, Jackie, our coordinator, was by our side, helping ensure every single element of our wedding was exactly what we wanted, going above and beyond. She was always understanding, accommodating, responsive, bubbly and smiling, making me feel reassured. Jackie and the Chef were very accomodating of food allergies and preferences among our guests. And  
Jackie helped at every corner during the wedding, helping me prep to walk down the aisle, ensuring we were fed and hydrated, helping the photographer get the best pictures, and bustling me before our first dance. We were not expecting such an amazing, high level of service from the team!  
  
The venue turned out even more beautifully than expected and our day was amazing. We enjoyed working with the various vendors that partner with the venue, including the florist, DJ, and lighting. We did not have a good experience with the officiant, but our Wedgewood team was able to step in and help course correct.

The Perfect Wedding Venue!

Absolutely incredible experience and we cannot recommend this venue and the Wedgewood team highly enough! From start to finish they made planning our wedding stress-free and truly enjoyable.  
  
Jackie was our main coordinator and was exceptional. She was so organized, friendly and attentive to every detail. From the moment we met Jackie and went on a tour of the venue we knew this was the place for us. We were operating on a tight timeframe (2 months) so it was truly a team effort from Wedgewood to pull of the wedding of our dreams. We wanted to shout out both Tianna and Hannah who also helped along the way. The meetings we had with all the coordinators made wedding planning fun and not as stressful when you think of pulling off a 2 month wedding! They were super responsive and always available to jump on a call to talk through all the minute details we had along the way. You could tell they all genuinely cared about making our day perfect and went above and beyond to accommodate our requests.  
  
One of the best parts of working with the team at Wedgewood is their all-inclusive package. They made it so easy to customize our day and stay within our budget. The decor of the ceremony area, hallways and reception area was flawless. If something wasn't included in the package, they had vendors that were top-notch. Our guests couldn't stop raving about the setting, the food, and how smoothly everything ran.  
  
Our wedding day was everything we dreamed of and more, thanks to the amazing team at Wedgewood Weddings. If you're looking for a venue with impeccable service, beautiful spaces, and a team that genuinely cares, look no further!

Book with Stonetree ASAP! 

My husband and I toured multiple Wedgewood Venues, but Stonetree was by far our favorite. The beautiful driveway caught our attention right away, it was straight out of a movie. Our initial tour went great, we even spotted an otter in the near by pond which we took as a sign since I work with animals. Planning went smoothly, each email and question was promptly answered in a timely manner. We were given a planning binder as soon as we booked our date, and each detail that the venue needed was specifically asked in the planner. They made it so easy from the very start. When I had a communication issue with another vendor they were there to iron out the wrinkles.   
  
At our final meeting we met with Tianna (who was filling in for our day of venue coordinator), and instantly we clicked. So much so that she requested to switch to be our day of! She brought each vision to life, including when I requested to enter from a different door at the reception, or when I specifically asked if I can have my vendors eat with the rest of the guest so that they were in arms reach.  
  
Tianna also helped run our practice rehearsal and made everybody feel confident about each part of the ceremony and their part. I applaud her for being able to wrangle my crazy family.  
  
The day of the wedding I was introduced to Taylor (our banquet captain), and honestly we were so blessed with a dream team. Taylor was so kind and always made sure we had a drink in our hand. We didn't know about all the small fires they both were able to put out until AFTER our big day, including improvising on seating arrangements, or moving our dessert table from the patio to inside the reception because the wind started to pick up. I was even told by a bridesmaid that Tianna stopped to ask if she was OK since she seemed a bit overwhelmed, and Tianna also created a codeword for another bridesmaid and the bartender who was requesting no alcohol in her drinks. Tianna also took the time to bustle my dress and get me into my party shoes when were running behind during our photoshoot/cocktail hour.   
  
Clean up was also a breeze, Taylor and the rest of the banquet team were able clear up the whole reception so quickly. Taylor was so sweet and personally helped us packed all of our decor items and even packed my husband and I some of the extra food and desserts. She even stayed a bit to chat while we packed up the car. She literally was icing on the cake.  
  
We were beyond impressed by this venue and their team, and received nothing but good reviews by our guest. We cannot recommend them enough!

Dream Wedding

We had our dream wedding made possible by StoneTree by Wedgewood Weddings! The venue was beautiful and well kept. Our day of coordinator, Jackie, helped our big day run so smoothly and everything was perfect. We’ve also worked with Myranda, Kimber, and Tianna throughout the whole planning process and they were professional and helpful. The StoneTree vendor partners were also easy and pleasant to work with. Food and drinks were good and we felt like we got good value for what we paid. Highly recommend!

Amazing wedding with the help of an amazing team!

We recently had the wedding of our dreams at Stonetree Estate! Let me explain why:  
  
The venue location has lots of parking, a beautiful outdoor ceremony/cocktail area, and a large reception space with lots of windows for natural light. Easy to navigate for the guests and provided a good flow from ceremony to reception.  
  
The team (especially Jaclyn and Ava) is organized, friendly, and professional. Every interaction made the planning process stress-free. The guests even complimented how sweet their team was the whole night. Weddings are never 100% perfect, but it was as close as perfect can be to us in all that ways that mattered most.

An amazing experience from start to finish

Finding an affordable Northern California wedding venue with beauty and charm can feel impossible, but we struck gold with Stonetree Estate. From the ceremony site to the photo ops everywhere, this venue blew us away as soon as we toured it.  
  
What sealed the deal was the value. Many comparable venues charge way more without including nearly as many amenities in their packages. The coordinators took so much work off our plates as well with vendor recommendations, floor plans, and setting up decor.  
  
Overall, I can't recommend Stonetree Estate highly enough to couples planning NorCal weddings. Between the unbeatable value, gorgeous details, and wonderful staff, you will not have to compromise beauty for budget here! We had an amazing day!

Dream Venue and Team

Our big day was perfect!  
  
My (now) husband and I have nothing but the best to say about the Stonetree Estate team... Myranda (our coordinator) took everything off our shoulders so that we could relax and enjoy our wedding. The venue was beautiful... the food was amazing and the cake from Krumbs Cakes was one of the highlights of the night!

Fantastic Experience

Fantastic experience! Do your homework, come prepared, and make sure to check in and fill out every sheet in the planner - it will help the coordinators do an even better job. We missed the food tasting, but as it turns out, it didn't matter, because the food was fantastic! We had so many people (30+) say it was the best filet mignon they've ever had, and the wedding they've ever attended! We did put in a fair amount of time and money ourselves, but it was well worth the effort. Just make sure to keep communicating with the coordinators, and keep calm when things don't necessary go the way you think. Pro tip: Tiana is the best. If you get lucky enough to have her as your day-of coordinator, you're in great hands!
