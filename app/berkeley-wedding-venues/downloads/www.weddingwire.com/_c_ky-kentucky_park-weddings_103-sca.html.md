My husband and I got married here in October and the venue was absolutely breathtaking. My guests went on and on the entire time about how gorgeous the wedding was. Meagan and her staff were absolutely amazing and also allowed our pups to be part of the wedding. We had Olive Garden cater in (saved us a ton and was easy set up for them) and didn’t run into a single issue the day of. It was genuinely everything I could have ever asked for. I would recommend this place over and over again! Thank you so much Lost River team!

Josh and his team at Oak Hill Gardens were absolutely incredible, and choosing them as our wedding venue was the best decision we could have made. From the very beginning, Josh listened closely to what my fiancé and I envisioned and supported us every step of the way, from food and florals to finding the perfect DJ, cake, desserts, and even hair and makeup. He was there for every decision, whether I wanted to include or skip something “traditional,” and guided us with his professional expertise to make sure our day reflected us. On our wedding day, everything was beautiful, stress-free, and unforgettable. Josh and his team went above and beyond to make sure we were actually enjoying ourselves, they kept the day running smoothly, made sure we always had a drink in hand, and ensured we had the best time celebrating. The hospitality, professionalism, and overall atmosphere were beyond anything we could have hoped for. I was most anxious about the florals and decorations because of how picky I can be but Josh understood exactly the floral vision and vibe I wanted and executed it perfectly. The food was outstanding, the desserts and cake were delicious, and we received countless compliments from our guests about how gorgeous the venue was and how excellent everything tasted. We are so thankful to Oak Hill Gardens for giving us the wedding of our dreams. I could not have asked for a better venue or team to bring it all together, we truly love this place!

This is my home church growing up. It has a gorgeous, large sanctuary (holds about 350 people) and I was able to use it for free (just pay the wonderful woman who cleans for us to come in a couple days extra). There is a beautiful narthex and a ladies parlor that is perfect for cloistering the bride away before the wedding. There's a huge balcony that's perfect for a videographer to tape from, and large wings for secondary cameras. I love the church and it was beautiful on my wedding day! (Does NOT have a center aisle!)

We could not have picked a more PERFECT venue for our wedding! It was an absolute dream!! Mark and his team keep the gardens meticulously maintained. Everything was perfect, lush and green - it was a magical place to get married. We are so happy we found the Gardens at Ray Eden! I enjoyed working with Mark. He was responsive, accommodating, helpful and incredibly kind. He made sure our day was absolutely perfect and never got frustrated with my many calls and questions.

It has always been my Dream to get married in Bernheim Forest. And recently I was able to put one of their buildings on hold for the venue for my upcoming Medieval period themed wedding. Gina was a pleasure to work with and was always prompt and courteous in her correspondences. Unfortunately, I was forced to cancel my wedding and Gina was very professional in sending out the Refund to me in a timely manner. (Hard to get married with a Medieval period theme when your dressmaker has yet to send me the dress I ordered back in February of 2016) But when and IF I ever receive my Medieval period dress I WILL definitely be contacting Gina again, and putting a deposit down on the venue again. The Forest is Gorgeous and well taken care of, the buildings are perfect for the needs of my wedding as are the grounds. I can't wait to make my Fairy tale wedding a reality and Bernheim is a Major part in that.
