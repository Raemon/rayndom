5.0 out of 5 rating 

5.0 

We had DJ Steven for our LOTR wedding, and he was one of the most unexpectedly magical parts of the whole day. Not only did he hop on board with our theme, decking out himself, his booth, and getting us glow in the dark crystals, but his wife also crochet us an adorable Gandalf! The music was exactly what I asked for and he caught onto vibes immediately. My venue was somewhat notorious for being difficult to work with, but Steven put us at ease and made sure we were able to simply enjoy our day. He has a brilliant trick for getting everyone on the dance floor at the beginning of the night, and was overall just so kind, passionate, and fun. So grateful I went with this vendor, and recommended you do the same!!

I cannot say enough incredible things about Joshua Fields of Music by J Fields. As both a bride and a seasoned luxury event planner, I went into my own wedding knowing exactly how high the bar needed to be. When you live in this industry, you don’t get the luxury of hiring “good enough” — you hire the best. Joshua didn’t just meet the bar, he raised it. From the very beginning, his professionalism and process stood out. Before the wedding, Joshua scheduled a thoughtful consultation call with us to truly understand our vision, our vibe, and the kind of experience we wanted our guests to have. He didn’t skim the surface — he asked intentional questions about music preferences, cultural moments, emotional beats, and flow. He also collaborated seamlessly with our event coordinator, which made the entire production feel cohesive and elevated. On top of that, he uses an innovative app that allowed us to upload and organize our music selections in a way I’ve honestly never seen in the industry. Most DJs still rely on basic spreadsheets — this felt modern, streamlined, and reflective of someone who genuinely cares about client experience. The day of the wedding, Joshua’s impact was felt immediately. The transition from ceremony to reception was flawless. The moment our officiant exited, Joshua confidently stepped in with the microphone, warmly welcoming guests and setting the tone for the night ahead. He gave clear, polished directions for cocktail hour, built excitement for the evening, and made everyone feel like they were part of something special. It didn’t feel like announcements — it felt like hosting. And that’s really the difference: Joshua is not just a DJ, he is an elite emcee and host. He made the entire night feel like a high-end gala. Guests repeatedly told us how VIP the experience felt and how incredible our emcee was. I couldn’t agree more. One of the most meaningful and impactful details was his execution of walk-up music for each person giving a toast. This elevated every speaker and made each moment feel intentional and celebrated. For my mom’s walk-up, Joshua played “I Can’t Get No Satisfaction” by The Rolling Stones — my late father’s favorite song. That moment was deeply emotional and personal, and Joshua handled it with such care and thoughtfulness. He didn’t just press play — he honored the moment. Visually and professionally, he also showed up fully aligned with our design. Our dress code was Shades of Love, and Joshua came dressed to the nines in a stunning merlot-colored suit that complemented our aesthetic beautifully. His DJ team matched the same level of polish, and the overall presence added to the elevated atmosphere of the night. And when it came time for the reception? The dance floor was alive. We specifically requested 2000s R&B all night, and Joshua delivered perfectly. The energy never dipped. The transitions were smooth, the pacing was spot-on, and the floor stayed moving. He seamlessly balanced being on the mic as a host while also getting on the mixer himself and reading the room like a true professional. From a bride’s perspective, from a planner’s perspective, from a design-forward perspective, and from an industry expert’s perspective — Joshua is exceptional. I recommend Music by J Fields without hesitation. If you want your event to feel elevated, intentional, seamless, and unforgettable, hire Joshua.

Sonja absolutely crushed it as our wedding DJ! From start to finish she was professional, fun, and totally in tune with the vibe we wanted. The dance floor was packed all night, and even people outside the venue were raving about the music. If you want a DJ who brings the best energy, Sonja’s the one!

Our wedding DJ, Jai, was an absolute hit! He was fantastic to work with from our very first meeting; Jai took the time to understand our vision and the vibe we wanted for our wedding. Jai went above and beyond to create a heartwarming memory. In last-minute preparation for the ceremony, our family collected audio recordings from both of our grandmothers who lived in different countries and couldn’t travel. Jai graciously worked to include their messages without any issue and maintained the surprise until the reveal. Jai is not just a DJ; he's a true professional who knows how to read a crowd and create an unforgettable experience. We received so many compliments from our guests about how great the music was. He was a huge part of what made our wedding so perfect. We can't recommend him enough!

We don't even know where to start! From the very beginning, Ryan made the entire process so easy and enjoyable. He took the time to really get to know us, our music taste, and the kind of atmosphere we wanted for our wedding — and absolutely brought it to life. Day of Ryan was so much more than a DJ, acting as an impromptu day of coordinator he offered suggestions and the experience to make our day effortless. while running the mic he made sure everything stayed on schedule, and offered suggestions when things ran longer than expected; all while offering at every opportunity to help out with anything we needed. Every moment was perfect — from the ceremony music that had everyone tearing up, to the smooth transitions during dinner, and then the dance floor that stayed packed all night long. Ryan read the crowd like a pro, mixing our favorite songs with just the right energy to keep every guest — young and old — on their feet. We had so many people come up to us throughout the night and afterward saying, “That was the best wedding DJ we’ve ever seen!” And we couldn’t agree more. Thank you, Ryan, for going above and beyond to make our day so special. Your professionalism, positivity, and passion for what you do truly shine through. You didn’t just play music — You made creating the moments and the memories the focus and that's something we will cherish always.

We were debating for a while whether we wanted to hire a DJ for sound or just make a playlist on spotify and play from there, and eventually we decided to book DJ Dan to make it one less thing for us to worry about. And OMG, BEST DECISION EVER!! He made this process fun and so easy! He has a lot of experience and it shows through his conversations and recommendations. He set up both an indoor and outdoor sound set up for our ceremony and indoor reception, brought lighting that set the mood, and MC'd the reception with jokes that had everyone laughing! When the dance floor opened up he kept the good vibes flowing and was able to read the room easily to play what kept us and our guests on the dancefloor. Such a genuine and sweet person and the memories of dancing the best day of our lives away is blessed with the work of DJ Dan!

We are so happy we booked Anthony for our wedding! The whole process with him was so smooth and he met all of our requests flawlessly. He was so easy to work with and made us feel so confident that he had everything covered. His online planning tool was extremely helpful in the time leading up to the day. On the day of, Anthony kept the energy up all night and made things so easy on our officiant and speakers. Can’t recommend his services enough!

DJ Aquaman came to us as a recommendation from our wedding planner. Working with Eric on our wedding music vibes was one of our favorite parts of wedding planning! Eric was our emcee for our entire day from ceremony to reception so there was a lot to think about when it came to how the day flowed. Eric gave us direction as well as pro tips in a pre-event meeting that helped us focus on all the stages of the wedding. In the end, our wedding went super smooth, the audio was perfect throughout and he got folks sweating on the dance floor in the 90 degree heat! We couldn't be happier!
