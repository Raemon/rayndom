## About

Ralston Hall Mansion is a registered National Historic Landmark built by William Chapman Ralston in 1867. While the interior of the mansion is currently closed pending renovation, the lawn and grounds are available for a lovely outdoor ceremony with the mansion as the backdrop.. Ralston Hall is one of the Peninsula's few mansion locations and is a beautiful venue for a sophisticated and memorable wedding and/or reception.

Our large chapel featuring museum quality stained glass is also available for services.

For a more intimate reception, the Taube Center, at the entrance to the University is newly renovated. Originally the local parish chapel, it is sleek and modern while keeping its original charm. It is ADA accessible, with bathrooms and parking.

Ralston mansion is absolutely gorgeous and when we found out that it was possible to have our wedding there, it was a dream come true. We had our wedding there the day after Thanksgiving on a Friday in the afternoon and I am an NDNU graduate, so we were able to rent it out for a very affordable price. The coordinators Denise and Karen are very easy to work with and they are always available to help with any questions or concerns. They both went our of their way on different occasions to help us with different parts of the planning process. Also, the "day of" coordinator that they had, I believe her name was Nicole, was very sweet and helpful. Ralston Hall was an awesome venue, we couldn't have asked for a more perfect or more beautiful venue. It is a wonderful place.

We got married at Ralston Hall on New Year's Eve at 7pm. I couldn't have imagined a better place to get married. The mansion and grounds are so well kept and it feels just magical in there. The wedding coordinators are certainly professional and they know there stuff. They can answer questions on just about anything and give you recommendations. They were also helpful the day of in giving us guidance on keeping the event on-time and flowing. My guests were so impressed with the venue! Check out the webstie but go and visit because it is breathtaking in person. What a fairytale place!

Both Karen & Denise are very friendly, but the venue itself is quite pricy!

The place is gorgeous. It is a bit pricey, but at the end it is totally worth it.   
It is a good place to have your wedding at if you have around 100-120 guests.   
The event coordinators are helpful. You can call them millions of times and they will always help you.
