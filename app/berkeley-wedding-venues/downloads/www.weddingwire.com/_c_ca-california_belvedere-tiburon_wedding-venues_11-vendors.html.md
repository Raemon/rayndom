This place was beautiful. We got so many compliments about how great a venue it was and how we even found it. Patty Flax was amazing and very accommodating with all our needs. It’s a must see in person. There are some limitations that can be tricky, like transportation. There is no parking. And guests must be shuttled.

Stunning location for an intimate & unique outdoor wedding ceremony. Incredible value. 180 degree & unobstructed view of Richardson Bay and the golden gate bridge from the top of Tiburon. Easy parking for guests- location is not even known by locals. Weather may be a little overcast and unpredictable but we were blessed with perfect weather in May. Our ceremony was on a Saturday morning - and both the bride and groom managed to get sunburnt! Christine was attentive and easy to work with. Thank you!

We utilized their outdoor venue and it was absolutely breathtaking. Debi, the onsite wedding coordinator was professional and extremely helpful. Highly recommend this venue.

I booked a surprise engagement party on a vessel leaving to/from Tiburon, working closely with Ashley leading up to the event. I have nothing but positive things to say about Ashley & team, everything from planning to day-of logistics went smoothly. All guests had an incredible time sailing past Angel Island, the Golden Gate Bridge, and Sausalito. The bar on- board was great & convenient as well and all the staff members were so friendly. I would absolutely plan another event with Ashley in a heartbeat and if anyone is considering, would highly highly recommend. Thanks to the team for such a special & unforgettable day :)
