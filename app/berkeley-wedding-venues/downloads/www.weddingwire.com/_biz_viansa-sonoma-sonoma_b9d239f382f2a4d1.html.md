Could Not Have Asked For More

Viansa was amazing!! It's so perfect for a wedding from start to finish. It's the only winery in the area with such amazing hillside views, which was perfect for cocktail hour. The staff were incredibly friendly and went above and beyond to make our day perfect. We could not have asked for more!

Perfect Venue

This was the perfect venue for our wedding. The property and views are unmatched, the wine is high quality, and the staff is exceptional. They were responsive, friendly, and flexible. It is also one of the few venues in the area that allows a full bar. Great all around.

A little touch of italy in sonoma county

I cannot recommend Viansa Winery highly enough for anyone looking for a stunning wedding venue. Our wedding was nothing short of magical, thanks to the breathtaking setting and impeccable service provided by Viansa.  
  
A special shoutout to Alyssa, the event coordinator, whose help throughout the planning process was truly exceptional. Her professionalism, attention to detail, and genuine warmth made everything seamless and stress-free. Alyssa’s expertise ensured that every detail was perfectly executed, and we couldn’t have asked for a better experience.  
  
The beauty of Viansa Winery combined with Alyssa’s outstanding support, AND their amazing selections of wine made our special day unforgettable. If you’re considering a venue for your wedding, Viansa Winery is an absolute gem!

Best Wedding Venue in Wine Country!!

I don’t know how we found Viansa when we started looking at wedding venues, but I’m so happy we did! The venue is absolutely stunning - our guests could not stop raving about the location and views. many of our guests were traveling in from out of state and the venue is in such a great location - easy to get to from the Bay Area airports, and close to several of the cities in wine country, so there were lots of hotel options and things for our guests to do while they were in town. We loved the ceremony locations options, the courtyard for the cocktail hour and the indoor reception location was perfect for dinner and dancing. As well, working with Alyssa was amazing, she made the process easy and stress free. I couldn't imagine a better venue for our wedding and cannot wait to come back to visit!

Absolutely Incredible Venue

We got married at Viansa on 7/1/22 and could not have asked for a more perfect, easy to work with venue. The property is breathtakingly gorgeous and you have access to the entire property giving you the options to have your wedding events (ceremony, cocktail, etc) on different parts of the winery. The lead coordinator Victoria is extremely kind, thoughtful and easy to work with. We had multiple guests tell us that Viansa is the prettiest wedding venue they had ever been to!

Amazing venue!

Our wedding at Viansa was just amazing - the winery is so, so beautiful and in a really convenient location for guests coming in from out of town. There were also so many great locations to choose from, which was very convenient since we got married in March and so had to think about rain. The outdoor regions are so beautiful but Viansa also has so many amazing indoor locations. It ended up being cold and rainy on our day, and we got to enjoy some of the outdoor spaces but it was so easy to move big chunks of the wedding indoors at the last minute. Victoria was so amazing and so accommodating and helpful when planning, and she really made sure that everything was perfect. She was also incredibly responsive to both us and our wedding planner, Tara Ybarra, and helped us through the wine selection (including a tasting on the premises beforehand). We couldn't have chosen a better location!!

Stunning venue, great to work with

Viansa is on the pricier side, but it's REALLY hard to beat on location, views, facilities, and service. I think the visuals probably speak for themselves, but I'll say that it was amazing to have a venue where we were actually choosing between *multiple* gorgeous, perfect ceremony/cocktail hour spaces to put our event together!! Victoria was wonderful to work with and super flexible, and they allowed us to borrow (and move!) a lot of stuff they already had on property, which was a big money saver for us!! They were also flexible on things like delivery/pickup timing, event start/end times and all that good stuff - as far as I can remember, everything we needed was a yes. The wine is delicious and not especially expensive for a winery venue, and our pre-wedding tasting (led by the owner!) was tremendously fun. We're big fans of Viansa and will be back to visit whenever we can!!

Dream Wedding come to life

Viansa Sonoma was the PERFECT setting for my wedding. It is a stunning property on a hill overlooking the Sonoma Valley. I fell in love as soon as we went for our site visit. We used the wine cellar/barrel room for the ceremony and the pavilion for the reception. Victoria Campbell is THE BEST. She is so sweet, helpful and accommodating. Very easy to work with and generous about letting us use the furniture they already had. The place is so nice you really don't need to spend a ton on sprucing it up, styling or flowers. Your guests will be amazed by the place. We got married in the middle of the Coronavirus (just before the shelter in place directive) and we are grateful that Viansa stayed open just long enough for us to have our celebration. Wish we could do it again, day went by so fast. Thank you to Victoria and everyone on the Viansa Team for making our special day even more incredible!

We've been honored to provide our DJing, Photobooth, and lighting services at Viansa Winery for several years. It is absolutely one of our favorite venues in Sonoma! It's higher elevation delivers a spectacular view of the valley below. It's uniquely charactered spaces allow couples to choose various scenic choices for their ceremony. Most importantly we LOVE working with the people there. Meredith, Courtney, and rest of the wedding coordination team is super fun, and easy to work with. They are very friendly, and laid back, yet super organized and professional which make them great to work with. If you are looking for a wine country wedding experience, definitely stop at Viansa!

They say the three most important things about hosting an event are location, location, location. While it's not completely true, location is nevertheless one of the key factors that can literally make or break your party. We've been working with Viansa on a number of occasions, and all we can say is "We love you, Viansa Winery!" The breathtaking view of Sonoma Valley, abundant selection of great wines, friendly and attentive staff - we can go on and on. But it's better to see once than to hear 100 times, so take a trip to this magic place and see for yourself why it should be your number one choice for any event!
