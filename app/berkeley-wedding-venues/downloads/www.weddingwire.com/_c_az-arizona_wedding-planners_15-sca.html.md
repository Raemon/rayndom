5.0 out of 5 rating 

5.0 

Glitters and Giggles was an absolute lifesaver during my wedding planning process, especially when it came to the planning details for both my wedding and bachelorette party. They helped bring my ideas together, thought through logistics I hadn’t even considered, and made everything feel fun and stress-free instead of overwhelming. Their creativity, organization, and attention to detail truly made a difference, and I felt so supported every step of the way. If you’re looking for someone who genuinely cares about making your events special and seamless, I can’t recommend Glitters and Giggles enough!

I had the great honor of working alongside Sloane and her team at a wedding last weekend. Her calm confidence was ever present, orchestrating this once in a lifetime event. She put everyone at ease and each step was done with the upmost care. All the wedding vendors knew her and adored her. Everyone worked so well as a team, across the vendors, under her leadership. Having planned over 500 weddings, her experience is immense, yet her care is still individual. She truly knew the couple and went above and beyond taking care of so many extra details for them. Her passion for her work is palatable, as you can see the joy it brings her to be supporting their momentous day. I highly recommend Events by Sloane to support your wedding day with proficiency, diligence and upmost care.

We are beyond grateful for Dash Event Company and our incredible Day of Coordinators, Ashley and Danielle. From the moment we booked, they were consistently communicative, supportive, and ready to help with any question or concern. Their professionalism and kindness put us at ease throughout the entire planning process. Our wedding was at the Royal Palms, and we unexpectedly experienced a power outage, every couple’s worst nightmare. But Ashley and Danielle handled it with absolute grace. They kept us and our guests calm, reassured, and even entertained during one of the most stressful moments imaginable. They coordinated seamlessly with all of our vendors, and thanks to them, my husband and I didn’t have to worry about a single thing. The rest of the Dash team that joined them on our wedding day also went above and beyond. Their attention to detail, organization, and genuine care for making our day perfect did not go unnoticed. We truly wouldn’t have hired anyone else. Dash Event Company is exceptional, and we are so incredibly grateful to have had their team by our side on the most important day of our lives. Highly, highly recommend! 💛 thank you ladies!!!

I wish I could leave more than 5 stars for Ellie, as she was amazing and hands down the best decision we made with our wedding process! Ellie was an absolute dream to work with! She kept us organized and excited through every step of planning. She truly blew us away was in the final days leading up to the wedding because when we saw rain in the forecast, we were stressed. Ellie immediately stepped in and made miracles happen within just a few days pivoting our entire ceremony indoors. She redesigned our layout, coordinated with all the vendors within a few hours a new plan, and handled every detail so seamlessly that our wedding day turned out even more beautiful than we imagined. Ellie made it so that we were able to fully enjoy our day without a single worry. Her professionalism, creativity, and genuine care made all the difference. We can’t recommend her enough. If you want someone who will go above and beyond for you, Ellie is ABSOLUTELY the planner to hire!!

Mandy and her team were incredibly helpful throughout the planning process with us especially for being out of state brides. They always had our best interest in mind and communicated with us every step of the way. Unfortunately, we had to make the difficult decision to cancel our wedding due to COVID-19. However, their level of service was outstanding from start to finish. They went above and beyond their responsibilities by contacting all of our vendors to try to get our money refunded. It's been a very difficult time for us, but we appreciated their continued help even knowing we could no longer have our special day planned by them. It’s rare to see a company care about their customers in this manner, but we’re thankful for their understanding and for supporting our decision. If any couples are looking for a top-notch planner, we highly recommend Mandy Marie Creative.

OMG! I loved my planner! Hesok and Dominique are so incredible. These ladies listen to what you want and fulfilled my wishes. They were always in communication with my vendors and made sure my wedding was smooth. One of the vendors didn’t know where to go because I literally forgot to tell them the location! To my amazement Hesok had contacted the rental company 2 weeks before the wedding and already had provided the location and I was just beyond grateful. I am so happy and blessed that I did that free consultation and talked, hired her, and loved her from then on.

Evin at Laki Events was instrumental in ensuring our wedding day went smoothly! Even as a type A, hyper-organized bride her experience, understanding of the wedding industry and ability to make sure everything went seamless the day of the wedding were invaluable. She went above and beyond to make our planning process easier - from putting finishing touches on our decor to returning our rentals. Plus, she made the entire experience more fun and was a joy to work with!

We knew that we were going to need a planner for the wedding as we were also going to organizing 3 auxiliary celebrations. Bloom and Blueprint really went above and beyond for not only the florals and decor, but also the planning itself. We had the absolute honor to work with Casey and she truly was a cut above the rest. A fierce advocate, a hard worker, a great listener, and super organized to boot. The entire event rested on her shoulders and she performed better than I ever could have asked. People in my family who were skeptical about hiring a planner were absolutely won over by how instrumental Casey was to getting anything rolling. I truly cannot emphasize this enough, Casey is worth every penny. I repeat, every penny. Thank you Casey, you really are special to us and I'm so glad you could help make our special day that much better.

The wedding we envisioned could not have been achieved without Shauna! She was an absolute lifesaver from the moment we hired her, to well after midnight on the big day. From the beginning, Shauna was incredibly organized and on top of every detail, no matter how small. She took the time to understand our vision and help us navigate the various planning details. On the wedding day itself, Shauna was a complete rockstar. She managed all the vendors,and handled any last-minute issues with grace and professionalism - allowing us to fully enjoy our day without any stress. Our friends and family were all so impressed with how effortlessly everything flowed, and it was all thanks to her. If you're looking for a day-of planner who is professional, kind, and exceptional at what she does, look no further than Shauna. She truly is the best!
