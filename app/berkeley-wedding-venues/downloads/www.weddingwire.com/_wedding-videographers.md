## Wedding Videography

Your wedding is going to be one of the most memorable days of your life. It's that very special day where you come together with your partner and commit to one another in front of friends and family. You’ll want to relive it again and again – but your wedding day can feel like a blur. With so much going on and all the emotions involved, it’s easy to forget some of the most treasured parts of your ceremony and [reception](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-venues). That’s why you may want to hire a wedding videographer to capture it all.

Whether you want to replay your father’s toast or catch your brother-in-law breakdancing to the live band, wedding videography lets you do just that. You can rewind and take in your first kiss or watch the conga line you missed while you were in another room.

What’s more, documenting your wedding on film is a great way to share the occasion with friends or family who couldn’t attend. Send a copy in the mail or host a viewing party and watch the film together. From the moments you might have missed to the ones you want to cherish again, a wedding video may be just what you need.

## Know Your Options

While every videographer likely has different packages, you should end up with a high-quality video and copies for those who want them. Of course, you can speak with the videographer to find the one that best suits your preferences.

Not everyone wants or needs videography for their wedding, and we know it's an added expense; the average cost in the U.S being $1,658 (though it varies depending on location). But if professional wedding videography is right for you, here are some things to consider when choosing the best videographer.

## Questions to Ask Your Wedding Videographer

Finding a wedding videographer is much like finding the perfect [wedding photographer](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photographers), and you can ask similar questions of both.

Do some research. Look through their portfolio and see if anything resonates with you. This will give you an idea of their style and will help you determine if they are a good fit for filming your wedding.

Next, find out about their experience and background. You may not want to hire someone who has only done one or two jobs. Ask questions around how long they have been in the business and how many weddings they film each year. It may also be nice to know whether they are familiar with your wedding venue. The more experienced they are, the more comfortable you will feel working with them.

Another good question to ask is if they know your photographer and whether they have worked together before. This is by no means a requirement, but can be an added bonus. Ask about their camera equipment and if there will be more than one camera person or videographer.

Finally, it is always important to inquire about pricing and packages. Find out how they charge and what's included other than just raw footage. You will want to know what exactly you are paying for and what you can expect in your wedding video. Not everyone needs ten copies with all the bells and whistles, but it's important to know how much money to set aside for your desired results.
