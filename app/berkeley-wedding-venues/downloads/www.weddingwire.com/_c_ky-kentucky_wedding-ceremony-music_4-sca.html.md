Highland Chambers string Quartet played at our wedding ceremony and cocktail hour! Ray was an absolute gem and easy to coordinate and work with. A week out from our wedding we still hadn't nailed down the processional and recessional songs. Highland Chambers handled our last minute requests with ease and gave awesome recommendations. We chose you're in love by Taylor Swift for the processional song and viva Lavida by Coldplay for the recessional song. Our guests could not stop raving about how beautifully they played! It was fun for the guest to hear modern Pop songs played acoustically. I 1000% percent would recommend them for any wedding. They are the absolute best! Thanks again guys, you made our wedding wonderful!

Beth is such an amazing musician and a wonderful person to work with. She is genuine, professional, and kind. She took my daughter's wishes for the music and made them even more magical than we had imagined. Many guests complimented her piano skills as well as her vocal talent. My daughter's wedding just simply would not have been as special without Beth's involvement. Hiring Beth Dean Music was one of the absolute best wedding decisions we made.

We hired Electria for our ceremony and cocktail hour -- and they were wonderful! We got to pick the songs and order for each event from a large selection of electric and acoustic songs. Electria also learned two songs for our bride entrance and recessional. They were so easy to work with and we received numerous comments from our guests about how much they enjoyed their electric pop renditions during our cocktail hour. If you're looking for a great string trio for your event, hire them!

Kay performed beautifully for our wedding in Marengo Cave on 9/20/25. She was very flexible and passionate about making our vision for our wedding ceremony come to life. Kay played the cello inside the cave and the acoustics only enhanced her already beautiful talent. She even learned 2 new songs for us not even a week before our wedding! You can tell she has a true passion for her music. We would definitely recommend Classical Choice Strings to anyone as we had a very positive experience working with Kay.
