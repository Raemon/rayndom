When I approached Chris on short notice with regards to entertainment for my wedding, I thought he would either charge me a ridiculous price or be unavailable. On the contrary, Chris was very accommodating and reasonably priced! He was even willing to learn the song I wanted to walk down the aisle to in 3 days. I recommend him and use him over and over again for any event
