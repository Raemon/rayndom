Easy and efficient! 

Cartalia made the whole save the date process easy and efficient!   
I have gotten SO many compliments on our Save the Dates!   
The quality is high and the item was as described, they even helped me coordinate our wedding website being written on the back of the card.   
My expectations were met and surpassed!   
Can't endorse this product and the company enough!

The most beautiful wedding invites we ever could have imagined! 

We worked with Cartalia to design a custom wedding invitation and they far surpassed our wildest expectations. From the initial consultation to the final product arriving at our door, they were a dream to work with. I really appreciated how open to feedback they were while sharing their expertise to achieve our vision. Our friends and family are wowed and we feel lucky to have gotten to create and send something so beautiful to them. I am SO thankful for Cartalia! Highly highly highly recommend!!!

Love the Golden Monogram!

Could not be happier with our invitations! They are truly perfect.   
We created a monogram with the crest where they were able to make the monogram gold foil and the crest in gold print. It couldn't have come out more perfect! Highly recommend!

The absolute best

I can not begin to explain how amazingly beautiful these Save the Dates are! They are simple, elegant but yet such a statement.   
Delivery was super fast and all individual magnets were protected before being perfectly packed.   
A huge thank you for creating our perfect save the dates!

Beautiful cards

So we received our cards this weekend and they simply exceeded our expectations.   
They are very beautiful so so beautiful that wanted to keep some as spare but hadn’t realised we needed to order in bulk to do so which is a little disappointing.   
The process of correction and approving the card was very efficient and clear and you get a few amends which is nice! The delivery for us was a little frustrating although we received them before we were meant to the dates were not clear and were changed a few times which meant we made plans and had to change them so feedback would be make sure delivery is clear and throw in a handful of spares or an option to purchase maybe 5 extra rather than the minimum 30. We would highly recommend the invitations, I’ve had so many over my years and to send these out I could not be prouder. BW
