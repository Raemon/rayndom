Truly the best experience I would highly recommend this company to future brides! We had so much fun with the Photo Booth during our reception and that’s all thanks to Jacqueline!!! She was so amazing to work with. Extremely clear communication throughout the entire process, which I sincerely appreciate. She made my husband and I feel so special on our big day. She was so kind to our guests (who all raved about the Photo Booth)!!! 10/10 would recommend to anyone who is looking for a great company to work with!

We rented this for a reunion. Everyone loved it. Caylee came and set up the photo booth, explained it all very clearly and provided the very best service along the way - answering texts promptly and any silly questions we had. I think it's important that Blooming Moments started this biz to help people afford a booth rental. Hers was far less! I couldn't have done it if I hadn't found her. And she is fantastic! Let's reward the kind, nice people on the planet and rent this for any occasion.

Highly recommend Everyday Elegance! They were such a great addition to our wedding reception. They were so easy to work with, and offered such amazing products! They truly were one of the best decisions we made for our wedding reception.

I worked with L.A. Photo Booths for my son's grade school class graduation party. The setup was seamless, the photo quality was excellent, and the staff was incredibly friendly and professional. Our guests had a blast using the booth, and the props were a huge hit. Highly recommend for any event — they truly went above and beyond!

These guys are top notch! They collect all of the photos and make an amazing book for you. We did this in place of a traditional guest book. They were so professional. They even made the photo strips have a custom border to go with our wedding colors. They were friendly to our guests and were so fun everyone wanted to go back for many trips to the open air booth—which was fine because they offered unlimited pictures for the whole night! Would highly recommend!

Heather (Kristen's assistant) did a wonderful job manning our photobooth. The whole process went super smoothly, and our guests had a great time with the props! They even made us a guest book of the pictures to remember the night by. We would definitely hire them again!

We used Event DOC for my daughter's wedding in May, and I would give the team double the stars if I could! They truly thought of EVERYTHING to make the day of our wedding seamless -- the entire wedding party was able to relax and immerse themselves in the celebration, and Event DOC took care of managing all the vendors, the transportation, finalizing the table set-ups and dessert tables -- pretty much everything! They were magicians in sorting through logistics and keeping everyone dry throughout an unexpectedly rainy day. The team is a lot of fun to work with, helpful, knowledgeable and highly professional. They were so invested in making it the memory of a lifetime for my daughter. Thanks Heather and Jules -- you are the BEST!!!
