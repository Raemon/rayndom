## The Comfiest Wedding Day Underwear for the Groom

The last thing you want is to feel uncomfortable on your wedding day. To help make sure you only feel your best, we've listed our favorite groom underwear right here.

Men's wedding underwear should fit comfortably under a suit or tuxedo, which is why we love this snug pair of boxer briefs designed to contour to your body. A smart inner pouch offers support and prevents chafing, while breathable mesh helps to control the temperature. If that's not enough, these stylish boxer briefs also have a unique horizontal fly allowing for quick and easy access when nature calls—trust us, you'll appreciate it on such a busy day.
