Eric and his team are the most professional, personable, amazing wedding DJs we could have ever asked for. He made us feel so comfortable and taken care of leading up to our wedding day. He talked to each of our guests who were giving speeches and made them feel comfortable and taken care of. He was so involved in the day that many of our guests thought he was our wedding planner. He did a great job of checking in with us throughout the day and threw a great dance party despite our guests’ hesitancy to get on the dance floor. Eric worked seamlessly with our photo/video team to ensure that they got all of the content they needed. Ultimately, Eric did an amazing job. We would recommend him to anyone and would hire him again in a heartbeat. We have nothing but amazing praise for Eric and AK Professional Entertainment.

A lot of the DJ's that we contacted were pushy and arrogant. When we first connected with Mike, he was down to earth and all about "US". We asked him to officiate our ceremony as well as be our DJ, The ceremony was perfect. He paid attention to everything we wanted and focused on all the details. His years of experience was evident He quickly answered calls and emails at all hours of the day .He also met with us when we needed to get a hands on feel for how things would work logistically. Mike treated us as though we were his only wedding of the year, and provided us with great memories, along with all the help he gave us along the way. After the ceremony, he made a perfect transition from officiate to DJ. We couldn't have asked for a better DJ, He goes a step beyond to make sure everything goes smoothly from start to finish. Our night was a success because of him.

Glenn did a fabulous job at my wedding. He was very in tune with what music my guests responded to, and played all of the songs I asked for at just the right times. He was super easy to work with and kept the party going. I even stayed longer than I had planned to because I was having so much fun dancing. Thank you Glenn!!

Mike was beyond amazing! He kept the wedding flowing smoothly and everyone was up dancing! I had multiple guests come up to me and comment on how good a dj he is, and he even convinced my sister of the importance of a good dj. Beyond that, he went above and beyond by helping transport additional decorations for my wedding planner. I would hire him again in a heartbeat!
