Wonderful experience!

I had a wonderful experience with Duo Design Celebrations. I do not have an eye for design myself but had an idea for the style and color scheme I was looking for. They were able to take that and design absolutely beautiful invitations that included rehearsal dinner invites, and detail cards that incorporate the design, our flowers and venues!

So many compliments!

Christa was so much fun to work with! I had experienced her gorgeous work at two previous weddings. She immediately understood the vibe we were going for, our guests raved about every single one of her fabulous touches for our daughters wedding.

Daughters Wedding 

Christa did our daughter's Meghan and Brian's wedding invitations that were amazing. She is very easy to work with and is always excited to show you what she thinks will work well. Very professional and up for anything you want her to create!
