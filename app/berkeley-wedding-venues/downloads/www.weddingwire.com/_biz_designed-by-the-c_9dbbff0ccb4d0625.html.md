Beautiful Pieces and So Enjoyable to Work With!

Carolyn (Designed by the C) was the most wonderful and easy to work with vendor throughout our entire wedding planning. From start to finish Carolyn delivered such creative and beautiful pieces that tied our whole wedding together. We really appreciated how she listened and communicated with us, while providing her own input. She was so flexible and open to ideas, and made a point to be on time with her deadlines. From our hand painted save the dates to our sailboat guest table cards, Carolyn worked tirelessly and thoughtfully to make sure our wedding day was so special. Carolyn never hesitated to set up a call or send us a draft of what she was thinking. Her detailed plan for each item we were asking for made the whole process seamless. We will continue to recommend Carolyn and Designed by the C to our friends and family for years to come and cannot wait to continue working with her in the future!

Most Talented Human Ever

Working with Carolyn on our wedding invitations was one of the best decisions we made during our planning process. Her creativity and talent are unmatched! Every element of our invitations was the perfect reflection of us as a couple — from the design and color palette to the small custom touches that made each piece of the suite feel so special. Our guests can’t stop talking about how gorgeous they are!  
  
Working with Carolyn was not only easy and fun, but genuinely inspiring — she has a true gift for turning ideas into art. Her work is timeless, personal, and absolutely breathtaking. She went above and beyond to ensure everything was perfect and I cannot recommend her highly enough!

Watercolor dream 

Carolyn was an incredible vendor to work with. We connected with her after a mutual friend knew we wanted a water color, multi piece wedding invitation suite. Once we saw Carolyn’s previous work we knew she had the exact type of watercolor artistry we were looking for. We had a destination wedding and wanted our guests to open our invitation and feel like they were transported to our wedding location. Carolyn achieved that perfectly and helped us prioritize what we wanted to showcase image wise. She was also very receptive to tiny edits we wanted to make to a map piece, as accuracy was very important to us. All in all we were so pleased to work with Carolyn. She was organized, clear, easy to work with, amenable and above all else a very talented artist!

Such a special part of our day! 

Carolyn was the absolute best to work with. I had no idea what I was looking for when I started and she worked with me to create the most perfect invitations that matched us and our story perfectly 🤍. The invites mean so much to us and we have a copy framed in our house that we’ll cherish forever. We get endless compliments as well. Highly, highly recommend working with Carolyn!

The Absolute BEST

My husband and I could not be happier with our decision to work with Carolyn for all the paper goods and stationary involved with our wedding. She was by far the BEST vendor that we used. The quality of her work is unmatched, her creations are literally works of art. We have our save the date framed in our home and are still receiving compliments about our invitations months later. Carolyn was an absolute pleasure to work with, she listened to all our ideas and visions and she created something even more amazing than my husband and I ever could’ve imagined. It is very obvious while working with Carolyn that she cares about her clients and making all their dreams come to life. We cannot recommend her enough and look forward to working with her again in the future!

Obsessed with our invitation suite! 

Carolyn beautifully executed my vision for an elegant and unique invitation suite. She was professional, timely, and gracious - even when I changed the design direction close to the deadline. The suite really set the design aesthetic for our entire wedding. She turned a photo of our engagement spot into a beautiful watercolor, which now serves as a personal art piece in our home.

Best & Easiest Wedding Decision

We absolutely loved working with and getting to know Carolyn. Not only is she genuine and kindhearted, she listened to all of the details we were interested in and delivered the most unique artwork in the form of our wedding invites. The entire process was seamless and truly the best (& easiest) decision we made!  
We loved our invite so much we leveraged her to pull together a custom dance floor template for us.

Carolyn is a magician! 

Working with Carolyn for our wedding paper goods and signage was fantastic! She was collaborative, responsive, and professional. She made our vision come to life, and more. I'll never forget the moment that I held our physical wedding invites in my hand — they were absolutely perfect and everything we dreamed of. All of the items that Carolyn created were unique and memorable, and w are so grateful for her partnership.
