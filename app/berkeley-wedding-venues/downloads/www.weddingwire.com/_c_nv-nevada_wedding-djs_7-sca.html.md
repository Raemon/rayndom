Tony did a great job keeping my daughter's wedding rolling. We had compliments from guests and enjoyed our evening. He was very flexible to accommodate our vision for the wedding and capable of taking over where we had planning gaps.

Jeff did an excellent job! Planning for a wedding can get quite hectic, but Jeff made the music part simple and worry free. It was easy to get in touch with him throughout the planning process, and he was always ready to make adjustments to match our needs. He was very friendly and accommodating. Thanks to Jeff, the music kept flowing, and the wedding reception turned out to be a blast!

Jay was absolutely incredible and made our wedding night so seamless and unforgettable. His energy was amazing, his attention to detail was unmatched, and the music was pure perfection from start to finish. He knew exactly how to read the crowd and kept the vibe going all night long. We couldn’t have asked for a better DJ! Jay truly went above and beyond to make our night everything we dreamed of!

My husband and I hired Milton for our October 2025 wedding in Lake Tahoe and he was absolutely fantastic to work with. I cannot say enough positive things about Milton. Milton's passion for music really shines through in his work as he created such an exciting environment for ourselves and our guests. He provided our pre-ceremony, ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception music and at every point elevated the atmosphere. We were an adult only wedding and he was able to mesh music geared toward different age groups seamlessly. He was very easy to work with and very thorough when it came to our music wants and needs. His priority was to involve us prior to, and during our event, to deliver a musical experience exactly how we envisioned it- and boy did he do just that. We had guest after guest continually praise the music throughout our event, which my husband and I loved hearing. His talent for DJ'ing is evident the moment he starts playing his set. What we loved most about having Milton as our DJ was his unique ability to blend his DJ skills with other musicians as we had a "hybrid DJ" that included a saxophonist and trumpeter- that was a game changer. The hybrid DJ aspect was really unique and made our reception so much more lively and fun. My husband and I were already so excited to see what Milton could provide us prior to our wedding and cannot express how even more thrilled we were after experiencing his services firsthand. He truly knows how to bring the party. Anyone who hires Milton for their DJ needs will not regret their choice.

If you’re looking for a DJ, look no further! We hired A Beautiful Sound for our November wedding in Reno and couldn’t be happier. I wanted a live music element for our ceremony, and Sam absolutely delivered. He was professional, responsive, kept the party going, and checked in with us throughout the night. We received so many compliments, and the dance floor was packed all evening. Highly recommend!

DJ Channa made our wedding the MOST fun! He was truly so amazing to work with. Besides being an amazing DJ, Channa is also just a genuinely nice person. When it rained on our wedding day, he rolled with the punches and encouraged us along the way. One of the things we were most excited about for our wedding was the dance floor and DJ Channa did not disappoint. There was not a single lul in the dancing and we even (unplanned) had 2 dance floors! We could not recommend DJ Channa more--he is the best!

From the first introductory call, Richard was a pleasure to work with ahead of the wedding and really got to know our styles. He seamlessly blended a couple niche inside-joke songs with crowd favorites, keeping the energy high the entire night. 6 months later and all our friends and family still talk about how it was the best dance floor they've ever experienced!

Leland was incredible to work with. He handled every detail flawlessly, from ceremony audio to the final song, and kept the dance floor packed all night. Leland honored our requests but also included music that matched how the crowd was feeling. I cannot thank Leland enough for making our day so smooth. Very experienced.

Greg was our DJ for our 50th Anniversary Party at Revere Golf Course. He set up all of the lights and the disco ball. We had a great selection of 70's music and everyone had a blast! He made sure to play the songs we requested and added some extra touches to make things even more special.
