We had our reception at the Westin Kierland Resort & Spa on May 6, 2023. Our experience was smooth sailing from start to finish! Christie Cline, the Senior Catering Sales Executive, was incredibly patient with my husband and I while we went back and forth on dates, menu selections, specific customizations, and changes in ballrooms. She was always prompt to respond and never made us feel like we were a burden when she was answering our many questions. Staci Stephenson, the Senior Event Manager, was an incredible help in the months leading up to the wedding and on the wedding day itself. She made sure to check on us personally on the wedding day, and was always cheerful and in good spirits when answering our questions. The rest of the staff were just as amazing and helpful, and I always felt like we were in good hands. On top of the amazing service, the venue itself is gorgeous. Our guests were raving about our cocktail hour space (which overlooked the lake and golf course), and they couldn't say enough nice things about the ballroom itself, as well as the food and drinks (which was provided by the Westin). I loved every bit of our big day, and I couldn't have asked for a better venue to host our wedding!

We had our wedding at Boojum Tree Hidden Gardens 3 weeks ago. It was the best decision we made. We chose the Birds of Paradise package. Outdoor ceremony, greenhouse for reception, and the party returned to their outdoor garden. (cigars okay!) Beautiful foliage, unique backdrops to photos, elegant, intimate setting, and fun for us and our guest. Our guest loved our wedding venue even in the 100 degree heat of the desert in September. Plenty of shade from the fully matured foliage. Jennifer was very caring, great with input, detail orientated, professional. Our package vendors were all very attentive and we sincerely thank them for their professionalism. (Heidi’s Event Catering, Valley Mix Entertainment Oscar, Raise Your Glass Bartending, Harley Bonham Photography, Jet Limousine) Relaxing atmosphere. We were from out of town, as were most of our guest, and Boojum Tree location was reasonable with travel time to and from lodging, airport, restaurants, and local attractions. 15 to 20 minutes tops.

I have to give the Hassayampa Inn, Amore, and her entire staff, a full five stars. They hosted our wedding recently and everything from the first meeting to the cleanup the next day was phenomenal service. Their rooftop location has the most stunning sunset views and was the perfect place for our 60 person wedding. Amore and her staff took care of EVERYTHING!! It was the most relaxing wedding day as they truly made me feel confident that they had every detail covered - and they did! Often wedding services feel like you are being taken advantage of, but the value of this venue is unmatched. I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention how delicious the dinner was! We chose the Hassayampa Favorite for our guests and everyone loved it. I highly recommend this venue for anyone looking for quality, care, and value in your wedding day.

I got married on 11.18.23 and I am so incredibly glad I picked the San Marcos for my venue! First of all the resort is absolutely gorgeous! Our guests commented several times about how beautiful the grounds were! I worked with two coordinators as there was a transition to a new coordinator during the planning of my event and I hope Yovany, the coordinator who is currently there stays with this property as she is absolutely wonderful! Due to the transition, Prince the banquet manager, stepped in as my go to contact the day of my event and he absolutely knocked it out of the park. I had the wedding of my dreams and the staff at the San Marcos were a huge part of making it all happen. I absolutely recommend the San Marcos for anyone looking for a wedding venue!

I’m so happy I chose the Ashley Castle as our venue! Half our guests were from the east coast and they said they thought everything was beautiful inside and outside. I appreciate the monthly food tastings they offer as well as all the meetings to help organize everything we dreamt of! I didn’t know venues can be all inclusive until I saw what The Ashley Castle offered. I LOVE that they have their own DJ, florist, catering, and venue coordinator! Everything about my April 12th wedding was perfect! I felt like a princess! Highly recommend this venue, especially for those who are coming from out of town: TONS of hotel options around the venue and a mall! 10000/10!!

There are not enough words to describe how grateful my husband and I are to have found not only Wedgewood Weddings but Stonebridge Manor as our wedding venue. From the very start to the very end we had the most incredible and stress-free experience. All of the vendors they provided were spectacular and gave us the most incredible experience. Gerardo, the wedding coordinator, was truly amazing, making our wedding day truly so special. Anything we needed or wanted, he made it happen. Matt, the DJ, was fantastic to work with and made our wedding day so memorable and fun. Tony, the officiant, ensured our vows were ones to remember for a lifetime. The food was incredible and Stonebridge Manor itself provided the most beautiful backdrop. Thank you, Stonebridge Manor, for giving us the wedding of our dreams.

Gainey Ranch Golf Club blew us away and exceeded our expectations. From the initial consultation to our wedding day, this venue went above and beyond. The indoor and outdoor spaces are just beautiful. The food and drinks were absolutely remarkable; our guests couldn't stop raving about the appetizers and the dinner. Their team is responsive, efficient, and were overall a pleasure to work with. They are truly amazing at what they do, and I am so glad we had our wedding here.

##  Finding Phoenix Wedding Venues 

Phoenix is quintessential North American dessert. It's hot, dry, and flat. While that may sound intimidating, don't let that deter you from searching for stunning wedding venues in beautiful western frontier. 

##  Popular Wedding Venues in Phoenix & Prices 

If you and your guests can bear the 100+ degree heat, an outdoor summer wedding venue may be a possible. But we suggest if you're getting married around June, July, or August, look for an indoor wedding venue with AC to keep your guests cool and comfortable. 

It may come as a surprise that even with Phoenix's record heat, most of the popular wedding locations are outdoors. Everything from manors, mansions, and villas to golf courses and country clubs are all well loved in Phoenix. If you're looking to experience the beauty of Phoenix without sweating out of your clothes, look to book a wedding venue between November and April. These days will have much more moderate temperatures, which is great for open air/ outdoor ceremony and reception venues. 

If you and your fiancé(e) aren't interested in going down the traditional wedding venue route, consider getting married at the Phoenix zoo or one of several museums. These are unique wedding locations that are sure to wow your guests. 

The average total wedding cost in Phoenix is $20,583, which is about $8,500 less than the national average. Don't worry if your budget is above or below these averages. Each wedding budget is different. 

##  Travel & Hotels 

There are two airports your out-of-town guests can use when flying in and out of Phoenix. The first is the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. If your wedding venue is in the center of the city, a drive or train ride from the airport should only take about 10 minutes. This is also a good choice if your wedding venue is near Tempe. 

If your wedding venue and hotel are closer to Gilbert or Mesa, the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport might be a better choice, though it only has domestic flights. If you have international guests coming to your wedding, Phoenix Sky Harbor International is probably the best way to fly without connecting flights. 

As far as hotels go, the average price for a night in Phoenix is around $117. If you're looking to accommodate a large number of guests in the same hotel, we suggest using this [wedding hotel block](https://hotelblocks.weddingwire.com "Wedding Hotel Block") service. Representatives will do all the hard work of finding hotels and comparing rates. All you have to do is choose which hotel is best for you and your guests. 

##  Weather Considerations 

Phoenix is definitely not one of those areas that have four seasons. In fact, it's hard to notice to the seasons changing unless you're there to feel the temperature. As a hot desert climate, Phoenix has long and extremely hot summers with short temperate winters. 

The warm (hot) season lasts from the end of May to the end of September with daily high temperatures averaging at about 98 degrees and the hottest days are likely to be in July. If you're looking to book your wedding venue for July, make sure guests have access to a covered area, out of the heat, and stay hydrated. Indoor wedding locations with air conditioning are probably best for the hot summer months. 

The cold (cool) season lasts from the end of November to the beginning of March with daily average temperatures around or below 73 degrees.This would be a great time to book an outdoor wedding location since you'll likely not have to consider inclement weather. Fun fact: sun shines in Phoenix 325 days a year, making it one of the sunniest places in the country! The only precipitation is likely to be experienced around the beginning of August. So just keep that in mind when looking at wedding venues. 

When you're ready to start your wedding venue search in Phoenix, WeddingWire has everything you'll need to make the process a breeze.
