## How much does a wedding cake cost?

Having a wedding cake at your reception is one of the biggest (and sweetest!) traditions. But what does a wedding cake cost? While wedding cake prices do vary depending on the size and style of your cake, the average cost of a wedding cake in the U.S. is around $500 with most couples spending between $300 to $700. While this may sound like a lot for a dessert, you’d be surprised as to how much work goes into creating a gorgeous wedding cake.

  * __ $ 94 or less Lower range
  * __ $ 540  Average cost
  * __ $ 362 - $ 700  Most couples spend between
  * __ $ 1,000 or more Upper range



Costs displayed are based on spend from thousands of couples who recently reported pricing for this service within their WeddingWire review. Pricing varies based on factors including, but not limited to, vendor’s experience, level of expertise, event guest count, date, and geographic region.

Which factors impact wedding cake prices?

__

Not surprisingly, the bigger and more elaborate a wedding cake is, the higher the cost of a wedding cake will be. A wedding cake featuring lots of design elements, including sugar flowers, fondant details, many tiers, and unique shapes, will cost more than a simpler cake with classic buttercream icing, a few fresh flowers, and fewer tiers. While your flavor choice likely won’t have an impact on your wedding cake’s price, requesting certain custom flavors may raise your wedding cake cost a bit. 

What is the starting price of a wedding cake?

__

The starting price of a wedding cake can vary depending on the type of frosting you prefer. Cakes covered in fondant, a sugary paste-like icing, tend to cost more than cakes covered in buttercream (frosting made from butter and sugar). Fondant is more durable than buttercream (and it [won’t melt in the summertime](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-expert-tips-to-avoid-a-summer-wedding-cake-meltdown)!), but it’s generally thought of as less tasty. The starting price of a fondant wedding cake is usually about $5 per slice, while the starting price of a buttercream wedding cake is about $4 per slice. Again, these wedding cake prices will vary even more based on decorations, size, etc. 

What’s included in the cost of a wedding cake?

__

This varies from cake baker to cake baker. Usually, the cost of your wedding cake will include the cake itself, a design consultation where your baker will create a custom design just for your wedding, [caketasting](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/everything-you-need-to-know-about-a-wedding-cake-tasting), delivery and set up. Some cake bakers will also include supplies like cake stands, [cake toppers](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/top-types-of-wedding-cake-toppers), and cutting utensils, though you may have to provide these on your own. And some wedding cake prices include an [extra top tier of your wedding cake](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-preserve-your-wedding-cake) or anniversary cake for you and your spouse to enjoy on your first anniversary. 

What types of desserts do wedding cake bakers offer?

__

About 54 percent of couples choose to serve an additional wedding dessert, aside from or in addition to wedding cake, at their receptions. Cake bakers may offer a variety of these alternative wedding desserts, including [cupcakes](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/15-reasons-why-we-still-love-cupcakes), cake pops, cookies, pies, pastries, doughnuts, and more—the starting price for cupcakes is about $3 per cupcake. There are also groom’s cakes, which are a tradition particularly in the South. We’ve seen these [groom’s cakes](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/cakes-desserts--t23) shaped like everything from sports paraphernalia to burritos! 

When should I hire a wedding cake baker?

__

We recommend hiring a wedding cake baker at least six months before your wedding day—these vendors do tend to book up quickly! Start by [reading online reviews of wedding cake bakers near you](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-cakes), and selecting a few to interview (in person whenever possible). You’ll typically have a wedding cake tasting after you’ve booked your baker, where you’ll [select your cake’s flavors](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/favorite-flavor-combinations-from-real-cake-bakers).

Everything about the cake was perfection. Except the way the vendor butchered it when slicing.

We used The Cakery for our wedding cake and our wedding favor cupcakes. We had a small wedding so we didn’t do anything extravagant but everything was awesome. The cake was delicious. We did three different flavors. The cupcakes looked so cute with their monograms and The Cakery even incorporated, our little dog statues into our cake for us. Their team was easy to work with. Communication was clear and concise. We would definitely recommend.

Everyone absolutely loved our wedding cake! They even have an event room at the bakery and that’s where my bridal shower was held. Lindsey was wonderful to work with during our tasting and design process. Our cake turned out just as we envisioned. We enjoy the cake so much that we came back two weeks post our wedding to pick up a cake for our sons birthday.

Jair Edwards of Simply Sweet Sensations made my daughter’s wedding vision come true. The bride wanted individual mini cakes for each guest. If you have ever tried to find these, only about 50% of bakeries will even consider it. As we tried cake after cake, they all seemed a little dry and a little bit lacking in taste. Until we tried Simply Sweet Sensations. We had actually put down a deposit with another well-known cake store but cancelled as soon as we tried Jair’s cakes. Jair personally brought out a sample pack of cake flavors for us to try and the were all so, so good. It was hard to narrow down to three. We ended up with Vanilla, Lemon and Chocolate. The cake is extraordinarily moist and the flavors! To die for. You need to try Simply Sweet Sensations to really believe how good this cake is. Jair spent a lot of time with me by email (we live in KC, wedding in STL) discussing how to top these mini cakes. The lemon and chocolate were easy but my daughter really wanted fresh figs for the white cake. Jair gave us some option in case figs were not available at the time of the wedding but at the last minute was able to obtain the last figs at the store. These individual cakes were beautiful. She also did a 6” cutting cake for the top of the tiered cake stand. Her pricing is very reasonable. We received so many compliments on the cake with many exclaiming that it was the best cake they had ever had. I couldn’t agree more. Jair Edwards of Simply Sweet Sensations LLC may not be as well known as she should be. I am here to tell you that if you are looking for wedding cake or any cake at all, you must try Simply Sweet Sensations. Jair may be one of St Louis’ best kept secret.

Yummmmmmm. I want more. Now. My husband and I always make each other ice cream cakes for our birthday, so when it was time to wedding plan we decided to research and see if ice cream wedding cake was something that actually existed. And what did we find? A local Cold Stone Creamery that does ice cream wedding cakes! YAY!!! Karen was great to work with. Professional, funny, patient. The cake was DELICIOUS. You basically get to go to the store and try the different cakes and cake components (frostings, fillings, etc) separately and then try different creations with toppings and mix-ins. Just like you would if you were just going to the store for ice cream, but in cake form. You can get whatever creation you want for your cake. Karen assured us that the cake would arrive solidly frozen and could sit out on display for an hour and a half. And she was totally right. She came on time and did the cake set-up without a hitch. When it was time to cut the cake, it was still beautiful and frozen perfectly. TIP: spend the money to have her cut the cake, or instruct your vendor to cut the pieces bigger than normal. We had lots of left overs because we didn't do that! Oh did I mention they decorate it to look just like a traditional wedding cake? You'd never guess there was ice cream in there just from looking at it. It was pretty! Because we had leftovers we were able to transport the extra cake six hours home, thanks to the polar vortex, safely in a box on top of our car. We ate cake for a week straight and didn't get sick of it. Our friends were asking to come over to help eat the leftovers. ITS GOOD. Our flavors: -yellow cake, raspberry layer, cheesecake ice cream with graham crackers mixed in -chocolate cake, peanut butter layer, chocolate ice cream with Reeses mixed in NOM NOM NOM
