Chelsea was awesome!

We hired Chelsea as our Day of Coordinator, and she was awesome throughout our whole wedding planning process! All of our calls over the year of planning went very smoothly. She always made me feel comfortable, confident, and assured that my vision would go off without a hitch. She provides an online planner which was super helpful and easy to use. Having all of the details in one place kept everything very organized. On the day of, Chelsea and her assistant Megan executed our vision perfectly. We had a really time consuming seating chart display and they crushed it, along with all of our other DIY items and cookie table setup! Throughout the night, they made sure we had appetizers ready at our table from cocktail hour, made sure we always had a drink in hand, and kept everything flowing and on schedule. I spilt my very first drink on my dress as soon as I sat down for dinner and Chelsea and Megan were there in two seconds with a Tide wet wipe that got the spot out perfectly! Overall, everything went smoothly from setup to tear down and we owe that to Chelsea and her team! She went above and beyond to make sure our day was perfect and we could not recommend her more!

Looking for a Top Tier Wedding planner? Look no more!

Hiring Chelsea was hands down the best decision we made for our wedding. We don’t live in Pittsburgh, and she truly became our eyes and ears throughout the entire planning process. From start to finish, she handled everything so smoothly that we honestly didn’t have to lift a finger on the wedding day.  
  
Our ceremony and dinner were exactly what we envisioned, and everything flowed perfectly. The transportation and transition between locations was incredibly seamless, so much so that guests kept commenting on how easy and organized everything felt. There was no confusion or downtime, just a smooth move from one part of the day to the next.  
  
Chelsea completely respected and honored our vision, while also being patient and flexible whenever we had questions or moments of uncertainty. She adapted as needed, guided us when we needed it, and made sure everything still felt like us. Her calm, steady presence made the entire experience stress-free.  
  
We feel so lucky that the memories of the best day of our lives include Chelsea. If you’re planning a wedding and want someone who is organized, thoughtful, and truly has your back, we can’t recommend her enough.

So thankful for Chelsea!

Chelsea coordinated our October wedding and I can't thank her enough. She was so organized and helped ensure our entire day went smoothly. She thought of every little detail and made sure everything was planned ahead of time and taken care of on the day. It was such a relief knowing I had Chelsea to help. Her spreadsheets/planning tools were extremely helpful to keep things organized and make sure nothing was forgotten. She was so sweet and easy to work with- I really enjoyed my time with her- especially the month prior to my wedding when we were in contact often. I miss working with her! We are so, so thankful for Chelsea and so happy she made our day come together so perfectly. Would definitely recommend her to anyone!

Beloved Event Co.

My wife and I hired Chelsea as our day-of coordinator for our wedding in October 2025. While we managed most of the initial planning ourselves—such as booking vendors and creating the guest list—we knew we needed help finalizing details and someone to manage the day itself. After our initial meeting, we were confident Chelsea was the perfect fit for our wedding. Her attention to detail was apparent and her planning documents were exceptionally clear, thorough, and easy to follow.  
  
In the months leading up to the wedding, Chelsea worked closely with us to refine our vision and ensure every detail aligned perfectly with what we had imagined. She lifted a huge weight off our shoulders by coordinating seamlessly with all of our vendors and resolving any issues or uncertainties. On the wedding day, Chelsea executed everything flawlessly—the décor was impeccable, the timeline flowed seamlessly, and we were able to fully enjoy every moment without concern for logistics. Her professionalism, calm presence, and meticulous attention to detail made our wedding truly unforgettable. We wholeheartedly recommend Chelsea and Beloved Event Co. to anyone seeking an exceptional coordinator.

Wedding Coordinator You Need! 

I truly don't know what I would have done without Chelsea and her assistant Abbey on the day of our wedding. We initially sought out a wedding coordinator as a requirement from our vendor, very naively wondering if it was truly "necessary". I stand very firmly in saying having Chelsea and her team with us was one of the best decisions we made. Chelsea was able to provide us with templates which I found very helpful in organizing our vision, guest list, vendors, building out our timeline, helping us when we had quite the twist and turns of wedding planning leading up the big day. Which as a DIY bride who loves a spreadsheet it was fantastic. Day of she handled EVERYTHING! Setting up tables, handling vendors arriving and leaving, managed lighting our candles, kept my husband and I well hydrated when new never left the dance floor are just some of the things she had on her plate. When I tell you I didn't have to look at my phone or answer a billion questions it is because Chelsea knew our vision and made it happen. We also added on cookie table setup, and our guest were blown away. ( I earned yinzer status, from my native Pittsburgh friends and family and badge I wear with honor.)   
  
You will not regret having Chelsea on your team!

Chelsea made our wedding day perfect!!

Chelsea was our wedding coordinator, and she went above and beyond every step of the way. We were able to truly enjoy the day knowing that Chelsea was there to handle any issues that might arise throughout the day, and because of her attention to detail, ability to anticipate our needs and the vendors’ needs, we were able to be fully present throughout our entire day. Despite getting stuck in an elevator, she remained calm and professional throughout the day, and resolved multiple issues without us ever being alerted to an issue. Without her, our day would have felt much more chaotic. She worked seamlessly with our vendors, and her top priority every step of the way was for us to have the perfect wedding day. I truly can not recommend Chelsea enough to anyone and am so thankful for the opportunity to have her be a part of our special day. Because of how lovely she is to work with, even after the wedding we would love to be friends with her outside of any wedding planning.

Wedding Review

Chelsea is beyond amazing. Our wedding was a dream come true, and we couldn’t have done it without her. She was our day-of coordinator but went above and beyond and was much more! She was extremely helpful throughout and provided us with tools and resources to help us through the wedding planning process. About six months out, she assisted us with our timeline and details of our wedding day. She even attended our final walkthrough, which was super helpful. Our wedding day couldn’t have run more smoothly, thanks to Chelsea.  
  
If you’re looking for someone who truly cares, communicates effectively, and brings both professionalism and heart to your day, look no further. Her organization, attention to detail, and dedication were outstanding. We were able to fully enjoy our day knowing everything was in the best hands. Chelsea worked seamlessly with all our vendors and made our vision come to life. We can’t thank her enough for everything!

Day of Coordinator 

Chelsea is truly incredible. My husband & I used her for our May 2025 wedding, and we could not be happier with her service. Chelsea's the sweetest, most organized, and most helpful person and she truly made our wedding vision come to life. From the very beginning, Chelsea always made time for us and always answered our emails very quickly. Anytime we had a question, or an issue came up she quickly took action to ensure everything was taken care of. She kept us organized and on top of things and our wedding went seamless because of her/ her team. We got so many compliments as to how well organized our wedding was and we owe that all to Chelsea. Cannot recommend her enough if you are in the area!

Must Hire!

Not sure where to start, but Chelsea, the heart and soul of Beloved Event Co is the exact person you want for your wedding. My wife and I got married on 11.09.2024 and hired Chelsea/Beloved Event Co as our day of planner earlier this year. She was on the ball with us from the jump. Leading up to the day of, she was in contact with all of our vendors to make sure they had all of the information they needed to operate smoothly on the day of. She mapped out the entire night down to the smallest detail to be exactly how we wanted. She asked planning questions for things I don’t think we ever would’ve thought about that had such a big impact on the night. She has top notch organization with shared google docs and spreadsheets that we were able to update as we went and helped keep her in the loop as well.  
  
On the day of the wedding, she was a godsend. She helped keep us on schedule without being overbearing or pushy. If we felt like we wanted more time for something like walking around to tables to thank our guests, she gave us a “no problem” and let the DJ know to give us more time before the first dance. When we then took a little too long, she gently offered some professional advice as to why we may need to move on from it. Her experience and expertise are very apparent and we were happy to go with her advice.   
  
Perhaps the best thing we can say about Chelsea is above her top notch organizational skills and attention to detail was her obvious care for the Bride and Groom. I don’t think we ever had to go looking for Chelsea at all that night. She was never in our faces or pushing us but I swear she was always near when we needed her. It meant so much to us to have someone so knowledgeable and attentive. She wanted to make sure we had the best night of our lives and, thanks in HUGE part to Chelsea, we did.   
  
Thank you for helping to make our night one we will never forget.  
  
Melissa and Tyler
