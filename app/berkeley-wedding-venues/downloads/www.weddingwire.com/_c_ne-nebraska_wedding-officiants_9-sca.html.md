Lauren was great! She was very easy to work with and professional. She was able to provide a lot of resources and ideas for what we might want to include in the ceremony, which was great considering we had no idea where to start, and she was able to make it as special to us as possible. She was flexible with the ceremony script and was open to any and all feedback. We were also so grateful that she took care of our marriage license, so it was one less thing to worry about. We would recommend her to anyone looking for an officiant!

My wife and I were kind of dreading the planning that would need to be done for our ceremony, but Linda made it so easy. She provided everything we needed to make the ceremony our own and was very responsive when we had any questions. The ceremony was all we could have hoped for and we were very glad to have found her.

Greg was an absolutely fantastic officiant. He helped us figure out how we wanted our ceremony to sound. It was simple and painless. At the ceremony, he was always available and willing to help. He made sure we got time to ourselves and the day was centered around us. He made our day even better than I could have imagined. He was the best person we could have gotten for us.

Our officiant was Rev. Tom with Beyond Illusions. He did a great job at offering his services at a decent price that included our consultation. We are not a religious couple, so it was important for us to find someone that wouldn't make us do the counseling and try to push their religious views onto us. Rev. Tom did a great job at providing us with multiple examples of poems and script for our ceremony so that we could make it our own, instead of him creating it for us. We were involved with all of the decision making and were able to write our own vows. He also offered his services at the rehearsal for an additional $50. Our officiant did a great job at rolling with the punches at our wedding. Somehow the dummy rings with the ring bearer were given to the Best Man and the real rings were left in the area where everyone got ready that morning. He did a great job and not making it obvious and moving onto the next portion of the ceremony. I was impressed with his services and would recommend him to others.
