The Club at Castlewood - the venue is absolutely perfect. It is a beautiful place to get married. The palm trees that line the entrance is such a show-stopper. Sandy and her team were so receptive and responsive to everything my husband and I wanted. I used an outside caterer as my husband and I wanted family-style Asian cuisine so I cannot speak to the food here. I had a guest count of a bit less than 200. Pros: \- Multiple locations for guests to hang out and mingle that wasn’t the reception hall (outside patio, indoor bar area with couches, lobby area with more couches) \- Bar area was huge and quick to serve my guests. Many guests told me the bartenders that worked at our wedding were some of the best ones they’ve seen. We upgraded the bar package at the last minute, and it was worth it to us. \- The men and women’s locker room has a cute area to get ready in, chairs, couches, lounge chairs, make up stations (and showers)! They also have a lot of amenities including razors, combs, hairspray, deodorant, etc. \- Service was awesome. They refilled waters, bussed tables, all of the above. \- Allowed us to leave our decor there the day prior so we wouldn’t have to do it the day-of (even though there was an event the night before!) It was about 4 large totes, 6 smaller ones, and a few easels. \- We had asked for a golf cart to wheel some older guests back up to the reception area after the ceremony. They almost forgot this until my coordinator asked the banquet manager. Thankfully they were able to do it for us in the end. Cons: \- Outside caterer has to cook outside which is one level below the reception hall. This is particularly difficult without an elevator to help get to the reception area, especially since we were doing family-style and not buffet, which means plates for each and every table. We were able to come to an agreement on how to make it work, but it was a bit challenging on all parts. \- There’s no dedicated bridal suite so my things were out in the open for the club members to see and possibly take. On the day of, it didn’t matter too much as nothing went missing, but it was stressful thinking about it leading up to the event. I also felt bad I basically took over the whole area away from the club members. It would be helpful to have our own space to change. \- That being said, there isn’t a designated groom suite either. He had to leave his clothes in the women’s locker room after changing. We knew about the cons before booking with Castlewood, but due to how beautiful it was and that they could hold my guest count indoors in a reception room, we went with them anyway, but I still wanted to point those out to future brides and grooms.

My fiance and I were married last month at Casa and it was amazing! Virginia and Kara, and all of the staff were amazing since the moment we first went to tour the venue about 8 months before our big date. They were all so extremely professional, kind, responsive and very helpful in our planning throughout. Casa offers everything included, or you can further personalize. We chose to use everything that is provided (white linens, chairs, china, etc). We were not disappointed. Everything looked so elegant. And the food - the food was amazing. All of our guests raved about how delicious the food was (we offered our guests a choice of chicken gruyere as well as the filet mignon). They also accommodated several people with multiple allergies (we were told by the guests that the chef came out and directly spoke with them to walk through the ingredients). This and other personal touches throughout the night helped make our night so memorable. It is a beautiful venue with lots of options! I was very concerned at first on how such a large space could accommodate my relatively small wedding of 93 people. But it worked perfect! We chose to have an ivory curtain that blocked off the cocktail hour inside, but it would have been fine without. The vineyards were perfect for sunset photos. We really can't say enough good things about this place. We highly recommend having your wedding here especially if (like us) you want/need the extra help in planning your day. They treated us wonderfully. We loved how we were able to enjoy cocktail hour while taking photos. There were two servers that accompanied us during pictures with a cart food of food and drinks - such an awesome touch! Having a day- of coordinator was another great part of Casa's wedding package. We loved how we were just able to show up and enjoy our wedding! The staff made it about as stress free as a wedding could possibly be. Our wedding was on a Thursday evening which offers a discounted rate - it was a fantastic value for what we got. We highly recommend Casa!

We recently celebrated our wedding at Callippe. Morgan and her team were very welcoming from our first tour at the golf course with horrible weather, to our food tasting, final decisions, rehearsal and of course our wedding day. The food was amazing. The atmosphere was beautiful especially ending the night with the party under the beautiful string lights. We couldn't ask for a more perfect wedding night

The Food Industry Sales Association (FISA) is delighted to provide a review of our recent Holiday Luncheon at Ruby Hill. The entire experience was exceptional. The venue was amazing, providing a stunning backdrop for our event. The food was good, but the service truly elevated the day. The wait staff was outstanding—professional, attentive, and efficient. We must also commend Kymberlie and Samantha on the planning committee; their customer service was fantastic. They ensured every detail was handled, making the planning process seamless. We highly recommend Ruby Hill for any organization seeking a beautiful location and excellent service for their next event.
