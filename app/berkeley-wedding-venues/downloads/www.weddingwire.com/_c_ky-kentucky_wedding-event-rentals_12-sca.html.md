"Went to our first silent disco last Fall and it was seriously the coolest experience ever! I brought a few friends with me for their first experience too! Half the night we were on different channels but we continued to vibe all through the night. Whether the channels were the same or not. Walking over to get food and nobody has headphones on in that area but I did...I felt like the life of the party bc I kept on dancing and nobody had a clue what I was listening to. But you could tell they were interested! If you haven't been to one yet 10/10 recommend!!" I've been to a handful more of these events and everytime it's so much fun! Our school hosted an event for graduation and seeing that many people in one space all connecting and dancing the night away was pure magic!

Rustic and More provided phenomenal value and service. They offered a virtual consultation, were able to match our wedding colors easily, and had a variety of extra rental options that helped add character and atmosphere to our ceremony. Pick-up and drop-off of our rentals was both easy and simple. We had bad weather the week before our wedding (in January), which caused some sourcing issues for our Chiffon runners, but they were able to help us quickly resolve the issue. A family company that treats you like family.

You don't need an appointment, just drop by. We used them for linens and napkins. They had a wide variety of styles and colors. We were able to find exactly what we wanted and they had enough variety to match the 5 colors of the Ladies in Waiting's dresses (peacock colors). Tracy took great care of us!

My husband really liked the invitations that they where making.We ended up buying two varieties and we loved how they turned out.We ended up buying ribbons and other things from our local craft store to customize them.I'm glad we ended up buying them.

I had a lot of trouble finding decorations for my wedding. We were down to a week, and my mother went in and told me what they had. I picked out the same things as I had wanted at another store and it costed me $600 less!!!

I cannot stress this enough...Laura saved my wedding. Seriously. We had a mix up with the venue who called Reliable wanted to change my rentals. Laura knew me well enough to call me immediately. Had she not, I would have not known my venue coordinator was out and the venue had none of her notes. Reliable is so in tune with their clients. On top of that, all my linens looked wonderful, many of which were their personal recommendations. I will refer them to everyone!

Our wedding planner recommended Purdon's and they were awesome and definitely reasonably priced! She did much of the coordination, but they were super flexible, especially after we had to postpone our wedding a year due to the pandemic. Their team was so sweet every time I would call and everything looked beautiful on our wedding day! Can't thank them enough :)
