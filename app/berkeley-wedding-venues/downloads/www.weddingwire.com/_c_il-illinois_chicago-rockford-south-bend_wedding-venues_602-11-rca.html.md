Obviously, the ballroom is GORGEOUS. I guarantee you will not find a single venue as classy, artistic, memorable, historic, and just beautiful anywhere else in the Chicagoland area, ESPECIALLY not for such a great price! The food was also some of the most delicious banquet food I've ever had! Staff was all excellent, from the wait staff and chef, to Karen the coordinator for rooms and other things you might need, to the security guards even. But of course our wedding coordinator, Ruthie, was the highlight of the show. She answered calls and texts at every hour of every day and made sure that we were taken care of always! Ruthie went above and beyond so many times--from finding little decorations to help make our day look even nicer, to coordinating with all the staff and making sure every little request was granted. She acted as our day-of coordinator, too, staying until the early hours of the morning to make sure we were 1000% taken care of, even though I'm sure that is NOT in her job description! Thank you, Ruthie for everything you've done to make our day so special! And thank you to the entire Congress Plaza staff for a drop-dead gorgeous wedding venue and friendly, helpful attitudes that made our wedding one that I'm sure nobody will stop talking about for years!

Five stars is not high enough for The Drake Hotel Chicago! Every aspect of my daughter’s wedding planning and celebration was truly extraordinary. Within minutes of meeting our main contact, Sydney Waclawik, we knew we were in the best hands. From the first planning meeting to the final moments of the wedding day, Sydney was a steady, knowledgeable, and reassuring presence. Her professionalism, organization, and attention to detail were unmatched. Her fabulous support team of Sonya Ward and Shalinee Abraham assisted in seeing that all of our needs were met and executed flawlessly. Sydney and her team truly listened to my daughter’s vision and brought it to life with care and precision. They worked seamlessly with our vendors, ensuring everything went smoothly. Sharon Johnson, the Director of Reservations, made the guest room block process effortless, with prompt responses, clear communication, and kindness. The historic French Room set a stunning stage for the cocktail hour, and the timeless beauty of The Gold Coast Room wowed our guests as the reception venue. Unique traditions like The Drake’s renowned Bookbinders soup and the celebratory champagne parade added memorable wow factors that our guests are still talking about. The cuisine was extraordinary—every dish was delicious, artfully presented, and served with impeccable care. Under the direction of Georges, the Director of Banquets who oversaw the setup, the Banquet Captains Jorge and Lino delivered a dining experience that exceeded all expectations, making every guest feel celebrated. The guest rooms were spacious, immaculate, and luxurious. Floyd, the bellhop, was always on hand with a friendly smile and efficient service, further enhancing our experience. From start to finish, the entire team at The Drake Hotel was impeccable. We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue or team to host this special occasion. Thank you for making our daughter’s wedding a dream come true!

My husband and I had our wedding at The Woman’s Club of Evanston in October 2025, and we truly cannot recommend this venue enough. The space is gorgeous on its own — not a blank slate at all — so we didn’t need nearly as many decorations or flowers as we did at other venues we considered. Our guests raved all day about how beautiful and unique the building was. One of the biggest advantages is that the entire venue is yours for the day. There are no other weddings or events happening at the same time, which makes everything feel calm, special, and centered on your celebration. We had a Sunday brunch wedding, held our ceremony downstairs (very cozy and intimate), and our reception upstairs in the ballroom. The flow between spaces was seamless, and the ballroom floor is amazing for dancing. The sound system was excellent — speeches and music were crystal clear. Gretchen was wonderful to work with throughout the planning process. She provided vendor recommendations, kept us on track to meet deadlines, and answered all of our questions. We used J&L Catering for our food and Schaffer’s for alcohol, and both were excellent and the liquor from Schaffer’s was a significant cost savings. Another huge bonus: so many essentials are included with the rental, such as tables, chairs, silverware, and plates. At other venues, those items can be surprisingly expensive to source. Logistically, this location is hard to beat. There are several hotels and great restaurants within walking distance, making it incredibly easy for our out-of-town guests to enjoy an entire weekend in Evanston. Our local guests appreciated that parking is free in Evanston on Sundays and close to the venue. There are also plenty of bathrooms on the same floors where all the events take place — a small detail that makes a big difference for guest comfort. Finally, it felt meaningful to support a historic building and philanthropic organization rather than a large hotel chain. Overall, we highly recommend The Woman’s Club of Evanston as a premier wedding venue in the greater Chicagoland area. We couldn’t imagine having celebrated anywhere else.

Long overdue review! My husband and I got married here in August and it was everything we dreamed of and more. Kendall K. was our assigned manager and holy moley she is the best! She truly helped us create the wedding of our dreams. Together we curated an amazing unique dinner, dessert, and drink menu for our guests which they LOVED. Throughout 2 years of planning, Kendall was there to answer any question we had and was always offering suggestions to enhance our wedding day! She was there on the day of and helped make sure everything ran smoothly. We couldn’t have done it without her. It was seamless and perfect. She went above and beyond for us. I can’t say enough good things about Kendall! The food was seriously amazing. The best food we’ve ever had at a wedding. We got tons of compliments on the iconic locations, the food, and the drinks! Seriously all top notch. We couldn’t be happier and loved our wedding day at River Roast. HIGHLY recommend!

We loved working with Galleria Marchetti. Danielle was lovely to work with and very flexible and accommodating. We really wanted to not deal with a caterer as well as a venue so Galleria did it all in one. Their food was great and most importantly all 200 guests were served warm food in about 10 minutes. Everything went according to plan and the courtyard was gorgeous in August. We highly recommend!

Salvatore’s was an exceptional wedding venue. Marco, Brandon, Cameron, and the rest of the staff were helpful and communicative from planning our tour to making last-minute changes the week before our wedding. We chose the Sunday microwedding package, which was perfect for the size of wedding we wanted to have. The venue itself is gorgeous and is already well-decorated. The patio was perfect for our ceremony, the lobby was a gorgeous entrance for our guests, and the bar and dining room had the perfect ambience. The food was delicious; we chose the rigatoni bolognese, chicken Vesuvio, and tortellini casalinga – all were fantastic. We were also impressed by the wait staff, all of whom were exceptionally kind and helpful throughout the evening. We would absolutely recommend Salvatore’s to other couples planning their weddings.

From the moment we stepped into Pazzos, we were truly wowed. We didn’t feel the need to tour any other venues—this was a one-and-done decision for us. Not only is the space absolutely stunning, but its location in the heart of downtown, right next to the Sears Tower, made it even more special. Rali, the coordinator, was such a pleasure to work with. She listened to every request and ensured the entire day flowed seamlessly. The owner, Jaxer, was also incredible—so warm, welcoming, and genuinely invested in making our experience unforgettable. We couldn’t have chosen a venue with better food, a better atmosphere, or better people. The entire staff was fantastic, and we loved every single minute of our celebration at Pazzos. Highly recommend.

##  Booking Your Chicago Wedding Venue 

It's hard to think of Chicago as anything but a bustling metropolis, but its location in the mid-west lends itself to some drastically different wedding locations. From modern and chic wedding venues in the heart of the city, to more cozy and rustic ceremony and receptions venues in the surrounding areas, Chicago is sure to please every type of engaged couple. 

##  Popular Wedding Venues in Chicago & Prices 

Chicago has wedding venues for everyone. Before looking for a wedding venue, you and your fiancé(e) should decide on the time of year you want to get married as well as a few ideas about theme. Not every wedding has a concrete theme like nautical or 1920s inspired, but it's good to come up with a few ideas. This will likely help you find the best ceremony and reception venue for your special day. The most popular wedding venues in Chicago include: hotels, restaurants, country clubs, and mansions/manor houses. 

If you and your fiancé(e) have a more modern wedding style in mind, a hotel or country club would be an excellent fit. Their reception spaces can be molded to fit any wedding theme because they're used for a number of different events. Hotels are a wonderful option for weddings with a large number of out-of-town guests. Weddings guests won't need to travel far to the wedding venue, they'll only need to go down a few floors. Country Clubs, as well as some hotels, also have the option for outdoor or open-air wedding locations while also having backup spaces in the case of inclement weather. 

Maybe your wedding tastes, as a couple, are a little more historic. Mansions, chateaux, and manor houses are beautiful wedding venues that offer a variety of spaces for the perfect wedding experience. Not only will they wow your guests, these historic locations are sure to make a beautiful backdrop in all your wedding photos! 

If you're looking for a wedding venue that's a little more out of the box, consider a library or university building. 

As for pricing, the average price of a wedding in Chicago is about $37,153, which is $8,000 above the national average. If you're wedding budget look exactly like the averages, don't fret. Every couple decides on unique budget when planning their big day. 

##  Travel & Hotel Accommodations 

It's to be expected that not every person you're inviting to your wedding will live nearby. Those out-of-town wedding guests will need to make travel and hotel accommodations for their trip. For guests that are flying in, Chicago has major airports. Midway and O'Hare. Chicago Midway International Airport is about a 20 minute drive or 15 minute train ride to the wedding venues that are in the heart of the city. If your wedding venue is near Cicero or Oak Park, this is definitely the best option for your guests. O'Hare Airport is about a 35 minute drive or 50 minute train ride to venues in the city. However, if you're wedding venue is closer to Des Plaines or Wheaton, guests should consider flying through O'Hare. 

For hotel accommodations, a night in Chicago is about $152/ night. Though if you're looking to get a number of rooms in a hotel close to your venue, we suggest using this [wedding hotel block](https://hotelblocks.weddingwire.com "Wedding Hotel Block") service. Representatives will do all the hard work of finding the best rates for rooms. All you have to do is decide on the hotel or hotels and send the booking information to your guests. 

##  Weather Considerations 

While Chicago's nickname is the "windy city", the city itself is not known for extreme wind. In fact, the name came from how much the residents of Chicago would talk about their beloved city. Chicago's climate is actually humid continental with warm summers and cold winters. 

The warm season in Chicago lasts from the end of May to the middle of September, with average daily high temperatures above 73 degrees. And the hottest days should be expected in the middle of July. If you're booking an outdoor or open air wedding venue in the summer, make sure guests can stay cool and hydrated. Offer drinks are your ceremony or perhaps give fans as wedding favors. You should also take in consideration the chance of summer thunderstorms. Even though it is least likely to rain in August, you should always have a backup venue space arranged with your wedding venue. 

The cold season lasts from the end of November to the beginning of March, with the coldest days being around the middle of January. The average daily high temperatures tend to be below 41 degrees and the highest chance of some form of precipitation is usually around the end of December. If you're planning on booking a wedding venue during the winter months, go with something indoors. If you want to take pictures with the wedding party outside the venue, consider adding a little glam with faux fur stoles and long coats. This will keep everyone warm through the photo session. Snow is also a possibility in Chicago, so find out if your wedding location has policies for inclement weather and consider getting wedding insurance just in case. 

For spring and fall weddings, patio heaters are a great way to keep guests warm without looking like an eyesore. Guests will surely appreciate you thinking about their comfort. 

When you're ready to start your Chicago wedding venue search, WeddingWire has everything you need to compare wedding locations in Chicago and the surrounding areas.
