The [dress code](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/the-ultimate-guide-to-wedding-dress-codes) is an important guideline, but following it shouldn't stop you from wearing something that emanates your individual style.

### 13\. Elegant wedding guest dress

Finding the perfect dress for a summer wedding can be tricky, especially if your preferred style is a little more conservative.

Being mindful of the materials you choose is another way to ensure the sun doesn't melt your good mood. This light maxi is made from cool satin and boasts beautiful design features, including balloon sleeves, an empire waist and a button-down front. Pick up this formal summer wedding guest dress (with sleeves!) in plus sizes 14 to 24.
