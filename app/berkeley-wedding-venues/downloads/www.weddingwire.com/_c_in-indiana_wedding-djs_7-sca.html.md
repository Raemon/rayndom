Alomar and our DJ Marc did an excellent job of making our wedding reception a great time. Marc took the time to meet with us beforehand to get an idea of the kind of music we liked and didn't like, and he delivered by playing music that we wanted to hear and also made people dance. The dance floor was full the entire time, and it was exactly what we hoped for.

Steve did an amazing job. Had great input to help us tweak a few things and they all went fantastic. Our day wouldn't have been as special without the help of Steve. You will not regret hiring him!

Andrew was our DJ for a Notre Dame graduation party for about 150 people. He was amazing! He definitely brought the fun to the party, and it would not have been the same without his great energy, timing, DJ skills, song choices and overall positive contribution. He perfectly announced different speakers and activities throughout the evening. The guests had a phenomenal time dancing to his awesome musical choices (including upbeat but quieter dinner music when the dinner was being eaten). His photo booth was a huge hit, and the attendant was helpful and patient. Andrew even custom-designed a photo page template for the photos. He was organized and communicative leading up to the party, and he perfectly executed every stage of the evening. We would choose DJSouthBend again for any party!

Tim was fantastic! I think a DJ can make or break a wedding, and Tim definitely MADE ours. He was amazing to work with. I loved how he had a portal for the wedding to go into and select songs and organize our timeline. Our wedding flowed perfectly because of Tim! He was easy to work with and communicated flawlessly. Our guest were able to request songs which was so much fun! His equipment,microphones, and lighting were top notch. His set up was beautiful and looked very professional. A few songs I selected DJ Choice, and his music flowed with everything else we had selected. I highly recommend Tim/ Circle City Sound!!

This man is awesome! He went above and beyond for my daughter’s wedding. From start to finish was absolutely amazing, did not miss a beat. And to top it all off, he surprised them with the most beautiful video recording of their wedding. I highly recommend him! Thank you Frank Smith III for making my daughter and son-in-law’s day extra special!

Greg did an amazing job and everyone was telling me how much fun our DJ was! He even thought of stuff to ask us that our venue coordinator didn’t even think to talk with us about. 100 out 10 would recommend!!!

Anthony was amazing. His process helped us plan our big day as well as communicate everything we needed from him. I was able to make last second adjustment on the fly with ease. He had amazing presence and attitude through the entire reception to keep things flowing smoothly. I couldn't be happier working with him to make our big day a reality.

From the very first phone call, our experience was exceptional! We worked with owner, Brian, to set up the details and then stayed in close communication with DJ Matt before our wedding!! Matt caught the vibe instantly, played every song we wanted to hear, and kept the timeline moving throughout the night. Awesome experience, book this DJ!

We are so happy we went with The Simple DJ for our wedding! Dennis was wonderful! We didn’t have an empty dance floor the entire night! They provided excellent music, read the vibe of the dance floor, and gave us the opportunity to have all of the special dances we requested! They were so easy to work with and communication was quick whenever we had questions! We couldn’t have asked for better people to share our day with!
