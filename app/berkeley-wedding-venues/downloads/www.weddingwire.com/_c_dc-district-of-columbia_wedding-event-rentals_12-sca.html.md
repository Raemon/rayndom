I recently rented a fog machine for my children's end-of-summer party, and it was an absolute hit! The fog created the perfect fun and exciting atmosphere, making the party feel like a real event. The kids loved running through the mist, and it added an extra cool effect to our lights and music. The machine worked flawlessly, producing a steady and consistent fog without any issues. It was easy to set up, and the quality was top-notch. The customer service was also excellent—friendly, responsive, and very helpful in choosing the right machine for our event. If you're looking for a fog machine to take your party to the next level, I highly recommend this business. Great product, great service, and an unforgettable experience for everyone!

I booked Kathy Johnson as my Wedding Coordinator and she went above and beyond. She made all of my wishes come true and respected the vision I had for my wedding. I got married just 7 months after becoming engaged and the timeline didn’t worry her at all. She made me feel confident that everything could be accomplished, and it was! I couldn’t have done this without her and highly recommend her services.

Review by Wedding Planner: Tim and his team (Pete, Brian, and Milton) all deserve 5 stars! We contracted Brooke Rental Center for a 60'x30' tent attached to a second 30'x30' tent for an outdoor ceremony and reception/dinner and could not be happier. Tim came out for a site-visit to evaluate the property for Plan A and Plan B locations and fully understood that we had to wait until the last possible day to decide which Plan to go with. Throughout the planning process Tim was accessible by telephone and email. No matter how many phone calls he received from me, he was always very courteous and patient. His suggested tent size was just right as we utilized every square foot we had available. Tent set-up took place the Wednesday before the Saturday wedding to ensure there was enough time in case we ran into any hiccups. The crew needed little instruction as they worked efficiently as they could. Day 2 included installation of the side walls and heaters. I was able to add 3 chandeliers at the last minute as I suspected it would be too dim in the tent on a cloudy day. Tim was able to fit that in at the last minute without hesitation. To ensure no leaks would happen, they sprayed the tops of the tent with water and patched up any spots on-site. The day of the wedding I ran into an emergency with the heater and Tim was able to send out a tech to not only assess but replace immediately. I fully understand that hiccups happen unexpectedly and I appreciate Tim's efforts in resolving it ASAP. Throughout the planning process Tim assured that his team would stay as long as needed to make sure the job was done and they did just that. We received MANY compliments on the tent and lighting provided by Brooke Rental Center. Please ask for Tim for your event-- he is great

This company went above and beyond for my wedding! There was a fan that was loud and the workers noticed it, came fixed it the next day! I was so happy with the whole process and the employees were great! Totally worth it for any big events.

Something Vintage made linen rentals smooth and fun for our wedding. The wishlist function on the website allows for easy and clear order creation and invoicing. We also got a linen “tasting” so we could look at our selections at home before committing to the order. So handy! We are local and weren’t getting any large pieces, so we chose the pick-up option and the staff at the warehouse were quick and helpful. The linens were clean, and came flat-packed a pre-pressed for easy setup. Not only are Something Vintage’s linens beautiful, unique, and high quality, but their customer service is top-notch. We had a bit of a scare regarding the color and number of linens we picked up and they got right on fixing the issue and making us feel at ease. They might just say this to all the couples, but the event coordinator at our venue said the place settings were some of the best she’d ever worked with. Much credit goes to Something Vintage for their excellent inventory and their commitment to customer service. Highly recommended for weddings and events in the DMV that are looking for a splash of color! Photos courtesy of https://vnessphotography.com/
