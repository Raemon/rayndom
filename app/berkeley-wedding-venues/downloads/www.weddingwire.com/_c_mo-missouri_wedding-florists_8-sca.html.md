I could not recommend Jenna enough. She brought to life my dream wedding florals from my bouquet to the ceremony. Everything was elegant and beautifully made. Although we were miles away, her communication was great and she ensured everything was confirmed and exactly how I wanted it before our big day. I loved my wedding bouquet so much that it is now framed in our home for everyone to enjoy!

Good Earth Floral was wonderful to work with for my wedding this May! Jessica helped bring my vision to life while also being realistic with what was possible in my budget. Everything turned out better than I expected, the florals were beautifully done and really helped elevate the venue. All of my guests could not stop commenting on them! Jessica's customer service and responsiveness made the planning process easy as well. I would highly recommend for any bride in the KC area!

I can not say enough good things about Diana and her team. She is the easiest person to get along with, she wants to make sure you get your perfect vision on your special day. She is so experienced and so amazing in her craft. Everyone raved about how beautiful the florals were, one of my guests is getting married and asked for her contact information because she was so impressed and had to have her do her wedding as well. You would think of how amazing and beautiful everything was, it would be incredibly expensive, but Diana is extremely reasonable in her prices. We are so so so glad we found her and trusted her with our special day.

One of the main reasons we booked Les Bouquets was because in our initial consultation, Elisabeth seemed genuinely excited about our ideas and vision. We are SO glad we chose her—she did an amazing job! I absolutely loved my bouquet and got SO many compliments on it. Elisabeth was lovely to work with, answering my many questions and edits. We highly recommend!

Stem Florist made our entire wedding day absolutely beautiful. Kim went above and beyond to help us with our wedding day throughout our entire engagement while being mindful of our budget. She was flexible with meeting with us as many times as we needed and during off-hours since we were traveling from out of town. Every time we met she would happily re-explain things and make any changes we thought of (which ended up being a lot)! When we did not know how to make a decision, she walked us through all the options and laid/drew everything out for us. Her background as an architect helped us set up our reception ballroom symmetrically & beautifully with the layout of Four Seasons. She also helped us with things outside floral decor such as table settings, aisle runners, candles, and linens. Kim corresponded with other vendors and our wedding coordinator without our prompt as well. She truly knew every family member and corresponded with my parents as well as my husband and I. On the wedding day Kim made our vision come to life beautifully. The ceremony and reception looked better than we could have ever dreamed. She also found all members of the wedding party without any need of direction and gave them bouquets, boutonnieres, and corsages. Kim went above and beyond in every way. We can not thank Stem Florist enough for everything they did to make our wedding vision come true!

We work for Fletcher’s flowers for my bridal bouquet, flower girl, crowns, petals, grooms square flower pocket and boutonnieres. Not only were they reasonably priced, but the flowers were gorgeous. We were able to see the bouquet the day before the wedding and made small adjustments, so it was exactly what I wanted the day of the wedding. I thought it was absolutely beautiful. I’d recommend to anyone.

From our first meeting with Claire to discuss our floral needs for our wedding day, we knew we’d be in good hands. Claire is attentive, straight forward and creative in making our ideas a reality. On our wedding day, every floral piece was brought to each location on time and appeared more beautiful than we imagined. We could not have been happier in our decision to go with Alex Waldbart Florist! - Mervin & Ema (May 2025)

The staff at Wildflowers blew us away for our wedding! I mainly worked with Joanna leading up to the wedding, and from the beginning of our meetings she listened to everything I wanted. She also provided much of her input when I needed some help deciding what would look good together. All of the arrangements on the wedding day looked beyond gorgeous! I only had colors in mind, Joanna helped us find the perfect flowers to match my style as well as the season. The staff who brought the flowers out that day were so helpful and willing to adjust when we had to make adjustments due to the weather. We could not have been more pleased with their work and customer service. They made the process easy and the flowers were beautiful!

Sisters Floral Design Studio is absolutely amazing! I cannot recommend them enough. They are personable, detail-oriented, and went above and beyond to make our wedding beautiful. They did EVERYTHING from set up, transitions, and tear down. Our wedding was in Forest Park a week after the tornado hit so we knew flowers would be a big part in beautifying our space. I was blown away with all of their work!

I came to see Craig on some days that were clearly insanely busy for him. Nonetheless, the flowers I received for my wedding were gorgeous, exactly what I wanted. It was clear that he had listened closely and given thought to the color combos I loved, even on my small wedding budget. His shop is inspiring, his team is friendly, and his shop pets are adorable. I recommend Craig Sole Designs not just as a florist, but as an entire wedding experience.
