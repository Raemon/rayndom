Tesla is absolutely phenomenal!! She took all my different visions and ideas and put them into one dream day! From the big details down to the little itty-bitty ones that nobody would think of she did, and it was made perfect! She made it a day that I will want to relive over and over again. She even helped me get a stain out of my wedding dress! She takes any problem or issue and diverts it into a solution, makes it like it was never existing in the first place. We will forever use Tesla at all of our events. She’s truly amazing at what she does!

Best Buds Flowers was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. Their communication throughout the planning process was polite, effective, and very pleasant. They were attentive to our vision and needs, and the floral arrangements they created for our ceremony and reception were of excellent quality – detailed, vibrant, and delivered right on schedule. The value they provided for the cost was outstanding, and we couldn’t have been happier with the final result. We highly recommend Best Buds Flowers to any couple looking for a reliable, professional, and talented florist for their big day.

We found Bloom and Bramble when we were in a bit of a bind—just three weeks before our wedding, our original florist was injured and unable to continue. I reached out to several florists, and Bloom and Bramble responded right away. Despite it being the busy June wedding season, they made room for us, which truly felt like a miracle. Vicki quickly got to work, listened to our floral vision, and immediately sent a thoughtful proposal. We were so grateful for their responsiveness and willingness to step in on short notice. In addition to being extremely efficient and professional to work with, their arrangements were stunning! They were exactly what we had envisioned—traditional and garden-inspired, while still feeling fresh and on-trend. The bouquets, boutonnieres, and arch flowers all held up beautifully in the 95º heat at our outdoor ceremony. Vicki and her team, part of this wonderful family-run business, are true expert florists. She even included some special touches from her own garden, which made the arrangements feel that much more personal and unique. We couldn’t have been happier with how everything turned out.

Wow, I seriously cannot say enough good things about Wildflower and Willow!! They exceeded all my expectations and created my dream wedding floral! They were so amazing to work with! They paid close attention to every little detail and were so quick to respond! Marcie is so knowledgeable about each flower and knew how to get me the bouquet of my dreams that wasn’t going to break the bank but would look just as perfect!! They were seriously so amazing to work with! I would recommend them to every single bride!!

Throughout wedding planning and the wedding day itself, Laura was hands down the best person we could have ever asked for. We had several zoom meetings prior to the wedding and she always made sure everything was taken care of. The flowers beat my expectations by a long shot, everything was absolutely beautiful and just so perfect. I couldn’t recommend Laura Lee more!! She was so amazing!

Kaitlyn was really easy and fun to work with. I’m not creative at all, so I told her what colors and a specific flower I wanted and she took care of the rest! She did a fabulous job!
