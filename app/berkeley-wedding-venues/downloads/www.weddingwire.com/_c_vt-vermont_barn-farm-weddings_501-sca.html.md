We consider this venue an excellent value for the price. The property is gorgeous both outside and inside. Our coordinator was Elizabeth, and she was excellent! Her communication was prompt and she really listened/helped us achieve what we wanted during the planning process as well as the execution throughout the day! We felt comfortable and welcomed by all staff. The food was wonderful, as were our bartenders and servers. We highly recommend utilizing Meadows Edge Floral Design; Gayle made our vision come to life. We also loved working with Mike from Top Hat Entertainment; he totally delivered. The Linen Shop also gave us exactly what we needed for linens for rehearsal dinner as well as reception. For hair/make-up we went with Hillary Fay Studios who were 10/10. And of course, our photographers were Mountain Hearts Photography, who were incredible! All of our vendors knew each other and were very familiar with MTR and the staff. They all worked together effortlessly. It was a perfect day!

Bridal suite is stunning!!! There is an amazing view of the mountains from the barn, perfect for fall foliage. The venue is extremely private with no simultaneous events going on, and all personal requests we had are being accommodated. They also have preferred vendor for every need, which not being from the Rutland area was a huge help! Very happy we chose this location as there are many options out there.

I had wanted to get married at Trapp for as long as I can remember. The mountain backdrop is unforgettable and the entire property grounds are beautiful. From start to finish, everyone at Trapp was so kind, helpful, responsive and professional. The wedding coordinators at Trapp, Saunie and Caroline, are very experienced and organized and know what it takes to make sure you have the best day of your lives. They also just truly care about you. Our wedding day was so stress-free because they took care of everything behind the scenes. The food was excellent, with many options for you to choose from. Our guests are still raving about our wedding. I would have no hesitation recommending Trapp Family Lodge for anyone else's wedding. Thank you to everyone at Trapp!

We just had our wedding here at the beginning of August and I cannot recommend this venue enough. Kristin and Daniel are amazing, so helpful, so laid-back, and kind. We were able to set up the wedding with family and friends and it was so wonderful to have the time and opportunity to work together with everyone without any pressure from the venue in terms of requirement or timing. It was such a beautiful wedding, the space is amazing and the area is fantastic. We’re not from northern Vermont, so many of our guests had to travel long distances to come to the wedding. Once everyone arrived and saw Crofter’s Green and the surrounding area, they all told us that they completely understood why we chose the space and how special it was to get to celebrate in it. This was the absolute best venue we could have chosen for our wedding and everyone from our family to our guests was just so excited about the location. We spent the night before the wedding around the fire with our friends and after the reception we had another fire and I got to sit there in my wedding dress just soaking it all in with everyone. Crofter’s Green allows you to have the exact wedding you want, and that was exactly what we were able to do.

We were married at Boorn Brook Farm on July 2, 2019 and we loved the stunning location from the ceremony up on the hill to the reception in the courtyard. Our host, Jeff Nyweide, ensured that our special event was a fairy tale remembered by all. The atmosphere was festive and warm and the farm is set in just the most gorgeous valley surrounded by rolling hills, mountain peaks and a burbling brook in the background. Everyone that worked with us to plan our wedding and was there on the day was so kind, polite, and helpful. Nancy Andrews, our wedding planner, is a gem and made sure everything was running smoothly from the moment we contacted her a year before the wedding to the actual day of the ceremony. Jeff and Nancy put in hours of communication via phone and email, since we were planning throughout the year from over 10,000 miles away in Australia, and they answered every single question we had. Plus they anticipated details we never would have thought of and were so easy to work with. I don't think we can truly put into words how magical our wedding at Boorn Brook Farm was, so hopefully some of the pictures below will help. We are forever grateful that we chose the Boorn Brook Farm as our special place to get married and highly, highly recommend it as a wedding venue!

We had such a beautiful and magical wedding day and I don't think I have the words to express how much of a wonderful experience we had at the Grafton Inn. As soon as we visited the venue, we felt like it was meant to be. All of the spaces are beautiful, and we were lucky to be able to rent two of the houses so that we could get ready with our friends on the morning of the wedding. From the whole planning process to the actual day, we felt so supported and it honestly felt like we were planning this wedding with friends. Olivia and Roma were on top of everything, always offering the best advice and taking our needs to heart. They worked tirelessly to make sure we had the best day ever, and were helpful and kind. There is so much talent at the Grafton for events, as well as passion and joy for wedding planning. The whole team showcases an immense amount of enthusiasm for making sure that your big day is a special and joyful celebration. All of our guests came to us throughout the wedding and even months later and were blown away by the wedding experience. I wish we could relive our big day over and over again, but we were lucky to at least experience it once. The best decision we made was to get married at the Grafton Inn!

We had the BEST wedding at the Old Lantern in November 2025! The barn was absolutely beautiful for our reception and was a perfect size for our guest count (140ish). We lucked out with the weather in being able to have our ceremony outside right by the barn, but had the option to have it inside the barn (which would have still been a wonderful option). All of the staff we worked with throughout the entire planning process were so kind and helpful, and they made the wedding day itself run so smoothly. We really liked that catering by Backyard Bistro was partnered with the Old Lantern so we didn't have to worry about finding an outside vendor. We rented the barn for the whole weekend (Friday-Sunday) which gave us plenty of time to set up and take down without feeling rushed. We also rented the Inn on site to stay in with our wedding party for the weekend and it was such a great decision because it let us be right on the property and it was so fun to spend extra time with our friends each night. Our hair and makeup artists were able to come to us and all the girls got ready in the large common space in the Inn while the boys got ready in the parlor suite in the barn. There were so many great places for photos between the inn and the barn and our wedding pictures were beautiful. We are so grateful for this venue and would HIGHLY recommend it for your wedding!

We had our wedding at the West Mountain Inn in August and I could not be happier with our weekend! Amie made sure everything was super smooth from the moment we arrived Thursday until we left on Sunday. Working with her to plan the wedding is a fun and exciting experience, as she takes the stress out of everything. The venue itself is gorgeous, with many different areas to plan events throughout the weekend. The rooms at the inn are so cute, but also updated, and we had a great time getting ready in the bridal suite. If you are looking for a beautiful and relaxing VT venue, it doesn't get better than this!

We could not recommend Tourterelle enough as a wedding venue! It was an absolutely gorgeous setting, perfect for what we were looking for, with amazing service and wonderful staff. If you stay in the attached inn, it is gorgeous and comfortable. We worked with Michaela Davico throughout our planning process and she was so responsive, knowledgeable, and thoughtful with all of our hundreds of planning items for the wedding. We were able to really customize our day. Michaela made us feel at ease with her experience and knowledge of local vendors. The food at Tourterelle is completely out of this world! They accommodated all of our dietary restrictions and special requests, including my very complicated ones as the bride, which was so appreciated and allowed me to fully enjoy the day. Tourterelle worked really well with our other vendors. We felt that we could really be present because of Michaela’s thoughtful coordination.

If you want a perfect Vermont wedding weekend, Lareau is the way to go! Helen helped make the whole wedding planning process so much easier, and coordinated with outside vendors so we didn't need to worry about it all weekend. Everything went so seamlessly thanks to Helen and the full staff. All areas of the venue (ceremony site, tent, pavilion, and inn) are beautiful and so charming. It was so special to have the inn to ourselves and our guests for the weekend. Highly recommend!
