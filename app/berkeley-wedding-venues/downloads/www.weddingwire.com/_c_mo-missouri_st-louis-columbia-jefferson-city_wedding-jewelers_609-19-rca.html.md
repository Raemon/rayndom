Let me start by saying I have never, not even once, been so impressed by a business that I’ve taken the time to write a review online, and if I could rate any higher than 5/5 stars, I would. I hadn’t shopped at Genovese Jewelers before we began shopping for my engagement ring, but a close friend of mine said he had a great experience working with a sales associate named Nick. I called and asked to speak with him to explain that I had a very specific ring design in mind. I told him it was really important to me that i be able to design it, and that I had a VERY detailed sketch of what I envisioned in my head. He said they could absolutely accommodate me so I made an appointment. They greeted me at the door with friendly smiles and offered me a bottle of water. I was really impressed with our initial sit-down and I decided then and there to go with them. Right off the bat all of our experiences there have been absolutely wonderful. Nick and the rest of the Genovese team, including the awesome owner Joe, and his wife Nicole, are incredibly accommodating, easy to communicate with, patient, and flexible. Genovese Jewelers is a family-owned business that truly sets the bar high. Each time I visited throughout the design process, they graciously hung in there w/me through several changes/modifications I specified along the way. Their incredibly skillful, creative designers crafted an absolutely stunning and exquisite ring for me that is everything I could’ve dreamed of and more. Regardless of the reason I visit I always feel like a VIP. They offer to clean my ring every time I stop by, before I even get a chance to ask! My fiancé and I couldn’t have been happier working with anyone else. I have been complimented on my ring countless times and I always pass along my recommendation. So many thanks to Nick, Tom, Joe and Nicole, and the rest of the Genovese

I bought the groom's wedding band here and had my ring cleaned here before my wedding (for free!). 2-3 weeks before the wedding, we scoped out rings at the mall (STL Galleria & St. Clair County) and online. All the mall vendors were asking at least $299 for the ring, one said they charged extra for engraving, another wasn't sure if they could even get it engraved in time for the wedding. Reiniger's provided the same ring for $100 less, and did the engraving for FREE and in less than a week. I hardly wear any jewelry but if I did I would be frequenting this business regularly.

Randi worked with me to create a special necklace using an aquamarine stone from my grandmother's ring. I'd been holding on to it since I was a child, waiting for the perfect occasion. Mid-way through the project I asked if there would be a way to incorporate my grandmother's engagement ring into the necklace (thinking it would be unlikely) and she quickly dazzled me with a design that was brought to life a couple weeks later. She even took the initiative to locate earrings that matched the stone perfectly, so I was able to wear this stunning set on my big day. Randi is a joy to work with; her creativity and energy are truly special!

I will not go to any other jeweler now that we have been to Moritz Reusch. John took his time with us and explained anything that we had questions on and was completely honest with us up front. We did look around at other shops before and after our meeting, but the professionalism, quality and personal experience really sold us. He took his time with us, we were not rushed, did not feel any pressure (I can't say the same for ANY other place). He encouraged us to look around and compare prices and quality of the product. Needless to say, we sat on it for the weekend, but knew we wanted to do business here. Even though my fiance had a custom ring ordered, it only took about 2 weeks at most to get it and it was everything we had imagined! I will definitely be recommending them to anyone and everyone. They truly made our buying experience very pleasant and we felt like we left with new friends!

When I started looking for a diamond I had no idea what I was doing. After doing a fair amount of research, I stumbled upon Lumera. The resources on the website confirmed a lot of what I found in other places. I began making a list of diamonds and called to speak with a diamond consultant. My call was returned quickly and was very helpful in going over the pros and cons of each individual diamond. He even ruled out more expensive diamonds that I enquired about. I was a touch nervous about ordering online but he assured me that the diamond I settled on fit all the criteria that I had laid out. When it arrived I was most pleased with the finished product. I got a nice thumbs up from my jeweler as well, who helped me get the diamond into an amazing setting. The customer service was excellent and the whole process was much less stressful than I had anticipated.
