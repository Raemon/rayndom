Fun Venue!

I was surprised when I initially found out that the venue hosts wedding events and caters! Elisa and her team made the entire process A to Z straight forward and supported my husband and I. The venue is great so the guests don’t have to feel like they have to stay on one place. Guests were able to explore the museum and the touch tank was popular!

Unique, classy, and ridiculously fun venue!

The Maritime Aquarium is a fantastic venue! I won't really comment on the food or service from the caterers (although both was excellent), since the Aquarium is currently switching their designated caterer and your future experience may be different. But the space itself is fantastic! There are so many great photo opportunities inside, and the nearby park along the waterfront makes for some beautiful backdrops for outdoor photos.  
  
Our ceremony was held in the cafeteria. If, like me, you might be worried that your big day could smell like hot dogs, put your mind at ease--it's actually a gorgeous space, and when the tables are put away, you can barely tell it's a dining room. Wooden beams support a high, airy ceiling with lots of windows. The red brick walls and iron accents make the space feel warm and welcoming, while also recalling the building's origins as an ironworks. A HUGE ceremony might be awkward to hold here, since the pillars could block the view for some guests in the back, but it was perfect for our gathering of around 75 people.  
  
We did cocktail hour among the exhibits, which was beautifully atmospheric and provided an exciting space for people to offer their congratulations and get to know one another. The Newman's Own Hall, where we did dinner and dancing, was plenty big enough for dinner tables and a sizable dance floor... though honestly, once dinner was over, our guests were so busy at the touch tanks that not everyone had time to dance.  
  
You should be aware that whatever seasonal decor is in place at the time of your wedding likely cannot be changed. For instance, our June wedding was accented with giant rainbow banners for Pride Month. I barely noticed, but a few of our guests commented on it, so if you have a very specific "look" in mind for your wedding, it's something to be aware of. Also, don't count on any specific animals to be present--they may be asleep (especially the seals), hiding, or off exhibit during your event.  
  
Like all aquariums, this one books up WAY in advance. We booked a year out and we only barely got the date we wanted. Make your plans far enough ahead so that you don't wind up disappointed.  
  
Getting married here is a really special experience--I'll never forget the moment when I pulled my new husband aside for a quiet moment in front of the flamboyant cuttlefish, watching hypnotic waves of colors roll down its body. I would wholeheartedly recommend the Maritime Aquarium to any prospective couple.

Uncomparable! Our guests all raved about the service, the waitstaff, the venue and the food. Philip Stone's staff was incredible. They were responsive to all our needs. I heard from many of our guests that it was the best wedding they've ever been to. I know all this sounds a bit gushy, but I really can't say enough about Elizabeth (who took over mid stream) and her staff!

I could not have been happier with my experience at the Maritime Aquarium. Basically, we had a tour and said "this is it". They were accomodating and professional. They have several styles of tables and chairs and colors of linens which is included in the facility rental. The cocktail hour is actually IN the aquarium so your guests can enjoy watching the fish along with cocktails and appetizers. The food (provided by the on-site catering service, Philip Stone Caterers) is excellent. We got the lowest price option which was a buffet dinner and it was not a mad rush to the food. Everything was arranged beautifully. I had high expectations to begin with but everything from the food to the service exceeded my expectations.

This venue is a great value and our wedding day itself was handled perfectly. The venue delivered exactly what they said they would and we had a great day. My only complaint was their responsiveness to emails leading up to the day. It didn't seem that I could get an answer on any questions until a month out from the wedding day. Like I said, everything worked out beautifully - they really know what they are doing - but I would have liked more timely answers to my questions.
