Mitchell’s brought my vision to life!

My fiancée wanted a unique engagement ring - something no one else would have that also told the story of our relationship. Unsure what to do with that direction, I went to Mitchell’s given their expertise in customer design.   
  
On top of the vague instructions, I also gave them a tight timeline in order to be sure I had the ring for an upcoming trip where I planned to propose. Mitchell’s knocked it out of the park on all fronts! They created a one-of-a kind ring, bringing me into the design process which made the experience all the more special. At each step of the process, I was blown away by how the ring came to life. Mitchell’s use of CAD allowed us to customize the ring together, in real time. They kept me on track and even jumped through a few hoops with their vendors to ensure the ring was perfect and ready to go when I needed it.  
  
Their team is friendly, competent, and professional. Their work brought my fiancée to tears - it is the ring of her dreams. I highly recommend Mitchell’s!

Amazing custom engagement ring!

Mitchell and Lisa were so incredibly helpful with my engagement ring! They walked me through all the options and considerations, and worked very hard to design and craft a custom ring on a quick timeline. They are very knowledgable about every aspect of fine jewelry. My fiancée loves the ring! Mitchell and Lisa were flexible, responsive, prompt, and supportive of the choices we made for the ring. I 100% recommend going to them for custom jewelry!

Exceptional service and people 

From the first day walking in they were welcoming and eager to help me find what I was looking for. We went through a bevy of different options and they helped me narrow in on my selection. The process was clear and very well explained. They made this whole thing easier for me and i can’t thank them enough.
