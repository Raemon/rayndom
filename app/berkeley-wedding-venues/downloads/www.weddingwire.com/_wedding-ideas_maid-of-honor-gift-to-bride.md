Your BFF is finally tying the knot, and you've been crowned [maid or matron of honor](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/maid-of-honor-vs-matron-of-honor) to stand by her side through it all. Whether she's just announced her engagement or the wedding is days away, you might be looking for a maid of honor gift to give the bride as an extra little token of your love and support. Lucky for you, there are plenty of opportunities to pick up something sweet and sentimental that'll get the message across. Whether you're shopping for a pre-wedding party or the wedding day, we're here to help. 

## Should the Maid of Honor Get the Bride a Gift?

Does the maid of honor get the bride a gift? Generally speaking, yes. [Giving gifts is customary](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/do-bridesmaids-groomsmen-give-wedding-gifts) for the wedding party. (That is, unless the couple has expressed that they don't want presents from their VIPs.) Usually, this includes gifts for the engagement, the bridal shower, and the wedding itself. When it comes to [deciding how much to spend](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-much-to-spend-on-a-wedding-gift), stick to an amount that's comfortable for you. Engagement and bridal shower gifts don't have to cost as much as the wedding present, and you're also free to team up with the crew to purchase a group gift. Finally, don't be afraid to go off-registry if it better suits your budget or your extra-special relationship with the bride.
