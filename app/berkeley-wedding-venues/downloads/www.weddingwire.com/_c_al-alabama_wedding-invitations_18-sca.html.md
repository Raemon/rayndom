We were so pleased with the quality and value of the wedding invitations that we ordered from Invitation Elegance. I have received so many compliments from my family and friends. After we placed the order I received an email from a Diana that caught a spelling error on our invitations. I so appreciated their quality control and making sure that everything was perfect. They were fast and the quality of the paper, envelopes and printing is first rate. Price wise they were 20-30% below the many other sites I checked and had ordered samples from. I highly recommend this company and will be using the again for thank you notes and other events.

I absolutely LOVED my wedding invitations from Stacey Day. In planning my wedding, I wanted to incorporate one of my favorite designs that was representative of my family and our New Orleans background - the classic fleur de lis. I knew I wanted it on the invitation but didn't know how to translate it throughout the wedding. I also knew I wanted a fleur de lis and a design that was unique. I did some research on invitations and decided I wanted a vellum overlay to envelope the actual invite, held together with a ribbon. I went to Stacey Day with my ideas. She worked on several options, creating a beautiful, modern fleur de lis that actually resembled my new monogram, "W". It started as a subtle, clever detail added to the top of my invitation, and then was repeated on the vellum. It soon became the inspiration for my wedding. I loved it so much, I ended up using it for my wedding cake, programs and guest favors. She worked late nights sending me designs and really listened to what I wanted. She took my ideas and made my vision a reality. I highly recommend Stacey Day for your big day and all your stationery needs.
