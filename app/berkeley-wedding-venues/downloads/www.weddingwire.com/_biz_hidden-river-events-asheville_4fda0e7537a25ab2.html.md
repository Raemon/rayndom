The perfect day!

This venue was beyond perfect! Not only is the property absolutely stunning, but they made the whole process so easy and were incredibly helpful. As a person who doesn't like making decisions, it was so helpful to have so many options already included with the venue. All the vendors they use are amazing and contributed to a perfect day for us. The flowers were so so beautiful, the food was delicious, and the DJ matched the vibe of the party perfectly. You can tell they have been doing this for a while and know how to do it right! We got so many compliments about our wedding day. It was exactly what we wanted, thank you so much for helping our perfect day come true!

Recent Uninformed Review

My daughter and husband were married at this site in June 2022. We toured in fall of 2021, after what was then a serious flood. We, like most of the people who use this venue, arranged to stay on the site with the full wedding party and family members for 3 full nights and 4 days. So unlike the individuals that are commenting, we have first hand knowledge of the venue, the staff and the owner. First, the area that is shown fully flooded recently, is well above where past flooding has occurred. There is no way that anyone with knowledge and experience with this property would ever have thought that those upper pastures would flood at such a high level. Look at the picture of the reception tent. Water is almost to the tent level which is close to 9-10 feet off of the ground. This tent sits 400-500 yards from the river and is elevated from the river area in two progressions. The flood in 2021 didn't make it past the ponds at the first progression. No one could have anticipated anything like this. I would ask the individual who took this video that has caused all these callous comments that if they were so intelligent and had such foresight, why did they remain on the property during the storm or for that matter why did they book a venue that they knew would flood so dangerously? And the answer is simple, because they didn't know what was going to happen. Just like the owners and staff did not know or anyone else for that matter in the entire region. Please have a bit more empathy for people who are suffering and have lost maybe everything they have. I have met them and worked with them, seen them with their animals and I know that they are distraught over what has happened, so callously commenting with no first-hand knowledge of the geography or people just to make yourself feel better about your views on animal well-being has done no one a service, but has materially impacted real human beings. Good human beings.

So so beautiful 

Our day was so perfect! Haley and Grace were so easy and wonderful to work with during the planning process. Having most vendors in-house and “included” in the pricing made things very streamlined. We got endless compliments from our guests, and the property was in full bloom and so beautiful for our July wedding. Don’t be scared of a summer wedding!! The florists Kari and Whitney took my vision and executed it better than I could have ever imagined! I asked them to do things they had never done before, and they absolutely crushed it, making every detail perfect and making our day that much better! The day moved seamlessly from pre-ceremony drinks to our beautiful ceremony under the tree, back to the garden bar for cocktail hour, and then to the tent for the reception.   
  
My only heads up for future couples planning a wedding would be to really understand the pricing up front on what’s included and what isn’t. It’s in the contracts, but we didn’t realize some pricing with housing on the venue, so we undercharged our guests staying at the venue - by a lot - and we didn’t realize cocktail hour food wasn’t included in the original catering costs at first. So things ended up being a bit more than we originally anticipated but it was all worth it! Also make sure you have someone that is willing to be your worker bee the day of your wedding. We brought in a lot of stuff on our own so we were responsible for setting that up. Luckily I had a great organized friend that crushed it but something to think about it you’re wanting to add a lot of personalized touches.

The Happiest Day Of My Life

Hidden River Events is the most amazing place I have had the pleasure of booking with. My wedding was a dream come true and my Husband has said it was the happiest day of his life.  
  
Booking with them was very easy. When I saw that they were an all-inclusive venue, I was a bit skeptical. But after speaking to them, everything fell into place. HRE was indeed all-inclusive. The contract was sent immediately, and instructions were quite clear to follow. All of the communication between Grace and Haley was prompt, professional, and polite. They answered all of our questions and concerns, even the last minute details that seemed to pop up.   
  
I would recommended this venue to everyone who is looking for a place for an outdoor wedding. There are many ceremony sites to choose from and everything is beautiful. All the staff were professional and friendly, very easy to talk to and lovely to work with.

Every detail was beautiful

When you drive into Hidden River, you see the beautiful white reception tent in the middle of a green field, rolling mountains in the distance, horses and goats grazing behind wooden fences, flowers, trees, and of course, the hidden river. But, Hidden River is so much more than just a beautiful wedding venue, it’s not just a place where weddings are hosted, it’s a place where love is nurtured. The team at Hidden River cares deeply, and we felt heard and valued and supported throughout the entire planning process, from the flowers to the food to the details of the ceremony.   
  
Hidden River Events can certainly describe themselves as an “all inclusive” wedding venue, given the number of different services that can be included with your contract. We decided to go with their included caterer (Anne’s Custom Catering) and florist (Hidden River Flowers) and were thrilled with that choice. We also really appreciate the option to bring our own vendors for photography and videography, as we had some specific people we wanted to work with. Throughout the planning process, Grace and Haley were always on hand to help us with any questions or requests we had, helping us to stay organized and focused. Lastly, we also asked Jeanne (the owner of Hidden River Events) to be our officiant, and we were absolutely blown away with the level of attention and care she gave us, helping us to have exactly the ceremony to match us and our relationship. Hidden River really goes above and beyond to make weddings special, and we are truly forever grateful for all that they did!

Feel like more than a number 

Hidden river,  
The venue owner radiates love, open nature and a kind heart. Which made a HUGE impact on our day and beginning steps of our marriage. The property is not only lovely-there is a peaceful presence surrounding every blade of grass there. We loved our day and how magical the venue and staff made it for us and our family! The next day we stayed on property and celebrated our families coming together surrounded by the river, and nature. A grounding end to an eventful season. It was a pleasure to be in your venue and have your love surround us on our day!

The most magical day in May

I can't say enough great things about our wedding experience at Hidden River!! This was a destination wedding for us with a guest list of 35 people and everything from the planning process to the day of, everything was so simple which made it even more enjoyable for us to focus on our special day. The scenery there is really incredible and made our photos magical. Erica our photographer was incredible, the food we chose - fajitas, pie dessert bar and cutting cake were excellent. Bar staff and DJ were also absolutely fantastic. I would absolutely recommend Hidden River Events for your wedding in the Asheville area.

Our Wedding on 4.6.24

We had a great experience with Hidden River Events for our wedding on 4/6/24. We got a Saturday package for a wedding of up to 75 guests. Everything was wonderful from the planning to the day-of. It was also generally affordable for the area and the quality of what you get for the price. For the price you get a DJ, photographer, bartender, caterer, flowers, and a day-of-coordinator. We also particularly loved the housing options that are on-site since this was a destination wedding for us and for our guests. The houses had mostly everything that we needed for our stay that week. On the wedding day, it was magical from the horse-drawn carriage to the ceremony site next to the river. It was picturesque and perfect. I highly recommend choosing Hidden River Events for your wedding!
