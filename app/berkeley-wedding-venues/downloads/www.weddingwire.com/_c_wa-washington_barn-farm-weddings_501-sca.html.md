this wedding venue and it’s absolutely beautiful. The grounds are really well kept, and the whole place has such a pretty, welcoming feel to it. Every area flows nicely, and there are so many great spots for photos. Definitely worth checking out if you’re looking for a gorgeous venue with a great atmosphere.

I cannot say enough good things about this venue - they are a dream come true! We came to Kiana about a year before the wedding with a 2-ceremony vision. Pam, Leslie, and the Kiana team gave us a tour and came back to us with a reasonable plan and quote. They were willing to set up the dining room twice, the wedding ceremony chairs twice, with a quick clean up in between ceremonies! Additionally, they had worked with our planner before and had a good relationship. The space itself is gorgeous. The flowers, the water, the garden, just amazing! There were seals playing and eagles soaring throughout the day. The fact that this is a private property that only hosts one wedding at a time was also something that I found really special and helpful. There is no chance of random people poking their heads in or running into another wedding - the venue is yours for your day, this was really important to us. The food at Kiana is also great :) We wanted to serve a traditional indian/nepali lunch after our first ceremony, and Kiana's chef, Cesar, learned the recipes and cooked the dishes himself!! We had a tasting a couple months before the ceremony with some minor notes and the lunch on the wedding itself came out perfect! They even accommodated some new appetizer recipes for cocktail hour! The dinner was great, and the bar lines were manageable (something we had asked them to be mindful of).

We wanted to have a small wedding with approximately 100 people and wanted a place where we could have everyone enjoy the ceremony and reception at the same place. Carleton Farms definitely checked those boxes. Laura was great to us, immediately scheduling an appointment to show us around. It didn't take long for us to decide that this is where we wanted to have our big day. From our first visit, we saw a beautiful venue that had a lot of potential. However upon our 30 day check in we were surprised to see they had added on a viewing platform (with apple and pumpkin cannons to boot) just past the fire pit. Laura was great in adjusting our schedule to fit our time without breaking out budget. Never at any point did we feel pressured by her. The day of our rehearsal we were surprised to be greeted by Cheryl and more shocked that Laura was no longer there. This point would normally stop most but Cheryl immediately took care of us without hesitation. She continued with the professionalism and compassion that Laura had shown us. Wedding day rolls by and both Cheryl and Angel were friendly and helpful with our set up and coordinating with our DJ and caterers. For our playground package the staff was great in taking care of parents and their little ones. We couldn't be happier with them taking care of everything and supporting us on our big day. If you're looking for a quiet, peaceful venue with plenty to do check them out. We'll be back!

We are a group of Seattle wedding planners who worked with Trinity Tree Farm for the first time this year. Throughout our working relationship, they treated us and our clients with kindness, consideration, and prompt communication. We were appreciative of the resources they provided throughout the planning experience that made things flow smoothly. They were also open to hosting new vendors on the property in preparation for the big day. Their attention to detail when it came to stewarding the property set up the wedding day for success. And of course, the space itself was a lovely place to host a laid back Pacific Northwest wedding celebration. We would highly recommend this venue and look forward to returning!

Firstly, I am not one to leave reviews, but just need to share. From the initial inquiry to day of the wedding, LHF couldn't have been a better venue to work with. I wanted something more formal and my fiancé wanted something rustic so this was a great choice. The grounds are stunning and provided so many different backdrops for photos (inside and out; see attached). Guests complimented the venue grounds over and over again. They also raved about the food and staff. I wanted a day with as few vendors as possible. The only additional vendors I needed was a DJ (Sounds Unlimited), DOC (Sophie Blaine) and Photographer (Isaac Gautschi). I used LHF Floral which was great as well. I rented their ice cream cart instead of cake and guests loved it! I loved that they had an indoor area as well in case it rained. That was a big selling point for us. I loved that their outside patio had some covering so guests weren't being scolded by he sun during cocktail hour. It was very close to Everett which was great for guests. And they had a ton of parking. Their response time to emails is timely and they never showed irritation by all my questions. They kept up and documented all the changes I requested throughout planning. I couldn't be happier that we chose LHF for our wedding! Pictures below by Isaac Gautschi.

Working in the wedding industry I have been to a lot of venues across the Puget Sound but when it came to my wedding I wanted something truly spectacular. In true professional fashion, I Googled “garden wedding venues” and Genesis popped up. When we toured the venue we instantly fell in love with it. We love the manicured English garden, the historic white barn, the spacious reception tent, and the many beautiful photo opportunities. Our guests all exclaimed that it was the most beautiful venue that they had been to and loved the surprise white pigeon release. It was full of colorful flowers, lush grass. We also appreciated that it had a very nice brides cottage and grooms cottage. At sunset we got the most stunning golden hour photos out in the field and on the swing. The venue owners were very kind and amazing to work with!

erra Valley Farms is an incredible venue! We knew from the first time we walked the grounds that this was a special location, and every one of our guests confirmed this by stopping to tell us how beautiful and perfect the whole place was. Whether it was their fields of berries and dahlias, winding garden paths, or open areas for lawn games, the natural beauty meant that we really didn’t need to do much for extra decor, and this in turn helped us save money to use elsewhere in our budget. The fact that they also offer wedding coordination and bartending services means there is a lot of value here and adding these services made our lives so much easier. We got to work with Tessa as our wedding coordinator, and she was the absolute best! Because she knows Terra Valley so well, she knew just how to make things run as smoothly as possible. Throughout the entire planning process and on the actual day, she and her team made us feel so at ease and well taken care of. Thank you, Tessa, for being our steady guide throughout this year of planning a wedding and thank you Chelsea for all the work you and your team do to make this such a special place!

Mountain Springs Lodge hosted our wedding in October 2022 and it was an absolutely fantastic experience! Everything was perfectly taken care of by the wedding coordinator Jaimi, I did not have to do anything myself but enjoy the day. We coordinated for months in advance and no detail was missed. Perfect location, perfect service and the cabins we stayed at were absolutely awesome! 5 stars!
