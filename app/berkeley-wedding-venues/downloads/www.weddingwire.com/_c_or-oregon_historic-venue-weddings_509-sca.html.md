Jennifer & staff did a great job for our wedding! The food was great & the set up was beautiful. The only thing I’d say we wish was different was the AC (wish it was cooler inside) & having a little bit more guidance as far as what to expect next - the day of. Would highly recommend this venue!

This venue was absolutely stunning. All of our guests are still talking about how incredible this venue was. We wanted to have a forest wedding with temperature controlled areas without taking away from the forest feeling. We also wanted a venue where we could be there all weekend. Camp Colton was everything we dreamed of. We did the wedding weekend package and Allison was wonderful! We arrived on a Friday and had our rehearsal dinner in the lodge because of the rain. Allison was there to help direct traffic and the parking attendants were amazing day of the wedding! The lodging was exactly what we were looking for and the fire pit was perfect for our smaller after party. One of the best parts is the groom's side had a place to hang out and get ready while the bride's side was getting ready. So many places we toured there was just a room for the groom's side, but our groom party had an entire lodge! We cannot recommend Camp Colton enough for your wedding if it is within your budget!

Revelry Park Avenue, LLC was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding event. Their communication was easy, inviting, and quick, which made the planning process seamless. The quality of their work and the value they provided was amazing - they have a wonderful in-house decor like beautiful chairs that really elevated the look and feel of our event. This venue is the perfect choice for couples looking for a modern, downtown vibe that is also intimate and full of history. So many details have already been added, yet the space is an easy canvas to make your own. I highly recommend Revelry Park Avenue for your wedding day!

Adrienne was excellent to work with. From start to finish she was attentive to our needs, finding solutions to our concerns and providing us with a perfect evening for the wedding rehearsal dinner. Everyone was very impressed with the room and the food was excellent. I highly recommend Jake's Catering.

The St. John’s Inn is truly a magical place for a wedding! Everything about our wedding weekend was quaint, eclectic, special and absolutely perfect. The details of the inn, having our bridal party stay on site and all be able to get ready the day of, the views from the yard of the bluff and forest park, literally each aspect of this place is truly amazing. The owner Tim was incredibly responsive, timely, professional and personable. From staying in the home to the ceremony and dinner, the experience felt very true to north Portland and the historic nature of the home. We found that the slightly unpolished and almost rustic vibe totally charming. Everything was exactly what we had envisioned for our special day.

We loved having our wedding at The Evergreen! They were easy to work with the space is incredible. We also were able to use Loyal Legion downstairs for our cocktail hour. Our guests had an amazing time! The bar staff upstairs and downstairs made sure that everyone had exactly what they needed.

Everyone at the Victorian Belle was a dream to work with, and the space was the perfect backdrop to our wedding. The house and grounds are beautiful, the staff is friendly, professional, and experienced, and the in-house catering is great. It was really nice to use their catering and tables, chairs, settings, etc. rather than have to find more vendors. We had our perfect wedding at the Victorian Belle and would recommend the venue to anyone.

The Walters Cultural Arts Center was a great choice for us. It fit our 150-200 attendees and helped accommodate our setup by allowing us to drop things off the day before the event. It's a beautiful atmosphere and has A/V and a screen as well. If parking was tight in their parking lot, excess parking was available across the street. Would recommend!
