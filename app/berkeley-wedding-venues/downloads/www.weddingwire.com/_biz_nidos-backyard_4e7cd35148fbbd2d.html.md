simply the best

nido's has always been our go-to spot for dinner, drinks, brunch, and a good time. we were stoked when we found out they did weddings and fell in love with the private event space "la plaza" within the colorful, festive, spacious outdoor patio venue we enjoy visiting regularly. we had our ceremony at roberts regional park, and then went to nido's for the reception. from the luscious plants decorating the space to the high quality food/drink service, we couldn't have asked for more. jenny - nido's event coordinator - was communicative and transparent about pricing throughout, and very responsive to all our questions. they even let us use their some of their older chairs that we preferred--the restaurant had switched out older chairs with new ones due to quality concerns but they met some of our guests needs' better (fat folks - wider seats). all our vendors were also pleased with the collaboration and had what they needed to succeed (dj tech stuff, table, etc). for an all inclusive bar, dinner, apps, cocktail hour, late night snack, and desserts, nido's was a great value! highly recommend.

Wedding and Event Planner Approved!

I have had the pleasure of working with Nido's since they started doing events at their location. The food is wonderful, staff is great and the location is beautiful.   
  
As a planner I work closely with the client and the staff to make sure the client has everything the need to have a great event and Nido's never disappoints.   
  
I would recommend this location over and over again. Oh and did I mentioned the food was yummy, lol.

Our perfect and delicious Fiesta!

We were married last fall in the beautiful La Plaza space at Nido's Backyard! I've never planned a wedding before, but I didn't expect the experience to be so easy. We splurged on flowers for the tables, but didn't need to do much to dress things up. We had a really fun band. They sounded so great! It was a hot day, but the shade of the roof kept the temp perfect and the wind that picked up in the evening went unnoticed in our area. The food and drinks provided by Nido's were amazing. So many people told me it was the best wedding food they'd ever had and the margaritas and wine were a hit! And the team at Nido's was great! Really took care of us from the planning and especially on our big day!
