I have always wanted to have a wedding reception at this museum, and it really was perfection. The staff set up all the tables and chairs right where we needed them, gave us the run of the upstairs galleries, and offered extra support during the event. It was perfect.

The museum was a perfect venue for a wedding reception. Guests were able to tour the museum during the evening! There was plenty of space for buffet food, dancing and guest seating. The patio was available as well for viewing the SLC valley. Erika and the staff were so easy to work with and very flexible. We felt like top priority from the start of the wedding planning process through the entire reception. Erika was in contact with all the various vendors so as the bride, I was not worried about anything besides enjoying the day and our guests. It truly was a magical night!!!

We chose the UMNH for it's unique decor and good price. They don't really provide any services other than table and chair rental, but we wanted to bring in all our own vendors so it worked for us. They let us take over the place and allowed us to stay later than initially planned. The location made for awesome photos and our guest had a great time! Other brides should note that they will not close the museum early (we had a ceremony and reception at 6pm) and they do not allow hard liquor.

Hello, My name is Emily and I feel like my WONDERFUL experience with the Aquarium needs to be shared: My aunt was very recently diagnosed with terminal cancer and was given 6 months to live. (My aunts name is Sharon) I contacted the Aquarium too see if we could come in a few minutes early to see the new butterfly exhibit before they opened because Sharon can't be around kids and crowds (due to her cancer). When I contacted the Aquarium they arranged for my family including my 90 year old grandfather, to have a private tour a few hours before they opened on February 5, 2018. They made arrangements for Sharon and us to not only see the butterflies but the whole Aquarium! They arranged for my aunt to hold the butterflies, witness the sloths lounging and we were able to meet Uno the penguin in person! We were just wanting to get Sharon to the butterflies while she felt healthy enough and they went above and and beyond! They arranged for their most experienced educator (Robert) to meet us and told us all about the amazing creatures the Aquarium housed! For the time in a long time, my family and aunt didn't think about cancer or the time she has left. My family and I got to feel like old times before Sharon was sick. Hearing that a loved one is terminally sick is one of the worst things you can experience and it's been really hard to find reasons to smile and laugh. This tour gave my whole family reasons to smile, laugh and be worry free. This was truly a family memory I will always treasure. Thank you, -Em
