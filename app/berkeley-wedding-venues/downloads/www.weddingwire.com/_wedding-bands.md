## Wedding Music Bands

Whether you envision a small ensemble as your [wedding guests](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-planning/wedding-guests-list.html) dine, or a large, lively band to provide the soundtrack as you dance the night away, the wedding music you choose is an important element of your Big Day. While musical tastes vary, we can all agree that there’s nothing quite like music to set the desired mood at an event.

Couples have two major options: hiring a [wedding DJ](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-djs) or finding the perfect live wedding music band to anchor the celebration. Along with playing any requested tunes and providing essential entertainment, a DJ or wedding music band leader also ensures that your event moves smoothly and fluidly from one amazing moment to the next.

If you decide to go with live music, selecting the right band is crucial. Here are some things to consider when picking your wedding music band.

## Choosing the Best Wedding Music Bands

Although your [wedding venue](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-venues) may have a list of musicians that they work with, you may not be limited to the names on it. Check the contract to see if you can bring in outside musicians. Also, be familiar with any noise restrictions at the venue, or the need for extra power supplies or any other equipment for your band. Keep in mind that a band will likely take up more space than a DJ, so make sure there are ample accommodations. As with other elements of wedding planning, the more information you have available about your wedding music band in advance, the more smoothly your actual event will run.

Couples should be aware that wedding live bands tend to be more expensive than a DJ – but this is a good area to splurge. A live band provides a rich sound and is a memorable option for your reception. Before booking, ask any potential bands if they are performing at any public events in the near future. If so, you can see them in person and decide if they fit your style. Otherwise, ask for some videos of past performances. After searching around, reading reviews and possibly seeing potential wedding bands perform, you'll be ready to make your selection.

## Selecting Songs for Your Wedding Music Band

Before your event, we recommend giving your chosen wedding music band two specific song lists. One should be songs and musical genres you absolutely want to hear, along with when you want to hear them (such as processional, recessional, first dance and mother-son/ father-daughter dance). The other list should be songs and musical categories you don’t want them to play.

Give some thought to your guests in attendance. While nobody is disputing that it's your special day, you also want your friends, family and loved ones to have a good time. You might add some classic songs and/or fast and slow songs to encourage everyone to dance.

WeddingWire offers plenty of resources for finding the right wedding live band to suit your musical desires. Don't forget to check online reviews for advice from couples who have previously hired your band. Start your search and find the live wedding music to complete your celebration!
