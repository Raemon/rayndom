I always order flowers from Forever Flowers. They are always fresh and last long in the arrangements they provide. My bouquet was breathtaking and although I couldn’t take it off island with me, my mom is taking good care of them for me at her house. They were even able to provide a courage and an additional boutonnière for my mom and brother the day before our wedding. I will always use Forever Flowers. They are just the best!

My husband and I got married at Oil Nut Bay in Virgin Gorda, BVI in November of 2021. After months of research trying to find a wedding florist in the BVI’s, I started broadening my search and found Roses Too in the USVI’s. I was instantly blown away by Jessica Aubain’s portfolio on Instagram, and without looking any further, I found her website and sent an inquiry. I quickly learned that there were a lot of moving parts associated with sourcing flowers from outside of the BVI territory, especially during COVID-19. The restrictions at the time made it nearly impossible for Jessica to travel for set-up, so she agreed to pre-assemble everything and FaceTime my wedding coordinator at Oil Nut Bay to finalize the placement of all the arrangements. The morning of the wedding, the flowers had to be loaded, shipped, clear customs, and the captain had to go through COVID-19 screening when arriving in the BVI’s. While there was some risk involved, I trusted that Jessica was going to do everything she could to get the florals to us, and above all, she understood my floral vision. I shared some inspiration photos and my color palette with Jessica, and she took it from there. They were the most stunning wedding florals I have ever seen. They literally brought tears to my eyes! I don’t think I ever shared this with Jessica; but, I told my husband that there were two things that were incredibly important to me on our wedding day: our florist and our photographer. I am an interior designer by trade; so, I can be pretty particular at times. Jessica is truly an artist. It is obvious that she is passionate about what she does because it shows through her work. We couldn't have been more pleased with how she executed EVERY LITTLE DETAIL beautifully. Our wedding florals were simply a dream come true, and we have Roses Too to thank for that. I could never thank Jessica enough for her amazing customer service, patience and communication throughout the entire process. She always made me feel like I was her only client, and I feel like I gained a friend her. My only wish is that I lived in the USVI’s so I could use Roses Too for future events! Thank you, Jessica from the bottom of our hearts! You contributed so much to our wedding bliss.
