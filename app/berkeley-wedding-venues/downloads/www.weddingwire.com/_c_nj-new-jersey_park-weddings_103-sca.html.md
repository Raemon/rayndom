We had our wedding at Piazza on 5/20/23. Despite having to move the ceremony indoors, we had an exceptional time. Rosalia and Mike are sure to cater to one wedding at a time, allowing them to focus on the important details of your special day! Food was delicious! I highly recommend having your next event there! Check out the beautiful outdoor garden too! Thank you for hosting my special day! 💗

As a regular camper at Triple brook camping ground. when it came time to planning our special event for me and my other half, I couldn't have thought of any other place, neither could my other half. The reason being is. We watch the old milk barn, become into this beautiful and most wonderful venue. But what made are special day even more wonderful was the theme for that weekend (which was Christmas in July (which is are favor time of the year). I think that the employees of the campground were more nervous than we were. The day was prefect and something to talk about for years to come. I would re

My wife and I got married here back on June 2023 and had an absolute blast of a time, not only did Steve and James meet all of our expectations they were also in our wedding and played key roles to ensure the atmosphere of it all felt so personal and adaptive to all our needs, these guys and their staff will go above and beyond to ensure everything goes beyond perfect. They will work with everything and if they have never done it before they are right on board making it become a dream come true, totally recommend these guys as they are very responsive and on top of everything and communicate every step of the way, they will ensure everything goes according to your plans. Not to mention they are great people to talk with as their personality are super friendly and fun making the experience that much more personal! Thanks guys !

I was searching venues to have a garden wedding and stumbled across the Reeves Reed Arboretum. The executive director, Jackie, was so attentive and answered every question I had. You can tell she truly wants you to have a wonderful event on the grounds. For our wedding, the first floor of the house was set up with bars for the cocktail hour and the doors opened up to a beautiful tented affair on the grounds. The grounds are so gorgeous. I got married in June and the gardens were in full bloom. They work with David Ellis Events, who is the the exclusive event planner/caterer. At first I was worried of not being able to have a selection in caterer but honestly it was the best thing that could have happen as David Ellis Events helped put together the most amazing and beautiful event. If you want beautiful garden wedding, please consider Reeves Reed

My husband and I had our wedding celebration at OTL on 9/30 and my goodness what a wonderful day it was! OTL has the best atmosphere for couples who are looking for a different vibe than a traditional wedding venue. All of our guests had so much fun with the various games and activities and the food was absolutely outstanding! Our guests are still raving about it. OTL made great suggestions and recommendations when it came to vendors and ideas to make our vision come to life. Our day was so much thanks to Sara, Pete, Darian and the entire OTL staff!

I am incredibly happy we decided to have our ceremony at Lucy. It was a unique experience that not many people can say they had. We got so much great feedback from our guests. Rich was great to work with. He was very responsive to all my emails and questions. They pretty much let us do whatever we wanted to the space. The night before at the rehearsal, we put up an arch decorated in flowers. We tied ribbons and bows on all of the railings etc. that were able to stay up the next day during the tours until our ceremony. I felt like the price was very reasonable considering they shut down the tours for pretty much as long as you ask them too. Also, its a non-profit. All the proceeds go to help keep Lucy open. Not to mention its tax deductible! If you decide to have your wedding at Lucy, just remember this place does not have a wedding coordinator! You definitely need to remember to designate someone to be your person in charge of making sure everything goes off without a hitch (music, seating of guests, walking down the aisle timing etc).

Becky Simone from Beach Bum Vacations did an outstanding job of planning a two week trip for ten people to Amsterdam, a Rhine River Cruise and Stresa, Italy. Becky is informative, detailed and easy to work with when planning a trip. The trip was one of the best we've on which we've gone. The Sir Albert Hotel in Amsterdam was near restaurants, museums, shopping and the tram. The Viking Riverboat Cruise was amazing. It was an excellent choice by Becky because the service and tours were top notch. The scenic drive from Switzerland to Stresa, Italy was a treat. The Regina Palace Hotel in Stesa was the grandest hotel I've ever stayed in. It was absolutely amazing with stunning lake views from the elegantly appointed rooms and common areas. Becky really did an awesome job of planning. I can't wait for the next trip!

We reserved a block of rooms and shuttle to our wedding venue. The staff was very professional, and flexible. Because many guests booked at the hotel but outside our block (be sure you get the best rate so people don't reserve on Expedia, etc.!), we needed to add an extra shuttle the day before the wedding. The hotel was very accommodating. Also, upon request with enough notice, the hotel bar stayed open until 1:00 a.m. for our guests. It usually closes at 10:00 p.m.
