Hiring Ben Lyons was easily one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. He is a truly talented musician, a professional DJ, and simply a wonderful person to work with. During our search, the cost savings and convenience of hiring one person to handle both our ceremony/cocktail music and the reception DJ services were a huge factor. Ben delivered on this promise flawlessly. The transition from his beautiful, live solo acoustic set during the ceremony and cocktail hour to the high-energy DJ reception was executed perfectly and felt completely seamless. It was the perfect "one-stop-shop" package. From the start, communication with Ben was outstanding—he was easy to reach and responded quickly to all our inquiries. We particularly appreciated his meticulous planning process. He provides a detailed form that guides you through every aspect of your wedding day preferences, and his extensive song lists allow you to specify exactly which songs you want or, just as importantly, which ones you don't want him to play. This level of organization made us feel completely confident in his hands. As a full-time musician, his professionalism and organization shine through. His ability to adapt on the fly was truly remarkable. When the father of the groom decided to give a spontaneous speech, I quickly mouthed the cue to Ben from across the room. He seamlessly announced the speaker, making the unplanned moment feel organized and intentional, rather than a disruption. Ben was overall just great to work with and a very kind human. He is organized, responsive, talented, and flexible—even able to adapt on the fly when needed. We wholeheartedly recommend Ben Lyons to any couple looking for a polished, talented, and affordable music solution for their entire wedding day.

Jason and his band were so amazing at our wedding. Our guests loved them so much that people chanted "encore" at the end of the night until the band came out again and played one more song. They had everyone dancing all night and were super professional and lovely people to work with. My husband's family has a big party up in Maine every year and all his family were saying how they want to hire Jason to do the party this year! I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great wedding band. Thanks, Jason!

Opus Trio was a beautiful addition to our wedding ceremony. They played for about a 1/2 hour as guests took their seats and then provided a mix of traditional, folk and contemporary music throughout different portions of the ceremony, including a custom song request to accompany one of our friends singing. Bill was very responsive in the planning process and I couldn't recommend Opus Trio highly enough for gorgeous and professional music for your wedding or event.

John performed at both our ceremony and reception, and was a huge hit. He was extremely professional and accepted every song request from Sting to Billy Joel. Not only is he a talented singer a guitarist, but was also an amazing fiddler much to the delight of my nieces who could not stop dancing. If we could get married again we wouldn't change a thing!

If you are looking for a professional talented harpist for your event.. look no further. Danielle played at our wedding and the music was exceptional from the prelude that she planned to the 2 new songs she learned to make our ceremony special - she nailed it. I walked down the aisle to "In Christ Alone" and was brought to tears as I sang to her performance. When we walked out to "You are the Best Thing" we were jumping for joy!! Thank you for being one of our vendors - we were blessed with a fantastic team-- you made our day!

We had a small "destination wedding" in Maine. We planned a Catholic Mass with just our families, followed by a larger outdoor ceremony and reception with the rest of our guests. The church was unable to provide music for our Mass, so we called Warren King at Live Music, and asked him to play the organ at our Mass. We had no idea what music to choose, so we asked him to just play whatever he wanted that was similar to Carolan's Welcome. Warren was extremely professional, selected beautiful songs, and played them very well. When he arrived at the church, he found a piano, not an organ as the priest had told us, and he quickly adapted his planned music to the piano. We were very satisfied with Warren's performance and his participation in our wedding ceremony. In addition to being a great musician, he is also a friendly, nice guy, and we were happy to have hired him. Great job - we definitely recommend him!!!

We called Andrew when our church organist couldnt play. I am so glad the organist was busy! AMAZING and CLASSICALLY ELEGANT. I was amazed at the beauty of our ceremony music and just how amazing it set the tone. We opted for a duet with violin and cello and it was just so wonderful. We used them for an hour of music at our reception also and people just loved them. They were so professional and classy. I am so impressed and so thankful that we chose to add them to our day. Amazingly affordable.

Ryan is awesome. We weren’t planning on having live music at the ceremony, but in the end he played the ceremony AND cocktail hour and it made the day! He is a talented musician and played beautifully, he’s extremely professional, and he’s super self sufficient which is a relief when you have tons of moving parts on the big day. He also helped to provide a mic for our outdoor ceremony, and all of his services were available at a fair rate. Book Ryan ASAP!
