Outdoor Ceremony Music in September

We had Olivia perform for our ceremony on Saturday, September 30th this year and were so happy to have her!! We decided to go with a trio, which was perfect for our outdoor 100+ ceremony. Olivia was easy to work with, very professional, and she had great ideas for music selections and the general flow. All my email communications with Olivia and our video planning meeting were timely and helpful. Her knowledge about the wedding process and ideas/thoughts about the ceremony helped me feel at ease about everything. As the bride, I didn't get to hear most of the music, but our guests loved it and said it was fun because they were even taking guest requests during the ceremony prelude! I'd recommend Olivia for any special event music. She can make the music selection casual and fun, or she can do something more formal...whatever your vision is. Thanks for helping to make our wedding special, Olivia

Strings for ceremony and cocktail hour

Olivia was a joy to work with. She actually did my sister's wedding back in 2018 and did such a lovely job that I had to have her do strings for my wedding and cocktail hour. She was professional and extremely talented. On our call a few months prior to the wedding we told her what we were thinking in terms of processional and recessional and what we were thinking for cocktail hour. She gave great recommendations and didn't shy away from anything we suggested. She was kind and fun to work with. Everything from our wedding day was perfect and she definitely had a huge role in ensuring that. Thank you Olivia!

Wedding ceremony music 

Olivia was great to work with, the whole process of booking was super easy. I was able to book Olivia within in hour of reaching out to her. She is very responsive and professional. The ceremony music was beautiful and a great addition to make our ceremony more memorable. Would definitely recommend checking out her website there are plenty of packages available with various price ranges that I think most people will be able to find something that fits.

Greenhouse Wedding

Olivia was a joy to work with from the beginning. Responsive, excited, and very professional. She is able to find other musicians if you wish to have a duo, trio, or quartet. She is very clearly passionate and brings her experience to her work. Her and her partner came out and played despite the heat melting everyone. I was especially impressed that despite all the guests leaving the area they were predicted to be in, the string duo CONTINUED to play. I found this to show a lot of professionalism and discipline. In the end all the guests leaving for another event room allowed for my new husband and I to have a brief private concert and an accidental first dance before we had to continue on with our days' schedule. This made for a very special memory on our day, and was my favorite moment during our wedding.   
  
To prepare working with this vendor, a little bit of research and an idea of what kind of songs you want can go a long way. If you dont have a prefence she has some excellant suggestions and can work very independently. For example they played very specific songs at our church ceremony, but later on at our second location they played Lord of the Rings music. And I dont think I ever knew the full playlist for cocktail hour but that was thankfully one more thing off my plate that we could completely trust Olivia with.   
  
I would highly reccommend Olivia if you are thinking about live string music for your event. I will be reccommending their work to my friends who are planning their weddings now, and a few already asked for her contacts.   
  
Thank you again Olivia for the amazing music you brought to our wedding.

Absolutely perfect 

I've known Olivia for many years, going all the way back to high school. She played solo cello at my wedding and it was absolutely perfect! Being a musician myself, I wanted to pick someone for my wedding that I knew would absolutely nail it, and Olivia definitely did! Olivia puts her entire heart and soul into everything she plays and always has. My guests talked about the live cellist for weeks after the fact. Olivia is an amazing cellist and a wonderful person to work with. You won't regret hiring her for all your cello needs!

Beautiful live music-- Hire immediately!

Olivia Polash and her fellow musicians were very professional and showed up wearing all black (my preference). They are absolutely talented beyond belief!  
They were on cue with all of the songs we chose to walk down the aisle to and hearing songs being played live while walking down the aisle just made that moment even more memorable!  
  
If you want to add a classy and personalized touch to your big day, or any event, hire her immediately! She is a wonderful communicator and has made the entire booking process extremely easy! 10/10 --I recommend!
