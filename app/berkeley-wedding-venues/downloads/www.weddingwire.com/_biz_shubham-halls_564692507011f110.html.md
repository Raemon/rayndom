**Why “SHUBHAM HAll”?**

In Sanskrit, _Shubham_ means **auspicious, blessed, and good fortune**. It’s more than just a name — it’s our promise to make every celebration feel like a joyful beginning filled with positive energy and lasting memories. WE'VE HOSTED HUNDREDS OF WEDDINGS AND WE KNOW EVERY DETAIL MATTERS. WE HAVE 3 AMAZING HALLS: **THE GRAND HALL** – 150–400 guests, with a built-in **dancefloor** , **LED screens** , and stage lighting for a spectacular reception. **THE COURTYARD** – 60–150 guests. Elegant and versatile, ideal for mid-size gatherings, cocktail receptions, or cultural ceremonies. **THE PAVILION** – Cozy and charming for intimate celebrations, pre-wedding events, or small family functions. **Capacity:** 40–80 guests.

**🎉 Entertainment - Ready Features** :

• Spacious **Dance Floors** (included in all halls) for your first dance & all-night fun

• **LED screens & stage lighting** for photos, videos, slideshows and live streaming

• Flexible layouts for intimate gatherings to grand receptions.

🍽 **Catering That Wins Hearts:**

Food is the soul of every event. At Shubham Halls, our chefs curate menus with:

**We do have 3 Signature Catering Packeges. Designed for every taste and budget from Vegetarian to Non-Vegetarian to Jain Specialties - all crafted with authentic Indian flavors and premium ingredients.**

You can select the one that perfectly matches your **guest count** and **budget** — without compromising on taste or quality

Our guests leave not just satisfied, but **delighted and talking about the food long after your event.**

🤝 **A Professional, Friendly Team That Cares**

When you book Shubham Halls, you don’t just get a venue — you get a **dedicated partner** :

• We help with planning, setup, and timelines.

• We coordinate catering, lighting, and sound — so you don’t need 5 different vendors.

• We stay with you until the last guest leaves, ensuring everything runs seamlessly.

📍 **Perfect Bay Area Location**

Centrally located in Sunnyvale, making it easy for your guests from San Jose, Cupertino, Mountain View, Fremont, and beyond. No long commutes, no stress — just convenience.

💡 **Our Philosophy**

We believe your milestone moments deserve **authentic care and zero compromises**. That’s why we:

❌ Don’t cut corners on food, décor, or service.

❌ Don’t inflate prices to discount later.

✅ Deliver **clear pricing, genuine hospitality, and no hidden fees.**

✨ **Peace of Mind, Every Step of the Way**

Our past guests say the same thing: they came in looking for a venue, and left with a **trusted partner who cared for their celebration as much as they did.** That’s the difference “Shubham” makes.

A Heartfelt Thank you !! 

We had our wedding at Shubham Halls, Grand Hall, and it was an amazing experience from start to finish. The team was very clear about pricing and services, explaining everything in detail upfront.  
The planning process was smooth, with great communication. The service was excellent, and the hall itself is fantastic—featuring a grand dance floor and a huge LED screen.Shubham Halls connected all the vendors, including the DJ and décor, making the whole experience seamless.Highly recommend it!

A Venue that truly cares and delivers on every promise

We had an exceptional experience hosting our daughter’s wedding at this venue. From start to finish, the management and staff were professional, respectful, highly responsive, and extremely prompt. They honored every contractual commitment and were flexible whenever possible, making the entire planning process smooth and stress-free.  
What truly stood out was their understanding of the pressure and emotions involved in a wedding. They ensured that every detail—venue setup, hall, chairs, tables, buffet arrangements, and food—was delivered exactly as agreed. The owners were always actively involved, closely monitoring everything to ensure the event’s success, which gave us great peace of mind.  
One of the most impressive and memorable gestures was when the owner, Arunji, personally ensured that the chef we had originally agreed upon was secured—even though the chef had already moved on. Thanks to Arunji for bringing back Chef Mani! The food was absolutely excellent, and even today our wedding guests continue to talk about how delicious it was. That says everything.  
A special shout-out to Manager Manoj for his coordination and support throughout. We are truly grateful to the entire team for making our daughter’s wedding such a beautiful and memorable celebration. Highly recommended without hesitation!

Our family wedding event at Shubham hall September 1st 2025

We held our son’s wedding at Shubham hall in Sunnyvale,CA on September 1st 2021. The event went very smoothly beyond our expectations. We had very good cooperation from the manager and their staff leading up to wedding and planning which included the decoration, table decoration, table arrangements, light arrangements, most importantly the food preparation by Shubham hall restaurant staff for breakfast and lunch South Indian style meals were enjoyed by all our guests. The facility has decent parking for the number of guests allowed in the hall. I would recommend Shubham hall if anyone considers having their family event.

Our Dream Wedding Came True!

We had the most wonderful wedding at Shubham Halls and can't recommend it enough! From the very start of our planning journey, the staff was incredibly helpful and supportive, making sure to accommodate all of our requests and making the process feel seamless.  
  
The venue itself is beautiful, with a large hall that felt both grand and intimate. Our guests had zero issues with parking, which was a huge plus. The absolute highlight for everyone, though, was the food — it was truly amazing! We received so many compliments on how delicious everything was. If you're looking for a venue that will help you create a perfect, stress-free day, this is the place.

5-Star Review for Shubham Halls- Highly recommend this place!!

I recently celebrated my milestone birthday at Shubham Halls, and I couldn't be more pleased with the entire experience! From the moment I started coordinating with Arun, I felt confident that my event was in great hands.   
  
Arun and his staff exhibited remarkable professionalism, ensuring everything was perfectly organized before and during the event. Their attention to detail was evident in every aspect, from the exquisite decorations to the top-notch quality of the food. Each dish was a delight, impressing all my guests.  
  
Communication was seamless, making the planning process smooth and stress-free. The care and effort the team put into making my celebration a grand success did not go unnoticed.  
  
I highly recommend Shubham Halls as a premier venue for any event. If you are considering a place for your next celebration, look no further! Thank you, Arun, Manoj and team, for making my special day unforgettable.

Best banquet ever!

We had a better than ever imagined Wedding Reception at Shubham Halls. Big shout out to Arun Ji for an absolutely gorgeous venue, amazing vibes and very friendly staff. Shubham halls became a favorite from the first step we took in the hall. The staff, the food, the amazing website and the best part is that they do all coordinations and setup for you so you don’t have to do any follow ups and you can just come and enjoy your day.   
A big shout out to Raman ji for the food. The food for any Indian ceremony is always the most sought after thing and at Shubham Halls the food was absolutely fantastic!  
From appetizers, to main course to dessert the taste was seriously unmatched!! You must add the fried rice to your menu.  
Absolutely highly recommended!

Upset.. I am giving them 2 stars for the service and professionalism 

I just had my mum’s 77th birthday and I was devastated with the service being provided. Firstly the hall was so hot, air conditioning was not working good or maybe the management was not keeping it to the desired temperature.   
I paid for server I was never provided with one. We had to call them multiple times if we needed anything.   
We brought food from home and it was not served. We had to ask For our food to be served. When they finally brought our food out most people already ate. I feel like we had so much left over and was not advised of such.   
Bottle soda was provided, no one brought jugs of soda to  
The tables. I am not satisfied with the service provided last nite. It was a very special day for my mum and all of us. I feel like there should be an event planner assigned for the parties. Disappointed and upset.
