We got married at the Museum on 8/10/19, we had our ceremony in the beautiful Mary Keane Chapel, cocktail hour outside the Stone Mill and reception inside the Stone Mill. We could not have picked a better place for our wedding! From the beginning we knew it was the perfect fit as it offered historical charm, multiple venues in one space, overnight accommodations, was reasonably priced and we were supporting a Museum and not just a wedding venue. Throughout the planning process the event coordinator, Anna, was beyond helpful. We were able to visit for measurements and to pick her brain whenever. She was always very organized and quick to reply in email or on the phone. The day before our wedding she helped organize a tour of the museum- a free perk if you book a room, which was a unique kick off to our wedding weekend. She was very flexible with us as we were doing a DIY wedding and allowed extended hours and access to the reception spot. During our wedding, especially the reception, she was the unsung hero. I heard from a few bridal party members after that she had picked up the pieces where things had fallen through, such as getting hot water for tea, etc. Without her the night wouldn’t have been as smooth. One of the best parts was having room for our family and bridal party to stay with us there, it let everyone really unwind and felt like a mini get away. The rooms were very spacious and made for great gathering places for getting ready and after the wedding! We were so lucky to have found this venue and to have had Anna help support us through the process! We highly recommend this venue to anyone and can’t wait to visit some of the other events they host there as well!

We toured this museum and met with Courtney, the venue coordinator, in March. We decided to book it for our wedding we originally planned to hold in June. When the COVID pandemic hit, we had to postpone. Courtney and the Currier staff were super helpful and patient during this unsettling time. Once things started opening back up, we moved forward with a new date in October, as we really wanted to have our wedding during a special exhibit. They were super flexible about our ever-changing event and working with us when our guest list shrunk almost by half. ALL of the staff during the event were amazing and super nice and helpful. Everyone worked with us to host a safe and socially distanced event. We had the best wedding and I am so happy we chose the Currier! Hopefully we can revisit each year to remember the experience. We can't recommend this venue enough!

Amazing venue. Created a memorable reception that many in attendance referred to as "the best wedding they've ever been to". Thanks!
