We wanted to order a light breakfast for a networking event, and Teleo was recommended to us by the director of Kirkwood's special business district. The team at Teleo was very responsive and accommodating, and our order was provided on time and as requested. My organization would definitely go to them for service in the future!

People were so happy with the food at our reception! Everything tasted amazing and the quantity of food per person was perfect. Pappy’s also did an awesome job accommodating guest allergies, almost everything served was gluten-free and we had several guests with allergies approach us to say how rare and appreciated that was. People also loved that the food came from a such a beloved local restaurant. We’d recommend Pappys for any wedding!

As the Mother of the Bride, I cannot recommend Ces & Judy’s catering enough. Our venue had a list of preferred food & beverage caterers. The bride and I spent a lot of time working through menus and asking for RFPs. There were some that I did not even hear back from. Ces & Judy’s were right on top of it and were accommodating to all of our questions. We are from Kansas City with the wedding in St. Louis so we really only had reviews to go on while choosing our caterer for this event. Then, we hired a Day of Coordinator and she confirmed that Ces & Judy’s has great food and a great staff and that she had worked with them many times. We booked them without even a tasting as neither of us could get to St. Louis prior to needing to get someone booked. What a phenomenal decision. From start to finish, Ces & Judy’s went out of their way to work through menus and options with us. I’ve never planned a wedding before so their expertise was greatly appreciated. They responded to all of my emails in a timely manner and always answered my questions in great detail. The food and beverage planning portion of the wedding was so easy with Ces & Judy’s. Where Ces & Judy’s really shine is in the day of service that they provide. Darla was our event manager and she took such good care of us starting just prior to the wedding day. She confirmed all of our choices and made sure that everything was on the list that we needed including linen counts, silverware and cake service items. We had provided a couple of names that had dietary restrictions and Darla made absolutely sure what they needed, their names and where they were going to be sitting was covered on her end. The evening of, she personally came over and made sure our waiter gave the correct dishes to the correct people. Darla had me send her the room layout and I also had a list of who was at which table, where at the table and which meal they had selected. I don’t know that everyone has this to provide but our dinner service was absolutely flawless as far as I could tell. You could see the care to detail that Darla provided leading up to the big day. The waiters were incredible and checked on us constantly. The bartenders were always on their toes and made the best drinks. Not too strong, not too weak and delicious. And the food. Wow. We did get to go to a tasting after we booked Ces & Judy’s officially but did a tasting for any last-minute changes. The food the day of was as great as or even better than the tasting. We served three appetizers at the cocktail hour, a full dinner (salad & main with a roll) and a late-night snack. I’ve heard so many complements about the quality of the food and the plating. Ces & Judy’s also helped serve the individual cakes that my daughter chose which I think is incredibly helpful. Everything we provided was returned clean and in great condition. If you are looking for a quality caterer for your wedding or an upcoming event, I encourage you to try Ces & Judy’s. I promise you will not be disappointed!

I have nothing but great things to say. The staff was so easy to work with. Brenna and Courtney met with me many times to ensure that every detail of my wedding day was exactly how I wanted it! They were so patient with me and had so many good recommendations for linens, glassware, how to set up the room, etc!! We had our reception at Piazza Messina, and I’m still in awe of how beautiful it was! The food is top notch and reasonably priced. We are still getting compliments on the menu. We recommend Russo’s to everyone we encounter that is planning some sort of party/ wedding!
