A Wedding Florist Who Nailed Our Style and Made It Easy!

They made our wedding flower dreams come true. The arrangements were absolutely beautiful and perfectly captured our style and vision. But what made them even more amazing was how flexible and easy they were to work with. They made the whole process a breeze, and we couldn't be happier with the outcome. Highly recommend them for their talent and stress-free approach!

My vision came to life! Bonnie is incredible !

Bonnie did an absolute incredible job on my flowers. I was not your typical white roses type of bride. I have a flower allergy and wanted a fresh citrus vibe. Bonnie came up with a list of non smelling flowers and created the most stunning pieces! I was truly blown away by her talent and so were my guests. She is so sweet, responded to us very quickly every time we had a question and her talent is unmatched by any other florist in Orange County.

Bonnie’s florals were everything I dreamed of!

I highly recommend doing florals through Bonnie! She has a beautiful artistic vision, but really listens to what you want. Her work incorporating succulents and more traditional flowers for my wedding was phenomenal.  
Thank you Bonnie for creating the most beautiful florals for our wedding! I appreciate you going above and beyond to get me my favorites (even when you were told they aren’t available). You created such stunning arrangements, bouquets, and other floral pieces (like my hair comb!) that made our wedding over the top amazing. Thank you!

Highly recommend

Bonnie and her team were absolutely amazing to work with. In terms of our experience, she flexible in our many design changes and accommodated our budget along the way. She was also great with communication throughout the planning process, knowledgeable about flowers (names, seasons, etc.), and extremely friendly! Most importantly, she went above and beyond our expectations the on the big day. Our flowers were the highlight of our event!   
  
Thank you Bonnie for being absolutely phenomenal across the board!

I cannot thank Bonnie enough for providing my amazing wedding florals. I live and work all around the country, so being out of town for most of my wedding planning was a bit challenging but working with Bonnie made my life easy and I was very happy. She was super responsive and helpful. I honestly was so indecisive and had no real idea of what I wanted floral wise...but Bonnie ended up nailing it! I got SO MANY compliments on everything, especially my flower crown and the wreath she made for our blue pittie who was also in our wedding. So thankful for all of her hard work and making everything look beautiful and come together. She had even stayed to help switch some florals around after the ceremony and set them up for some reception decor! She went above and beyond :) Highly recommend for anyone in the area needing florals!

Working with Bonnie was such a pleasure. It is always great to work with a hands on owner who truly cares. My daughter was married on 6/17 and Bonnie did all of the flowers. We could not have been happier. Many of our quests made a point to call me and tell me how beautiful the flowers were. I highly recommend The Tangled Vine!

Hands down the best florist EVER!!! Bonnie is the sweetest most compassionate person and did everything possible to make my wedding experience the best. took the time to make my husband and I feel comfortable before the wedding by explaining everything about the process, she also spent extra time make sure I got the exact color and look of flower that i had envisioned for my wedding. Her artistic eye and love for her work make her one in a million in world of flowers and desgin

My fiancé and I worked with Bonnie from the Tangled Vine for our October 2014 wedding. She was incredibly easy to work with and accommodating for our requests. Bonnie assured us she would work within our budget, while still maintaining the vision we had for our flowers. And she did deliver on those fronts! She helped me a lot in listening to my vision but filling in the blanks with her suggestions on details and flower options. I never had any issues communicating with Bonnie and she was very responsive via email. Bonnie was very creative and even sent us texts of pictures while she was putting our centerpieces together! We wanted to keep the centerpieces rather than renting out the boxes Bonnie was going to use for them, so Bonnie provided me with the vendors who sold those boxes. The flowers were probably one of the top two compliments we received from our wedding, including from my sometimes picky mother. She was a bit skeptical of our flower vision for the wedding. We received many compliments on using succulents, including the groomsmen boutonnieres that also had a golf tee attached (husband is a golfer). People were literally scrambling to take the centerpieces home at the end of the evening. Everyone wanted one! The centerpieces looked like mini gardens with the assortment of flowers, succulents and shades of purple. I loved how my bouquet looked and I also received many compliments on the style Bonnie created. Without any hesitation, I would recommend Bonnie to any engaged couples!

Our wedding was beautiful thanks to tangled vines. We did simple flowers for our rustic wedding (hydrangeas, stalk, roses, baby's breath) they looked beautiful and so elegant. We were on a budget and Bonnie was able to work with us . She has such a great eye for decor and flowers! She was able to put the flowers where they would look best and it just looked so beautiful. She did such a fantastic job! I would 100% reccomend her to everyone
