Giving a gift is a time-honored tradition that shows a person just how much you love and appreciate them—but that's not to say it's always easy. Need a little help on your hunt for the perfect stepmom gift? You've come to the right place. We've rounded up a whopping 25 gift ideas that'll give your stepmother all the feels. From sentimental keepsakes to luxe, pampering products, there's something on our list for everyone (and every occasion—her birthday, [Mother's Day](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/personalized-mothers-day-gifts), and the holidays included). 

But first, what makes a thoughtful gift for your stepmom? When it comes to buying a present for your stepmother (or [stepfather](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/stepdad-gifts), for that matter), what you choose should ultimately reflect your relationship. If you're very close with your stepmom or she helped to raise you, consider swinging for something sentimental, like a precious piece of jewelry. On the flipside, if you're not overly close with your stepmother or you're still getting to know her, it's totally acceptable to hand over a practical present (think: homeware or clothing). Just make sure you choose something you know she'll use.

Ready to get started? Check out our favorite gift ideas for stepmoms below. (_Psst_ , you can conveniently shop all of these picks online!)

## Snug Slippers

Gifts that encourage self-care will be appreciated at any time of year, whether you're shopping for holiday, birthday, or Mother's Day gifts for your stepmom. These ultra-cozy slippers are made from 100% Australian shearling that'll make her feel like she's walking on a cloud. 

**Quince** Australian shearling scuff slippers, $50, [Quince](https://www.quince.com/women/shearling-slide-slippers)

Sur la Table via Facebook

## Online Cooking Class

Buying a gift for the stepmom who loves to cook? Help her sharpen her skills in the kitchen by signing her up for an online cooking lesson. Sur la Table constantly has new classes on offer that reflect the season. Examples of classes include how to make pumpkin pie, mocha macarons (yum!), or even an Old Fashioned cocktail. The price of a lesson is per household, so you can even join in and make it a bonding experience. 

**Sur la Table** online cooking classes, from $29, [Sur la Table](https://www.surlatable.com/cooking-classes/online-cooking-classes/)

## Birth Flower Necklace

How about a nice necklace for your stepmom? These stunning pieces of jewelry represent the birth flowers for each month of the year, from January's carnation right through to December's narcissus. But don't be fooled by the name—birth flower necklaces aren't just for birthdays. It's a meaningful Mother's Day or Christmas gift for your stepmom too. All pendants are available in 18-karat gold-plated sterling silver, and some are also available in regular sterling silver. 

**Rellery** flower necklaces by birth month, from $115, [Rellery](https://rellery.com/collections/flower-power)

## DIY Knitting Kit

If your stepmom has been looking for a new hobby, encourage her to try her hand at knitting with this DIY kit. Each gift set includes six balls of yarn, knitting needles, a sewing needle, and the instructions to make a beautiful blanket. It's geared toward beginners, so your stepmother doesn't have to be a pro with the knitting needles just yet. 

**D.M.C.** The Quiet Time Blanket knitting kit, $35, [D.M.C.](https://www.dmc.com/US/en/products/the-quiet-time-blanket-knitting-kit)

## Beauty Advent Calendar

Wondering what to get your stepmother for Christmas? An early holiday present never hurt anyone. L'Occitane's Advent calendars are long-awaited every year, and for good reason. It's jam-packed with skincare goodies that have a total value of $115 (but you can nab the calendar for just $80!). The products included cater to a variety of skin types and concerns, including dryness, dullness, and fine lines. It's a great way to brighten your stepmom's day (and skin!) in the leadup to Christmas.

**L'Occitane** classic advent calendar, $80, [L'Occitane](https://www.loccitane.com/en-us/classic-advent-calendar-10CACLA23.html)

## Beautiful Dutch Oven

Like we said before, choosing a gift for your stepmother that reflects your relationship is a surefire way to her heart. If she taught you everything you know about cooking, honor all of those wonderful memories with some stylish new cookware. While Great Jones' signature Dutch oven (AKA [The Dutchess](https://greatjonesgoods.com/products/the-dutchess)) will forever be a staple, sometimes a 6-quart pot is just too big—that's where the Dutch Baby comes in. It has a volume of 3.5 quarts and stacks snugly inside its big sister.

**Great Jones** Dutch Baby, $120, [Great Jones](https://greatjonesgoods.com/products/dutch-baby)

## Meaningful Print

The best gifts for your stepmom certainly don't have to cost an arm and a leg. This affordable download provides a sweet definition of the word "stepmom" as "an ordinary person who has stepped up to raise a child to protect, provide, offer guidance and to be a friend." (Awwh!) Simply print it off at home, add a nice frame, and you're good to go. 

**Dictionary Print Store** stepmom definition gift, $6 for digital file, [Etsy](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&clickref=WWeditorial&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F625811573%2Fstepmom-gift-step-mom-gift-stepmom)

## Wine-Tasting Experience

If she likes to unwind with a tall glass of wine in hand, we've got the perfect gift. Vinebox delivers sample-size vials of delicious vino that makes wine-tasting at home easy peasy. This gift box contains nine impeccable wines in handy 100-milliliter bottles, from robust Spanish reds to crisp French whites. It's like a wine-tasting trip around Europe (minus the jet lag).

**Vinebox** Dinner Party, $99, [Vinebox](https://www.getvinebox.com/products/dinner-party)

## Fresh Flower Subscription

A bright bouquet of flowers is the crowning glory of any [beautifully decorated home](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/gifts-for-new-homeowners). Make sure your stepmom always has fresh blooms on display with a subscription to UrbanStems. The classic and seasonal plans both include a vase with the first delivery, while the luxe subscription includes a curated vase with every shipment. No matter which one you choose, it's a nice surprise for any occasion, whether you're looking for a birthday gift for your stepmother or shopping for the holidays.

**UrbanStems** subscription plan, from $55 per delivery, [UrbanStems](https://urbanstems.com/subscriptions)

## Engraved Chopping Board

Here's another thoughtful present for the stepmom who comes alive in the kitchen. This practical cherry wood chopping board isn't just great for preparing food, it's also a unique piece of serveware thanks to the rustic, personalized engraving. Trust us, she'll be itching to break out this bad boy the next time her friends come around. 

**Milk and Honey** **Luxuries** custom cutting board, $39, [Etsy](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&clickref=WWeditorial&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F271705150%2Fcustom-cutting-board-grandmas-kitchen)

## Stylish Pearl Earrings

There's something utterly timeless about [pearl jewelry](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/pearl-wedding-earrings), but these drop earrings offer a contemporary twist on the classic stone. We particularly love the idea of buying pearl jewelry for your stepmom because they're a symbol of wisdom—something she's likely given you a lot of over the years. The double-drop design makes these stunners really stand out. 

**Mejuri** bold pearl drop earrings, $98, [Mejuri](https://mejuri.com/shop/products/bold-pearl-drop-earring)

## Cute Coffee Mug

This playful mug is printed with the phrase: "Literally the best stepmom, like, ever." It's a lovely little token to gift your stepmother for Mother's Day or as a stocking stuffer for the holidays. Up the ante by including a packet of delicious coffee, hot chocolate, or another favorite beverage.

**Field Trip** Mother's Day gift for stepmom, $20, [Etsy](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&clickref=WWeditorial&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F510924520%2Fmothers-day-gift-for-stepmom-gift)

## Genius Planter

Got an avid gardener on your hands? Help her nurture her green thumb with a Farmstand from Lettuce Grow. This clever gadget makes growing her favorite plants easier than ever by self-watering and self-fertilizing. Plus, it uses 95% less water than traditional gardening—score! It comes in a variety of sizes and can be used indoors or outdoors, so you're bound to find one that suits her space. 

**Lettuce Grow** 24-plant Farmstand, from $521, [Lettuce Grow](https://www.lettucegrow.com/the-farmstand/)

## Sentimental Necklace

On the hunt for a meaningful wedding gift for your stepmother? She'll be grateful to receive this sweet infinity necklace featuring each of your initials. It comes in a sterling silver, rose gold, or gold-filled finish, and is complete with a heartfelt message on the packaging. It reads: "Not a stepmom, a bonus mom. I am forever grateful to have you in my life. Thank you for your unending love and support." Now that's what we call a sentimental gift idea for your "bonus mom."

**Reflection Of Memories** stepmom wedding gift, from 52, [Etsy](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=565019&clickref=WWeditorial&platform=dl&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F672568068%2Fbonus-mom-gift-step-mom-wedding-gift)

## Put-Together Sweatpants

Whether you're looking for holiday or birthday gift ideas for your stepmom, you can never go wrong with a nice item of clothing. If you're well-versed in her style and sizing, feel free to pick out something you know she'll love. If you're not sure, a [gift card](https://www.outdoorvoices.com/products/digital-gift-certificate?amount=25&variant=32723058720846) is your safest bet. That said, we're convinced almost anyone would be happy to receive these ridiculously comfy pants from Outdoor Voices. They're comfortable enough to wear on the go but have a more elevated style than traditional sweatpants.

**Outdoor Voices** RecTrek pant, $98, [Outdoor Voices](https://www.outdoorvoices.com/products/w-Rectrek-Pants?variant=32683627184206)

## Super-Soft Scarf

When it comes to holiday present ideas for your stepmom, a cashmere scarf is something that'll come in clutch for the rest of the winter (and all the winters to come). This warm and fuzzy accessory comes in four trendy colorways, meaning it'll look as good as it feels.

**Gentle Herd** rib knit wool-cashmere scarf, $75, [Gentle Herd](https://gentleherd.com/product/rib-knit-wool-cashmere-scarf/)

## Mini Massage Tool

We're still not over the Theragun, and we'll tell you why. The game-changing massage tool offers effective relief for tight and sore muscles right from the comfort of home. The Theragun Mini is arguably even more essential for anyone who's big into fitness. This nifty device is just as good at working sore muscles but comes in a smaller size for on-the-go therapy. It features three speed settings, 150 minutes of battery life, and the same surprisingly quiet motor as its big brother. 

**Therabody** Theragun mini, $199, [Therabody](https://theragun.xibx.net/e4E7O1)

## Scented Candle

We'll happily accept a scented candle as a gift any day, especially if it's one of the fresh fragrances from Otherland's Autumnland Collection. The collection includes six unique scents inspired by spending more time at home (and all of the unexpected wonders that come with it). You can gift the entire set, select a box of three scents, or opt for a single candle. 

**Otherland** Autumnland candle, $40 each, [Otherland](https://www.otherland.com/collections/homestead/products/homestead-collection)

## Dazzling Bracelet

If your stepmom is known for her glamorous sense of style, she'll appreciate this classic but eye-catching bracelet. It's studded with bezel-set Swarovski crystals that'll sparkle every time the light hits them. The rhodium-plated band creates a sleek finish.

**Swarovski** white rhodium-plated Emily bracelet, $125, [Swarovski](https://www.swarovski.com/en-US/p-M1808960/Emily-bracelet-White-Rhodium-plated/?variantID=1808960)

## Personalized Stationery

Writing thank-you notes will no longer be a bore with a set of beautiful personalized cards to work with. This design features an illustration of pretty pressed flowers and will come printed with her full name following the words: "From the desk of." If it's a birthday or Christmas gift for your stepmother, she can put them to use right away, sending thank-you notes for all of the other presents and cards she received.

**Papier** Pressed Florals notecard set, from $66 for a set of 20, [Papier](https://www.papier.com/us/pressed-florals-37183)

## Gourmet Coffee Subscription

Does your stepmom start every day with a hot cup of joe? If so, upgrade her morning coffee routine with a subscription to Atlas Coffee Club. Each month, she'll receive different blends from all over the world alongside a postcard, flavor notes, and brewing tips. It's an ongoing coffee-tasting experience delivered right to her door.

**Atlas Coffee Club** gift subscription, from $9 per shipment, [Atlas Coffee Club](https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-11887-88550-169122?sid=WWeditorial&url=https%3A%2F%2Fatlascoffeeclub.com%2F)

## Custom Family Portrait

A custom painting of your beautiful blended family might just make her tear up when she opens it. The artists at Paint Your Life can recreate a photograph of you and your loved ones in an oil painting with the simple stroke of a brush—impressive, we know.

**Paint Your Life** oil family painting, from $199, [Paint Your Life](https://www.paintyourlife.com/family-portraits-gallery.php)

## Embroidered Weekend Bag

Who doesn't love a mini break? Now that travel is back in the cards, spoil your stepmother with a brand new bag she can take with her on all of her weekend trips. This stylish light pink option can be personalized with her monogram or name in pretty cursive script for an extra-special touch.

**WeddingWire Shop** custom embroidered faux leather weekend bag, $70, [WeddingWire Shop](https://www.weddingwireshop.com/product/womens-custom-embroidered-faux-leather-weekender-travel-bag-light-pink?utm_source=weddingwire&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=gifts-for-stepmom&utm_campaign=wweditorial)

## Cozy Robe

Here's another fitting Mother's Day gift idea for your stepmom: a plush bath robe. This ultra-soft option is made from 100% Turkish cotton and comes in white, smoke, or graphite, as well as a selection of limited edition colors. It's the perfect way to let her know she deserves some downtime. 

**Brooklinen** super-plush robe, $99, [Brooklinen](https://www.brooklinen.com/products/super-plush-robe)

## Decorative Recipe Tin

A stylish recipe tin is a good gift for any stepmom who loves coming up with their own creations in the kitchen. It'll be home to all of her best recipes, whether she's a budding home chef or prefers baking desserts. Bonus: The pretty floral design means it'll look great on the countertop. Pick up a set of [matching recipe cards](https://riflepaperco.com/citrus-floral-recipe-cards) to complete your present. 

**Rifle Paper Co.** Citrus Floral recipe tin, $36, [Rifle Paper Co.](https://riflepaperco.com/citrus-floral-recipe-tin)
