It was great to be able to bring in almost any vendor and our own alcohol. The venue was classy enough that we barely had to decorate. Even after we booked it, they were updating things. There is no much offered in the kitchen and you need to bring everything besides tables and chairs. There is a staff person on site and they were super helpful with anything we needed.

I was so happy I selected Commodore Cruises for my very small wedding ceremony and dinner celebration. Victoria was professional, responsive and attentive to all the small details throughout the planning and event day. Food selection, preparation and presentation were high end and delicious. Cake was amazing and gluten free! Wait service and bartender onboard the ship were personable and such a pleasure to spend the evening with. Highly recommended selecting Commodore Cruises for a unique and intimate wedding event!
