Update

Average Photography cost $2,000 Lower range $300 or less Upper range $4,500 or more Most couples spend between $1,150 - $3,000

Costs displayed in graph are based on spend from thousands of couples who recently reported pricing for this service within their WeddingWire review. Pricing varies based on factors including, but not limited to, vendor’s experience, level of expertise, event guest count, date, and geographic region.

## How much does a wedding photographer cost?

Wedding photographer prices can vary depending on many factors including your wedding’s location (photographers in big cities tend to cost more than in other areas), the type of services and packages you’re looking for, and your chosen photographer’s experience and level of expertise. In general, wedding photographer prices in the U.S. tend to range between $1,150 and $3,000, with the average wedding photographer cost hovering around $2,000.

## What's covered in a wedding photographer’s prices?

When researching wedding photographers, be sure to read the [information about their pricing and packages](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/why-a-wedding-photographer-costs-that-much) carefully—these tend to differ widely from photographer to photographer and can greatly affect wedding photography pricing. A few items and services to look for include:

  * Time: Wedding photographer prices typically include between six hours and an unlimited amount of coverage. The more time you’d like your photographer to cover your event, the more you’ll have to pay. Additional hours will cost extra.
  * Travel: Does your photographer have to travel a long distance to your event? You may have to pay a per-mile charge if he or she is driving to your wedding, or you might have to pay for airfare and accommodations for a destination wedding. 
  * Second Shooters/Staffing: Will your photographer have a second shooter or assistants present? If so, expect to shell out more.
  * Editing: A large part of your photographer’s time will be spent editing and retouching your wedding photos to make sure they look absolutely amazing.
  * Images: Your wedding photographer’s cost should include the actual images. Digital files can be provided to you in a variety of ways including in an online gallery and/or via a USB drive.
  * Print release: Many wedding photography packages include a “print release,” which means that you can use the photos for your own personal use. However, be aware that you will likely not have a full “copyright release,” so you don’t own the photos and can’t sell them, and that your photographer can use your photos for marketing purposes. 
  * Prints: Some photographers include photo prints (or a print credit—money you can put toward purchasing prints) in their wedding photography rates. While you don’t have to purchase your prints through your photographer, they’ll likely come out better if you do.
  * Albums: Your photographer may offer a [wedding album](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-create-the-perfect-wedding-album) as part of his or her package. You can choose whether you’d like to design and purchase your album through your photographer or do it through another service.
  * Additional shoots: Some photographers [include an engagement shoot](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/engagement-photo-shoot-tips-and-ideas) in their package (62 percent of couples do a pre-wedding engagement shoot). Other shoots that will likely cost extra include bridal portraits, trash the dress sessions, or coverage of your rehearsal dinner.



There are other, less obvious parts of a wedding photographer’s business that may be included in their package pricing, which include equipment, employees, business expenses, marketing, liability insurance, and more. 

## Do I need to tip my wedding photographer?

While tips aren’t included in a photographer’s package, they are certainly something you should factor into your wedding photography budget. We recommend tipping your wedding photographer between $100 to $200. You should also write an [online review for your photographer](https://www.weddingwire.com/shared/rate?formEntryPoint=40) as an added thank-you.

## When should you hire a wedding photographer?

Wedding photographers are usually among the first vendors couples book after they secure their venue. We recommend starting the search for your photographer [about 11 months before your big day](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-checklists.html).

## What are the different wedding photography styles?

As you [start researching wedding photographers](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/5-ways-to-research-a-wedding-photographer-after-their-site) by checking out their work and [reading their online reviews](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photographers), be sure to pinpoint the wedding photography style you like best. There are a few [wedding photography styles](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-photography-styles-you-should-know) to choose from, including:

  * Photojournalism: This wedding photography style is all about telling a story. The photographer will capture candid, emotional moments as opposed to posed portraits.
  * Traditional: A more formal, classic photography style, traditional wedding photography includes lots of posed shots. 
  * Fine Art: This style is all about dramatic compositions and stylized images. It’s a more modern approach that creates frame-worthy images.
  * Fashion: If you want images that focus on your attire and look like they belong in a magazine, this is the wedding photography style for you. Think creative backdrops and unique poses.
  * Vintage: This photography style uses filters and other techniques to give your wedding photos an old-school feel.



## Should I get a second shooter for my wedding?

When it comes to the great “one versus two wedding photographers” debate, the “right” answer tends to vary from photographer to photographer, and often depends on the size of your wedding. If you’re having a very intimate and small wedding, having just one photographer present may suffice. However, if you’re hosting a larger wedding with lots of guests, you will likely need a main photographer as well as a second photographer, and perhaps assistants to help with lighting and coordination. 34 percent of wedding photographers include a second shooter in their starting rates, but for many, it's a separate charge. 

Having a second shooter can be beneficial in capturing different perspectives and angles throughout the day—and can make your wedding-day timeline run even more smoothly. With two photographers on hand, both your and your future spouse’s getting-ready processes can be photographed at the same time. It’s best to discuss your specific wedding and needs with your photographer to determine the best staffing situation.

## Are albums included in a wedding photographer's prices?

Many photographers do include an album in their wedding photography rates. However, some photographers offer it as a separate line item, which can add several hundred dollars to your total. There are indeed other services that allow you to create your own wedding photo album, but it can sometimes be more seamless to go through your own photographer.

## Do I have to cover my wedding photographer's travel costs?

If your wedding photographer is based near your wedding location, you likely won’t have to pay any additional travel costs. However, if your photographer will be traveling a significant distance (often over 60 miles), you will likely incur additional travel costs, up to $2 per mile or more. If your photographer is flying to your wedding destination, you will probably have to pay for his/her airfare and accommodations, as well as an additional travel fee. Again, these wedding photographer prices vary from pro to pro, so be sure to ask your chosen photographer for pricing details before booking.

## Do I have to pay for my wedding photographer's meals? 

For your wedding vendors who will be present during your actual wedding (your photographer, videographer, DJ, wedding planner, etc.) you will need to provide hot meals. Yes, this is indeed an [added expense that you might not have expected to incur](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/hidden-costs-that-can-wreck-your-wedding-budget), but it’s an important one—vendors who are well-fed and happy will better be able to bring their A-game for your big day! Your wedding caterer is likely accustomed to providing these vendor meals, so be sure to discuss this with them.

## How much do engagement photos cost?

We definitely think doing an engagement shoot is worth it, as it helps you and your partner get comfortable in front of the camera and with your photographer before your big day. Oftentimes [engagement photo sessions](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/the-art-of-a-great-engagement-shoot) are included in a with the cost of wedding photographers. However, some photographers list these shoots separately, and engagement shoot prices can range from $150 to over $600 for a session. These prices usually include a shoot at a location of your choice and an online gallery and/or USB of images. Some photographers allow you to make [multiple outfit changes](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/what-to-wear-to-an-engagement-shoot) during your shoot, though that may cost extra for others.

## When should you take your engagement photos?

Couples usually take engagement photos about three months before their wedding date. You should work with your photographer to determine the best time for your needs. Some couples will adjust their timing to have a warm-weather engagement shoot, but don’t shy away from a winter photo session. We find winter engagement shoots to be among the most intimate, cozy and romantic! 

## How much does it cost to hire a videographer for a wedding? 

Wedding photographers and videographers often work in tandem throughout your wedding day to fully capture all of the amazing moments. On average, a wedding videographer in the U.S. costs about $1,799 with most couples spending between $1,000 to $2,500, though, as with photographers, there are many factors that contribute to a [wedding videographer’s cost](/cost/wedding-videographer).

## What are the important questions to ask a photographer before booking?

When meeting with a photographer for the first time, there are [several questions you should be sure to ask](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/14-questions-to-ask-a-wedding-photographer) pros before booking, including:

  * How would you describe your style?
  * Can I see a full album from a wedding?
  * Have you ever shot a wedding in my venue before?
  * How much are your packages and what do they include?
  * What happens if an emergency comes up and you can’t be present on my wedding day?
  * When and how will I receive my images?
  * How can my family members and friends order prints?
  * How many weddings do you photograph in a year?
  * What do you enjoy most about photographing weddings
  * Can I see a contract?
