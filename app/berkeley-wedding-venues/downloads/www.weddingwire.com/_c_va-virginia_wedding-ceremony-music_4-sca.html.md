Anna and Dave are first-class musicians and incredibly easy to work with. Anna and Dave provided the ceremony and cocktail hour music for our big day - the music was flawless and guests couldn't stop telling us how great it was to listen to Duo Boheme. Anna was super responsive in the build up to the wedding, and dealt with a last minute request with the upmost professionalism. I hope we are guests at a future wedding where Duo Boheme is performing so we can sit back and appreciate their music again! Best, Rob and Anne Marie

Ibis Music Group also brought Bridgerton energy to the cocktail hour, and it was incredible! It was one of the highlights of the entire day, and guests could not stop talking about it! They are truly an incredible group of musicians!

Ross was great to work with. Very professional and flexible. We forgot to pick a song for the groom to walk down to, but Ross noticed my husbands love of Batman and offered to play the Batman theme song when he walked down the aisle. We ( and our guests) loved it!!!

Kevin and Adam did an amazing job performing for our wedding ceremony and cocktail reception. Not only did they play all of the songs we requested from their catalog, but they also played at least two other songs that we requested that weren't in their catalog--and they played them beautiful. Their music contributed to the specialness of the day, and re-listening to it for years to come on video will be a cherished memory of ours! Highly recommend!

We cannot recommend Melodious Strings enough! They were professional, punctual, and played beautifully throughout our ceremony. I was so impressed by their willingness to learn a specific song for my walk down the aisle, it made the moment feel so personal and unique. The song selection process was seamless, and we received so many compliments from our guests on how lovely the music was. A truly talented group that we would recommend to any couple!

Having the string quartet at our wedding was a dream come true! My husband and I chose songs from their expansive repertoire for the ceremony, and Allegra put together the perfect program for our cocktail hour. Allegra was very responsive and easy to work with. We couldn’t be happier!

Jennifer Johnson and a cellist played for my daughters wedding. Jennifer was so wonderful to work with, very professional and quick to respond to my many questions. She was able to ease a Mother-of-the-Bride's worries! They were punctual and the music was absolutely beautiful. Really made the ceremony just perfect!! Sally Johann Richmond, VA

Tara did an absolutely wonderful job. She was communicative and helpful. I had a special piece that I wanted my father to walk me down the aisle to, and she carried it off perfectly! It was a beautiful moment that I will remember for the rest of my life. Thank you!
