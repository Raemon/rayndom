## Wedding details

I'm an original May 2020 bride, after 4 postponements because of the pandemic we eloped with just our sons. I became a 2021 bride, but still it was just he and I and a few people over Zoom. The best part is marrying him over and over again is that he's Him. Now, we may try for our anniversary next year to pull people together - that's the idea. A giant happy party to celebrate all the wonderful things that have happened since we began this adventure!
