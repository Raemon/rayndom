The Apollo on Emma offers a beautiful flexible space that was so easy to decorate and personalize. We had a medium size wedding with the ceremony outside in the pavilion and then joined our guests inside for the reception. There was plenty of room for guests to dine and visit as well as dance. Heidi Faires is the easiest person to work with and will help make your vision come true.

I just cannot say enough good things about this venue. From the moment we took a tour we knew it was the perfect venue for us. They provided everything we needed for our wedding and reception. Amy & her staff took such great care of us that we truly had nothing to worry about. You could really tell that they loved their jobs and loved this beautiful historic mansion, and that made such a difference. If you are shopping around for a wedding venue, I would suggest starting here first! Especially if you are on a budget, they were by far the most responsibly priced venue around!
