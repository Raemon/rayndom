We booked Platinum's 38 passenger bus for our wedding and WOW we could not have been more pleased. Not only is the bus the nicest party bus I've seen (and well kept) but the service, especially by our driver Jim, could not have been any better!

we had two separate drivers, for two portions of our wedding day. both were on time, professional, and very flexible. I HIGHLY recommend their services, as well as having a point person to contact the drivers throughout the night, because you will NOT have eyes on your phone!

We booked Douglas Claw Luxury for our wedding getaway car and it was honestly perfect. The Escalade looked amazing in our photos and felt so clean and comfortable after a long day. We ended up loving it so much that we actually extended our rental after the wedding just to keep using it. Christian was super easy to work with, communicated quickly, and made the whole process stress free. If you’re looking for a luxury rental or a wedding getaway car, I would totally recommend them. It was such a fun part of our wedding weekend!

Tony and Party Bus Rock were amazing! First off, this was one of the nicest party buses we looked at- and not the most expensive. It has some built-in coolers and an AUX cord to plug in an ipod/iphone. The max capacity was 21 and everyone fit well (not too crowded). Tony was super easy to work with and very accommodating! I sent him an itinerary beforehand and he was on top of it. Couldn't have asked for a better experience. Would highly recommend! Heck, I might even book him again for a night out on the town with friends!

Vandalia Bus Lines was wonderful to work with. The driver showed up early and was very nice and accommodating getting the bridal party from place to place. I would 100% recommend their services.

STLParty Bus was the perfect choice for our wedding (April 30, 2022). They were easy to reach and extremely accommodating when a few weeks out I needed to add time to my reservation. Our driver, Fred, was on-time, super polite, and kind. He navigated pick-ups and drop-offs and a busy Forest Park during prom season without any issue. We had a 28-passenger bus but only ended up with 11 people, we possibly could have gone down a size but having the extra room for dresses and coolers was very nice. The bus was fun and clean and the temperature was great. I would recommend STLParty bus to anyone who needed transportation for an event!

Karen was our driver and she was phenomenal!! She welcomed us all aboard and even brought out a small cooler of waters while we were getting pictures! It was a hot day, and she made sure we were all comfortable! Thank you for getting us from location to location safely and providing such a fun atmosphere!!!
