I had the pleasure of having Mike Megaro as the DJ for my wedding, and I couldn't be happier with his exceptional professionalism and kindness. From start to finish, Mike demonstrated his expertise in curating the perfect DJ set that kept everyone on the dance floor throughout the night. Mike's friendly and approachable nature made working with him a breeze, and his commitment to delivering top-notch sound quality was evident. I highly recommend Mike Megaro as a talented and kind DJ who will make your special event truly unforgettable.

DJ Mauro is everything you want in a wedding DJ and more. My wife Jessie and I came to Italy from the United States for our dream wedding in Tuscany and Mauro played a big part in the day being perfection! From the moment we met him on a Zoom call, we knew he was the DJ for us. He was extremely accommodating to our requests and his energy and passion took the party to the next level. If you are looking for someone who can make your special day even more perfect, Mauro is your man! Jessie and I would hire Mauro again in a heartbeat if we had to all over again.

We honestly cannot recommend Musicology Wedding Entertainment Professionals in Italy enough. From our very first conversation, Manuel made us feel confident, supported, and excited about our wedding day. He recommended their hybrid DJ band, featuring saxophone, drums, violin, and DJ and to top it all off, he even sings! The music was incredible and kept the energy high all day and night. But what truly sets Musicology apart is that they are so much more than entertainment. Manuel flawlessly ran the entire day as an MC, guiding every moment with perfect timing, warmth, and professionalism. From the ceremony through cocktails, dinner, and party, everything flowed seamlessly thanks to his coordination. They also helped us plan the entire day, offering invaluable advice and handling details we didn’t even realize we needed. On top of that, they connected us with amazing vendors, including our photographer, videographer, photo booth, string quartet for the ceremony, and many other elements that made our wedding unforgettable. Even now, our guests keep telling us how incredible the music and overall experience were. Months later, people are still talking about how fun, elegant, and perfectly organized everything felt. Choosing Musicology was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. If you’re looking for professionals who truly care, elevate your event, and make your day stress-free and unforgettable, this guys are top! We are forever grateful!

As Sofia, writing with a heart full of gratitude, I can truly say that our DJ Julian from Elite Events made our wedding day at Villa Pizzi unforgettable. He was attentive to every detail, perfectly in tune with each moment, and his vinyl setup added a touch of charm and authenticity that everyone adored — from our Italian guests to those who joined us from the United States. With my Italian elegance and Jack’s Florida spirit, Julian created a musical bridge between our two worlds, becoming an essential part of the magic of our celebration. An exceptional professional who transforms music into pure emotion. Highly recommended!
