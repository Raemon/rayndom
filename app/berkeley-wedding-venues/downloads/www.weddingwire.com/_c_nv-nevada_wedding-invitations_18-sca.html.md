We hired Jessica to do our wedding invitations and are so glad we did! I always knew I wanted to work with a professional on our wedding invites, but I didn't want to pay insane amounts of money for custom invitations. Jessica had a really great customizable template on her website that gave us the best of both worlds! We were able to work with Jessica to make some tweaks to the template at a very reasonable price. Jessica was extremely flexible and was very patient each time I requested minor changes. She even mailed me a few samples so I could see them in-person, free of charge! The day before the wedding when I realized I didn't have a spare envelope for our photographer to use for a Details photo, Jessica even offered to overnight one to us. We got so many compliments on our beautiful invites, all thanks to Jessica's design work! We would highly recommend Jessica for your invitation needs.

Danielle was AMAZING!!!! Everything she produced was incredible. She was really easy to work with. I'd call her with an idea and she and I would build on it. Then, VERY SOON, I'd have an e-mail with exactly what I was envisioning. Sometimes even better than I'd imagined! Here is the list of things she designed for me... Bridal Shower Thank You Cards Bachelorette Party Thank You Cards Wrap-around Labels for STDs Wrap-around Labels for Invitations Wrap-around Labels for Thank Yous Labels for Wedding Thank Yous Return Labels for Wedding Thank Yous Seating Chart Photo Sharing Cards She worked well with my printer and even dealt with my perfectionist attitiude, not complaining when I'd ask her to change the smallest detail. I received MANY compliments on all of the paper products and small details of the wedding. Danielle had designed a good number of those. She was really fabulous. Totally the best ever!

Kristin did a great job on our wedding invitations! I gave her a concept of what I wanted and everything turned out even more creative than I could imagine! And her Prices are the best around! You get a custom invitation, no cookie cutter design! She also did my bridal shower invites/favors (super cute wine charms and labels) and did such a great job! I will use her for everything I can in the future! I also had Kristin last minute make my Reception table card as well as the cards for the seating chart and a few other things, and they came out absolutely gorgeous! Thanks again for everything!
