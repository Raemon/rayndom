Hometown Wedding Dreams

Our wedding day was everything we dreamed of and it went off without a hitch thanks to Jenelle and the entire crew at DBGCC! Discovery Bay is my hometown and my parents are members of the club, so it meant a lot to host our wedding in a location that had a sentimental value. I did a lot of venue research and you truly cannot find another venue that is so open and friendly to making a wedding day vision come to life. I consider myself very lucky for already having a special connection with the location. Our guests have continuously shared how much they enjoyed our wedding, from the atmosphere to the great food, and now looking back myself I couldn't imagine our wedding day being hosted anywhere else. I was my own wedding planner, so I am so grateful I had Jenelle as my day-of coordinator. Thanks again Jenelle & DBGCC!

She made sure everything was in order and taken care of and everything just came out so perfect . She is literally the sweetest person ever.

My husband and I were married at Discovery Bay Country Club on October 15, 2016, and I have to admit booking our venue at DBCC was the best and smartest decision we made during our wedding planning process.   
  
The venue itself is absolutely beautiful, the course was a stunning backdrop to our photos and during dinner the dimmed lighting interior was absolutely gorgeous and gave such a romantic vibe.   
  
However, what made our experience definitely one to remember was the service that Jenelle and her staff provided. From the very beginning when we first toured DBCC, we were blown away with how Jenelle presented the venue. She painted the picture of exactly how we would envision our special day. And she did not let us down. She was extremely helpful with recommending great vendors and was always helpful with answering my many many questions.  
  
When the day of our wedding finally approached, the entire staff was amazing! They made sure everything ran smoothly and that everyone was catered to. And I have to add the food was exquisite! Till this day we still have guest complimenting how beautiful, organized, tasty and great our wedding was.  
  
Thank you again, Discovery Bay Country Club for such an amazing and unforgettable experience!

I cannot say enough about how happy I am that we chose this vendor to have our wedding. The grass area for the wedding ceremony & where the reception was held inside was gorgeous & clean. The food was amazing & the entire staff did everything they could to accommodate our needs & requests every time we visited prior to the wedding & on the day of . Janelle was who we worked with mostly & she was extremely pleasant & professional. The wedding day itself went off without a hitch & that was due to Janelle keeping everyone focused & on schedule. I highly recommend having your special day at the Discovery Bay Country Club.

We had our wedding at the Discovery Bay Country Club on 9/10/16. In researching different venues, we knew once we arrived at DBCC that this venue was the one! Not only was the staff super friendly and accommodating but the venue itself was beautiful, inside and out! With that we found we had to do very minimal decorating. We didn’t want to take away from the lovely architecture. Jenelle and her staff were amazing! Every question I had was answered, they responded in a timely matter and were also kind enough to let us use items for the wedding, such as the glass center pieces or easels. They welcomed us to come take a look at the venue anytime we wanted for planning purpose and ideas. The day off, Jenelle kept everyone in order in a professional and also fun matter. She knew what she was doing, showed us the best spots to take pictures and kept me calm right before walking down the aisle. Her staff was super sweet and catered to anything we needed. My guests had nothing but nice things to say about the DBCC staff and venue: “beautiful wedding, beautiful venue, yummy food, your coordinator was on top of it!”  
Thank you Jenelle, you and your staff, for helping us make our dream wedding come true. Kevin and I couldn’t be happier with how our wedding day played out! It is definitely a day we will never forget and in part because of you and your team!

Discovery Bay Country Club was absolutely AMAZING for our wedding in October. The grounds are breathtaking especially for the perfect wedding photos, the food was delicious, and your guests will enjoy beautiful views of the golf course and ponds as they dine and enjoy your ceremony. I highly recommend taking a tour and at least checking it out so that you can see why we fell in love with it and knew it would be the perfect place to get married. I also cannot begin to tell you how wonderful their service is and how they will go out of their way to make your day special. Jenelle is who will coordinate everything for you and she's very nice and very helpful.

We came to this venue after I had checked it out online and knew that this was the venue we wanted to use from the moment walking in. We loved the openness with the tall ceilings and wall sized windows of the dining room and dance floor which was lacking in other venues we previously looked at. We met with Jenelle who gave us a tour of the facility and showed us their two ceremony sites and gave us a rundown of their services. Our parents later joined us to see the site on a later date and we sealed the deal. Jenelle is absolutely the best! She was very professional and helpful from the start! My dad was of course very excited about the wedding but was a bit of a "dad-zilla" at times, Jenelle helped to keep the focus on us as the couple while being accommodating of both of our families desires. She helped to keep me on track with the planning process and was quick to respond to any questions I had. The day of our wedding everything went VERY smoothly! The only "problem" that we had was that a gust of wind almost knocked over our ceremony arch while the guests were being seated but Jenelle was in the right place at the right time and caught it before it could hit the ground and got it secured right away with no issue during the ceremony! I only knew about this because our guests let me know and were impressed at how efficiently it was addressed. We've gotten nothing but praise about the food that was served, the wait staff, the venue itself and the overall flow of the day. I recommend this venue 100% and would feel confident with any event Jenelle helps with to make sure the couple is happy and that their day runs seamlessly.
