Kara - event coordinator 

I was lucky to work with Kara who was the wedding coordinator for me and my husband. Kara went above and beyond to make the day special! She was professional and organized with scheduling meetings with us so that she could understand our vision for the wedding. She coordinated with the vendors for proper delivery and set up of flowers, desserts, and sound system for the DJ, and she set up the reception hall with the place settings, center pieces and flowers. Still in awe at how she was able to do so much as one person! She took so much off of my plate, making for a stress free wedding that I was able to enjoy! Her calm demeanor and understanding nature were also so helpful in keeping me at ease, because I was able to trust that she would keep everything on pace. I would recommend Kara as a wedding coordinator for any bride looking to lighten their load with the wedding planning process!

Amazing people to work with

She was very attentive and helped our special day go on without a single problem. Even when problems arose behind the scenes she solved it long before it got to us. Would definitely use their service again. Also a very pleasant and easy to talk to person.

Highly recommend working with Kara!

Kara was our wedding coordinator for our October 2025 wedding, and from the very beginning, she was an absolute dream to work with. She is the perfect balance of professional, organized, and genuinely caring, exactly what every bride hopes for when planning such an important day.  
  
Throughout the entire planning process, Kara provided thoughtful guidance, seamless communication, and impeccable attention to detail. She offered incredible recommendations and unwavering support, always making me feel fully taken care of. I never once felt hesitant to reach out with questions or concerns, she was consistently responsive, reassuring, and steps ahead at all times.  
  
On our wedding day, everything flowed effortlessly. Kara ensured the timeline ran beautifully, creating a calm, stress-free experience from start to finish. Even when an unexpected storm threatened our fireworks, she handled the situation with grace and confidence. She swiftly adjusting plans so we could still enjoy the moment without any added stress. Her calm presence made all the difference.  
  
Kara truly went above and beyond for us, and I cannot say enough wonderful things about her. You will be in exceptional hands from start to finish. If you are looking for a coordinator who delivers elegance, precision, and peace of mind, I highly recommend Kara to help bring your perfect day to life. ♥️

Camellia Co. over delivered... Exceptional experience from start to finish! 

Camellia Co. provided my husband and I with the peace of mind we were hoping for in a planner. Kara was there for us from the start and not only was she a pleasure to work with, but is one of the most detail oriented young professionals I've ever had the pleasure to work with. In my professional life I have to be the big decision maker and that was the last thing I wanted to do for our wedding. From vendor communications, scheduling tastings with our catering team, and all throughout the day of our wedding Kara and her husband provided us with an unforgettable experience. We love you Kara! Thank you for taking such good care of my us!!!

Going with Kara was absolutely the right choice for my wife and I!

Kara was an exceptional wedding planner... She helped make our day unforgettable! I was a mess during the planning process and at every turn Kara was there to help lead us through all of our concerns. I'd especially like to shout out how she helped keep my family focused during our rehearsal ceremony... we were all just so excited that night! 10/10 would book again!

We LOVED working with Kara and her team!

First of all, let me say that this young woman is a powerhouse! She was absolutely ready to go every step of the way. From the start of our planning process to the end of our actual wedding, we entrusted Kara to handle the logistics of our wedding day and she did not disappoint. As second timers, my wife and I really just wanted to focus on having the best day possible, celebrating with family, and enjoying the start of this next chapter together. She was professional, creative, and a real joy to work with! Going with her was one of the best decisions we made during our wedding.

Best decision we made during our planning process :)

I've known Kara for years and when my fiancé proposed to me I didn't even think twice about who would be my coordinator, of course I went with her! She has the perfect personality for event planning and a creative vision to help bring any event to life. Her ability to coordinate with all of our other vendors during the lead up to our big day took so much stress off of my shoulders. My bridesmaids and in-laws couldn't stop commenting about how organized she was... that's my girl! You'd be a fool to not consider her if you're in or around the western suburbs!

If you're looking for full service planning, look no further!!

We feel SO lucky to have found Kara and her event company! After our initial consultation, my partner and I opted to go with her full planning package for our wedding. Excellent communicator, fabulous style, and by far our most attentive vendor... please do yourself a favor and book her! You can't go wrong with Camellia Co. Events!
