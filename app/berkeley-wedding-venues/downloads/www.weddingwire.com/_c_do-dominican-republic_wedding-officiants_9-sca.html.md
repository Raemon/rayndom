I am so glad we had Jehison, he is the best of the best MC & officiant. He did way more of what we expected. The ceremony was my favorite on how unique and intimate he made it for us. You can tell he loves what he does. It was an unforgettable magical experience. Thank you so much!

Miguel was absolutely amazing. He made it a priority to coordinate a time to meet with us in advance to introduce himself, express our expectations, share the verbiage he’d read at our ceremony to ensure we were comfortable with it, and even asked us if we have any questions or concerns. Miguel is such a genuine soul and we are so excited to have him be apart of our big day!! We highly recommend his services and presence to those looking!

jl minister was our choice for our ceremony in May, the communication was very good, their advice on our wedding reading was very good, they added a touch of joy to the writing and some friends told me that they are the first to perform symbolic ceremonies in Punta Cana
