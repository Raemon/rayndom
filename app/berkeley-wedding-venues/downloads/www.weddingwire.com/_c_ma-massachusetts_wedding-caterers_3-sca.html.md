We got a plated dinner (salmon, filet mignon, chicken florentine, or a veggie stack) for 47 people (plus vendors) along with appetizers and dessert. Their food is phenomenal and to my knowledge they were able to accommodate all our guest's allergies and diets. We adored everything they cooked and happily stuffed our faces (and as far as we could tell, our guests did too). I would trade my firstborn for their salmon recipe. Also they have these little crostinis that I highly recommend; one of ours was beef with horseradish cream on a little piece of toasted bread...I think I ate at least six of those I kid you not.

We got married September 2025 and had East Meets West as our catering team. We cannot say enough good things about how amazing they were! We highly recommend! From our initial meeting, tasting menu, countless messages/phone calls throughout the planning process, all the way through to the amazing service and incredible food the day of our wedding, we were so impressed! The chef was able to blend themes from my husband's Dominican background into our food choices for the day and it all turned out delicious. Our guests are still saying it was the best food they’ve ever had at a wedding. Catherine served as our wedding planner guiding us through every last detail including our menu, place setting selection, and details for the day of. She and the chef ensured all the food came out hot even when our speeches went longer than anticipated. The waitstaff and bartenders were extremely professional and provided top class service. They were also all so fun once the party started handing out desserts on the dance floor and keeping us all with drinks in hand. Overall, we could not be happier with EMW and our wedding day was seamless due to their incredible work and planning. BOOK THEM! They will take your wedding to the next level!

I got married up in Truro at a venue that requires you to bring everything yourself (rent tent/tables, bring in catering, mobile bar/etc). Custom / Chapins Catering was recommended by my planner and I am so happy we went with them! My venue has didn’t even have a kitchen so I needed an incredibly experienced catering company that could help set things up / break things down. They luckily had been to my venue before so already knew what to do and did an amazing job at keeping the flow of the wedding going. Megan who helped organize everything was a pleasure to work with and so responsive. Everyone from the chefs to the staff were so professional and sweet during our wedding and the food came out even better than I imagined! We did family style dinner with a classic Cape cuisine that of course incorporated lots of seafood and everything was so delicious. Our guests were raving about the food. I cannot thank everyone from custom catering enough for all their hard work and they played such a big role in making our wedding day go so seamlessly. if you are looking for a wedding caterer, look no further!

The tasting experience was fantastic! They were professional and so nice and gave us just the right balance of attention and time to talk. All of the flavors we tried were so good too! The cake was amazing on the day as well! Our only regret was not asking our venue staff to set aside slices of all the flavors for us to have later.

We used Timothy S. Hopkins Catering for our wedding last September and they were amazing to work with! Sarah was responsive, professional, and so knowledgeable. She made sure everything was perfect / how we wanted it, and it took a ton of stress away the day of. Definitely recommend using them for your next event!!

We truly cannot say enough good things about this catering team. From start to finish, they were incredibly flexible, responsive, and genuinely wonderful to work with — which alone would’ve made them a great choice. But the food? Unreal. We chose to do family-style service, which is more unique and definitely not the easiest format — and they absolutely crushed it. Everything came out hot, perfectly timed, and beautifully presented, all while keeping the flow of the night seamless. Never in my life have I been to a wedding and left talking about the food… and yet almost six months later, it is still the first thing people bring up when they talk about our wedding. The lobster rolls, the sliders, the mashed potatoes, the meats — every single bite was outstanding. Nothing felt like “typical wedding food.” It was genuinely so delicious! We also opted to do an ice cream sundae bar for dessert and it was the perfect summer wedding treat! Darcy and the rest of the staff were absolute rock stars. So professional, so kind, and totally on top of everything throughout the entire process. They made us and our guests feel genuinely taken care of. If you’re considering them for your wedding or any event — do it. We would choose them again in a heartbeat and recommend them without hesitation.

Bob at Cape Caterers is the best! We looked at a number of caterers for our wedding, Bob was the most personable and the most professional and his options for food were better than the others. His food is incredible, from the passed apps to the raw bar to the entrees… There was not a single person at our wedding that didn’t say the food was amazing. Bob took the time during the weeks and months leading up to the wedding to make sure everyone was on the same page and it made for a smooth experience. 10/10 would recommend for any wedding/catered event.

We cannot recommend Off the Vine Catering highly enough! They truly were the full package for our wedding. Not only did they provide the food and bar, but they also handled most of our rentals including the chairs, tableware, signage, and even set up all of the décor we brought. Everything looked beautiful and was set up exactly how we envisioned it! The tasting is what sold us from the very beginning. Their food was far better than anything else we tried. Even though they were on the higher end of our budget, the team worked with us to create a menu that matched what we wanted while still being affordable. We mostly worked with Anne, who was amazing throughout the entire planning process! She answered every single email so quickly, reached out to other vendors on our behalf, and was so organized that we never felt like we needed a wedding coordinator. On the wedding day, they arrived early and had everything set up before we even got there. They also managed the full room flip, turning the ceremony space into the reception space during cocktail hour, and our guests never even realized it was happening. The staff was kind, attentive, and professional the entire day. Isabelle, our head server, took such great care of us! She made sure we always had food and drinks in hand and that we didn’t miss out on anything during cocktail hour or dinner. And the food was every bit as good as it had been at the tasting. We chose buffet style, and everything was fresh, hot, and flavorful. It honestly tasted like it had been made for each guest individually, which is so impressive for a buffet. Even the chicken stayed perfectly juicy! They also served plated salads during the toasts, which was such an excellent idea. For dessert, we skipped the cake and went with their roaming cannoli service. It was such a hit! A chef walked around to each table piping fresh cannolis with toppings for every guest, and people are still talking about how fun and delicious it was! At the end of the night, the team broke everything down and packed up just as efficiently as they had set it up. They took care of everything so that we didn’t have to worry about anything. Off the Vine gave us incredible food, seamless service, and amazing people who truly cared about making our day perfect. Choosing them was the best decision we made for our wedding.
