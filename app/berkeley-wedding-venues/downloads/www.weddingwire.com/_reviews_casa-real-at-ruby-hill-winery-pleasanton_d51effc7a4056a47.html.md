This place was amazing for our July wedding!

My fiance and I were married last month at Casa and it was amazing! Virginia and Kara, and all of the staff were amazing since the moment we first went to tour the venue about 8 months before our big date. They were all so extremely professional, kind, responsive and very helpful in our planning throughout. Casa offers everything included, or you can further personalize. We chose to use everything that is provided (white linens, chairs, china, etc). We were not disappointed. Everything looked so elegant. And the food - the food was amazing. All of our guests raved about how delicious the food was (we offered our guests a choice of chicken gruyere as well as the filet mignon). They also accommodated several people with multiple allergies (we were told by the guests that the chef came out and directly spoke with them to walk through the ingredients). This and other personal touches throughout the night helped make our night so memorable. It is a beautiful venue with lots of options! I was very concerned at first on how such a large space could accommodate my relatively small wedding of 93 people. But it worked perfect! We chose to have an ivory curtain that blocked off the cocktail hour inside, but it would have been fine without. The vineyards were perfect for sunset photos. We really can't say enough good things about this place. We highly recommend having your wedding here especially if (like us) you want/need the extra help in planning your day. They treated us wonderfully. We loved how we were able to enjoy cocktail hour while taking photos. There were two servers that accompanied us during pictures with a cart food of food and drinks - such an awesome touch! Having a day- of coordinator was another great part of Casa's wedding package. We loved how we were just able to show up and enjoy our wedding! The staff made it about as stress free as a wedding could possibly be. Our wedding was on a Thursday evening which offers a discounted rate - it was a fantastic value for what we got. We highly recommend Casa!

Gorgeous and spacious venue!

We're wedding florists (Flowers Valley) and we enjoy every opportunity to work at Casa Real. The staff is fantastic and always ready to assist. The venue's elegance and charm create the perfect atmosphere for any occasion!

My Daughter’s 18th Bday

-Casa real exceeded all our expectations and even beyond! Im so glad that we chose Casa Real as the venue for our daughter’s 18th birthday last February 19, 2024. Their staff were very professional, kind and helpful from our initial inquiry, first meeting with Jenny, booking the venue, payments, food tasting, planning, and the day of the event. Kara was so amazing. She was the contact person after we have booked the venue from initial to final payments, schedule of food tasting and all our other inquiries. She never got tired of answering all our questions and making things happen for us. We could not asked for a better coordinator than Carly. She was simply the BEST! From planning up to the day of the event she worked so hard to make that day the best birthday ever for our daughter. She coordinated not only with us but also with our different vendors. On the day of the event, she made sure they got all the details from centerpiece, table set up, seating plan, bows on each chair, display of our daughter’s awards and artworks that we have provided were all in its perfect place. She even provided snacks and drinks at the suite where me and my daughter had our make up done and changed. Our 200 plus guests were so amazed by how beautiful and big the venue was and the set-up. It would have been much nicer if it was not raining and probably during summer time when all the vines have all grown back again. They were also impressed with the food from the appetizers, salad to main entree as well as the service. The salad was so good, the herb crusted cod and NY steak was cooked perfectly and delicious. The open bar was superb. Our guests were raving about how efficient and good were all the bartenders. Their system of noting the guests seating arrangement, food choices and guests’ allergies were efficient and organized. Another thing I love about them was that they allowed us to have my daughter’s favorite cake and desserts as well as Boba drinks from our own vendors. They also allowed us to provide our own bowls of instant ramen, spoons and chopsticks, as our after-party snacks which was another favorite of my daughter. My only regret was not extending the party time. Our guests were having so much fun they wish there was more time to dance and enjoy the after party snacks.

Great Venue, Great Customer Service

I have been fortunate to make my living as a professional photographer for over 3 decades, worked at countless venues all over the nation. Now base in Livermore CA, I feel extreme fortunate to be able to work at Casa Real. Casa Real hands down is one of the best wedding/event venues. The staff is top notch, truly focused on their clients and making the wedding/event run seamlessly! As a wedding/event photographer managing time, details, individuals, while still being creative is the goal at every wedding and event. This can be a challenge at times. One of the things that allows me to do my job more efficiently is have a supporting staff around me. The staff at Casa Real definitely fits this description! I know that when I have a wedding/event at Casa Real I am going to be working with the best! If you are considering wedding/event venues put Casa Real on top of your list. Beautiful venue, amazing food, and a staff that knows the meaning of great customer service!

Amazing Wedding Experience

This venue made my summer wedding an absolute dream. The staff are incredibly thorough and supportive, as they made me feel taken care of and special on the day of the wedding. They helped to get all of the little details taken care of seamlessly, and I would highly recommend this venue for anyone looking for a large space with beautiful views and high-end customer service. Our wedding coordinator, August, was also a huge contributor to making the day so incredible for us because of her calm, warm energy and professional demeanor.

Absolutely Amazing!

The Casa Real staff, Kara, and Alyssa are all amazing! All the guests were raving about how great the service was. From the beginning to end, the experience was wonderful and they answered all our emails so quickly. On the day of, the staff made sure my husband and I had water and left a platter of food in the bridal suite for us. Without our coordinator, Alyssa, I don’t know what we would have done. Everything ran so smoothly and even better than expected. I can’t wait to come back again and attend a wedding here as a guest!

Stunning Venue and Team of Pros

Casa Real made all of our wedding dreams come true! It is a challenge to write a review that is not pages long, because there are so many amazing things to say about the Casa Real office team, event planning team, day-of staff, venue, food…. From the first day we toured the property, my parents and husband and I were sold on this venue. It was apparent right away that the team is full of experts who know about every detail that goes in to a wedding, and if you don’t have the answer they are ready to guide you with options and recommendations. We felt like we were in such great hands with Kara and Antonella during the planning phase, and I cannot give high enough praise for Kelsea. Kelsea was our day-of coordinator, and all of my wedding party and family agreed she was a STAR throughout the day. She was so sweet and fun with our wedding party during the rehearsal, and everyone felt so comfortable with her on the day of the wedding. She was so good at checking in with us and our parents throughout the night. We did not hire a wedding planner, but we always felt like we had one with Casa running point. The day of our wedding ran so smoothly and we even were ahead of schedule at some points. Our day felt fun and exciting and EASY, and I attribute all of that to Casa’s expert team handling everything in the background.  
  
Casa’s preferred vendor list is top-notch and well curated so that they can recommend the best vendors in the area who are also all well-acquainted with each other. Every vendor we worked with was so complimentary of Casa Real and the work they do, and we couldn’t agree more. In addition to the impeccably appointed property (the foyer, sun garden, amber room, and grand salon are stunning even without wedding decor), one other standout from our wedding is easily the FOOD. From the snacks in the bridal suite, to the cocktail hour appetizers, to the generous and delicious entrees, to our late night donuts and french fries, to the well-stocked (and beautiful) bar, I was so proud that all of our wedding food was DELICIOUS. (One note in particular: we had multiple guests tell us this was by far the best vegetarian meal they had ever had at any wedding!) Everything about Casa Real deserves five stars - I am so thankful to their whole team!

Autumn Wedding at Casa Real magical!

11/10/22 Autumn wedding at CASA REAL was spectacular! The vineyards were highlighted with brilliant colors, which enhanced our photos! More importantly, the VENUE was top notice, starting with @karaandrews and @alyssastewart, who were willing to listen to and make specific requests happen! the transition from the Amber room to the ballroom was seamless never saw any movement from the staff. It just happened behind the scenes. Now, regarding the MENU, the CHEFS and the staff hit it out of the park! Our guests, a week later, are still calling to tell us how great each food choice was. From the appetizers to the display tables, main entree, late-night snacks, and our Donut Flambee bar!   
  
HIGHLY recommend Casa Real @beetscatering for your next event, no matter the occasion. Mother of the bride, Lois

The BEST venue & team, THANK YOU!!!

If you are looking for a venue for your dream wedding then you should definitely check out Casa Real! They made sure everything ran smoothly and was always there for us to answer and help us with the million questions we had.  
They made sure the wedding had everything we wanted from tons of delious food to a last minute tea cermony and even snowballs! The venue was breathtakingly beutiful on its own, which helped us with saving on decorations.  
The team was very helpful throughout the planning stages and the event itself to make sure everything ran smoothly and on time and they even made sure we got a chance to try all the food! They made sure we were well fed throughout from a champagne cart to platters of each item during our cocktail hour. We even had a full spread of apps and each of our specialty drinks ready for us at our sweetheart table!  
They even have an in house bakery that made our delious cakes. We wanted to make sure everyone had a slice of cake at our wedding and the bakery was able to help us make custom centerpiece cakes for each table and also provided us with a wonderful spread for our dessert bar!   
It was a magical day that we will never forget and it was all thanks to the great team at casa real. Special thanks to Genevieve, Kara and team for helping make sure everything ran smoothly from the beginning to end, THANK YOU for helping us with our dream wedding!!!

Highly recommend Casa Real!

Choosing a wedding venue can be such an overwhelming process; however, after our initial Zoom meeting with Marlene, we were very impressed with the venue and amenities. Once we came on site for an in-person tour, the venue exceeded our expectations and we selected Casa Real as our wedding venue without hesitation! We chose are venue in April 2021 and got married in September 2022. Though the venue is breathtaking in itself, the support and level of organization and detail from the staff is exemplary! Our wedding date was nearly a year and a half away, and Kara was extremely responsive, patient, and always kind in answering any questions that we had. We met with our assigned coordinator, Alyssa, three months prior to our wedding date, and feel that she played such a pivotal role in the ease that we felt leading up to and on our wedding day. She was very attentive to our vision and made sure to honor and highlight various aspects of our wedding that we asked for. Alyssa ran our rehearsal efficiently. On the day of our wedding, my husband and I were able to just relax and stay present, as Alyssa took care of all of the details and frequently checked in with us to make sure we were eating enough and were hydrated; she pivoted when necessary to make sure we had enough time to eat, which we were so grateful for. Some of our vendors also commented on how impressed they were with the quality of Alyssa's work as our coordinator. The venue staff were amazing and were so kind to us and our guests. Our guests raved about the appetizers and dinner; many mentioned that this was the best wedding food they've had! We cannot thank the Casa Real staff enough for making our wedding day so magical!

Beautiful Venue, Professional Wedding Experts

I have so many good things to say about Casa Real, I don’t know where to start! When my husband and I were touring venues, Casa Real immediately stood out to us because of how beautiful it was - it’s a lovely villa nestled in a field of vineyards - but also because of the professionalism and knowledge of the staff. After booking them, so many of our other vendors expressed how much they liked working with Casa Real - “They are such a well-oiled machined”, “They are so on top of things that if anything went wrong, you would never know”, “You can’t do better than Casa Real for a wedding venue in this area” are so of the comments we heard, and we couldn’t agree more. Tammy, our dedicated Casa Real wedding coordinator, did an excellent job in walking us through the planning process during our meetings. She is dedicated, hard-working, and so pleasant to work with. She, Kara, and the rest of the Casa Real staff were so kind, friendly, and very available by phone and email to answer our questions. We also loved the option of having the ceremony in either the Amber Room or the Sun Garden - this is REALLY important for this area. Especially with summer weddings, you never know if there will be California fires or 100+ F weather, so it’s so beneficial to have the option of switching indoors. We actually ended up switching the ceremony location a few days before because of inclement weather. The day of our wedding was a dream come true - everything ran so seamlessly, smoothly, and on time due to Casa Real’s expertise and careful planning. I HIGHLY recommend them if you’re looking for a wedding venue.

Best Wedding Venue!

We could not have chosen a better wedding venue! The venue itself is absolutely gorgeous, we received so many compliments on the delicious food and premium drinks, and the staff was extremely helpful and made wedding planning much easier with trackers, suggested timelines, etc. Our wedding coordinator Jasmyn was so organized during our planning meetings (and on the Wedding day), made us feel at ease, and prioritized our vision for the day! We also worked closely with Kara during the planning process who was very supportive and always prompt to respond to any questions we had.   
  
We had our wedding ceremony and reception at Casa Real in August and the day could not have been more perfect. We highly recommend Casa Real as a wedding venue!!

The BEST I could have asked for!

Casa Real really went above and beyond my expectations when it came to wedding venues. The venue is not just beautiful, but the staff and all the wonderful people I worked with were so kind, responsive, and made sure that everything, down to the last detail, was perfect.   
From the day I first contacted the venue, the staff were so kind to answer all of my questions and concerns. They even accommodated our schedule to have a tour during the weekday, though it wasn’t their usual time. Emailing back and forth and making decisions about the wedding was so seamless that it was kind of scary not to be worrying about everything.   
Leading up to the wedding, I was assigned Antonella as my day-of coordinator and I couldn’t have asked for a better person for the job. She was quick to respond to emails and make any adjustments when last minute changes occurred. I especially thank her for the day of the wedding because I didn’t have to worry about ANYTHING. The reception at Casa Real and thanks to Antonella and all of the staff, the reception went so smoothly that, again, it was scary. She made sure me and the groom were comfortable and handled all the little details. What an amazing person to work with!  
As for the catering, everything was top notch. I have friends who came from SoCal (the land of boba drinks) and they were even impressed by the boba bar that we added to the wedding from Casa Real. All the guests were fawning over the appetizers and were even asking for more even after it all ran out. The reception food was amazing, especially the pork shoulder. The dessert was even more amazing! I still dream about the creme brulee shortbread and mini blueberry cheesecakes.   
Overall, you can’t get anything better than Casa Real in my opinion. If I could redo my wedding all over again, I would still go with Casa Real because that’s how good my experience was from the very beginning up until the wedding day.

Very lucky to have Casa Real for our reception 

Is it possible to pull off a really memorable wedding reception with everything you want with 3 months notice? I can proudly say with Casa Real it is. There are no weaknesses in the armor of this comprehensive venue and the strengths are in its tight coordination of excellent staff. They are able to pull off very specific preferences as well as autopilot you to a coherent experience. Because of our tight deadline we were constantly on the ropes but Antonella and Kara made sure we were on time and everything fit together. The day of reception Antonella was our captain and expertly sailed us through the evening seamlessly and over bumps in our packed schedule smoothly. The stealth army-like staff was amazing and we felt like VIPs. My pickiest foodie friends were very happy and my booziest friends were too happy. We picked the boba bar as an add on and I think my boba fans had 5 each. And lastly it’s hard to forget that the grounds are impeccable and beautiful and feel like you are at a wine country resort. We feel incredibly lucky that we were able to find Casa Real at all but doubly so on short notice. Lastly I can see why these preferred vendors are preferred. Nicole Ha (florist), Bev Tanaka (cake design), DJ Rick/Amos Productions (DJ and photobooth), Courtyard Livermore (hotel and shuttle), and Phoenix Wang (photographer, not preferred yet but should be) were heroes assembling to make everything just work without a fuss. I am so grateful to these super wedding professionals and their seamless coordination with Casa Real needing only the absolute minimum essential input from us. They are collectively what made a 3 month prep wedding possible and I did not feel the need for an additional wedding planner. If I was sent back in time I’d definitely do it with Casa Real again.

Perfect Venue and Perfect Coordinators

My wife and I had our wedding reception at Casa Real in June and worked closely with Genevieve and Kara as part of the venue's coordinator team. The event was perfect. Everything including preparation, the three-course meal, the open bar, the venue layout, the event execution, etc. seemed to go exactly as planned with very little effort the day of the wedding.   
  
I can go on about every little detail for Casa Real, but ultimately I think it comes down to one of Genevieve's last statements to us before the big day. She told us that our only job the day of the wedding was to relax and enjoy the celebration. Casa Real easily deserves 5 stars because they allowed us to do just that, and we truly got to enjoy our reception thanks to their hard working, organized, professional, and personable team.   
  
Thank you Genevieve, Kara, and Casa Real!

Nothing Short of Spectacular!

I just had my wedding at at Casa Real and it was a magical experience! Genevieve was our wedding coordinator and was a delight to work with. We had lots of plans and items that needed to happen and come out at the right times during the evening. Genevieve and her staff made out lots of attention to detail and made sure the event is as organized as it possibly can be. I was very impressed with the level of service that we received and I still hear compliments from our guests till this day! The food and beverages were great as well. Overall, it was a fabulous time at Casa Real. I would recommend this venue to anyone who wants an incredible experience for their special day!!!

Amazing Venue

We could not have asked for a better wedding day. I already knew I wanted to get married at Casa Real since my husband and I went to prom together here, but I was completely blown out of the water the entire night. The staff and venue were incredibly kind, organized, and my guests could not stop raving about how much fun they had, how good the food was, and how smoothly the night went. Going through their preferred vendors, having the rentals, food, and open bar already done on site made wedding planning a breeze. My only regret was that we didn’t add on more time to the night. We got a day of coordinator, Carly who was the BEST. My dress and one of the bridesmaids dresses entirely broke before the ceremony and reception and she kept us all calm, and fixed both problems. She handled all the fires that arose and I don’t think I would’ve been able to relax that day as much as I did without her!! My husband and I also had our own personal servers and we did not have a single empty drink the entire night.

Perfect venue for Indian wedding and reception!

Casa Real was the perfect venue for our ~300 person Indian wedding this past May - and we cannot say enough positive things about our experience there.  
  
To start with the venue:  
It is gorgeous, both indoors and outdoors. Each room has architectural and furniture details that add character, and the outdoor spaces are tastefully landscaped. When all of these spaces are opened up (for example, during a reception), it gives guests plenty of options to mingle and roam per their needs.  
It has a number of different areas that can accommodate multiple different potential flows for your event and large groups of people without feeling intimidating or claustrophobic. For us, having different areas to do the Baraat, Ceremony, and Reception was important, and Casa Real could accommodate all of these needs.  
It is located in the heart of the Pleasanton vineyards, and is relatively easy to get to from multiple parts of the Bay Area.  
All of the indoor and outdoor spaces can be used in multiple different ways - this was important to us as we wanted to have an outdoor ceremony, but also wanted the flexibility to move it indoors should the weather be less than ideal. Casa Real’s variety of spaces made it possible to execute this plan B when it actually did rain the day of our wedding.  
  
What really set Casa Real apart for us was the engaging and wonderful staff:  
They are completely on top of the details and help guide you through the planning process from the moment you sign the contract.  
They are responsive, proactive, and have a positive attitude, from dealing with concerns to brainstorming solutions to problems.  
They are extremely attentive to their clients’ needs, creatively finding ways to meet requests and working with you to make sure the day meets your vision while still being logistically feasible.   
They have a wide variety of preferred vendors who can help transform the space for whatever vibe you are going for in your event.  
They have been doing this for a while, and have seen quite a bit, and so are prepared for almost every eventuality - case in point, our last minute changes when it was raining on our wedding day.   
  
Casa Real made our dream wedding a reality - and we cannot thank them enough for it!   
  
Here are a few photos from the event: https://manaliannephotography.com/casa-real-wedding-pleasanton/

Absolutely EXCELLENT venue

I could not have asked for a more professional, organized, excellent venue for my wedding this past October. We were doing a multicultural wedding and were really only looking at Palm Events Center and Casa Real as our options for our ~250 guests. We booked almost 15 months in advance and got one of the last peak season wedding dates in late October.   
  
I could go on and on about how great Casa Real is but I'll keep it to a few simple points:  
  
TEAM: Kara, Marlena, and Nicole are top of line event planners, people managers, and venue coordinators. They are highly responsive, even with the most minute of details. They are always willing to help out and offer information and guidance where asked for. I did not hire a wedding planner and relied on Casa Real and a day of coordinator (Marlena) to plan and execute the wedding. It was a lot of work but would not have been possible without the expert help of the venue and its team. They didn't miss a beat in terms of communicating with us and among each other. We used a lot of the vendors recommended by Casa Real and the familiarity they had with working together really made the planning process smooth. I've had at least one vendor tell me that they wouldn't have worked with me without a wedding planner if not for the great reputation of Casa Real.  
  
VENUE: We had a long and complex day and were doing two ceremonies and given Casa Real's large space were able to do one ceremony in the gorgeous Sun Garden and the second ceremony in the Amber room. The flow of the space and crowd management led by Marlena was absolutely expert. Our guests were seamlessly led from one room/ part of the wedding to the other without much difficulty or issue. This made for the SMOOTHEST guest experience.  
  
MULTICULTURAL: Casa Real gave flexibility to me to bring in my own caterer since I wanted Indo-Chinese catering. They also had a stage I could use for the mandap. They also had a perfectly nice route among the vineyards in the front of the venue for my husband's baraat (where he rides in on a horse). Their snack and food choices included cool things like boba tea and mexican churros with hot chocolate.   
  
SERVICE: I mean they set up everything. When the rentals came in, Casa Real's team was on it setting up tables and linens and plates and gifts in accordance with how I laid it out. It was perfect.  
  
CONNECTION: Casa Real's team really does their best to help you execute a perfect wedding and for that I am so grateful. They really do have their couples (especially their brides) top of mind all the time. And they don't make you feel crazy even if you might be crazy.  
  
I love this venue and its team! Thank you for helping me plan an amazing wedding!

Amazing Place for our Wedding! 

Casa Real is a true gem of a place! We got married there 3 months ago and find excuses to go back to see the space and the people!   
  
Every single teammate on the Casa Real team was hard-working, genuine and responsive. The culture is extremely client-centered, which was welcomed when there are so many people/vendors to work with. They really made it easy for us to have an authentically us wedding. Our wedding coordinator and Alli worked extremely well together in getting everything done leading to and during the wedding.   
  
The venue is gorgeous, well maintained both inside and outside. There are four different spaces for different ‘feels’ for your respective event, and we happily used three and it was perfect. We got the perfect fall photos we were hoping for!   
  
We are extremely fortunate to have gotten married at Casa Real!

My husband and I, and our families, cannot say enough wonderful things about this venue and the staff. The grounds are beautiful and kept so immaculate. The staff are wonderful from day 1 (special thanks to Kara and our amazing day of coordinator Z!) and are SO helpful throughout the whole process. They are super responsive with emails and phone calls and are very easy to communicate with throughout the process. They are so organized and timely- our wedding day went seemlessly and I had 0 stress thanks to them and knowing everything was taken care of. They genuinely care about their clients. The food is delicious- and you get a tasting night at the venue a few months before the wedding. Thanks Casa for everything!

Amazing venue! Awesome employees—everyone of them. Especially Cara and Zee! I was the mother of the bride and they were a step ahead of everything! The food was so delicious! My daughter’s wedding was perfect! I can’t say enough! You will never find a more beautiful place to get married! They have a list of awesome vendors to work with too.

Casa Real is an amazing place for a wedding. There is a lot of space included so guests have a lot of places to hang out during reception. The decor is very nice so even if you don't have many decorations or lighting, it still looks amazing. We got a lot of compliments on our wedding and some people mentioned it as one of their favorites that they attended. My favorite place was the outside garden area where there were market lights and a fire pit. Another great thing was the food options. Guests really enjoyed the food, especially the steak for dinner, the tuna appetizer, and donut flambe.   
  
Everyone there is terrific. Extra shout outs to Sandy and Kara who we worked with most often during the planning process. Sandy (who also was our day of coordinator) is super! She was on top of everything and is the sweetest.   
  
Would highly recommend to check out Casa Real if you are planning a wedding.

The food was amazing, the staff was professional, the venue is beautiful, and the experience is unforgettable. If you have the budget for this place and are still looking at other venues, stop now. This is where you want to be. They hold hundreds of weddings each year, and now we know why. We worked with Sandy as our wedding coordinator, but every member of their team was super responsive and incredibly helpful during our planning process. Our wedding guests raved about the aesthetics, the food (omg the food), and the overall atmosphere. The staff at Casa Real are great about making sure every single detail is covered so you don't have to worry about anything on that day. And if you opt for the day-of coordinator, they make sure to keep you on schedule so that everything you have planned works to perfection. Our guests even noted that nothing felt rushed throughout our event, and we owe that all to the team at Casa Real. Stop looking around and book this place!

This was the first and only venue my husband and I looked at when we were searching. We first found it online and the photos alone were absolutely amazing! When we went in for a visit we met with Samantha and we instantly fell in love with the venue! The space, the scenery and the staff were all amazing. Samantha, our coordinator, and Kara were so helpful and very responsive. They were also very patient with me and my many changes of ideas! But all in all they were able to help us pull off one of the best weddings ever! Thank you ladies for helping us create such a memorable wedding!

Book them! Honestly, this has to be the go-to venue to host your wedding in the Bay Area. When you first take a tour of the venue, it’s impossible not to fall in love with the place. You and your significant other will feel pampered from the initial tour, to their annual extravagant Casa Amore Vendor Showcase, and to the elegant food tasting three months prior to your wedding date. Just leading up to the wedding is an experience to enjoy in it of itself. That’s probably why you have to book more than a year in advance to get the date you want. This place is in high demand, for so many good reasons that there isn't enough space in here for us to cover.  
The secret to a great wedding is to have people behind the scenes who know what they are doing. Casa Real is a well-oiled machine. We worked exclusively with Zainab and Kara who were both constant professionals throughout the whole process making sure every detail (so many) got covered. Zainab was our day of coordinator which is an additional fee but worth every penny if you want your wedding day to go smoothly. We primarily communicated via email, and Kara’s response time is legendary. The four of us worked together in harmony in creating an awesome wedding.   
Casa Real provides the basic essentials to host any wedding. The big one is the food. The number of items on their menu is impressive and overwhelming. It is no exaggeration that practically everything we tasted was delicious, so attempting to pick only two food entrees was a difficult task for us. Late-night snacks are increasingly becoming a staple for any wedding, and Casa has plenty to choose from. We would totally be customers if they ever decide to open up a Restaurant de Casa. Our guests could not stop raving about how great the food tasted during and after the wedding.  
After it was all said and done, the wedding was a big success and everyone had a great time. I can’t think of another venue more perfect than Casa Real to have hosted our wedding.

Casa Real made my wedding day and all of the planning leading up to the big day so easy. I am a very detailed person and I ask a lot of questions. Kara & Sandy (my day of coordinator) were very quick to respond to all of my questions while never seeming to loose patience with me or my mom which can be hard to do :).. I could not have been happier with the originazation and flow on the day of. Sandy was so great about making sure that the timeline of the day flowed as planned while also managing to make sure that the groom and I got a chance to eat and have fun. Aside from the coordinators who are amazing the venue itself it gorgeous and very elegant. Casa Real truly has weddings down, our guests raved about the food and the venue. It is so gorgeous that you really don't need to do too much to decorate it and mostly. An open bar is included in the venue cost which was our parents biggest selling point because they didn't have to worry about a bar tab at the end of the night and your guests don't have to worry about a cash bar. The open bar was of course a big hit with our guests and also made for an awesome party! Casa Real provided such an amazing list of preferred vendors. I used about 90% of the almost vendors from their list and was so overjoyed with all of them. My wedding was better than I ever could have imagined and most of it was all thanks them. I would recommend Casa Real to anyone and would and am so thankful I was able to have the wedding of my dreams there with the help of Sandy and Kara who I can not say enough good things about :)

As soon as we toured Casa Real 15 months before our wedding day, we knew it would be the perfect place for us. What we didn’t know was how incredible the team there is. We began working with Kara, who helped us with securing our date, paying our deposit, and explaining our agreements. Soon after, we began working with Samantha, who helped us decide every detail of our day. I had so many questions throughout the process, and the team always responded promptly and never made me feel bad for sending so many emails! Their professionalism, friendliness, and organization helped reassure us that our day would be seamless.   
  
We chose to have a day of coordinator, and there aren’t enough words to express how helpful Samantha was that day. She kept our day on schedule, and when it wasn’t, she calmly made decisions to make sure everyone was happy! I had so many people in my bridal party and family comment about how great she was. Before I walked down the aisle, she noticed I didn’t have my blusher over my face!! I would have been so sad to have forgotten that detail. If you are planning a wedding in the Bay Area, I would strongly suggest checking out Casa Real at Ruby Hill Winery. They will NOT disappoint! I just wish we could do it again!!  
  
PS - The French Fry Bar was a huge hit :)

Casa Real is a very beautiful venue with such amazing staff. Their staff is so professional and their quality of service was great from beginning to end. They were always very responsive and helpful with answering all our questions. We had so many compliments from our family and friends on our wedding day. My husband and I were so pleased with the service, the food and the beauty of the venue truly speaks for itself. We couldn't have asked for a better venue and service on our Wedding day.

There is a reason why you have to book this venue so far in advance!   
  
I booked my date a year and a half prior because I wanted a weekend in June, which I know is an extremely popular time to have a wedding. We live in the East Bay so the location was very convenient for us. We were blown away by the natural beauty: the grounds are well-maintained and clean, the ceilings are very high, and the architecture is exquisite. However, Casa Real is also a clean slate and you can really change it however you want to fit your style. These are just some of the reasons why we picked Casa Real and would recommend it to anyone:  
  
\- your wedding will be the only one happening that day  
\- very convenient, free, large parking lot  
\- we wanted both an indoor ceremony and reception (but for brides that want an outdoor ceremony, they can do that too)  
\- they can hold very large weddings if they need to   
\- all-in-one packaging (don't have to worry about dining rentals, outside catering, etc)  
\- BEST STAFF EVER (very professional, friendly, very timely with e-mails, very organized and detail-oriented... they have planning and coordinating weddings down to a science!) They were super accommodating, even with last minute changes. You will not regret hiring them as your day-of-coordinator. Thank you so much to Kara and Sandy!  
\- great food (we had the New York Steak and the Alaskan Cod and both were delicious; my groom finished his cod entirely! Who says you can't eat well at your wedding?) We also had a vegetable caponata for the vegetarian/vegan course. For appetizers, we had the bacon/chorizo/date, potato/marrow, ahi tuna, and eggplant crostini (vegan) and everyone said they were delicious.   
\- they can do Sunday weddings and it's cheaper  
  
I had the best time of my life at my wedding, and part of the reason was that there was a great team at Casa Real that made sure that things ran smoothly, and it did!

I have been waiting to write this review and after 9 months of wedding planning the time has finally come!! Our wedding was on March 30, 2014 and it was absolutely flawless. I knew as soon as I visited Casa that it was the place for me. Be advised that they are in high demand and for damn good reason. Don't wait until 6 months before your desired date because it more than likely won't happen. Before I get to the impeccable service I'll start with the actual venue. The options are endless because it's basically a clean canvas. You can get married in 3 different locations and have the reception in one of two rooms. I chose the amber room for both and they flipped the room during cocktail hour. I don't think this is the norm here, but our wedding was 100 people and too small for the grand ballroom which can easily fit 200+. We could have rented furniture, draping and/or a partition, but let's face it weddings are already expensive. This place is pricey, but worth every single penny. Casa comes with a sweet candle package that really sets the stage for romance. I wanted a darker candlelit setting and they nailed it. The food is REALLY good, so much more than I expected and I'm pretty damn picky. The drinks are also tasty. We designed two signature drinks that were delicious and the wine was actually really good as well. They have a no shot policy and I think it's the smartest thing ever. I myself am a shot taker and had I had the option I would have been much more drunk than was necessary. I was just the right amount of intoxicated. This seems like a silly thing to include in a review, but for a drinker like myself it's helpful info.   
  
The SERVICE -wow, I can't give them enough praise. I am borderline, ok, I am a control freak and the team here put any and all worries I had to ease. I worked with Kara and Z and I never waited more than an hour for a response. That is huge for a person like myself. I expect responsiveness and thorough responses at that when it comes to w

We had our wedding here in May 2013, and we have absolutely nothing but good things to say about this venue! We booked our date in January 2012, and so glad we did because dates were booking up fast! I can go on and on about what a great venue this is!   
\- Kara is amazing! She was our main point of contact from the beginning. She has the quickest responses, is soo patient and willing to answer every question you have (whether it's email or in person, and trust me, I had a billion questions almost every day in the month leading up to our wedding), and is extremely willing to accommodate and address any concerns or issues we had!  
\- The planning process is very structured and detailed. Casa Real gives you a questionnaire to fill out ahead of time that you go over with your coordinator, detailing everything from venue diagrams, how you want your napkin folded, and even who is in charge of the leftover cake.   
\- The venue itself is BEAUTIFUL! We got so many compliments on the gorgeous Sun Garden, high ceilings of the Grand Salon, and beautiful atmosphere of the Amber room.   
\- Alyssia, our day of coordinator, is absolutely amazing as well! She was so helpful and all my friends and family LOVED her. She was great at our finalization meeting, patient and extremely helpful. At our rehearsal, she took charge and gave great tips to all of us for our wedding day. On our wedding day, even my mother was impressed by how on top of it she was, and how Alyssia was quick to have anything we needed. Eyelash glue? She's got it! If there are any hiccups or concerns throughout the day, Alyssia usually addresses and fixes them herself, and only goes to the bride for the final say. If there were any problems on our wedding day, I really had no idea since Alyssia was there to save the day!  
Phew I could go on and on, but I will stop here. We loved Casa Real and it was probably one of the best decisions we made to have our wedding here.

We got married here on Friday, May 31, 2013. We can't say enough about this place. It was gorgeous! Everything was in bloom including the vines, making our pictures turn out amazing. The inside decor is beautiful. We only got two decor upgrades, the candle package and up lighting. Both of those with our amazing florist (Delford West, a preferred vendor of Casa) the room were perfect. We used the standard chairs, which matched our colors of the wedding, and we thought it looked great.   
  
We had Alyssia Lundgren as our day of coordinator, which we highly recommend getting. Not only the day of coordinator, but her especially. She is very sweet and was there for everything, even the things we did not expect.   
  
So since the wedding was on a Friday the food choices are limited, but you can get pretty much anything you want as an upgrade. We went with Chicken Saltimbocca and a New York Steak. All the food was perfect. We still are being told by guests that the steak was the best they have ever had. Not just at a wedding, but ever. The best part, it was not like a typical wedding where the piece of meat is very small. The steaks were so big there were a lot of people that could not even finish it. Very good portions and best of all delicious. Recommend getting the streak upgrade if it is not an option.   
  
If you want your wedding to be perfect go with Casa Real at Ruby Hill Winery.

Casa Real was the perfect one shop stop for our wedding. We had both our ceremony and reception here. The venue is absolutely beautiful and elegant. We had so many compliments about how nice the place was. The staff at Casa Real was friendly, professional and helpful. They were very responsive to all my emails and questions. Working with all the coordinators was easy, they really knew their stuff and would tell me things that I never thought about. The food was delicious, everyone loved the prime rib. Would highly recommend having a wedding here, it's worth it.

I can't say enough good things about Casa Real and the whole staff there! Especially Alyssia and Kara! Alyssia was my day of coordinator at Casa Real and she was fantastic, organized, knows Indian weddings, and kept things going on track the whole day. But even before the wedding both her and Kara were always willing to talk and answer questions (which we had lots of) throughout the wedding planning process. Aside from the great staff, Casa Real is a gorgeous venue and I'm so lucky to have gotten married there! They get booked fast and are always busy with events but they definitely know how to make you feel special on your big day!

This is another review that has taken far too long for me to write but I just can't let the year go by without saying how happy we were that we had our wedding at Casa Real at Ruby Hill Winery. The venue itself is gorgeous but the service and the experience we had planning a wedding was even more perfect. The team they employ to create events knows what they're doing and they do a lot of weddings but they don't make you feel like you're just another date on their calendar. I had to plan my wedding at Casa Real remotely and they were so flexible in working with us. The organization on their part is seamless and not only did the planning go smoothly, but the event flew by so smoothly that I couldn't believe it was over when it was. The little touches that Casa provides on your wedding day to make you feel special are all included in your package and really do make you feel important...they don't try to nickle and dime you for every little thing like other local venues do (ahem Wente). The last item I want to comment on is the food - people are still raving about it and they loved the family style option that Casa provided. They really went out of our wedding day special and I would tell someone to have their wedding there in a heartbeat.

Selecting Casa Real for our wedding venue was one of the best decisions. The staff was amazing, especially Alyssia who was our day of coordinator. I don't know what we would have done without her. She was on top of everything.   
  
The venue itself from the Amber Room, to the Grand Salon to the Courtyard are immaculate! The food is out of this world and our guests raved about the quality and taste of the meal.   
  
Casa Real was everything we could dream of for a perfect wedding. It may be on the pricer side but with the service and quality you get, you will not be disappointed. It truly was a magical day!

Casa Real was the best decision we made when it came to our wedding. The entire staff was extremely helpful and was awesome during the entire planning process. They day of was absolutely perfect. We are still getting compliments from our guests on how wonderful everything was especially the venue. The service is impeccable and the venue itself is gorgeous. A special thank you to Alyssia our day of coordinator. I could not have made it through the day without her. She made sure everything was perfect. If trying to find a place that will help you through the entire process and make your day absolutely perfect, then have it at Casa Real!

Casa Real was one of the BEST decisions we made for our wedding. Everything was top notch from the beginning. The staff is very friendly, knowledgeable, and responsive. Communication was a breeze, even with last minute changes. Our coordinator was Alyssia, and she was AMAZING! We don't know what we would do without her. Our guests even praised ALL of the waiters & staff the night of our wedding!  
  
Venue was one of the most beautiful places we saw. You get a lot of delicious food choices to choose from, and you don't have to worry about not having enough food.   
  
Casa Real was everything we could dream of for a perfect, stress-free wedding. The prices may be a little higher, but still affordable, and definitely worth every penny. Words really can't describe how wonderful Casa Real was.

Casa Real was the perfect place for our wedding. We fell in love with the venue the first time we saw it, and went back to book it the very next day. The setting is unbeatable, and they clearly have the wedding business down to an art. The people I worked with at Casa Real were so professional and really helped make our wedding come together. In particular, our coordinator Zainab, was so organized, friendly and professional. We had such a wonderful experience with Casa Real. Wish we could do it all again!

Casa Real and then entire team are wonderful. I had the wedding of my dreams, my husband and I have said many times since that we would love to do it all again, and do it the exact same way! The food was wonderful, the venue is beautiful all on its own, but when it is all decorated and filled with all the people you love it just makes it that much better. Z was our day of coordinator and she did a great job. Anything we needed she seemed to have right there and ready. I couldn't have asked for a better experience! The day of coordinator is a MUST!! My family and I didn't need to do anything or stress about keeping things on time.

They are very professional and responsive! There are so many details in wedding planning, and they were able to keep up, even with my type A personality. They made sure everything was decorated beautifully on our wedding day. I know that it's the small, well-executed details of an event that create a story - a lasting impression, and that's what they created for us and our guests!

Casa Real is the best venue! Zainab was our wedding coordinator and she helped and guided me through the wedding process the entire 13 months from the date we booked the venue to the day of our wedding. The staff at Casa Real is AMAZING!!!! Everyone there is so professional and courteous. Our wedding day was so smooth and seamless because of Zainab. She kept everything on schedule and made my wedding dreams come true. The food was amazing and I'm still hearing from our guests that this was the best wedding food they have ever had. 5 stars all the way!!!

I couldn't be happier with the service and venue that Casa Real provided me for my wedding day. Venue- We got married in December so we had our ceremony on site in the Amber Room. My guests were amazed when they walked in the room and saw the amazing fire place setting the seen. The receptions room was classy and had plenty of room for our guest to be comfortable and not crammed in. Service- The Casa Real staff was AMAZING. There number one concern is customer service and they are so good at what they do. Food- Wow! We chose family style and we couldn't of been happier. The food was to die for.

Casa Real was above and beyond everything we could have wanted in a ceremony cite. The Amber Room was perfectly lit and was the perfect backdrop for the ceremony and vows. During cocktail hour guest were served excellent food (I've been told) and they ate outside where their pictures had an amazing backdrop of the vineyards. At that point we were able to take great photos with family and wedding party in the great scenery in front of and around the grounds. The food was next, and it was served family style. Everyone got a good portion of food, and got great reviews about it all. The rest of the night was full of dancing for hours and hours. So the open bar did its job well too!! Finally at 10ish we got the cheeseburger upgrade, which were delicious!!  
  
I'm sure there is more I'm forgetting about, but 5 stars for the whole event.  
  
Also, Shannon was a great coordinator for the rehearsal and day of! 5 Stars to her aswell!!

Casa Real was the first location we looked at for our wedding reception and after our first meeting with the staff and the tour of the property, no other venues measured up for our big day. The property allows for indoor and outdoor ceremonies so weather will never be an issue. The grounds are beautiful and allow for lots of photo opportunities. You have water fountains to choose from, a beautiful Mediterranean feel, and of course the vineyards.   
  
The staff at Casa Real were phenomenal!! They literally thought of and helped plan every little detail to make sure our wedding day went smoothly. They knew when the sun would set and would cast a beautiful glow across the vineyards and kept the doors closed until this little surprise could be reveled. They are so organized that nothing is left to chance. We can honestly say our wedding was PERFECT! If something went wrong, we were never aware of it. The staff will answer any question with grace and professionalism. They are there to ensure you have nothing to worry about on your big day. Thank you Kara and Alyssia!!!!   
  
The food…wow, where do we even start! It was out of this world… to put it mildly!!  
We had over 250 guests at our wedding, and all of them are still raving about how great everything was. Chef Adam made certain that everything was to our liking and even made some special recommendations for our menu. We highly recommend the family-style service. Not only was the food abundant, but it got all of our guests talking and sharing.   
  
Casa Real is worth every penny you'll spend on your wedding day and will be the last place you look for a venue in the Livermore area.

We got married July 25, 2010 at Casa Real. We had both our ceremony and reception there. Our ceremony was in the Amber Room.   
  
The staff at Casa Real offered us so much help and guidance during our wedding planning process, especially on our wedding day. We couldn't have gotten a better venue or coordinator to work with. Everyone at Casa Real is professional, helpful, friendly, and we are so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with them.  
  
Their help on our wedding day made everything run smoothly, allowed everyone, including us, to enjoy themselves, and just made our day what it was. All of our family and friends had nothing but nice things to say about their attention to detail, professionalism, and friendly personalities.   
  
We are so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with the staff at Casa Real and to have our wedding day at such a beautiful venue.  
  
Everything was amazing!

Casa Real is the best looking venue in the Livermore (Pleasanton) wine country. Our wedding couldn't have been better. The Amber room is gorgeous and the reception area is dreamy especially our first dance at sunset overlooking the vineyard. The wedding coordinator Shannon McGrail was perfect, she knew exactly what to do and did everything in her power to make this special day everything we could have dreamed! Go with Casa Real if you want the most romantic wedding ever!

I had my wedding reception at Casa Real on 9/5/09. I'll try to focus on things other people have not said.  
  
The place is absolutely beautiful and very functional. We used the amber room for our cocktail hour (in addition to the courtyard), keeping our grand salon a big surprise. Right after we got out of the limo, Andrew opened up the bridal suite for us. Waiting inside was appetizers, champagne and water. The staff also checked in on us from time to time to see if we wanted more appetizers, beer, wine, etc.  
  
As others said, the food is excellent, the wait staff is excellent, the event managers are excellent and the location is just beautiful. The venue was also able to accomodate our 360 guest wedding.  
  
We were exteremely lucky to book Casa (walked in one day last October/November and somebody cancelled), so if you have the opportunity to have your wedding/reception here, I would recommend it.

AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!!! That is the only way to describe the staff of Casa Real. I had zero stress in relation to the wedding, because Casa Real took care of EVERYTHING. I had 350 guests and thought I would need to ask many friends to help with ushering, but CR staff took care of it! I handed everything to them at the rehearsal with specific instructions, and everything was carried out perfectly. I could not have imagined a more supportive staff to help me on the day of my wedding.  
  
Leading up to the wedding, Andrew and Kara were with me every step of the way. Sometimes, I would call multiple times a day with random questions/concerns, and they helped me through all of it. They're wedding planners in disguise! Andrew helped us come up with an itinerary for the ceremony and evening and made many other suggestions about when to have certain events or how to do certain things to make all transitions seamless.  
  
The food at CR is delicious and their servers are extremely friendly, professional, and quick! Everyone I spoke with that attended the wedding had an absolutely wonderful time. Both my husband's parents and my parents were also happy with the outcome. They had their own worries about crowd control and food, but CR staff helped extinguish those worries.  
  
Casa Real was the best place to have my ceremony (Amber Room) and reception!!!

Absolutely wonderful staff. They are the most helpful people I worked with the entire time planning my wedding. Alyssa was the best coordinator and I couldn't have done it without her. The food was amazing!! Everyone loved it. And, not to mention the gorgeous venue... If you are looking for a place that offers the ceremony, reception, catering and professionalism all in one you have found it with Casa Real.   
  
Thank you for making my wedding absolutely beautiful

Amazing venue, and service. If you haven't visited Casa Real, you have to. It is beautiful and well worth the price. The staff is wonderful, helpful, and they really help you make the special day not stressful. Alyssia is a wonderful person to work with, and Clay what can I say, he is a great man. All the details were perfect. And I received many compliments from my guests about the staff and the service.

Beautiful place inside and outside of the property. We received many compliments on food portion sizes... they give you so much food and it all tasted GOOD!!!! I am so glad we got married here. The venue inspired my husband's cousin to throw his birthday party here in the future. LOL.

We were married at the Casa Real on April 8,2011 and had an amazing experience. Shannon was our day of coordinator and was so friendly and helpful. She was always available to answer questions and provide suggestions. Everyone that we worked with at Casa was friendly and helpful. The venue is gorgeous and we got a ton of compliments our choice to hold the wedding at Casa. If you are looking for a venue that can accommodate your guests, rain or shine, and is willing to make the experience easy, you should book at Casa!

One of the biggest stressors in wedding planning was trying to secure a venue and a date. I felt overwhelmed with all the options of catering packages and price ranges and all those details. It wasn't until my fiancé and I stepped foot onto the Casa Real property that we felt at ease. We loved all the architecture and the fact that the ballroom didn't have ugly carpet that would clash with our "elegant and romantic" wedding theme. To top it off, the team at Casa has been absolutely amazing. I cannot stress enough how sweet and professional each one of them is despite dealing with brides day in and day out. They really make planning a wedding painless!

Casa Real is a treasure in the heart of the East Bay. We had our ceremony off-site at a church but had we gotten married in the spring-fall timeframe, we would've loved to have our ceremony outside in Casa Real's beautiful sun garden. The staff is very friendly and super helpful. They really do make an effort to make you feel like you're the only wedding that they're concerned with when they're speaking to you. I worked primarily with Alicia, and then Shannon during the day of the wedding and weeks leading up to it. This venue is great for large parties who want to have an intimate feel (they only allow one event per day). The space is very elegant and romantic and doesn't need much dressing up. The staff is super professional and they know how to take care of you and make you feel special. On the day of the wedding, they had champagne and some appetizers ready for the bridal party in the bridal changing room in case we didn't have a chance to eat! Also, the food is magnificent!! Everyone was so shocked at the quality of food (esp. for our large part of 370+!) and still raves about it. Here are the downsides: parking is limited and the basic package only allows you to rent the space for 5 hours (most of the other venues I checked out allowed 6). Also, the event has to end by 10pm on Sundays-Thursdays, and 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays. Overall, awesome venue! We basically revolved our wedding planning (i.e. selecting the church, next available date they had) around making sure we get this place for the reception, but it was WELL worth it.

They are great and very responsive. Everyone is friendly and gets back to you very quickly. Always answers questions and very accommodating. The only thing was for some reason my tables were messed up even after giving a diagram and the adults weren't in the front! However everything else was done very well and would definitely recommend them!

Kara and Zainab at Casa Real were a huge help and they did a great job working with my husband and I. They were very professional on the day of the wedding and Zainab was really good with keeping us on time. My husband is in the the military therefore he was not here for most of the planning of the wedding so the staff at Casa Real really did a great job with helping me plan everything while my husband was away. They were very clear with all of their policies which was a huge help. Also, Kara was really good about offering everything they had to us so we had a few new ideas for our reception because of that. At the rehearsal ceremony, Zainab was amazing and really good at getting my large wedding party in and out of there quickly and efficiently. I highly recommend this venue!

Casa Real helped make my wedding perfect!! I knew I wanted to work with Kara, the main contact person, from the first time I met her. She was so organized, to the point, and knew exactly what she was doing. And it played out that way...every aspect of the wedding planning with them went off like clockwork, email responses within a few minutes, easy to get meeting with them, etc. Our day-of coordinator, Zainab, was similar. She kept our event running. When things would slip she would bring everything back to the plan. I felt like i had everything under control up till the day of the wedding, but on the day of things happened that were out of my control, and Zainab fixed/dealt with everything to make sure I had a perfect wedding.   
The space is also gorgeous! With the entrance, courtyard, main hall, lobby, and Amber Room, there are so many spaces to work with, with different looks for each part of the day. Our pictures came out great against the many different backdrops. Casa Real in its rustic elegance was exactly the look we were going for.

Beautiful Venue 

We absolutely loved this location for our wedding and reception. We had a traditional Indian wedding, a western ceremony and a reception at the end of February 2020. This was literally the last thing we did before we all went into quarantine, and the year hit us all as it currently is.   
  
Let me start with just the ambiance. Every time we walked into this venue, we felt our hearts flutter. This place is just so beautiful and its Mediterranean style layout and pooch friendly atmosphere made this a major selling point for us. We love the sun garden with all of the (lemon trees?) and vines around, and the windows looking out at the vineyards are just so breathtaking.   
  
Next, The staff, and the people who work here are just amazing and exceptional individuals. We had multiple team members on our event since it was more complex. Kara and Nicole were our contact people at first, but then, as time continued we had Nicole and Casey. These ladies are just so professional, sweet, friendly, and have the very special skills to balance bridal craziness and musings with carrying out an organized set of tasks and to-do. Our site visits, tastings, emails, worried calls, were received by these calm ladies.   
  
The food at this venue is by far the best we've tasted as far as wedding food goes. The chicken? Not your typical dry, overcooked breast with a flavorless glaze and potatoes. The fish? not your basic salmon or whitefish with lemon and asparagus. No way. Food was one of our biggest expenses given the innumerable amounts of dietary restrictions, religious restrictions, etc. We did utilize another catering service as well, but from this venue, we offered the chicken- which was a bone-in breast that was baked and in a mornay (sp?) sauce with a side of mac n cheese. Oh my wow. The number of wedding party members and guests we had that raved about the cheese-it topped gouda mac n’ cheese size were countless. Some of my bridesmaids even told me how much I missed out since I had ordered the fish. The fish was the Alaskan cod with mango salsa in a beurre blanc sauce with shaved cabbage. This was by far one of my favorites. The fish was perfectly cooked, not at all fishy in smell like many weddings I’ve been to in the past, and the mango salsa balanced the shaved green and the yummy sauce it came with. This being said, because of our guests and the audience we were needing to cater to, the incorporation and the carrying out of having an outside vendor proved to be much trickier and was not a completely seamless ordeal. We unfortunately ended up spending a lot more on food, and then had guests say that they were not able to experience some of the dishes. We still appreciated that they allowed us to have outside catering alongside their on site catered meals- another major plus, but this was the one area we wished worked out better.  
  
The best part of this venue? We were able to safely and easily incorporate our dog in our wedding festivities.   
  
All in all, as our wedding was an all day affair starting from the wee hours of the morning, this beauty of a venue and the people here made it all the more beautiful and pleasantly possible in creating the best experience for us and our bridal party. We cannot wait to come back to visit Nicole, Casey, and Kara when it is safe for us to do so again.

Casa Real is a great choice for a Bride who may have little control over her wedding from family conflicts. Casa Real has all the basics necessary to make sure that your wedding WILL go seamlessly.  
  
They do review each of your vendors very carefully.  
  
They don't have much flexibility when it comes to decorations.  
  
Their basic options do not match as well as they probably should.
