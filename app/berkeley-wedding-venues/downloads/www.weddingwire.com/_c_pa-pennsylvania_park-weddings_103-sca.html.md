My wedding was at The Mayernik and it was a close to perfect as it could possibly be. Our Wedding Coordinator - Debbie - was so patient, helpful and really made sure our day went off without a hitch. I sent her so many emails leading up to the big day and she was always so responsive and accommodating. She's just the absolute best. The venue itself is beautiful, they have wonderful preferred vendors for catering and a list of vendors they often work with in the event you need suggestions. Our wedding and reception were inside with roughly 107 guests. There is plenty of space with a separate bar area and a great space for the ladies of the bridal party to get ready. Cost is incredibly reasonable with lots of optional add-ons (twinkle lights are a must) and flexibility. My guests (and husband and I), loved this space. I'm sad our day is over but so thankful for the beautiful memories from that venue!

Working with everyone at Camp Starlight was an absolute dream, especially while planning a unique summer camp wedding! From the very beginning, they fully embraced our vision of a weekend filled with outdoor activities, bonfires, and a blend of casual fun with formal celebrations. The camp’s ability to handle all the moving parts of a camp wedding—coordinating everything from water activities to our Wedding Olympics—was nothing short of incredible. Their attention to detail made every moment of our weekend seamless, and they expertly managed the logistics of hosting multiple events across the campgrounds. Whether it was the welcome BBQ, setting up for the bonfire, or transitioning to our formal reception dinner, Robbie, Paris, and the rest of the staff ensured that everything was timed and executed perfectly. What truly sets this venue apart is how they took the time to get to know us and our camp-style vision, tailoring every aspect to make it personal. They made us feel completely at ease, knowing they were always on top of things, allowing us to enjoy every minute of our weekend. Not only were they organized, but their creative ideas and thoughtful suggestions made the weekend more magical than we ever could have imagined. If you’re planning a wedding at a summer camp or any other unique venue, I cannot recommend Camp Starlight highly enough. Thank you, to everyone for making our wedding everything we hoped for and more!

We got married at the Pittsburgh Botanic Garden this September, and couldn't be happier with how everything turned out! We had two main criteria when selecting our venue: 1) it had to be outdoor but with a very solid indoor backup plan (because Pittsburgh weather) and 2) the ceremony had to be pet friendly so we could include our dog. PBG met both of these requirements and and then some!! The venue layout is amazing and accessible, the events team was wonderful to work with and always quick to respond to our questions, and overall everything was just so so beautiful. I highly recommend this venue!

From the moment we visited the facility to the wedding day, Trout Lake has been nothing short of spectacular! Our actual wedding day was phenomenal, which I had no doubt about, but the love and care from the staff throughout the process was incredibly impactful. The staff were oozing with professionalism, the venue is physically breathtaking, and guests are STILL talking about the food (3 weeks later)! Although the team was incredible, Joise and Anna were truly rockstars, and I could not thank them enough for all they've done to help make our wedding the most spectacular and STRESS-FREE day of my life. Also, the Lake House is AWESOME, highly recommend. Thank you to EVERYONE who helped make our day special. Love, Your Bride and Groom (10.12.25)

Tyler Arboretum and JAM catering create such a wonderful wedding planning experience. This venue offers a seriously impressive value for money that can’t be beat. You get so many things included in the per person pricing which takes so much financial stress out of the process! Oh and the food is incredible!

The Manor House was a wonderful experience from start to finish. It was our first venue tour and nothing else compared after this tour. The fairness of pricing and well planned out processes at the manor house made the decision to book even easier. The grounds are beautiful and the numerous ceremony locations provided us with lots of options for our perfect day. The food options were varied and all delicious, our guests all loved the food! Pop, Danielle, and the team were wonderful at communicating during planning and making sure that our day went off without a hitch. There's nothing I would change about our big day and I'm so grateful for the team at Manor House for making it all so special!

The Wheeling Park White Palace staff were absolutely wonderful. They were helpful in planning the details of our reception and professional and thorough in its execution. Dancing was extremely important to us, and the large dance floor accommodated our large reception. Everything was beautiful, and I appreciate all the work that was put into it. I would definitely recommend the White Palace to anyone having a wedding reception or any other large special occasion.
