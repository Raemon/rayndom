I was happy at the service and communication I was provided with. They arrived on time and were very nice and polite. The only thing we had a hicuup in was the microphones for the speeches, which were glitchy, but besides that our dj was great at announcing and playing music. I decided last minute on a lot of things for my wedding and they were very quick to accommodate for me and provide the best service that my husband and I needed. I would definitely recommend.

Where do I start?! We got married about three weeks ago and I am still thinking about how much fun we had all thanks to Chase aka DJ Dawn Patrol! He was so personable and was always available to answer any questions we had! He was also attentive to our needs and wishes and ensured that our vision came to life. He kept the energy high and did not skip a beat and our guests all raved about how fun he was. Being a wedding dj is not an easy job but Chase more than delivered! Chase’s price was very reasonable and I love that you can customize your experience with various equipment like lasers if your venue allowed. Thank you so much for a memorable time and would hire him again in a heartbeat!!

We couldn’t have asked for a better wedding DJ! He absolutely nailed the vibe from start to finish—smooth transitions, perfect song choices, and the dance floor was packed all night. Professional, fun, and incredibly easy to work with. Our guests are still talking about how great the music was. Highly recommend!

As a young couple who will dance all night if you let them, Marcel at NightShift Sounds was a perfect fit for our wedding. The music was perfect, the sound was clear, & everything flowed exactly how we envisioned it. Marcel was extremely easy to work with, & super flexible with us when we decided to add more time to our contract. We truly had the best experience, & will forever recommend him to anyone we come across.

I have experience in this area and I have very high expectations. We used MS DJ Events for my daughter’s reception and they exceeded our expectations! The service and preparation from their team leading up to the event was fantastic and the DJ was fantastic! Truly a huge part of making the wedding a fun and memorable one!

George was absolutely one of our favorite vendors from our wedding, and we had an amazing team of vendors! From the moment we booked him a year ago, he was incredibly easy to work with. One of the top things I was looking for was a DJ who could also MC, and I was so fortunate to be referred to George. As someone who does stand-up comedy on the side, he had no trouble getting the crowd excited and engaged. George took the time to understand what we wanted as a couple, but he also offered great suggestions based on what works well at weddings, always respecting our vision. We had a non-traditional wedding in New Orleans, which required a lot of coordination, and George made sure everything went smoothly. And let me tell you, everything flowed perfectly. What really stands out about George is that he makes decisions with your best interests in mind, and you can trust him to handle things when necessary. I had a very specific playlist and requested that guests not make song requests, and George made sure everyone knew that our preferences were the priority. The guests couldn’t stop raving about him. If I could, I’d hire George over and over again. He was truly outstanding. Sincerely, One happy bride, Jessica Huynh

One of my favorite things is music and no event is truly fun or a party without it. Ron is a true expert in his field! He kept things rolling smoothly by not playing the whole songs for the first dances. There was never one awkward moment. He kept everyone on the dance floor with his music selections. He was able to give clear directions to the wedding guests and when we forgot to pick a departing song after the ceremony he never missed a beat and played the perfect song for us!!!!!! That is where his experience showed up. He was never frantic or asking me tons of questions but just handled everything like it was so simple. Ron is the exact kind of person I WANT around me during stressful times. Some people make things difficult and some make it effortlessly and that was Ron. We had the best time celebrating all that God has done in our lives. That was so easy to do with Ron!!!

We hired Richard based on a referral. We couldn't be any happier with his expertise. He made our whole event one to remember. All of our friends and family are still talking about it. If you need a dj/MC Richard defintally is the one for you. We will continue to use him in the future and refer him to everyone we know. Thank you so much Richard for being out DJ!
