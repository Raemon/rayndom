Carawood was an incredible place to host a wedding. The lodge sits in a beautiful natural setting, with the lake and trees creating a serene backdrop that felt both warm and inviting. As the sun set, guests gathered around a big bonfire, and the kids loved roasting s’mores—it gave the whole evening a cozy, unforgettable touch. Inside, the lodge had just the right lighting and ambiance to make the space feel elegant yet comfortable. The dance floor was lively all night, and everyone commented on how perfect the atmosphere was for celebrating. It truly brought together the best of the outdoors and a welcoming lodge-style charm.

The Venue The venue itself is stunning year round. Words can't do justice to how gorgeous the building and grounds are. We had spent months looking at other venues beforehand, but nothing even came close. The property has a history and story to it as well, which we can definitely appreciate. It feels secluded with trees and foliage surrounding it on all sides and the mansion is unreal. This place is a hidden gem. The Staff Lisa Ferraro is just the best. She is so kind, insightful, proactive, and all-around fantastic at what she does. We'd spent a good amount of time getting to know her on the first day that we toured and everything just clicked. We had great, fun conversations and felt so much more relaxed about our wedding knowing that this was it. She connected us with the best vendors (shout out to Matt the DJ with Seamless Sounds!), went out of her way to accommodate the accessibility needs of our guests, and asked all the right questions to keep our wedding planning on track. She truly went above and beyond to make sure our wedding went perfectly and we can't say enough great things about her! The rest of the staff nailed it too-- the setup day-of looked beautiful and teardown went flawlessly.

Bingham Meadows and Roger Bingham were the highlight of my wedding! Roger was so accommodating and sweet; he made sure everything was perfect and gave plenty of time for set up. The venue is beautiful and the perfect setting for someone looking to have a rustic, yet glamourous wedding atmosphere! It’s newly built and was amazingly priced. Can’t say enough!

Having my wedding at the Groesbeck Estate last October was the best decision I ever had and I can't recommend it enough. Amazing intimate location nestled away with breathtaking views of the surrounding forest! The inside of the Estate was restored with a great bridal suite that allowed for a lot of natural light in. I had always wanted to get married outside during in October but with the way Cincinnati weather can be unpredictable, I needed a venue that would allow for me to have a weather safety net if needed - which the Estate did have by having an all weather tent up on the back-terrace. I could not have had a perfect wedding day if it wasn't for Julie, the Rental and Event Manager. Julie was absolutely amazing to work with and was so helpful the entire way through. She was easygoing and professional from the start, and had always made us feel like a priority even though I knew she was handling a lot of other couples at the same time! I would recommend the Groesbeck Estate to any couple looking for a beautiful venue to celebrate their big day or or anyone searching for a venue for a special event.

Franklin Park is one of the most beautiful wedding venues. We got married in early November in the Palm House and our friends and family are still raving about how beautiful the space is. From the very beginning Taylor was SO responsive and sweet, answering my 100s of questions throughout the planning process. Sarah kept up the same level of customer service as we neared wedding day. We truly appreciate how helpful the whole team was in the planning process. Even though there was an event at the conservatory at the same time, the team did a great job keeping the public out of our reserved spaces. I know they have renovations planned for the Palm House so I can't speak to the future of the space, but it was the best decision I made in the wedding planning process. Highly recommend.

The most beautiful place in the area. The price is a great value. The only negative was the set up for the sweethearts table, they set it up where we were hitting our knees into the table poles. They should have set it up where they weren’t where we were sitting.

What an absolute joy to work with Hines Hill for our wedding. Not only is the venue/property stunning, but the value is unreal! They allow access the day before for setup which is very generous and allows for day of setup to be minimal. The property has a beautiful tent with wooden beams along with a great barn (we utilized for appetizers/cocktail reception and then for dessert) and also 2 buildings which was useful for bridal parties getting ready on-site the day of. The grounds allowed for lots of places to hang out with a fire pit in the evening. The weather cooperates and made for the perfect day where guests could enjoy all the beautiful property had to offer. The communication with Haley and the team from floor plans, general questions, and recommendations was exceptional. Site visit before made everything come together. Truly cannot speak highly enough about Haley - she is positive and so very helpful. She made the entire process a breeze. Day of there was staff available if we needed help with anything. I still can’t get over what a great value it was and how much money we saved by being able to utilize offsite catering and purchase our own alcohol for the event (shout out to thirsty filly too!) not to mention to get married in a National Park and know that our money is helping fund the NPS. Highly recommend.

My husband and I hosted our wedding at Happy Days Lodge on May 10, 2025. There are a lot of fantastic wedding venues sprinkled across northeast ohio, but now that it’s all said and done, I couldn’t imagine having my wedding anywhere else. From the very beginning the staff was incredibly helpful, competent, professional, and genuinely excited to be working with us. I know event centers/venues host multiple wedding a weekend, but the team at Happy Days really made us feel like we were throwing a once in a lifetime event. They put some much care and attention into helping us get organized and bring our vision for the day to life. I was especially impressed by their service since we were planning our wedding from out of state and had to do almost all of our coordination virtually. I would recommend anyone looking for a natural setting to host their event with the conservancy for CVNP. Our guests loved staying in close proximity to the park and getting to explore the trails and waterfalls nearby before and after the wedding. Happy Days is partnered with a number of vendors that tailor their services to a variety of budgets. We were able to find an excellent caterer that fit with our budget from their list of approved caterers. We also used a few of their recommended (but not required) vendors for other services. Lastly, we utilized their Bar service and found it took a lot of the guesswork and DIY labor out of providing alcohol for our reception at a fairly reasonable price. As far as decor goes, the natural setting of the venue, the old wood interior, and the gorgeous string lights, stage lights, and chandeliers left very little work for us to do other than to put finishing touches on the venue on the day of the ceremony and reception. We added some florals and battery tea light candles to the reception tables, decorated the foyer tables, and added florals, lights, and fabrics to the ceremony space and that was it. We arrived to the venue around 1 pm and were able to set up and take all of our formal photos before our ceremony started at 5pm. Our reception ended at 11pm and my family and bridal party had finished removing our decor and left to go home by 11:30pm.

We held our ceremony outdoor in the 'Chapel' right next to our reception held in the Lodge. Pyramid Hill let us have full flexibility with the design of the space both outdoor and inside; the bar package was easily negoitiated. Sasha was fairly easy to work with and I would completely recommend this space for weddings under 50.

There aren’t enough words to describe how happy we are that we got married at the zoo. Emma from the Zoo and Mary from Aramark were an absolute joy to work with - very accommodating, professional, understanding, and responsive. Highly recommend getting married at the zoo if you want a unique/fun venue or even just a beautiful place! We love the outdoors and wanted to get married somewhere fun – mission accomplished! It’s been over a month since we got married and our guests are STILL raving about how much fun they had, how delicious the food was, how incredible and unique the experience was, and praise the staff. Logistics were a big deal for us. With a lot of guests, some with mobility issues, we wanted to make things as easy for our guests as possible. Having the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception at one location took a huge burden off of us and it was one of the best decisions we made. Guests that had mobility issues felt well taken care of and could easily navigate the space, and the staff treated everyone like gold. There was one small issue with the last tram up breaking down part way through the trip before the ceremony, but the staff remained in contact with each other and handled it without us having to stress/worry. Mary and the Aramark staff were fantastic to work with. Mary replied promptly to all of our questions, countless “what if” inquiries and requests about allergies, was gracious about any and all accommodations and changes and so much more. We had a plated meal for 200 guests and everyone was served in a timely manner with delicious meals well executed. The contract also included linens, china, silverware, etc. so having a one-stop-shop for that took away a LOT of additional contracts/stress. With a lot of different allergies, some severe – they took the time to understand each of them and accommodate everyone which went a long way with our guests. They often times go places and have to bring their own items, and to be included/accommodated meant a lot to them! Emma was an absolute dream to work with and her staff was amazing. The Zoo will assign a day-of coordinator and Emma went above and beyond to make the day special for us, and take as much stress off of us as possible leading up to the wedding. From accommodating separate visits to the venue to help alleviate stress/anxieties that our parents, officiant, baker, etc. had – I can’t imagine other places handling it with such grace and poise. They also set up our place cards, centerpieces, chairs for the ceremony, tables/chairs for the reception, etc. that we (and our family and friends) could just focus on what we wanted to that day – it was a huge relief and help. From hearing the lion roar during our ceremony, to riding the carousel during happy hour, or exploring the Asian lantern festival and being in the beautiful Stillwater, we loved all of it (as did our guests). Great value for the cost and amazing people to work with. We love the zoo and are so happy that our guests now love the zoo, too.
