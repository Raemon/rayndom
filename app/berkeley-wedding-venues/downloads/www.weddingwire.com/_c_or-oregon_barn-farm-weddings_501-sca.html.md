Coming from Klamath Falls, we were looking for a venue that felt unique, and Umbrella Farms is that place. The property is absolutely gorgeous and very photogenic. They have lush plants and landscaping which wandering around the grounds a highlight for us and our guests. It felt like a private, special estate for our wedding day. We utilized both the indoor and outdoor spaces, which are designed perfectly for a seamless flow. We enjoyed the farm local ingredients with catering—the farm pizza and salad were delicious and fit the relaxed, high-quality vibe we wanted. Logistically, this place is a win. Its location on Oceanview Drive is beautiful, around oceanfront homes. Umbrella Farms has excellent parking and is close to local hotels, which made things so much easier for our traveling guests. We’re already planning our return trips next Summer. We can’t wait to come back for their Saturday Market to listen to live music with the community and reminisce about our wedding day. We definitely recommend Umbrella Farms for anyone looking for a perfect wedding destination.

Our wedding weekend at Scholls Valley Lodge was nothing short of magical. From the moment we arrived, we were enveloped in the venue's enchanting atmosphere, and the beautifully maintained grounds. The venue itself is breathtaking. Nestled in Oregon’s wine country, SVL offers a perfect blend of natural beauty and elegant sophistication. The grounds are meticulously maintained, providing a stunning backdrop for our ceremony and reception. Every corner of the property is picture-perfect, which made our wedding photos truly extraordinary. What truly set SVL apart was the ability to stay on the property for the entire weekend. This feature turned our wedding into a delightful mini-vacation for us and our guests. The accommodations were luxurious and comfortable, allowing everyone to relax and enjoy themselves. The rooms were spacious, beautifully decorated, and equipped with all the amenities we could ask for. We even had a welcome dinner on one of the nights with all of our guests (120) and it was so convenient to hang out, play lawn games and not have to coordinate with a different venue, decorations, etc. Having our family and friends close by throughout the weekend created a warm and intimate atmosphere. We had ample time to catch up, celebrate, and create lasting memories together. The staff went above and beyond to ensure we felt welcomed and well taken care of, attending to every detail with professionalism and genuine care. We also took advantage of the venue's various amenities, such as giant lawns for lawn games, pool table, wrap around porch with rocking chairs, a fully stocked kitchen, which added to the overall enjoyment of our stay. Whether we were exploring the grounds, relaxing in our rooms, or celebrating with loved ones, every moment was perfect. We are so grateful to SVL for providing us with an unforgettable wedding weekend. It was everything we dreamed of and more. We highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a magical, all-inclusive wedding experience. Thank you for making our special day so incredibly special!

We’ve had the pleasure of working multiple weddings at Coleman Ranch over the past few years, and every experience has been top-notch. The ceremony and reception spaces are thoughtfully laid out, making it easy for us to provide great sound and keep the celebration flowing. The scenery is beautiful, the staff is incredibly helpful, and it’s always a smooth and enjoyable day for couples and vendors alike. Highly recommend!

Oak & Hood is a wonderful and beautiful venue. Kelsey Belden was very welcoming and provided prompt and direct communication in the lead up to our event. There was plenty of space for everyone, and plenty of parking. The bathrooms were top tier in cleanliness and were nicely updated. They provided chairs and tables which were essential. The staff was thoughtful and helpful for any of our needs. After the event, our guests told us they loved the venue and would highly recommend it!

We got married this last month at Black Butte Ranch and could not have been happier with the day. The Black Butte Sales Manager & Event Specialist are top notch, responsive, and extremely helpful in getting the day where we wanted. Not to mention their entire team guiding the transition of the event space made our 160 person wedding a breeze. The venue's vista is unparalleled and they were able to keep the streets and walkways shoveled and travelable for our event. Thank you Black Butte Ranch Team and we can't wait to be back in the future!
