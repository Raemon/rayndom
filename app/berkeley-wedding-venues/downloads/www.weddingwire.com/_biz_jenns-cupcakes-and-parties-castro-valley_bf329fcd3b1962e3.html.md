Hire her now! Best cupcakes ever.

Jenn is FABULOUS! Her cupcakes are the BEST ones I've ever had. She is so kind, sweet, hard working, and made our day so special with her attention to detail. She has endless options for cake flavors and frostings, too. I can't give her high enough praise!

Pretty in Pearls

Jenn’s Cupcakes and Parties helped us through every step of the way of our wedding festivities. They executed and delivered the most amazing cupcakes for both my bridal shower and bachelorette! No words can describe how amazing our wedding day was because of them. I had a vision of a beautiful wedding cake covered in pearls which they put on by hand. They also added the sweetest touch of a little fondant replica of our beloved puppy at the base of our cake. As if they couldn’t have done any more, they also made decadent flavored cupcakes for our wedding guests. The desserts as a whole looked like something straight out of a bridal magazine. I highly recommend this company for any bride, looking for some tasty treats for her wedding day. I certainly plan to use them again for all my future special occasions.

Best cakes and cupcakes!

As a wedding photographer, I taste a LOT of baked goods. It's a nice benefit, but it's the BEST when I get to eat one of Jenn's Cupcakes and Parties yummy goodies. Jenn's cupcakes are always delicious, marvelously decorated and are rarely left behind! Jenn is a delight to work with and her passion for the highest quality is unparalleled. Do yourself and your guests a huge favor and order Jenn's yummy treats for your wedding or event!
