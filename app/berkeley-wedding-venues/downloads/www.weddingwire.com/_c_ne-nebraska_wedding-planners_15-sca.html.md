Absolutely unreal (in the best possible way) service!! Dorée Events, the lovely Jaydon and Zaya, was probably the best vendor we could've picked for our day! Our venue actually required that we hire a Day of Coordinator and we were super hesitant on looking for one, but we absolutely struck gold with this one! Our wedding truly would not have been the same with Jaydon and her team. From Zoom calls, to the perfect timeline, to picturesque set up, running miscellaneous things here and there, they were an absolute gem! We would recommend them to anyone planning an event in a heartbeat, because they made the most special day of our lives the MOST special!! (Photographer: Lacy Marie)

We cannot say enough wonderful things about Lexi! She helped so much the with the planning process by keeping us on track and providing wonderful resources and insight. On wedding day, from start to finish, she made everything run absolutely seamlessly. We didn’t have to worry about a single thing during set-up as she had every detail under control, allowing us to be fully present and enjoy the moment. Her willingness to hop on a call, answer a text at any hour, and calm any nerves along the way meant the world to us. She handled all communication with our vendors with such ease and professionalism, completely lifting the stress off our shoulders. Every interaction with her was kind, thoughtful, and reassuring. Our wedding day truly would not have run the way it did without her. We are endlessly grateful for her dedication, organization, and calming presence.

Working with 402 Events for our wedding was one of the BEST decisions we have ever made - I would do it again a million times over. There is no way we would have been able to execute our vision without their help and expertise, and I could not imagine the day without them! This team truly went above and beyond to make our day the most special - their attention to detail is remarkable and they made EVERYTHING on my wish list come to life. Their list of recommended vendors was a huge help, and played such a big part in executing our vision - every choice was curated perfectly to us. The whole process went so smoothly, and the wedding day itself was absolutely magical - I seriously felt like a princess. 402 Events was able to help us navigate tough decisions when it came to our budget. The ideas we ultimately couldn't fit in the budget were met with alternative cost-friendly options that were equally as beautiful. Walking into the reception room for our 'room reveal' before guests arrived is something I will never forget. Every little detail we had worked on and discussed for a year was executed PERFECTLY, even more than I was expecting. I honestly was a bit sad when the wedding ended because I enjoyed working with the 402 team so much, I didn't want it to end! They seriously made us feel like family. Could not recommend them more if you are planning a wedding or any event!

Loved this bridal show. We had such a great time and it was one of the biggest we were able to find with multiple vendors for each category. We had such a great time planning and everyone we ran into was very professional and helpful. They also served liquor and mimosas when we went which made it a little easier for those that weren't quite ready to start planning.

I hired Event Design for my wedding on April 2nd, 2016 (Sorry Shelly for my late review! I feel awful!) Where do I start...lets just say I nicknamed Shelly as my "wedding angel" ;) Shelly and her team are AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING! I enjoyed working with Shelly so much! She is so very knowledgeable in the event industry! We hired Event Design to decorate Chez Hay, so they did the set up and tear down of all decorations. The room was breathe taking!!! We got so many compliments from our guests. I also hired her for Day of Coordination. Every bride needs a Day of Coordinator. I don't know what I would have done without Shelly by my side that day! Shelly, you are amazing! Our wedding turned out exactly what we imagined and it could not have happened without your EXCELLENT HARD WORK! Thank you again for who you are and what you do! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVENT DESIGN! A+ WORK!
