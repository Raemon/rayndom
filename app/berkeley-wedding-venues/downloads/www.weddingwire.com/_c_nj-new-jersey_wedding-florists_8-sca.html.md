Sandra helped us with our wedding ceremony flowers. She is very talented, crafted the flowers that are beautifully and professionally done. She found me my favorite peony as my bouquet even it is not in season! Highly recommended.

Marcy from South Jersey Florists was an absolute joy to work with! She was incredibly communicative from the start, really listened to our ideas and wedding style, and brought everything to life even more beautifully than we could have imagined. The bouquets and centerpieces were truly stunning. Marcy was thoughtful, kind, and so flexible when we had a few changes to our wedding party and guest count, which we greatly appreciated. The quality of her work was amazing - the centerpieces lasted for a full week after the wedding and still looked beautiful. We loved working with her and couldn’t recommend her more highly to anyone looking for a talented and caring florist!!

We knew we didn’t want to spend a ridiculous amount of money on florals for the day of the wedding without sacrificing quality and creating something that added a little extra beauty to the day. When we first met with Elyse, we showed her inspiration pictures with the general vision of what we were looking for for florals. She listened and gave suggestions of what she thought would work the best for us and our venue. MPS has table decorations for rent too so besides the flowers, they also provided all the hurricane candles for the table centerpieces. Elyse was also able to use a bouquet wrap and pieces of my mom’s veil/headpiece from her wedding in my bouquet in such a beautiful way. The flowers also didn’t die for a while after the wedding was over once they were put back in water. Elyse was so easy to work with, helpful with any questions we had and responded quickly to any emails we sent.

I couldn’t have been happier with my florist, Marquis Florals, whom I chose for my wedding. The tall centerpieces were absolutely stunning and elegant, exactly what I had envisioned, and they truly transformed the reception space. The bouquets were beautiful, fresh, and perfectly designed, complementing the day flawlessly. The chapel looked breathtaking — it felt warm, romantic, and so thoughtfully arranged. Every detail was handled with care and creativity, and the flowers exceeded my expectations. I received so many compliments from guests. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for exceptional floral design for a special occasion. Thank you, Kim and Francesca, for making my dream come true.

I honestly had no idea what I wanted when I sat down with Michael and Eden to discuss wedding flowers. I knew what colors the girls were wearing and that I wanted a big, cascading bouquet like my mom had when she got married, but other than that I was at a loss. Michael took his time showing me different ideas and then gave us several options to determine our budget. The day of the wedding, everything was even more beautiful than I could have ever imagined. We got so many compliments on the florals, from the bouquets to the centerpieces. Highly, highly, recommend Cook's!

We just wanted to send a huge thank you to the team for the absolutely beautiful decor and flowers during our wedding. They were elegant, just the right size for the occasion and done with so much finesse. We also appreciated how communication and logistics were so smooth and effortless from A to Z and communication was always clear and on point.

We worked with Denise and her team and Leigh Florals for our September wedding, and everything turned out so beautiful! Denise was so easy to work with, making the whole process stress free. We initially chose to work with them because they had done a similar floral piece at our venue that I wanted, and I don’t regret our choice! Throughout the night we kept getting compliments on how beautiful our arrangements were and it was all thanks to Denise and her team. She took our vision and ran with it. We also rented our chuppah through them, and they set everything up and stayed to break it down and transfer our flowers over to our reception space. We didn’t have to think about a thing throughout our wedding because we knew we could trust them to get everything done.
