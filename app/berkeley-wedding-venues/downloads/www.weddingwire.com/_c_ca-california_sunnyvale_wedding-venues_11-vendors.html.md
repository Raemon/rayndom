We had an exceptional experience hosting our daughter’s wedding at this venue. From start to finish, the management and staff were professional, respectful, highly responsive, and extremely prompt. They honored every contractual commitment and were flexible whenever possible, making the entire planning process smooth and stress-free. What truly stood out was their understanding of the pressure and emotions involved in a wedding. They ensured that every detail—venue setup, hall, chairs, tables, buffet arrangements, and food—was delivered exactly as agreed. The owners were always actively involved, closely monitoring everything to ensure the event’s success, which gave us great peace of mind. One of the most impressive and memorable gestures was when the owner, Arunji, personally ensured that the chef we had originally agreed upon was secured—even though the chef had already moved on. Thanks to Arunji for bringing back Chef Mani! The food was absolutely excellent, and even today our wedding guests continue to talk about how delicious it was. That says everything. A special shout-out to Manager Manoj for his coordination and support throughout. We are truly grateful to the entire team for making our daughter’s wedding such a beautiful and memorable celebration. Highly recommended without hesitation!

Ginger Cafe catered our wedding at a Golf Course. My hubby and I wanted to have the best of both worlds: good and plenty of food but a beautiful venue. Everyone else we found did not offer the 8 course meal we were used to or only buffet style with the food cooked off-site. When we found Ginger Cafe on Wedding Wire and Yelp, they seemed to offer everything we were looking for: a selection of 8 courses and freshly cooked food! The raving reviews brought us one of the managers Bo. Our venue had never used an outside caterer before but Bo was responsive and experienced, after the venue coordinators spoke w/ Bo they felt comfortable in giving outside catering a try. He assured us his team would be able to set up their kitchen outside as long as there was water and electricity access. Bo was even able to accommodate a tasting for just by hubby and I (since it was still during early covid). We did a tasting at their Sunnyvale location to solidify a menu choice. We loved that the food was familiar but also has contemporary twists. My hubby and I LOVE to eat and we knew Ginger Cafe could supply a meal that our guests never had at a traditional wedding. We later brought our parents and they loved the food as well. Bo and chef Tuyen took critique well and were able to make some adjustments and special requests to accommodate our parent’s preferences along with ours. Bo was a pleasure to work with throughout the planning process and was always quick to respond when I was in venue meetings to answer any questions. We that felt he was always in our corner and advocating for us. He encouraged us to try all their food before our wedding knowing we would not have much time the day of. Even though our schedule was packed his team always tried their best to feed us. They also packed up our meal so we could enjoy it when we got home. Everything went smoothly with our wedding and our families and friends were thoroughly impressed. HIRE GINGER CAFE IF YOU LOVE GOOD FOOD AND WANT TO WOW EVERYONE!
