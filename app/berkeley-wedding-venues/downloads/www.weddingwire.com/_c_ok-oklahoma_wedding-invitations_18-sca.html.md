Tara at TA Designs designed my invitations from scratch based a picture I found that I liked. She was able to make suggestions to me about how to word my invitations, but also wanted my input so that the style would be totally my fiance's and mine. She also downloaded a map from our venue website and made a much prettier version of it to slip inside our envelopes. I recieved many compliments on the design. She also provided me with "day of" coordinating services. I did not hire a wedding planner so her help was greatly appreciated. She completely ran our rehearsal and coordinated with the entire wedding party and vendors on my wedding day, which went off without a hitch. She is young and fun and knows what she is talking about. I loved her!
