Taya is an amazing wedding officiant! From the moment we started working with her, we knew we were in good hands.

Taya was always available and responsive, addressing every question and concern we had with patience and a genuine desire to make our day perfect. Her warm personality and professionalism truly shone through, and we couldn't have asked for a better person to help us tie the knot!

Choosing Mary to be our wedding officiant was one of the best choices we made! From start to finish Mary was there, getting to know us and how we wanted our ceremony to go. She kept in communication with us throughout the planning process which was so helpful! We would recommend Mary to any soon to be newlyweds!

Rev. Giz was truly incredible! To be honest, we had no clue how to plan/ formulate our ceremony and it’s one of the things I completely put on the back burner. Rev. Giz has an entire outline of the ceremony and you get to customize it however you’d like. We met him at our rehearsal, so the evening before our wedding and honestly it felt like we’d been friends for years. He is very personable, funny but also professional. I wouldn’t even think twice- he is your guy!

Lorraine was amazing. She adds so much personal love into a very professional service. She makes all your guests feel comfortable. Whatever you want for a service, Lorraine makes it happen. Lorraine performed our wedding ceremony and also a Celebration of Life for a dear friend of ours. Both were filled with love and personal touches. If you want an amazing service, count on Lorraine.

Rabbi Shari is a warm and friendly woman who strives to make a ceremony that speaks to you personally. My daughter’s wedding, last week, pleased my Jewish daughter, my non-Jewish son-in-law, and family members in both sides. A miracle!!

Reverend Patricia was a great asset to our wedding. She was very easy to communicate with. She was friendly and a great help in writing the perfect vows for us. She was also very flexible regarding a time change we had to make. We would definitely recommend her. Sean & Jeanaye

Jim was very helpful and did a great job on our ceremony. The only thing I was unhappy with was who signed my marriage license, but I did not let him know my wishes...I had wanted our two closest friends to sign and had told them that, but somehow my father in law and sister in law ended up signing. This was definitely not Jim's fault, I only bring it up so future brides will let Jim know their intentions! Thanks for a great day Jim!

Rev. Lauren Press was perfect for our civil union (which was also Rev. Press's) first as well! She joined two couples at the Delaware OneLove event on 1/7/12 and couldn't have been more perfect for the job!
