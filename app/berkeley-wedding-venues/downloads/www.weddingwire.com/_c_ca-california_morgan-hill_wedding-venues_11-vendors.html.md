We had the most amazing wedding in July here at Willow Heights Mansion!!! Our day was beyond perfect. Everything from the planning process to the day of the wedding went so smoothly thanks to all of the vendors and especially our coordinator Christina!! We were so nervous leading up to the wedding day, but once we met Christina during our rehearsal we knew she would do an incredible job. She made sure to update us throughout our wedding day, kept track of all of our guests, made sure we had a meal/drink ready at our sweetheart table waiting for us after our ceremony and kept checking in with us to make sure we didn’t need anything else. She kept us on track and on time for everything throughout the whole day. I didn’t have to worry about a single thing. I could not recommend this venue and Christina enough!! We cannot thank this team enough for making our day so special and memorable❤️

I'm a professional wedding photographer and I've recently shot a wedding at Granada Ballroom. It's a great venue for weddings. The overall atmosphere, picturesque spots, and very helpful staff members play a huge success for any couple and create a magical moment for photographers. I can't wait to go back and do it again!

From the moment we first toured MOHI Ranch, we knew we had found the perfect venue for our wedding day. Looking back, we can honestly say that the entire experience, from initial planning to the final send-off, exceeded every expectation. The setting itself is simply magical. We had our ceremony in the vineyard with the olive tree aisle and it was perfect. Even in early November, the vines were lush with slight Fall tones. The outdoor reception under the olive trees and lights felt like a scene from a movie—it’s naturally gorgeous and requires very little added decor. As the sun set, the entire winery transformed under the twinkling bistro lights. This feature alone creates such a romantic and special atmosphere that guests are still raving about. A massive part of our success was our coordinator, Danika. She was absolutely fantastic! Danika walked us through the entire process with expertise, kept us perfectly on track with our timeline, and answered every single one of our questions (no matter how small or frequent). The planning process was seamless, enhanced by the specialized services MOHI provides. We were thrilled to use the design service through Lux Designs, which helped us finalize our vision for decor. The tasting menu experience was also wonderful, allowing us to confidently choose our menu while enjoying a date night out. The food was fantastic! We received countless compliments from our guests, who told us how much they enjoyed every dish. The quality and presentation were superb, and there was plenty for everyone. If you are looking for a venue that combines natural elegance, exceptional service, and delicious catering, look no further than MOHI Ranch. They gave us the most special and memorable day of our lives!

We absolutely LOVED having our wedding here. The winery itself is beautiful, romantic, and rustic. The staff were incredibly friendly, personable, and so easy to work with. We 100% recommend Guglielmo to all future bride and grooms as the ideal venue, both for the excellent customer service, gorgeous pictures, and sweet memories!

Some might say that the inside of this little church might be dated, and maybe they're right. I remember thinking that should they choose to replace the carpet with wood floors, it would be nicer. However, I do love, love, love this church! Working with Jeannie was a dream. She responded quickly to emails and phone calls, and when faced with a rowdy bunch (sorry Jeannie!) at the rehearsal, she was more than just a little patient. The wedding ceremony was not perfect, but it was very us, and I would not hesitate to say that this lovely church had a lot to do with it. Everyone loved the homey and simple look to it, and I gotta say that ringing the bell after getting married was really fun, too!

We spent two years looking for a place that had the feeling we were looking for in a wedding venue. While we didn’t want a traditional or cramped feel something that would lend a formal feel was important, and we had a budget to stay within! We visited and came back to Castillo’s because of their wine, their red’s are very good! We became members there because the Castillo family was so welcoming and personable to us. We decided to get married there because their outdoor venue is absolutely lovely, while still being intimate, and perfect for a wedding of 45 to 120 people, and our guest list of 98 was perfectly happy with lots of elbow room at the delightful location. One of the owners, RoniJo Castillo acted as our onsite coordinator for our two meetings leading up to the event, the rehearsal and on the day of the wedding. When there were questions, she was responsive and attentive to us, often giving us good direction. She and her team were top notch and she personally made our wedding as successful as it was due to her caring and interaction with us and our vendors, to ensure that the day came off without a hitch. She handled the set up of not only the dining portion, but the pre ceremony activities, wine tasting / cocktail hour for our guest while we were off taking pictures around the property, and transitions between all parts of the day. The other owner, Jess Castillo her husband, handled all the catering/cooking, leading a team in their outdoor kitchen for the event. Tri-tip, chicken, salads, pizza oven duties all onsite and supplying wine o’plenty made for a great “One stop shopping” venue for our wedding. The Castillo's showed attention and caring that I don't think can be found at other venues, because other venues aren't someones home, quite often it's just a location for an event. Looking back, I am sure that I wouldn't have gone anywhere else! We are already talking about having our five year anniversary party there.

We used Mama Mia's as the caterer for our wedding at Kirigin Cellars (they are a preferred vendor for Kirigin), and we also had our rehearsal lunch there the day before (at the Morgan Hill restaurant). The food for both meals was solid--we had their BBQ for the rehearsal (ribs were delicious!) and their Italian buffet for the wedding reception. I would say the food was good but not 'gourmet'. Where Mama Mia's really shines is their value (very cost effective for what you get) and their service. Shawna, the catering manager, is incredibly on top of things. We also hired her as our day-of coordinator for the wedding, which she will discount if Mama Mia's does the catering, and it was the most valuable money we spent for the entire wedding. She was responsive via email and really aware of everything goes on and what needed doing, and was great about coordination set up and break down the day of. She and the rest of her staff were all friendly, organized, and on top of everything.

Daryl & I celebrated our wedding at light post, Sofia and her staff were more than helpful and made our experience memorable. Our guests were impressed on how everything was organized and coordinated. When I arrived there was a wonderful room for me to change into my wedding dress, it was decorated with a beautiful bouquet of roses, glass of wine and appetizers I felt very special. All in all, the day couldn't have gone better. We highly recommend them! We really appreciated the great service and great attitude at the Light Post!

We could not rave about our venue more! We got married in September at Carrington Manor and have since received compliment after compliment about the venue. Our coordinator said it had the best flow of a venue in the Bay Area that they’ve ever worked with. There were different areas for the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception which made things flow well and guests knew where to be. We hardly needed florals considering the greenery on the estate was stunning and came out beautifully in our pictures! The inside barn area for dancing worked so well with our band as well. There was beautiful lighting already supplied by the venue and they were amazing to work with!
