Kathleen did an amazing job for us at our wedding. From the beginning she was quick to respond and made the process so easy. We appreciated this so much as wedding planning can be overwhelming with all the planning and details. Very professional and just absolutely beautiful. It was my wish to have the violin being played for our ceremony and she did an amazing job. When I was walking in her music just filled the air with such a warmth and peaceful feeling. She took care of any issues with timing of the procession and made it flawless. My daughter plays the violin and she told me how amazing of a job she did with that and in how she handled it. She did a great job making that moment for me and my husband magical. Everyone said how absolutely beautiful our wedding was with having her play for us. She added that special sparkle. I am very happy that I found her on here and picked her to play the violin for our ceremony. Thank you Kathleen! Thank you for being a part of our celebration and for giving us wonderful memories!

When planning our 50th anniversary party, my husband was adamant about having a string quartet. We booked the Shrewsbury String Quartet and were so glad we did. It took our event at Heritage Shores to another level. It was so elegant and lovely. Our guests just loved it. Tony is such a pleasure to work with, so responsive and accommodating. A wonderful experience!

Andrea does a beautiful job singing for weddings, therefore, I hire her whenever possible. She is highly trained as a classical singer but has such a versatile voice that she is able to sing a wide range of repertoire; from broadway hits, to musical theatre, popular songs and of course anything classical (operetta and opera). Not only is she a superb vocalist, but she is extremely easy to work with and totally reliable. Andrea is a joy to both hear and to see! Karen Ahramjian, Cellist/Owner Wilmington String Ensemble

We hired Greta and Matthew to perform our ceremony music at our wedding at the Petit Social. They were amazing to work with, made recommendations for songs that we absolutely loved, and added a beautiful touch to our intimate ceremony. Matt has an ethereal voice and his singing was just beautiful. I can't recommend this so enough!

Amazing!!! We hired Sean to perform at our wedding reception and the guests loved it!! We wanted something different for our wedding since everybody does photo booths these days. Since we were aiming for a 40's/50's feel and my husband is a Sinatra fan we figured a liver performer was the best way. After reaching out to a few performers and watching videos, we felt that Sean sounded just like Sinatra so we hired him to perform during cocktail hour and dinner service. He was on time, professional, and a great performer. He had all my guests into it. I would highly recommend Sean!

We hired Devin to play during cocktail hour at our wedding and hands down Devin was the easiest vendor for us to work with during our entire wedding planning process. He was extremely responsive and friendly, even went above and beyond to learn songs we requested that he was unfamiliar with prior. I highly recommend Devin for any social event-. From planning to playing, he was the best! The best addition to our cocktail hour for sure! Thank you Devin for everything!

We hired The Honey Badgers to play our wedding in September and can say that it was hands-down our best investment. They were just all around chill and lovely. Super easy to communicate with, took great care in our arrangements, and couldn’t have been more kind and accommodating when some unexpected weather forced us to change to a plan B set-up right before they arrived. Most importantly, their sound was exactly what we were looking for. Our guests loved them so much and we got lots of requests for their information afterwards. My husband and I loved how genuine and sweet they were even just chatting during clean-up after the party was over. We felt they were super reasonably priced for all that they brought to the table. We both whole heartedly recommend The Honey Badgers for their talent and the care they put in the service they offer.
