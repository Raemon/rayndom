We got married at the Woodstock Inn this past October and initially hired Angie as a day-of coordinator. As life got busy and the planning process grew more complex, we upgraded to her full planning package—and it was absolutely the right decision. Angie was consistently supportive, thoughtful, and generous with her time. She was always available for a call, offered helpful opinions and guidance whenever we needed it, and kept us on track so we could enter the wedding weekend with confidence rather than stress. While we chose our own vendors and handled the contracts, Angie played a crucial role in coordinating everyone on the wedding weekend. Her communication and organization ensured that every piece fell perfectly into place. She also worked seamlessly with the venue’s coordinator, and their teamwork meant nothing was overlooked. Beyond logistics, Angie helped with design details, setting up our escort table and even providing her own card box and table numbers for us to use at no cost—such a thoughtful touch. Thanks to her support, we were able to be fully present, enjoy every moment, and trust that everything behind the scenes was running smoothly. We’re deeply grateful for all she did to make our day so seamless and memorable.

We had a small February wedding near Lake Placid, with both of our families traveling in internationally. Having Placid Planner involved made such a difference for me. Elexis kept everything organized, handled the logistics we never would have thought about, and made sure our families were taken care of throughout the weekend. Because of that, we were able to relax and actually enjoy our rare time together. We are so glad we worked with Placid Planner and would recommend her to anyone planning an intimate wedding in the area.

We said it 100 times to each other, but let me say it here: hiring Katy and her team was easily the best decision we made during our planning process. We set out thinking we could do it all ourselves and just needed a week of planner. Vanbee offered us a great solution. We met once a month to discuss progress and to-dos for the upcoming month. Katy kept us organized, on top of things, and was an invaluable sounding board. Having her insight throughout the process without having to break the bank was AMAZING! Could go on for an hour, but here are a few main reasons we loved working with Katy 1) She knows the area: she knows every vendor, venue, and staff member. This means she can come up with recommendations or chat directly with the venue/staff on our behalf. Can't stress how valuable that is if you are not local 2) Shes very organized and fast to respond: we worked using shared google docs. Katy helped us buildout a timeline and to-dos. She kept everything organized enabling us to move through tasks efficiently. 3) Calming presence: throughout the process and especially during the big weekend, Katy ensured everything ran smoothly. She was just so on top of things and able to reassure us (which most couples need at some point) Pricing is reasonable and they will flex up/down to your needs. If you are getting married in Saranac/Lake Placid, just make the smart call and hire Vanbee

Meg is an organizational superhero. She is a nerd for the details, which makes her the ideal wedding planner-- her attention to detail allows you to just focus on having a wonderful wedding day. She is professional, empathetic, patient, and an advocate for your needs and desires. I was blown away by her ability to manage so many competing priorities with ease. The ceremony and reception were seamless because of Meg!

Linda was wonderful to work with and was excellent at handling our ever changing requests. We were organising remotely and she was able to have patience with us to make it all happen.

We used Susan to do the floral for our Vermont wedding, and we could not have been happier with how everything turned out. From the first consultation, Susan listened to what I wanted, and worked with me collaboratively to achieve it within the budget I had set. She was very knowledgeable and a delight to work with. She listened carefully and asked a lot of questions to get a good sense of the overall style and colors we wanted. During the process, I changed my mind many times as to what I wanted, and was always adding something new. Susan did a great job at adjusting my vision to stick within my budget and still make it look beautiful. She stayed in touch with me during the planning process and was very responsive to my many emails and phone calls. She went above and beyond my expectations in every way, creating such a beautiful bouquet for me and my bridesmaids. All of the personal flowers and the ceremony and reception decorations were fresh and gorgeous, and many lasted for over a week after the wedding! I would highly recommend Susan for any and all floral needs!

Hiring Randi was the best decision of our wedding. Quite honestly, our wedding would not have been possible without Randi. My husband and I are from NY but have spent many years in Vermont and knew we wanted to get married at Mount Snow, our happy place. Randi truly made our dream wedding come true. She is extremely responsive, honest, hard working, passionate, dedicated, organized, professional, the list goes on! Not only did Randi help with every detail of the wedding but she helped keep both myself, husband, and my mother levelheaded during the entire process. She has the most calming energy and the answer to any question or request was always yes or we will find a way. She turns ideas into reality and brings your vision to life. I can not say enough good things about Randi. You, your family and your guests are truly missing out if you don't hire Randi as your wedding planner. She is the BEST & you will be beyond thankful for her!! Love M&M

Nancy is such a pro and her team is amazing, NJOY Event Planning executed our wedding weekend in Vermont to perfection and we could not have done it without their help. From the first time we talked to Nancy, we were impressed. She has extensive knowledge of the Vermont wedding scene and seemed to know every single vendor we asked her about personally which led to easy intros and made the logistics so so smooth because she had already worked with everyone we used. She consistently took things off of our plate while planning and her team made it so we could enjoy our wedding day fully and without any interruption or worry. We really appreciated how Nancy would always provide her professional opinion and recommendation while also letting us know that at the end of the day...it was our day and our call. She makes herself available at the drop of a hat and cares deeply about the couples she works with. Many say the planning process is stressful but not when you have Nancy and her team! I could not recommend NJOY Event Planning more highly

Samantha is an excellent day of coordinator. Our wedding day was heavily DIYed with lots of moving pieces and "friendors" and Samantha was integral in pulling the event off. She is easy to get along with, super experienced, accommodating, and professional. Before we hired her we had been unable to find a sound-technician to handle audio for the ceremony and reception and we were getting really worried. After joining our team she promptly found an excellent sound tech who turned out to be wonderful, and she handled all the booking and coordination completely so we didn't have to lift a finger. We're so so glad we found her and were able to bring her onto our team after having to postpone and re-plan our wedding and losing our original coordinator to scheduling troubles in the process. Samantha was all in, starting really early and staying really late. She did a great job! Would 100% recommend.
