My first chart reading with Kelsey completely exceeded my expectations. Going in with very little background in astrology, I wasn’t sure what it would be like; but from the start, her warmth, enthusiasm, and easygoing presence put me at ease. She has a wonderful way of breaking down astrological concepts so they’re easy to understand, while also bringing a creative, outside-the-box perspective and a truly collaborative energy. Her interpretations were incredibly thoughtful and insightful, and she always made space for my own reflections, staying fully engaged no matter where our conversation flowed. After that session, I started booking tarot readings with her and continue to do so regularly. I can’t imagine a better person to offer tarot or astrology services, whether for individuals, couples, or larger events. I wholeheartedly recommend Kelsey!

Favor is wonderful! I already had a few items for everyday wear from them so I knew exactly where to go when I was ready to purchase my wedding jewelry. I wore the cascade earrings and pebble necklace and purchased the crescent earrings for each of my bridesmaids. EVERYONE complimented me on my jewelry, it was absolutely perfect. I ordered my items online but many of the individually owned shops in Portland carry Favor as well. I cannot say enough about how beautiful and well made everything I have ever purchase from Favor is.

As soon as we started planning our wedding we knew we wanted mini cupcakes!!!!! Liz at The Candy Buffet was recommended to us by a friend and we instantly knew we were in the right hands!! She had so many flavors to chose from and baked us a beautiful box of samples to help us chose the flavors we wanted for our big day! She created the most beautiful dessert table I have ever seen!!! We had many tiers of cupcakes, each at different levels and dripping with stunning crystals that matched the chandeliers of our ballroom perfectly!!! Our guests couldn't wait to dive into these tiny treats, but not before the bride and groom!! The mini cupcakes were a perfect idea and it was so fun to see our guests chosing their favorite flavor (I think the carrot cake with cream cheese frosting mini cakes, which the was the groom's favorite, won the prize)... Our cupcakes were baked the day before our wedding and were so fluffy and fresh tasting!!! They were hands down one of the sweetest touches of our big day!!!! We would recommend The Candy Buffet to anyone who wants something different for their wedding day....

I received toasting flutes and a cake server set as a shower gift for my wedding... Couture Table contacted me to ensure that the custom set was the colors and style I wanted, and although they were perfect when I got them, I was assured that re-doing any part of my custom gift was an option to make sure they were perfect for me wedding. Very helpful and very friendly.

I used www.claytoncustom.com to buy personalized guitar picks for our wedding favors. They turned out GREAT! I loved that I could put a custom design (on both sides!) and have them match our wedding invitations and thank you cards. They were reasonably priced and had a lot of options to choose from. We sprinkled the guitar picks all over our candy buffet table and they were a big hit! Our guests loved them.
