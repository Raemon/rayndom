We got engaged at the Galway Christmas market in Nov of 2022 and we immediately knew we wanted to have our wedding in Ireland to share our love of Ireland with our closest friends and family. I stumbled upon Eloping in Ireland on Instagram while researching how you go about planning a wedding in Ireland and immediately knew we needed to book with them. They made everything so easy and stress free. They have the BEST recommendations and lists of vendors. We had a last minute request, less than 2 weeks from the wedding date, that we wanted a harpest to play during our ceremony. Roisin absolutely delivered! Kinnitty Castle was an absolute dream! The venue is stunning and everyone who works there is so nice and accommodating. I would highly recommend eloping in Ireland and book Roisin and Eloping in Ireland. You won’t regret it! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
