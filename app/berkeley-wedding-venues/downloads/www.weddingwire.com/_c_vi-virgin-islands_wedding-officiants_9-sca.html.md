We had the absolute best experience with Island Bliss planning our elopement and Aaron Englund officiating! We wanted something simple and private with no fuss and that’s exactly what we got. They always responded immediately to all our questions and concerns and provided us with advice and options without ever being pushy, and delivered exactly what we asked of them. Aaron picked us up on the day of the ceremony and drove us to beautiful Sapphire Beach. He was super personable and easy to talk to, we couldn’t have asked for anyone better to perform our ceremony. We truly can’t thank them enough for putting together our perfect elopement ceremony!

Louise Laird of Universal Life Church was the best! She provided a questionnaire via email to get some preliminary information about us, and then later, an 18-page list of suggestions for the various sections of our ceremony. Seemingly overwhelming at first, the variety of options not only proved to be much needed, but was an inspiration for us as we first worked to choose the overall theme of the ceremony, but the ideas began to flow, making it easier for us to customize some of the passages along the way. Still thinking it wouldn't be enough for her to really provide a customized and intimate ceremony, she showed her expertise in the short time we spent with her the day before our destination wedding. She drew out of us who it was we truly were together, what the day meant to us, and to the family and friends that joined us, and like an old friend, told our story in such a touching and loving way that we will never forget. She made sure to walk us through everything, was instrumental in making sure the final paperwork was handled quickly and seamlessly, and even worked with my then fiance to perform a little surprise in the end. Louise was amazing, and it couldn't have been better even if we'd done it at home, with someone we'd known! Thanks, Louise!

My husband and I could not have asked for a better person to marry us. Reissa was kind, professional, and a joy to work with. She provided us with a warm and memorable ceremony. We were very pleased with the way she listened to our requests and paid attention to detail. We would highly recommend her!

Pastor Nelson was the perfect officiant for our special day. He worked with me on the perfect ceremony script and was so kind, caring, and professional throughout the process. Our ceremony was beautiful and we are so thankful to have found Pastor Nelson to perform it!

We originally contacted Island Mike via email from his website. He was very responsive and helpful. He provided clear instructions for how to obtain our marriage license, helpful hints about travel to USVI, and recommendations for things to do while there. Every interaction was professional and informative. We wanted a sweet simple wedding at sunset with just the two of us and Island. Mike provided exactly that. Our ceremony took place around 5:30 at Limetree Beach on St. Thomas. He took some amazing pictures and enjoyed the moment with us. I highly recommend him.
