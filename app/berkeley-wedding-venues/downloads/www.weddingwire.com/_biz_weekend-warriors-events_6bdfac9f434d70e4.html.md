Life savers! The best team.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
Weekend Warriors was hands down the most professional and helpful team we could have asked for. We recently hosted a large fundraising event at The Barn at Brambleton, and Charles and his staff were truly extraordinary. We genuinely could not have pulled this event off without them.  
  
They were there every step of the way, setup, breakdown, helping with food, and constantly tidying throughout the event, doing absolutely anything we needed without ever being asked. Their attention to detail, positive attitude, and willingness to jump in wherever needed made the entire night run seamlessly.  
  
Truly a 5-star experience. I will never host an event without this team again. If you are considering anyone else, stop and just trust Charles and the Weekend Warriors team.

Exceeded Expectations!

Cannot thank the entire team at Weekend Warriors Events enough for their hard work and dedication; from the very beginning of the planning process, straight up to the wedding day they were responsive, organized, and easy to work with. The team’s attention to detail was evident in every aspect. We would wholeheartedly recommend Weekend Warriors Events and their phenomenal team to anyone looking for event staff!

A must service for your event 

We hired the weekend warriors for our backyard wedding on 10/11. We have nothing but great things to say about their team. For one, their communication is excellent. They answered all of our questions, provided timely responses, and were flexible with all of our last minute changes. They are true professionals. They showed up on time, dressed for the occasion, and worked seamlessly with all other vendors. If anything went wrong, we did not hear about it. They took care of specific things we had talked through, and then went even beyond that to assist anyone else with whatever needed to be done at the time. We could not recommend them more. This is one of those services you don’t think about immediately when event planning but in my opinion it’s one of the most crucial. Thanks to the WW for all of your excellent work. Will hire again.

Welcome Party Warriors

The Weekend Warriors are amazing! We hosted a welcome party for 140 people at our Airbnb at the end of September, 2025, and hired Weekend Warriors. We didn't know what we needed, but they did! Charles and his team (Andrea and Brenda) keep everything running smoothly and allowed us to enjoy the party. Even before the event, Charles suggested other vendors with whom he had worked to provide necessary services and all of his recommendations were great. Weekend Warriors were professional, friendly, and extremely competent. We would hire them again and highly recommend them.

Highly Recommend!

I highly recommend Charles and his team! They recently helped me on two weddings I had and the amount of support they provided was amazing! It definitely made the night go smoother, and took a lot off my shoulders! Charles is very personable, reliable, helpful, and enthusiastic! Communication was great from the beginning, all the way until the event was over. If you need assistance with your event, I highly recommend reaching out to Charles!

Top Tier 10/10

One thing I would never do is tell a lie about a vendor. If I could give Weekend Warriors a 1000/10, I would. They deserve more than 5 stars. I had a smaller DIY wedding, around 80 people and they were able to put me at ease more than any other vendor. If you don't have staff at your venue or you just want extra hands through the duration of the event, THESE ARE YOUR PEOPLE. Throughout the months of planning, they checked in to make sure everything was good. I sent a checklist of things that needed to be done throughout the night, and I never had to worry if it was going to be done, because they were on top of things. They will forever be a special part of my day. So personable and easy to talk to. Every one of my guests were amazed at their professionalism.  
They were with us for about 6-7 hours.

Excellent service!

We hired Weekend Warriors Events and used their Extra Hands Support service for our rainy day wedding elopement, and honestly, they were amazing.  
  
The weather threw us a curveball, but their team stepped in and made everything feel totally under control. They handled all the last-minute changes—moving equipment, helping guests, rearranging things because of the rain—without missing a beat. It was such a relief to have them there.  
  
They were super flexible, easy to work with, and just really helpful all around. Having them there gave us the peace of mind to actually enjoy the day, which meant everything.  
  
If you’re planning any kind of event and need extra support, we highly recommend Weekend Warriors. Total lifesavers!

Reliable & professional

We had a great experience working with Weekend Warrior Events! Their team was professional, reliable, and jumped right in to support our event seamlessly. From setup to breakdown, they handled everything with care and efficiency. It was clear they were experienced and committed to making sure things ran smoothly. I would absolutely recommend them to anyone looking for dependable extra hands on event day!

Weekend Warriors were just that!

This business is such a great concept and Charles is fantastic at his job. He helped out with a Christmas Party we hosted this weekend. What exactly did he help with? Anything and everything. Having him there allowed me to actually enjoy my own party rather than focus on hosting.   
  
He checked in with me multiple times before the party, asking if he could do anything to help prior to the event. He kept a running list of everything we needed picked up (bags of ice, cocktail garnishes, etc.) and even did a final check-in day-of.   
  
He then showed up to party prep and jumped right in, filling every gap you can think of. He carried our extra tables upstairs, helped us finish decorating, got our extra food set up, and more.   
  
Then during the party, he kept food replenished and trash cleared out. At one point I realized I had forgotten to take a video of the pre-party setup (an idea I had so that I don’t have to remember how I arranged everything each year). As soon as I asked him, he took a perfect video of the whole house that will make party prep so much easier next year!  
  
From the other reviews, it sounds like Charles is also a fantastic hire for wedding help. I can vouch that he does so much more than that. I highly recommend Weekend Warriors for any event or task you need help with!

Best support staff!

I could not have asked for a better experience with Weekend Warriors Event. Charles was very helpful with support leading up to the wedding event, as he knew that I was planning the wedding. On the wedding day, he and his team went above and beyond to make the wedding happen smoothly. Not only did they do the tasks I had asked of them, but they also identified other things to help with and did that. Charles helped my grandmother down the stairs before the wedding aisle, and when another group of people arrived to the venue for photos he informed them that this was closed for a private event. He and his team were very thoughtful, kind, responsible and professional. I highly recommend Weekend Warriors for your event!
