Lovely day in May

We were married in May and had a lovely time at this beautiful venue. There were no boats docked around Navy Point, which allowed our guests a beautiful view. The museum aspect and the old boats were very cool for our guests to explore during before the wedding started.

CBMM is the most beautiful venue on the eastern shore - I know I am biased because that is where I got married, but it is seriously stunning. While the pictures you see are gorgeous, just wait until you see it in person. It is truly one of a kind. We held our wedding on August 25th and had our ceremony in front of the bandstand, and had our cocktail hour in the boat house. Many guests commented on how amazing the boat house was - they loved getting to see all of the antique boats, and there is a dock on the other side that made for some amazing photos! We held our reception under a tent on navy point and it was truly spectacular. Many guests complimented that it was one of the most beautiful weddings they had ever attended. Working with Liz Cowee was amazing! She is so flexible and will answer all of your questions (My now husband and I had a ton leading up to the wedding)! Liz even unlocked the light house and we were able to go to the very top to get some amazing photos and have a birds eye view of our wedding! I highly recommend this venue! You will not regret it! Thanks CBMM we will be back to see you very soon!!

The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum was an absolute DREAM venue and the most stunning backdrop for our wedding weekend in St. Michaels. My husband and I got engaged in St. Michaels and knew from that moment on that we wanted to get married there. We came across the Maritime Museum and were instantly blown away by the gorgeous views on the Navy Point and unique property. We decided to have both our rehearsal dinner on the property (in the Small Boat Shed) and our ceremony and reception (on Navy Point). Liz and her team went above and beyond in so many ways -- including by making the wedding planning process leading up the wedding seamless and fun and, on the day of, making sure every detail was in place and perfect. The CBMM team even arranged to have a golf cart transport my husband’s grandmother right to the ceremony so she wouldn’t have to strain walking the grounds. We are so thankful to the CBMM team for everything they did to make our wedding an absolute fairytale for us, and look forward to coming back for years to come to relive the happy memories.

Ida Heelan made our selection of the museum campus a perfect choice for our wedding! She graciously helped with all aspects of planning and getting the insurance for the event. She went above and beyond on many occasions but most memorably when my necklace broke. She fixed it herself by using thread to replace a broken chain link and saved the day! Many thanks to the whole museum team!

The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum was the perfect setting for our big day. The weather was perfect and our guests absolutely loved the location. It was so much character and charm. We could not have been happier with the way it turned out. Ida, Melissa, and the entire CBMM staff were wonderful to work with as well. Strongly recommend!

The team at CBMM is outstanding, especially the Event Coordinator Ida Heelan. The setting and services were extremely professional but more importantly, the great amount of concern demonstrated to ensure our special day was perfect. Ida provided excellent guidance and was present both before and during the event to ensure all expectations were met. When the weather worked against us, Ida had prepared us well in advance for all of the options and it was a simple and easy adjustment to ensure that all our guests stayed warm and dry. I can't say enough. If I could do it all again, I would.

We held our son's rehearsal dinner at the Steamboat Building, Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum. We were guided by Ida Heelan, which was extremely helpful considering .....we live in Connecticut and everything had to be done by email or phone. The site was absolutely beautiful...the cocktail hour was held on the deck, then a buffet dinner inside. Ida also helped with recommendations for a caterer and flowers. We used Gourmet By the Bay and Seaberry Farms and were delighted with the cooperative spirit of all the vendors! Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum was a great place to start the wedding weekend!

Fantastic waterfront property with a huge amount of unique opportunities for wedding photography. We have found the staff friendly, professional, and attentive! Food quality is excellent, and you could not have a prettier setting. Saint Michaels is a treasure unto itself but the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum is a jewel that should not be overlooked for that special event, or just a visit.

The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. Michaels is a true gem - beautiful, historic, and right on the water... an absolutely unforgettable spot for a wedding. We couldn't recommend it more highly! - Rev. Laura C. Cannon, Owner
