Hannah at Sage Events was absolutely amazing. From the beginning, she was organized, responsive, and so easy to work with. She truly went above and beyond to make sure every detail was taken care of, and our wedding day ran so smoothly because of her. We especially can’t thank her enough for saving the day when we needed to live stream the ceremony last minute for my grandma—she handled it quickly and calmly, and it meant the world to our family. We loved working with Hannah and are so grateful for everything she did. We highly recommend Sage Events to anyone planning their wedding!

We truly could not have had a more perfect wedding day, and that is all thanks to Sierra and her team at Little Bird Events! She has an immense knowledge of vendors in the area and helped us picked exactly the ones we needed to fit our wants and budget. Her and her team were wonderful to work with throughout the whole process. They made everything so much easier for us, and we couldn’t have had our dream day without their guidance, organization, and professionalism. All our guests were so impressed with our wedding, and we are still getting compliments about just how much fun they had! We truly had the best day, and everything felt so seamless on our end! We could not recommend Sierra and Little Bird Events enough!

We weren’t sure if we were going to hire a coordinator, but ended up deciding to do it. That was easily the best thing we could have done. Neither my bride or I had a single thing to worry about on the day of, and everything was perfectly aligned with what we wanted (even things we hadn’t specified). Katt is very easy going and made the process easy. We came to her with so many questions about planning that she was happy to help with and always responded quickly. We’re both so grateful that we had her and would recommend her to any and everyone!

Where to even start with how AMAZING Bliss was??! From day one and our first meeting with Theresa (the owner of Bliss), we were sold. Shortly after, we met our coordinator, Monica. She was an absolute gem from the get go. She was always there for us with answers to our questions, opinions, ideas, resolutions, etc. Monica is IMPECCABLE at her job. She made me feel reassured and relaxed from the months leading up to wedding day til the day of. My wedding day was easy breezy due to her. Monica is so sweet and kind and I feel like I will forever be in debt to her for pulling off my wedding with such ease. I also would be remiss if I didn't mention Lindsey, who literally designed every aspect of my wedding. Lindsey has such a knack for gorgeous detail and a great eye. I trusted her vision and was not disappointed. Lindsey was amazing to work with as well, and very easy going and approachable. Also HUGE shout out to Tonia (Monica's assistant the day of). She was so sweet and fun and a great addition to the day. Another HUGE shout out to Libby for all of her behind the scenes detail work (hanging our lighted ceiling for 2 hours!). And another HUGE, HUGE shoutout to Jaymee for making the most beautiful floral arch, my bouquet, centerpieces, bouts, corsages, bridal party bouqs, etc. She really shined! Bliss is incredible. You will not be disappointed if you choose to work with them! A very professional, down to earth, and easy to work with group of women there. I am so happy with the way my wedding day went, how it looked, and will never forget it. Thank you, Bliss!!

Thank you for planning our beautiful wedding. It was everything we hoped for and more. Our night was magical and we owe so much of that to you and your incredible team. Brandi, you were absolutely delightful to work with. Your professionalism, patience, creativity, and can do attitude transformed our ideations into realities. Your touch on everything from the tiles to the linens, to the staging of the lounge & cocktail party was spot on. We felt so confident in your abilities and are so happy to have you as our wedding planner. Thank you with all my heart.

Glenna is incredible. We never could have pulled off this wedding without her! She walked with us every step of the way- she was the first vendor we booked. Her knowledge of Idaho's wedding resources is inexhaustible- there is no doubt in my mind that she knows more vendors than anyone else in the state. She has been in business for over 30 years in the Treasure Valley and it SHOWS! Even when things went wrong at the wedding, Glenna smoothed them out in no time, making the day a success. I would use her again & again!
