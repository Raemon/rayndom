Your wedding is one of the most important days of your life. Most people will remember three things: The dress, the food, and the party. We can’t sew, and we haven’t found a cure for dry chicken, but we definitely know how to throw a BASH!  
  
Bash Entertainment is a 2nd generation, family & locally owned/operated company committed to ensuring that planning your special day is easy and stress-free. Our staff will personally walk you through the planning process to ensure that we make what you have dreamed about into reality. Making every bash unique and personal is our top priority.  
  
We’re so glad you’re here and can’t wait to meet you and start working on your special day. Remember, a BASH is always better!

Amazing Entertainment!

Very professional and organized. They were very energetic and kept the crowd entertained. We did not have a wedding organizer, but Bash Entertainment was very attentive and kept the reception flowing perfectly. We would definitely recommend and will use for our other children’s weddings.

Best dance floor!

Chad and Dylan were the best DJs!! They were very communicative, professional, and rolled with anything we threw at them. Dance floor was everything we wanted, and several of our friends have told us since that it was the best wedding dance floor they’d been to! Would definitely recommend!

10/10 Would recommend 

Chad and his crew are wonderful to work with! I impressed upon him not only was I looking for a fun dance party, but someone to MC and really help drive the timeline of our event, which he absolutely did. I told him the vibe I was going for with the party portion of our reception, and he nailed it! We’ve gotten so many compliments on how fun our wedding was and everyone stayed out on the dance floor the whole night! Which is exactly what I was hoping for! Chad is not lying about their amazing set up. The dance floor lights absolutely make the party and was everything I was hoping for. He’s so professional to work with and really listened to us during our planning sessions. Would recommend bash to anyone!!
