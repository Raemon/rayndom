Dream venue - beautiful, easy to work with, flexible!

We could not rave about our venue more! We got married in September at Carrington Manor and have since received compliment after compliment about the venue. Our coordinator said it had the best flow of a venue in the Bay Area that they’ve ever worked with. There were different areas for the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception which made things flow well and guests knew where to be. We hardly needed florals considering the greenery on the estate was stunning and came out beautifully in our pictures! The inside barn area for dancing worked so well with our band as well. There was beautiful lighting already supplied by the venue and they were amazing to work with!
