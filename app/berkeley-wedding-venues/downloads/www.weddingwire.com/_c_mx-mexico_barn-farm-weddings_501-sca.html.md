From the moment I began looking into doing a destination wedding I knew that I wanted to have a very beautiful and unique location! My wedding planner Dana and her team were amazing! Down to the last detail, they made it very special! They were realistic, and they were very detailed oriented throughout the entire process! My job was made so easy as they presented me with a few local options for each necessary category like flowers and DJ ! They worked hard with me to ensure I kept on budget! And were able to help me reduce costs where they could! The execution was impeccable and all of my friends and family said it was the best that they have ever been to! They even helped me arrange a welcome party for my guest the day before the wedding and that was one of the highlights of our trip! Alquimia was a beautiful location and the staff was very very attentive and insured that all my guests had the best possible experience and I am very grateful for that!
