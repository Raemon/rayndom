One of the top objectives my wife and I wanted to check off for our wedding was to celebrate the Charm City. As we toured the several beautiful venues in the city, we remembered going to the BMI in one of our earlier dates. Touring the museum once more through the lens of our wedding and objective, we knew we found the place! The Baltimore Museum of Industry showcases everything we love about Baltimore - it's rich history, the homages to the several businesses in the area, the beautiful Baltimore skyline. We absolutely loved it! As the day approached, we worked closely with Jesse, the Director of events, and he helped execute the vision! He helped us coordinate the space with our vendors walking us through where certain stations made sense. The synergy between the BMI and our caterer was perfect. On the night of, we were helped with two Jesses, and both put us at ease! Thank you both! As we reflect on our wedding, several guests commented how much they loved the space and look forward to coming back to explore more in depth. The BMI offered several amazing views and photography settings that we loved. The space will forever have a place in our heart. Thank you, BMI team!

We loved this venue immediately, of course, it's absolutely gorgeous and great for a small wedding. The owners are very kind and accommodating, they even let us shoot our engagement photos in a private class. We had good experiences with staff as well, our teacher was great, and the staff member working at our wedding dressed up in costume along with everyone else. Highly recommend!

We were married in May and had a lovely time at this beautiful venue. There were no boats docked around Navy Point, which allowed our guests a beautiful view. The museum aspect and the old boats were very cool for our guests to explore during before the wedding started.

AVAM was perfect for us. We had ~240 guests at our wedding and had a Jewish wedding that was a bit more on the traditional side. AVAM was able to accommodate everything. It's a beautiful space for great value. If you're looking for a venue that's a bit less traditional but still beautiful and accommodating to weddings, we'd highly recommend AVAM.

We had our wedding at the Maryland Zoo in October 2025, with our ceremony and reception in the Mansion House Porch and cocktail hour at Penguin Coast. The zoo is such an amazing venue - it’s fun and unique, but also really beautiful! Tons of our guests said ours was the most fun wedding they’d been to. Everyone loved meeting Olive and Pearl, the penguin animal ambassadors, and watching the penguins and other birds while drinking cocktails. Kenzie and her team were a dream to work with - they were super responsive and flexible, worked seamlessly with all of our vendors to keep everything running smoothly across the multiple locations we used, and so helpful and friendly to everyone on the day! There were so many pretty spots around the zoo to take photos. We absolutely recommend the zoo as your venue!

We were gifted with Joe, Nicole, and Chef Tyler for our wedding. As most weddings go, we were stressed. As soon as we sat down for our tasting Joe, Nicole, and Chef Tyler alleviated all of our stress. The dishes and the layout for our wedding had us filled with joy and excitement. Every single dish chef Tyler presented us were absolutely delicious. Just the Maryland crab cakes, Peruvian steak, and paella could have sufficed, but chef Tyler went the extra mile and was able to incorporate dishes from our culture. Dishes that our older family members could not only appreciate, but enjoy because of how delicious they really were. He was able to create pancit, lumpia Shanghai, and lechon kawali (that's pork belly) that was so good I ended up eating all of it. We were so confident and impressed with Chef Tyler's creations that we gave him full creative freedom on the dessert menu. Food is a big part of our lives and one of the significant factors that started our relationship in its early beginnings. Tasting how good the food was, we knew our guests were going to be blown away. Not only was the food amazing, but the setup and layout of our wedding was beautiful. Nicole was able to envision something truly incredible. The use of space, colors, and aesthetic that Nicole was able to conjure up was exactly the look we were hoping for. My favorite part was the bar next to the dolphin tank. It was an aquarium bar which only exists here. A place you can watch sealife while enjoying a drink rather than awkwardly at your phone like at so many weddings I've been to before. My now wife and I were able to see the beautiful layout, but Nicole made sure we had drinks in our hands the whole night which was incredible. She also got a plate of lechon for my now father in law who didn't have to wait in line for the mouth watering pork. She really took care of us that night. It was absolute beautiful and I can't thank Joe, Nicole, and Chef Tyler enough for all their work and help.

I highly recommend hosting your wedding or party at The Elm! It is such a unique venue and made our day feel exactly like 'us.' If you want a space that is going to add a lot of charm and love to your day, choose The Elm!

Evergreen Museum and Library is a hidden gem for Baltimore weddings. The venue coordinators and managers are very professional, very polite and very communicative. We could not have asked for a better place to get married. The pricing is reasonable, and the contract is clear and well-specified. The venue team also provides a list of vendors that they have worked with in the past, which is a long and helpful list. Thanks for everything Evergreen!

This was the hardest decision for my husband and I to make. We went back and forth between 2 venues and he asked me once night "where do you see us getting married"? So, I said tearfully "Maryland Historical Society". Best decision ever! Scott Rubin and his team were so so incredible to deal with. I, of course was slightly crazy and frantic at times, and he reassured me it would all be worked out and be done to our guidelines. He was there from beginning of the day through the end! Our guests loved the space and thought it was incredibly unique. (Cocktail hour was in the "mastodon room"! Parking was onsite and all of our other vendors had an easy loading process, which made our day less stressful. Plus, the neighborhood has a ton of dining, hotels and things to do. So our guests who traveled were able to take some time to explore Baltimore. Pricing was great to fit our budget! Our photographers had a blast shooting around the museum as well. Couldn't be happier with how our wedding turned out!
