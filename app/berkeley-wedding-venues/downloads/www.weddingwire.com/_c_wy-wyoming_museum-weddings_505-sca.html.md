The venue was perfect for the vibe we wanted for our wedding. We love that it was a piece of history, but also had an elegant feel without having to add many decorations. The lawn was great for the ceremony and the AHSC was great for the reception. The size was perfect, we had about 130 people, and it did not feel over cramped. We loved the beautiful 100+ year old bar. We loved being able to serve our guests their first drinks from behind it. Michelle was so kind and easy to work with. She answered all our questions and would make extra time for us to make sure our questions were answered so our vision could come to life. Highly recommend this venue for weddings and any other events.

What a fantastic experience! We had our wedding reception at Ringholz studio for 30 people after getting married at Colter Bay in Teton National Park. Ashley coordinated the event and was wonderful! She was professional, communicative, and so helpful with decor ideas. She flawlessly brought our wedding reception vision to life and made the process so fun and easy! We would highly recommend using this space for private events! For guests to get to enjoy beautiful art was a unique and makes for great conversation. The location is perfect for continuing the party to places such as the Million Dollar Cowboy bar, just a short walk away! Our chef was very happy with the spacious prep area and double oven. We would highly recommend this space for a reception dinner, rehearsal dinner, or any private event.
