Beautiful setting, seamless experience 

French Country Manor was the perfect setting for our wedding day. The outdoor space is absolutely beautiful — elegant, scenic, and exactly what we envisioned for our celebration. Even when we were hit with torrential rain, everything still felt seamless and magical. The tented setup ended up being perfect and honestly added to the charm of the day.  
  
Getting ready on-site was such a great experience and made the entire day feel relaxed and special. The space was comfortable, picturesque, and ideal for photos and those quiet moments before the celebration began. Although our reception was held at a different location, French Country Manor set the tone for the day in the best way possible and was the perfect location for our ceremony.

We're all about trust. Our community relies on honest reviews to help you make those big decisions with ease.
