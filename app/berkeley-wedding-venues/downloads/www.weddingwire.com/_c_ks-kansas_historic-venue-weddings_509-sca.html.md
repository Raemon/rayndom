Our daughter chose The Lincoln Event Space for her wedding, which was 2 weeks ago. We can not say enough positives about The Lincoln Event Space! From start to finish the communication was prompt, everything explained in detail, & numerous questions answered completely. The venue itself is stunning & all of our guests raved about the Speakeasy & the main reception area. The bridal suite is incredible & we enjoyed our 5 hours of pre-wedding festivities (hair, makeup, pictures), as did the guys in the Grooms Room! Kirstan & her staff were professional & courteous & didn't miss a beat in keeping the day & evening flowing perfectly. When we realized I had forgotten to pick up the table linens, Kirstan immediately stepped in & within 20 minutes it was taken care of. I don't think we could have asked for a better experience, a better day, or a better venue! If we could give 10 stars we would! Thank you Kirstan & The Lincoln Event Space for the pampering & the memorable day!

Loved working with Kary Taylor and the team at Wichita Boathouse and Xclusive Events. Professional and responded quickly to all questions and requests. Bonus--when you book the Boathouse, you automatically book Xclusive for all of the bartending needs. Multiple packages and options to choose from--its like they really care about your event and are invested in making everything run smoothly. The venue is beautiful, so we were able to keep our decoration simple/elegant. Guests can explore the grounds and the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame museum on the first level, during the downtime between ceremony and reception.

Working Donica and Tom was great. They are easy to work with and even featured a specialty drink for our reception. We loved the vibe of the Wareham and our guests did too. Who doesn't want their name on the Wareham marquee?

Overall, it was a wonderful experience! Such a beautiful venue and the price is just right! The owner is lovely to work with. When we had to postpone 2 days before our wedding and reschedule due to Covid, she was very understanding and flexible. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a venue!

The Beacon staff were really well organized and attentive to our needs. They were also very flexible and made sure to create the day that we envisioned. Communication was always prompt and we could tell that our business was valued. They had a solid booking process and we felt hands on from start to finish. With 3 floors and many different rooms it is easy to create the event that you want. The building is beautiful and really added to the aesthetic of the wedding; we had so many guests tell us how beautiful and unique our wedding was because of this venue. Staff were friendly and went above and beyond when we had questions during the day of the wedding. This is the venue for you if your wedding is going to be in Topeka!
