Elizabeth did a wonderful job officiating our wedding. During this holiday season, she was able to accommodate us on short notice at her home, and everything went so smoothly. She was extremely professional, sweet, and warm throughout the ceremony, and she truly gave us a beautiful and memorable experience as a couple.

We truly don’t have enough good things to say about Ginger and the way she conducted our ceremony. Before the wedding, a few people asked who was marrying us, and when we said it was someone we met online and had never met in person, they thought we were crazy. But if you didn’t know better, you would have thought Ginger had witnessed our relationship from the very beginning. She captured our story so beautifully in her script—there truly wasn’t a dry eye in the room. What made it even more special was the way she delivered it: warm, engaging, and in a true storyteller style that drew everyone in. She has such a friendly, comforting presence, and it genuinely felt like being married by a friend. We’re so grateful we connected with Ginger and would absolutely recommend her to anyone looking for a heartfelt, meaningful, and memorable ceremony.

Our experience working with Rev. Kelly was truly special! When we first were looking for an officiant we felt very overwhelmed by the idea of finding someone who could help us to merge our ceremony combining our unique background, cultures, and religions. When we found Rev. Kelly and had our first meeting with truly felt we had know her forever and remember saying how comfortable we felt with her. Not only is Rev. Kelly kind and empathetic but she is amazing at what she does. She provided us many resources and suggestions on helping us create our personal ceremony! Her organization and eye for detail gave us full confidence in her as well! Our loved ones appreciated the beauty of the ceremony she provided for us and how she presented it on our wedding day! If you care about feeling connected and heard, we absolutely recommend working with Rev. Kelly! (Thank you Rev. Kelly for all your attention and support during our wedding process, we truly can't thank you enough)!

Father Jim is a kind, funny, and caring individual. I don’t think my husband and I could have asked for a better officiant at our wedding. He provides exceptional service and is willing to personalize your ceremony. We had countless guests comment on how beautiful the ceremony was, and we have Father Jim to thank for that! We would highly recommend him to anyone!

Luanne was easy to work with. She made sure everything was exactly how we wanted it for our special day. She was very personable and very knowledgeable about the marriage license process and helping us with it. She made sure everyone was aware of what was going on, including our vendors, for the day. She did a wonderful job!

We picked Christmas Eve as our wedding date, and naturally had trouble finding anyone available to wed us. Within a couple hours of reaching out to Rev Judith we received a return phone call that she was available, and what the next steps were. Another hurdle we faced was the size of our guest list. Contrary to others we had a extremely small guest list, and no wedding party (i.e. Groomsmen or Bridesmaid). Rev. Judith has multiple wedding packages to offer. The Micro Wedding Package was PERFECT for our needs. The documents Rev. Judith sent us were very detailed and instantly assured us we were working with a professional that wouldn't let us down. As the date got closer Rev. Judith checked in with us periodically, and made sure we were prepared, which reassured us that we had nothing to worry about. Many thanks to Rev. Judith for taking care of all these details so that we could enjoy our stress free ceremony!

We worked with Stephen Workman for our wedding and he was amazing! He made the process stress-free from leading up to the wedding to the day of and even after the day. He handled all of the logistics with the marriage license and put together such a beautiful ceremony for us.

Reenie made the process of creating our ceremony an easy task. It was nice to meet with her and discuss what we did and did not want in a ceremony. She wrote everything up for us, including personalized details and readings that were meaningful to us, and sent it ahead of time for us to review and make small edits as needed. Her services were affordable and she made us feel comfortable throughout the process. We would recommend her to anyone!

My husband and I truly couldn’t recommend Rev Kent enough!! He made this foreign process (to us) so easy and put all our worries at ease. From the first phone call to the big day itself it honestly felt that Rev Kent was someone we had known our whole lives and we immediately knew he was the one to marry us. He had so much knowledge and truly helped us curate a beautiful ceremony. If you are considering Rev Kent let this be your sign to go with him, I promise you won’t regret it!!
