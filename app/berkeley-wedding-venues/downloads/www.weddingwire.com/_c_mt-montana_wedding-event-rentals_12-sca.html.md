We hired Quartermoon for our wedding and we were blown away with the service. The restrooms were amazing! They were clean and well stocked with anything we would need. They were also so nice and cool during the few days that it was 96-98 degrees. Our guests could not stop talking about how great they were and they LOVED the music playing inside. We had them during the busy season in July, so they ended up having to slightly change the drop off day to an earlier date, but it worked out very well with all the people coming and going the days leading up to the event. The communication was timely and setup/takeaway was an absolute breeze. If anyone is looking for a portable restroom for a wedding or any other event, Quartermoon is absolutely the way to go!

Cole was helpful before we even knew where we were getting married, so when we got some details ironed out I knew I wanted to hire Horsin' for our welcome party. Cole and Daniel helped legitimately every step of the way, from helping us figure out our setup to sourcing drinks. Cole even made drink menus for the night and moved the HEAVY coolers to the covered patio when we got hit with a surprise storm. They did great work, but more importantly they are great people and were such a fun addition to the night that I can't imagine the night without Horsin' Around!

Cheryl was the most amazing decorator!! Was always incredibly friendly and professional at all times during this stressful and busy time. Was always honest with us about what she felt would be the best route for us to take, but always great about reminding us it is our day and we “get what we want.” Went it came to the day of our wedding she was amazing and watching her vision come to fruition was beautiful and we knew we made the right decision hiring her.

I highly recommend FV Party Rentals! Billy was beyond helpful and accommodating. He met us at the wedding location 5 months prior in order to take measurements and discuss our proposed layout, which changed several times! On our wedding day, it rained all morning, and then we got a huge hail storm that dropped 6 inches of hail just an hour before our ceremony. Billy was so flexible with making arrangements for the dancefloor to be set up, despite the weather. It ended up clearing for our evening reception, which was just beautiful. Billy accommodated last minute requests and made me feel like I was his only customer, always calm and caring for my needs. He is the ultimate professional. I would definitely use FV Party Rentals in the future!
