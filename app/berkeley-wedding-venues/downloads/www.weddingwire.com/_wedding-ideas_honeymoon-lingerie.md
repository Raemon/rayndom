Picture this: You've finally said "I do" and all the stress of wedding planning has slipped away. It's time to pack for your first romantic getaway as a married couple, and that calls for some extra-special honeymoon lingerie. What are you putting in your suitcase? Aside from all the essentials, don't forget to pack a few sexy little things to take [your time between the sheets](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/honeymoon-sex) to the next level. Whether you prefer lingerie with feminine and flirty details, like embroidered lace bralettes and babydoll dresses, or sheer bodysuits that bare it all, we've rounded up seductive looks for a range of body types, budgets, and styles. Bonus: Some of these looks can even double as sleepwear or shapewear. So before you zip up your suitcase, be sure to add a few of these looks to your cart—we promise you won't regret it (and neither will your new spouse).

## Embroidered Lace Torsolette

This bridal lingerie set goes back to basics. The embroidered lace corset can double as your [wedding day undergarments](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-shop-for-wedding-undergarments) and wedding night lingerie. Boning and back panels provide bust support for a strapless wedding dress while also shaping your figure.

If you're off to a beach destination for your honeymoon, consider bringing this sexy bra (and the [matching panties](https://www.revolve.com/thistle-and-spire-corsica-bikini-in-ink/dp/TIRR-WI145/)) along. The open cup and wire placement give off the illusion of a seashell design.

## 

## Charmeuse Chemise

## 

## Sheer Black Robe

You don't have to buy white lingerie for your honeymoon—opting for black is also a great option. This black kimono-style robe features a fun and flirty dot pattern with lace trim. 

**Torrid** kimono sleeve midi robe, $70, [Torrid](https://www.torrid.com/product/kimono-sleeve-midi-robe---dot-lace-black/16407243.html)

## 

## Long-Sleeve Bodysuit

Sexy lingerie doesn't have to be strapless or sleeveless, as proven by this long sleeve bodysuit. The strategically placed lace and sheer back show the perfect amount of skin. 

**Bardot** Vezza lace bodysuit, $99, [REVOVLE](https://www.revolve.com/bardot-vezza-lace-bodysuit-in-black/dp/BARD-WS254/)

## 

## Strappy Black Bodysuit

Show some skin while feeling fully supported by underwire cups. The mesh panels, lace detailing, and thong cut make this one of the sexiest honeymoon lingerie looks on our list. 

**Wolf & Whistle** fuller bust lace and mesh strappy bodysuit, $53, [ASOS](https://www.asos.com/us/wolf-whistle/wolf-whistle-fuller-bust-lace-and-mesh-strappy-bodysuit-in-black/prd/23303977)

## 

## Lilac Mini Slip

There's something inherently seductive about silk charmeuse fabric. The smooth feeling, fun lilac color, and lace trim on this style are enough to set the mood for your honeymoon. 

**Only Hearts** silk charmeuse mini slip, $219, [Shopbop](https://www.shopbop.com/silk-charmeuse-mini-slip-only/vp/v=1/1534822603.htm)

## 

## Lace Bra, Garter, and Panty Set 

This three-piece set including a lace bra, lace thong, and garter belt can be worn together or as standalone pieces. The dusty blue color is a pretty alternative to white or black, and the removable garter is a sexy way to spice things up from your usual bra-and-panties routine. 

**Wolf & Whistle** lace strappy lingerie set, $45, [ASOS](https://www.asos.com/us/wolf-whistle/wolf-whistle-lace-strappy-lingerie-set-in-cornflower-blue/grp/57455)

## 

## Velvet Babydoll Mini

If you're not sold on the idea of honeymoon lingerie, a babydoll dress is the easiest way to lean into your sensual side while feeling comfortable. Plus, velvet and sheer mesh are one hot duo (not as hot as you and your S.O., of course).

**Torrid** underwire babydoll velour & lace black, $70, [Torrid](https://www.torrid.com/product/underwire-babydoll---velour-lace-black/15652869.html)

## 

## Sheer Lace Camisole

There's something about a sheer lace camisole that's super seductive, especially when it's black. The contoured fit and thin straps leave nothing to be desired (except for you, of course). Complete the set with the matching [lace boyshorts](https://www.shopbop.com/signature-lace-boyshort-hanky-panky/vp/v=1/1547941086.htm). 

**Hanky Panky** signature lace V front cami, $52, [Shopbop](https://www.shopbop.com/signature-lace-front-cami-hanky/vp/v=1/1551610076.htm)
