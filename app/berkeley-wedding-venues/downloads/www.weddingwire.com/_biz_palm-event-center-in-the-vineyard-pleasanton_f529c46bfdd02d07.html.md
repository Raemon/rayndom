The Palm Event Center in the Vineyard is a contemporary private winery estate nestled in Livermore Valley Wine Country. Surrounded by vineyards and featuring a dramatic palm tree-lined entrance, the venue is meant to make an impression while still providing a dreamy wine country feel for couples and guests.

**THE VENUE**

The grounds feature spectacular views for outdoor ceremonies and ample photo ops. A lawn opening up to the vineyards is the perfect outdoor location for a wine country ceremony. In addition, the venue also allows couples to marry indoors within a gorgeous Estate Room, lined with barrels and glowing tea light candles.

The reception Ballroom can seat up to 350 guests but still feels cozy enough for smaller guest counts. An impressive candle wall is a stunning backdrop for any head table while the contemporary interior design gives couples a light and airy feeling for their wedding aesthetic. Tons of windows let in ample light. Wine barrels and glittering tea light candles are tastefully placed around the room harkening back to the venue's winery history. And, a sleek, contemporary bar featuring metal, quartz and dark wood is a statement piece in the room. Nestled in one corner of the Ballroom, a lounge allows guests to relax during the wedding. In addition, a wedding dressing suite with full private bathroom is also available for use.

**SERVICES OFFERED**

Wedding Packages include a course menu, 4.5-hours of full, open bar, day-of coordination services, service staff, and all the equipment needed to host your reception (tables, chairs, linens, place settings, and glassware). Other services, such as wedding cakes, mini desserts, and specialty rentals, are also offered. The Event Coordinators are also adept at hosting weddings with traditional elements or a fusion of cultures, such as Indian ceremonies, baraats, milinis, traditional 8-course banquets, coin, veil, and cord ceremonies, sofrehs, etc. Their knowledge of events is vast and the planning tools include an online portal and regular planning meetings to help couples feel relaxed on their wedding day knowing all the little details have been planned for and will be taken care of.

FLAWLESS Wedding Experience at Palm Event Center

We recently celebrated our wedding at the Palm Event Center, and we couldn't be happier with our choice! From the moment we stepped into the venue, we were blown away by its elegance and beauty. The decor was on point, creating the perfect ambiance for our special day.  
  
One of the highlights was the amazing food. Our guests couldn't stop raving about the ramen bar, churro station, and fries station. Each dish was more delicious than the last, adding a unique and memorable touch to our celebration.  
  
We loved the seamless experience provided by the Palm Event Center's preferred vendors. Every detail was flawlessly executed, making our wedding day stress-free and enjoyable. The online portal was a game-changer, allowing us to manage everything effortlessly.  
  
The Palm Event Center accommodated all our requests and our large guest count with ease. The entire event ran like a well-oiled machine, thanks to their impeccable organization and attention to detail.  
  
A special shoutout to our incredible coordinators, Nicole and August. They were absolute godsend, ensuring everything was on top of and that our day went off without a hitch. Their dedication and professionalism were truly remarkable.  
  
Thank you, Palm Event Center, for making our wedding day perfect. We highly recommend this beautiful venue to any couple looking for an unforgettable and flawless wedding experience!

Better than I Even Imagined!

We had our wedding here last month and it was so fantastic! Haley was our coordinator and she made sure everything was taken care of leading up to the wedding and everything went smoothly on the day. The staff was super professional food and drink service was great- guests told us it was some of the best wedding food they'd ever had. We even had wait staff following us around as we took some sunset photos after the ceremony with snacks and cocktails- such a thoughtful touch.  
The venue itself was beautiful so we didn't have to spend a ton of money on other decorations. We worked exclusively with their preferred vendors and all of them were amazing! Everyone here was fantastic, great with communication, and very professional. I highly recommend this venue if you want a beautiful, stress-free wedding!!

Casa Real and The Palm Event Center 

The attention to detail in every corner of Casa Real is remarkable. The well-manicured gardens and the enchanting courtyard create a romantic ambiance that is perfect for weddings and special events. The interior spaces are equally impressive, boasting a perfect blend of modern amenities and timeless elegance.  
  
But what truly sets Casa Real apart is the exceptional staff behind the scenes. Having witnessed the behind-the-scenes operations as a preferred vendor, I can attest to the professionalism and dedication of the staff. From the event coordinators to the catering team, everyone works seamlessly to ensure that every event at Casa Real is a truly memorable experience.

Great Venue, Great Customer Service

I have been fortunate to make my living as a professional photographer for over 3 decades, worked at countless venues all over the nation. Now base in Livermore CA, I feel extreme fortunate to be able to work at Palm Event Center. Palm Event Center hands down is one of the best wedding/event venues. The staff is top notch, truly focused on their clients and making the wedding/event run seamlessly! As a wedding/event photographer managing time, details, individuals, while still being creative is the goal at every wedding and event. This can be a challenge at times. One of the things that allows me to do my job more efficiently is have a supporting staff around me. The staff at Palm Event Center definitely fits this description! I know that when I have a wedding/event at Palm Event Center I am going to be working with the best! If you are considering wedding/event venues put Palm Event Center on top of your list. Beautiful venue, amazing food, and a staff that knows the meaning of great customer service!

GORGEOUS venue, amazing food, and perfect wedding location!

We had our wedding at the Palm Event Center in early June of this year and it truly was the absolute best day! From the beginning, the Palm was so easy to work with and made planning the wedding so effortless. They were quick to respond to emails or questions and executed everything perfectly the day of. As you get closer to the wedding date, you have a venue coordinator that is extremely helpful in organizing everything for the big day. The entire staff is so nice and kind and many of our friends/family even commented after of how kind the all of the venue staff were and how organized and on-top of everything was. The venue is also absolutely gorgeous! The surrounding vineyards, lush gardens, and renewed interior are stunning and our guests had nothing but positive things to say about how beautiful the venue was. Lastly, the food was absolutely AMAZING. If you are looking for amazing food from appetizers to late night snacks for you and your guests, this is absolutely the place! They also were so kind to place all the food and drinks on our sweetheart table so that we didn't have time to spend looking for appetizers or drinks, everything was right there for us to enjoy after visiting with our guests. Because they do weddings/events all the time, everything was so flawless, which allowed us to have a beautiful, stress-free, and truly perfect wedding day. We would 10/10 recommend the Palm Event Center to anyone looking to have an amazing wedding day from start to finish!

Palm Event Center made all of our guests rave about the best wedding they've ever attended!

My wife and I wanted to thank you all so much for being there for us on the best day of our lives (so far). We have had multiple friends and family come up to us to say it was the most beautiful reception they had ever been to, due in large to how beautiful Palm Event Center is, how well-coordinated the event was, and how welcoming all the staff members were. We couldn't have done it without all of you. So we wanted to thank each of you - Nicole for helping us get started and coordinating through the details, Genevieve for walking us through our planning journey and being so detail oriented (hope everything is going well with the new little one!), and finally Lexi for being there for us the weekend of.   
  
We couldn't think of a single thing that didn't go exactly as planned, and we couldn't have done it without the PEC team. The food was amazing, the wedding went EXACTLY AS PLANNED, and you gave us the wedding of our dreams! We cannot thank you enough for the absolutely perfect day in our lives.  
  
Davy and Elaine!

Golden, Dream October Wedding

We had our dream wedding at Palm Event on a warm, golden evening in October. The grape leaves were still green and the rose bushes were in full bloom! After finding this venue, we realized later that Palm Event Center is one of the highest rated wedding venues on Yelp (via Daily Meal). Don't do anymore research if you're looking for an organized, beautiful, breath-taking venue. We booked our wedding on a Thursday evening and from the day we put down our deposit, we were treated like royalty. Our coordinator, Genevieve, (shout-out to the most amazing person and best coordinator in the world!!), was organized, friendly, funny, kind and relatable. We met on Zoom for our check-ins, so no need to travel to Pleasanton. Then we had our FABULOUS food and wine tasting at the venue. Let me just say - all our our guests RAVED about their dishes on the day of the wedding. They couldn't say enough of how delicious, fresh, and wonderful their meal was. Then we treated our guests with a late night snack - pizza! It was truly perfect. Palm Event offers open bar, with a full well. We also designed signature cocktails and brought cases of Red Bull for our guests. Whenever we had questions, the team responded within 24 hours and were flexible about decor and desserts. All vendors have to provide insurance and we also bought couple's wedding insurance for the day of. Our rehearsal went without any hitches and Genevieve adjusted quickly and thoughtfully! She honestly made our day so enjoyable and stress-free. On the day of the wedding, there were some details that I wanted to change last minute with the decor and the team quickly adjusted to make our day perfect. I cannot recommend their team and kitchen staff enough! The best moments of our experience were high-quality service from the staff, beautifully maintained venue and winery (I mean the palm tree entrance itself is WOW), and the amazing food and drinks! Thank you Palm Event for making our wedding dreams come true.
