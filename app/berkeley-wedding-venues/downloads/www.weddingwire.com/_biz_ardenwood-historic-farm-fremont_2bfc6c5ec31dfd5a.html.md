An absolutely perfect day

The first word that comes to mind when I think of our experience with Ardenwood is "wow." My personal goal for our wedding was to keep things as low-stress as possible, and from our very first e-mail interactions with Claire and Stephanie, we knew we were going to be in good hands. They were super responsive, getting back to most of our e-mails in under 24 hours (honestly most messages received a response within about 2 hours), and responsiveness is HUGE when it comes to planning any event, especially a wedding, so it was amazing to have them in our corner throughout the whole process.  
First of all, if you've never toured the farm it's worth a visit even when you are not planning an event there. The grounds are gorgeous, and the farm has lots of weekend activities that are great for families. The options provided for the ceremony site are expertly chosen and make great backdrops for your photos. And the pool site reception area is secluded in such a way that you feel like you're entering a special secret woodland hideaway for dinner and dancing.  
We chose almost all of our vendors from their extensive list of recommendations, which left us with peace of mind knowing the people we were working with were already knowledgeable and comfortable in the venue space. It made coordination a breeze.  
They have a great menu to choose from for appetizers and dinner options (our guests are STILL talking about the ravioli almost 3 months later!), and the wait staff and bartenders were all so kind and amazing throughout the entire evening.   
The day-of coordination was spot-on. Stephanie and Claire kept me and my husband clued in throughout the day on our timeline and how things were going, and they ran a very tight ship without being "pushy." Everything went off without a hitch (or if there were any hitches, they were kind enough to not let me know about them LOL). In my personal and professional life I pride myself on being the kind of person who has their act together and is very organized, so I'm so glad we ended up with a venue and coordinating team that reflected those qualities, to the point that even our guests commented on how well the evening progressed through the different sections/activities.  
Overall our experience at Ardenwood was 10/10 and I'd highly recommend their site and services to anyone looking to have a beautiful and well-coordinated outdoor wedding. If I could, I'd do it all over again, and again and again ;)

Amazing venue with even better coordinators!

Ardenwood Farms was a beautiful venue for our wedding in September- perfect weather, the grounds were well maintained and there were even baby peacocks! But what set this venue apart for my husband and I was the dream team that made our wedding so seamless. Claire, Stephanie and Lindsey are not only incredibly sweet, responsive and organized, but they executed our day to perfection. They somehow managed to keep all the details straight, even when I changed my mind several times. They even went through the buffet line and brought the food to us so we could have a chance to sit and eat! The venue even makes it simple with so many aspects that you can rent: table numbers, heaters, lawn games, etc. It made wedding planning significantly less stressful, and they are happy to make recommendations when you get stuck. I could not recommend this venue more! Everyone raved about how perfect it was.

Took 70% of the stress away from wedding planning

Ardenwood was an amazing venue and made things so easy for my wife and I to plan our wedding this past August. The team behind the venue really made our lives so simple - you get so much value when you book with Ardenwood.   
The one thing we heard from all of our guests about our wedding was how good the food was - everyone kept asking who our vendor was. Ardenwood also has a great list of recommended vendors, which made planning even easier. Throughout the planning process, we worked really closely with Claire and Stephanie. They executed our vision perfectly and ensured the entire day flew by smoothly, allowing us to enjoy the day and not have to worry about anything else. Thanks to the team at Ardenwood for a stress free wedding!

Amazing! We loved every second of our wedding and Ardenwood is to thank! 

Every single step of planning was made easier with Claire and Stephanie. They made our dream wedding absolutely come true. I have compared with friends and by far, we had the calmest most organized and seamless wedding process thanks to the ardenwood staff. We are so thankful for them, and can’t thank them enough!!

Beautiful venue with great food

Ardenwood Farm is a beautiful place for wedding if you're looking for an outdoor, nature vibe, have enough parking space and a place that only host 1 wedding at a time. I have many guests complimenting the food was delicious and the nice warm setup. My wedding turned out to be awesome and I appreciated all the staffs' help on that day. The venue does have some restrictions such as preferred vendor list (you can pay extra and go through approval process if you want to hire your own), and limited time to put up the decoration before the ceremony starts. I did not hire vendors to do the decoration, so I had to be through and well prepared before the wedding and get enough helpers to make sure the decoration is done. I am sure if you hire a vendor, they will be able to get it done in time because they are more familiar with the venue. A big downside of using Ardenwood in my opinion is they take checks only. For events like this, we could have earned so much points by using credit card, but unfortunately, it is not an option. Overall, we had a great wedding and we were happy that we choose Ardenwood.

Literal Dream Come True!

The whole team at Ardenwood is absolutely fantastic! They made planning my wedding so easy, and my wedding day went of without a single issue! Claire, Stephanie, and Lindsey were the most wonderful people to work with and their communication throughout the whole process was unmatched (especially considering they helped me plan for almost 2 years!). From the attention to every little detail to the execution of the most wonderful day of my life, I literally cannot say enough to let the world know how amazing this team is. The venue is stunning on its own, but this team is what really made my day flawless; I actually got to enjoy the whole event without worrying about anything because I knew they had everything covered! I'm pretty sure they use literal magic here. If you're in the market for the most dreamy, fairytale venue and a team to match, look no further! Ardenwood will exceed every expectation!

Lovely July Wedding

We were very happy to have found Ardenwood and knew right after our tour that was where we wanted to get married. Communicating with the Ardenwood team was always a positive experience, they were very attentive and responsive, and everything was transparent throughout the process. As an LGBT couple, we felt welcomed by the Ardenwood team. We did not anticipate running into roadblocks securing and communicating with vendors (not Ardenwood directly), including some who were unprofessional or unresponsive. Ultimately we were able to find vendors that met our needs and happy with how things turned out. Our wedding day went extremely smoothly. We appreciated their attention to detail and we didn't have to worry about anything, we were able to focus on each other and our loved ones on our special day. We feel celebrated by the Ardenwood team and loved having our wedding there.

Fantastic venue & awesome coordinators!

Ardenwood was a fantastic venue for our wedding in September. The grounds are well-maintained and there is natural beauty everywhere!  
From our initial tour to the evening of our wedding, Claire and Stephanie were absolutely awesome to work with. They are both super professional, quick to respond to any of my million questions, organized, and friendly. Coming from a project management background, I was delighted and impressed with just how helpful they were in making sure our wedding was well-executed. They provided sample timelines, checklists, their own personal advice/recommendations...definitely went above and beyond. They also provide a list of in-house vendors, which made it easier for us to choose, and it helped that the vendors were familiar with the venue.  
I couldn't have asked for a better team, and I highly recommend this venue!

AMAZING! they made my dream wedding come true 

What makes this venue great, besides the scenery, is the team. The Ardenwood went above and beyond to make sure our big day was exactly what we imagined. They recommended amazing vendors and helped me when I was completely stumped on deserts. Not only did they help execute the big day, I feel like they truly care about their couples. They checked in with my husband and I to make sure we ate throughout the night and were enjoying ourselves. I couldn’t have asked for a better wedding. Thank you Ardenwood team!

Ardenwood is a Bay Area hidden gem! The property is expansive and there are so many options for set up. I love an outdoor venue with lots of natural light and beautiful landscaping and if thats what your looking for, Ardenwood is the venue for you. Lindsey was so kind and easy to work with... I can't wait to hopefully book more weddings here in 2018!

Ardenwood is one of my favorite wedding venues to photograph. There are so many little pockets to tuck in to to get gorgeous photos. The ceremony sites and reception areas are so pretty! Not to mention, Lindsey is a blast to work with! All of the staff there is tremendously accommodating and you can really tell that they all love what they do.
