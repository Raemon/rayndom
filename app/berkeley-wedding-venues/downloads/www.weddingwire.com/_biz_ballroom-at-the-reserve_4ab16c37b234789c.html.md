Beautiful Venue

Everything about The Ballroom was perfect! Julie was so helpful to work with leading up to the day and even more so the day off. We received so many compliments from guests how beautiful the space was and perfectly sized to hold everything in one spot. The location is great for outdoor pictures options as well.

A Hidden Gem

We debated between a few different venues but there was something so special about the Reserve. The renovated space had the exact style and amenities we were looking for. We loved that there was a brewery (Lion's Tail) on the first floor because it gave another dimension to the day and the newly renovated Doubletree hotel right next store eliminated the need for shuttles at the end of the night! People kept saying how surprised and impressed they were - they had no idea this place was hidden downtown Neenah! After we made our decision we started working with Jess and ended with Justun and Julie after the transition and everything went so smoothly. They were responsive, detail oriented, and all-around wonderful people to work with. One example: we put on our own "coffee bar" with dessert and it went over way better than planned...when we ran out of coffee, Justun offered to run and get more for us! You can really tell that they love what they do - 5 stars!

Wonderful spot!

I’ve been a wedding photographer in Neenah for over a decade and this is one of my favorite spots to photograph.  
  
It has unique light fixtures along with a really classy gathering space. The whole building is a throwback to a much earlier time in the 20th century.  
  
I’d highly recommend you check this out.

Beautiful Historic Venue

Amazing wedding venue. We worked with Jess and she was a great positive energy. We loved the freedom we were given with the venue (choosing whatever catering company we wanted, choosing our own liquor vendor bring your own alcohol, etc). It is rare to find venues that allow this much freedom on your wedding day. The womens prep room before the wedding was amazing for photos while the girls got ready. They have an elevator which is a bonus for older guests.   
  
Definitely recommend this beautiful venue. I hope this follows the same direction and service as it looks like there is new owners since I had my wedding here in 2018.
