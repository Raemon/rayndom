4.8 out of 5 rating 

4.8 

We only have positive things to say about Gilmore Catering and the service they provided at our wedding, for both cocktail hour and our plated dinner service. With planning, the team was organized, provided clear direction and were attentive to details. Our guests were quick to mention how delicious their meals were, which is a high compliment to Gilmore Catering since many of our guests live in large metropolitan cities and have quite sophisticated palettes. Gilmore also impressed me with how proactive and attentive they were to dietary needs (e.g. gluten, dairy, food dyes), which were handled with ease and guests were able to enjoy the evening as a result. Highly recommend!

Whether they’re slinging pies or cooking up bbq, Sly Fox always brings the flavor. If you see their truck parked in front of your favorite bar or at at event, pull over immediately and get ready to be delighted.

We used Pigs Eatin' Ribs to cater our wedding welcome/rehearsal dinner at Depot Beach Pavilion. They brought the food truck to us and served up an absolutely delicious spread! People told us they liked the novelty of the food truck and we had numerous people tell us how much they enjoyed the food! The service was fast and friendly as well. Booking the vendor went smoothly. They clearly answered any questions we had in a timely manner (few days at the most). They were pretty laid back and easily accommodated our requests for vegetarian meals, etc. They have done this enough that nothing seems to phase them! When we did the tasting, even the vegetarian option (black bean tacos) was incredibly tasty! The die hard meat-eaters in the group even noted they enjoyed it! I had originally thought the name and type of food were a little too casual and plain for a wedding, but I'm so glad we looked into them further! The food is top notch and delicious! We will be making a pit stop there any time we are up that way! If you are in the area (regardless of whether you are looking for a caterer), do yourself a favor and stop by!!

Distinctive Catering did not disappoint! Drinks came out quickly, pours seemed reasonable. Very accommodating group that did a great job with our specialty drinks (named after our cats). I would recommend them for anyone's wedding.

Kristina’s catering did our wedding at the Ford Piquette Plant and it was absolutely amazing! The team made sure my groom and I ate and everyone raved about the food. It all tasted absolutely incredible and even the leftover meal we had tasted amazing the next day! Could not recommend them enough!

Angels food catered my husband and I’s wedding and they did an exceptional job. The process of planning the menu was very thorough and enjoyable. The food was amazing and our guests are still raving about it even after the event. The carrot cake was so delicious and the design was executed spot on. We couldn’t be more happier! Judy and her team are very professional and put so much care and effort into their work. We will definitely be using Angels food catering for future events going forward.

KJs catered our wedding at The Lake House on 9/24/22 and we had so many guest raving about the food! We chose to do the pulled pork, Marbella chicken, white cheddar mac and cheese, green beans, and a salad. It was all phenomenal! The mac and cheese was the star of the show! KJs was wonderful to work with and they were flexible with menu changes even when we got in to wedding week. Their staff was also amazing helping our guests at the buffet line and coming around and clearing tables. We could not recommend them enough!

When I was researching caterers and came across Vassel's, they sounded too good to be true. All of the reviews I read were glowing, and the prices were far lower than anything else in the area. We booked Vassel's after our first meeting with Darren because he made us feel so calm and comfortable. He helped my husband and I and my parents through all aspects of the catering and event rentals, and had several sound recommendations when we were confused or unsure of what to do. You can tell that he loves what he does and really wants to make your event the best it can be. He definitely didn't push us toward unnecessary expenses and always gave his honest opinion. The day of the wedding everything was handled professionally and unobtrusively, and the food was fantastic ... we're still getting compliments. We were confident that everything was in good hands, and we weren't disappointed. I'm not sure I can say enough good things. Strongly recommend!

I can’t put into words how thankful I am that I chose Classic Catering to cater my wedding. They were very organized, helpful, kind and supportive. They made my day flow so smoothly, I truly had no worries. I was able to have my dream wedding because of them! The staff is very easy to get along with and they are experienced in knowing what to suggest to use for decor to meet your vision and budget. Not only was the catering amazing being able to get my floral arrangements through Petals once again made my day beyond beautiful and easy!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND

They are very customer friendly and delicious! They set up and took down, cleaned up any trash that was laying around and walked around talking to guests and making sure everyone was OK and didn't need anything!
