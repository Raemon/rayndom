I wish I could give a million stars to Adventures on the Gorge (AOTG)! AOTG and the staff are beyond incredible!! Jessica, the wedding venue coordinator, is amazing to work with. The venue is gorgeous, but Jessica is the real reason why booking a wedding here is the smartest move you could possibly make! She and the entire staff are so kind and helpful! Even though she is the venue coordinator, I was able to call her and ask her advice about anything wedding related during our 1.5 year planning process because she has planned so many weddings, she just knows what works and what doesn't. Even though she's so busy, she always finds a way to make time to help. She was indispensable during our planning process & wedding weekend, and we could not have planned the wedding of our dreams without her. We truly trusted Jessica, which made the actual wedding weekend way more fun and stress-free for us than it normally is. The first time we visited AOTG, Jessica gave us a grand tour of the entire property. She showed us all the possible locations we could have various wedding events, she even showed us the inside of some unrented cabins and vacation homes so we could decide where we and our family/friends should stay. She gave this tour to us when various family could join FOUR different times, how above and beyond is that?! We also wanted to have a whole weekend of events for our wedding to spend a lot of quality time with our guests and also be around nature because we are very outdoorsy. However, not all our guests are outdoorsy, and we found that AOTG was the perfect balance between beautiful scenery/nature and resort/luxury amenities. The "cabins" aren't your stereotypical cabins, the are luxury cabins and worth every penny! Having us and guests stay on the resort allowed us to spend even more quality time with guests because it was so easy for guests to come over to our cabin and gather around the firepit and hot tub. Everyone could walk or take the shuttle to all the wedding events, so we didn't have to worry about a thing. The shuttle drive, Dee, is so kind and incredible. She took care of everyone! Plus, AOTG made it so easy for guests to book various adventures. We had a rafting trip for guests, which is offered at discounted price for wedding groups, and it was such a hit! Even some friends and family that normally are NOT adventurous decided to go and everyone had the best time. Everything at AOTG exceeded my expectations. All the staff are so kind and everyone truly wants you to have an amazing wedding. The thing that stands out about AOTG and Jessica, is that they really take care of absolutely everything during your wedding, so you can actually enjoy it! You can be as involved in the details as you choose. We were very involved, and Jessica made sure to understand what we wanted and made it happen. The food is also amazing - blown away by how good the hors d'oeuvres and buffet food was. Bartenders and drinks were awesome as well. We had Meet & Greet at Rendezvous Pavilion, which is such a cool and fun space - we didn't need any decorations. The ceremony was on the deck behind Smokey's and is just gorgeous - surrounded by trees but on a nice decking (best of both worlds). The reception was around the pool, which is gorgeous at night and the view behind the upper deck is beautiful. Everything that you get at AOTG for your wedding and having Jessica as the coordinator makes the price extremely reasonable!! Book this place if you can!!!!

We originally planned to get married in 2020 but due to COVID-19 we had to push it back to 2021, Kelly helped us reschedule our reception and it was all worth the wait. Stonewall staff did an amazing job with from our guests stay, the rehearsal dinner and meal for the reception. Our guest complimented us on quality of food and were they were able accommodate people with dietary restrictions (vegan and food allergies). We held our reception at Lightburns which is such a beautiful space, with awesome views of the resort and lake. The service staff were expedient serving our sit down meal. At one point one of young guest disappeared (we thought) and they dropped everything to help us search, it was so enlightening to see their concern for the situation. The staff never give the impression that they wanted us to wrap up even as we went late into the evening. We are looking forward to coming back for our anniversary.

The grass was mowed perfectly! The pavillion was clean and very well taken care of. There were lots of bugs but not much you can do about that in the summer time!

The park superintendent is very easy to work with. He met us at 6 pm in the rain to look at the location and let us look around as long as we wanted. He is very flexible with the payment plan as well. As long as you pay the deposit within a month of receiving the contract you have until 30 days before the event to pay the remaining balance. He will work with you on a payment plan the works for you. The deposit is $200, the fee for the gazebo rental plus 50 chairs is only $250. You get the gazebo for the entire day (starting and ending with the parks opening and closing hours) and they set up your chairs for you day of. Additional chairs can also be rented as well as a 10x10 tent for dressing. There are shelters available that are very close to the gazebo if you want an outdoor reception as well. The one we chose has a fire place and is $40 for the entire day.

We had our wedding a Serenity Point and it was absolutely amazing. Devon was super helpful leading up to the event in booking and planning times and the rehearsal. Once we got there, the staff was very helpful in making sure the venue was private so campground visitors couldn’t bother us during the ceremony. Susan was in contact with me all day and was super flexible in getting all the guests and bridal party where they needed to be. She made sure we were on time and even helped me with my gown! The background was beautiful and I can’t wait to see our photos. We did have some surprise audience in their boats on the lake but a friend got some pictures from that angle which was cool! The price was well worth it and we would highly recommend.
