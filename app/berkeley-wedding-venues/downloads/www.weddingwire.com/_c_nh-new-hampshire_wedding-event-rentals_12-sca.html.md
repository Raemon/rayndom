We hired special events of NE for our wedding October 6, 2024. We got the dessert plates, large dinner plates and rust/amber goblets. They delivered them a few days in advance and picked them up. I coordinated with Robert S. and he was great. I never had to worry about my rental with them. We would recommend them to anyone!

Working with Sheena at Showcase Events for my September 2024 wedding in Tamworth, NH was the BEST! Every question I had was answered quickly from the day we started working with her, and her recommendations were fantastic. I can't say enough good things about how smooth everything went on our wedding day! Her attention to detail and knowledge of the industry was so reassuring and she made planning and the day itself a stress-free, wonderful occasion. Our entire wedding weekend was so special and we could never have pulled it off without Sheena's help!

Seacoast did an awesome job for our wedding! Our venue was a little complicated, but they visited in person and scouted it out ahead of time to confirm that our tent would fit. Their team came the day of the wedding and set up the tent very quickly - like, under two hours for a 40x80 tent. It was impressive. Most other tent vendors we spoke with estimated set-up times two or three times longer than that. The tent itself looked amazing, especially when it was lit up at night (they supplied the lights). Seacoast also supplied our chairs and heaters, which was a huge plus. In the months and weeks leading up to the wedding, they were responsive and very flexible, which made it much less stressful to plan. We mostly worked with Whitney throughout the planning process and she was fantastic. Prices were also very reasonable. We loved working with Seacoast and would highly recommend!

I had Devine Linens do my chair covers with a navy bow for my wedding. They also did the tablecloths for the cake and sweetheart tables. The room was so elegant. I hadn’t planned on doing the chair covers but I’m so glad I did. The room was so romantic.

Jen was very friendly, professional and responsive to my rental needs. All of my linens were free as part of my wedding venue package except for the table runners, which were very affordable so I didn't mind paying for them at all. The fabric was high quality and all the linens were delivered in perfect condition. I highly recommend considering Perfect Parties for any rentals you need.

We worked with Revelry Event Collection/Sperry Tents Seacoast to rent a 46x106 sailcloth tent, along with chairs, tables, a round bar, and several other pieces for our August North Shore wedding. Everything they provided was beautiful and elevated the entire event. The tent and décor created such an inviting, memorable atmosphere—it truly transformed the space into something special. I highly recommend working with them!

We're so glad we worked with Sperry Seacoast for our wedding. Jessica responded promptly and kindly to our hundreds of questions and modifications! She’s organized and experienced with her business. Everything in our order was high quality and delivered on time even though we made last minute changes. We loved how everything looked! We would recommend an initial call with Jessica to plan and understand the scope and budget of the event so there are no surprises. Everything was beautiful and it was the perfect night!
