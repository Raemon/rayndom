Rudy was awesome to work with. I have a secret timeline because I was doing a surprise dress change and he was so flexible to keep the secret and make sure the timing of his music worked with the entrance of my new dress. He answered any and all questions we had and he was so helpful in any times we didn't have a song or just had a question about something. So friendly to work with and he made sure everyone was up and dancing during our special night!

Had an absolutely phenomenal time working with Scott for our wedding. He was attentive, always responsive, very accommodating to our wacky music tastes, and an all-around fun and friendly person to work with. Incredibly pleasant to talk to, asks loads of questions about our musical interests, and happily worked with our officiant to make transitions and timing seamless. DJs are an eclectic bunch, and not all of them are easy to work with, but the first time you hear Scott on the other end of the phone, you’ll know what you’re in for: a calm-but-energetic person who’s wholeheartedly invested in making your wedding a joyous event. Ten stars out of five.

Absolutely incredible. If you're looking for rental for your wedding. Just book B_entertained. From the moment we reached out, their team made everything feel easy. Like really easy. Professional, responsive, and most importantly they listened. No upselling. No pressure. Just honest, experienced advice and flawless execution. We rented the full setup: tent, tables, chairs, linens, dance floor, photo booth, and string lights. Every piece was spotless, sturdy, elegant. The tent felt like a dream, clean and white, perfectly set up, and big enough to comfortably hold our guests (and then some). Tables and chairs? Classic and cozy. Not one wobbly leg or creaky seat. The linens matched our colors to a T. Crisp. Fresh. Ironed. I didn’t even know that mattered until I saw how beautiful everything looked put together. Then the string lights came on. And wow. That beautiful glow added a magical touch. Like a warm hug across the whole space. It turned our outdoor reception into a soft-lit fairytale. The dance floor was sturdy and smooth, perfect for heels, sneakers, and a few surprise breakdance moves. It held up all night without a single hiccup. And the photo booth was a huge hit. Our guests were obsessed. So many laughs. So many memories printed instantly. The props were clean and fun, and the photos looked amazing. They arrived on time. Set everything up perfectly. Double-checked with us throughout and all done with a smile. I honestly can’t recommend B_entertained enough. If you want a seamless, beautiful, no-stress rental experience that elevates your day, they are def it. Book them. You’ll thank me later.

We are so happy we found the Collins Entertainment team for our wedding day! DJ Charlie was an awesome teammate in our planning process and made us feel at ease from start to finish on the big day. From the initial coordination with Mitch, to emailing back and forth with Mitch, the owner Jim, and Charlie to address our questions, to the respect for our song requests and capturing our overall theme, we were really pleased throughout. We appreciated the event planning platform, which forced us to think through all of the questions that a DJ, the Master of Ceremonies, really needs to know to make an event successful. The Collins team also sends periodic wedding countdown reminder e-mails that are extremely helpful and ensured that we were doing the right things at the right time. We only had two minor complaints. First, we were unhappy that one profane rap song made it into the dancing portion of the night - which in fairness may have been requested by one of our family members - but it really threw off the vibe for us for a couple of minutes (especially because we had a lot of family and older guests in attendance). Not sure if others noticed it as much, as the dancing continued regardless. Second, the website platform is a little unintuitive, and could probably use an update in the next few years: the site is also not integrated with any music platform (like Spotify or YouTube), which made it a little cumbersome to toggle between browser windows. Our ceremony was extremely important to us, and we were nervous about it because it was outdoors and we weren’t entirely sure how the acoustics and electrical setup would work at the venue. Charlie made sure that the prelude and processional music and ceremony audio were perfectly timed, at the right volume, and that the microphone and other equipment were functional without interruption. While it’s probably an industry standard, we still truly appreciated that Charlie matched our dress code for the wedding, and looked super sharp in his suit despite the August weather and the air conditioning failing in the reception area just before the wedding! Charlie captured our requested music themes for the cocktail hour and throughout the reception, made the right introductions and announcements throughout. He did a fantastic job of reading the room and keeping things moving, and provided the exact level of interaction and number of announcements that we were hoping for. It all felt very natural. People danced throughout, despite it being hot in the building, and Charlie kept everybody moving and built off our requested playlist very well. We were also so glad we chose the uplighting option - it made the reception area look so much better as the evening progressed, and we couldn’t imagine the space without that detail. We were really going for a classy, timeless wedding day, and Charlie and the Collins Entertainment team did a phenomenal job of making that a reality. They paid attention to the details, were extremely professional yet relatable, and demonstrated skill in their craft. We’ve been to so many weddings and the choice of a DJ can really make or break the day. If we had to do it all over again, we would choose Collins Entertainment for our wedding every time, and we strongly recommend their services to anyone planning a wedding or event!

We reached out to DJ Marty after seeing the rave reviews. Although he was not available for our date, he connected us with DJ Donny. We could not be happier with how the event turned out. From the tasteful up-lighting, to the smooth transitions between events, Donny proved to be an absolute professional and was quick to adapt. He was energetic, a great speaker, and was able to keep the crowd engaged and excited through the entire night. To say our dance floor was popping is an understatement. The one thing we appreciated the most was that although we had a schedule of events, Donny and the day of coordinator were able to gently nudge us towards each event without us feeling pressured or rushed. On top of all of that, the mirror photobooth was a guest favorite. We had tons of fun joining guests in the photos as well as looking back at the scrap book that was put together at the very end. Thanks for a wonderful night to remember!

Rico was nothing short of incredible! From the moment the music started to the very last song, he created the perfect atmosphere and kept the energy high the entire night. He read the crowd perfectly, played all of our must-haves, and mixed in his own songs that had everyone on the dance floor. He was professional, fun, and so easy to work with. He coordinated seamlessly with our timeline and other vendors, and his setup looked and sounded amazing. The transitions were smooth, the vibes were on point, and the dance floor was never empty! We got so many compliments from our guests about how great the music was, and we couldn’t agree more. Truly one of the best decisions we made for our big day. Highly recommend Rico Events!

Ronnie and his team were amazing. They absolutely nailed it, hitting on everything we had asked for. Ronnie listened to all our wants and needs and made sure to curate the night based on that. It was easy to get in touch with him and he was quick to respond throughout the process. We were able to put together our own personal playlist and Ronnie respected our wishes and didn’t deviate. He crushed the execution and we had people on the dance floor all night, which is exactly what we wanted. He also hooked us up with a saxophonist who was phenomenal. Highly recommend Ronnie and the Musically Yours team. They’re the best.

We hired DJ Jeremy & Sara for our wedding, and we couldn’t have been happier! From our very first conversation, they were professional, responsive, and genuinely excited about helping us create the perfect vibe for our big day. They took the time to understand our music tastes and built a playlist that kept the dance floor full all night. They also handled all the announcements and timing perfectly, working smoothly with our planner and other vendors so everything felt effortless. Highly recommend!
