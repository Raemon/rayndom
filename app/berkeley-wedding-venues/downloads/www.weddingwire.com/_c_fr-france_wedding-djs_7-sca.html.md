Just want to say a huge thank you Wildfire DJ's for making our wedding so memorable. Their service was amazing and Connor was brilliant. Everything ran so smoothly and the contact before and after was really appreciated.

Loïc and his colleague are extremely professional. We highly recommend them. We had the best evening of our lives. Loïc was able to adapt to all our constraints. He arrived well in advance to prepare everything as best as possible, and the exchange was so fluid and easy that we felt like he was one of our guests. Loic knows how to adapt to the emotions in the room at all times to adjust the music. Thank you for being a key person in the success of our wedding. We didn't see the time fly by. Everyone, young and old alike, was charmed by your work and found themselves on the dance floor ! I recommend Loic if you want a perfect event.

We both want to say an absolutely HUGE thanks to Damien and all the team at Riviera Sounds. They totally smashed it! From the moment we got in touch their communication and level of service was impeccable and such a relief. We were coming from abroad to get married in the south of France and didn't have a clue where to start, but it was so obvious from the start that we were in the right hands. Our wedding party was insane and everyone is still talking about it now! Myself and Ben wanted to thank you again and we can't wait to see you again next year (recommended for Dave and Clement's wedding in 2021!!)

From the moment we found Magic Event, we knew it was going to be the right fit for us. Cyril delivered everything we could have asked for. The party was perfect, the dance floor was so energetic! We got complimented all night on the music from cocktail hour to the end of the night. Cyril was so professional and we knew we were in good hands especially when he gave suggestions on songs to consider and what kind of songs to start with to ensure everyone was on the dance floor. I loved his passion for his craft the most. He was genuinely excited to play music for us and that made us that more excited to trust him to bring the magic! We would highly recommend Cyril for any event and hope to be able to work with him again soon!
