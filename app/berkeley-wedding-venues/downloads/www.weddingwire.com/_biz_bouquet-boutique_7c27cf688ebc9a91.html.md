Loved them!

From the first consultation to my wedding day, everything was a dream! They made everything so easy, I had nothing to worry about. Allie was on top of things and made my experience such a good one!

Bethany is so personable and helpful! From the moment we met with her she offered advice, contacts and support. She called me several times throughout our engagement always offering emotional support through a stressful time! Our wedding ceremony actually didn't begin until 5 hours after the shop closed and she still made it a priority to come out on her evening off to deliver direct to our venue! When I saw the flowers on the wedding day, I was stunned with how beautiful they were, and suddenly wished that I had bought a toss bouquet, they were so stunning! Very helpful, flexible to change, knowledgeable (I knew nothing about flowers) and supportive!
