This is a good place for a wedding and reception because of its amazing historical nature, Fred Astaire actually danced on the floor here, and also because it is a nice place for guests to be able to walk around and see all the different exhibits and there are nice areas outside as well.

We held our wedding reception at the Cider Gallery in September and couldn't have asked for a better day. Coco was SO helpful throughout planning, and the venue was so incredibly easy to work with not to mentions GORGEOUS! I can't imagine our wedding anywhere else!

I just had my reception with MOWT and it was more than I could have ever asked for. They go over the table arrangement you want and have it all set up for you when you get there to decorate. They were so helpful and so easy to work with. The price is amazing for what you get. There are only bathrooms on the second floor and the reception area is on the third floor. That was the only downside, but other than that we LOVED it.

The value you get having your wedding at the Exploration Place is great but make sure to check on a few things. My wedding was scheduled in 2018 and 1 month before we found out there was an event scheduled for the same night as our wedding. It rained so much the event got canceled that day so it all turned out ok but this caused a lot of extra stress and issues because we thought we had to avoid a certain entrance because of people and food trucks being there. Also, the lights in waterway hall do not turn off. They will say you can dim them but they do not dim enough. If you are dancing it WILL be bright I can guarantee you that. We asked and asked and the staff said that the main lights have to stay on for fire hazard? So basically you might be dancing in -slightly dimmed but not really - light. Other than that, it was beautiful and looked fancy. All my guests seemed to like it but this is stuff I noticed.

Absolutely beautiful event space !! Everyone was so helpful and professional. Emailed me w a floor plan, details - very open communication and quick response. Food was the best we have had at an event like this ! I would highly recommend the Wichita Art Museum for a venue space. We loved it and so did our guests.
