Wonderful, Organized, Perfect! 

Juniper Hotel is a wonderful venue conveniently located in the heart of Silicon Valley. From the beginning, planning our wedding reception with Juniper Hotel has been a dream! Audrey, the hotel wedding coordinator has been a pleasure to work with in every way, and has been very helpful especially during COVID. From our food tasting, each dish was meticulously prepared and scrumptious. We highly recommend this venue for any other couple.

Intimate Wedding

We had an intimate wedding reception in their Parkview room. The room view was spectacular and we were served a wonderful 3 course meal for our 25 guests. A big thanks to all of the banquet servers and planners for making it so easy.

Wedding extraordinary! 

As a wedding planner working with Juniper Hotel was an absolutely incredible experience. Kris (the venue coordinator) has been so responsive and helpful through the entire process as we planned a full wedding in 2 months! She genuinely wants to make your event perfect. The entire process of planning was so easy – made seamless by Kris (who is also hard-working and very sweet). She made every effort to accommodate my couple in every way to make it the most special day for them. She was always quick to respond, making communication simple. All aspects of the contract were clearly explained, During the reception, the staff were amazing and kind to everyone! I cannot recommend this venue, and all of it’s staff, enough! Thank you for everyone at Juniper's hotel for all your hard work!!

Wedding @ Juniper Cupertino

Kris T helped my wife and I put together our dream wedding. Everything went better than we could have imagined. Kris and the Juniper team was always available and was promptly responsive to all of our questions. They also took extra care to in setting up our decorations and our ceremony and reception sites.   
  
The rooms and Hilton hotel experience were excellent. A common compliment we received after the event was about how much the venue was, including the rooms, food, and services. We’re so thankful and we totally recommend you to check them out!

Wedding Reception at Juniper Hotel

Our wedding day was phenomenal. Juniper really made our wedding day special. All of our families really enjoyed themselves and had tons of fun. We are really happy that we chose Juniper for our reception. All of you guys were outstanding even after the reception was over. If we could do it again, we would definitely do it at Juniper.

Excellent Wedding HQ with Juniper Hotels

Audrey Hahn and the staff at the Juniper were top-notch. They always responded quickly, made sure we got the best deals, helped us out with our changing numbers and logistics. and the venue was incredible. The rooms were clean and spacious, everyone had what they needed to prepare. And the close proximity access to two green spaces meant that our guests with Pets had great access to be outside and that we could host COVID-safe events. Overall, a great experience.

Wonderful Hotel, Great Silicon Valley Location

We set up a block of rooms for our out of town wedding guests. The Juniper Hotel is conveniently located, nearly multiple restaurants and shopping, - and the staff goes above board. our guests raved about the venue and location. The rooftop honey hives are an unexpected treat, make sure your guests try a drink or get pancakes made from the honey! We worked with Audrey as our sales manager, she was highly responsive and worked so hard for us. Highly Recommend the Juniper Hotel for weddings, reunions and just a staycation!
