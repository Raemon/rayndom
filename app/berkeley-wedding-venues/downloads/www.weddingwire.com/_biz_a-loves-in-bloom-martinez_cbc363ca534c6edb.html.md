Beautiful flowers!

Valerie did such an excellent job for our wedding! She was communicative, responsive, and really listened/asked good questions to understand the vision I had in mind. The flowers at our ceremony site and my bouquet turned out beautiful just how I had imagined. She’s also reasonably priced, professional, and good quality!

A floral dream come true!

Valarie was one of my absolute favorite people that I worked with throughout my entire wedding planning journey. She was consistently kind, prompt, professional, and went way over and above to make sure our flowers were exactly what we wanted. She patiently answered all of my many questions about different flowers and seasonality, and the end result was everything I could’ve dreamed of. I loved the flowers so much that I dried a few of the bouquets and get to still appreciate in my home today, 6 months after our wedding. I truly could not recommend working with Val high enough!

Wedding florals

Valarie is such a joy to work with, from our first meeting to our last, and everything in between! She truly enjoys her work and it is exemplified in the beautiful arrangements that she creates. Val is a great listener of our vision, and I could not have been happier with the end result. I highly recommend Val and her team for your wedding floral arrangements... You will not be disappointed!

Wonderful Florist

A Love's in Bloom was on the preferred vendor list from our venue, Boundary Oak. After contacting several vendors, it was an easy choice to go with Valerie. From the onset, she took the time to understand the bride's vision. The arrangements were not only stunning but unique, creative and beautiful. The bride's bouquet was absolutely perfect. She and her team worked seamlessly with the venue (Boundary Oak) and we were able to repurpose many of the arrangements from the ceremony to the reception allowing us to keep the pricing well within our budget. Valerie's attention to detail was amazing and her commitment to quality was outstanding. We couldn't have been happier with the flowers and arrangements that Valerie provided!

Fantastic florist!

Valarie did beautiful flower arrangements for my wedding. My bouquet was to die for! From the colors, the style, and smell of the roses she put together. She put my vision to live! And was better than I expected. She listened and was thoughtful in all my flower arrangements questions and answered all my questions with kindness and patience. It was such a magical day for me and my now husband. I am so grateful to Valarie and her staff in A love's in bloom for her work and dedication! I highly recommend her service!

Beautiful Florals & Wonderful Service-Highly Recommend!

A Love’s in Bloom was on the preferred vendor list at our venue (Boundary Oak), and I’m so glad we chose to work with them! Valerie was incredibly friendly and helpful throughout the entire process. I sent her a photo of my dress, and she gave thoughtful guidance on bouquet colors and shape to complement it perfectly.  
  
  
  
Their pricing was very reasonable, and I ended up ordering my bouquet, boutonnières, corsages, three floral arrangements for the ceremony arch, eucalyptus leaves for part of our reception centerpieces, and gutted rose petals. Everything turned out absolutely beautiful and truly brought our vision to life.  
  
I would absolutely use A Love’s in Bloom again for any future events. Thank you, Valerie and team, for making our day so special!

Beautiful wedding flowers from experienced, flexible, and communicative professional florist

Valarie created us the most BEAUTIFUL flower arrangements for our wedding day recently! Everything was PERFECT!!! We loved every arrangement, bouquet, centerpiece, garland, everything! It truly contributed to the elegance to the wedding and natural beauty of the venue (Hacienda de las Flores by Wedgewood Weddings). Valarie was highly communicative and flexible, working with us up to days before the wedding to ensure our vision came to life. We appreciated how transparent and honest she was about style, colors, and pricing. Thank you, Valarie!

Stunning Flowers

A Love’s In Bloom was a recommendation from a friend, and we were so pleased with how all the florals at our wedding turned out. We worked with a planner who did a majority of our communications with Valarie, so we didn’t talk to her too much personally. We had special requests for our arrangements and – after just a bit of miscommunication that got ironed out quickly – they turned out precisely like we envisioned. A Love’s In Bloom does beautiful work for a very reasonable price. We couldn’t have been happier!

So happy she was my florist!

I recently got married through Wedgewood Weddings and had Valarie as my florist vendor. From the moment we first met, she was so nice, professional and attentive to my floral vision. I knew after our first meeting, I was in the right hands. Even after receiving our draft quote, I was able to breath a sigh of relief at how affordable her prices were. Leading up to the wedding, she was great with communicating other details which were needed and even sent a sneak peak photo of my floral arrangement. The day of the wedding, I was able to see everything come together and the florals/arrangements were an absolute dream come true. She took my floral vision and made it come to life. I could not have been happier with the way it all turned out and cannot thank Valarie enough for making it all happen. I would highly recommend her!

Beautiful florals

Valerie was very professional and easy to work with. The florals she provided were amazing. She really listened to what I wanted and delivered. She was always very accommodating and responsive even when I changed my mind a few times about what I wanted. Definitely would recommend working with her!
