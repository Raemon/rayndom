As a professional wedding DJ, I have yet to stumble into a colleague with half of the professionalism and raw talent as Zach. It’s far too often in our industry that we hear horror stories of the DJ that shows up for somebody’s wedding just to make the entire night about themselves. We absolutely despise this trait, and Zach has taught me and so many of our fellow wedding DJs about what it means to embody the ultimate emcee- the person who can hold the microphone and still shine a spotlight on what is really important- the bride and groom. I look forward to the day he DJs my wedding. I cannot recommend him enough- do yourself a favor and reach out to Zach and French Industries if you need a DJ.

We booked DJ Sound Productions & LLC after an online search. They were quick to respond to our request, gave us all the information right away, and were extremely pleasant to communicate with, so we booked them right away. Ours was a multicultural wedding at Aster Cafe and we had many Indian guests as well as American guests. Our biggest concern was whether the DJ would be able to bring the different groups together on the dance floor, but DJ Dave was absolutely amazing! He had EVERYONE on the dance floor for three Bollywood songs back to back. Throughout the night he was good at assessing who was on the dance floor and adapted the music based on that. Our guests had a great time on the dance floor and we couldn't be happier. Would highly recommend this company!

Tony was such a great DJ for our special day! From showing up early to set up, taking charge of the reception, and handling song requests perfectly… we could never have wished for a better DJ. Thank you so much Tony for making our wedding night one to remember for all of the guests!! Highly recommend!!

DJ Daniel P is the DJ you want for your wedding! Not only with keeping everyone on the dance floor all night long as the best DJ; but also throughout the day with keeping everything on time, touching base so we knew the plan, and preparing our family for exactly what the speeches were going to look like and what to do. I spent our entire wedding day in the moment without a care in the world because of our vendors, like Daniel, who took care of everything and I never had to think twice about it. Daniel got everyone on the dance floor, played music for all to enjoy, and really was just the life of the party. I think he enjoyed DJing as much as we enjoyed being there (which was A LOT)! If you need a wedding DJ, Daniel P is your guy!

Richard did an amazing job as our wedding DJ. I was personally worried, as a person with very specific music tastes, that my vision would get lost when it came to the music played at the wedding. But I didn't have to worry, as Richard really listened and was able to bring both my vision to life while also keeping the dancefloor hot. He was super flexible day-of in terms of timing changes we had to make due to an earlier reception than expected and had a ton of great suggestions that really brought our ceremony and reception to life. Also, over and above, he took videos that he shared with us of different fun moments on the dancefloor and ended the set with a surprise moment that brought all the remaining guests together in a way everybody thought was beautiful. Richard also was having a great time, I would often see him rocking out behind his set-up! Much recommended!!!

We had an absolutely amazing experience with Sounds Unlimited for our daughter's wedding, and especially with our DJ, Corey. From start to finish, he brought such great energy and professionalism to our wedding. Corey was incredibly interactive with the crowd—he knew exactly how to read the room, kept the dance floor full all night, and made sure every moment flowed seamlessly. He checked in with us throughout the event and made the transitions feel effortless. Multiple guests commented on how fantastic the music was and how much they loved his enthusiasm. If you’re looking for a DJ who is organized, engaging, and genuinely invested in making your day memorable, Corey at Sounds Unlimited is the one. Highly recommended!

Midwest Sound is a reliable, well-established DJ company that did a great job for our wedding reception! They coordinated well with us and our reception venue coordinator to make sure cocktail hour, dinner service, speeches, and first dances went smoothly. They were easy to work with ahead of time as well, and accommodated our special requests, including our specific song needs for our mother-son and father-daughter dances. Highly recommend!

Both our photographer and DJ were excellent. The company was easy to work with and schedule any appointments and exceeded all of our wants and needs. The booking process was simple and both vendors and Complete contacts were very responsive and friendly. Our photographer Heather was amazing, she genuinely loved her job and made the whole day incredibly easy on us. The DJ Stephen catered to our requests and was great with flow and getting the crowd involved. I would highly recommend both for any future weddings. Heather was absolutely incredible
