Absolutely Unforgettable Experience at New Waverly Manor Our experience at New Waverly Manor was nothing short of magical. From the very beginning, the New Waverly Manor team was incredibly accommodating, attentive, and genuinely cared about making our time there special. They went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly, and their warmth and professionalism truly set them apart. The property itself is stunning — the views are absolutely breathtaking and made every moment feel like we were in a dream. What truly made the experience unforgettable, though, was the time we spent with our family, especially those who traveled in from out of town. The Manor home created the perfect environment for everyone to connect, relax, and celebrate together. Evenings were filled with laughter and memories we will cherish forever — from intense games of pool and poker, to unforgettable karaoke nights, and simple family games that brought everyone together in the coziest way. It wasn’t just a venue… it felt like home. If you’re looking for a place that offers beauty, comfort, incredible hospitality, and an atmosphere where lifelong memories are made, New Waverly Manor is it. We cannot recommend them enough and are beyond grateful for such an amazing experience. 💖

I highly recommend this venue. Not only is it cost efficient, but it is a beautiful venue both inside and outside. The staff is amazing. There’s so many perks to booking with them. I also attended so many of their taste testing, where you get to go to the venue and taste the food various foods from the menu and also interact with some of their other vendors, whether it be hair and makeup photography Dj Services, linen and lighting, they made sure everyone was available. Oh, and they also let you taste test the bar options as well. When I did book with the venue we had multiple calls starting 3 to 4 months before my actual wedding date. Most of the time those calls would take an hour to complete and they never rushed me off the phone and made sure to answer every question I had. They also are very accommodating and worked with me with customizing the packages to my liking. My coordinator was Megan and she was a blessing! She made sure the day of ran smoothly. She had gave me her personal cell number so I could hit her up at any time of the day with any questions, concerns, or thoughts leading up to the wedding. I completely trusted her on the day of my wedding and didn’t have to think about anything. I highly recommend her.

We’ve really enjoyed working with Sydney so far in our wedding planning process! She’s been super helpful, always quick to respond to our questions, and keeps us in the loop with what to expect for each meeting. Before every meeting, she sends helpful info so we feel prepared, and afterwards, she follows up with next steps and important reminders. We’re so thankful for her guidance and can’t wait to see everything come together on our big day!

I could not wait to leave this review because Briscoe Manor and the staff here truly made the difference in making sure my wedding was perfect! The venue is absolutely beautiful and picking this manor was the best decision I could have made for my wedding. I want to begin with how organized, friendly and professional the staff here are. Anna, Phoebe and Kelsey are heaven sent. They made sure every request and need was met. The food that the chef produced is still being talked about as the best wedding food my guest have ever experienced. Day of the wedding Anna was right there to make sure everything flowed to perfection. The venue is spacious, and the vendors they use are top of the line from the wait staff to the bartenders. Please look no further and book with them if you want your day perfect and stress free!

My wedding photographer recommended Hotel Icon for our wedding block hotel. My fiancé and I toured here and could quickly see why. Not only are the staff so friendly, but also from the lobby to the guest rooms to my suite room everything is beautifully detailed. They surprised my husband and I with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries the night after the wedding. We loved staying here and will stay here for any hometown getaways.

We didn't originally want a hotel as our wedding venue, but once we saw The Sam and met with Michelle Scrimger, we were sold! The hotel has a boutique feel, and the Veranda event space is unique and beautiful. Michelle was fantastic to work with, and answered so many questions we had. Coordination with our on-site vendors was seamless, and their food and beverage options were top-notch. They worked with us to tweak a couple of things on the food and drink menus, and the day of ran extremely smoothly. Our package included the honeymoon suite adjacent to the Veranda event space, and it was perfect. We highly recommend The Sam Houston Hotel for a unique "hotel" wedding space.

##  Find Gorgeous Wedding Venues in Houston 

You know what they say; everything's bigger in Texas. Houston is no exception. The city is so large it could hold New York City, Boston, and San Francisco at the same time! So if you're not absolutely set on a wedding venue, Houston has a huge variety of wedding locations to consider. 

##  Popular Houston Wedding Venues & Prices 

If you and your fiancé(e) are looking for a ceremony venue and/or a reception venue that will wow your guests, Houston has plenty. The most popular wedding venues in Houston are ballrooms and hotels. If you want that classic wedding feel, a hotel or ballroom would be the perfect wedding venue. 

If classic isn't the word you'd use to describe your wedding tastes, don't worry, Houston has some wedding venues that are incredibly unique. For the history lovers, get married in an authentic pioneer town. Not quite your style? The aquarium and various museums also double as wedding venues if you want something outside the box. Houston's extensive park systems could also serve as the perfect outdoor wedding venue. Just make sure you can hold a wedding in the park of your choice and that you have all the proper documents and permits for your big day. 

While the phrase may be that everything's bigger in Texas, the average wedding price is on the low side. The average amount is about $32,614, which is only about $3,000 above the national average. Don't worry if you're wedding budget isn't exactly the same as the average. It's only an average and every wedding budget is different. 

##  Travel & Hotels 

When travelling into Houston, there are two airports that your out-of-town wedding guests will likely use. The first is the William P. Hobby Airport, which only hosts domestic flights. The drive, from the Hobby airport to wedding locations in the center of the city, will take between 18 and 30 minutes depending on traffic. This airport will likely be best for guests if your wedding venue is in southern Houston or near Pasadena. If your wedding ceremony location is near northern Houston or The Woodlands, the George Bush Intercontinental Airport is a better choice for guests. That drive is between 24 and 40 minutes depending on traffic. If any guests are driving to your wedding venue, Route 45 cuts through the city from north to south. 

When wedding guests arrive, they need a place to stay. If your wedding venue isn't a hotel, it likely won't have the room to accommodate everyone. A single night at a hotel in Houston comes in around $126, but if you're looking to find a wedding block, this is a great [wedding hotel block](https://hotelblocks.weddingwire.com "Wedding Hotel Block") service to use. Representatives will help find the best rates for hotels close to your wedding venue. 

##  Weather Considerations 

Houston has a warm, humid, temperate climate with yearly temperatures ranging from around 45 degrees to 99 degrees. The warm season in Houston lasts from late May to early September. While outdoor wedding venues are always gorgeous, Houston's summers are scorchers with daily average temperatures around 91 degrees. If you and your fiancé(e) are hosting your wedding at an outdoor venue, make sure your guests have space to escape the heat and stay hydrated. Misting tents are great for cooling off and parasols make fantastic wedding favors. Pro tip: the hottest days are going to be experienced in August, so it might be a good idea to consider both indoor and outdoor wedding venues for your summer wedding in Houston. 

If you're planning a winter wedding, the "cold" season (if you can even call it that) lasts from late November to the end of February with temperature around or below 67 degrees. Your Houston wedding might not be a winter wonderland, but it might get cold enough for a jacket, so check the weather ahead of time and tell guests to dress accordingly if there is any outdoor area at your wedding location. 

When you're ready to start your wedding venue search in Houston, WeddingWire has everything you need.
