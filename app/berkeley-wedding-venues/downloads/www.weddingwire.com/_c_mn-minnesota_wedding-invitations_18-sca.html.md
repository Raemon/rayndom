I worked with Maggie and Liz to create custom invitations and the coolest matching menu cards. We had a desert wedding in Arizona (based in Minnesota) and I could not find anything online to meet my needs so I knew I needed a custom creation. Yes, it does cost more, but it’s absolutely worth it. I received so many compliments on the invitations and it really set the stage for our out of town event. The wait staff also loved our menu cards which was helpful for a multiple course seated dinner (color coded with choice of entree). Responsive and such a fun process- it may have been one of my favorite projects for the wedding. I will absolutely use them again! I added my own wax stamps to the menu cards that I found on Etsy, but the team can also do this for you if you’d like!

We used this vendor for our Save the Dates and invitations and they both turned out amazing! I absolutely love the luxe satin paper. We uploaded a custom-made Save the Date and a custom-made Boarding Pass for one of the detail cards for the invitations (we’re doing a destination wedding), and they did a beautiful job with both of them. We have gotten so many complements! They responded the next day with the proofs, and for the invitations, we had to go back and forth a few times to get it to fit correctly, and they responded very quickly every time. I called in a few times with questions and received very friendly and helpful customer service. I would definitely recommend them for your wedding stationary!

Dan and his wife are pros at what they do! They know the invitation business inside and out! They have a ton of options, they are incredibly helpful, and work hard and get things done in a very timely matter! I am so happy with the way my wedding invitations turned out! Highly recommend!

Megan from Mae Mae Paperie was great to work with. Her creations are amazing and I got many complements on my invites that they were so unique! She did a great job.

**4.5/5 Stars** Sarah’s work is gorgeous! I saw a photo of her Minnesota themed invitation set on my Day Of Coordinator’s Instagram and knew I HAD to work with her because of this set. We worked together tirelessly to perfect my stationary set and she was so attentive to my feedback and details for my entire suite. Our stationary set included: Invitations Suite (invitation + envelope with guest and return address printing, MN-die cut details card, reply card + envelope), menus, programs, place cards, hotel welcome bag gift tags + double-sided inserts, stickers for our favor boxes and thank you cards + envelopes with guest and return address printing. Each printed item had a cohesive look and feel from the text font and color to the floral garland; we received SO many compliments on our stationary set, especially the Minnesota shaped details card! While we had a set of small printing errors, Sarah was transparent and solutions-oriented, and worked to quickly get those fixed and reprinted. While her work is pricier than just making invitations on Minted, the attention to detail and custom aspects were so worth it!
