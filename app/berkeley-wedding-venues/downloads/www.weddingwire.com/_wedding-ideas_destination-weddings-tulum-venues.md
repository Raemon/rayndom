There’s Mexico—and then there is Tulum. For couples who appreciate the finer avenues of life, this coastline town on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula is breathtaking. [Destination weddings in Tulum](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/mx-mexico/eastern-mexico/wedding-venues/MXEAST-11-rca.html) are characterized by a dreamy mix of historical ruins, culture touches and some of the best beaches in the country. Especially if you’re part of a twosome who wants to make their wedding celebration a Mexican vacation for their guests, there are plenty of options in the surrounding area that make it easy to fill their days. From exploring the ruins of the ancient Mayan port city, complete with the renowned El Castillo on a rocky cliff, to the Parque Nacional Tulum where they can dive into cenotes, adventures are everywhere. If having one of those destination weddings in Tulum is high on your consideration list, here is everything you need to know as you plan, as well as the top Tulum wedding venues.

## Best Time Of Year to Get Married in Tulum

Sure, it’s lucky to have a rain shower on your wedding day, but if you’d prefer to avoid it, skip June, September and October, as they host the most rain. For privacy and a low-key vibe for your destination wedding in Tulum, don’t book your wedding from January through March, when crowds are at their peak. The best time is right after hurricane season, October through December.
