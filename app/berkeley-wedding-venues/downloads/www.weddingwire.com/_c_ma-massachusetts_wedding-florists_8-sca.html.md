There aren’t enough words to describe how beautiful the flowers that Lavender & Moss provided for my daughter’s bridal shower! To say that they were spectacular would be an understatement. This was a very large undertaking, with that being said, I never for a second doubted that they could create exactly what I had envisioned. I had complete confidence in Megg and Tracy from start to finish! They handled everything with such professionalism and expert detail, while also providing me with unique ideas to bring my event to the next level. Megg and Tracy have surrounded themselves with a team of hardworking, dedicated and like minded individuals who carried out their designs perfectly and who were truly a pleasure to work with. Megg and Tracy became my trusted advisors not only for the florals but for my overall design esthetic. They were always available to help me with decisions as, at times, they knew my vision better than I did. I quickly realized they would exceed my expectations, which isn’t an easy task, as well as becoming two very special friends. This is my second event working with Lavender & Moss and I am looking forward to planning my next event with them.

My experience with Forget Me Not Florist was absolutely wonderful. Rebecca was incredibly kind, calm, communicative, and professional. The floral arrangements were stunning, and the pricing was very reasonable. I’d happily work with her again!

I contacted Petals about arrangements for a wedding rehearsal dinner. The somewhat vague idea I had for a Victorian Garden Party theme was turned it into an absolutely lovely and elegant table. I was carefully asked about colors, flower choices and candle options. I was extremely pleased!

Jen was an amazing florist for our wedding! I received so many compliments from our guests on the flowers. She was incredibly responsive to all of my questions and made the entire process easy and stress-free. Our wedding was in July, and she truly understood the vision I was looking for and brought it to life beautifully. I would highly recommend Jen to anyone planning a wedding!

I highly recommend Nature's Design! We got married on 9/22 in Boston and absolutely loved our wedding flowers (and received a TON of compliments from guests). Elizabeth and Lauren were great to work with and easy to communicate with during the entire process. I met with Lauren for a mock up floral a few months before the wedding and she helped create my dream floral arrangements. I found their pricing very reasonable and would highly recommend them!

We appreciated the florist so much and being so responsive to our needs. Anything we asked, she had an answer. The colors matched what we had and it became one of the most beautiful weddings we’ve been to ( I know it’s our wedding lol). But we appreciate the attention to detail and if there was any last minute changes, she was able to accommodate us with no problems. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking to have a beautiful elegant wedding

Just Bloom'd was AMAZING. They did the florals for my 9/12/25 wedding at the Beauport and the flowers were even more beautiful than I could've imagined. Everything was executed perfectly, and they provided valuable guidance and input throughout the process. They were also great to communicate with and very kind. I highly recommend Just Bloom'd!!

Annette was easy to work with and she listened and found flowers that worked with the season and color scheme. I was very happy with the cake which we threw at her last minute; it looked beautiful. The delivery and installation was very smooth. The price was fair. I would definitely recommend her!

We found Lavender through our venue’s Vendor List, and we had so much fun working with Lisa on our wedding flowers! She was game to try every idea we brought to her (we had a Lord of the Rings inspired wedding) and her enthusiasm made us that much more excited to see our vision come to life. Lisa is thoughtful, creative, and patient, and was willing to schedule a few meetings with us until our flower proposal was perfect. On our wedding day, Lisa and her team surpassed expectations for their time and effort -- everything from the personal flowers and the sweetheart table to the greenhouse and dessert table was absolutely stunning and exactly what we wanted. We and our guests were blown away!! In addition, reducing waste from our wedding day was very important to us; Lavender picked up our leftover wedding flowers and delivered them to schools and care facilities in the area. Thank you for everything, Lisa!!! Photo credit: Joseph Gonzalez-Dufresne

Danielson was our florist for our June wedding and the bouquets, boutonnieres and decorative arrangements were stunning. Judy was wonderful to work with. My flowers were even more beautiful than I could have ever imagined. They were such a perfect component of our day! Looking forward to seeing them preserved so we can cherish them forever.
