## About

**More than a DJ—this is master-level Emcee work.  
With over 25 years of experience, your DJ becomes the steady voice, calm leader, and behind-the-scenes showrunner who keeps your entire wedding flowing seamlessly. Every moment is guided with intention, clarity, and care—never left to chance.**

I bring more than music to your day—I bring leadership, timing, and the ability to calmly guide every transition, announcement, and key moment so your celebration unfolds exactly as it should.

From the ceremony to the final dance, I serve as the event’s anchor—coordinating with vendors, keeping the timeline on track, and reading the room in real time. Couples often describe me as the dynamic professional running the show behind the scenes, making sure nothing feels rushed, awkward, or uncertain. My goal is simple: you stay present and enjoy your day, knowing everything is handled.

Music is never generic or pre-decided. I work closely with every couple to choose exactly what they want to hear—from must-play songs to do-not-play lists—so the soundtrack reflects your taste, your energy, and your vision. The result is a collaborative, client-first experience designed to feel personal, polished, and completely stress-free.

**Services Offered**  
Magic Entertainment offers impeccable entertainment service at affordable prices. The wedding DJ's services include:

  * Consultation
  * Do-not-play list
  * Liability insurance
  * MC
  * One event per day
  * Audio equipment
  * Lights
  * Photo booth
  * Microphones
  * Sound/PA system
  * Uplighting
  * Prints
  * Props

Best DJ you’ll ever meet! 

Terry was so helpful, our guest loved the music and his personality. He was very thorough on our two week call and very nice! The playlist turned out amazing, he was great at keeping us on schedule and kept the guest entertained. We are so happy with how it turned out, our guest are still talking about how much fun they had! Thanks Terry!

Wedding experience

Magic Entertainment was phenomenal!!! We were able to get a package price by getting the photo booth, dance floor lights, ceremony, and DJ experience. Terry was very professional and took the time to meet with us before signing to answer any of our question and also was available through email with any and all questions. Terry took the time to meet with us right before the wedding to go over the last minute details, the ceremony, and first dance songs. He then sent us the overall wedding day plan to confirm before the big day.

Terry Rules

Terry knocked it out of the park as a DJ, MC, and doing AV for our wedding ceremony. He kept the dancefloor packed and moving with the right crowd pleasers, but also made sure to weave in some really special songs for us the bride and groom too. He was super responsive leading up to the wedding and made sure to work closely with us on our vision for the wedding. Would highly recommend.

Would hire them again!

Terry's ability to entertain and also direct people helped our wedding be fun and run smoothly. He worked well with all the vendors and coordinator. He incorporated our music selection very well. He was also very flexible to change.   
  
Also, the personnel working the photo booth was amazing and very friendly. Made taking the pictures twice as fun.   
  
We will definitely recommend Magic Entertainment.

Great Wedding Experience 

Working with Terry was amazing. Thank you Magic Entertainment for creating a fun evening on our special day. From the planning process, to song selections and creating a timeline of the wedding, Terry was very hands on and communicated effectively. Thank you! -Alejandra and Nick.

Super Fun DJ/MC!

We used DJ Terry for audio at our ceremony and DJ/MC at our reception.  
  
DJ Terry was great to work with! Super responsive, experienced, and on top of everything. It was easy to give him all of the input that he needed to do a great job. He did a great job MCing our reception, and made the night flow easily. He did a great job DJing the reception as well. Played great music, and really responded to what the crowd was liking. Super fun party!  
  
His AI powered Photo Booth might have been the hit of the night too! Everyone had a ton of fun with it and we heard from lots of our guests who really loved it. Best Photo Booth we've ever seen.

Put the Magic in our Reception!!

We used Magic Entertainment for our Ceremony, Reception and added the light production and Photobooth. Everything was fantastic!! Terry is an expert MC and is outstanding at reading the crowd and creating energy at just the right moments! I highly recommend his light production products. The venue we selected did not allow for the "fog" service much to my dismay, but the light production was amazing! The pictures we have are magical! Terry goes the extra mile with the video display to add the wow factor to the DJ booth. The photo booth was also a HUGE hit with our guests! My only regret was having to choose between the dance floor and the photo booth! I cannot say enough positive things about Terry's services. He is extremely patient and follows up with you, especially when he knows you are a swamped bride trying to keep your personal life and party planning life afloat! He knows all the right questions to ask to make sure you've got every moment covered including a "cake cutting song"! Who knew I needed that!? DJ services were reasonably priced and worth every dollar!!

Our DJ (Terry) nailed it! Ceremony AND Reception!

Our initial contact with Magic Entertainment was a bit late for our Wedding Day so Terry stepped up and walked us through the process while helping us secure our date as well. Our conference call made us feel very at ease hearing his experience just in the voice alone. The day of, he saved it a few times! Including last minute song changes! His experience made light of our mis-steps, and it was AMAZING! Our friends did not stop asking about our "Cool MC" that kept my Great Aunt dancing and my young Niece on the dance floor as well! It made our hearts so happy that we had him on our side and will not hesitate to recommend him for any event, ever!!

Greatest decision of my life going with them!

From the very beginning Terry was extremely helpful, I was a little nervous using a DJ I had never met before but am SO GLAD we went with Terry! From the planning to the big day he was helpful, professional and so kind. Our big day was so special because of the hard work from magic entertainment. Terry was a easy going, EXTREMELY funny and sweet guy and fit in with our group seamlessly. His wife was also so fun at the photobooth! It really shows that he goes above and beyond for his clients and takes the time to make sure that nothing goes wrong on the big day, which we all know CAN happen. If you are debating between this and any other DJ/Photobooth PICK THIS ONE!!!

Magic Entertainment

We worked with Magic Entertainment for our DJ at our wedding. Getting a DJ was a more last minute decision for us, and working with Terry made things so easy! He was accommodating and helped us figure out what was best for us. We only needed a DJ for the reception so we were able to figure out the timeline with Terry’s help. Our DJ was Andy Bently and he was so great! We met with him prior to go over important songs and entrances. Day of Andy was timely and very helpful with everything! He played music throughout the reception and then afterwards for dancing. Andy was so fun and played music from a playlist I provided as well as his own choices based on the mood. He also had colorful lights set up which we and our guests loved. Overall, working with Andy and Magic Entertainment was amazing and we highly recommend them!

I'm not sure if there is a single vendor who can "make or break" your event.... except the DJ/entertainment. Magic Entertainment is THE best in the area and ALWAYS gets rave reviews from happy customers and their guests. Terry's personality is the perfect balance of party and business (serious enough to feel like he's got control of the crowd and will keep your event moving along, yet SUPER FUN!!!) Look no further!
