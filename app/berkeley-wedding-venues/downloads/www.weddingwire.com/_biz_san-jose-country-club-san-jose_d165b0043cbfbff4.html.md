Best Day Ever

San Jose Country Club was the perfect spot for our wedding reception! It is a beautiful area located in the foothills of San Jose. Jackie was the event coordinator and she went above and beyond to help make our day perfect! She provided a list of their top vendors and we utilized that list. Everything from the table linens, room arrangement, and flowers were prefect. The staff was very friendly and professional. The food was AMAZING. My husband and I still receive compliments on how great the food was. Jackie even arranged to take my husband out at sunset to the top of the golf course and take beautiful sunset photos over looking the valley. The day was a dream come true.

We decided to use San Jose Country club for our wedding venue after visiting many places in Bay area. Jacqueline, the director is a very sweet lady, she is very patient, helpful and responsive. She helped me with vendor selections, including floweriest, DJ and Photo booth. Their food is so delicious, especially the coconut pawn, steak and the Mahi Mahi. Jacqueline also took us after the ceremony to various places in the golf courses to take pictures. She is incredible. The whole crew worked professional and efficiently. Many of our guests feel this is one of the best weddings they have ever been to and praise the venue. We had a great wedding there. Thanks to Jacqueline and everyone in San Jose Country Club! Definitely recommend to everyone!

Our wedding day at San Jose Country Club was such an amazing day. Everything turned out looking great, food was good, guests were happy. Initially, we were drawn to the great service from Jacquelyn Chac, the big dance floor, and the opportunity to have a seamless transition from a beautiful outdoor ceremony to the indoor cocktail hour to the reception. The day ended up better than we could have imagined. Both Jacquelyn and Lauren made it happen for us -- just super consultative, responsive, and helpful with everything from food to décor to vendor suggestions. So thankful for them throughout all the months leading up to the wedding day, especially for their patience as we kept changing our minds on food and décor. We were tight on our budget, and it was amazing to have seasoned professionals helping us along our DIY path.   
  
As for the space itself, we had the whole space to ourselves, with a room for the photo booth, a room for the buffet station right by the bar, and a huge reception area with a big dance floor. The ceremony space faces a beautiful 400 year old oak and there's plenty of room for guest seating. Worth every penny to book this venue for both the space and the service we got.

I had my wedding reception at the San Jose Country Club, and I have to say that it was the perfect choice for me. We were helped by the country club director Jacqueline Chac. She went over all the packages and what the country club had to offer in great detail. She was very helpful during the entire process and it was great that they had coordinators to make sure everything went as planned. The pricing was great compared to a lot of the venues we had looked at. What made me choose this location was the fact that we not only get to have the main ballroom for the reception, but we also get the entire first level of the main hall which includes the front entrance foyer and bar. The food provided for the venue was great, and the entire staff was very helpful and accommodating. We had great feedback from our family and guests, and everyone enjoyed the location. Not only was the main hall exceptional we also had the great serene of the golf course and we able to take some wedding photos out on the course as well. Overall, I have to say that we definitely enjoyed having our wedding at the San Jose Country Club, my wife and I highly recommend it to anyone planning a wedding or it would be great for any type of event. Make sure you book this location early in advance if you decide, you won’t be disappointed.

We loved having our wedding at the San Jose Country Club! The whole event went extremely smoothly, and much of this we attribute to the well-trained and professional staff there. The grounds and the reception hall are absolutely beautiful – they are spacious, elegant, and well set-up for weddings.   
  
We had Lauren as our event coordinator, and she was extremely organized and helpful at every step of the way. She helped walk us through the process and educated us on what other couples do in areas we were unfamiliar with. She also provided invaluable support on the day or and in the days leading up which we are extremely grateful for. Ricky on the Food and Beveridge side was also incredibly helpful, both during the planning and on the day of. Overall, the staff was incredibly helpful and I would absolutely recommend the venue to others looking in the area!

Having our reception at the San Jose Country Club was a wonderful success. It is a spacious venue with a nice decor and scenery. Working with Jacquelyn, the wedding coordinator, was easy and she was always so helpful. We had appetizers and a played lunch, which were all delicious too. The best part was being able to go out onto the golf course and taking pictures.

We originally booked our wedding a year and a half in advance (2018), but then changed our wedding to this year (2017) with only 3 months to plan. With that being said, Jacquelyn the venue’s coordinator was absolutely wonderful in guiding and helping us through the planning process. We had many questions and changes to our wedding plans but Jacquelyn remained patient, understanding, and accomodating to our needs. She had even reached out to various vendors to help us find the perfect fit for our wedding and budget. Having a tight budget made it difficult to plan a dream wedding, but the San Jose Country Club made everything possible for much less compared to other venues. Our package was very inclusive and little work had to be done from our end which really helped relieve our wedding stress! Our wedding day was absolutely beautiful! Our favorite part of the wedding was when they drove us up to the 4th tee in a golf cart for photos and videos during sunset! The view of the city and the sunset was breathtaking! Our guests really enjoyed the food and open bar. Everyone complimented well on the appetizers (coconut prawns, sliders, and cheese/fruit platter) and the dinner service (steak, chicken stuffed parmasean, penne pasta, scalloped potatoes). Many of our guests loved how spacious the venue was, which included a banquet reception room, the bar and buffet room, and a large lounge room where we placed our photobooth and kids area in. Our guests had plenty of room to dance too (dance floor was huge!). Overall, our coordinators (Jacquelyn and Lauren) were present on the day of wedding and orchestrated a beautiful and smooth wedding. Book them, you won’t regret it!
