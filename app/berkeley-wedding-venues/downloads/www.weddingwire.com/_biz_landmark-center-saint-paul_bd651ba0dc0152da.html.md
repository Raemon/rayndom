Gorgeous!!!!!

The Landmark Center was the most perfect setting for our ceremony and reception. It is incredibly beautiful, the staff is organized, professional, and easy to work with, and our guests were impressed with the beauty of the building. We used courtrooms for our get ready rooms and they were perfect for elegant family photos. The turn over time from ceremony to reception was flawless while we had cocktail hour on the 2nd floor. Honestly, we barely needed any decorations because the setting is just so wonderful. It couldn't have been a more perfect venue. The value is amazing. The whole night was simply magical. We highly recommend The Landmark Center!!!!

A Dream Come True

This venue was everything we wanted and more for our wedding day! We utilized a courtroom for our event and it was so worth it. You won’t find a more affordable, historical venue that comes close to this one. The whole building is peaceful but there’s a great energy and elegance to it. Additionally, the staff are extremely helpful, professional, and responsive. I would recommend to anyone.

Fairytale Dreams!

My Husband and I chose the Landmark Center because of their wow factor the second you walk in. The 5 store views from the atrium are truly spectacular and adds in a touch of unparalleled class to your wedding day. We worked with Betsy and Hilary the onsite coordinators and they were truly amazing and unbelievably professional. -Marisa

The Landmark Center really was my dream venue - I can't imagine our wedding having been anywhere else! The building is stunning - as the little girls at my wedding kept telling me, "just like a castle!" - and needs little decorating to look absolutely incredible. Betsy was lovely to work with when creating a timeline and table plan, and Pam was great to work with for the liquor coordination. The bridal suite is stunning and works perfectly for getting ready (although the groom no longer gets a nice room to get ready in, which was disappointing to my husband). There are also just so many pretty places to take pictures - your photographers will have a field day!

I absolutely love the Landmark Center! Not only is it beautiful, but the staff is so easy to work with and very professional. Our guests complimented the venue all night. The only thing that I wish was different about the location is that parking around the area can sometimes be tricky for a large event.

Landmark Center has been quick to reply when we've had questions or concerns. The venue itself it simply beautiful and steepd in history which my fiance and I both love. We are planning a small wedding so the Chief Justice room will be a perfect spot for us and our family/friends. The Landmark center has a variety of caterers to choose from who all have great reviews on thai and other sites. The Center is the exclusive vendor for alcohol sales but they have been very flexible about beverage minimums considering our group is under 50 people. The gorgeous building coupled with lovely Rice Park across the street is a perfect place for a wedding/reception.

I loved having our wedding at the Landmark Center! The cortile is beautiful and needs minimal decoration. The brides' room and grooms' rooms are gorgeous. Betsy and the event team make wedding planning a breeze, especially in terms of set-up and tear-down.

We absolutely loved the Landmark Center! Besty and Jenny were absolutely wonderful to work with. Both returned our calls/emails right away. The venue is absolutely GORGEOUS and we got so many compliments. It doesn't require a huge amount of decorating since it is already stunning.

WOW!!!!!!! What can I say?? The Landmark Center is a GORGEOUS wedding reception space. The Architecture and Ambiance are unsurpassed in the Twin Cities. Unfortunately many of the "Grand Dames" of public ballrooms, hotels etc have met with the wrecking ball years ago. We are SO fortunate to have this beautiful piece of History in our midst. The fabulous food and catering staff of The Saint Paul Hotel puts the "icing on the cake" NOTE: This venue books out 1-2years in advance...MOVE FAST if you want to secure it!
