I loved working with the ladies at The Queen Bee. They were so friendly and helpful throughout the process of selection invitations, wording, fonts, etc. The invitations weren't quite the level of quality I expected for the price (they were a little too thin and flimsy), but I don't blame that on The Queen Bee. I still plan on shopping with them if for my personalized stationary needs or for just a unique gift.

I am still getting compliments on my invitations a month after the wedding. Gina knows so much about the business and her craft and had a lot of ideas about how to tie in elements of the wedding and decorations to the look of the invite. She has a traditional feel, but still had some more modern options to choose from. There were probably about 5 or 6 books to look through...full of beautiful and unique invitations. She runs the business out of her house, so I was comfortable sitting and looking through the invites with her. No pushy sales people. From this one vendor, we got our Save-the-Dates, Invitations, hand-written tags for favors, Programs for the ceremony (which they made into fans for an outside wedding), GuestBook, Photo Albums and Groom's gifts. She offers discounts on everything, so it made sense just to get it all there instead of pay more to do things online. We got the groomsmen engraved beer steins and the LOVED them! She also does calligraphy and it turned out SO beautiful. She did the pages in my guestbook as well... so eveything coordinates and looks pretty and professional.

My invitations were so beautiful! I told Tracy that I wanted something unique to fit my Mardi Gras themed wedding. She was so excited and willing to work with me to create something different, yet elegant all while keeping my budget in mind. They turned out great. She created several possibilities for me to choose from and was able to get them to me in a short amount of time so that I could send them out on time. I would absolutely recommend say it on paper for people wanting something unique and custom for their wedding.

Andi and team did invitations and all paper accompaniments for both of our daughters weddings. They provide wonderful consulting and ideas based on the vision of the bride and groom. I have also used them for party invitations and they are unmatched! I wouldn’t go anywhere else! Five star service!
