Keith was the perfect officiant for our wedding. From the beginning, he made the entire process simple and stress-free, guiding us with confidence and warmth. On our wedding day, he led the ceremony with ease, making it feel personal, meaningful, and unforgettable. Our guests loved how smooth everything was, and we’re so grateful we chose him to be a part of our special day.” — Amanda & Joshua Lee

We needed to find an officiant and were down to the wire when I stumbled upon Rick. He was able to fit us in his schedule last minute (which I was extremely thankful for). He was on time, friendly and personable with everyone, and did a great job. I would highly recommend!

Amazing! I felt instantly comfortable with Eileen! We had an easy-going, laid back wedding in a spot where I felt closest with all of my family. Eileen led us through the process and was VERY accommodating and patient! Her comic delivery was right on cue and had my husband and I in tears laughing so hard! She listens, gives light advice, is respectful, yet fits in with the group. I only wish she was available to join us after the ceremony for dinner. Thank you again for making May 20, 2025 one of the most amazing days of my life!

We hired Liz remotely as the officiant for my daughter's beach destination wedding. Hiring an officiant we wouldn't meet in person until the day of rehearsal was difficult - we worried that it would be impersonal having an essential stranger responsible for officiating such an important event. Liz was extremely personable and very communicative. She kept in touch with us throughout the entire engagement so that when we finally met in person on the day of rehearsal, if felt like we had no each other forever. Her enthusiasm made it clear that she was personally invested in the couple she was marrying. The ceremony itself was beautiful, personal and everything we hoped for!

I've had the pleasure of seeing Theme Las Vegas Weddings in action for years now. Brian is an incredible coordinator. He's professional, charming, and listens to the couples needs and desires. Charity is a talented performer who moves people with her beautiful ceremonies and powerful voice. Additionally, they hand select the products and services from the community to ensure a quality experience for each couple. From backyard weddings to large-scale Star Wars themed ceremonies, Theme Las Vegas Weddings will always be my first recommendation!

My previous officiant, felt uncomfortable performing the knot tying tradition, therefore, she referred me to Ms. Glenda. She was such a breath of fresh air; with her enthusiasm, positivity and willingness to make our day perfect. Her gentle spirit resonated throughout all she did. She was so gracious and accommodating. I'm so grateful that she was gifted to us in the final hour, because she brought a magical touch to our fairytale. Highly recommend hands down!!! Would not choose anyone else. That girl married us!!!

Janine was wonderful to work with. She was professional and took the time to talk me through everything right before the ceremony so I felt completely prepared. She was punctual and made the whole experience smooth and stress-free. I would absolutely recommend her to anyone looking for an amazing officiant.
