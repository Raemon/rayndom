I am so happy to have chosen this as my venue. I had the ceremony and reception at this location and everything was perfect. Excellent service from everyone and the food was top tier. I opted for the personal preference package with the top tier bar and it was the hit of the night. The suite that the hotel reserved for our wedding night was absolutely breath taking. Thank you Hyatt!!!

My husband and I toured many venues before we landed on the JW Marriott Miami. We knew as soon as we finished the tour that this was the place for us. They were incredibly accommodating, friendly, and eager to do what they could to make sure we had the best day of our lives. It felt like everything we asked, they found a way to make it happen - we even got to pick the suite we wanted for the weekend and were welcomed with a bottle of champagne when we arrived. Not to mention, the hotel itself is gorgeous! Our wedding was originally supposed to take place in May 2020, but due to the pandemic, we had to postpone which was no easy feat. Our contact Abner was with us every step of the way - right down to making sure we had our favorite cocktails and some snacks before our reception started! If we had to do it all over, we'd choose the JW Marriott Miami time and time again.

No other venue even comes close to the beauty and elegance of the National Hotel. Ivette, the Director of Sales & Marketing, was a dream to work with!! She made planning from Chicago a breeze and did not let any detail go untouched. From my very first meeting with Ivette all the way through to our post-wedding party, we were treated like royalty. We were greeted in our bridal suite with a fresh fruit bowl, chocolate covered strawberries, variety of pastries, and a bottle of our (my) favorite wine! Anytime we needed something or had a last minute request, Ivette made it happen! Our every want and need was addressed and taken care of seamlessly and professionally. The staff, servers, and bartenders at the National Hotel knew every last detail of the event; all guests were made to feel important throughout their stay and during our event. We also reserved a room block for our guests, which was a great addition! We had our ceremony and reception at the gorgeous Aqua Pool; the pre-existing decor and ambiance of the National Hotel is something you truly cannot find anywhere else in Miami! We also hosted our post-wedding party at the cabanas by the pool; it was a gorgeous ending to such an unforgettable and dreamy wedding day! Our guests absolutely LOVED the menu we hand-selected; the National Hotel has so many fabulous options, and such a wide variety, to choose from. We were able to customize all of the food and beverage menus for our entire wedding weekend; from getting ready with our wedding party all the way through to our late night snacks station on our wedding night. We were able to taste and select from a wide variety of delicious hors d'oeuvres for our cocktail hour, and construct an amazing dinner menu for our guests. Ivette also worked with us to create a signature cocktail and to personalize our wine selections. Ivette knew how important the little details were to me, so before our ceremony we walked through and admired all of the beautiful work that all of the vendors did to bring our vision to life! I cannot imagine my wedding day any other way. If you are looking for the most PERFECT venue to host your wedding, we highly recommend the National Hotel!! 10 out of 5 stars! XO Becca & Tyler

In the search for the perfect venue my fiancé and I looked at over 26 possible locations from Homestead all the way up to Boca Ratón. Once we saw the Colonnade we searched no further. It’s an amazingly beautiful, historic, elegant, and well-located venue with the most unbelievable staff. Every single encounter we had from the valet to the servers, to the event coordinators were all exceptional. Their level of service and care to ensure a perfect event is executed was noteworthy even by our guests who commented that they had never received such good table service at a wedding before. The front desk and concierge was incredibly helpful and accommodating, going above and beyond at every encounter. The food was delicious and the quality of the wine and champagne was excellent. Although not a low-budget venue, every penny spent was well worth the money as the wedding was beyond anything we hoped for or imagined.

We had a great pleasure working with Jesse planning our son's wedding at Loews. From start to finish Jesse demonstrated superior professionalism and attention to the smallest details. She was always available and responsive in a timely manner for advice, question, request. Being a destination wedding planned in a short period of time, Jesse played a major role in the success of our wedding!
