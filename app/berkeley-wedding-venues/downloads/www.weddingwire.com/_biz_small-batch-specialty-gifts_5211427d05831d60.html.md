One of a kind wedding favors!

Small Batch Specialty Gifts was great to work with on final finishing touches for my wedding day! Shannon and Ann provided a wide selection of unique goods to choose from for my guest’s welcome gifts. We worked together in designing a custom map and selection of North Carolina themed goods, I was also able to personally supply a few more items that they were happy to add to the gift box (see attached). Along with gift curation, clients can opt to have Small Batch team assemble and deliver the gifts to hotels etc. This was a huge plus, especially being out of state, as I did not have to worry about this step leading up to the weekend and in turn spend more time with my family/friends. Thank you, Small Batch, for the perfect “special something” my guests truly enjoyed!

Small Batch is the best! 

Small Batch is amazing! We loved having a wedding registry here! The store is filled with unique decorations, awesome items for your kitchen and beautiful dinnerware. Having sweet staff is the cherry on top!

Printed Materials for my Daughter’s Wedding

Small Batch did an amazing job with the menu cards, service bulletins, and welcome map of our lovely town for my daughter’s wedding. They also worked with my daughter in creating a special save the date card. They were professional, responsive, creative, and very fun to work with. I would use them again and recommend them to all my friends.
