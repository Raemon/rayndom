5.0 out of 5 rating

HH helped manage our son's June wedding. It was an unusual situation, as sadly the bride's mother had passed and so I was left as MOG to be much more involved (by bride's request) than typical. The couple also had particular special needs to accommodate and some mixing of different religious traditions to manage. Into this tricky situation stepped HH. They did a phenomenal job, watching the budget, finding vendors with just the right personalities to fit the couple's needs and personalities along with the right skill sets, and hitting all the perfect notes for the day, down to how to honor the bride's mother without adding any sadness to such a joyous occasion. Not only was the couple thrilled with the results, but numerous guests commented it was one of the best - if not the best - weddings they had ever attended! HH exceeded expectations and navigated many difficult competing needs to boot! They're the only planner I'd ever use in MS!

My #SmallSensation turned out to be a PERFECT sensation thanks to the Perfection Wedding Company! I truly appreciate how calm, professional, and caring Andrea, Kendria, Erin and the entire Perfection family was to this Covid bride. Covid thought it put a damper on things but these ladies didn’t miss one beat. I’m forever grateful and booking the Perfection Wedding company to decorate my wedding was one of my best investments on 06.20.2020. Much love, blessings, and prosperity to you guy’s business and families -Keyeira Small ❤️

When I came to Terrica I wasn’t quite sure if anyone would be able to see my vision of a Disney fairytale wedding, but Terrica got it right away. She was so kind and easy to talk to. She was always available for questions and never minded answering the million of them that I had. She is so organized and on top of everything. Every single last detail was thought of. My wedding was magical and the day was stress free thanks to Terrica and her team. I would recommend her to anyone any time. Thanks again Terrica! You made my happily ever after come true.

Where do I begin describing how vital Kendall Poole’s team was to have by my side. It was such a relief to have their guidance, timely organization, and effortless coordination of every small and big detail that comes with planning and executing a wedding! Not only did they swiftly transition my wedding ceremony from indoors to outdoors 40 minutes before walking down the aisle, they also retrieved a new dress for the grooms mother whose zipper decided to break 3 hours before the wedding. To say the least, I would have been at a lost if it wasn’t for Kendall Poole and her team who conquered and divided, successfully achieving my wishes and visions of my dream wedding and even more!
