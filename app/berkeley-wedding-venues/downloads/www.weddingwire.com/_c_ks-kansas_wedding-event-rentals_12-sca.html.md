From the Chocolate Fountain, we rented an arch and two drink dispensers. We went to the showroom and the staff were friendly and helpful (we never felt pressured to rent anything nor were we offered any products we hadn't previously expressed interest in). The prices were incredibly affordable, as was the minimal delivery, set-up, and pick-up fees. The rented items were set up in our venue prior to our arrival. If we had to plan our wedding again, we would definitely have rented more from them! Overall, great value!

I had a fantastic experience with 'All About You Event Planning & Rentals' for my wedding! Tara was incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. She took the time to discuss my needs over the phone, helped me figure out the best table/linen setup for my venue, and even outsourced additional linens to ensure I had everything I needed. She patiently answered all my questions about table sizes and linen options. Plus, pickup and drop-off were a breeze! Highly recommend!

Phil ended up being such a great addition to our wedding! We found him because he was the most reasonable DJ in terms of time he would spend making our wedding what we wanted. He had a rather long questionnaire about the music and wedding, but it ended up making us think about everything we needed to for the ceremony, which helped a lot. Come wedding day, he was instrumental in making sure the wedding itself went off without a hitch, and he was great with the music the rest of the night!

I highly recommend Weddings by Cornerstone! The whole team made my daughter’s wedding absolutely beautiful! Debbie is very detail oriented and never settles for anything but perfection. The ceremony and reception venue both were breathtaking! Although accommodating a large number of guests may be challenging, Debbie went above and beyond. From the layout to the centerpieces for the tables to the stage and backdrop for the wedding party to lights and draping the entire ceiling and walls to the custom chandelier above the dance floor, it was all absolutely stunning!!

We used Ray's for our wedding. They whole team were very professional and genuinely caring. The tent (20x40) looked amazing and the string lights made the evening perfect. They even called the Monday after to congratulate us and to say he was worried about the rain. They worked around our schedules and made everything as convenient and comfortable as possible. I will be using the again.
