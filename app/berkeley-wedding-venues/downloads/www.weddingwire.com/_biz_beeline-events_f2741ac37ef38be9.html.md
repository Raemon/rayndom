In San Diego, California, Beeline Events offers a wedding rental collection that is built for people who want their special day to look expensive and to create a buzz. Think peacock chairs that beg for a group selfie or mixed-height lounge setups that actually make guests mingle. Couples and their loved ones will delight in the mid-century heirloom pieces that photograph like they’re from a magazine, and that restored 1950s vintage trailer that flexes as a bar, backdrop, or whatever your mood board is missing.

**Services Offered**

Everything at Beeline Events is curated, camera-ready, and delivered like they care about your story content, because they do. No damaged stock, no last-minute swaps, no “it looked better online” excuses. Rent the vibe. Return the furniture. Keep the flex. From San Diego to Las Vegas, basic is not accepted.
