We had our wedding here and also rented the cabins for the entire weekend, and it was absolutely perfect! From start to finish, everything exceeded our expectations. The venue itself is beautiful, the cabins were so convenient for our bridal party, and the entire experience was seamless. The staff was truly amazing and went above and beyond to help in every possible way. They were kind, attentive, and made sure our wedding day was not only stress-free but incredibly special and memorable. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate such an important moment in our lives. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a stunning venue with outstanding support!

I don't even know where to began with this review. First off, this venue is absolutely stunning and by far was the best all around venue in Columbus. The staff exceeded my expectations and truly made our wedding day everything we dreamed it would be. Alexa, our coordinator, was amazing and very detail oriented. She was able to answer all of my questions in a timely manner and work with us on our budget and help us with everything we wanted for our wedding day. Nicole was also amazing to work with and very helpful and detailed. The staff treats you like family and was able to help us with anything we needed on wedding day and allow everything to flow smoothly. Our guests all commented on how beautiful our venue was. Sure, it is a little pricey but in the end it was truly worth it for us as we couldn't imagine having our wedding anywhere else. I highly recommend this venue. Be sure to reach out and book early!

I don't have enough words to describe how wonderful it was to have our son's wedding at Meadow Ridge. We were all traveling from out of state and the staff at Meadow Ridge made this incrediby important day easy and magical! I have been a wedding coordinator for over 20 years and I know how hard it easy to make a wedding day look effortless but they nailed it. The attention to the details is unsurpassed. From the little touches in the Airbnb to literally setting everything up for you the day of the wedding, they go above and beyond expectations. I can't recommend them enough. Our day was more special than I could have hoped for and the thanks goes to Meadow Ridge.

We chose Canopy Creek for our May 2025 wedding and it was truly a treat! The property is stunning with a ton of options for ceremony spots. The team is very communicative and I felt that they genuinely cared about our experience. Megan was super sweet when we met her and gave us all the details. The day of, Doug was there to help answer questions, and even spoke on behalf of me and my husband to vendors. Our day of coordinator, Jordan was hands down the best day of coordinator we could ask for. They were very flexible with vendor options, in fact the most flexible out of all venues we toured. We highly recommend working with Canopy Creek for your wedding or large event!

I walked in on our wedding day and it literally took my breath away, it was so beautiful. The Old Blue Rooster and their team were incredible and handled everything we needed — we didn’t have to think about or manage any of it on our big day, we just got to enjoy! And our guests loved it. From the initial tour to booking to communicating all the details to the big day, everything was TOO easy…we expected it all to be so much more work & stress — it wasn’t! We can’t recommend OBR enough!

Such a beautiful setting for a wedding. I loved everything about this place. The owners are very responsive and accommodating. Sue, the wedding coordinator, is my hero. She worked so hard throughout my daughter’s wedding. I can’t even list all the things she took care of. She ensured everything happened how and when it was supposed to and continued to check on me throughout the day. I know this isn’t on her job description, but she was also an amazing therapist. 😂 She went out of her way to make sure everyone had what they needed and that they were happy. I could not have pulled this wedding off without her. She moved nonstop cleaning, moving things, helping people…the list is endless. I would highly recommend Little Brook Meadows!
