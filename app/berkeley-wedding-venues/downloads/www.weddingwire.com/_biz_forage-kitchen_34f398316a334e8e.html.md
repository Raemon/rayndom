Forage is fabulous!

We held a private party for about 65 guests. The space was perfect. The service was perfect. I highly recommend Forage for a private event. They are very accommodating and customize the experience for your group and size. Very very happy with our experience at Forage.

Self Catered Wedding

My wife and I held our self-catered wedding dinner here, so this review is for Forage Kitchen as a venue and as a commercial kitchen.  
  
You know when you rent a venue and all the venue wants to do is to do the bare minimum, nickle and dime you, and generally not care about the success of the event? Well, Forage Kitchen, especially Iso, is the exact opposite.  
  
The space itself is unique and functions well. We converted the parking lot into the dining and partying area, and while not picture perfect, it's open yet private - with a rustic yet industrial feel.  
  
Since Forage Kitchen's kitchen itself operates as a commercial kitchen for rent during the day, it's extremely easy to use, with both equipment and the infrastructure available on premise. All we had to do was bring in food, serving rentals and staff, and everything else we needed was right there.  
  
As mentioned above, during the prep, the event itself, and through the clean-up, Iso was responsive and flexible, playing an important part in the success of the event. I can't understate how valuable this was to us.  
  
All in all, you can't go wrong with this venue/kitchen. Highly recommended.

Forage Kitchen is a highly recommended location for your next party or gathering.

I held a birthday party at the beautiful Forage Kitchen a few years back. The cafe area is small, but with the tall ceilings, and double doors leading to the outdoor space, it feels much larger and inviting. Matt and Iso are terrific hosts, so accommodating and personable. They were welcoming to all of my guests and many in attendance commented to me about their professionalism and warmth. I highly recommend Forage Kitchen for your next venue/ party!
