We had our wedding reception at hanzas. It was the absolute best! Janet made sure there was anything & everything we could possibly want or need. The location itself is beautiful. We couldn't have asked for anything more. Being able to just walk across the lawn from the party barn to the beautiful house couldn't have been any better. ❤️

Esperanza Ranch is a beautiful venue! From the moment you drive onto the property you recognize that you are at a special place! The staff is a pleasure to work with and very accommodating. Anytime I had a question or needed something they were knowledgeable and helpful. They work hard to make your special day one to remember!!!

We absolutely loved our wedding day & rehearsal dinner at Back In The Pines. Gorgeous, professional, and so helpful with vendors, food, decor. Anything we needed! Absolutely love this venue— and will be using it for other events as well.

There are not enough words to convey how amazing this venue is and how delightful the owners are to work with! The grounds are beautiful and impeccably maintained; the owners are the most welcoming and genuinely sincere people I have ever met. They went so far beyond my expectations in assisting us through our son’s wedding, covering every detail…there are not enough synonyms for AMAZING!!! We will 100% use this venue for any future events!

My husband and I got married at The Legacy at MK Ranch in August. The whole entire team is amazing and made our experience with finding a venue better than we could have imagined! And, to mention— it’s STUNNING! We are so deeply grateful we went with The Legacy as our wedding venue. That day was perfection and The Legacy was one of the leading reasons why.

Nathan and Haylie are very kind and very chill. Weddings can be very stressful and they were always willing to help and created a stress-free environment. The venue is absolutely beautiful and a fair price compared to the outrageous prices you would pay for venues in OKC. Would highly recommend Silver Barn Farms.

I have sooo many good things to say about the Rustic Rose Barn! Stephanie was so amazing and so on point with every bit of my wedding day! I am so happy that we decided to choose them as our vendor! They had that southern charm that we have missed so much after moving and it made the experience that much better! Stephanie, her husband, and staff were so helpful and literally decorated and laid everything out for us! They made our entire day so memorable and enjoyable by taking a lot of the stress off of us! I would give 10 stars if I could! They truly went above and beyond for us and it is so greatly appreciated! Our family could not stop talking about how amazing they were! Thank y’all so, so much for such an absolutely amazing day!!
