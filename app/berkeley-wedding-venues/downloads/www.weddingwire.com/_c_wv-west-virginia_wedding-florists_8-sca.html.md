We are so thankful for the creative design of Blossoms and Buds. We had a destination wedding at Snowshoe, West Virginia… in the winter. Needless to say, I was concerned about what flowers to use and how they would hold up in the cold weather. Well, I am so thrilled with the beautiful bouquets and arrangements we received. After sending a few inspiration pictures I found on Pinterest, I was told that she knew exactly what I had in mind. She was right. The process, from start to finish, was painless and I could not have asked for more.

We had first ordered flowers through another florist who had a family emergency to contend with and so we were left with 4 days till the wedding with no florist. My friend knows the owner of H & F and they really came through for us and helped us get the flowers we needed.

Steve & Jerry at Winter Floral are amazing. The effort and pristine vision for design was evident in their work completed for my wedding at the Clay Center. Their vision for any event is unparalleled. They are able to work with budgets, and can design a look that will meet your budget and your vision. Steve is beyond skilled and knowledgeable, and his work is stunning. He was very responsive during the process, and willing to meet the needs and creative vision of his customers. The flowers were beyond my expectations and he is so genuine, that after setting up the flowers, he returned to his shop to get one additional detail that he knew would make the look complete! I would highly recommend using Winter Floral for your next event, especially if it’s a wedding!

Mrs. Patti is so sweet. Evergreen was recommended by Calvary UMC (the church we used). They turned out to be wonderful! They knew the church and the rules of the church and so were very helpful in knowing what was needed and how much. She took our ideas, which were probably more specific than with most people, and ran with it. The flowers were beautiful. They also recommended the wedding cake vendor, Mrs. Mary Stanley, that we used which A+ photography had recommended. Mrs. Patti took care of the cake topper and coordinated their arrival with Mrs. Mary's to make sure the cake looked perfect and that flowers were placed just right on it. I'd definitely recommend Evergreen for every occasion!

The lady who does the wedding flowers (at least for me) was SO sweet! I really enjoyed working with her. I gave her some pictures from Pinterest and she sat down and worked with me to get flowers and whatnot picked out. She called me to confirm a few weeks prior to the wedding, which was so helpful since I had planned to call her. She made my bouquet and the corsages for the mothers/grandmothers. Highly recommended, good prices comparatively. Bridal bouquet: $130ish Corsages: $25ish each? (hard to remember this stuff)

Tammy was very helpful in transforming photos I brought in into real life floral arrangements. She sat with us and listened to our vision and explain what she could obtain for the season and have us many options. She made bouquets, centerpieces, wreaths and more! We also rented linens here. My guests were very impressed with the results!

I can't thank Matt at Spurlock's flowers enough for making my daughter's wedding a beautiful one. He was wonderful to work with and helped me all along the way. The room lite up when he started placing all the shades of purple in the Foundation Hall. I recommend Spurlock's flowers and Matt for any occasion or event.
