Denisha and her husband were very helpful and amazing with making my visions come to life for my wedding. Denisha is very Good at details and was always there when I had a question about something. They were amazing at coordinating not just my vendors but everything else in between from my wedding party to setting up the venue for me. I highly recommend using them for your wedding planning needs, especially if you were getting married in the Tallahassee area. They know most of the vendors in Tallahassee already and work with them very well.

Bud and Mary's Marina in Islamorada exceeded our expectations as a catering company, providing an unparalleled setting for a dream wedding. We have catered two weddings here in the last three months. From the moment we set foot on the property, we were enchanted by the breathtaking views and location that set the stage for an unforgettable event. The marina's picturesque backdrop and crystal-clear turquoise waters provided an atmosphere that elevated the wedding experience. The expansive event hangar allows for versatile setups, accommodating a range of guest counts and styles. The flexible options for ceremony locations, whether a sunset beach affair or an elegant elevated deck overlooking all the boats, showcase Bud and Mary's adaptability to various wedding visions. As a catering company, we at Miami Grill Catering appreciate venues that consider the needs of vendors, and Bud and Mary's Marina excelled in this regard. Bud and Mary's Marina stands out as a wedding venue in Islamorada. Its natural beauty and facilities create a harmonious environment that contributes to the success of any event. We are proud to have been a part of weddings hosted at this exceptional venue and eagerly look forward to future collaborations. Without a doubt, we wholeheartedly award Bud and Mary's Marina five well-deserved stars.

Words cannot explain how absolutely happy we’re for choosing The Garden at Bella Sera for our wedding day. From the moments we did our tour of the venue we knew this was the place for us and no other will ever compare. Everything was such an amazing stress free process from the moment we booked to the day of our event. I decided to do majority of the planning myself and received amazing help along the way with details needed to know for finalizing our ceremony and reception. Every single staff member there and every single detail was absolutely perfect! The provide catering and you cannot for wrong their food is absolutely delicious the chefs are amazing our guest talked about how great the dinner was and the crawfish beignets were hands down a hit people just couldn’t quit taking about them! Dinner was also a breeze for the groom and I as we spent the days having so many to do but didn’t have to worry about a thing when it came to feeding ourselves because your meal is set on your table for you ensuring that you get to enjoy your meal. Like I said we literally couldn’t have asked for more even pack up and cleaning to go was super easy right after our sparklers send off which was absolutely beautiful. IF you’re looking for the perfect venue and staff to go along with it look no further Bella Sera Gardens is everything and more made all of this 7months pregnant bride dreams come true I am so grateful and thankful to have chosen here to forever have the most beautiful memories of our special day. Thank you Bella Sera!

We chose Mermaid Beach Weddings for the vow renewal ceremony celebrating my in-laws’ 50th wedding anniversary, and we couldn’t have made a better choice. As Italians arriving in Miami only a few days before the ceremony, we completely relied on them for everything: the location, the decorations, and the photographer. From the very first contact, we always received quick and clear responses, and they were consistently helpful and available to answer all our questions. On the day of the ceremony, everything was simply perfect—actually, it exceeded all our expectations. The location was beautiful, the decorations were elegant and thoughtfully arranged, and the photographer who worked with us was extremely kind and professional, making everyone feel comfortable. The photos turned out absolutely wonderful and, as an added bonus, they were delivered two weeks earlier than expected. An impeccable service from start to finish, which allowed us to enjoy such a special moment with complete peace of mind. We truly recommend them to anyone looking to organize a beach ceremony in Miami without any stress. Highly recommended!

Our wedding at Celebration Gardens was truly unforgettable. From the very beginning, Brian’s responsiveness and willingness to accommodate every detail went above and beyond anything we expected. In the final weeks leading up to the ceremony, Giselle stepped in with such grace and organization, making the process feel seamless. On the day of, the attendants did a wonderful job supporting us and our guests. Everyone was amazed by how stunning the venue was—and many couldn’t believe this hidden oasis sits right in the heart of Winter Park. We’re so grateful for the entire team who helped make our day so special.

I am so glad we chose FOY to be our wedding venue -our day was ABSOLUTELY perfect. From the start Ali and her team were incredibly helpful, we found almost all of our vendors from their recommendations and we honestly had the DREAM TEAM. I should add though you don’t have to choose from there preffered list -you have a lot of freedom for any vendors you want to use with no additional fees (….which I know is not the case for all venues -so I was grateful). Did I mention they are pup friendly? Our girl Mochi hung with us all day which was just so special. Our guests loved the champagne welcome with the historical greeters (we were able to hire via the FOY).They also were able to enjoy the exhibits and of course getting to hang with/ feed the peacocks before the ceremony. We had 140 guests and we all comfortably fit in the magnolia room for our plated dinner service, we had the dance floor right outside on the patio and the ceremony itself was at the waterfront. We were also able to book the bridal cottage which fit myself, my 7 bridesmaids, 3 moms, and our 2 hair and 2 makeup vendors perfectly with more than enough room. The full fridge and full bathroom was super handy too- especially being able to run and use that restroom throughout the night (trust me a private restroom is handy when you have a giant wedding dress lol) This may also seem silly to add but I also loved that there was a ton of parking available for our guests and vendors- St Aug is a hard city to find parking in and all the other venues we viewed didn’t have any free parking options. We can’t recommend the FOY enough! (I don’t have all my wedding photos back yet but here’s a mix of iPhone and a few sneak peaks from my photographer)

Tides is a beautiful location. The coordinator is very casual and can sometimes be difficult to get ahold of, but he is there and on top of everything when it counts. I will say their recommended vendor list is not the best, but the venue itself has great food, sound system, and a view!
