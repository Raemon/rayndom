French Country Manor was the perfect setting for our wedding day. The outdoor space is absolutely beautiful — elegant, scenic, and exactly what we envisioned for our celebration. Even when we were hit with torrential rain, everything still felt seamless and magical. The tented setup ended up being perfect and honestly added to the charm of the day. Getting ready on-site was such a great experience and made the entire day feel relaxed and special. The space was comfortable, picturesque, and ideal for photos and those quiet moments before the celebration began. Although our reception was held at a different location, French Country Manor set the tone for the day in the best way possible and was the perfect location for our ceremony.

We recently hosted our wedding at Riverdale Manor, and I cannot say enough wonderful things about our experience. From start to finish, everything was truly exceptional. The food was outstanding, the service was impeccable, and the ambiance was absolutely magical. Maureen and her incredible team executed every moment with flawless precision. From the rehearsal the day before, to the ceremony, to the reception, and even the pack-up and send-off at the end of the night—everything flowed seamlessly. Their professionalism, organization, and genuine care allowed us to be fully present and enjoy every moment of such a special day. Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone at Riverdale Manor for giving our family and our guests a truly memorable event

We just had a conventional yet unconventional wedding at Normandy and were thrilled with all aspects of this venue. The staff, food, responsiveness, friendliness, professionalism and value were all exceptional! I highly recommend their “soup to nuts” approach to letting Normandy Farm be your one-stop venue!

My husband and I had an overall wonderful experience having our wedding at Armstrong Farms. All of the staff is friendly and helpful, and they will work with you to bring your dreams to life! It is definitely important to have a vision and clear plan for decorating/execution of details in your day. The coordinator helps with the flow of the day and providing scheduling/venue-specific directions, but it is up to you to be well-planned and delegate tasks to your helpers! (These roles were explained well ahead of time, so this was not a surprise.) We had our rehearsal dinner on-site and utilized the on-site lodging (cottages) for our wedding party and ourselves throughout the weekend. It is so convenient and fun to be able to stay at the venue for several days as we prepared and spent quality time in anticipation and later celebration with our family and friends. Many members of our wedding party frequently mentioned how special it was to spend the night before our wedding all making memories and getting excited together in one big "sleepover" of sorts. The accommodations were quite cozy. It was wonderful to wake up exactly where we needed to be and to also be able to have our ceremony and reception at the same site (cuts transportation costs and also makes it easier for older friends and family for whom mobility and transportation independence is a challenge). The staff at Armstrong were flexible in allowing us to have our ceremony down by the water even on a day when the ground was soggy after rain. We were determined to highlight this beautiful natural aspect of the venue that we had so fallen in love with, and they went to every effort to make our wishes come true, even when it was challenging. (They even allowed us to roll out artificial turf as an aisle to make walking in the wet grass easier!) I recognize that at many places, we would have been told "no" to having our ceremony down by the water with ground conditions like that, and I am so so grateful that they ran with our hopes! The owner, Andy, and coordinators Davlin and Nicole were on-site all day to answer questions and assist us as needed. Andy's expertise in years of venue direction is obvious in conversation and his leadership, and he was a very reassuring presence throughout the day. They communicated efficiently, kindly, and expertly with our vendors to answer any questions and make sure everyone was where they needed to be. Beautiful space with scenic outdoors for photos. We had our wedding on 5/18/24, and we can't wait to get the photos back! We enjoyed the farm atmosphere with animals and wildlife nearby, but definitely make sure you are accepting of that! (We even had a snapping turtle nearby during morning set-up!) It added to the fun of the day. Armstrong Farms helped make our dreams a reality, and all our guest could not stop commenting on the beauty and "rustic elegance" of the venue. Ample space for eating, socializing, and dancing in the barn/tent throughout the reception as well. Best day of our lives!

If you’re looking for a wedding venue that blends historic charm, breathtaking gardens, and a team that will make your day feel truly magical, the Pearl S. Buck Estate is everything you could hope for and more. I had always dreamed of a garden party wedding where the natural beauty of the setting could shine on its own, and the estate delivered just that. I got married at the Pearl. S. Buck Estate on July 11, 2025, and it was truly the best day of my life. From the very first tour to the pack up at the end of the night, Rachel Bova was an absolute dream to work with. She is incredibly organized, responsive, and attentive—always one step ahead with answers to every question throughout the planning process. On the wedding day itself, Rachel ensured every detail was perfect: the timeline ran seamlessly, our vision was executed just as we imagined, our guests felt cared for, and she kept me and my husband fully present and stress-free. Because of her, I was able to completely relax and live in the moment, something I had hoped for but didn’t know was truly possible. The food was another highlight. From the signature cocktails and delicious hors d’oeuvres to beautifully plated entrees and desserts, everything exceeded expectations. Jamie Hollander’s catering team went above and beyond—not only was the food fantastic, but the servers were warm, attentive, and genuinely fun! Several of our guests even made a point to tell us afterward how wonderful the staff was. The estate itself is nothing short of stunning. The gardens and grounds are immaculately maintained in every season, and each time I visited during the planning process, I was struck by its beauty—even on rainy days. On our wedding day, the lush flowers and greenery were on full display, and with endless picturesque spots around the property, we have the most gorgeous variety of photos to remember it by. There is truly not a single negative thing I could say about this venue or team. Choosing Pearl S. Buck Estate was the best decision we made, and if you decide to celebrate your wedding here, I am confident you’ll experience the same magic we did.

Our wedding day at Carmen’s Country Inn & Gardens was nothing short of magical, and we owe so much of that to Cathy and her incredible team. What began as a slightly stressful morning—with unexpected rain and a shuttle bus breaking down—quickly transformed into the most beautiful, lush “secret garden” celebration we could have dreamed of. Cathy remained calm, reassuring, and unbelievably accommodating throughout the day, handling every hiccup (as she so sweetly called them) with grace and professionalism. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, but the experience is made extraordinary by the people. The food was delicious, the service was impeccable, and every member of the staff was warm, friendly, and eager to help. Our guests couldn’t stop raving about everything—from the atmosphere to the hospitality—and we truly felt cared for from beginning to end. Cathy’s pricing is fair, the experience is exceptional, and her commitment to making your day perfect shines through in every detail. I wholeheartedly love this venue and genuinely cannot recommend it enough. It turned our worrying start into a dream day we will cherish forever!

Ruth and her employees did an amazing job on my wedding day! They set everything up and even gave me suggestions on where to put all the decorations I brought! They cleaned up everything as well.

I can’t say enough about this amazing venue! My daughter‘s wedding was at La Massaria six days ago and we can’t stop raving about it! Gorgeous, beautifully taken care of, every little detail managed. On the day of the wedding, we had to do absolutely nothing! The amazing staff were so attentive and efficient and cared for us like family! We were able to bring in some of our own embellishments and at the end of the night they packed them up for us so we could continue the celebration without worrying. Flowers by Scott, which came with the package were magnificent! The food was delectable! Our ceremony was brought inside due to rain and it was so spectacular in the barn with the gorgeous stone walls and wood beams and lighting! We can’t say enough the people were so kind and gracious and caring. I’m hoping my other daughter will get married here as well! Book them!

We cannot say enough good things about Lingrow Farm as a wedding venue. From start to finish, they truly went above and beyond to make our entire wedding weekend completely worry-free. The team met with us multiple times leading up to the wedding to walk through expectations, details, and timelines, which made us feel so prepared and supported. Having weekend accommodations on-site was such a gift—it allowed us to fully relax and soak in every moment without feeling rushed or scattered. One of the most meaningful parts for us was that they ensured our dogs could be part of our wedding day, which meant the world to us. The property itself is stunning. The pond with a boat created the most beautiful photo opportunities, and our guests couldn’t stop talking about it. We also loved that Lingrow Farm welcomed personal touches like a coffee cart and a bonfire during the reception, which made the night feel extra cozy and memorable. If you’re looking for a venue that is not only beautiful but also genuinely cares about you and your experience, Lingrow Farm is truly something special. 🤍

The Glasbern Inn is a beautiful location whether you’re looking for a place to stay or an event to host. We were married and had our rehearsal dinner and reception all on site a couple of weeks ago. The ceremony spots/reception hall/dining options/rooms are all concentrated into a tight pocket. Not only is the space maximized, each area still feels like its own and has the added bonus of close proximity to wherever you need to go next. We can attest that Fall is a great time to have your big day at the Glasbern, the foliage provides a beautiful backdrop for ceremonies and pictures. We started the process in June of last year and Megan was extremely helpful with keeping us on track and organized. Everyone we interacted with over our wedding weekend (Bartenders, Servers, Receptionists, Bridal Attendants, etc.,) showed us so much kindness and patience as we worked through all of our plans. Our guests were gushing over how beautiful it was and how great the service during the reception was all night. We’re confident that anyone looking for a space, not only to get married but to spend a little extra time with your loved ones, would be happy going with The Glasbern.
