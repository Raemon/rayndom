It was an absolutely wonderful experience. The arrangements were beyond expectations! It was a very collaborative relationship with the floral designer Michelle. The colors and flower choices could not have fit into our theme and venue any better. I would highly recommend them.

Megan and her team at Project Floral are so talented! They were so great at taking the time to really understand our vision and discuss how to make that vision come to life. We received so many compliments on our floral the entire wedding. They were the most beautiful wedding flowers I've ever seen! Prior to the wedding day, Megan was super organized, responsive and professional! We couldn't imagine our day without the Project Floral team and their flowers!

Rose's work was absolutely amazing. She took my Pinterest board of inspiration, ran with it and create floral designs that were better than I could have imagined. When my bridal bouquet was dropped off, I literally looked at my soon to be husband and said "This is exactly what I wanted, it's perfect". She knew exactly what types of flowers would work well with our venue, helped with overall decor and everyone thought the flowers looked so great. Highly recommend working with Rose if your wedding is in the Vail/Beaver Creek area.

Ellen was an absolute joy to work with. She created the florals of my dreams! My vision was a classic and elegant black tie optional wedding and she went above and beyond my expectations. Ellen is also such a fun, lovely, and friendly person to work with- she truly put me at ease that she would deliver on the vision. My florals made my wedding feel like a fairytale and it was truly the best day of my life. I could not recommend Ellen enough!! Thank you Ellen!!!!

Sara was fantastic to work with! She brought our wedding floral vision to life. She is clearly very knowledgeable in her work, asking clarifying questions about my vision to get the details just right. I loved my bridal bouquet, and the boutonnieres, the arch and accompanying florals, and the votives and table decor were all stunning! She was prompt on our wedding day and easy to work with, helping get multiple locations set up. Highly recommend Sara for your wedding day florals!

Genny and everyone at Sturtz & Copeland were incredibly helpful and professional throughout the entire process. In the month leading up to our wedding, they collaborated with us to create a beautiful floral vision board, and they executed it to perfection.

I couldn't be happier with our choice to select Designs Inspired by You for our wedding party florals! I wanted simple baby's breath bouquets without the markup from a traditional florist. DIY was incredibly responsive and made everything so easy. They assembled the boutonnieres and corsages while showing us the best way to arrange our bouquets. Our "poofs" photographed beautifully and doubled as dessert table decoration. Highly recommend DIY for a fun, easy wedding floral experience!
