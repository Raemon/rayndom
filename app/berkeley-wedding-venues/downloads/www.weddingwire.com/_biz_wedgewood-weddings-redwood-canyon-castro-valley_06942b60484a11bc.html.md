Amazing venue and great service!

We are so grateful to Ana, Liv, and team for their incredible help for our wedding reception!!!! They made everything flow so smoothly and the vendors they suggested all came through as well. The day of was a breeze thanks to their coordination. The ballroom was beautiful and the food was excellent. We got the prime rib, chicken parmesan and tortellini and our guests raved about the food afterwards! If you are considering a wedding in this area and want the help of an all inclusive venue like this, Wedgewood is a great option.

Perfect Reception Thanks to the Amazing Team

We held our wedding reception at Wedgewood Weddings Redwood Canyon in Castro Valley on 08/31/2025, and we are beyond grateful to the entire team for making it such a perfect evening. Planning a reception in a short time frame (we began our first conversation with Ana, our Wedding Planner, on 07/26) could have been stressful, but the Redwood Canyon staff turned it into a smooth and enjoyable experience.  
  
From the start, Ana (Wedding Planner) and Liv (Wedding Coordinator) guided us through every detail and kept us completely at ease. On the day of, Aleece (Banquet Captain) led the flow of the event seamlessly, supported by the banquet team — Jovany, Liz, Brandon, and Alina — who provided warm, attentive service throughout the night.  
  
Steven (Head Chef) and his kitchen team truly outdid themselves — the food was brilliant, beautifully presented, and they even customized one entrée to our needs, which meant so much to us and our guests.  
  
Roberto (Bartender) kept the drinks flowing all night with the top-shelf package. His fast service, great energy, and attention to detail made a huge difference for our guests.  
  
DJ Chris was phenomenal — even though he was new to Indian music, he absolutely nailed it and kept the dance floor alive for nearly three hours straight. The décor team made the room look stunning and created a warm, inviting atmosphere. The photographer captured every moment beautifully, and the photo booth was another highlight — our guests had a blast with it and we’ll treasure those memories forever.  
  
Even behind the scenes, everyone was thoughtful. The security guard was incredibly helpful, professional, and ensured everything outside the venue went smoothly — something we didn’t think about beforehand but appreciated greatly.  
  
From start to finish, the timeline and flow of the evening were perfectly managed. Every last-minute change (including adjustments with tables) was handled with flexibility and care. We walked away with full hearts and endless gratitude.  
  
To anyone considering Redwood Canyon: not only is the venue gorgeous, but the staff are what make it truly exceptional. Thank you to Ana, Liv, Aleece, Jovany, Liz, Brandon, Alina, Steven, Roberto, DJ Chris, the décor team, photographer, and security guard — each of you made our night unforgettable.

Amazing Venue!

This venue is so great! My husband and I had such a positive experience working with this staff. Everyone was so kind, thoughtful and helpful throughout the planning process. Our day of coordinator Liv was so prepared and made our day stress-free! We also loved working with Liz, she was so sweet and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the night! Cannot recommend this venue enough!

Great all inclusive wedding package experience 

The package value is great given they include simple wedding planning. Some advantages of choosing Wedgewood are: 1) in house preferred vendors are experienced in working together. Wedgewood also streamlined the payment process for these vendors so you only pay one bill. 2) in house wedding planning services are great. Liv was great in the initial consultation which helped us understand the value of different packages. Alison did well in our first planning meeting which set up 70% of all the details. Jacoby was awesome and helped us bring the wedding to the finish line. I appreciate her day of coordination work which ensured we stayed on schedule. Banquet manager Jovany kept our needs well attended throughout the night and was so efficient with clean up. They packed all our belongings for us so we don’t need to do much. The in house photographer API Jaredd and Jade are very professional and efficient with their time. They worked well with Wedgewood planners and know all the good spots to take pictures. Overall, this is a very efficient team and value of the package is great and comparable. Our wedding went very smoothly.

Wonderful Wedding Venue!

We wholeheartedly give the Wedgewood Weddings team at Redwood Canyon a 5-star rating! We can’t thank and appreciate Megan, Allison, Liz, the chef, banquet and kitchen staff and the outside vendors enough! We were planning the wedding on a very short timeline – less than five months. So, Wedgewood, and especially our coordinator Allison, made it doable!  
  
The ceremony site was absolutely beautiful – we loved the outdoor setting and privacy of the space! And Allison and the staff were so efficient in setting up and taking down. It was just as we had asked it to be. The newly remodeled ballroom looks great! We love the new chandeliers, bar area, flooring and walls! It was great to have such flexibility in laying out how we wanted to use the space. The day of the wedding, Allison set up everything - all of our decorations, photos and signs in the lobby, the check-in table with seven different offerings, and put the menus, favors, and cameras on the guest tables.   
  
The food was amazingly delicious – a wonderful extra, rare at a large buffet! Very picky guests raved about how great everything tasted. Big shout out for the prime rib! And the chef was able to accommodate those guests who wanted rare and those who wanted well done. Liz, our Banquet Captain, oversaw the serving of the food and managed the staff for the reception. At the end of the evening, Liz and her staff packed up everything we had brought and the flowers for us, all ready to take home.  
  
Wedgewood Weddings has a very defined process which helps move the planning process along. In a few instances, we needed a little extra time on a few decisions, and they were very accommodating. We worked initially with another coordinator and often others would answer emails, etc. They were all very good. Allison, whom we met with for our third meeting, the rehearsal and wedding day, was beyond wonderful! She was so knowledgeable and resourceful! Allison’s experience and guidance was one of the best parts of the whole process. She knows what’s she’s talking about.   
  
One of the most helpful aspects of Redwood Canyon was that they have pre-vetted vendors and they were all excellent! We used one of their recommended florists – Dana’s Florist. She was awesome to work with and delivered the most beautiful flower arrangements. She listened to what we wanted and delivered. Likewise, Old Towne Danville Bakery created a stunning cake - just like the photo we shared of what we would like. They have a great way of tasting their cake and filling options too. And the cake was not just beautiful; it was absolutely delicious! The photographers from API seemed to be snapping pictures everywhere and we are eagerly awaiting the photos. (Note: If you choose to have an unplugged ceremony, just know it can take a while before you get to see photos of the ceremony!) The DJ was also very good, MC-ing the whole evening incorporating several special twists we wanted and playing the songs we had requested.  
  
All in all, Redwood Canyon was a great choice and we highly recommend them!

Magical venue, great team

We were recommended the Wedgewood venues by friends and celebrated our wedding at Redwood Canyon 1 month ago. Our wedding coordinator, Liv, as well as the whole team were incredibly friendly, helpful and patient with us, even though the timing was quite tight as we were a binational couple getting married on a K-1 visa, and did not have much time to plan ahead. We had a fairly small wedding, about 30 people, but it was simply magical. The ceremony took place with lovely weather on the outdoors part of the venue at golden hour, allowing for such a scenic moment and great photo opportunities with all of our guests. We then moved on to a reception outdoors. We had a fair amount of custom decoration ideas and these were all arranged together by the team with lovely little touches and in accordance to our wishes. We even had space to play a "first game" of pétanque and jenga which we wanted to do as opposed to a "first dance", and it's been so seamless and so much fun! Very grateful to our DJ Mike (recommended by the venue's team) as well, who worked with a long playlist full of song choices made by ourselves, and arranged it throughout the event to make it so much more "like us". It all worked seamlessly. (PS: My spouse and I got to be driven to the different areas of the venue in a golf car, which was so cute and made a great impression with guests!) The venue received a lot of praise from our loved ones as well, who were able to share this magical moment with us. We highly recommend it across the board: very friendly team, will adapt to your wishes and budget, accomodating for micro-weddings, as well as tight timelines (we planned our wedding over 5 months only). From the bottom of our hearts, thank you so much for making this such a beautiful memory for us.

A Breathtaking Venue with an Amazing Wedding Team!

My husband and I were engaged in October 2023 and began looking at wedding venues the month after. We then finalized our booking with Redwood Canyon in January 2024 to give ourselves ample time for planning and financing for our big day on May 26th, 2025. Since we live on the East Coast and majority of our families reside in the Bay Area (I was also born and raised in San Jose), we wanted to find a venue that can provide an all-inclusive package and bring our vision to reality - and Redwood Canyon checked all of those boxes... even going above and beyond. We are very happy with the entire process that led up to our special day and the outcome of our wedding.  
  
*1 year prior to the wedding*  
  
Despite our wedding being a year out, the team was very accommodating when we asked questions about the overall vibe and venue look. They kept us updated with some of the renovations they were making at the time. When we wanted to do a physical tour in June 2024, they fitted us into the schedule and showed us the actual colors of table cloths, napkins, lighting, etc.  
  
*8 months prior to the wedding*  
  
The wedding team sent us an invitation to the Fall Wedding Extravaganza Fair for late October 2024 - inviting all couples who have confirmed a booking. We unfortunately couldn't make it since we were in the East Coast, but they accommodated us by including our friend couple residing in the Bay Area to take over our place. Our friend couple FaceTimed us during the entire event to make us feel like we were there! They commented how it was nice to try out all the food options they had in the package to know what foods the couple would like to finalize for their wedding day. They also enjoyed the fun activities the DJ curated - there were two opportunities to win a prize from those activities.  
  
*5 months prior to the wedding*  
  
This was a two-hour call with the wedding team to go over our vision and details. We would recommend going over the binder they'll send in advance after you confirm booking with them. I forgot the name of the person assisting us, but she was very patient and fun to talk with! She reassured us that if there were changes we'd like to make over the next few months, they'd be happy to accommodate.  
  
A few months later, vendors contacted us to further discuss additional details - officiant, cake, DJ, and florist.  
  
*1 week prior to the wedding*  
  
We had Jacoby as our amazing wedding coordinator and Ana to assist on our special day. They reviewed and confirmed details as well as what to expect on our Rehearsal Day, which was a day prior to our wedding. We loved their positive attitudes and professionalism throughout the process!  
  
*Wedding Day*  
  
Despite how fast and chaotic it felt, we truly appreciate Jacoby and Ana for keeping us on the right pace, consistently checking in with us, and making sure we were happy and comfortable throughout the day. If there was something I, my husband, our wedding party, and family needed, they were quick to provide it. They also knew where to put our decor and took some behind-the-scenes photos to share with us after our wedding.  
  
We had our photographer, Hayden from A Perfect Impression, who suggested all the right poses, shots, angles, and places to take our photos. Our DJ, Saul, was very accommodating with a song request and some changes that we communicated through email and text - the vibe of the ceremony and reception was perfect. The food was fantastic, the photobooth provided high-quality images that we could receive through a texted link.  
  
*Overall*  
  
If we could rate it more than 5 stars, we totally would! We are truly happy that we chose Redwood Canyon for our wedding - an amazing and friendly team with a beautiful venue that accommodated 80 of our guests!

Amazing experience for our big day!

Alison has been amazing at helping us plan our wedding! We are not planners, so we had to rely on her a lot. She’s great at giving you reminders, and helping us plan for coordination with vendors. She’s very professional, and super accommodating with some of our last minute changes. I would recommend any new couples wanting a stress free wedding to go with Wedgewood!

Flawless Wedding Experience – Beautiful Venue & Amazing Team!

Redwood Canyon by Wedgewood Weddings was the best decision we made! The entire team was easy to work with, friendly, and made the planning process smooth and enjoyable. Our coordinator, Allison, was so kind and thoughtful — she made sure we had quiet moments to breathe and was always smiling. The banquet captain, Liz, was great too and kept everything running perfectly. The venue is stunning, the food was absolutely delicious, and the weather was perfect. We couldn't have asked for a better day or better team. Highly recommend!

All-Inclusive Venue with Top Notch Planning, Coordination & Services

One word: Perfect. As someone who suffers from severe anxiety, I can honestly say I have never felt more at-ease and confident than while working with the Wedgewood Weddings Redwood Canyon team -- they always had our backs, kept us on track, and made us feel taken care of. From the first venue visit, during the planning meetings, all the way until the rehearsal and wedding day, the professionalism, clear communication, planning resources, and organized approach made for a seamless experience.   
  
We worked with Allison as our Wedding Planner and Coordinator and I firmly believe that she is one of the main reasons our wedding went as incredibly as it did. Redwood Canyon, provides a planning binder as soon as you sign that includes monthly checklists ahead of the wedding to help keep you organized in between planning meetings. It is also filled with valuable information about the wedding planning process, examples, vendor questions, and general guidelines. It helped us structure the planning process without losing the ability to truly personalize our event. Every meeting we had with the planning team was concise, direct, and organized -- it helped us stay on track throughout the process and gave us the opportunity to discuss ideas and ask for advice (which they are also more than happy to give via email). Super responsive and accommodating -- we were so impressed with how easy the process was. We also partnered with their recommended Bakery, DJ, and Florist as part of our vendor team, and the coordination between venue and vendors was absolutely seamless...by the time the week of the wedding rolled around all the main aspects were locked in and we knew the event was in good hands.   
  
The wedding day itself was perfect. Allison served as our Day-Of-Coordinator, and together with Jacoby (co-coordinator), Liv (banquet captain), Liz (banquet captain), and rest of the team (cooks, servers, bartenders) we had the most incredible wedding. We arrived at the agreed-upon time on the day of the wedding, and from that moment onwards, the Redwood Canyon team took over to deliver the best experience. They were organized, calm, kept us well hydrated and fed, and kept everything on track for us all night. We were able to confidently hand off the reins -- we didn't have to think of anything all day other than having a good time and enjoying our day as much as possible, trusting that all the logistics were in good hands.  
  
Overall, the venue itself was gorgeous. We had our ceremony in the Arbor Lawn, our Reception in the Grand Ballroom (we initially chose the venue primarily because of the dance floor), and rented out the Rose Room for the Cocktail Hour. Everything was included and beautifully decorated with all our desired personal touches, the food and drinks were delicious, and the planning and coordination services must be some of the best in the business. I can't imagine a more incredible experience than what we had and am so thankful for the Redwood Canyon team's care and professionalism -- especially Allison, who we were fortunate enough to work with from first meeting through the day-of. The wedding day went off without a hitch and I couldn't recommend the Redwood Canyon team more
