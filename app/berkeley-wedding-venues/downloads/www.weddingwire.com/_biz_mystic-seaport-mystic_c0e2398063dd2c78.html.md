Mystic Seaport is a museum and ocean-inspired wedding venue in Mystic, Connecticut. It offers couples waterfront vistas dotted with grand ships as the backdrop for their big day. This seaside refuge easily enhances a wedding or related celebration, making it a memorable locale for hosting milestone moments.

**Facilities and Capacity**

Mystic Seaport was founded in 1929 in order to preserve America's quickly disappearing seafaring history. This gives the venue a historic ambience as well as making it a one-of-a-kind setting for "I dos". The museum sits on 19 acres and includes places to eat, exhibits, and areas for private events. One of these spaces is The Boat Shed at Lighthouse Point, which can accommodate up to 200 people. It is an open-air pavilion that has views of the museum and the Mystic River, providing a picturesque setting for dining and dancing. Couples looking to host an even larger gathering can choose the North Lawn, which has a capacity for 500 guests. Here, a tent can be set up for shelter and both ceremonies and receptions can be held.

**Services Offered**

Mystic Seaport provides catering services for events through its partner, Lancer Hospitality. The team has ample experience providing creative and delightful dishes and high standards of customer care. The meal can be rounded off by the team's bar packages. Other services include setup and cleanup for your convenience, as well as rentals such as tables, chairs, flatware, and more.

Perfect Venue

We made the decision to have a tiny covid year wedding in Oct 2020 after our original wedding plans were uprooted. Jenna and all of the staff at Latitude 41 were wonderful and truly made an amazing day for us. The venue was more than helpful ensuring we were able to have the type of day we were looking for. Everyone was attentive, the food amazing, and our day truly perfect thanks to everyone who made it happen at Latitude 41. I highly recommend this venue. If you choose them you will not regret it!

Gorgeous Venue and Helpful Staff

My wedding was everything I hoped for and Jenna and the rest of the staff were radiant every time something "went wrong" - I put that in quotes because if I thought something was going wrong they swooped in and then it was like nothing ever happened. It's a beautiful venue and everyone I've talked to since said this was the best food they've ever had at a wedding! Its my first wedding so I didn't know what to do and it was wonderful that Jenna could direct and bounce ideas around. She never interfered with what I was planning just helped me to see any gaps and to find solutions. This was the very best and I'm so happy I chose Latitude 41 as my venue!

Our Perfect Wedding Day!

Jenna and the team at Latitude 41 were all fantastic! From day one we knew our decision to have our wedding there was the right one. Jenna listened, heard my vision, and followed through beyond my expectations. She was very responsive, gave great suggestions, and made us feel so special. I had the best, most stress-free, wedding day because I knew I could trust Jenna! There are so many details involved in planning a wedding, and Jenna did a great job making sure everything was covered. The food was FANTASTIC -- guests are still raving about their meals. We felt like we got the chance to actually enjoy our night because of the way the team stayed on top of things and kept us in the loop. They kept us well-fed and always made sure we had a fresh drink in hand. The scenery is beyond beautiful, but the staff was the icing on the cake. Our wedding day couldn't have been more perfect!

Beautiful venue 

My daughter chose Lattitude 41 based on the rustic nature of the River Room and the Mystic River and boats in the background. Despite the brutal wind outside, the wedding ceremony and reception fulfilled every expectation. The staff adjusted to having the ceremony on the enclosed patio and cocktail hour in the River Room. All the guests raved about the appetizers and dinner. We all danced the night away. The location was perfect for sunset pictures and most importantly, the bride and groom had a wonderful time!!

September wedding 

Our reception was held at Latitude 41 next to the Mystic Seaport. It was absolutely beautiful. Our pictures by the boats and on the Seaport grounds came out beautiful. We reserved the River Room for the reception. The decor and setup was everything we envisioned thanks to our planner Jenna. She also did an amazing job keeping everything running timely and smoothly. All the staff at Latitude was very friendly and helpful!

Incredible Service

Alyson was amazing to work with. She would check-in throughout the planning process and was very helpful with making final decisions. The day of, they set up the Boat Shed exactly how I had envisioned and described. They were very attentive to detail. The food was AMAZING and there were many compliments from our guests. The wait staff and our bridal attendant, Carol, went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. We can't thank them enough!

We are so happy we decided to have our ceremony at the Greenmanville Church and our reception at Latitude 41 this past December. It was wonderful to work with Jenna throughout the planning process, and we and our guests were thrilled with the venue, food, and staff.

We held our wedding at Latitude 41 on July 7th, 2017, and it was hands-down the best day of our lives, thanks to this beautiful venue and professional staff.   
PLANNING: The planning process was seamless working with Jenna Landon who is their coordinator. During planning meetings, we sometimes came "unprepared" and she offered many helpful ideas. She responded quickly to emails, and even last minute requests. Jenna is a consummate professional. Simply put, she gets the job done. Our event was literally flawless thanks to her hard work, attentiveness, and impeccable eye for detail.  
VENUE: If you visit the venue you will see that the setting is beautiful. The North Lawn is a gorgeous stretch of green grass that they keep pristine. The morning and afternoon of our wedding saw several inches of rain, and still, the lawn was dry and ready for guests when they arrived. The River Room has a lot of character (in a good way!) and the setup (including bar, dance floor, and cocktail hour) was perfect.  
STAFF: Wonderful!  
FOOD: We had heard the food was good, and had tasted it and thought it was delicious as well, but are always skeptical of "wedding venue food." However, it did not disappoint. We thought the food was even better on the day of our wedding than when we had done a tasting. Our guests raved about their steak and salmon, and the apps (none of these were "upgrades" to the menu).   
ADVICE: Add an extra half an hour to the event (we did and it was well worth it!) and rent the North Lawn!

We had our reception here in September and it was amazing. Our event planner went above and beyond in making sure our special day was perfect. She was always reachable and responded very quickly to all our questions and emails. Everyone was extremely professional, very approachable and kind to our guests. They were able to accommodate all of our guests needs and make last minute adjustments for us. The venue was beautiful, very clean, and had an amazing of view of the water. We couldn't be happier with the way the reception turned out. Also, being a gay couple we were a little worried, but it was a non-issue with everyone we interacted with. They made us feel very comfortable and at ease, and it really enabled us to enjoy the day as any other couple would.

Simply put, they are AWESOME! Great food, but equally important, they are great communicators with your vendors so everyone is on the same page. I have had the pleasure of working with them at The Branford House and many other venues on numerous occasions.
