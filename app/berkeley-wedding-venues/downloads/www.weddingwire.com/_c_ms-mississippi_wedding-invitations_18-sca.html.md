It was a pleasure working with Invitations And....so much more. They were able to show me so many different invitations to choose from. They offered suggestions and gave advice along the way that really made my wedding planning much easier. They pointed out things that I never would of thought of. I was able to get my invitations, favors, gifts for the bridal party, wedding and reception accesories all from one person. Invitations And..so much more even did the addressing of my envelopes and mailed my invitations for me. They truely are there to make the wedding planning easier. I have already reccomended them to friends that recently got engaged and plan on getting my friends bridal shower invitations from them. I am sure that I will be using them for years to come. Their name relly sums it up perfectly.... they really are so much more!!!

I love Fresh Ink. They are so kind and easy to work with, they were incredibly responsive throughout the entire process of selecting my wedding invitations, and they even sent a sweet note after the event congratulating us on our marriage. I would use Fresh Ink again in a heartbeat!

Leslie designed my Save the Dates, and I absolutely loved them. They're exactly what I wanted. She was super helpful and made multiple proofs until the design was exactly how I wanted it. You won't be disappointed.

Oh my goodness, I don't know what I would have done without Meredith! She knows everything about wedding planning and has really listened to me so that my vision is captured on my wedding day! She also designed BEAUTIFUL invitations and programs for us, as well as a unique monogram to brand our wedding.

Christie was amazing to work with. We told her our vision of what we wanted our invitations to look like and she hand painted a bunch of different options for us to choose from. we decided last minute to add a detail card to the invitations we had already received, Christie drafted one up and sent it to print all within 24 hours. We then had to reschedule our wedding due to COVID-19 and Christie worked with us again to reprint our invitations and even changed the design a bit to make the new invitation just a little different from the first. Working with Christie is such a delight and so easy. Her work is so unique and make your invitations that much more special. I would recommend Christie and Copper Creative to anyone looking for a unique invitations with a personal touch, making them stand out from your typical invitation websites.
