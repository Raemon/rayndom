I cannot say enough wonderful things about Maui Aloha Weddings! From the very beginning, their communication was clear, thoughtful, and incredibly reassuring. They coordinated every detail of our wedding with such kindness, warmth, and professionalism that I truly felt taken care of the entire time. What impressed me most was how seamlessly they handled a major curveball just one week before our wedding, when we had to find a new photographer due to a family emergency. Maui Aloha Weddings stepped in immediately, re-coordinated everything with ease, and never once made the situation feel stressful. With them at the helm, I felt calm, supported, and confident that everything was under control. Their organization, compassion, and genuine care made our wedding experience not just smooth, but truly easy to be in the moment and authentic. If you’re looking for a team that leads with clarity, grace, and heart, Maui Aloha Weddings is it. We are so grateful for them and couldn’t have asked for a better experience!

Cherise really blew us away!! She managed to create the most beautiful micro wedding for us in under a month! Most people stress planning a wedding in over a year, and Cherise made planning a wedding in a month a relaxing and fun experience. I didn’t have to worry about a thing because I knew we were in such good hands. She was extremely responsive, kind, and helpful in every way! It really seems planning is second nature for her. You can tell Cherise is extremely passionate about her career and really deeply cares about her couples. Every review I’ve read on her also sings her praise! I would say a good wedding planner is the most valuable vendor to have on your team, and Cherise is the best one out there. I can confidently say she gave us the PERFECT Maui wedding.

We honestly can't say that anything was a better investment for our wedding than Wedding Planner 808. Janice was incredible in every way and through every step of the process. Literally anything and everything we needed, she was able to handle. Her planning is extremely thorough, thinking about things that we didn't even realize that we needed to think about, and ensuring that everything would run smoothly. Each meeting was carefully thought out, covering every detail of our wedding down to the last second. Anytime we needed anything, all we had to do was text her and she was so quick at answering with the exact answer we needed. Janice had a wonderful relationship of all the vendor's we worked with, being able to coordinate with them, and being able to recommend vendors we hadn't yet thought of and needed. Even coming down to the wire on some of our little details, Janice was great at following up to ensure everything would be taken care of. The day of, everything ran incredibly smoothly, in which we didn't have to worry about a single thing and just got to enjoy the entire day. Janice was great at talking us through everything that would happen and ensuring that we also got to do the things that we wanted to do. We couldn't be happier with our wedding and the process that got us there all thanks to Wedding Planner 808!!!!

Tori helped plan my son and daughter-in-law’s wedding, and it truly could not have been more perfect. From the venue to the ceremony and the reception that followed, every detail came together beautifully. Tori supported the bride and groom throughout the planning process, offering guidance, organization, and support while honoring their vision. She never took over, but instead helped ensure everything ran smoothly so the bride and groom could be in the moment and enjoy their day. We are grateful for her care and support in making this wedding such an amazing and memorable night.

From the moment I reached out to them a year before my April wedding, I knew I was in good hands. We chose the partial planning package, and the level of care, communication, and attention to detail we received felt above and beyond. Jayvee, Chiara, Elena, and Mina were absolutely incredible. They responded to emails promptly, walked us through every detail during planning meetings, and truly listened to what I wanted -elegant and simple. On the big day, they brought that vision to life flawlessly. I didn’t have to worry about a thing. They handled everything with calm professionalism and kindness. One moment I’ll never forget was when I realized I had forgotten my veil, and the venue was ready to start the ceremony without it. Even after I expressed that I really wanted to wait, they pushed to begin on time. I was feeling pretty heartbroken at the thought of walking down the aisle without something that felt so special to me. Jayvee stepped in and advocated for me without hesitation -she firmly and graciously pushed back multiple times, insisting that we wait. Thanks to her, we delayed the ceremony about 20 minutes until the veil arrived, and I got to walk down the aisle with my veil! I’m forever grateful for that moment. We also had a transportation issue less than a month before the wedding when the shuttle company we had originally booked suddenly bailed on us. It was a stressful moment, but Cherished stepped in immediately, found a reliable replacement, and handled all the coordination. The entire day flowed beautifully, from ceremony to reception, and I received so many compliments from our guests about how stunning and seamless everything felt. Thanks to The Cherished in Hawaii Weddings Team, I was able to be fully present and soak in every moment of the most beautiful day I could have imagined. Mahalo Cherished!

Kim was so great to work with! I planned my wedding from California, and Kim made the whole process of planning a destination wedding easy and organized. She gave a range of options and vendors for us to choose from, and since we booked early we for the most part got all our first choices that were amazing quality/delivery for fair prices. Day of the wedding she and her team were incredibly helpful and sweet, making what could be a stressful day smooth and memorable. I highly recommend Kim and her team to anyone getting Mauied:)

Working with LAuren from Your Aloha Wedding was a dream come true. I thought I could handle planning a destination wedding on an island that I knew no one. While I acomplished a lot I knew I needed help and found Lauren. She went above and beyond from setting up the marriage license appointment, dealing with contract issues with a vandor and letting me ship things to her house. She was professional, kind and thoughtful. The day of I was able to truely relax and enjoy thanks to her. Finding her and using her was one of the best decisions I could have made and she made everything perfect!

Absolutely phenomenal! Our wedding at the Olowalu Plantation House in Maui, Hawaii, was nothing short of a dream come true, and it was all thanks to the incredible team at Tropical Maui Weddings, led by Lori and her husband Jamie. From the very first consultation, Lori exuded warmth, professionalism, and a genuine passion for making our special day perfect. She took the time to understand our vision and went above and beyond to ensure every detail was meticulously planned and executed. Her expertise and local knowledge were invaluable, and they provided us with fantastic recommendations for vendors, decor, and unique touches that made our wedding truly unforgettable.

The setting was breathtaking, with stunning ocean views, lush greenery, and a charming historic house that added a touch of elegance to our celebration. They seamlessly managed everything from the setup to the flow of the event, allowing us to relax and fully enjoy our day without any worries.

Weddings of Hawaii helped plan our perfect wedding day. We were a little nervous with this being a destination wedding, but their consultants went beyond our expectations to answer questions and plan every detail. They offered suggestions for dining and other activities while in Oahu too. Our wedding day was spectacular and our minister, photographer and videographer were kind, helpful and professional. Everything about our special day exceeded our expectations. Our officiant was truly kind and his messages throughout the ceremony heartfelt and meaningful. The photos and videos captured the special moments and are cherished treasures! Thank you to the entire team!!!!!!!!!!
