The Great Gallery in the Toledo Museum of Art is a beautiful venue to have a wedding ceremony if you do not prefer to have a religious ceremony.

My husband and I decided to have a very small wedding, and we honestly couldn’t have picked a better venue. Angel treated our day with the same care and importance as a huge event. She found thoughtful little touches that made everything feel special—from the House Band jamming out to White Wedding with our son, to leading us to the coolest spots in the museum for photos. She totally got our quirky personalities and love of music and helped create a wedding we’ll never forget. If you’re thinking about it—do yourself a favor and get married at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!

As a 2020 bride, I obviously had a lot of stress and constant changes surrounding my wedding, however the Science Center was incredibly amazing at helping with everything, easing my concerns, and working with me to adjust things along the way. I was able to change my wedding date from June to September, then significantly change the guest list and plans for the day. I also never got a chance to do a tasting or see the venue again before the rehearsal, but I didn’t need to because everything was perfect. We dropped off boxes of decorations ahead of time and the staff set everything up for us, the ceremony outside on the balcony was beautiful and the guests had an absolute blast playing with things at the cocktail hour. Then the caterer worked with us to develop our own custom “Cleveland” menu which was so delicious, and both the Science Center and catering staff were so attentive to Covid restrictions and keeping guests spaced apart and safe. I would highly recommend the Science Center as a super fun wedding event space with great help all along the way!!!

We had our wedding reception at CMNH and cannot recommend it enough as a special-event space! We got so much overwhelming feedback from our guests saying it was the coolest wedding they've ever been to, and it's all thanks to the museum. The newly renovated event space is modern and gorgeous, and there was plenty of room for 200 guests, a DJ, a dancefloor, an open bar, a photo booth, welcome tables, etc. In addition, our guests absolutely LOVED being able to see all of the exhibits and eat next to a dinosaur skeleton! The special event team at CMNH is kind, responsive, and phenomenal to work with, and they made our night completely stress-free. They also gave us so many amazing, unexpected options, such as light rentals, bringing out live animals during our cocktail hour, and offering custom planetarium shows for our guests. In addition, the museum's catering company, Levy, provided absolutely delicious food options for everything from hors d'oeuvres, to dinner, to a donut dessert bar, to late-night snacks, and we and our guests were wowed by the quality of everything they ate. We cannot recommend CMNH enough, especially for future bride/grooms looking to get away from the norm and offer their guests something TRULY fun and unforgettable!

Could not have chosen a better team. I gave a theme, minimal input, and breakfast for the chefs and they had a blast. This reflected in their work. It was all anyone talked about for weeks. We wanted a fun and relaxed reception. We did a beach theme. They help coordinate so much including setting up and working with our vendors. The coordinator really kept us on track and did so much behind the scenes. The animals were fantastic. As bride and groom we were able to take private pictures with the animals too. Our friends even rented the carousel out. Everyone loved this. We choose the Water's Edge pavilion. The best for animal lovers and water. Such a great breeze off the water and the one walls of the building can open up for air. But it was also great to close in case we had rain. It was just magical. I cannot beat those pictures/view and the time we had together.

I had my wedding at The Taft Museum of Art in July 2018 and we are SO HAPPY we went with this venue. The Taft recently hired a new event manager, Alyssa, and she is WONDERFUL. Her boss, Nick, was also helpful making sure her transition into the new role went smoothly. Nick reassured me and answered every question during the transition process. Everyone answered all my questions and met with me two weeks before the big day to make sure every detail was covered. Alyssa made sure all the vendors knew what they were doing when they arrived and I didn't have to handle a thing the day of. She took care of everything after the reception had ended and my fiance and I could party alongside our guests - not worrying about where the decorations would go or what things needed to get thrown away. We were even able to pick items up the next day so nobody had to carry items to their car after the wedding ended. Alyssa texted me the morning of and found me when I arrived at the venue to see if I needed anything. At one point, I was shaking from hunger and she brought me out a whole plate of hors d'oeuvres. I just can't say enough wonderful things about the staff at the Taft. Make sure you go with the caterer at The Taft, Luke -- we got SO many compliments on the food! It was the best wedding food I've ever had

The Toledo Zoo was an awesome venue. Unique, different and fun. The Zoo's the staff and bartenders who worked the night of our wedding were so helpful and friendly. I really loved how much is included in the wedding packages offered by the Zoo (from bar service - to catering - to linens) which made it easy and breezy to plan the wedding! Gina, Faith and the events crew were all so great to work with. They were very organized and everything went wonderfully. This November we had our ceremony and reception in the Malawi Event Center which was so gorgeous! The reception area has a 70ft long aquarium in the room, which added so much charm. Between the ceremony and dinner we opted to have the carousel open for our cocktail hour, which made for great photos and lots of fun. Overall we received so many compliments how fun our wedding was, and we couldn't dare to disagree!

This was a lovely and unique venue to get married and have our reception. The ceremony was in Shark Ray Bay Theater and the reception was in the Riverside room and the aquarium. Our guests were able to walk around, explore, and even interact with the touch tanks. It was a great venue for adults and kids. Lam, the event coordinator, and her team were fantastic to work with! Lam was very easy to work with and made the planning process very smooth. Lam was quick to help us when we misplaced tablecloths and found us a solution.

We could not have chosen a better wedding venue than the CAC! Marty was an absolute joy to work with. He was extremely responsive, especially close to the wedding day, when stress levels tend to increase. He was also so much fun, and knowledgeable about both his space, as well as nearby hotels, restaurants, etc. The CAC was also surprisingly affordable, especially for such an incredible space. Our photographers were giddy with all of the creative photo opportunities the space lent itself to. Our wedding day still feels like a dream, and that's in large part due to Marty and the CAC.

We had our wedding ceremony here. We dealt with the gallery manager; he was really nice and willing to work with you to meet your needs. We had a rehearsal the night before our wedding and everything was ready for the next day. As long as you keep him informed everything should go smoothly! We were lucky to have such vibrant paintings at the time of our ceremony & it added a lot to our ceremony decor. We didn't have to decorate much! I would love to have an event here again and would suggest it to couples who want something different for their ceremony or reception!
