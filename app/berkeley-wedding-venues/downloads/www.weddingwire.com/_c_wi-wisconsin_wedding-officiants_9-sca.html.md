Working with Byron was definitely one of the easy parts of the wedding planning. Meeting with him over zoom a few times definitely helped ease our minds about the whole process. He's very easy to get along with, work with and is very fair with pricing. He takes the time to get to know you and figure out the best course of action for the ceremony and how it should go based on what the couple wants. Highly recommend!!!

Veronica was so warm and pleasant! Both her, and her husband, Mike, were wonderful. We were so fortunate to work with them! I'd fully recommend her to anyone. She's very accommodating, and has a way of treating you like her own family. ❤️

WE LOVE KIM!!!! She was fantastic from start to finish. Her communication is clear, consistent, and she’s very easy to talk to, and very good at walking us through the marriage license process as well. She tailored our ceremony script perfectly for us and our love story. She truly went above and beyond our expectations. Her outfit at the wedding was fabulous too. We’d give her 10 stars if we could! Thank you Kim!🫶🏼

We had plans for our wedding day that weren't "traditional" and Reverend Jennifer Miller did an incredible job officiating our ceremony just the way we envisioned! She curated an intimate and personalized ceremony to fit all of needs. Her words were filled with passion and captured our past, present and future as a couple perfectly. She described our love story so well it was almost as if she'd known us for a long time. Our friends and family mentioned that our ceremony was one of the most beautiful they'd ever seen. During the planning stages, Rev. Miller was responsive, insightful, and creative. She was always there when we needed help or had questions. She was very thorough when explaining the steps we needed to take before, during, and after the ceremony. We highly recommend Rev. Miller to any couple in need of an officiant!

Joan did an amazing job with our ceremony! We heard nothing but glowing compliments from family members about how wonderful the ceremony was. Joan was great to work with; she took the time to meet with us several times before the ceremony to make sure it was perfect and to prepare us for the day-of. She is very detail-oriented which helped the ceremony run smoothly and exactly the way we wanted. She is highly talented and we would recommend her to anyone.

My wife and I worked with Una to have our wedding officiated. It was wonderful. We needed some things a little bit different as we are a mixed-culture couple and Una made this incredibly easy to fit into the ceremony. We were initially looking for an officiant that was traditionally trained and after learning about Una and here church and background we knew it was a great fit. She understood exactly what we were looking for and delivered.

We are beyond grateful for Rev. Marcia and the beautiful ceremony she made for us. From the very beginning, she took the time to truly get to know us, not just as a couple but as individuals, so that every word of our ceremony felt personal, meaningful, and true to us. Her calm and organized nature during the rehearsal was so impressive, ensuring everyone was set up perfectly while keeping us relaxed and focused. On our wedding day, she brought warmth, professionalism, and a personal touch that made the entire experience unforgettable. Our guests are still talking about how amazing Marcia was! If you are looking for jan officiant who is fun, listens, cares and delivers an amazing heartfelt ceremony we cannot recommend Rev. Marcus enough! I would choose her over and over again!

Derek worked with us to make our wedding ceremony personal, beautiful and just right for us! After working with Derek throughout our wedding planning process and through our sessions in his Relationship Enhancement course, my husband and I both agree Derek feels more like a friend than just an officiant. We feel very equipped to start a healthy marriage after the tips we learned in the course, Derek is a great listener and really invests himself in the couples he works with. We felt completely at ease about our ceremony with him by our side!
