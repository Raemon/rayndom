Adrian was absolutely wonderful to work with! He was responsive, reassuring, communicative, and incredibly attentive. As a wedding day-of coordinator, I’ve worked with many DJs, and I’m particularly picky because they play such a huge role in shaping the mood, energy, and flow of the entire day. A great DJ not only asks thoughtful questions but also offers helpful tips, guides the timeline, MCs with confidence, and keeps everything moving seamlessly. Adrian did all of these things exceptionally well. He’s a true asset to any wedding vendor team!

NPA was recommended through our venue and was the first vendor we booked after the venue! Blair was so quick to answer every email I sent throughout the process. Paul was our DJ and absolutely killed it! Our ceremony mic wasn’t working day-of and he stepped in and provided help even though we hadn’t booked them for the ceremony services. For the reception, we sent a playlist with the general vibe we were going for and he perfectly curated around it and had us dancing all night! Music was the #1 biggest thing for us for the night, and so many people commented how full the dance floor was all night. We are SO happy that we went with NPA.

Paul and Perry were absolutely fantastic from start to finish. They were professional, upbeat, current with music, and incredibly responsive throughout the entire process. On the wedding day, they were the one team I knew I didn’t have to worry about at all—they handled everything seamlessly and kept the energy exactly where it needed to be. Our guests had an amazing time, and the flow of the night was perfect. I would 100% hire them again and highly recommend them to any couple looking for a stress-free, top-notch DJ experience

Michael from Expressions of Music was absolutely PIVOTAL in our wedding day!!! He cares so deeply about the bride and groom having the wedding of their dreams. He spares no detail, he was intentional, and he provided us with resources so we could be the most prepared for our day. I didn’t have to worry, Michael is an incredible professional who would do anything in his power to make sure the day goes right. He is creative, gave us ideas of how to help with the flow of the reception entrance (some of us are awkward and need help!) but without being pushy about his ideas! He helped foster the most seamless, beautiful day I could’ve ever dreamed of. Thank you Michael! 5 stars aren’t enough!

As the title says, DJ Wes was awesome! We can’t recommend him enough! From the first conversation we had with him til the last, he was nothing but a true professional. We had to postpone our original wedding date bc of some health issues and Wes didn’t blink when we told him the news. He was incredibly flexible and worked with us through that part of the process. He was also great in helping us understand exactly how much music we’d have to pick and what there would actually be time to play(trust me it’s way less than you think). We originally had his full equipment/lighting package booked, and after working another wedding at our venue a few weeks before, he told us he didn’t think we’d need all that we were about to pay for. That shows a ton of honesty and integrity on his part because it cost him a little money. He didn’t have to do that and we greatly appreciated it. As everyone knows when they’re planning a wedding, it all adds up, and every dollar counts. On the actual wedding day, he showed up right on time, was very organized with the events/schedule of the evening, honored all the songs we had picked out to play, and did a great job of keeping the dance floor going. Lastly, an added bonus of hiring Wes, is he brings his own camera and takes photos of everything throughout the night from his point of view as the DJ. We got those photos yesterday(about 9 days after ceremony so very quick) and they WERE GREAT! It was almost like having a second wedding photographer. If you need an AWESOME DJ for your wedding or any other special event, we highly recommend giving DJ WES a call bc he’ll absolutely deliver! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING WES! So glad you were part of our perfect day!

Cam with Meritage was literally the best DJ ever and I’m so thankful I trusted him! He just knew the vibe of the reception and crowd at all times and no one left the dance floor all night. The transitions from different songs/genres to the next were unreal and flowed seamlessly. He knew exactly what to play and when and had such a great mix of songs with little guidance given. What I really loved was that he went outside of the traditional practice of always playing a slow song which tends to get people off the dance floor. We skipped that and it was the best; just happy good vibes all night. We are still getting compliments about how amazing our DJ was. Cannot recommend him enough! 12/10

My wife and I hired Jake for our October 2024 wedding at the Cordelle, and we're so glad we did! Leading up to the big day, Jake was communicative and asked us all the right questions. He did an excellent job playing our requested songs, making announcements, and kept the vibe right all night! We highly recommend Jake as a DJ for your wedding!

Deep Blue did a fantastic job at making our wedding so much fun!! We really appreciated all the conversations beforehand so we knew they were prepared and ready for our big day. Jonathon did a great job at reading the room and getting the right songs in the queue. We would recommend this crew for anyone looking for the most fun DJ!
