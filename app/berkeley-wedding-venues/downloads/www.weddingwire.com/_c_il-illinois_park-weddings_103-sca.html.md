From the very beginning, Tiffany (our Event Coordinator) was the definition of professionalism- organized, responsive and one of our biggest cheerleaders throughout the planning process. Her communication was seamless and prompt, which made the months leading up to our wedding completely stress-free. We trusted her and her team wholeheartedly, and they delivered beyond anything we could have imagined. On the big day, we were absolutely blown away by how beautiful and perfectly executed our ceremony and reception spaces were. Every detail was thoughtfully considered, and the quality of service was truly out of this world. Tiffany and her team brought our vision to life with such care and excellence, we can't thank them enough for making our day so magical.

The Relish team at Independence Grove was wonderful from beginning to end. From our incredible food tasting experience, to the communication leading up to our wedding, to the day itself, we were stunned by how beautiful everything was, including the people who made it all possible. Colleen, our day-of coordinator, was a gem and made the whole experience easygoing and truly magical. We were able to share what we wanted our DIY decorations to look like and the team made that dream a reality. All of our guests commented for weeks later how much they loved the food, especially the butternut gnocci! The area around the main venue space was also gorgeous, even in late November, so we got incredible photos inside and out. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a dreamlike wedding!

'm a florist and could have had my daughter's wedding anywhere as I have a lot of connections. I even had a venue say "hey you do a lot of weddings here and we love you and you can have the venue for free". We still chose Victoria in the Park for Nov 15,2025. Why? Everything is perfection there, the food is out of this world, steak is like from a steak house downtown restaurant, customer service is impactable, everyone is courteous and smiling and attentive to your guests. We had our venue manager leave about 6 months leading up to the wedding and we were devastated but Lucy picked up and took over and did not skip a beat. Clear communication even on her day off, accommodating just a dream overall. Our guests had the best experience and so did our daughter and her husband. The overall look of the venue is stunning and so gorgeous to begin with. The day was 100% Gorgeous from start to finish. I would do it again in a heart beat, WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!

We hosted our wedding at Cantigny Park this past weekend and it was the most wonderful experience ever! The staff was professional, friendly and went above and beyond with their service on our wedding day. All of our guests could not stop raving about the food and service they received and how our ceremony in the Rose Garden was absolutely beautiful. Amanda and Phoebe are both so kind and made the planning process so seamless from the beginning! We cannot wait to visit Cantigny again to reminisce on our perfect day and highly recommend booking your wedding here!

My husband and I got married at Whispering Woods in August 2024. Choosing WW was by far the best decision that we made! When we got engaged, we had no idea where to start with wedding planning but knew we wanted a beautiful venue with an outdoor ceremony. We found Whispering Woods on The Knot, and the owner, Bear, got us set up with a tour quickly after reaching out. It was about 2 hours from our home, so we were a bit hesitant, but as soon as we got there, all doubts disappeared! The venue itself is absolutely breathtaking, and we were blown away. I loved that there were multiple gorgeous options for the ceremony to take place! Bear was incredibly kind and easygoing and answered all of our questions. He encouraged us to think about it, but we were totally sold. Within 2 weeks, we had our contract signed. Bear was great, and let us set up multiple additional tours with our families over the course of the year leading up to our wedding. We were able to set up the day before our actual wedding and able to have our whole wedding party come out to help! Bear helped us set up the tables/ceremony chairs and gave us advice on what would look best and what would be easiest when we had our guests there the next day. I could have put final touches on everything all night, but Bear and his wife Kimber assured me everything was perfect and made sure we didn't stay up the whole night! The day of our wedding, Bear and Kimber helped to direct our guests and made sure everything was running smoothly. They had a golf cart to help some of our elderly family members, along with myself, to get to the ceremony location. I was visibly nervous and Kimber was so incredibly sweet, she helped ease my mind. She again assured that everything was perfect and I should be excited for everything to come that day and the future for my husband and I. Our ceremony was beautiful and the reception was even better! The whole thing was a dream come true! Our guests are still telling us how gorgeous the venue was and how fantastic Bear was, helping with things throughout the night. Our other vendors were also very appreciative of how easy WW is to work with. The next day, they helped us organize some of our leftover decorations and even let us leave some for future couples/events! We were happy to add to their closet collection of decor and last-minute wedding essentials! They have an incredible system and use or donate anything left over, so nothing goes to waste! It's another example of how much they really care about their property and the people/events they have. We are forever grateful to Bear, Kimber, and everyone at Whispering Woods! We can never thank you all enough for allowing us to have our dream wedding! If you're looking for a place to have a wonderful event, please reach out to Whispering Woods. you will not be disappointed!

We could not have asked for a more beautiful, seamless venue than Blumen Gardens! Planning our wedding without a wedding planner was definitely overwhelming at first, but once we found Blumen, it really felt like everything started to fall into place. From the moment we visited, we knew it was the one, the garden was already so beautiful that we didn’t feel the need to add anything more. One of the biggest things we appreciated was how they allowed outside catering, which gave us the freedom to choose what we wanted for the food. On top of this, the indoor reception space was already decorated with beautiful string lights and had that perfect rustic charm we were looking for. The team at Blumen was amazing to work with. Britney was so kind, responsive, and accommodating from the beginning, always willing to answer our (many) questions. As our guest counts changed, she and the team were so flexible and worked closely with us to help adjust the layout and plans. They even offered rentals for signage and decor (which we honestly wish we had used more of instead of buying our own!). Blumen Gardens also made it easy for us to stay organized. Even without an official wedding planner, they provided clear timelines for when they needed info like our schedule, vendor contacts, layout, and rehearsal details. On the day of the wedding, Alyssa, Bridget, and the rest of the Blumen team were everywhere making sure everything ran smoothly. Their presence and support gave us so much peace of mind. The entire day felt like a dream come true, and we’re so thankful to the team at Blumen Gardens for helping bring our dream wedding vision to life. Also, their off-season discounts helped us stay on budget, and they never pressured us into using their rentals or bar services. If you're looking for a venue that’s naturally beautiful, flexible, & staffed with kind people who truly care; Blumen Gardens is it!!

Holy cow. I grew up in Harvard, I've driven down 47 hundreds of times and I had no idea that the sanctuary that is The Gardens of Woodstock was there, in fact all of the local guests had no idea that something so beautiful was hidden away there. We had so many compliments on our venue and the staff! Our guests enjoyed being able to walk around the gardens and take pictures. Mike was great! He was easy to work and communicate with. We worked with the preferred caterer, which made things very easy for table linens and whatnot. Included in our total spent at the venue was the open bar. The ladies running the bar were fabulous! We absolutely loved getting married at the Gardens of Woodstock and couldn't have imagined a better venue! The Gardens were breathtaking. The bridal suite is everything you could possibly need. The heated reception tent kept everyone warm on a chilly October night and the fire outside of the tent was a plus! Our wedding was absolutely perfect. I couldn't recommend a better venue!

We were very happy with the Morton Arboretum and Ginkgo Catering for our June wedding! Our ceremony was in the beautiful Founders Room, and our reception was just down the hall in the Arbor Room. Jennie and Lisa, our venue and catering coordinators, were both easy to work with and answered all our questions throughout the process. The food was tasty, and we felt so taken care of by the staff on our big day! Also, one of the biggest reasons we chose the Morton Arboretum is because of their dedication to sustainability and environmentalism. It was so reassuring to know that our money went toward such an important organization and that they follow sustainable practices, like composting uneaten food instead of just tossing it. This is probably the most waste-producing event we’ll ever host, so having a venue that cares about sustainability was incredibly important to us. We definitely recommend the Morton Arboretum!

The absolute dream venue!!! The events team was so professional, had great communication, and was very kind. Anyone who has ever had the honor to visit the gardens knows the natural beauty and how well kept it is. I was able to take a tour and discuss the different areas available to host a wedding. We ended up having the ceremony and cocktail hour in the Rose Garden with reception in the McGinley Pavilion overlooking the lake. The Rose Garden had a natural isle with a tall wall of trees on each side which was gorgeous. The team did a great job setting up and blew my expectations out of the water. They have an on-site catering team which is top notch. During our tasting, the chef came out and personally introduced himself and was open to customizations but honestly the food tasted like a 5 star restaurant we didn't change a thing!!! I really wanted to create a magical experience for our guests and this was the perfect venue to do that. Lots of parking available, they create custom signs pointing your guests in the right direction, have on site security to ensure the safety of your guests, and don't even get me started on the AMAZING catering team. They came out like an army, so in sync to serve the food. Never interrupted speeches, and the nobody's glass was ever empty. They even assigned one staff member to the bride and groom who did an excellent job and made sure we were taken care of. I worked directly with Michelle from events planning and she is a rock star. I gave her a huge hug after the ceremony and will forever be grateful for all she did. Plus a huge perk of having your wedding at CBG is you don't need much florals... you are submerged in a work of art!! No need to add much at all, let the beauty of the venue speak for itself. All in all, this is a high end venue that I highly recommend for any couple looking for an out of this world experience on their wedding day. All of our out of town guests are still talking about how it was the best wedding they have ever been too. Ditch the boring banquet halls and host your wedding at the CBG!!
