We had an amazing experience at this venue! The property is beautifully maintained, and the grounds made for such a stunning backdrop to our wedding. We loved having the venue for three days—it made the whole weekend feel relaxed and special, and it was so much fun having our bridal party stay with us on-site. The staff were incredibly helpful and responsive throughout the entire process, making everything run smoothly. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate!

We knew we wanted to have an intimate and relaxed wedding/reception with our families (and dog!) so Wolf Cove seemed like the perfect venue and when we reached out in the spring, we were thrilled that they were able to accommodate us for our 11-person wedding there less than 4 months later. During the planning process, Nicole was so wonderful to work with and very responsive to all of our questions. The Wolf Cove micro wedding package really helped streamline decision making, while also enabling us to customize our big day as much as we wanted. We decided to add extra florals and a lobster bake dinner for our party the night before the wedding, which was wonderful! The chefs are so talented – all of the food was so delicious and we also loved the creative cocktails at the beautiful new bar. They even accommodated our desire to have the wedding dinner outside by the lake, where we were treated to the most incredible sunset! Wolf Cove is truly such a magical place – our entire wedding party felt relaxed from the moment we checked in and went for a swim in the lake until the day we left, after enjoying the sauna/ice bath on the property. Nicole and Geoff are such wonderful and kind people – their passion for their work comes across in all that they do and they made our entire party feel completely at home during our stay. We will certainly be back!

The Thomas Delano House was the absolute perfect choice for our October wedding in Portland. We stayed there for the weekend with both sides of our families and hosted our ceremony and farewell brunch in the garden. The house itself is extremely charming and comfortable for a group of 18 that included several toddlers and grandparents. Everyone had plenty of space to relax, cook together, and enjoy late nights around the outdoor fire. The house was well stocked for cooking and family dinners. The barn is heated and is the perfect hangout on chilly evenings. The garden was the most beautiful, intimate setting for both our wedding ceremony and our farewell brunch the next morning. Kristen and Steve went above and beyond—offering to coordinate both events and completely exceeding my expectations. They provided all the chairs, champagne glasses, and a delicious high-quality brunch so we could simply enjoy every moment. From the very beginning, Kristen and Steve were amazing to work with—warm, responsive, and genuinely dedicated to making our weekend special. They referred us to local vendors and even introduced us to Christa, who became our day-of coordinator and felt like a fairy godmother. I was so grateful to work with such incredible partners for our wedding weekend. It’s clear that Kristen and Steve care deeply about both the history of the house and the joy of celebrating there. I highly recommend this venue if you’re looking for an intimate celebration and a memorable weekend!

Lori and everyone else at Boothbay Railway Village helped us make all of our wedding dreams come true. Incredible coordination, flexibility, and the venue is tough to beat. Ample space indoors and out, trains, cars, goats, what more could you ask for? The highlight was the steam train rides that the wedding party and guests were able to enjoy during our cocktail hour. Our guests had never seen anything like it!

Due to the COVID pandemic, my now husband and I had to completely replan our wedding to abide by state guidelines. We changed our wedding venue to Rockcraft Lodge a month and a half before our wedding and I am SO happy we did. They were so easy to work with even just a month before the big day! Rockcraft is the most beautiful place for a wedding. The grounds were perfectly manicured with beautiful landscaping and the house made for a perfect "mini moon". All of our wedding party even got to stay at the house for the weekend. All our guests were blown away with how beautiful the property was. We hope to rent Rockcraft again in the future with our close friends and family. We didn't want to ever leave!

I can't stress how wonderful this venue was. Planning - The wonderful lady in charge - Pat - was more than willing to show us around and give us a history of the building. We had a non traditional wedding (horror themed) and she was receptive and excited for us! She answered any questions quickly, and even went above and beyond. Her sense of humor kept me sane throughout the whole planning process. The contract was clear, they recommended a great vendor for food (even though we ended up catering it ourselves), and the willingness to work with our other vendors time frames was fantastic. The wedding/reception - Pat was a huge emotional support during this. From offering a neat decoration to add to the wedding, directing folks where they needed to go, helping out with various things needed (without being expected to), and making sure the place was spotless... it was done! She kept smiles on the guests face and made the experience even nicer! She worked with us to provide a "quiet" spot to allow our guests to go to get away from the noise of the wedding, and also to make sure out guests who needed special accommodations were well taken care of. Clean up - Pat was VERY flexible on the clean up. Our crew was great, but our wedding had a lot of stuff. She worked with us on a schedule for us to get all our stuff, while still giving us a moment to breathe after the wedding. Venue itself - Beautiful. All my guests were stunned by the architectural highlights of this building. It provides amazing acoustics, and I am sure more than one of my guests decided to sing in there! The pictures that I have of the sun coming through the stained glass windows as I walk down the isle take my breath away. They have done so many renovations to this building, and the money that you give to them for the venue (which, by the way, is the cheapest venue in Portland that I found) goes to renovating the building even more. I love this place!

The Historical of Wells and Ogunquit is in an historic Meetinghouse. They were my wedding ceremony saviors when a Nor'easter was predicted to come the day my outdoor ceremony was supposed to occur. With just a few days notice, we were able to reserve the space for our ceremony to take place in what is the quintessential New England Wedding Setting! The woman who ran the space couldn't have been a nicer person. Everyone loved the location and the setting. And the cost was unbeatable!

I loved, loved, loved my experience with Royal Oak room. In the year between booking the venue and my wedding day, Wayne was over-the-top helpful, responsive, and accommodating. Although I tried my best to not be overly fussy, he helped me add some unique touches to my day including the use of hanging plants and greenery in the court yard, a few hand-selected spirits and wines -- each as a nod to places my family is from -- and making sure staff was on hand to serve champagne to my guests (since the caterers and wait staff could not handle any liquor and beer). The venue is very reasonably priced, included chairs/tables and pews if you want your ceremony to be there too, and offers the option of renting plates, cups, etc. I ended up renting all my tableware since it was a lot easier than having it all brought in. By the way, the kitchen here is magnificent; my caterer was ecstatic. Fully equipped, very up-to-date and sizable enough to handle a large team. There was even a place for the catering van to back directly into the kitchen door. Above all, everyone was amazingly friendly on my wedding day. I know it sounds like a "duh, they're working for you" kind of comment, but I cannot overstate how much they were able to add to my happiness that day. They seemed more like old friends than folks I had just met earlier that day. I'm so appreciative to have been around such fantastic people for what could have been a very stressful day. If you can't tell, I heartily recommend Wayne, his staff, and The Royal Oak Room as a whole.

The Hamilton House is a perfect setting for an intimate outdoor wedding. We were extremely lucky with the weather, which only added to the beauty of the venue. The grounds themselves are stunning, and you can truly use the whole property to your advantage—for both photography and the flow of your wedding events. We held our ceremony in the main garden, cocktail hour in the side gardens near the visitor’s center, and then moved into a tent in the main field for the reception. It felt seamless and gave each part of the day its own unique atmosphere. For photos, we had endless variety: the field, gardens, riverfront, and (with permission) even inside the Hamilton House, the visitor’s center, and the charming sitting area tucked off one of the bathrooms. That sitting area actually became a surprise highlight—it worked perfectly as a small “bridal room.” It has a mirror, countertop, and just enough space to freshen up or stay hidden before the ceremony. I hadn’t known it existed beforehand, but it turned out to be incredibly convenient. Another huge advantage was being allowed to rehearse and have our vendors start setting up the day before. This made the morning of the wedding so much more relaxed. We were also able to leave décor with our day-of coordinator overnight, though everything did need to be packed up and taken out by the end of the wedding night. It’s important to know that the venue is a true blank slate—you need to bring in everything, from restrooms and chairs/tables to catering equipment. This definitely adds to both the cost and the planning required, but the trade-off is complete creative freedom to bring your wedding vision to life exactly as you imagine it. Additionally, there is no indoor rain plan. While we were fortunate not to need one, I can imagine it would limit the ability to fully use the property if the weather didn’t cooperate. Parking is plentiful, but be aware that cars are visible from the tent area. Once the sun sets it becomes less noticeable, but during daylight it can take away a bit from the atmosphere. I’d highly recommend arranging transportation for guests—not only to reduce the number of visible cars but also because Uber/Lyft service is very limited in the area. The majority of our guests stayed in Portsmouth, which was an easy and convenient drive to the venue. The only real downside for us was the Historic New England staff. While professional, they were not as warm or welcoming as we had hoped. At times it felt like our presence was more of an inconvenience than a celebration, which was disappointing energy to start the wedding day with. It certainly didn’t overshadow the beauty of the venue, but it’s worth noting for couples who value a more hospitable, enthusiastic staff presence. Overall, Hamilton House is a breathtaking and versatile venue for couples looking for a romantic and intimate outdoor wedding. With some logistical planning and managed expectations, it can be the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable day.

We had our wedding reception at the schoolhouse. we had it setup for 100 people and it fit everybody with room to spare. The schoolhouse with beautiful and Mary was so wonderful to deal with. The only negative is the building only has one large bathroom, so I would suggest renting a porta potty.
