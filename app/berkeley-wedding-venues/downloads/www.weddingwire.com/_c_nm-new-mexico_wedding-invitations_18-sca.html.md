We left our invitations a little late, but were still able to efficiently get truly beautiful invitations from Pennysmiths. We got so many compliments on our invites, they handled the invitation addressing, and we got them to our guests in a timely manner despite our late start.

WOW!! We just saw our wedding certificate and are blown away. It is absolutely STUNNING!! Elizabeth is an extremely talented artist, definitely one of the best calligraphers out there. We are so happy to display this beauty in our home. She created just what we wanted in her own beautiful style. I just can’t say enough of how great a calligrapher and painter she is. If you are looking for something special, this is your girl!! Thanks again Elizabeth. We’ll send wedding pictures <3

Kimberly Stone could not be more talented and you won't find better quality. Our invitations were unique to us and I lost count of how many compliments we received. They are one of my most treasured keepsakes! I highly recommend Tall Blonde Photography!

Theresa is great and you can tell she loves what she does 100%. Our wedding invitations, place cards, marriage certificate, gift tags, and programs were beautiful. The detail Theresa puts into her work is phenomenal. My husband and I could not have been more pleased. Theresa is highly professional and we would recommend her services to anyone who wants a magical wedding.

Working with Stephanie at Plane Paper Stationary is a dream. When we first contacted her for our wedding invitations, we were in the beginning stages of wedding planning and didn’t even have a venue. But that didn’t stop her. She wanted to know my fiancé and I’s story & understand our vision. Since we were still in the beginning stages, I was only able to give her a few ideas and yet she was able to whip up a mockup within a couple days. When I first saw it, I got emotional because it was so cool to see the ideas in my head come to life! I think Stephanie is truly talented to be able to do that. When she sent that first mockup, she reassured me that she wanted my complete honest opinion & that she’d change whatever I wanted her to change. Although it was already beautiful, that meant a lot to me because I admit that I can be quite Type A / meticulous about details! And after asking for only a couple of changes, she achieved our dream wedding invitations! Before we even pinned down a venue! So, she waited until we got one. Once we did, she quickly added in the details and sent us the invitations in the same week! Since I consider myself pretty meticulous, I was shocked by how quick & easy the entire process was! I almost cried when I saw the invitations in my hands. I’m so grateful for Stephanie’s creativity & speedy communication! I will recommend her for anyone’s invitation needs!!
