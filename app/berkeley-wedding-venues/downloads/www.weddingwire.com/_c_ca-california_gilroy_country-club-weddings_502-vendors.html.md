Buckle up, because this is going to be a long review. I want to make sure no stones are left unturned, because the only thing more amazing than the venue itself, is the staff that helped make our day possible. A short abbreviated version of this feedback is at the bottom of all of this. Where do I even begin!! When Dylan asked me to marry him, I remember feeling super happy and also I felt an overwhelming sense of stress looming over me knowing that we would now be entering the wedding planning phase. My Instagram algorithm must have felt that stress, because Wedgewood became a targeted ad that kept popping up in my feed. So I looked up all the venues that caught my eye and Eagle Ridge was one of them. Wedgewood made the entire planning process so seamless, and I love that each venue partners with local vendors. The team was available and quick to answer any outstanding questions we had, and the planning materials we were given helped guide us through the whole process without feeling overwhelmed. We had JUST enough meetings to where we felt everything was addressed. We never felt overly stressed or not taken care of by the Eagle Ridge Team. Also, having a lot of our expenses included in one place made things SO easy. We are based in Oakland, so Eagle Ridge was going to be a stretch since it was so far, but I cannot even begin to express how glad we are that we chose this venue. We knew our guest list would be big, so we needed a venue that was close to a variety of hotels and also had accommodating parking! Aside from that, Eagle Ridge had that vintage, warm, romantic feel that we were looking for. It was hard to envision as we were going in for meetings what it would be like on a wedding night, but the photos they gave us provided a really good example of what things COULD look like, and the venue far exceeded our expectations on the day of. The ceremony space was beautiful, and didn’t need too much to spruce it up. The venue itself is filled with many photo op worthy places for photographers and guests alike, and I love that the bar is built in. The way that Eagle Ridge is described on the Wedgewood site is 100% accurate to what it feels like on your wedding day. Priscilla and Jennifer helped us throughout our planning process. Priscilla gave us the first tour and walked us through, and that very same day, we called and put our deposit down to book the venue. As time went on, both Priscilla and Jennifer were on top of it when it came to answering my millions of tedious questions and sharing photos so I could get a feel of what we wanted. We were planning to DIY a lot so I had to ask for many details of the venue to try and build a vision. Jennifer walked us through our second and third planning meetings and guided us through a very lengthy and complex process with ease. At no time did I feel like I was lost in the planning process with Jennifer and Priscilla available to help whenever I reached out. We met Casey on the day of the wedding fair at Eagle Ridge who was so kind from the moment we introduced ourselves! She helped answer all the questions we had about food and what Eagle Ridge had to offer and remembered us each time she saw us even though our visits to Eagle Ridge were minimal! She was also a monumental help on the day of the wedding, stepping in to help make drinks behind the bar when the lines were long, making sure everything was operating smoothly as the night went on, and even stopping to check in on us as well as snap a few photos of us with our disposable cameras! Kelly Jackson was our coordinator for the day. She did a thorough walkthrough with us all during our rehearsal and made sure that we all understood what was needed from each of us. She did a thorough check through the checklist of items that we dropped off as well. I had printed guides for how to set things up, but for the most part, I just gave high level instructions and told her that I trusted her and her team to set things up the way they felt it fit best. I left some extra decoration items as well, and said they were optional to use if they wanted to. The biggest thing I left up to their discretion was our arch. We made the floral sprays for it but didn't know what to do with the draping. Let me just say, I was so unbelievably impressed with how everything turned out. Kelly and the team that set up our wedding absolutely KILLED it!!! Everything was so beautifully set up, the arch was better than I could have done myself, the ceremony space was so beautiful, and all the signage was set up perfectly. As a Type-A personality, it felt hard to relinquish control over the small details, but the Eagle Ridge team made me feel comfortable and I didn’t think twice about it. They most certainly delivered! I want to also mention that Kelly kept us on time and managed our schedule as best as she could despite us running a little late. She made sure that our grand entrance stayed on time and that we weren’t getting too lost in getting photos taken. She also captured a photo of us on the way out of the ceremony space after the ceremony and printed and framed it for us to take home. That photo is currently on our mantle in our living room and I cannot be thankful enough for how thoughtful of a gift that was. She captured a really beautiful moment between my husband and I. Our banquet captain, Xochi Camacho-Lopez, was an absolute boss that night! She kept things running smoothly and really made sure we were taken care of. I saw her working so hard the whole night, and I made sure to express my gratitude as much as I could whenever I had the chance. She was ON IT the entire night! She made sure our drinks got to our table, and that drinks got brought back to us as soon as we were ready to sit down. As an LA Native, the best comparison I have is how Phil Jackson was to Kobe Bryant. On the court, Kobe kind of just knew what Phil Jackson needed and vise versa. They didn’t have to talk to each other to know what the next move had to be. That was the same intuition Xochi had. She was around when I needed her, she was quick to act and responsive to any requests I made. At no point in time was I wondering where she was, because she was always close by to help when needed! I think I must have hugged Xochi like one hundred times that night just because of how amazing she was and how thankful I was to her. She packed up our things so neatly at the end of the night and made it super easy to pack our things into our cars. Our bartenders were amazing that night and were working in overdrive to get our guests their drinks! We had two shotskis going as well as people asking for different mixed drinks, and they made sure to take care of all our guests! Lastly, the staff that worked the evening, in the kitchen and around the hall, were super kind and very quick and efficient. The team that we had on our wedding day was an all star team and I cannot thank them enough for making this day perfect for us. Last mention - the food was soooooo GOOD!!! The cocktail hour food was so amazing I wish I had asked for more, I could have honestly eaten those all night! I’m usually skeptical about wedding food but it was so incredible. Everything about this day was perfect. We opted out of draping and any arbor draping for the ceremony space because we knew we had chosen a space that was just architecturally beautiful as it is. It’s not often that you can just walk into a venue and be like “yeah, it’s actually so beautiful just the way it is.” I would recommend Eagle Ridge to anyone who is considering going through Wedgewood for their wedding planning service. I’ll say it again, yes the building and the venue itself is beautiful, but it’s the team that truly makes the experience what it is. If you want to feel taken care of, seen, heard and like you can trust people the moment you go hands off, Eagle Ridge is it. I will be replaying this day over and over and over again in my head for as long as I live, and it’s all thanks to the work that the team that helped us through it all put into it. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!! SHORT VERSION: I would recommend Eagle Ridge to anyone over and over and over again. They set the bar so freakin’ high for what a planning team, event team and venue should be for weddings. The staff are incredible. Big shout outs to Priscilla, Jennifer, Casey, Kelly and Xochi. The process from beginning to end was enjoyable and memorable, all because of the staff. Special thanks to Jennifer, Priscilla and Casey for being so attentive and responsive to us during the planning process. They made everything so easy and manageable for us. On the night of our wedding, Casey even stepped in when the bar got busy and was helping out and making drinks. She is honestly so awesome! The food is so GOOD!! Weddings are always hit or miss when it comes to food, but Eagle Ridge kitchen really delivered! Eagle Ridge had that vintage, warm, romantic feel that we were looking for. It was hard to envision as we were going in for meetings what it would be like on a wedding night, but the photos they gave us provided a really good example of what things COULD look like, and the venue far exceeded our expectations on the day of.

I left some extra decoration items as well, and said they were optional to use if they wanted to. A little side note on Kelly, she is really amazing and kept us on schedule and kept things moving at thee start of the day. She helped us feel comfortable and was super thorough when we went through all the items we dropped off. She's also just so sweet and easy to work with. Nothing but smiles and warm energy the whole way through! The biggest thing I left up to her and the teams discretion was our arch. We made the floral sprays for it but didn't know what to do with the draping. Let me just say, I was so unbelievably impressed with how everything turned out.

Our Banquet Captain Xochi also was a total boss!! She made sure the night ran smoothly and I never found myself looking for her, she was always close by if I needed her help on something. She had great intuition and sometimes had a solution before I even asked her for anything! The second we got in, she walked up to us with drinks in hand and said "I figured you'd want these!" and she was right! The night went off without a hitch because of Xochi and her attentiveness! I’ll say it again, yes the building and the venue itself is beautiful, but it’s the team that truly makes the experience what it is. If you want to feel taken care of, seen, heard and like you can trust people the moment you go hands off, Eagle Ridge is it.
