Five-star wedding venue for small wedding

We held our small reception and ceremony at The Sea in 2016, which left us an excellent impression and memory with all of our intimate friends and families. The room was exactly arranged and set up as what we expected. I especially liked that they have a small patio connected to the room which can be used as a red carpet walkway when the doors are open. The staff there were very gentle, helpful and attentive. Eddie, the manager was very kind and thoughtful. Our communication was smooth and productive. Highly recommend this place as a wedding venue!

I had my wedding reception here in August of 2016, and it was definitely an unforgettable experience. Eddie the event coordinator made planning my reception so simple and stress free. He not only responds to emails quickly, but also is able to handle any request you throw at him. The food was exactly what you'd expect from a 5 star gourmet restaurant, and the wine selection is something our friends still rave about to this day. I have absolutely no regrets choosing The Sea for my wedding reception!
