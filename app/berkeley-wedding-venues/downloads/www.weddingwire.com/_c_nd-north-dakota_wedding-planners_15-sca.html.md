I hired Renee as my wedding planner and she did an amazing job from beginning to end!! She recommended the best vendors for photographers, wedding cake, flowers, venue, etc. She was also the point of contact which really helped with the process. She reviewed contracts and always had my best interest in mind. She took my vision and brought it to life! If you want your wedding planning to be stress free, hire Renee! It was the best decision I made. She is very professional, organized, always responded in a timely manner and is easy/fun to work with! Knowing Renee had everything under control on my wedding day allowed me to relax and fully enjoy the day!
