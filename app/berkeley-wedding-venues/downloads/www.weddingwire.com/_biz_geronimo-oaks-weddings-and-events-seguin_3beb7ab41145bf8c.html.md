Located between San Marcos, Seguin and New Braunfels, Geronimo Oaks is a family owned and operated working ranch. With two unique venues on site, you are sure to fall in love with every aspect - the landscaping, seclusion, and grandeur of the property. Each venue has its own unique design and highlights the Texas Ranch style and the natural rolling terrain of the area. The venues and their accompanying ceremony sites are thoughtfully laid out with customizable floor plans and all the amenities you need for your day to run smoothly.   
  
Make it a whole weekend event with on-property lodging available to rent through VRBO! The Retreat at Geronimo Oaks is a private farm-style rental house located just half a mile from the venues. The large, red party barn out back is perfect for rehearsal dinners and next day brunches. Hotels are conveniently located in Seguin, San Marcos and New Braunfels. Guests can stay the night and experience all that the surrounding cities have to offer.

  
**VENUES:**

Geronimo Oaks Weddings & Events offers 2 unique wedding venues - each with their   
own climate controlled indoor reception space and designated outdoor ceremony space.

**West Texas** \- With 6,200 sq. ft. of indoor, fully climate controlled reception space, you can entertain up to 300 guests in the West Texas venue. Enter the building from the patio through stunning iron arch front doors. White chiffon drapery draws your eyes to the high ceilings and adds an elegant, bridal touch to the gorgeous cedar wood. Sliding barn doors on either side of the reception space will lead you to The Bluffs ceremony site and a gorgeous rock water feature - where guests can enjoy fresh air. Multiple indoor restrooms are conveniently located for guest use.

**The Creeks** \- This 3,300 sq. ft. venue was once an outdoor stage that was enclosed to create the most   
unique indoor reception space in the area and can entertain up to 175 guests. We kept the integrity and character of the large rock stage to bring some of the natural landscaping indoors. Across from the stage are large windows overlooking The Crossing ceremony space and a sliding barn door perfect for your grand entrance to your reception!

Best. Venue. Ever.

Booking Geronimo Oaks was the best decision my wife and I made in our planning process. We were so hesitant to plan a wedding being a same-sex couple (I know, in 2023 right?!)—but we got a few instant NO’s when we started reaching out to venues, but once we found Jacy at Geronimo Oaks…our entire perspective changed. She never once made us feel unwelcome or unsupported. She guided us in choosing some of our vendors and always answered my questions quickly (and truthfully). The venue itself (The Creeks) felt like a dream come true. We were able to come in the day before and set up FOR FREE and being able to have our family cook for us was so important—all of our guests were so impressed with the friendly staff and immaculate grounds. Our wedding was the best day of my life, and I know without a doubt it was because of Jacy and all the people at Geronimo Oaks. We will 100% continue to recommend them to anyone we meet!

Amazing service!

The grooms suite and bridal suite were comfy, clean and spacious. The staff was on point, they set up all of our tables,and took them down. The staff made sure all trash was taken out throughout the night. The venue was gorgeous, we recieved so many compliments. It was a very beautiful day. We highly recommend Geronimo oaks!

Geronimo Oaks is amazing 

My Husband and I got married 11/1/24 at Geronimo oaks. We used the bigger of the two venues west Texas. Jacy was outstanding from the moment we toured to the day of. She kept us in the loop with the weather, things we might forget and should make sure we bring, she checked on me (the bride) consistently to make sure everything was going smoothly. It is a beautiful venue, the staff is fantastic. I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect day and venue. I got multiple compliments from family and friends of how much they loved the venue.

Geronimo oaks 

Me and my now husband absolutely loved this venue and the people that run it! Jacy and Alli are both very sweet and helpful. We love nature so this was an awesome place to get married at to be surrounded by the beautiful Texas nature. We got married at the creeks, so it was gorgeous and cozy!

Such a gorgeous venue with the most professional and helpful staff!

We got married at their larger venue, West Texas - it was such a beautiful ceremony site and gorgeous reception hall. Our guest count got a little more overwhelming than I had planned, and Jacey helped me plan everything out with seats and tables. She is AMAZING! She helped with any and all questions I had at any point leading up to my wedding. They truly have the most friendly and helpful staff ever- Dylan helped us with flowers that we had forgotten to attach to the arbor at the last minute. Everyone is so nice and helpful I didn’t fret once all day. If you are looking for a gorgeous venue- go take a tour of Geronimo Oaks! You won’t regret it!

Literally perfect!

Being able to have our wedding at Geronimo Oaks was an absolute dream!!! The venue is absolutely gorgeous and was everything we were looking for and dreaming of. The scenery is was sold us for sure, I seriously can’t even put into words how stunning the property is! And the staff was absolutely amazing to work with! Jacy and Alison were quick to respond to any question we had and they both even checked in on my bridesmaids and myself of wedding day which I’m so thankful for! Geronimo Oaks helped us have our dream wedding and we’re so so grateful to them for that!

Beautiful Wedding Venue with Amazing Staff

My now husband and I toured at least 20 different wedding venues until we found Geronimo Oaks. The Manager, Jacy, toured us around the property and through the 1st large venue (West Texas) in which would have been too big for our wedding of only 100 people. We knew coming in that the smaller venue, The Creeks, wasn't available for the date we wanted but decided to tour anyways since we were getting scared we wouldn't be able to find the one. At the end of the tour, Jacy asked if we wanted to just take a peek at the Creeks just in case - And I'm so glad she did. We IMMEDIATELY fell in love and knew we had found our venue. We didn't care that we needed to even change our desired wedding date, we just knew that The Creeks was where we were supposed to be on our big day. We got married on 9/15/23 and it was the best day of my life. Everything was perfect - and I'm forever thankful that Jacy showed us the Creeks when she did. All of the staff were super sweet to work with and extremely helpful. I think that on top of the venue being just gorgeous, the staff who work here, are amazing. I 10/10 recommend Geronimo Oaks.
