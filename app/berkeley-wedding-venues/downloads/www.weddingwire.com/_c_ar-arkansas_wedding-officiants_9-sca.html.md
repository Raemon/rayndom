Paul is my husband's brother-in-law and we were delighted that he was able and willing to marry us. He gave a beautiful message at the ceremony about "second chances" in life (this was a remarriage situation for both of us). A funny moment occurred when he pronounced us husband and wife before we exchanged rings, so we had to back up & do that part. The audience had a good laugh and we have a great memory!

We hired Richard to officiate our wedding last month, he did a terrific job at everything, let my little sister give a second prayer which was so special, and was quick! (everyone loved this part). We met him at a coffee shop before hiring him and got to know him better and were so happy with our decision. We are now friends and couldn't recommend him more!
