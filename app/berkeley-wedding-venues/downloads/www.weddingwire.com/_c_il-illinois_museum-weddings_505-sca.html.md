Michelle and Lisa did great job from the beginning in terms of planning and organizing. They patiently answered all my questions and made sure everything was perfect for me. During the wedding day Lisa was on site and she was very helpful. The venue itself is amazing as well. The hall of immortals is a magical room to get marry, especially if you are a doctor/scientist and a bit nerd :) our photos from the day look awesome. You do not need that much decoration too because the venue itself is like it is predecorated. Everything is so elegant. Your guests can visit the museum during the event too, which our guests really enjoyed. If you are looking for a small wedding ceremony with family and some friends and want to go budget friendly without compromising the elegance, this is the place. I am so happy that i got married here and will recommend all my friends planning to get married :)

Our wedding at the Chicago History Museum was everything we dreamed of and more. While the venue is iconic and beautiful, it was the staff that truly made the night a success. They were professional, highly organized, and communicative throughout the entire process. We were so impressed by their transparency with budgeting. They worked with us to find creative, cost-effective solutions to ensure we got everything we wanted. Huge thanks to Ericka for her incredible coordination and creative eye! She made sure our vision came to life seamlessly. We couldn’t have asked for a better team or a more beautiful setting.

I cannot express enough thanks to the amazing staff members and event planner at the Field Museum. We always dreamed of having our reception at the Field and it was seamlessly brought together through the work of their incredible vendors. The Field brings your event to life and allows your guests to explore exhibits and dance the night away alongside dinosaurs. From our visits with vendors and staff, to emails and phone communication, everyone was highly professional, kind, and accommodating! We cannot recommend the Field enough as a unique venue for your celebration.

As a wedding planner, it can be challenging to constantly work with a new team of vendors. From the first meeting I had with the MCA crew, I knew we would put on a great event together. Hannah and the rest of the staff were so helpful and accommodating, and stayed calm and professional throughout the fast paced (and sometimes stressful) moments of the night. The venue itself was so gorgeous. The museum really transforms into a great event space- especially the dance floor! I love that guests can walk the galleries as well. I also overheard multiple guests talking about how Marisol was the best wedding food they’ve ever had, and as someone who eats *a lot* of catering, I would have to agree! Start to finish the night was a huge success and I look forward to working with the MCA team in the future!

We wanted a space that was beautiful but also children friendly, so the Shedd was an obvious first choice. Planning the wedding was so easy as the Shedd's team was responsive, professional and understanding. We had 300 guests at our wedding and everyone had A BLAST.

We really enjoyed working with Karin and the SAM. We wanted a wedding that reflected us, which meant bringing in lots of random things- bbq catering, our own bartender, staffing company, decorations, etc. So many vendors! Karin worked with all of them to ensure we had the correct insurance as well as how to manage delivery and pick up of items. The price was so reasonable, and we really got to have the wedding that we wanted. If you are hoping for a DIY or wedding that is a little different than usual, SAM is the place to have it. We had both our ceremony and reception there- the front hall was a big enough space to have a cocktail reception for our 95 guests while the room was flipped.
