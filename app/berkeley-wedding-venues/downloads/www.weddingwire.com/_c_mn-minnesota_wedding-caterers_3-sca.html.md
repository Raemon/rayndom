We had Black Woods as the caterers for our wedding this past December, and it was definitely an amazing experience! My husband and I were planning our wedding from out of state, but Molly made it so easy to plan over the phone/email and was willing to meet up with us in person a few times when we traveled to Duluth during the planning process. The food was absolutely AMAZING from the appetizers to the main course, and we had so many wonderful comments from our guests about the quality and food selection. Several guests even told us that it was the best food they had ever eaten at a wedding. I would recommend Black Woods without hesitation to anyone considering getting married in the Twin Ports area!

I have worked with so many caterers in my time working in events and Marna's will always be in my top list of favorites for a few different reasons: Quality, Value, Communication, Kindness and Collaboration. It is incredibly important to have a partner that you can lean on and trust to take care of your clients and make sure guests are happy and have full bellies. And that is Marnas to a T!

Having yummy food was a big priority for us when we were planning our wedding. The Deco Catering exceeded all expectations! We are so pleased with their services; the planning process through the wedding day was so easy with their help and flexibility. We received many compliments on our wedding food - from the butler served unique appetizers to the full dinner to the desserts and late night snacks - our bellies were full and everyone was so happy. We would recommend the Deco for all catering needs!

Green Mill was incredible solid and the price was incredible! They had lots of great options for apps, dinner, dessert, and even add ons like late night pizza. The food was very good, I remember liking it while I was eating it, but it was not so spectacular that I remember it now - which is exactly what we wanted! We got really good food for an excellent price and we could spend the rest of our wedding budget on things that were more important to us. Additionally their staff were communicative and professional, there were no issues day of the wedding, everything went very smoothly!

We had Fork & Flair cater my wedding on 7-19-2025, and they were amazing! They were the only ones that encouraged my cup noodles idea during cocktail hour, and people absolutely loved it. The passed hors d'eurves and dinner was delicious, something people loved talking about too. Throughout the process of planning, they were attentive and fast to respond to any emails I sent. They were very accommodating and the tasting session was so enjoyable. I would definitely recommend Fork & Flair for your wedding!!

I would highly recommend working with Baba's Catering if you are looking for delicious food that is within an affordable price range! From start to finish, Crystal made our catering process super easy. The tasting was wonderful, Crystal was so good at communicating with us and answering all of our questions, and when the wedding day came, everything went smoothly! Baba's is seriously the best wedding food we've ever had, and if you don't believe us, you can ask to 50+ guests at our wedding who said the same thing!
