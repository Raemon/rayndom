If you’re considering getting married here - do it! Kim was phenomenal - she took such exceptional care of us and our loved ones throughout the weekend. The food and lodging were wonderful - our guests were raving about the food and the staff all night!

We simply cannot say enough amazing things about this venue! Michele, our coordinator, was incredible. As soon as we met her we knew she would be the reliable person we could entrust with our special day. She was straight forward, detail oriented, and was always easy to reach. She made sure that everything was exactly to our liking and was so flexible with the changes we made. The owner was incredibly kind, honest, and truly wants all of the people getting married there to simply have the best day. The staff was incredibly friendly to both the wedding party and the guests. Not to mention, the food was delicious! (Our guests were literally raving about the braised beef, steak and cheese egg rolls and the buffalo chicken wontons!) I wish we could repeat that day over and over! Thank you to the staff at Jones River and a special extra thank you to Michele! 10/10 recommend. - Chris & Michaela

We got married at Publick House Historic Inn and it was truly the BEST decision we made. From day one, Allison, Jon, Abby, Paige, and the whole team made us feel completely supported — every question was answered, every detail was handled, and they kept us calm through the chaos of wedding planning so we could actually enjoy the day. Allison was incredible to work with throughout the entire planning process. Her communication was clear, warm, and always timely — she helped us think through the tiniest details, guided us on timing, and made sure we felt confident and stress-free by the time our wedding weekend arrived. On the big day, Jon Pensinger was our rock. He coordinated vendors, managed the timeline, and somehow kept everything running smoothly without us ever feeling rushed. From the baraat to the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception, everything flowed seamlessly — we never had to worry about what came next because Jon and his team were already on it. Chef Ken O’Keefe and his team went above and beyond — the food was incredible, beautifully presented, and tailored to fit our Indian wedding. Our guests are still raving about the dinner and desserts! The venue itself is so charming and historic, but somehow also felt like it was made for us — the perfect setting for our colorful ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. We’ll never forget how cared for we felt and how flawlessly everything came together.

We were able to snag the very last date in September only a few months before our wedding. The Gables does not host weddings during the madness of October in Salem, so we felt extra lucky to get this date. Booking was simple, and Deb easy to work with. She liaised with vendors as they arrived, kept the parking enforcement at bay during load in, and stayed throughout the night to ensure a smooth event at the Gables. We were able to use the Hooper-Hathaway House (originally built in the 1600s!) as a bridal ready room and bathroom, which was amazing. The site is exquisite for any event, and we would suggest, if booking a tent, that you get the clear one to take in the beautiful views of the water. Our guests raved about the venue, and we agree that it could not have been more perfect.

The Boylston Rooms in Easthampton, MA was the perfect venue for our December 2025 wedding with 116 guests. From the moment we toured the space, we were drawn to the wall of windows in the ceremony room, the light and bright industrial feel, and the uniqueness of the venue. It felt special and unlike anything we had seen. The layout is incredibly well thought out, with separate on-site ceremony and reception spaces, two beautiful getting-ready suites, and even a garden terrace for photos. The white walls photograph beautifully and allow your décor to shine without needing much to make the space feel personal. The venue team is truly unmatched. Myles and Erin were a dream to work with throughout the planning process. They were communicative, supportive, and helped elevate our ideas beyond what we imagined. On the wedding day, Myles ensured everything before the ceremony flowed smoothly and took incredible care of us, down to reminding me to breathe and stay present before walking down the aisle. Erin stepped in seamlessly for the evening and made sure the night flowed effortlessly. Logistically, the venue is a dream. The ceremony and reception spaces are right next to each other within the mill, with restrooms and a coat closet nearby, making navigation easy for guests of all abilities. Our guests haven’t stopped commenting on how beautiful the space was and how thoughtful all the details felt. The Boylston Rooms is worth every penny and even helps couples save by offering décor from their stock room. Working with them feels less like a transaction and more like planning an event with friends. You are truly cared for here, and we couldn’t recommend this venue more highly.

The building is absolutely beautiful, didnt really need any decoration - just on the tables and around our guestbook and seating chart. Ryan the onsite manager was very helpful and responsive. It is just an empty venue - there are tables and chairs you can use and twinkle lights hung over the space - but otherwise you do need to bring everything else in. There isnt a kitchen so you need to be careful about your choice of caterer (ours was the best) but there is a great room for storing beverages and with such an amazing open space you can really let your imagination go with your furniture layout. We put our stereo equipment on the balcony so it didnt break the look we had. They didnt have required vendors when we booked so we were able to keep all our costs in check by DIYing the majority of our wedding in a beautiful space.

Getting married aboard the Schooner Thomas E. Lannon was truly the wedding of our dreams. The Gloucester Harbor setting was breathtaking — the sea breeze, the sunset, and the beauty of the boat created an atmosphere that was both romantic and unforgettable. Captain Heath and his crew were absolutely wonderful to work with. They made the entire planning process effortless — communication was clear, every detail was handled professionally, and the day itself went off without a hitch. We were able to just relax and enjoy every moment. Since our wedding, my wife and I have made it a tradition to charter an anniversary sail each year, and every time we’re reminded of how special that first day was. If you’re looking for a unique, intimate, and truly memorable place to say “I do,” I can’t recommend the Schooner Lannon enough. It’s an experience you’ll treasure for a lifetime!

Everyone at Concord's Colonial Inn was fabulous and helped us have the perfect wedding day! From start to finish, we were in good hands. We worked with Chris Tarris (Director of Sales) throughout the planning process. She brought professionalism and care to every question and helped us craft our special day. The venue allowed us to have the ceremony and reception on site and had rooms for our out of town guests and for us to get ready in. The food was also phenomenal!

Village Hall on the Common needs to get more positive attention. I had my ceremony and reception there in October 2021. Patsy, the coordinator, was nice and easy to interact with. I was looking for a dog friendly venue and this place was perfect. The price can't be beat either, as it is owned by the city of Framingham, it was less than half the price as other venues. We had our ceremony and reception upstairs, had cocktail hour downstairs and took photos on the common and on the side of the historic building. I highly recommend.
