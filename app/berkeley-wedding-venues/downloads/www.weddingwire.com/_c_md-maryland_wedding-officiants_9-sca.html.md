We cannot recommend Stacey highly enough as a wedding officiant! From our very first Zoom call, she was incredibly kind and warm, and it was clear she truly cared about getting to know us as a couple. She completely understood our vision for the ceremony and brought it to life in a way that felt personal, meaningful, and authentic to who we are. She was also so responsive during the planning process and made it very easy to work with her. Stacey took the time to learn our story which made the ceremony feel special and unique. On the wedding day, she delivered a beautiful ceremony and we received so many compliments from our guests about how wonderful Stacey was and how much they loved the ceremony. We cannot recommend working with Stacey more!

Where do I start with recommending Kelly as your officiant, for your big day. Kelly made us feel so comfortable to start diving in, and make her apart of our special day. The three of us went to lunch, and started planning the ceremony. She asked great questions to get to know us more. As well as giving positive suggestions, for any changes that needed to be made. She was very organized and prompt in any questions we had, as well as her responses. Kelly and I came up with great ways to incorporate my Jewish heritage. She has great ideas and always is professional. We 100% recommend Kelly. She is an amazing officiant, but also an amazing person. Without a doubt, she will make your special day all come together.

Our wedding officiant was Katie. We couldn’t have asked for a better wedding officiant. From our very first meeting, she took the time to walk us through the ceremony, explain the flow, and offer thoughtful ways to personalize every part of it. She truly listened to us and made sure the ceremony reflected who we are as a couple. On our wedding day, everything flowed flawlessly while still feeling completely unique and personal. So many of our guests commented on how beautiful and meaningful the ceremony was. We are beyond grateful for her and highly recommend her to any couple looking for an unforgettable ceremony.

We are so grateful to have had Angie as our wedding officiant! From the moment we started working with her, she was incredibly attentive and worked closely with us to craft a unique and beautiful ceremony that truly reflected our personalities and values. Angie took the time to understand our vision, incorporating the readings we selected and ensuring the ceremony was personal and meaningful. She did an amazing job fitting our ceremony seamlessly into the timeline of our big day. Despite a busy schedule, she was organized and kept everything on track, making sure we could enjoy every moment without feeling rushed. Angie was also very accommodating of our ideas, bringing her own warmth and excitement to the ceremony. Her energy and joy were contagious, and she truly made our wedding day unforgettable. We cannot recommend Angie enough. She is a professional, caring, and thoughtful officiant who brings so much heart to the ceremony. Thank you, Angie, for making our wedding day even more special!

We truly cannot recommend Dennis enough! From our very first conversation, we just clicked - he made everything feel so easy and stress-free, which was such a relief since I was planning the entire wedding on my own. Dennis guided us through the process with genuine care and professionalism. After we filled out his questionnaire and shared a few elements we wanted to include, he came back with a first draft of the ceremony script that completely blew us away. It was clear that he really listened to us. We envisioned a very intimate ceremony that included a prayer, our love story, our shared values, and some meaningful personal touches and readings - and Dennis brought it all to life beautifully. His professionalism, warmth and presence on the day made everything feel even more special and heartfelt. If you’re looking for someone who will truly honor your story and make your ceremony unforgettable, Dennis is your guy. He was such a meaningful part of our day, and we’re so grateful to have had him as our officiant.

Me and my husband had an amazing experience with Natalie Tyler. She was so responsive and provided verbiage for the ceremony for me to choose from and edit to my liking. She was thorough with her questions to ensure a well planned ceremony and she had such a warm and kind demeanor. Meeting her in person on our wedding day was so lovely I can’t say enough good things about our experience working with Natalie. She also handled mailing off our marriage certificate so that we could receive the official copy later. That was also very much appreciated. Thank you Natalie for everything, the Hendersons are forever grateful!

Hugh (leader of the Baltimore Ethical Society) did a wonderful job officiating our wedding. We had a priest as a secondary officiant, and Hugh was very flexible in working with the priest and tweaking the ceremony to make sure it was everything we wanted.
