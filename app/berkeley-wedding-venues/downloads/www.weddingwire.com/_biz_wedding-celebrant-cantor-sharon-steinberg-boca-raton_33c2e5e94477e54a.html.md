Rabbi Sharon Made Our Wedding Sing

Rabbi Sharon Steinberg made our wedding ceremony truly unforgettable. From our very first Zoom call, she was warm, accommodating, and genuinely invested in getting to know us as a couple. She went above and beyond to personalize our ceremony, thoughtfully weaving in our story and even making space for me to perform an original song for my wife—offering her own guitar if I needed it! Her flexibility and encouragement made us feel completely at ease, and her attention to detail ensured that every moment felt meaningful and unique to us.  
  
Not only is Rabbi Sharon a gifted rabbi, but her talents as a cantor added a beautiful, spiritual dimension to our celebration. Her singing was lovely, heartfelt and moving, and her words about love and marriage were both profound and perfectly tailored to our journey together. We felt so lucky to have someone who could provide everything we needed in one person, and who made the distance between New York and Florida feel insignificant (as we live in NYC, but were marrying in FL). We are so grateful for her warmth, wisdom, and artistry in making our wedding day so special.

You can count on Rabbi Sharon to make your day meaningful 

Rabbi Sharon was an incredible resource for our wedding! She helped my husband and I create a Jewish wedding that was also able to honor our families and their interfaith traditions. She was fantastic at communicating with us promptly and answered all of our questions and concerns and gave us options when we wanted to know the whys or hows of parts of the ceremony. She made sure we were confident and confused well before the ceremony and left nothing up to chance. Our families still talk about what a beautiful ceremony it was, and how it went so smoothly and calmly (not all of our relatives have been so lucky!)

Beautiful wedding thanks to Rabbi Sharon 

I write this review about Rabbi Sharon Steinberg. My wife and I were married by Rabbi Sharon in Boca Raton in November, 2022. We could not have been more pleased about our choice.  
We met with Rabbi Sharon at her home approximately one month prior to our wedding. She explained that she would like to get to know us and invited us into her home. We knew instantly that she would be perfect for our wedding. We met three or four times at her home. She planned our wedding using a type of “wedding manual” which outlines a Jewish wedding, and has several options. We shared our love story and our family dynamics. On one visit to her home she created a video for us, whereby she asked us what drew us together, what we envision for our future, where we hope to be when we watch the video. I was a lovely touch.   
Prior to our wedding, Rabbi Sharon created our ketubah, as well as a wedding rehearsal plan, a list of things we should bring for our wedding. As for the wedding itself, Rabbi Sharon is also a Cantor with a magnificent voice and handled the ceremony beautifully. She was admired by all guests of our wedding.   
Once again, my wife and I can’t speak highly enough about Rabbi Sharon Steinberg.  
Yours sincerely,  
Mike Abelson

Wonderful experience

We are so deeply grateful to Rabbi-Cantor Sharon Steinberg for leading us through the most beautiful and meaningful Ketubah ceremony. From the very beginning, she centered the ceremony around our love and made every moment feel personal and sacred. Rabbi Sharon went above and beyond to ensure the ceremony was accessible to my Grandma, which meant the world to us.  
  
She also found the most thoughtful ways to incorporate both of our families, making everyone feel included and connected. It was truly a special and unforgettable experience. Her warmth, presence, and genuine care made this moment even more memorable. Thank you, Rabbi Sharon, for giving us a ceremony that was not only deeply spiritual, but also full of heart.

Jeff and Tobi

Shirat Sharon performed the wedding ceremony for my wife and me in 2021. She was absolutely amazing! She helped us clearly understand and talked us through every aspect of the wedding, making the entire preparation process easy and enjoyable.   
  
During the ceremony itself, she demonstrated strong love and devotion for us and our union through her kind words and deep feelings. Shirat Sharon made our wedding day feel profound and unforgettable.  
  
I have been to many weddings, and I can say without any hesitation that Shirat Sharon in the best.

Wonderful Experience!

Working with Rabbi Sharon on our interfaith wedding was a breeze! The pre-ceremony counseling sessions were insightful and well thought out, and Rabbi Sharon's genuine interest in us as a couple made us feel great. Rabbi Sharon traveled for our elopement and was professional and personal the whole time - she filled our special day with spirit, laughter, and song. I highly recommend her for any interfaith couple (or any couple in general) looking for an empathetic, understanding officiant for their wedding.

Such an amazing accommodating Rabbi! 

We needed a Rabbi who would be willing to officiate a Jewish wedding Ceremony between an interfaith couple (my husband is Christian and I am Jewish), and out of all the Rabbis in south Florida only 3 were willing to do so; out of those only 2 were willing to do it on a Saturday which is Shabbat. After speaking on the phone and realizing how friendly and pleasant Rabbi Sharon was, we decided to go with her. She had very reasonable prices, and we were very happy that she took the time to get to know each of us and make sure to personalize our ceremony catering to both of our faiths. We were blown away by her kindness, singing voice and wonderfully curated ceremony. I will always recommend Rabbi Sharon, as she made our day amazing, and truly special!

Unforgettable

We had a Jewish and Hindu fusion wedding, and Sharon did a phenomenal job creating a ceremony that was both deeply meaningful and beautifully inclusive of both our cultures. She took the time to understand our values and traditions, and crafted a service that felt authentic, personal, and heartfelt. Her calm presence and warm energy helped set the tone for a truly unforgettable day. We’re so grateful she was part of our wedding.

Rabbi Steinberg conducted a beautiful wedding on short notice. The wedding occurred in our home with relatively few attendees, however, Rabbi Steinberg suggested that we have friends and relatives who could not attend watch remotely using an application designed for this purpose. This worked out very well.  
Her beautiful and meaningful wedding service was supplemented by her musical talents. She played piano, guitar and sang when appropriate. We highly recommend Rabbi Steinberg to lead any Jewish ceremony.

Rabbi Sharon was a great officiant for our interfaith wedding ceremony. She worked well with our Catholic officiant and together they provided us with a lovely wedding that combined aspects and traditions reflecting both faiths. She was a pleasure to work with and a great resource throughout our engagement. We would highly recommend!
