_**Happily Ever After Starts in Bloom!**_

Flourish Foliage Co. owner and designer, Alyssa Doucette, believes that every love story is a little bit magical — and your flowers should be too. From the first petal to the final “I do,” we create floral designs that capture the feeling of your day: romantic, whimsical, and wonderfully you. Whether your wedding is local in the picturesque White Mountains of New Hampshire, or a little further away in the Lakes Region, or even on the coast of Maine and beyond, Flourish is dedicated to making your vision come alive!

**_The Consultation_**  
It all begins with your story. During your floral consultation, we’ll talk about your vision, your favorite blooms, your colors, and your vibe — from “wild garden romance” to “moody woodland magic.” Together, we’ll dream up designs that reflect you and make your wedding feel truly personal.

_**The Bouquets**_  
Your bouquet is your floral love letter — a gathering of blooms that tells your story in color and texture. We handcraft each bouquet to feel natural, airy, and full of movement, so it looks like it was plucked straight from an enchanted garden.

_**The Ceremony**_  
This is where the magic begins. From lush floral arches and whimsical aisle meadows to delicate touches on chairs and altars, we’ll design ceremony florals that make your vows feel like a fairytale moment.

_**The Reception**_  
Once the “I do’s” are said, the celebration begins! We’ll transform your space with centerpieces, garlands, and floral accents that set the mood — romantic, joyful, and brimming with personality. Every petal plays its part in creating your dream atmosphere.

_**Let’s Create the Magic**_  
Ready to start your floral journey? Reach out to reserve your date — we can’t wait to bring your wedding dreams to life in full, blooming color.

Wedding Florist 7/19/25

Alyssa and her team were the florists for my wedding in July 2025, I can not say enough good things. They went above and beyond and truly made my vision and more come true. Throughout the whole process they were super accommodating and extremely easy to work with. They checked in numerous times and sent mock ups and arrangements to truly understand what I was looking for. They answered all of my questions and I appreciated their guidance with the whole process. They are extremely knowledgable and I could not have picked a better florist to work with. I highly highly recommended Flourish Foliage.

Wedding bouquet 

I sent Alyssa some inspiration photos of flowers I liked, and she went above any beyond to make my dreams come true! She made me a bouquet even more beautiful than the pictures, it was absolutely perfect. I still obsess over it in wedding pictures often. I can’t believe how beautiful it turned out. I highly recommend Alyssa and Flourish Foliage co. for any event! She was quick to respond, checked in periodically, as needed, and even delivered my flowers to me that morning at the hair salon next door.

June 2025 Microwedding

I planned my micro wedding (20 people) in New Hampshire while I was living in Utah. I chose to work with Alyssa from Flourish and it was the best decision I could’ve made. She was extremely patient with me, helped explain all her offerings and plans (I asked A LOT of questions) and her work is incredible. She also met with me before the wedding and pulled off all my beautiful floral arrangements in such a short amount of time. Alyssa will listen to you and make your vision come to life. She’s easy to communicate with, honest, she’s professional and a true artist. 10/10 would recommend her to everyone! :)

Can’t recommend enough!

I contacted Alyssa for a last minute elopement bouquet and admittedly I was asking for a lot—though I was only purchasing just that bouquet I wanted a wide variety of flowers and colors included. The result went above and beyond my expectations. She was able to get me a flower that was nearly out of season, she sent me photos of different flowers to see what I liked, and most of all she was so communicative and so kind. I thought her pricing was more than fair and she explained to me how she was getting her numbers and how florist pricing works in general. I cannot recommend Flourish Foliage enough. Alyssa made my bouquet dreams come true!

Mountain elopement

Alyssa curated the perfect bouquet to be able to withstand a hike up for mountain elopement. On short notice she delivered exactly what I needed for my wedding and even delivered it to my hotel. My photographer was very impressed with the sturdy bag that Alyssa found to secure my flowers. I loved the bouquet so much I am having the flowers pressed to hang in my home to keep forever. Highly recommend Flourish!
