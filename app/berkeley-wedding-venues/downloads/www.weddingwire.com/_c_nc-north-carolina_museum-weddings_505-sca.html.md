The service was quick and responsive, the food was delicious, and my guests had SO much fun. I can't say enough good things about this venue!!! Would definitely recommend.

NCMA has a special place in our hearts, having gone on some of our first dates here back in our college days at UNC and NCSU, and we immediately knew this was where we wanted to get married. Living in California, we were a little nervous about planning a wedding from across the country, but things really couldn't have been easier! Morgan was fantastic -- he took care of all the details that aren't as fun to makes decisions about, and we got to decide on all the things we did care about. The planning process was a dream with the help of Morgan and his team :) Our day went absolutely perfectly, which is a testament to the brilliant work of the folks at NCMA. The timing of the ceremony and reception was impeccable, the atmosphere was like a beautiful dream, and we honestly can't emphasize enough how it really was the best day of our lives. We felt like pinching ourselves the whole evening -- the joy, love, and elation was palpable, filling the museum's gorgeous interior with celebration. We danced all night and loved the buffet/no seating arrangement -- guests mingled and seemed to really take advantage of the free-form setup to just have a great time. And to cap things off, at the end of the night, we discovered three massive to-go boxes filled with scrummy food from Iris in our car, courtesy of Morgan! Thank you all so much for everything!

The CCA was the best place to use for a great event. It is actually an art museum and I attended their art camp when I was younger. So, I have history there. They had chairs and tables that you could use, a grand piano, a winding staircase. Many studio rooms...and a great gallery. It was really nice and afforable. There was also a security man onsite to help with things. It was really nice, and everyone enjoyed it!

I had my ceremony at the Botanical Gardens in November of 2022. The venue was absolutely gorgeous that time of year and I could not have been happier with it. There was a bit of a mix up the morning of the ceremony where the chairs were facing the wrong direction in the ceremony space (there are two different ways it is typically done in that space). What could have been a very big wrench in my day was easily breezed away as the coordinator from the venue assured me it would be fixed immediately, and it was! Everything was just perfect. If you’re looking for a wedding venue in the Fayetteville area it is really hard to beat this one!

We knew we wanted a fun bright wedding venue and we fell in love with Marbles in an instant. They were there for us through a postponement due to Covid, which was heartbreaking to do. We finally got to have our big day at Marbles this passed weekend and it was everything we could have wanted and more. Jennifer helped with ever aspect of our big night, made sure our centerpieces were set up, coordinated, kept close contact running up to the event, and just took such great care of us. We got to play with so many fun things and had so much space to play, which gave people a nice break from the dancing and quiet spaces to relax. 10/10 would do it all over again. Worth every penny.

We booked the Museum of Life and Science for our wedding and 10/10 would recommend! When we started planning our wedding, we knew that we wanted something a little more non-traditional. After touring the Museum of Life and Science, we knew it was the perfect fit. We held our ceremony outside of the butterfly house, allowing guests to tour the butterfly house (and take a train ride) during cocktail hour, and we had our reception in the Aerospace exhibit. We kept calling our wedding “an Introvert’s dream wedding” because of all the activities. What we didn’t realize was that all the activities gave people things to talk about the whole night through. So many of our wedding guests have raved about our wedding being the most fun wedding they’ve been to, and a great deal of that was due to how much fun the Museum of Life and Science is! On the admin side, the Museum’s event coordinator, Rachel, was very friendly, positive, responsive, and accommodating. She helped a great deal with coordinating the set up of everything for our wedding in collaboration with our wedding planner, Events by Emily. Originally, we had been worried that having to start our wedding after the Museum closed at 5pm (ceremony at 6:30pm) would not be enough time, but all things considered, the limited amount of time did not outweigh how amazing and unique our wedding was because of the Museum. Without a doubt, if we were to plan our wedding again, we would absolutely book the Museum of Life and Science! (Photography: Laura Memory Photography; Wedding Planner: Events by Emily)

The venue was beautiful and the event staff were amazing! I am so glad we chose this venue and we would recommend it to everyone! That being said, it is an unusual venue and did have some quirks. The aquarium is very upfront about their rules and restrictions. They give you all important information before you sign a contract. The aquarium does not allow hard liquor - beer and wine only. This actually turned out to be a positive for us as open beer/wine bar is much more affordable than full bar. Due to normal operating hours, time to set up for the wedding is very short. Almost all of my vendors required extra staff to pull off setup and breakdown in the required time frame. The lighting is also a bit of a challenge. I only looked at photographers who had shot at the venue before - and I'm glad I did. Again, not the easiest venue, but soooo worth it!

We choose the Durham Arts Council for our New Years Eve wedding and could not have been happier! The venue is not only beautiful, but was also an excellent value. The space is open and airy and we were given the freedom to do as much or as little with it as we wanted. Fay, our point person at the venue was lovely, responsive and super easy to work with. She put us at ease and made the experience really great. We had our ceremony in the downstairs Atrium and the dinner in the upstairs gallery (the art on the walls was a added backdrop bonus to our photos). During dinner the downstairs was flipped to create the dance floor for the reception. Our guests could not stop talking about how beautiful the wedding was! We walked away a very happy married couple.
