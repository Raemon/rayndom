The wedding venue that made my friends jealous

The beauty of the Gardens exceeded our expectations and was by far the most magical experience for our special day. We held our ceremony in front of the banyan tree during sunset and I can't express how unreal the Gardens looked. There were butterflies fluttering all around, rays of sunlight passing through the palms, tiny bunches of orchids blooming, and brilliant varieties of green everywhere. Seriously ridiculous, the type of stuff Disney movies are inspired by. Our guests were in disbelief that such a magical place existed in the middle of Miami beach. The day wouldn't have come together without the guidance, hands on help and fresh spontaneous ideas of the garden Events & Programming Manager Maurice Jackson. This man is the absolute best!!!!! He doesn't miss a beat, and when you need that boost of confidence for a "crazy idea", he helps you make it real within reason. The Gardens were very clean and a perfect size for our 100 guests to roam around freely and safely while still being able to hear the music playing on the dance floor while also having multiple bars within reach scattered about the grounds. It's also beautifully lit at night so minimal lights are needed, leaving room for fun lighting decor. Lastly, we chose the premium liquor package and received zero complaints from guests. We would 10/10 recommend the Gardens for your event or wedding! Communication is stellar and they make your day all about you. We will cherish the Gardens through our pictures forever.   
  
One last bit of advice, if you're having a late night wedding, add the 40/100 clear tent in the great lawn to bring it all together. Guests were able to still enjoy the Gardens while eating dinner with no threats of rain to worry about.   
  
Love,  
The Gillettes

No Place I'd Rather Be

What's more romantic than a garden wedding in the spring? The Miami Beach Botanical Garden was the perfect venue for us (my *husband* and I--can't stop saying it!). We don't live in Miami anymore and booked this venue from only seeing photos and somewhat successful FaceTime call with Maurice--the Events Director Extraordinaire. He was so confident that our day would be so beautiful that we believed every word. We got married during Ultra Music Festival weekend and spring break but the location of the garden was almost secluded, and we were in our own fantasy world living out the fairytale dream. It was honestly the perfect day not only because of the setting but everything leading up captured everything we could've hoped for.

The Most Beautiful Venue 

We were so happy to have our wedding at Miami Beach Botanical Garden! From the start, Maurice was so responsive and helpful in every aspect of our wedding day. With his vendor recommendations, we were able to build an incredible team to help make our vision of our wedding day truly become a reality. The day honestly turned out better than we could have even imagined. So many people came up to us and comment on how beautiful the venue was!  
  
Maurice answered so many emails so promptly and was so flexible when we changed the date due to a covid delay. We are so happy we chose such a beautiful venue enhanced by an amazing coordinator!

A magical setting and great team

My husband and I were so glad that we went with the Miami Beach Botanical Garden. It is an exquisite little oasis in the midst of the spectacle of Miami Beach. The team is exceptionally helpful. Here are a few things that we really loved about it:  
  
1) Beautiful setting: The garden itself is so lovely that we built a lot of our design ideas around just complementing the natural beauty of the surroundings. Being quite small, it feels very intimate.  
  
2) Great location: Because it is located right near the main strip of South Beach, it was very convenient for guests to book nearby hotels – many of them could and did walk to the venue – while still being able to do other fun things and make a weekend of it. This is a major advantage over other lovely venues like the Fairchild botanical gardens.  
  
3) Extraordinary team: Maurice Jackson leads the events team at MBBG, and he goes above and beyond to make your wedding the event of your dreams. He was extremely communicative and would always work enthusiastically with us on how best to realize our desires. I cannot recommend the entire team highly enough as partners in making your wedding amazing.

Stunning Venue

Perhaps the most stunning venue for a perfect wedding. The garden is magnificent as is the entire Garden staff. Sandy is a pleasure to work with, warm, welcoming and professional in every way. Maurice coordinated such a fabulous event, from early on, recommending the best vendors and just having such a great handle on every aspect of the event. With rain threatening, he had plans A, B and C ready to go at a minute’s notice, and that he and his staff did so perfectly and so calmly. The wedding went off without a hitch, having their ceremony under the beautiful Banyan tree (in spite of the impending storms). They all helped to make the wedding a dream come true for our son and his new bride.

Most Phenomenal Venue All Around!

The Botanical Gardens served as such a gorgeous and classy backdrop for our event. A Special Thanks to the expertise and hard work of Maurice Jackson. He was the winning piece that truly elevated the event to an unforgettable experience. From the bar service, to the catering and to the final setup it was all so professionally done it exceeded my whole family’s expectations. Five Stars! Would definitely recommend!

Miami Beach Botanical Gardens is PERFECT for your small wedding

We decided to get married and wanted to have a very small wedding with under 10 people. We planned our wedding in a matter of days. We knew we wanted an outdoor venue with a tropical vibe - looked at many places, but the Miami Beach Botanical Gardens was perfect for our size and budget. We were able to book it for the day we wanted and the time we wanted only days ahead of the event. We held our ceremony in the Japanese Gardens - the pictures are fabulous, the scenery was intimate and relaxing. The best part of the experience was Maurice - he made it so easy for us, no pressure, no hassles, super helpful. If we could give him 10 stars it still wouldn't be enough. On the day of the wedding he was present and provided the little bits of help you need when you're pulling something together at the last minute. We highly recommend you consider the MBBG if you are considering a wedding in the Miami Beach area.

Stunning venue, professional, kind

My husband and I fell in love with this beautiful space immediately in our venue search. The initial booking process was seamless. We then had to push our initial wedding date due to COVID, and the team at MBBG was so accommodating. On the day of our wedding, there was a downpour and we had to pivot our original plans again for rain. The Garden has so many amazing spaces, so we were able to easily change our ceremony space for this. Maurice and the team were ready with suggestions for this change immediately without delay and were able to implement this effortlessly. We could not have dreamed for a more beautiful day which came to be due to MBBG team and beautiful space that they pour themselves into curating and maintaining all year long.

Maurice and the garden are absolutely incredible

Booking with Miami Beach Botanical Garden and Maurice was hands down THE best decision we ever could have made for our wedding day.   
  
We were a destination couple, and it took us nearly 6 months to find our venue. It felt like we researched every single wedding venue in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach before we found “the one.” But I knew within moments of calling the garden and talking to Maurice that we’d found our place. Some venues were unwilling to give us a FaceTime tour from afar, but within an hour of talking to Maurice, he’d gone around the garden to record a video tour to text us. In the video, I could literally see dozens of butterflies flying around the garden. It was like something out of a dream!  
  
We loved that the garden was like a blank canvas—lots of natural beauty from the plants and flowers, but the freedom to book the vendors we wanted, bring in whatever chair rentals and decorations defined our style, etc. Maurice gave us lots of recommendations for vendors, which we mixed with a few of our own picks.  
  
We booked the whole garden for our wedding, which gave us plenty of distinct, separate spaces to hold our ceremony, dinner, dance floor and our New Orleans-style second line parade. Plus there were a million different gorgeous backdrops for photos!  
  
A few months before our wedding, we found out that there was going to be a huge event across the street from the garden. It meant parking was going to be a nightmare and a lot of logistical challenges. This might have been reason to panic, but Maurice calmly offered support and advice, including adjusting our wedding timeline to give people extra time to find parking. On the day of our wedding, he personally fielded phone calls to help some of our most important guests, such as my grandmother (who was in a wheelchair and couldn’t walk far) get inside the venue in time for photos. He also went above and beyond offering advice and assistance with our decor choices. He worked hand in hand with our day-of coordinator to touch base with our vendors prior to our wedding.  
  
We felt the luckiest to have found the garden, and we couldn’t have imagined any place place more perfect for our wedding day. We also don’t think anyone else could have guided us through our wedding day like Maurice did. Our wedding was truly the best day of our lives, and so much of that is because of the garden and Maurice. We will never forget all he did for us, and the garden will be always be a sacred, special place for us, as long as we live.

Rays Of Light has illuminated this tropical oasis of a venue several times in the last year or so. The garden is perfect for any size wedding big or small. Outdoors or indoors, But outdoor photos are a must before your wedding ceremony.This venue is also the best deal in South Beach . I have heard this time again. And never have I seen a more dedicated man than Maurice Jackson who helps in so many ways with all of your venue needs . Even on the evening of your event, he personally stays until the very end and insures that everything goes off without a hitch. Most day of planners do not even do that! I fully indorse this venue and I always recommend this venue to all of my clients and friends looking for a beautiful place to get married in South Beach. Book early because this place is starting to get very popular. But having said this . The Botaincal Garden allows only one wedding reception per evening. So the place is yours!
