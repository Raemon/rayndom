Murchie Music Services played for my sister's wedding, and as one who was also heavily involved in the planning, I can honestly say that they blew me away with their professionalism and skill. Punctuality was never an issue, nor was preparation or musical skill. With their wide breadth of experience with classical, pop, and so many other genres of music, we were able to put together a beautiful and tasteful wedding service, as well as a reception that featured many songs from the bride and groom's childhoods, making it particularly personal and memorable. On a day when every detail and timing matters, and when the stress to get it right is so high, it was truly a relief to know that the musicians were not something we needed to worry about in the least. In fact, they knew exactly how to anticipate transitions quietly and unobtrusively, which helped us avoid some awkward silent moments while waiting for the bride and groom to arrive to the reception, for example. I'm so glad we went with Murchie Music Services and would recommend them to anyone planning a wedding, a funeral, or anything in between!

Very professional and organized. Great communication. Walked though the selections ahead of event and played samples. A very skilled musician and vocalist indeed!

The pastor, organist, and staff at House of Prayer ELCA were easy to work with and helpful. We were glad to be able to incorporate so spiritually meaningful elements into our wedding ceremony.

My wife and I hired Chris to play at our wedding. We had heard him play at local recitals and knew right away that his style and talent would be perfect for our wedding. We were extremely impressed with Chris's professional attitude. He really listened to what we wanted. He was willing to learn new music for our ceremony and also had some great ideas that he contributed based on his previous wedding experience. Chris provided his own equipment and was set up and ready well before the service. We had an outdoor wedding and rain was in the forecast, but he came prepared. He assured us that rain or shine he would be ready to play. The wedding went off without a hitch thanks to his thoughtful preparation. We received several compliments on his skill and ability, but people were also impressed that he stuck around to mingle. We would recommend him to anyone interested in live music, not just for a wedding, but any formal event. His skills are so diverse that he can adapt to any setting.
