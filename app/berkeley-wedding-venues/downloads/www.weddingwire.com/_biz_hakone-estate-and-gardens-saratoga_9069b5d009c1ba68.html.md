A million stars for Hakone!

We are so grateful to Hakone Estate & Gardens, and most especially to Tony and Melia, for hosting our wedding this December! By the end of the initial tour months ago, my now-husband had a very strong feeling that, "This is it, this is the place", and he was right; we couldn't have had a more magical wedding day.  
Tony was amazing through multiple site visits and the planning process, coordinating seamlessly with our wedding planner and helping us understand how to enjoy the property while also preserving the precious and authentic Japanese environment. Tony is a master event planner and contributed great ideas and finishing touches. The day of, amidst a blustery wet storm, we were blessed with a window of surreal sunshine and beautiful blue skys that appeared five minutes before our ceremony started and lasted just long enough to conduct our ceremony on the bridge and through to our reception in the Cultural Center and it's patio overlooking Silicon Valley. Tony and Melia worked seamlessly behind the scenes, ushering guests underneath tents and wiping down wet chairs so that, just as the sun burst out, we were able to have the most magical morning, exchanging our vows in the bright sun with rainwater still dripping from the stately and solemn trees around us. We feel so blessed to have been able to be married in this very special environment, and we will forever have warm feelings for Hakone and the team of amazing humans that supported us on our special day. Thank you Tony, Melia and Hakone!

Beautiful Ceremony Venue!

We hosted our October 2023 Wedding Ceremony at Hakone and we were so happy with the beautiful gardens and overall experience.   
  
The staff at Hakone (Tony and Melia) were extremely helpful, friendly, and easy to work with and they went above and beyond to make sure our rehearsal and ceremony went smoothly. We requested a unique setup with two aisles and we had a large decoration to attach to an arch we rented through a vendor, and they worked with both us and our vendors to make sure that everything was set up just right with plenty of time to spare. They also helped us work through all the important details of the ceremony without being overwhelming, and they did a perfect job executing on the actual ceremony, queuing our party to walk and managing the music and sound system.  
  
The garden itself is beautiful in any season. We visited multiple times throughout the year leading up to our wedding and enjoyed different plants in bloom every time. In October, the garden was still lush and green with redwoods, bamboo, and the Koi pond providing amazing variety. Our guests had a great time strolling through the gardens before and after the ceremony, and there were tons of amazing backdrops for our wedding photos. They even gave us a complimentary year-long membership following our wedding so we could come back to relive the memories!  
  
In summary, we highly recommend Hakone whether for a wedding ceremony or just a visit!

Beautiful venue & a perfect wedding!

We had our wedding here and could not have asked for a more perfect venue. The wisteria were blooming in April and we had the entire garden to ourselves. We were told by multiple people that it was the most beautiful wedding and venue they had been to. Tony & Melia worked with us every step of the way to ensure it was a perfect day and it definitely was! Plus we now have a year membership to the garden to visit and enjoy the place in which we made such special memories. :)

Last minute change to this venue due to evacuation from the CZU fires and temporary closure of our original venue. Wedding was Zoomed due to COVID..

Beautiful gardens and excellent bridal room. Choices of places on the premises to have the ceremony and plenty of gorgeous photo locations. A lot of time allotted for set up and clean up and private time in the gardens. Was the perfect COVID wedding.

Beautiful everything 

Tony and Christina were very professional and accommodating to what we wanted and needed. We got married on November 23rd and we were able to take advantage of the off peak price. But the normal price for a morning wedding on a moon bridge was pretty reasonable too. The gardens are beautiful and you get set up in the houses on the estate as your bride and groom quarters for set up. A sign is outside stating that you are getting married. You and your guests have the grounds to yourselves for three hours. Then it opens to the public at 11 and you have one more hour to enjoy the gardens. It was a beautiful experience.

Picture-esque wedding venue

I highly recommend this venue! It's so beautiful and literally every spot is a perfect picture. My family and friends were all amazed and dazzled by the beauty of this Japanese garden. Also, Tony was amazing to work with. He was patient, kind, and really understanding. He knows exactly how weddings normally run and he can help with any questions you might have. Overall, I recommend it!!

Hakone Gardens was where my husband and I started dating. We thought what better place to get married at than the exact location our relationship became official. We held our wedding ceremony at Hakone this past November 2015. It was perfect for our 60 guests. Tony, the event coordinator, was great. He helped make our ceremony run smoothly. This location is truly a hidden gem of the South Bay. Our guests felt as if our ceremony was a destination wedding. It will feel as if you are actually in Hakone, Japan.

If you're thinking of having this be your venue for your reception, I highly recommend you follow through. We met with them ~10 months before our reception, and from that first meeting until our last email and the day-of everything was perfect. Yes, PERFECT!!!! They are very professional which is shown by their responsiveness in their email, and with the clarity of their contract. They also did not talk us down, something I feared as it is quite the nice venue, which I appreciated. They didn't find it was odd that our reception was about half a year following our actual marriage ceremony nor did they mind working with us to use a halal catering company, something that was off the list.   
  
Flexibility? I changed my mind on some decorations the month of and they were able to accommodate. Paying with X on one card and Y on another card? They can do it. Meeting with your catering company? They do this too, and this is something I didn't think of at all so I'm glad they did.   
  
Now for value... this is the true reason why they deserve 5 stars. It's an estate. A full estate that you're renting out for hours, and it's only for you and your guests plus vendors. I got a big building for everyone to eat in, a bamboo forest, a koi pond, and wonderful backdrops all over. My bridal suite was actually a small traditional Japanese building. My bridesmaid didn't have to fit into one small room, they got a huge area with sliding paper doors to dress up in. If they stepped into the hallway they'd see a rock garden. Oh, and the rock garden area had been renovated from the time I signed the contract to when my reception took place. You don't just get awesome, you get even more awesome as they seem to be continuing working on improving the gardens et all.   
  
Seriously the worst part of our wedding was having to go home... I wish we could have spent like 5 more hours chilling there with our guests. So stress-free. I can't wait to go back there, if only we didn't live so far from them.

I searched high and low from San Diego all the way to Sacramento for my wedding location. I live in Los Angeles and had a plethora of beautiful choices for my ceremony, but when I came across Hakone Gardens, I KNEW it would be THE PLACE for my ceremony. Kyongmi, the event coordinator at the Gardens was more than helpful. She was extremely knowledgable, warm, thoughtful, and made me actually feel like a "real person" and not just another bride. She took the time to chat with me about my family, our cultural values, and the things we'd be incorporating into my wedding ceremony that reflected my heritage and my fiance's heritage. She answered every single email from me (and there were a LOT) promptly and efficiently. The Gardens themselves were absolutely breathtaking! I visited Hakone Gardens in the springtime when everything was in full bloom, and I was worried it wouldn't be as beautiful in the winter (when my ceremony took place). I was completely blown away by all the colors of the foliage. Even though there weren't any flower blossoms, the colors of the fall leaves were absolutely amazing!!!!!! I HIGHLY recommend Hakone Gardens! All my guests absolutely LOVED it!
