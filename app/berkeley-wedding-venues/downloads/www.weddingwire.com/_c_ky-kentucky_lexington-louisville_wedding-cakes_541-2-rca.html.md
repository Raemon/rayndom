## How much does a wedding cake cost?

Having a wedding cake at your reception is one of the biggest (and sweetest!) traditions. But what does a wedding cake cost? While wedding cake prices do vary depending on the size and style of your cake, the average cost of a wedding cake in the U.S. is around $500 with most couples spending between $300 to $700. While this may sound like a lot for a dessert, you’d be surprised as to how much work goes into creating a gorgeous wedding cake.

  * __ $ 177 or less Lower range
  * __ $ 450  Average cost
  * __ $ 350 - $ 600  Most couples spend between
  * __ $ 850 or more Upper range



Costs displayed are based on spend from thousands of couples who recently reported pricing for this service within their WeddingWire review. Pricing varies based on factors including, but not limited to, vendor’s experience, level of expertise, event guest count, date, and geographic region.

Which factors impact wedding cake prices?

__

Not surprisingly, the bigger and more elaborate a wedding cake is, the higher the cost of a wedding cake will be. A wedding cake featuring lots of design elements, including sugar flowers, fondant details, many tiers, and unique shapes, will cost more than a simpler cake with classic buttercream icing, a few fresh flowers, and fewer tiers. While your flavor choice likely won’t have an impact on your wedding cake’s price, requesting certain custom flavors may raise your wedding cake cost a bit. 

What is the starting price of a wedding cake?

__

The starting price of a wedding cake can vary depending on the type of frosting you prefer. Cakes covered in fondant, a sugary paste-like icing, tend to cost more than cakes covered in buttercream (frosting made from butter and sugar). Fondant is more durable than buttercream (and it [won’t melt in the summertime](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-expert-tips-to-avoid-a-summer-wedding-cake-meltdown)!), but it’s generally thought of as less tasty. The starting price of a fondant wedding cake is usually about $5 per slice, while the starting price of a buttercream wedding cake is about $4 per slice. Again, these wedding cake prices will vary even more based on decorations, size, etc. 

What’s included in the cost of a wedding cake?

__

This varies from cake baker to cake baker. Usually, the cost of your wedding cake will include the cake itself, a design consultation where your baker will create a custom design just for your wedding, [caketasting](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/everything-you-need-to-know-about-a-wedding-cake-tasting), delivery and set up. Some cake bakers will also include supplies like cake stands, [cake toppers](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/top-types-of-wedding-cake-toppers), and cutting utensils, though you may have to provide these on your own. And some wedding cake prices include an [extra top tier of your wedding cake](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/how-to-preserve-your-wedding-cake) or anniversary cake for you and your spouse to enjoy on your first anniversary. 

What types of desserts do wedding cake bakers offer?

__

About 54 percent of couples choose to serve an additional wedding dessert, aside from or in addition to wedding cake, at their receptions. Cake bakers may offer a variety of these alternative wedding desserts, including [cupcakes](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/15-reasons-why-we-still-love-cupcakes), cake pops, cookies, pies, pastries, doughnuts, and more—the starting price for cupcakes is about $3 per cupcake. There are also groom’s cakes, which are a tradition particularly in the South. We’ve seen these [groom’s cakes](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/cakes-desserts--t23) shaped like everything from sports paraphernalia to burritos! 

When should I hire a wedding cake baker?

We recommend hiring a wedding cake baker at least six months before your wedding day—these vendors do tend to book up quickly! Start by [reading online reviews of wedding cake bakers near you](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-cakes), and selecting a few to interview (in person whenever possible). You’ll typically have a wedding cake tasting after you’ve booked your baker, where you’ll [select your cake’s flavors](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/favorite-flavor-combinations-from-real-cake-bakers).

We couldn’t have asked for a better wedding cake vendor! From the very first consultation to the final delivery, the entire process was seamless and enjoyable. Gloria was incredibly professional, attentive to our needs, and truly passionate about her craft. The cake itself was a masterpiece – not only was it visually stunning, but it also tasted divine. Each layer was perfectly moist and flavorful, and the design exceeded our expectations. Our guests couldn’t stop raving about how delicious it was! What stood out the most was Gloria's dedication to making our vision come to life. She listened to every detail we wanted and added her creative touch to make it even more special. Gloria's customer service was top-notch, always responsive and accommodating. If you’re looking for a wedding cake that will wow your guests and make your special day even more memorable, look no further. We highly recommend Gloria to anyone in need of a spectacular and absolutely delicious wedding cake!

Maggie and Sweets By Millie made a fantastic, phenomenal cake. Even guests who claimed to not like cake enjoyed the cake! We're glad we ordered an additional cake top for our anniversary, because the cake was gone by the end of the night! They were very professional and easy to work with.

The wedding cake was amazing! Not only was it above and beyond what we expected, but the experience was great as well. Plenty of options to choose from and she treats you like a friend and not like a customer. Thank you so much Sevda!!

Amy was so warm and welcoming when we came in for a tasting. She made us feel right at home. That, and the delicious cake we tried, drew us in! It was the right decision because I believe we got more compliments on the cake than anything else :) Amy's strawberry champagne cake is the way to go!
