David was a pleasure to work with from the beginning planning stages through to the day-of coordination. He is highly organized and professional, hearing our goals for the day and offering suggestions, song lists, and sound bites to help us decide. We loved his repertoire and received so many compliments from our guests on his playing and professionalism. He was on the spot during the ceremony with the microphones for our officiant and readers. We were so pleased to have David play at our wedding and to have the beautiful element of classical guitar for the pre ceremony, ceremony, and cocktail hour. It was just lovely and so perfect. We highly recommend David for any event.

My husband & I hired the Kelsh Trio to perform at our October 2012 wedding. Mary, the violinist and contact person, was very nice and easy to work with throughout the booking process. The music was beautiful, the pricing was reasonable, and I feel having live music for your ceremony adds a level of elegance. If you're considering musicians for your wedding, I definitely recommend the Kelsh Trio!

Our musician fell through shortly before our wedding and we were able to hire Steve on short notice. He was excellent to work with. He was very thorough and made sure to ask a lot of questions to make sure he could do all that we wanted to do. Steve listened to any questions and request we had. On the wedding day he setup quietly in the background and played flawlessly. We had many comments on the music, especially for the cocktail hour. He had quite a library of songs and played a great variety to please all different age groups. I highly recommend Steve.
