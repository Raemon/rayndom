We hosted a wedding at Club Los Meganos on 11/8/24. Katrina, Lily, and staff were very professional, collected, responsive, and helpful throughout this process. The venue offers many delicious food options and really puts your vision together. There are not enough words to say to recommend this venue as it is perfect to host a wedding of any size and any time of the year. Katrina was so calm and cheerful the day before and the day of that it helped me calm down and not stress. I enjoyed this venue as they have great recommended vendors and room for creativity, and it was great not to have to outsource everything. I highly recommend touring the venue and talking with the staff to see the vision come together and answer all your questions.

We just recently had our ceremony and reception here (11/7/10). It seemed like everytime we came here, called or emailed them, we received a response from a different person; however, everyone got back to us right away and knew what was going on with our wedding. The prices are what sold us (even though as soon as I saw this place I knew this was the one!). They first asked what our wedding budget was, and even though it wasn't a huge budget, they tried to work around what we had. Yes, we ended up spending way more than expected, but everything was so worth it! Allison and Elise were AMAZING!!! Super nice girls with so much knowledge and patience. Our officiant was Anthony Patterson who was super nice, professional but also funny. We met with him and instantly felt so comfortable. Unfortunately he couldn't make it to the rehearsal because of "an emergency" but Elise did a great job anyway! It did make us a little nervous about the wedding day but Anthony showed up (early) the day of. Aside from him not making it to the rehearsal, we couldn't have asked for anyone better to marry us. He made our guests laugh and we loved the way he spoke...his voice is very deep but clear. DJ Shawn Storm was incredible, he was able to mix in Latin music and English music very well without making it awkward. When I met him the day of the wedding, he was super nice and basically told me "I will play whatever you want whenever you want. You just let me know!" He definetly got the party started and played good music. The whole staff the day of our wedding were so great! There was a really sweet woman (forgot her name) who served us drinks, carried our plates to our table and made sure that we were all well taken care of. Unfortunately it RAINED the day we got married so we weren't able to get married outside by the gazebo and have the amazing view, BUT they did wait until the last minute (it stopped raining) and asked me what I wanted to do, so I gotta give them credit for that! Allison went as far as driving to the outside ceremony site (20 min before the ceremony) to check it out and let me know if it was possible to have it outside. We ended up having the ceremony inside (the banquet) which worked out perfectly! It was nice and cozy, the set up was really nice and they refunded us $1,300 because of that! (sweeeet!- Honeymoon money!!) We are so grateful for everyone at Wedgewood! Our wedding was AMAZING, it was everything I have ever wanted and more!

We had our wedding at this venue in June and it was an amazing experience! The venue offered both indoor and outdoor spaces, which were perfect for our celebration. Despite the heat, everything went smoothly. Patricia the event manager was incredible and made sure everything was perfect. Highly recommend this venue!
