Flawless Service, Exceptional Experience!

We hired Bartenders Plus for our event, and they absolutely crushed it! From the first consultation to the final pour, their team was professional, polished, and genuinely fun to work with. Our guests couldn’t stop raving about the signature cocktails and how seamless the bar service was throughout the night.  
  
The bartenders were not only skilled but brought an incredible energy that elevated the entire vibe. Everything ran like clockwork—setup, service, cleanup—zero stress on our end. It honestly felt like they were an extension of our team.  
  
If you’re looking for bartenders who know how to keep the drinks flowing and the party going—without ever missing a beat—Bartenders Plus is it. Highly recommend. Will 100% book again!

We used bartenders plus for our wedding last month and the team went above and beyond. Very professional, excellent at keeping lines as short as possible, incredible customer service and creative delicious drinks that guests will be talking about long after the event.

Amazing Service! 

Our wedding day was made even more special by the presence of our wonderful bartender, Rodney. From the first cocktail to the final toast, he provided top-notch service with a smile that lit up the room. Rodney wasn't just a bartender – he was a true professional who went above and beyond to ensure that our guests had an unforgettable experience. Beyond his skills behind the bar, Rodney brought a genuine warmth and enthusiasm to the occasion that was infectious. He greeted each guest with kindness and hospitality, making everyone feel welcome and appreciated.  
What truly stood out about Rodney was his genuine gratitude for being a part of our special day. His humility and sincerity were evident in every interaction, and it was clear that he took great pride in his work and genuinely enjoyed being a part of our celebration.Thank you for helping to make our wedding day unforgettable!

Nothing short of amazing…

From the first call with Jake, I knew I was booking with Bartenders Plus. They are kind, personable, reliable, and always get back with you quickly with questions and are super super thorough. They make sure you leave with clarity and are comfortable for your big day. We were blessed with our bartender, Ashley C who was nothing short of amazing and super sweet. She arrived on time, took great care of my family and friends. Thank you Jake, Jennifer, and Ashley for helping bring our day to fruition!

Exactly what I needed

Working with Bartenders Plus was a breeze! I interviewed a number of bartenders, and many of them were less than professional. Bartender's plus was professional, they quoted only what I needed, and their prices were fair. Also, the staff members who worked our event were lovely.

Highly Recommend

Bartenders Plus was a lifesaver for a wedding!!  
We had to make last minute changes with previously booked bartenders from our caterer and Jake was happy to help us out.  
Communication was quick and easy which eased the stress of having to make changes the week of our wedding.  
At our wedding, Bartenders Plus staff were both very professional and extremely positive! Our guests' glasses were always full and they enjoyed every drink that was served. We cannot thank Bartenders Plus enough for saving the day and highly recommend using them at your next event!
