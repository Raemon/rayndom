Our experience was wonderful. From the very beginning, the officiant was always willing to help us, maintaining constant, clear, and very personal communication. She took the time to answer all of our questions, listen to our ideas, and make all the changes we requested so that the ceremony would truly reflect us. Her support and professionalism gave us great peace of mind throughout the entire process. She was undoubtedly a key factor in making our day so special and meaningful. We recommend her without hesitation.

Can't say enough about Pastor Paul! He put us instantly at ease with his playful sense of humor and his obvious love for his job. And that rich, resonant theatrical voice! Made quite the impression at our wedding. He's a showman, but he's also a good listener who took the time learn our story and craft a ceremony that was just right for us. And that made the magic even stronger. We highly recommend him!

I couldn’t recommend Two Hearts, One Life Ministries enough! We were looking for a bilingual pastor to officiate our wedding and Rev. Julian was exceptional. He sent our entire wedding ceremony outline (with specific Spanish and English sections) so that we knew EXACTLY how our ceremony would flow! Rev. Julian and his wife are the best.

We were so excited that Rabi David and Cantor Lee were able to perform our wedding ceremony at the Grand Floridian in Disney World. I remember when I was 15 how they made me feel so accepted within the congregation and how that brought me closer to Judaism. Rabi David even remembered things I told him about, like my dance training, all these years later. So having them wed myself and my now husband was so special. From start to finish the ceremony was loving, warm, beautiful, full of magic, and felt so tailored to us as a couple. Myself and my husband can truly say the ceremony was actually our favorite and most cherished part and the wedding and that was in large part to Rabi David and Cantor Lee 🤍

Pastor Mike did an incredible job officiating our beach wedding, and we couldn’t be happier with the experience. His words were heartfelt, warm, and perfectly matched the setting, making the ceremony feel personal and meaningful. He brought a calm, joyful presence that helped make the day even more special. We truly appreciated the care he put into every detail, and our guests loved him as well. We were extremely pleased and highly recommend Pastor Mike to any couple.

The Reverend Elizabeth McGlinn made our celebration of love perfect. Her meticulous planning ensured that we were actively involved in all the aspects of the service. She respects and values input, making suggestions to enhance such a memorious occasion. She blessed the celebration of our love not only with a beautifully presented service but also with her genuine smile but also very twinkling eyes! She expressed happiness and joy as we made our marriage vows. She really made our special day a special day!
