Harmony Cafe exceeded our expectations! David was our caterer at the day of our wedding. He came in early, had all of his equipment and food ready to go or to be prepared later. The only thing we had to provide was the refrigerator. We were impressed by how well organized was the setup. We asked for a buffet style (to save money on servers). All of the food was easily accessible and guests were able to go through the line quickly. The food itself was amazing. Everything was very delicious and we even had a few leftovers to enjoy later! Our meal was a combination of home and restaurant style food. David made sure to ask us questions and prepared exactly what we wanted! All of the guests and us were more than satisfied. Highly recommend this caterer!!

Christine and Navarre are our favorite wedding vendors! Christine is communicative and details every decision timeline (e.g., tastings, cutlery, linens, final meal decisions). Navarre’s food is absolutely fantastic! We had multiple people approach us the days and weeks after our wedding to compliment the food. We truly cannot recommend a better caterer for the event. We had several guests with severe allergies, and the Navarre team ensured all their meals were perfect. Thank you, Christine, and the Navarre team for all of your efforts!

As the couple getting married they knew that we were so busy and indy fresh went out of their way to make sure we got to eat our food and enjoy it! They also went above and beyond with making our favorite pizza togo for us to have a late night snack! We could not have asked for any better service!!! I beyond recommend them!!!

They catered our wedding reception dinner and dessert and were fantastic. They were friendly and easy to work with. The food was great! We took advantage of the tasting which helped us decide quite a bit. We did take a chance on some items that we didn’t try at the tasting, and they were amazing too. We had a few people with dietary restrictions, but our coordinator Cerissa was helpful in making sure we had options for them. The staff the day of the event was great bringing the food to those guests while everyone else went up to the buffet. A lot of our guests mentioned how delicious the food was.

I cannot say enough wonderful things about Sweet and Savory Catering! From day one they were absolutely incredible to work with in every way. They were thorough, professional, hard working and communicative all throughout the process. The food was absolutely incredible and an amazing part of our wedding day! We have received so many compliments on the incredible food from cocktail hour, to dinner and our late night snack (the popcorn bar!). It was all amazing, down to the smallest detail. I want to especially call out their detailed care for our guests with allergies/dietary restrictions - including myself as the bride needing things gluten free. They provided specialized information regarding the dietary restrictions of all the items throughout the day, which we communicated to our guests, and they were easily able to navigate throughout all the food items. They were efficient and thorough with set-up/tear down, placement of linens/plates/utensils and caring for the tables throughout the night. All the staff was wonderful to work with - kind, attentive and helpful. Leading up to the wedding we had an initial meeting (before booking) and our individual tasting session - in each meeting they took their time to work with us as much as needed, guide us in the process, and have thorough conversation to ensure all our wishes were met. It gave me such peace of mind to know all would be taken care of - and it was even better than I could have imagined! Across many, many communications for every detail over phone and email, they were prompt and helpful. Thank you Sweet and Savory Catering!

We cannot speak more highly about the experience that we had with Kahn's for our wedding in February. From the planning to the food to the service, it was truly above and beyond anything we could have even imagined. Leading up to our big day, we had multiple calls and emails with Steven and the Kahn's team to make sure we were all on the same page about the food and drink throughout the evening. What could have felt like somewhat tedious interactions were so thoughtful and well-managed, where we felt like they really wanted to get to know us personally so that they could help make sure our day was the best. On our wedding day, the day-off coordinator from the venue was unable to attend due to a conflict, so Steven and Jenny from Kahn's actually stepped in to play that role on top of everything they were doing for the catering! They went out of their way to attend our rehearsal the evening before so they knew how they could help and then day of they were our go-to people! Steven even was the one who fixed the train of my dress before heading down the aisle - this is the coordinator of the caterer that we're talking about who did this!!! Kahn's handled all the tables, chairs, linens, place settings, etc. and everything looked absolutely stunning in the venue. While we picked fairly straightforward options, during the tasting event you can see everything they have and it's crazy how many options they have for everything! I'm sure they could accomodate whatever your vision is! The food itself was fantastic. So many guests told us that night or in the weeks since that it was the best meal they've ever had at a wedding. We had an amazing, fresh salad with a huge piece of brie and pear; then a duo for dinner of beef short rib, and a white balsamic-marinated chicken alongside garlic mashed potatoes and carrots/green beans. The cocktail hour hors d'oeuvres were also amazing and they even let us swap out a few of the hors d'oeuvres that would have come with our package for a charcturie table which was a huge hit. The package we chose came with the highest bar tier so there were so many options - really something for everyone! The service was top-notch throughout the night with a ton of staff on-hand that really made the meal go quickly and smoothly. They were exremely attentive, helpful, and professional - it felt like we were being served at the top restaurant in the city and when you're serving a room of 125 people at the same time, that is not easy to do! You will not be disappointed if you choose Kahn's for your wedding or event - they were a real highlight of our day! Thank you so much to Steven and the whole Kahn's team for everything they did!

LaSalle catering did an absolutely wonderful job catering our wedding. They were incredibly flexible and committed to making our menu perfect and catered to us. It was amazing the quality of food given our venue was in a tent outdoors. I got many compliments from our guests. Also, we got married in the summer and it was very hot. Days before, we asked LaSalle if we could provide popsicles for our ceremony, and they made it happen! Couldn't have asked for a better catering experience!
