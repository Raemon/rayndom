Beautiful flowers!

We loved our wedding florals from Flower Divas! The team was very friendly and made the process of deciding what we wanted very easy, despite the fact we didn't have a lot of wedding experience. On the day of the wedding, we were blown away by how beautiful our arch was and appreciated the beautiful florals at each of the tables for our reception. Thank you Flower Divas!

Gorgeous flowers!

We were so happy with our wedding flowers! Shawna and her team put together beautiful bouquets, flowers for the arch, and greenery that we added to the seating chart board. She provided flowers for the cake the day before. Shawna delivered them on time and many guests commented on how gorgeous all of the flowers were. The photos speak for themselves!

You won't be disappointed! 

Flower Divas went above and beyond for our wedding. When first meeting with Shawna, I had a very vague idea of style and color. After her showing her just a couple of pictures, she quickly understood my vision and helped to suggest different elements of decoration and design that I had not thought about. The day of, they were efficient, professional, and the finished product of our ceremony room and reception was breathtaking!! Beyond what I had imagined. I would not hesitate to work with Shawna at Flower Divas again for any future events!

From my first consultation with Shauna I was completely confident she understood my vision for the wedding and would create beautiful arrangements. Still, the day of the wedding I was completely blown away. The arrangements that were created were absolutely perfect and made the entire venue look absolutely magical. Shauna was easy to communicate with and not once did I feel pressured to purchase anything. The staff there the day of stayed longer than I thought they would to ensure everything was perfect and went above and beyond for us. They came with multiple options for corsages and boutonnieres for the wedding party and parents and even pulled some extra flowers to decorate the cake with. They were kind and patient and made my life so much easier. Highly recommend!

Shawna was fantastic! We didn't have a very clear vision of what we wanted before we met with her but after hearing her ideas and suggestions we were sold. The flowers for the venue were incredible and I was absolutely in love with the bridal bouquet she created.

Shawna and her team were perfect! The flowers absolutely beautiful. She did such an amazing job at our wedding. Words cannot describe how amazing the flowers were and how professional she was throughout the entire process. Providing samples, guidance, and telling us what she thought would be best. That is what makes a perfect vendor. Not everything we picked out would have fit the style...she helped us make the right decisions. Thanks again Shawna!!!

Shawna took the vision we had for our wedding and delivered exactly what we wanted and more for our destination wedding held at the Clift Hotel in San Francisco on June 6, 2015. Planning a destination wedding can be difficult from so far away (Atlanta, GA) but Shawna made it easy! Walking into the ceremony and reception and seeing everything exactly how we envisioned was a dream come true...thank you Shawna!!
