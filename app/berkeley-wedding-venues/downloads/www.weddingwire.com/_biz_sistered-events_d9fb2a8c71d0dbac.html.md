Couldn't be happier!

Samantha was incredible to work with. She was organized, thoughtful, and inquisitive. She wanted to know what was important to us on our special day and coordinated everything to ensure it all went to plan. We really loved that she took over communications with our other vendors in the month leading up to the wedding, it was a huge weight off our shoulders. Her centralized timeline for the weekend that she made and distributed helped ensure everyone had the information they needed and was at the right place at the right time. At our rehearsal dinner, we somehow managed to forget a wine opener - Samantha jumped into action and went to the nearest store to grab one, saving the day. She also helped us redo our whole photography plan after finding out that there was protest that was planned to overlap with one of our photo locations. Samantha was overall a pleasure to work with and was instrumental in making our day perfect!

Forever Grateful for our Unforgettable Day

Hiring Samantha was hands down one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. She gave me the greatest gift of all: the ability to be fully present and enjoy every single moment of the day. That’s not something that comes easily to me, and I’ll always be grateful for how she made that possible.  
  
Her attention to detail was impeccable—nothing slipped through the cracks—and she consistently went above and beyond to advocate for me throughout the planning process. I always felt supported, heard, and in the best hands.  
  
Samantha brought calm, professionalism, and genuine care to every step of the journey. If you're considering working with her, do it. You'll be so glad you did.

Highly recommend!! You won’t regret having their help for your special day! 

We had the pleasure to have Heather as our wedding coordinator a few years ago. She was amazing!! She ensured everything was taken care and I didn’t have to worry about a thing. She handled an emergency situation flawlessly - making sure the guests didn’t know anything was going on. She was so fun to plan our perfect day with and I was so grateful we had her!! Would highly recommend!
