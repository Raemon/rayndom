What is included in the price of a bridal hair and makeup package?

__

In general, your wedding hair and makeup cost will include your stylist’s or makeup artist’s time on your wedding day. Most hair and makeup pros charge by the hour, so the longer you need your hair stylist and makeup artist to be present during your wedding, the more you’ll pay. Also know that for hair stylists, wedding updos tend to cost more than blowouts—in fact, the average cost of a bridal updo is $100 and the average cost of a simpler blowout is $55. When it comes to makeup, airbrush makeup typically comes with a higher price tag than traditional application. The average cost of airbrush makeup is $115 while the average cost of traditional makeup is $100. Some pros include a hair or makeup trial in their bridal makeup prices or wedding hair prices, but some do charge extra. 

How far in advance should I book my hair and makeup artist?

__

We recommend booking your wedding hair stylist and makeup artist at least three months before your wedding. Start by reading online reviews of beauty pros near your wedding location, and then reach out to a few to find out availability and pricing. You may want to interview several [wedding hair stylists](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-questions-to-ask-a-hair-stylist) and [makeup artists](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-questions-to-ask-a-wedding-makeup-artist) to find someone you’re comfortable with, and whose style and vision matches yours. 

Are there any add-on costs for wedding hair and makeup?

__

Depending on your style, needs, and budget, there are many different possible add-ons to bridal makeup packages or to your wedding hair cost. A few examples:

  * Extra services: There are certain makeup techniques and styles that might add dollars to your bridal makeup cost. For example, [false lashes may cost extra](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-eye-makeup-tips-from-the-pros), as can airbrush makeup. When [choosing your wedding-day makeup style](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/what-should-your-wedding-day-makeup-style-be), be sure to factor in these additional costs.
  * Travel: If your wedding hair and makeup pros work out of a salon, you may have to pay extra for them to travel to your wedding location. And if it’s an especially long distance, you may have to pay even more for mileage.
  * Additional people: If you’re planning on having your hair stylist or makeup artist also provide services to your bridesmaids, mom, etc., you’ll have to pay more. Your hair stylist or makeup artist may choose to bring an assistant to help speed things along on your wedding day—another add-on to your wedding makeup cost or wedding hair cost.
  * Additional hours/touch-ups: Want your hair stylist or makeup artist to be on hand at different times throughout your wedding day to provide touch-ups or even a new ‘do for your reception? The more time you have your beauty pros on hand, the more you’ll pay for your wedding hair and wedding makeup prices.
  * Trial: As mentioned, many wedding hair stylists and makeup artists charge extra for a trial run.
  * Tips: Many couples forget to [factor tips into their wedding-day budget](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/wedding-tipping-guide). We recommend tipping your hair stylist and makeup artist as though it was a regular appointment—15 to 20 percent of the total cost for each professional.



What are wedding hair and makeup trials? And how much do they cost?

__

A [wedding hair and/or makeup trial](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/10-questions-to-ask-a-wedding-makeup-artist) allows you to meet with your hair or beauty pro a few months before your wedding, and see how exactly your hair and makeup will look on your wedding day. You can also make any tweaks or adjustments if necessary. If your hair stylist or makeup artist charges extra for a trial, the average cost is $75 per service. 

How much does bridesmaid makeup cost?

__

It’s a good idea to have your bridesmaids’ makeup professionally done—they’ll feel more confident and look even better in photos! The average wedding makeup cost for bridesmaids is $75 per service.

Angelique and her team were absolutely amazing! From the moment I first connected with Angelique she was nothing short of attentive and professional. She would answer every single question I had and really took the time to understand what I wanted and my vision. The day of my wedding she and her team moved SO quickly! We had a group of 12 people and everyone looked amazing and like themselves but a little glam! Our wedding went till 9pm and I didn’t see anyone’s hair fall flat or make up smudge! It stayed all day long! I got so many compliments on my hair and makeup that day, I couldn’t have asked for a better Hair and MakeUp team!

I highly recommend working with Ella for hair and make up for any special event. She and her colleague Anita (whom I would also highly recommend) did the hair and make up for myself and the women folk of our wedding party. Ella is a pure artist and was able to create the exact look I was going for in a manner that was flattering for my unique beauty needs. She provided excellent guidance and worked hard to ensure that I felt beautiful on the wedding day. She also provided me with a detailed timeline to get hair and/or make up for 8 women in time to take pictures before the ceremony. She and Anita were able to keep to that timeline without rushing anyone's hair and make up. All of us looked so beautiful and the hair and makeup held for all the pictures and ceremony despite it being a super windy day.

I truly cannot put into words how grateful I am for Cherie! I stumbled upon her Instagram when I was in the looks for the perfect MUA for my wedding and could instantly feel her beautiful soul through her work. From the very first moment I attended my bridal trial, I knew instantly that she was the one. She truly listened to me, understood my vision, and made me feel so comfortable and confident — I left that trial knowing I was in the best hands. As soon as she arrived on my wedding day, she brought such a calming, kind, and positive energy that made the whole morning feel so special and stress-free. Cherie along with her assistants Leslie and Jaylyn were incredibly sweet, patient, and made every single one of us feel beautiful. Cherie’s kindness, warmth, and genuine care made one of the most important mornings of my life truly special from the very first moment. She has such a calming presence about her that while she was working her magic and we were chatting away she eased my pre wedding jitters. My makeup was everything I dreamed of and more — it was flawless, photographed beautifully, and lasted perfectly all night through happy tears, hugs, dancing, and everything in between. I received so many compliments throughout the entire day and night, which made me feel so confident and radiant on such an important day. My bridesmaids also looked absolutely stunning and couldn’t stop raving about how much they loved their makeup. Each one of them felt seen and cared for, which meant the world to me. Cherie didn’t just do makeup — she helped make my wedding day feel magical. I will forever be thankful for her and would recommend her a million times over to any bride looking for not only talent, but genuinely wonderful people. Thank you again to the amazing Cherie!!

We had the best experience with Samone! She did my three daughters’ hair—each with a completely different style—and every single one turned out amazing. From braids to curls to sleek ponytails, she nailed every look perfectly. She was patient, upbeat, and so great with the girls, making the whole experience fun and relaxed. You can tell she truly loves what she does and takes pride in her work. Highly recommend her to anyone looking for a talented stylist with a wonderful attitude!

Nadia is an amazing make up artist. When I reached out to her two weeks in advance for my city hall wedding, she promptly shared her reasonable pricing as well as asked follow up questions. She was flexible in meeting me rather than me meeting at her studio for an additional fee. She also provided her advise and recommendations when I was not as sure of what I'd like. When I gave her make up inspiration she would ask what I liked about the pictures and helped give me the soft natural glam look I was looking for. Attached are before and after pictures, so you can see she's done a great job evening out my skin tone, covering my blemishes, and helping me shine! Make up took about an 75 minutes and hair also took about that look. We took a 10 minute break in between. She also does take before and after photos and does a meticulous job with hair and make up. I also appreciated the touch up kit she provided after for lips, oiliness, or just some extra foundation. I highly recommend Mari Marry!

Kate was my makeup and hairstylist. I shared a few online references with her, and we discussed the best options based on my face shape. Kate was very punctual and arrived at my home on time. She was easy to communicate with, and scheduling the appointment was simple and smooth. I would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a professional and reliable makeup and hairstylist.

Amy was an absolute joy to work with. She was a recommendation from a friend, and when I initially reached out to her, she was professional, prompt, and even offered to do a phone call with me so we could get a feel for each other. I don’t typically wear much makeup and I’ve had… mediocre experiences with wedding makeup in the past as part of the bridal party. I voiced these concerns to Amy during my trial, and together we came up with a game plan for a look that made me feel gorgeous while still looking like me. On the Big Day, Amy and her second makeup artist were on-time and simply flew through all the bridesmaids. We were ahead of the timeline the whole morning, which helped start the day on a more relaxing note. I was thrilled with my final look; my hair and makeup lasted literally all night, except for the lip gloss (which is normal, and she provided a touch up for, which was perfect!). I truly can’t recommend Amy enough for future brides!
