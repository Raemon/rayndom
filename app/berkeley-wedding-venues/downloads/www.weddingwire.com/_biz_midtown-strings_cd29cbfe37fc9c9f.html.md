Wide Variety of Incredibly Talented Artists 

I love partnering with Natalie from Midtown Strings. Beyond being extremely talented herself, she's also connected to a lot of other awesome and talented artists in the city. We have partnered with her to bring a variety of different music genres to life for our events - violin + DJ, violin trio, folk band with vocalist, jazz trio, etc - and each one brought a huge WOW factor that our attendees loved! Natalie is always super responsive and willing to brainstorm awesome musical acts for any event I come to her with! She's my go to and I know when I work with her, the music will be on point. Absolutely recommend!

Wish I Could Leave 10 Stars!

If you're hesitant to book, I'm here to give you that extra nudge! ;) Midtown Strings were the perfect addition to our cocktail hour, adding that extra touch of elegance while still keeping the music fun and modern. The quartet played during cocktail hour, where guests started dancing + even requested a few songs, and then moved onto the dance floor of the ballroom while guests entered to be seated. Not only are they incredibly talented and professional, Natalie and team were super responsive and easy to work with!

Ceremony Music to Die For

Natalie and her team at Midtown Strings truly brought our ceremony to life. Natalie made the process shockingly easy; which, in wedding planning, is certainly saying something. :)

Wedding Ceremony & Reception - Five stars!!!

Natalie worked with us and our DJ to play violin for our wedding ceremony (prelude and processionals) and also for a segment during our party with the electric violin. She was amazing! Easy to work with and went above our expectations. The party had so much energy b/c of her segment. She immersed herself in the crowd and all of our guests got really into the party! Thank you Natalie!

A Refreshing Evening with Midtown Strings

If you are looking for professional musicians to transform your event from okay to Oh Yes!, definitely consider Midtown Strings! From the initial contact, this group was incredibly easy to work with. In addition to possessing excellent musical talent, these musicians were extremely professional. They arrived early, set up quickly, played at the perfect volume and tempo for our festive early evening gathering, smiled at the audience, and discretely left the venue at the end of their performance. Midtown Strings was the perfect musical accompaniment to our nonprofit fundraising event. I highly recommend them!
