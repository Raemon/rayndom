Being a wedding DJ in Rapid City I often work with Vicki and her team. Their work is stunning and always receives compliments from wedding guests. Vicki is friendly, receptive, and very organized.

I spaced ordering my flowers after looking at them and called in my order one week before the wedding. We had written down the order numbers of bouquets and corsages but when we called to order they had no idea of what numbers we were referring to. Amazingly they were able to accommodate my last-minute order, even during the holiday season. When we arrived to pick them up it took them a few moments to locate them but the corsages and bouquets were gorgeous! I would happily use their services again but would recommend giving them more time and calling ahead before picking up.

We had Dave from Petal Pusher help with our wedding and baseball themed wedding reception, and it was wonderful! The centerpieces incorporated baseballs, baseball gloves, and amazing flowers. Our bouquets were so bright and exactly what I was looking for. He also decorated the church and had so many wonderful ideas that make the place pop for our wedding ceremony and photos. He listened to what we wanted and exceeded our expectations. For any event in which flowers are needed, I would recommend Petal Pusher!

It was between them and a small hobby formal business. After we met with Bloomers we chose them because of the level of professionalism and willingness to work with us on unique ideas. It was all made very easy. The wedding day, they did not disappoint. Great service and experience all around!

I used Bella Rosa for our wedding reception flowers and my bouquet. Everything turned out absolutely beautiful! The floral consultant took my Pinterest board + my request to include carnations because they were my grandmother's favorite flower, and turned them into gorgeous arrangements! Highly recommend them! I also use Bella Rosa whenever I'm sending flowers to my family or friends. Really you can't go wrong with them.

We got married about a month and a half ago and Russ (and his amazing staff) made the process so easy! All of our guests raved about the gardens, which are tucked away behind a small shopping strip in Independence. Our wedding was in the garden with the reception in the Palm House. The way Russ works is that he has a set price for each wedding based on number of guests expected. You can chose an array of options, including photography, decorations and other services that fall into that price category. All flowers, real or faux must come from him and the venue fees fall into the price point as well. The things we opted for within our package were a photo calendar guest book which included several seasonal mini-photo shoots, linens, chairs and chair covers, decorations, flowers, and photography, along with the venue itself. We used the preferred vendors and could not have been happier with Randy the DJ, Chad the bartender and Hy-Vee on 23rd St. as our caterer. We also liked the option of dinner in the "treehouse" where we could eat alone just after we were married before we went to mingle with guests. Russ kept the guests in the know about the ceremony and what he asked of them in his gardens and was there to help solve even minor mishaps, including finding some craft glue in a glasses emergency. Our wedding was smooth enough that it felt like old hat but personal enough that we didn't feel like it was the same as everyone else's. There were no emergencies to fix and any issues that did arise were not brought to our attention, which was awesome. Russ tends toward the very traditional wedding ceremony but, if you want something less so he's flexible to accommodate that too, you just have to let him know. I'd recommend giving this place a look, it truly is a hidden gem under your nose and we're so glad we found it.
