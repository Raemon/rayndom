3T tents and events did an absolutely amazing job!! Not enough praise for Tanner and his team – top-notch all the way around! Quick to respond to inquiries and even made a last-minute addition possible. Set up crew did a fabulous job – tent, side walls, heater, tables, chairs, table cloths, dance floor – everything was in place and perfect! Tanner made sure we were 100% satisfied before leaving. 3-T will not disappoint – very highly recommend!! VERY reasonably priced as well. !!

The marquee letter lights that we rented from Letter Bright were a SHOWSTOPPER at our November 5th wedding! We had such a fun wedding hashtag and wanted to use it in a creative way, and after hearing about Letter Bright through our venue (The Venue at Birchwood), we knew this was the way to go! The team was fantastic to work with, and the final set up looked better than I could have even imagined! It easily ended up being one of my favorite parts about our special day, and our guests absolutely RAVED about it! I am so grateful that we got to work with Letter Bright and look forward to using them in the future for other events!! If you are looking for a beautiful, trendy display for your wedding or event, PLEASE reach out to them, you will not be disappointed!

Lisa was wonderful to work with! Its a little odd to say, but I've known for years before I even met my now-husband that I wanted the blue willow china plates at my wedding. Its a difficult ask and find, but Lisa was my saving grace! Not only that, but Lisa had these beautiful woven chargers that really wrapped together our garden party themed wedding. I am so thankful for Lisa and the Wedding Plate for giving me my dream aesthetic for my most perfect day!

We used BBJ Linen's to get our table cloths, napkins and chair covers. I HIGHLY recommend this vendor. We ordered online and also spoke with Mike. He worked with our pricing and even included a discount. I am not sure that this BBJ Linen was necessarily out of TN as this review may imply. I simply researched the company online and then used the 800 number provided to put in my order. The salesperson was highly knowledgeable and helpful. Items shipped as promised and were easy to return.

So helpful with picking out China/flatware/glasses/etc. I had to change some things last minute and they were very flexible. Everything arrived right on time and pickup went very smoothly! Would highly recommend.

Showtime Rentals was very helpful when we had to add things last minute. They offered high quality tables, punch fountain, and archway.
