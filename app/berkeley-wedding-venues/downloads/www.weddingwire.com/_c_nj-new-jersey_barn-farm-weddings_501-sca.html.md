Our wedding at Crossed Keys Estate was an absolute dream come true! From the moment we arrived, we knew this was the venue of our dreams. Danielle, our honorary flower girl, was one of the very first people who made that feeling real for us. She radiates kindness and warmth, and from day one, she made us feel welcomed, supported, and genuinely cared for. Danielle played such a meaningful role in bringing us to Crossed Keys, and we will forever be grateful to her for helping make this dream a reality. From the very first moment to the final goodbye, every single person we encountered went above and beyond in ways we never could have imagined. This is not just a venue. This is a family. Traci deserves her own standing ovation. She worked with us for months and never once fumbled a detail. Calm, organized, proactive, and endlessly kind, Traci made the entire planning process feel seamless and stress-free. On the wedding day itself, she was everywhere without ever being intrusive, anticipating needs before we even voiced them. When my bustle broke mid celebration, Traci and Kathrine, the owner, were literally on their hands and knees safety pinning my dress so I could be comfortable and keep dancing. That level of care and professionalism is rare, and it is unforgettable. Kathrine’s husband personally went to the Inn to retrieve items we forgot. Not once, but twice. That alone says everything you need to know about the people behind this place. The food deserves serious recognition. Every course was thoughtfully prepared, beautifully presented, and absolutely incredible. From cocktail hour through dinner, the quality and flavor were consistently next level. Guests are still talking about how good everything was, and several told us it was the best wedding food they have ever had. It was clear that the kitchen takes immense pride in what they serve, and it showed in every bite. The drinks were equally impressive and expertly crafted, adding to an already unforgettable experience. Every member of the staff was extraordinary, but a very special thank you to Barb, our incredible server, who made it her personal mission to keep us hydrated, fed, and happy. She followed us around all night, making sure we had water, drinks, and that we actually ate. She all but spoon-fed me, fully aware that I was never leaving that dance floor. Thank you for packing us pastries! They were absolutely delicious and the perfect ending to a perfect day! Jess, come on girl!! You and your team completely outdid yourselves. The decor was stunning and brought our entire vision to life in a way that exceeded every expectation. We are honestly at a loss for words. Crossed Keys Estate treats you like family, and that is something you feel in every interaction, every detail, and every moment of your day. A gigantic thank you to everyone at CKE. This is a place we will hold close to our hearts for years to come!

My husband and I got married in the Reserve in October 2025 and there are so many good things we have to say. Perona Farms is truly a dream wedding venue. From start to finish, the experience was exceptional—not only because of the amazing food (which our guests are still raving about), but because of the incredible people who make the entire day run so seamlessly. To start, the Reserve is an absolutely gorgeous venue with so much natural light. Our photographer and videographer could not stop raving about how the lighting in every inch of the venue was perfect for our pictures. I had a guest count of 235 people and was initially very stressed about the size of the main room, if the dance floor would be too small and if the tables would be too close to each other. The space was just fine and while it wasn't the most spacious of rooms, it was also not too crowded. Our guests still talk about how amazing the cocktail hour was, how there was so much food and how the drinks were also amazing. We did not have to add a single thing to the cocktail hour. Now onto talking about the people that helped make our wedding day truly the best day of our lives. Ivette, the main wedding coordinator, was an absolute rock throughout the planning process. She handled every detail with such care and professionalism, and even took the time to schedule a phone call with me to ease my stress over a tricky seating situation. Her calm, thoughtful approach made a world of difference and instantly put me at ease. On the wedding day itself, Maya, our bridal day-of coordinator, was a true gift. Her sweet, calming presence helped organize my very rambunctious crew and kept everything running smoothly without ever feeling rushed or overwhelming. She was so kind, attentive, and reassuring—exactly the energy every bride needs on such a big day. And then there’s Brendan, the most incredible maître d’. He constantly checked in on us, made sure we were well fed and our cups were always full. When our other shuttle failed to show up at the end of the night, Brendan went completely above and beyond by personally driving 30 of our guests back to the hotel in the Perona Farms van. It was such an unexpected act of kindness and care, and something we will never forget. Perona Farms isn’t just a beautiful venue with phenomenal food—it’s a place run by people who genuinely care about you, your guests, and your experience. We couldn’t have asked for a better team or a more perfect day. Highly, highly recommend

Bob, Meg and John are a great team. They accommodated multiple date changes through the pandemic and freely honored everything from the original contract. They are super responsive to any questions and so calming and kind. The venue itself is lovely. The outside area is beautifully landscaped, hosts a meandering stream and is located in a charming area. The building itself has a lower level for the cocktail hour and an upper dining room with a balcony overlooking the grounds. The upper bar is beautiful and leads to a front patio/porch that has fire pits surrounded by outdoor sofas. Guests had lots of places to be and still be a part of the action. I was concerned about the levels and stairs but they have ramps hidden in service areas to accommodate guests’ needs. Bob and the all the service staff cheerfully anticipated our needs and those of our guests. He felt like family. And even joined us for a dance! LOVE HIM! April Martorano- MOB

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ We attended a wedding at The Cart Barn at Pinelands Golf Club on Saturday night, and it was absolutely stunning! The venue comfortably holds 200+ guests, with plenty of space to mingle and enjoy the festivities. The food was delicious, the desserts were top-notch, and the hot coffee was a great touch. The staff was incredibly attentive, ensuring everything ran smoothly. The venue itself is breathtaking, with its rustic charm and beautiful views of the golf course. The garage doors opening to the greenery were a standout feature, and the fire pits added a cozy, inviting vibe. The outdoor gardens and manicured grounds made for a magical backdrop, perfect for a special celebration. Whether you’re planning a wedding or attending as a guest, this venue is a gem. The combination of the enchanting setting, great food and exceptional service make it a perfect choice for a memorable event. Highly recommend!

Picking a wedding venue and caterer are probably 2 of the biggest decisions you will make in your life. Luckily with Bishop Farmstead and Jam Catering you get a one stop shop that delivers. From day 1 when we inquired until the end of our event the staff was nothing short of phenomenal. Gina Borton was our event planner and she held our hand all of the way. If I emailed or texted a question or concern, I would have responses so timely, sometimes in the middle of then night! When the big day finally came Gina and the assistant coordinator Kayla had us running like clockwork. I truly cannot thank them enough for making the biggest day in me and wife’s lives so stress free and seamless. The process of planning a wedding can be daunting but when you can literally have your ceremony and reception at the same venue in different areas its a lot less stressful. JAM catering and Bishop Farmstead is really a good match that will leave you nothing short of amazed.

From the second we inquired about having our wedding at Johnson’s Locust Hall Farm, everyone a part of this amazing team/family was extremely responsive. Planning a wedding states away, while also in the process of moving is not an easy task, but the staff at the farm made everything seamless down to every little detail. Our wedding day was truly perfect and we cannot ever thank Johnson’s Locust Hall Farm enough for that. Not to mention, if you can get your floral arrangements done by their amazing team, you will not be disappointed. Allie has true talent and saw my vision immediately. All of my flowers were AMAZING. Including the small, but sentimental detail of a part of my mom’s wedding dress around the base. If you want a venue that treats you like a part of their family, this is the place to book. Thank you to everyone at Johnson’s Locust Hall Farm who gave us the wedding of our dreams!

We had our wedding at Cecil Creek in November and it was absolutely perfect. The entire planning process was seamless and, Denise was always there to answer the million questions I had, no matter how small or silly! Sam and his team treated us like family and I can’t even begin to name all of our guests that have said it was the best wedding they have ever been too. The food is incredible because they take pride in their work! No generic wedding food here!!! I wish we could get married every year at Cecil Creek Farm!!!

If you are looking for a venue with character and beauty, Prallsville Mills is it! Cynthia is the Event Coordinator for the site and she was so helpful through the entire process. We knew as soon as we went out to visit the Mills that it had to be our venue. There are multiple options on site for ceremony location and reception location, so you can customize your experience. Cynthia was there for us every step of the way with helpful suggestions and ideas to make our day perfect. All of our guests loved the look of the buildings, and our photographers were beyond thrilled to have so much to work with. There were so many opportunities for amazing shots because every part of the location is gorgeous. We did very minimal decorating to really let the character of the Mills come through, and it really was an ideal location. Rustic and elegant - we absolutely loved it!
