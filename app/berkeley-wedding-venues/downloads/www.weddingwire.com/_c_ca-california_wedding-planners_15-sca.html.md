Gina deserves 10 of out 5 stars! She was absolutely amazing for our La Valencia wedding in June! Throughout the entire process she responded to emails, calls, and texts promptly and professionally. As soon as we got engaged, there's a million things that go through your mind of what needs to get done. Gina was so helpful to break down for us when certain things needed to get done to make the process enjoyable, fun and not overwhelming. Right when we hired her (about a year before the wedding), she was all over getting our venue tours scheduled and vendors secured. As we live out of state, it was so helpful to have Gina's guidance on vendors! There's so many out there and she pointed us in the right direction on all of them! She has connections and recommendations to the BEST in San Diego! During the planning process she helped us with the big stuff all the way down to the little stuff with her attention to detail, ideas and creativity! As the big day approached, she worked with all the vendors directly, which made things so much easier on us! When the big day arrived, everything went seamlessly! Gina kept everyone and everything on track, while also being right there for me whenever I needed a bobby pin, a drink or a deep breath. It was like she was everywhere at once, but in a behind the scenes kind of way. People always say wedding planning is so stressful. For us it was not at all, and we honestly have Gina to thank for that and for making our one year engagement and wedding planning such a special year for us! Couldn't recommend her enough! She is worth her price and much more!

I have worked with Lindsay as a florist for over 8 years. She is by far one of the most creative, professional designer/planners that I have collaborated with during my 10 years as a wedding florist. She has incredible attention to detail, grace under pressure, and such a positive attitude. I would hire her in a heartbeat.

Cierra was incredible to work with and made our wedding day run so smoothly. She was super responsive and met with us over Zoom multiple times (and once in person) to make sure every detail was covered. She had the answer to all of our questions and helped build the most detailed wedding timeline — down to the minute — so everything stayed perfectly on track. Our rehearsal went seamlessly with her guidance on how to walk and even how parents should hold arms. On the wedding day, everything flowed beautifully. I was nervous to walk down the aisle, but Cierra reassured me and helped calm my anxiety. The reception looked stunning, she helped bustle my dress with ease, and at the end of the night, she packed everything up neatly for us to pick up later. I couldn’t have asked for a better coordinator!

I didn't want to romanticize the wedding day too much, but it was more than I could've ever imagined. The Wedding Connection is experienced, calm, and relaxed. Casey was great to work with, and highly recommend this team for your wedding needs. They provided a project planning site with an extensive checklist, vendor recommendations, and checked up throughout the process to see if we needed help with anything. Casey provided recommendations if I ever was unsure of something, and helped make the day extra special. Thank you Wedding Connection!

Working with Darlene and Jim was truly one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. From the very first conversation, they made us feel seen, heard, and completely at ease. Their attention to detail, warmth, and genuine passion for what they do radiated through every step of the process. They didn’t just plan our wedding—they brought it to life. Every vision we had was thoughtfully executed and elevated in ways we never could have imagined. On the day of, Darlene and Jim created a calm, seamless environment that allowed us to be fully present, knowing that everything was in the most capable hands. Our wedding day was nothing short of magical, and so much of that is because of their tireless work behind the scenes. We are beyond grateful for their guidance, kindness, and the personal touch they brought to every moment. We truly can’t recommend them highly enough!

Natalie has been the planner on two of my friend's weddings. Both were very different experiences. Each one designed for the uniqueness of the couple. She handles it all, from recommending the best of the best Djs, photographers, hair/make-up, cake, you name, she will make it happen! She is easy to reach if you need her and eager to truly make your wedding experience a dream come true!

Since we were planning our wedding from Ohio we wanted a coordinator in Santa Barbara. My sister came across Weddings by the Sea and I’m so glad we chose them. It was so nice to have Catherine taking care of all the details for us. She was able to provide recommendations for where to hold the ceremony and kept us informed of the whole process. It turned out so amazing, from the set up, to the officiant and the photographer, we could not have asked for a better ceremony. All our guests were so impressed and thought it was just beautiful. I would definitely recommend Catherine for any couple looking to hire a coordinator.

Tosca was great. She helped guide us through the wedding process from soup to nuts. She was helpful in thinking about our decor, our theme, and finding vendors. She helped us find our photographer, photo booth folks, and in the last few months leading up to our big day she really helped to make sure we were on target with our to do's and she kept all of our vendors updated and on the same page.
