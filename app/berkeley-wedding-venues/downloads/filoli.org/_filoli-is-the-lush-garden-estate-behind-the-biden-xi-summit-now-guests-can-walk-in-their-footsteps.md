##  Filoli is the lush garden estate behind the Biden-Xi Summit; now guests can walk in their footsteps

November 22, 2023 | [Press Releases](https://filoli.org/press-releases/)

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

Woodside, CA, November 22, 2023– Filoli, the renowned historic estate nestled in the heart of the Bay Area, has been a local landmark for decades. The estate welcomes over 400,000 visitors every year and is a popular destination for private events and weddings. Just not last Wednesday. Top aides to President Biden worked with Chinese officials to ensure that the estate would be the perfect backdrop to host a diplomatic summit between President Biden and President Xi Jinping of China.

Known for many iconic on-screen roles including the 1980s American soap opera Dynasty, Filoli is an idyllic example of the American home and spirit. The estate was built on the gold-mining fortune of William Bowers Bourn II, who named Filoli after his personal credo: **FI** ght for a just cause, **LO** ve your fellow man, and**LI** ve a good life.

“We are honored to have been chosen as the site for this historic meeting between President Biden and President Xi Jinping,” says President & CEO Kara Newport. “Filoli is known as a place of respite and healing for our thousands of visitors in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we hope that our beautiful site fulfilled the needs of this important international event.”

The world watched as President Xi’s car approached Filoli’s entry courtyard midmorning on November 15. President Biden stood waiting in Filoli’s portico, at the entrance of the 54,000 square, 56-room house built in 1917. The two leaders greeted each other with a historic handshake and walked in through the front door.

President Biden and President Xi sat down for an extensive bilateral meeting between their two delegations in Filoli’s 2,000 square foot Ballroom. This immaculate room showcases floor to ceiling murals of Muckross, Filoli’s sister estate in Ireland and shines with opulent gold trimmed molding. Crystal chandeliers were inspired by Versailles’ lighting fixtures in the Hall of Mirrors.

Later in the day, President Biden held a press conference in the same room, where he stood in front of a scaled replica of Versailles’ Hercules Salon fireplace.

In a final photo-op, President Biden and President Xi walked through Filoli’s lush 16-acre garden. The two strolled along Filoli’s terrace lawn with an iconic view of the Sunken Garden behind them, passing shrubs of wisteria, azaleas, and a pair of Hinoki cypress trees that came from the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition.

Visitors to Filoli are invited to walk in the footsteps of these world leaders and snap their own photos in Filoli’s historic house and gardens. While touring the House, visitors can view Filoli’s original guest book from the Bourn era which now includes signatures from both President Biden and President Xi on display, and add their own signatures.
