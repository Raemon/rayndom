FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Woodside, CA, March 13, 2024- 

Filoli is working with the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone to create the new Lamchin Interpretive Center, a place to share the story of the first people of the San Francisco Peninsula. The Interpretive Center will open on June 8, 2024, along with a brand new trail, expanding access to the 650+ acres of natural lands that surround Filoli’s iconic House and Garden. 

Filoli sits on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Lamchin, an independent tribe of the Ramaytush Ohlone peoples, the original inhabitants and stewards of the San Francisco Peninsula. Lamchin families from the village of Ssupichom had an intimate relationship with this land.

**The Lamchin Interpretive Center**

Guests can currently explore Filoli’s one-mile nature trail, an easy and family-friendly loop encouraging visitors to use their senses to observe different ecosystems as they pass by woodlands, meadows, and creeks. At the halfway point, a meadow opens to redwood trees and a structure previously known as the Sally MacBride Nature Center. Originally a foaling barn for the Roths, the Sally MacBride Nature Center opened in 1988. Named after the founder of Filoli’s nature education program, the center housed nature education exhibits shared with youth on field trips and visitors on guided tours. In 2017 it opened to all visitors when the self-guided nature trail opened. 

In June of 2024, the building reopens as the Lamchin Interpretive Center, continuing the educational mission with a focus on the story of the Lamchin tribe of the Ramaytush Ohlone peoples, the original inhabitants of this land. “Sally MacBride and her legacy of conserving nature, advancing education in nature, and providing access, especially to children, will live on through our new plans and programs,” says President & CEO Kara Newport. “The new Lamchin Interpretive Center will inspire and educate families and school groups every day.” [Learn more about Filoli’s Youth Programs here](https://filoli.org/filoli-creates-meaningful-access-and-connections-for-youth-in-need/).

The renovation of the Nature Center is funded in part by the National Trust for Historic Preservation and created in collaboration with the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone. This partnership is central to our discussion of land use and management. The new Interpretive Center will be unique in that the exhibition is co-curated with the Ramaytush Ohlone leaders and will tell a story of Indigenous people through time. “We are pleased to be in partnership with Filoli to tell the story of the Lamchin tribe that occupied the land upon which Filoli now rests, and to share the broader history of the Ramaytush Ohlone peoples and the current work of the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone,” says Jonathan Cordero, Chair of the Ramaytush Ohlone peoples and Executive Director of their non-profit association. 

Land is central in defining Filoli. The land provides a sense of place and represents a longstanding history, chronicling past, present, and future. Filoli is committed to providing access and connection with all people and the land. “Last year, we raised funds specifically to support our nature programs that include access for our preschool and teen programs as well as opening more trails for the public. Our future plans also include deepening our commitment to natural lands management and conservation science,” continues Newport. 

**New Trail: Spring Creek Loop**

Beginning this summer, the new Spring Creek trail loop will officially open to the public. It will be celebrated alongside the Lamchin Interpretive Center opening, reimagined as a space for the Ramaytush Ohlone to tell their story and that of the land. The Spring Creek loop starts at the midway point of the one-mile nature trail right next to the Center. Visitors follow the story of water as they hike along a scenic creek bed and historic flume, a water infrastructure built over 100 years ago by William Bourn, the industrialist who constructed Filoli.

This hike takes guests uphill on winding paths through towering redwoods, fern-covered understory, and ever-changing flora and fauna, from mushrooms and newts in winter to wildflowers and songbirds in spring. Filoli’s Master Plan was finalized last year and envisions the next 20 years for the site, laying out new ways to connect visitors to the Natural Lands and support a sustainable and resilient future. 

Filoli’s Natural Lands Manager Ian Walsh has been working on this project since last year. “I am excited for visitors to witness the power of water, seeing firsthand the dramatic erosion that the roaring creek carved out in the wake of heavy rains during January of 2023,” says Walsh. Guests will walk across a newly installed bridge as they hike. “See if you can spot the old bridge, still perched on the rocks hundreds of feet downstream from where it was swept off its foundation during the flood!” Walsh shares. “I hope these striking examples emphasize the importance of Filoli’s work in sustainability and adaptation to our changing climate.”

**_We look forward to welcoming you to the Lamchin Interpretive Center and Spring Creek Trail starting June 8, 2024!_**
