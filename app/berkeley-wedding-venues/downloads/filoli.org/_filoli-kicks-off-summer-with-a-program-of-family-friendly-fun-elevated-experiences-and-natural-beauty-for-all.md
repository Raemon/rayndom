##  Filoli kicks off summer with a program of family-friendly fun, elevated experiences, and natural beauty for all

June 20, 2023 | [Press Releases](https://filoli.org/press-releases/)

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Woodside, CA, June, 21, 2023- Filoli is a nationally recognized historic landmark and vibrant landscape of the Bay Area with 16 acres of formal gardens, a 54,000 square foot Georgian Revival style mansion, over 600 acres of protected Peninsula watershed. Today on the summer solstice, the site announces their 2023 program for the season, including after-hours experiences, live performances, and a guaranteed beautiful garden display.

Filoli is open every day, and a stroll through the summer [Garden](https://filoli.org/whats-blooming) is a delight for the senses! Take in the decadent scents of lavender, over 500 rose bushes, and the colorful rows of vegetables. Silver and blue perennials and succulents are paired with a parade of pink annuals including begonias, fuchsias, and zinnias. Those inspired by the beauty can even lend a hand at maintaining the Garden through [Service Learning](https://filoli.org/service-learning) projects. These programs provide a free learning experience on a variety of topics, such as horticulture and garden tips and tricks, combined with an opportunity to volunteer to support Filoli.

To experience the beauty of the summer garden in the golden hour, Filoli stays open until 8pm every Thursday through September 21, 2023[. Summer Nights](https://filoli.org/summer-nights) invite guests to meet up for a drink at Filoli’s Bluebird Bar or relax on the lawn with their families. A local food truck serves dinner in the Meadow overlooking the sunset and live acoustic tunes fill the air throughout the gardens. 

For more summer evening fun, vibrant live performances take stage against the backdrop of Filoli’s historic House. From June through September, a diversity of talent from the Bay Area performing arts community takes Filoli’s [Summer Stage](https://filoli.org/summer-stage). As the sun sets behind the Santa Cruz mountains, guests relax in the Meadow with a drink in hand and enjoy the show. From Funk and soul to hip-hop opera, this line up showcases a delightful mix of talent in an unforgettable setting. 

In July, over 40 hand-picked local artists sell their work throughout FIloli’s Garden for [Art Walk](https://filoli.org/art-walk). Wander among the flowers while browsing original paintings, prints, ceramics, jewelry, textiles, and more. Shop up an appetite and stop by the Grove for lunch then make your way to the Woodland Garden Court for an afternoon performance by local music group the Kyle Hernandez Trio.

Special experiences are also available throughout the summer season, including[ Flora & Garden Parties](https://filoli.org/parties) to create stunning floral creations while enjoying friends and flora in Filoli’s Garden. Enjoy light snacks and drinks as you unleash your creativity and take inspiration from the Garden around you!

Throughout the Garden and historic House, Yoko Kubrick’s abstract marble sculptures tell the timeless tales of [Ovid’s Metamorphosis](https://filoli.org/yoko-kubrick). Kubrick’s works infuse classic heroines with her own language of form and nature. Kubrick’s work is on view through November 6, 2023, available with all Filoli admission.

Filoli is open every day from 10am-5pm including access to the House, Garden, Estate Trail, Clock Tower Shop, and Quail Café. Buying tickets online is recommended at filoli.org and sell-outs are expected during peak seasons and special events.

Filoli is a vibrant landscape of the Bay Area, situated on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Lamchin, an independent tribe of the Ramaytush Ohlone peoples, in Woodside, California. The estate boasts 654 acres of beauty nestled along the slopes of California’s coastal range. Originally built as a private residence in 1917, Filoli was opened to the public in 1975 as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and site of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The property is considered one of the finest remaining country estates of the 20th century, featuring a 54,000+ square-foot Georgian revival-style mansion, 16 acres of exquisite English Renaissance gardens, a 6.8-acre Gentleman’s Orchard, and hundreds of acres of Natural Lands with 5 distinct ecosystems and a 1-mile Estate Trail. Filoli is dedicated to connecting our rich history with a vibrant future through beauty, nature and shared stories, so that one day all people will honor nature, value unique experiences, and appreciate beauty in everyday life.
