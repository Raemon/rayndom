Find peace in the Garden this Winter at Filoli. Foliage is vibrant in the cool wet, and pops of color from holly, camellias, and narcissus bring the Garden to life. Join us for this beautiful season at Filoli!

[ Some Vegetable Garden beds are planted with Borage as a winter crop. The star-shaped blue flowers are edible and also attract polinators. ](https://filoli.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Borage.jpg)

[ Walk the California and Spring Creek Trails, and take in the lush green mosses and striking fungi. ](https://filoli.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Fungi-1400x1159.jpg)

[ Fragrant Paperwhites are among the first bulbs to bloom in the Garden during the early winter months. ](https://filoli.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Paperwhites-1050x1400.jpg)

[ The richly colored flowers of the 'Matsubara Red' Flowering Apricot next to the stairs to the High Place attract bees and other pollinators during the cold months of winter. ](https://filoli.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Matsubara-Red-Double-Red-Flowering-Apricot-1050x1400.jpeg)

[ Look up to see one of the unusual varieties of camellias planted in the Woodland Garden by Mrs. Roth, the hybrid Camellia x williamsii 'Holland Orchid'. ](https://filoli.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Holland-Orchid-1383x1400.jpg)

[ Despite their name, the Tasmanian Tree Ferns in the Woodland Garden are not technically trees. They don’t have any true wood in their trunks, but take on a tree-like form with lacy leaves sprouting from the top.  ](https://filoli.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tazmanian-Tree-Fern-1050x1400.jpg)

[ Look out for the pink-edged blooms of the 'Margaret Davis' Japanese Camellia in the Courtyard at the front of the House.  ](https://filoli.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Margaret-Davis-1050x1400.jpg)

[ Spring Snowflakes dot the beds around the Balustrade behind the House - look closely to see the green spots on their white, bell-like blooms. ](https://filoli.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SpringSnowflake-1050x1400.jpg)

[ Among the winter crops in the Vegetable Garden, Ornamental Kale stands out with its striking purple color. ](https://filoli.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ornamental-Kale-1050x1400.jpg)

[ Filoli's two magnificent 'Camperdown' Elms are a sight to behold in the winter as they reveal their twisting moss-covered branches. This contorted variety was first discovered at the Camperdown estate in Scotland. ](https://filoli.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Filoli-7180-933x1400.jpg)
