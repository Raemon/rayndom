# Brown Butter Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Loaf

There’s something magical about the transition into fall at Wente Family Vineyards — the air turns crisp, the vines settle after harvest, and the kitchen fills with the scent of warm spices and baked pumpkin. To celebrate the season, we’ve partnered with Emily Rangel to create this Brown Butter Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Loaf — a cozy, decadent treat that’s even better when enjoyed with a glass of Wente Sandstone Merlot. This loaf combines nutty brown butter, earthy pumpkin, and a touch of chocolate for a dessert that’s both nostalgic and refined — the perfect companion to a slow autumn afternoon or fireside evening with wine in hand. 

## Ingredients

½ cup unsalted butter, browned 

1¼ cups light brown sugar 

2 large eggs 

1 cup pumpkin puree 

⅓ cup plain Greek yogurt 

1 tbsp vanilla bean paste 

1¾ cups all-purpose flour 

2 tsp pumpkin spice 

½ tsp salt 

1 tsp baking powder 

1 tsp baking soda 

1 cup mini chocolate chips

## Instructions

1

Brown the Butter: In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, melt butter and stir until it turns golden brown and gives off a nutty aroma. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool completely. 

2

Mix Wet Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together cooled brown butter, brown sugar, eggs, pumpkin puree, Greek yogurt, and vanilla bean paste until smooth. 

3

Add Dry Ingredients: Gently fold in flour, pumpkin spice, salt, baking powder, and baking soda until just combined. Don’t overmix — the key to a tender loaf is a light hand. 

4

Add Chocolate Chips: Fold in mini chocolate chips, saving a few for topping. 

5

Bake: Preheat your oven to 375°F. Grease and line a loaf pan with parchment paper. Pour in the batter, smooth the top, and make a shallow slit down the center with a butter knife. Sprinkle extra chocolate chips on top for a bakery-style finish. Bake for 50–60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 

6

Cool and Serve: Let cool for 10–15 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a wire rack. Slice, serve warm, and enjoy the cozy flavors of fall.

#### **Why It Pairs Perfectly with Sandstone Merlot**

The Sandstone Merlot is the perfect partner for this loaf’s deep, spiced sweetness. With aromas of dark cherry, plum, and toasted oak, this Merlot mirrors the warmth of the brown butter and enhances the pumpkin spice and chocolate notes with its soft tannins and velvety finish.

Each sip brings out the loaf’s richness — making this a pairing that feels indulgent yet perfectly balanced.
