### Fermentation And Aging

The various wine components were fermented separately in upright stainless steel tanks with pneumantage twice a day to maximize the extraction of aromas and textures. This wine was carefully aged for 18 months prior to bottling, with 20% of the blend matured in new French oak barrels for added complexity and structure. The remaining 80% was aged in seasoned second and third-use French oak barrels, seamlessly integrating the wine's flavors while imparting subtle nuances of spice and toast.
