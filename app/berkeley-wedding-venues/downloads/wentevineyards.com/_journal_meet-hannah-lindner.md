###  Viticulture Manager

Hannah has been on our team for just over five years as our Viticulture Manager. She plays a pivotal role ensuring that each of our vineyard blocks is farmed meticulously as each requires a unique approach to showcase the varieties grown in each.

#### _Q + A with Hannah Lindner_

**What is your favorite part of your job?**

The people and the culture. There is something incredibly special about this group of people and I feel so lucky to come to work every day.

**What energizes you about your work?**

Every day brings something new. There are so many opportunities to find creative solutions to problems we encounter.

**What are the most important skills you have learned in your role?**

I think the most important skills. I have practiced is patience and slowing down. It has allowed me to spend more time actively listening to those around me.

**How have you built confidence and resiliency throughout your career?**

Constantly pushing myself to step outside of my comfort zone. It can be intimidating but it’s how you grow!

**How have you balanced being a mother and a professional?**

My son was born on Valentine’s Day last year, so being a working mom is new to me. It is so rewarding but it has also been challenging. I really try and focus on being in the moment.

**How do you unplug from work?**

Even after a long day, I try to always make some time for some sort of movement. If I can carve out half an hour with some headphones and my Peloton, I am a whole new person.

**What is your favorite Wente Vineyards wine?**

One of my favorite Wente wines is the [Azul Verde](https://wentestage.wpenginepowered.com/product/2018-azul-verde) or [Winemakers Selection Lot 012](https://wentestage.wpenginepowered.com/product/2018-lot-012-red-blend). The blend comes from two of our core ranches found here in the Livermore Valley. Both blocks are farmed meticulously, and I think this wine showcases the varieties we grow here well.
