# 2023 Limited Release Chardonnay

For over a century, the Wente family has played a pioneering role in the development of California Chardonnay. This limited release is meticulously crafted from our estate-grown, certified sustainable vineyards and partially aged in French oak barrels. With vibrant notes of green apple, citrus, and subtle vanilla, the wine presents a refined balance of freshness and complexity. We are proud to offer this distinguished expression of our continued dedication to Chardonnay excellence.

##  Tasting Notes 

This wine displays aromas and flavors of perfectly ripened green apples, candied citrus, and freshly sliced pears.The optimally ripened fruit is complimented by a tasteful measure of slightly creamy French oak spice that hints at notes of vanilla and toasted brioche. The mouthfeel is slightly viscous and supple on entry but manages to maintain youthful energy thanks to some carefully integrated supporting acidity that assures that the wine is as carefully balanced as it is wonderfully rich.

### Fermentation And Aging

The wine was fermented in a combination of stainless-steel tanks and French oak barrels. Stainless-steel tank fermentations retain fresh fruit flavors and aromatics. Barrel fermentation adds depth and mouthfeel along with oak spice complexity. A portion of this wine was aged for thirteen months in French oak barrels. The wine was aged sur lie for six months and stirred regularly. The balance was aged in neutral oak and stainless-steel tanks to retain fresh fruit character and acidity.
