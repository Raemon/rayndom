##  Tasting Notes 

Our 2021 Artist Series GSM rides the line between bright Grenache and savory Syrah with a hint of Mourvedre. The aromas range from cranberry sauce from the Grenache to smoked meats from the Syrah. This wine offers continuous flavors of fruit with a subtle touch of vanilla that rounds out the wine. The mouthfeel is gently firmed by fine grain tannins that promise to hold this wine up for years or to be enjoyed today.
