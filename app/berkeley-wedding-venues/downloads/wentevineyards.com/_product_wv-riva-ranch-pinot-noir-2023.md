# 2023 Riva Ranch Pinot Noir

The 2023 Riva Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir is a vibrant and expressive representation of the Arroyo Seco appellation. This vintage opens with youthful aromas of ripe black cherries, red currants, and earthy undertones, elegantly layered with notes of toasty oak spice, including hints of baked cinnamon, clove, and toasted brioche. On the palate, supple, rounded tannins and lively acidity create a harmonious balance, carrying the wine gracefully from start to finish.
