# Dark Chocolate Cabernet Truffles by Bryan Anderson

These decadent chocolate-flavored truffles may sound fancy but are a breeze to make and only need a handful of simple ingredients. They are also very adaptable to your favorite toppings and whatever you have on hand. We highly suggest using good-quality chocolate for the best-tasting truffle. The mixture of chocolate and cream melted together to create a luscious chocolaty sauce to form your truffle ganache. The addition of Cabernet brings flavor and richness to the truffles. The combination is left to cool in the fridge or freezer for several hours to firm up. Once chilled, scoop out small chunks using an ice-cream scoop or melon baller to two-teaspoon size mounds. You can make them bigger if you like, but remember that they are dense. Next, get your hands covered in chocolate by shaping the truffles into balls and roll in the topping of your choice. Get creative. You can roll your batter in cocoa powder, powdered sugar, crushed nuts, shredded coconut, crushed candy, and more. It is the perfect treat that is quick and easy to gift to friends or enjoy by oneself. When enjoying with wine, we recommend taking a sip of the wine and then a bit of the truffle for the optimal pairing. 

## Ingredients

2 Cups 70-72% Dark Chocolate

1/2 Cups Heavy Cream

1/4 Cup + 2 Tablespoons Cabernet Sauvignon

3 Tablespoons Butter

## Instructions

1

Place the chocolate in a heat-proof bowl. Set aside.

2

Heat the heavy cream and wine until it is simmering.

3

Add the butter to the chocolate and pour the heavy cream evenly on top. Let the warm cream, wine, and chocolate sit for 5 minutes. Add the vanilla extract, then stir until the chocolate has completely melted.

4

Pour into a flat, shallow dish, such as an 8×8-inch baking pan, so the mixture quickly sets

5

Refrigerate or freeze for 1-2 hours.

6

Scoop the set truffle mixture into two teaspoon-sized mounds. For larger truffles, roll to 1 tablespoon size.

7

Roll into balls and coat in toppings like sprinkles, cocoa powder, or crushed nuts. You can also dip the truffles in melted or tempered chocolate.

8

Cover tightly and store truffles at room temperature for 3-4 days or in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

9

Tip: For citrus lovers, add lemon, lime, or orange zest and let steep in the warm cream for 10-15 minutes for a delicious citrus addition! Of course, the longer it steeps, the stronger it gets.
