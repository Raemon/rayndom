## Instructions

1

Preheat your oven to 425°F and place one rack in the middle and the other near the top.

2

Mince the parsley and garlic. Grate 2 tablespoons of Parmigiano Reggiano.

3

Heat a large pan over medium-low heat. Sauté the minced garlic and shallots in 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter until fragrant (about 2 minutes).

4

Add the breadcrumbs, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and the grated Parmigiano Reggiano. Mix well, then remove from the heat and set aside.

5

Pat dry the shrimp with paper towels, then season with salt and pepper to taste. In an 18-inch oven-safe baking dish or large pan, arrange the shrimp with the tails pointing up. Top the shrimp with the breadcrumb mixture and pour the Chardonnay around the shrimp.

6

Top the shrimp with 6 tablespoons of cubed cold butter, sprinkle the sun-dried tomatoes on top, and drizzle a couple of tablespoons of olive oil over the breadcrumbs.

7

Bake for 10 minutes or until the shrimp are cooked through. After 10 minutes, move the dish to the top rack and broil for 1-2 minutes until the breadcrumbs are golden brown. Watch carefully to prevent burning.

8

Remove from the oven and serve with lemon wedges and the garlicky pan sauce. Serve with crusty bread to mop up the sauce. Enjoy!
