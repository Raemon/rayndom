# Festive Mozzarella Cherry Tomato and Olive Skewers

These Mozzarella, Cherry Tomato, and Olive Skewers are not only delicious but also make for a colorful and eye-catching appetizer for your holiday celebrations. They can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator before serving. This would pair well with a Wente Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc such as Louis Mel Sauvignon Blanc or our Limited Release Sauvignon Blanc. 

## Ingredients

Fresh mozzarella balls (bocconcini)

Cherry tomatoes

Green or black olives, pitted

Rosemary for presentation

Wooden or bamboo skewers

## Instructions

1

Drain the mozzarella balls if they are stored in liquid. Wash the cherry tomatoes and pat them dry. If olives have pits, remove them. 

2

Start by threading a cherry tomato onto the skewer. Add a mozzarella ball next, followed by an olive. Repeat the pattern until the skewer is filled, leaving a bit of space at each end for easy handling. 

3

Arrange the assembled skewers on a serving platter. If you’d like, add rosemary springs for a extra festive touch.
