# 2022 nth DEGREE Merlot

Our 2022 Merlot has aromatics of candied red cherry and a touch of blueberry jam, a sweet and fruity profile, while the notes of cocoa and baked cinnamon add layers of complexity and warmth. A full body wine with s substantial mouth feel that finishes with big silky tannins. A well-structured wine that provides a balanced and smooth conclusion to each sip.

**95 points, Cellar Selection | #46 in Wine Enthusiast’s Top 100 Cellar Selection Wines for 2025**

_"This wine is a cellar selection from Wente Vineyards, the Nth Degree. I have been lucky to have tasted multiple vintages with age. The wine is lush, with aromas of red plums, cassis, thyme, dried florals, and notes of vanilla on the nose; the palate speaks of ripe, youthful Bing cherry, yellow plum, dried Sage, structure, interwoven with mineral, silky tannins, and no sharp edges. Aerate or cellar until 2030 pair with grilled wagyu beef, black truffle butter"_ **— Tonya Pitts, Wine Enthusiast**

##  Tasting Notes 

Generous flavors and aromas of ripe red cherry and plum form the foundation of the 2022 nth DEGREE Merlot. The vibrant fruit character is complimented by complex and rich oak layering highlighting flavors of cocoa and espresso bean. Inherent plump richness on the mid-pallet is supported by a careful measure of well-structured velvety tannin.
