# Chardonnay

## Test

#  Chardonnay 

Chardonnay is very dear to Wente Vineyards. In 1912, 2nd Generation Ernest Wente persuaded his father and founder, C.H. Wente, to import Chardonnay cuttings from France to the Livermore Valley. Ernest hand-picked vines that showed the best health and pronounced flavors ultimately created the ‘Wente Clone.’ Today, over 75% of all California Chardonnay stems from the Wente Clone and the Wente Family property.

#Morning-Fog-Chardonnay

###  Morning Fog Chardonnay

Our Morning Fog Chardonnay is named for the morning coastal fog pushed by Pacific wind streams into the bowl of the San Francisco Bay. This daily phenomenon moderates the climate to produce excellent, beautifully balanced Chardonnay.

**Tasting Notes**

Our Morning Fog Chardonnay bursts with citrus and green apple aromas, complemented by hints of toasty oak and vanilla from barrel aging. Its lingering minerality and natural acidity balance it to create a beautiful wine.

## Recipe Pairing

### Pan Seared Scallops with Citrus & Shallot Butter

Seared scallops are a wonderful mild, buttery pairing with our 2022 Morning Fog Chardonnay, a wine with a citrusy aroma and notes of green apple complemented by hints of toasty oak and vanilla from barrel-aging. This wine is balanced by a lingering minerality and natural acidity that highlights the seafood’s natural sweetness. This recipe comes together quickly and will be an impressive meal for a night in or entertaining.

#Riva-Ranch-Chardonnay

###  Riva Ranch Chardonnay

Our Riva Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay is sourced exclusively from our Riva Ranch Vineyard in Arroyo Seco, Monterey. Arroyo Seco, where we have been growing grapes since the 1960s, is widely regarded as one of the best places in California to grow Chardonnay. The long, cool growing season with the deep, gravelly soil ripens the Chardonnay perfectly, which gives a natural balance of sugar and acidity.

**Tasting Notes**

The 2022 Riva Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay has plenty of character. It is loaded with perfectly ripened apples, lemon curd, and toasted brioche, which team together to form the foundation of this deep and delightfully expressive vineyard selection. The optimally ripened fruit is complimented by a tasteful measure of slightly creamy oak that hints at notes of toasted marshmallow, along with a dollop of buttery richness that lasts well into the lengthy finish.
