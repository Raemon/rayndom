# 2024 Wente Clone Chardonnay

The Wente Clone Chardonnay is a limited-production release that is sourced from our Ernest and Eric Ranches, where the Wente family’s original heritage vines continue to thrive. It showcases the purity and character of the historic Wente Clone—layered with aromas of ripe green apple, pear, and citrus, and a palate that unfolds with apricot, minerality, and subtle creamy French oak. An expression of place and legacy, it honors the craftsmanship that helped shape California Chardonnay.

##  Tasting Notes 

Our 2024 Wente Clone Chardonnay displays aromas of ripe green apples, pear, citrus and a touch of minerality. The palate shows apricot, green apple and minerality followed by subtle creamy French Oak. The mouthfeel is slightly viscous and supple on entry but manages to maintain youthful energy thanks to some carefully integrated supporting acidity that assures that the wine is as carefully balanced as it is wonderfully rich.
