#  How To Host a Midnight Disco Dinner Party 

###  Hosted by Anastasia Mida

January is the perfect month to gather—after the rush of the holidays, when evenings feel slower and more intentional. A **Midnight Disco–themed dinner party** blends candlelit elegance with playful sparkle, creating a mood that feels equal parts chic and celebratory. Hosted by [Anastasia Midas](https://www.instagram.com/anastasiamidas/reel/DT0-NMNkZJ2/?hl=en) and centered around [**Riva Ranch Chardonnay**](https://wentevineyards.com/product/wv-riva-ranch-chardonnay-2024), this style of gathering proves that winter hosting can still shine.

## 

Set the Scene: Candlelight Meets Disco Glow

The foundation of a Midnight Disco dinner party is contrast. Soft draping and warm candlelight create intimacy, while reflective details bring energy to the table. Neutral linens keep the look clean and elevated, allowing deep red napkins, seasonal florals, and metallic accents to stand out.

Disco ball elements scattered along the table catch the candlelight and add subtle movement, giving the space a festive glow without overwhelming the setting. Vintage-inspired glassware and silver candleholders keep the table grounded in timeless style.

**Hosting tip:** Keep the palette tight—ivory, deep red, silver, and soft gold—to ensure the sparkle feels intentional rather than playful.

The Star of the Night: Riva Ranch Chardonnay

Every great dinner party needs a centerpiece wine, and [**Riva Ranch Chardonnay**](https://wentevineyards.com/product/wv-riva-ranch-chardonnay-2024) carries the evening effortlessly. Known for its balance, richness, and versatility, this Chardonnay transitions seamlessly from the first pour to the final bite.

Its expressive fruit, layered texture, and refreshing acidity make it ideal for winter entertaining—elegant enough for a styled tablescape, yet approachable for relaxed conversation.

**Serving tip:** Chill slightly before guests arrive, then let the wine warm gently in the glass as the evening unfolds to reveal its full complexity.

### Golden Chicken with Roasted Tomatoes

A perfect pairing for Wente Family Vineyards Riva Ranch Chardonnay This roasted chicken with tomatoes recipe highlights fresh, California-inspired flavors. Juicy chicken, slow-roasted cherry tomatoes, and fragrant herbs come together in one pan for a dish that feels both comforting and elegant. It pairs beautifully with Wente Family Vineyards Riva Ranch Chardonnay. As the tomatoes roast, they become sweet and jammy, creating a light pan sauce that complements the savory chicken. Finished with fresh herbs and olive oil, this dish reflects the relaxed, food-forward style of wine country cooking.
