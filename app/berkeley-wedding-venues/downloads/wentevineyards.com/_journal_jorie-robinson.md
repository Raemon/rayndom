#  Meet Jorie Robinson 

###  Buyer

Jorie is a Wente Vineyards Buyer, she manages the procurement of dry goods for all of our wines, contracted labor, and DMV for all company vehicles. Jorie is our teams voice in relationships with vendors and suppliers, ensuring that both sides are content and meeting expectations. Read more about her role and what inspires her below.

**Q: Briefly describe your role at Wente Vineyards.**

A: I help with ordering dry goods, specifically labels, as well as managing vendors, supplier relationships, processing and approving invoices, and working on purchase orders. Outside of my Buyer role, I handle DMV for all company vehicles and I process invoices for our contract labor which includes viticulture, bottling, warehouse, winemaking, etc.

**Q: How long have you worked with Wente Vineyards?**

A: I am coming up on my 5th year in June, 2022!

**Q: What is your favorite part of your job?**

A: My Team. They have been amazing to work with and I am constantly learning from them every day.

**Q: Is there a woman in your life that inspires you?**

A: May be cliché, but I would have to say my mom. She showed me what a working mom and wife looks like, and did an amazing job juggling it all. She has no quit in her and she always keeps her head up no matter what is going on.

**Q: How have you balanced being a mother and a professional?**

A: This has been very tough, and I’m still figuring out the balance everyday. I’m learning that it is okay to take a moment to breathe and clear my mind so that I don’t become too overwhelmed. It is definitely a work in progress.

**Q: How do you unplug from work?**

A: W-I-N-E, spending time with my family and friends, cooking and working out (well, trying to workout).

**Q: Who was/is your role model and/or leadership mentor?**

A: Jessica Johnson, my teams’ fearless leader! She has so much knowledge and takes the time to help you grow in your role, which at times bleeds into personal growth. Not sure what my experience here would be like working under someone else, and I’m in no rush to find out.

**Q: What piece of advice would you like to give your younger self?**

A: You’re smarter than you give yourself credit for. Speak up and show people what you got!!
