# Autumn Red Wine Beef Stew Paired with Artist Series Sonata

Prep Time - 30 minutes | Time To Make - 2 hours 30 minutes 

As the weather cools and the leaves begin to fall, there’s nothing quite like a warm, hearty beef stew to bring comfort to your table. This Autumn Red Wine Beef Stew, by Kris Dovbniak, is simmered with rich vegetables, tender beef, and infused with the depth of our Artist Series Sonata. The bold yet elegant notes of the wine elevate the savory flavors of the stew, while the fresh herbs and seasonal vegetables like butternut squash and potatoes add layers of warmth and complexity. It’s the perfect dish to enjoy with a glass of Sonata for a cozy fall evening. 

## Ingredients

2 lb stew beef, cut into bite-sized pieces

## Instructions

1

Prepare the Beef: Remove the beef from the fridge about 10 minutes before cooking to bring it closer to room temperature. Pat it dry with paper towels and season generously with kosher salt and cracked pepper. Toss the beef in flour just before cooking, coating it evenly. 

2

Sear the Beef: Heat a drizzle of neutral oil in a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium-high heat. Working in two batches to avoid overcrowding, sear the beef until browned on all sides, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove the beef from the pot and set aside. 

3

Cook the Vegetables: In the same pot, add a little more oil if needed and toss in the onion, celery, and carrots. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook for 4-5 minutes until the vegetables begin to soften and the onions turn translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another 10-20 seconds until fragrant. 

4

Deglaze with Wine: Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 30 seconds, allowing it to deepen in flavor. Pour in the red wine and bring the mixture to a simmer, using a wooden spoon to scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Let the wine reduce for about 5 minutes. 

5

Simmer the Stew: Pour in the beef broth and bring it to a gentle simmer. Return the seared beef to the pot along with the potatoes, butternut squash, 1/2 tsp sea salt, fresh thyme leaves, rosemary sprig, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf. Stir to combine. 

6

Cook Low and Slow: Cover the pot and cook the stew over low heat for 1 1/2 to 2 hours on the stovetop, or transfer the pot to a preheated 325°F oven and cook for 2–2 1/2 hours, until the beef is tender. 

7

Add the Green Beans: Remove the lid and bring the stew back to a simmer. Stir in the green beans and cook uncovered for an additional 4-5 minutes until they are tender. If the stew is too brothy, simmer for another 3-4 minutes to thicken. Season to taste with additional salt and pepper. 

8

Serve: Ladle the stew into bowls and serve hot. Pair it with a glass of Aly’s Pinot Noir for a perfectly cozy autumn meal.
