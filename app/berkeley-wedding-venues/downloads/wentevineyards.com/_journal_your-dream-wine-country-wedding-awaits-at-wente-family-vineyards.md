One of the highlights of hosting a winery wedding in Livermore Valley is the chance to showcase Wente’s award-winning wines. Selecting the right wines for your wedding day adds a signature touch to your celebration and Wente’s team is here to help with expert pairing advice.

Start your celebration with Sparkling Brut for toasts and light bites. Serve Louis Mel Sauvignon Blanc or Morning Fog Chardonnay with salads and seafood, and move into richer whites like Riva Ranch Chardonnay or reds like Riva Ranch Pinot Noir and Southern Hills Cabernet Sauvignon for main courses. For warm weather weddings or seafood menus, Niki’s Pinot Noir Rosé is a crisp and refreshing favorite.
