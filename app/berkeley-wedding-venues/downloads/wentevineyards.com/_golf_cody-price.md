## Cody Price

General Manager

Cody was first introduced to the game of golf at a young age and quickly turned the hobby into his passion and, eventually, his career. He attended California Lutheran University, where he played on the golf team and earned his bachelor’s degree in business administration. He then completed a two-year certification in Turfgrass Management through Penn State University. Cody has been with The Course at Wente Vineyards since 2016 and resides in San Ramon with his wife, Alyssa, son Brooks, and dog Rummy.
