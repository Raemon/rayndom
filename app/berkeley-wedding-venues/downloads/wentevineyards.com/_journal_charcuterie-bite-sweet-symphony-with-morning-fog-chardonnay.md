# Charcuterie Bite: Sweet Symphony with Morning Fog Chardonnay

This elegant pairing highlights the harmony of flavor and texture. Columbus Genoa Salame or Secchi offers a savory backbone that contrasts beautifully with the buttery richness of triple crème brie. A dab of fig spread adds depth and sweetness, while a fresh strawberry slice brightens the bite with natural acidity. Finish with a Columbus candied pecan for the perfect crunch—an indulgent match to the mild oak and smooth finish of Morning Fog Chardonnay.
