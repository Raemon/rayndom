# 2024 Riva Ranch Chardonnay

This lush Chardonnay has plenty of character and is loaded with perfectly ripened apples, caramelized pineapple, and toasted brioche, which team together to form the foundation of this deep and delightfully expressive vineyard selection. The optimally ripened fruit is complemented by a tasteful measure of slightly creamy oak that hints at notes of crème Brule, along with a dollop of buttery richness that lasts well into the lengthy finish. The mouthfeel is slightly viscous and supple on entry, but manages to maintain youthful energy thanks to some carefully integrated supporting acidity that assures that the wine is as carefully balanced as it is wonderfully rich.

##  Tasting Notes 

The 2024 Riva Ranch Chardonnay opens with vibrant aromas of ripe Honeycrisp apples, fresh Bartlett pears, and toasted brioche, offering an inviting and expressive nose. On the palate, the welldeveloped fruit character is layered with a touch of creamy oak, revealing subtle notes of crème brûlée and a generous hint of buttery richness that extends through a long, elegant finish. A slightly viscous and supple mouthfeel is lifted by refreshing, wellintegrated acidity, bringing both balance and energy to this richly textured, beautifully crafted wine.
