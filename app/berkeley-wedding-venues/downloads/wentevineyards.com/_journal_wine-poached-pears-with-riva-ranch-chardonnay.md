## Ingredients

### For the Pears

4 firm but ripe pears (Bosc or Anjou work best) 

2 cups Wente Family Vineyards Riva Ranch Chardonnay 

½ cup granulated sugar (adjust to taste) 

1 cup water 

1 vanilla bean, split and scraped (or 1 tsp vanilla extract) 

Zest of 1 lemon (wide strips, no pith) 

1 cinnamon stick 

2–3 sprigs fresh thyme (optional, but lovely with Chardonnay) 

Pinch of kosher salt

### Optional for Serving

Mascarpone or crème fraîche 

Toasted almonds or hazelnuts

## Instructions

1

Prepare the pears Peel the pears, leaving the stems intact for an elegant presentation. Slice a thin piece off the bottom of each pear so they stand upright. 

2

Make the poaching liquid In a wide saucepan, combine the Chardonnay, water, sugar, vanilla bean and seeds, lemon zest, cinnamon stick, thyme, and salt. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. 

3

Poach the pears Carefully place the pears in the simmering liquid. Reduce the heat to low, cover partially, and gently poach for 20–30 minutes, turning occasionally, until the pears are tender but not mushy. A knife should slide in easily. 

4

Cool and infuse Remove the pan from heat and let the pears cool in the liquid for at least 30 minutes. For deeper flavor, refrigerate overnight—this allows the pears to fully absorb the Chardonnay and spice notes.

5

Reduce the syrup (optional but recommended) Remove the pears and strain the poaching liquid. Return the liquid to the saucepan and simmer until reduced by half and slightly syrupy.

6

Serve Place the pears upright on plates, spoon the warm Chardonnay syrup over them, and finish with mascarpone, toasted nuts, or a drizzle of honey.
