[ 2024 Morning Fog Chardonnay ](/product/wv-morning-fog-chardonnay-2024)

The Morning Fog Chardonnay stands as the cornerstone of the Wente Chardonnay portfolio, and the 2024 vintage proudly upholds this legacy. Subtle oak nuances of sweet cream and vanilla integrate effortlessly with the bright character of crisp Gala apple, underpinned by hints of fresh-cut pear and lemon curd. On the palate, the wine offers the hallmark weight and depth of classic Chardonnay, balanced by a refined acidity that brings a modest richness while preserving it svibrant, fruit-driven freshness.

[ 2022 Baily Hill Pinot Noir ](/product/2022-baily-hill-pinot-noir)

The 2022 Baily Hill Pinot Noir is a bright and fruit forward example of cool coastal growing. This year’s bottling offers up youthful aromas of Bing cherries and ripe strawberries that are seamlessly combined with a delicate layer of dark soils, sage, and smoked nuts. Supple and silky tannins combined with modest acidity keep the wine in perfect balance from start to lingering finish.

[ 2024 Riva Ranch Chardonnay ](/product/wv-riva-ranch-chardonnay-2024)

This lush Chardonnay has plenty of character and is loaded with perfectly ripened apples, caramelized pineapple, and toasted brioche, which team together to form the foundation of this deep and delightfully expressive vineyard selection. The optimally ripened fruit is complemented by a tasteful measure of slightly creamy oak that hints at notes of crème Brule, along with a dollop of buttery richness that lasts well into the lengthy finish. The mouthfeel is slightly viscous and supple on entry, but manages to maintain youthful energy thanks to some carefully integrated supporting acidity that assures that the wine is as carefully balanced as it is wonderfully rich.
