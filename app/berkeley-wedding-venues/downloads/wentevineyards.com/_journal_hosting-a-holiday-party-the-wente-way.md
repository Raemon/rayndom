# Hosting a Holiday Party the Wente Way

#  Hosting a Holiday Party the Wente Way 

The holidays have a way of making every gathering feel a little extra magical, from the warm glow of candles, the smell of comforting seasonal dishes roasting in the oven, or the clink of the “special” wine glasses filled with great wine. At Wente Family Vineyards, we love keeping holiday entertaining simple but elegant with just a few thoughtful touches, a beautiful table, and timeless wines everyone will enjoy.

If you want to host a celebration that’s cozy and easygoing, yet also refined, here’s how to bring a bit of the vineyard into your home this season.

## 

Bring the Vineyard to the Table

The dinner table is the heart of any holiday party, and it’s not difficult to create a simple yet elevated and festive holiday dinner table setting. Start with soft, neutral linens like cream, ivory, or a muted sage, and pair it with natural yet unexpected textures like wooden candleholders or woven placemats – touches that can easily create an inviting, vineyard-esque backdrop. Other small touches like sprigs of rosemary, pinecones, or (in our case, especially!) grapevine clippings, give a nod to the season without feeling too overdone.

You can consider arranging a few smaller candles and bottles of Wente’s [**Brut Sparkling Wine**](https://wentevineyards.com/collection/all-wine/?wine_type=Sparkling) in the center for a warm glow. The combination of all of these elements will add to that sparkle that makes your table feel festive and magical for your dinner guests. Another fun idea we love is placing longer stem candles in empty wine bottles. Surround the wine bottle candles with some garland strewn across the table, and voila! Your simple yet sophisticated holiday dinner table is complete!

Easy Dishes for Seamless Wine Pairings

With everything else to busy ourselves with during the holidays, entertaining shouldn’t be stressful. That’s why simple, elegant recipes are key, and our family has mastered a few special holiday dishes. For a fresh, light starter, our recipe for [Festive Skewers](https://wentevineyards.com/journal/festive-mozzarella-cherry-tomato-olive-skewers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) featuring mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, and olives are a great option, and pair particularly well with the [**2024 Louis Mel Sauvignon Blanc**](https://wentevineyards.com/product/2024-louis-mel-sauvignon-blanc/), a youthful wine with vibrant acidity and notes of guava, apricot, and citrus. For something a little more indulgent, [Pan Seared Scallops with Citrus & Shallot Butter](https://wentevineyards.com/journal/pan-seared-scallops-with-citrus-shallot-butter/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) perfectly complement the bright, balanced flavors of Wente’s [**2024** **Morning Fog Chardonnay**](https://wentevineyards.com/product/wv-morning-fog-chardonnay-2024/).

Gourmet (yet totally approachable, shh!) appetizers from our recipe rolodex like [Prosciutto-Wrapped Dates with Blue Cheese](https://wentevineyards.com/journal/prosciutto-wrapped-pears-with-blue-cheese/) or a showstopping main course like the [Lemon Pepper Roasted Chicken](https://wentevineyards.com/journal/lemon-pepper-roasted-chicken/) are ideal with [**2022** **Wetmore Cabernet Sauvignon**](https://wentevineyards.com/product/2022-wetmore-cabernet-sauvignon/) or the [**2022** **Cabernet Franc**](https://wentevineyards.com/product/2022-cabernet-franc/).

A Cozy Winter Wine Cocktail

Every holiday gathering feels extra special with a warm (and warming!) cocktail. One of our personal favorites is the [Mulled Wine](https://wentevineyards.com/journal/mulled-wine/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) recipe using the [**2022 Mount Diablo Highlands Red Blend**](https://wentevineyards.com/product/2022-mount-diablo-highlands-red-blend/), with cranberry juice, orange slices, cinnamon sticks, and a few star anise. To really impress, serve the mulled wine in heatproof glasses with a rosemary sprig or cranberries as garnishes for an extra touch of holiday flair.

###  Wrap It All Up with a Perfect Holiday Playlist

The secret sauce of any good holiday party is the perfect playlist and during the holidays, the Wente family home is filled with festive music. Our ideal holiday playlist is one curated of the holiday classics, and some of our personal family favorites, like Dean Martin’s “Let It Snow,” Brenda Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree,” or “Winter Wonderland” by Bing Crosby, all of which you can pull from our curated “Holiday At Wente” [playlist on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/36LaSjOA5Nvp3nKLUh3Dff?si=Ha-yTcalTeyA6sXhsY6eNA&nd=1&dlsi=c36dd32463b2483c) for your easy listening. A thoughtful playlist can wrap the room in warmth and set the pace for your holiday gathering.

###  Hosting the Wente Way

Holiday entertaining is about creating moments that feel intentional yet effortless. Beautiful table settings, easy-to-make recipes, thoughtfully paired wines, and festive touches make your gathering cozy, inviting, and memorable. Whether an intimate dinner with family or a festive wine evening with friends, hosting the Wente Family Vineyards way brings the spirit of Livermore Valley wine country and our vineyard right into your home this holiday season.

And from all of us here at Wente Family Vineyards, we wish you and your loved ones a happy holiday season!
