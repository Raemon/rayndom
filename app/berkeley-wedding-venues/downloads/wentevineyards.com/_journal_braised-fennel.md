# Braised Fennel with Crispy Leeks, Hummus, Shallot & Chili Oil

Prep Time - 5 minutes | Time To Make - 1 hour 

Tender and sweet braised fennel with crispy leeks with hummus is a beautiful and festive side dish or appetizer for Friendsgiving. This recipe is infused with our 2021Aly’s Pinot Noir, which has a touch of oak that frames its layers of red fruit and rose petals. The vibrant acidity and notes of red cherry and vanilla are delightful this time of year and works beautifully with this appetizer. 

## Ingredients

4 leeks, sliced into thin 5- to 6-inch strips

¼ cup olive oil

1½ teaspoons salt, divided

⅓ cup unsalted butter

4 fennel bulbs, quartered into wedges

4 shallots, halved lengthwise

¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

8 roasted garlic cloves

¼ cup 2021 Aly’s Pinot Noir

1 cup chicken stock (or vegetable)

2 8-ounce containers hummus

1-3 tablespoons chili oil

½ cup pine nuts, toasted

## Instructions

1

Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2

Arrange the leeks on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with the oil and ¾ teaspoon salt. Roast for 15 to 20 minutes, until browned and sizzling. Remove from oven and set aside, tented with foil to keep warm.

3

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add the fennel cut side down. Add the shallots, cut side down, nestled between the fennel.

4

Sprinkle with the remaining ¾ teaspoon salt and the pepper. Add the garlic. Cover and cook over medium heat with a steady light sizzle for 4 minutes.

5

Flip the fennel and shallots. Cook, uncovered for another 3 to 4 minutes.

6

Add the wine to deglaze the pan without stirring.

7

Add the stock and bring to a strong simmer. Cover and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the fennel is fork-tender.

8

Uncover the skillet, increase the heat to medium, and let the liquid reduce for 20 to 30 minutes.

9

To serve, spread a generous layer of hummus on a large serving platter. Top with the braised fennel, shallots, and leeks. Drizzle with chili oil lightly and top with pine nuts. Enjoy!
