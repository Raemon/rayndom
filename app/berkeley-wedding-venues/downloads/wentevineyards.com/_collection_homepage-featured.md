[ 2024 Riva Ranch Chardonnay ](/product/wv-riva-ranch-chardonnay-2024)

This lush Chardonnay has plenty of character and is loaded with perfectly ripened apples, caramelized pineapple, and toasted brioche, which team together to form the foundation of this deep and delightfully expressive vineyard selection. The optimally ripened fruit is complemented by a tasteful measure of slightly creamy oak that hints at notes of crème Brule, along with a dollop of buttery richness that lasts well into the lengthy finish. The mouthfeel is slightly viscous and supple on entry, but manages to maintain youthful energy thanks to some carefully integrated supporting acidity that assures that the wine is as carefully balanced as it is wonderfully rich.

[ 2022 Livermore Valley Wetmore Cabernet Sauvignon ](/product/2022-wetmore-cabernet-sauvignon)

The 2022 Livermore Valley Wetmore Cabernet Sauvignon opens with aromas of black currant and cassis, complemented by a hint of "Livermore Dust." Creamy oak notes bring roasted cocoa nibs and hardwood complexity. On the palate, the wine offers layers of ripe black cherry and plum, leading to a long, satisfying finish. While initially supple, it transitions into a deep, rich profile with a firm tannin structure that will support its aging potential. *Cannot be shipped to Louisiana.

[ 2024 Wente Clone Chardonnay ](/product/2024-wente-clone-chardonnay)

The Wente Clone Chardonnay is a limited-production release that is sourced from our Ernest and Eric Ranches, where the Wente family’s original heritage vines continue to thrive. It showcases the purity and character of the historic Wente Clone—layered with aromas of ripe green apple, pear, and citrus, and a palate that unfolds with apricot, minerality, and subtle creamy French oak. An expression of place and legacy, it honors the craftsmanship that helped shape California Chardonnay.
