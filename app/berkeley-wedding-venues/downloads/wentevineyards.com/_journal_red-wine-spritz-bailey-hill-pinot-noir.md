# Simple Red Wine Spritz Featuring Baily Hill Pinot Noir

As the last days of summer give way to the crisp beginnings of fall, there’s no better way to celebrate the changing seasons than with a Simple Red Wine Spritz. Our Baily Hill Pinot Noir, with its light, fruit-forward profile, is the perfect base for this refreshing spritz that effortlessly bridges summer’s warmth and autumn’s cool embrace. This easy-to-make spritz combines the vibrant flavors of Baily Hill Pinot Noir with the bold, bittersweet notes of Campari and the effervescence of sparkling water. It’s a delightful aperitivo that captures the essence of both seasons. 

## Ingredients

1 glass of Baily Hill Pinot Noir
