# Women Behind Wente

#  Women Behind Wente 

At Wente Vineyards, we are fortunate to have strong women leadership throughout many branches of our organization. Since 1977, women have had a voice and seat at the table – driving key decision making and growing Wente Vineyards to what it is today.

Wente Vineyards is proud to support Dress for Success in their mission to empower women in communities worldwide to thrive in work and in life. In 2023, Wente Vineyards has donated $10,000 to Dress For Success. Help match our donation and learn more about this important organization below.
