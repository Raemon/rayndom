# Summer Events at Wente Family Vineyards

#  2025 Summer Events 

Summer is officially here, and its warm days bring new experiences and offerings at Wente Family Vineyards. We’d love to welcome you to the Wente Family Vineyards Tasting Lounge for a memorable wine tasting—or to see you at one of our summer events happening throughout the season.

Summer in Livermore Valley usually means warm days and cool nights. The temperatures are perfect for our grapes which are busy ripening and developing fruit flavors. The San Francisco Bay brings cooling winds in the morning and night, so be sure to bring layers if you join us at night.

We are located just East of San Francisco and in the heart of one of the most accessible wine countries to visit. So whether you are biking, hiking, or taking BART or Lyft, we hope to see you at Wente Family Vineyards this summer.

Below are seven ways to savor the summer season with Wente Family Vineyards.

  1. Summer Live Music Series
  2. Country Concerts in July
  3. Summer Sunset Dinners
  4. Swing Sip Barbeque Series
  5. Movie Nights Under the Stars
  6. Terroir to Table: Wine & Food Pairing Experience at Murrieta’s Well Winery
  7. Dog Day Afternoon
