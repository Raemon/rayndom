An elegant, earthy dish that pairs perfectly with Wente Family Vineyards Baily Hill Pinot Noir. If you’re looking for the ultimate comfort-meets-luxury dish, this Creamy Black Truffle & Mushroom Risotto delivers. Earthy shiitake and portabella mushrooms meet silky Arborio rice, rich Parmesan, and fragrant black truffle for a recipe that feels indulgent yet approachable — especially when paired with a glass of Wente Baily Hill Pinot Noir. This restaurant-quality risotto is a show-stopping choice for a holiday dinner, date night, or special celebration. The creamy texture complements Baily Hill Pinot Noir’s bright acidity, while the truffle and mushrooms mirror the wine’s earthy, red-fruit character — creating a truly balanced pairing from the first bite to the last sip.

## Instructions

1

Sauté the Mushrooms Heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant. Add mushrooms, thyme, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook 7–8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden and tender. Remove from pan and set aside. 

2

Build the Risotto Base In the same pan (or heavy pot), melt butter with olive oil. Add shallots and garlic; cook 2–3 minutes until softened. Stir in Arborio rice and toast for 2 minutes until slightly translucent. Pour in white wine, stirring until absorbed. Add hot stock ½ cup at a time, stirring often. Continue for 18–20 minutes until rice is creamy yet al dente. 

3

Finish & Serve Stir cooked mushrooms back into the risotto. Add Parmesan, butter, and parsley. Cover for 1–2 minutes. Stir gently until silky and glossy. Drizzle with truffle oil, season to taste, and top with shaved truffle. 💡 Pro Tip: Risotto should softly spread when plated. If too thick, stir in a splash of warm stock before serving.
