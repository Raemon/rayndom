# 2024 Riva Ranch Riesling

The 2024 Riva Ranch Riesling bursts with lively fruit character and delicate floral aromatics. Fragrant notes of honeysuckle and orange blossom lead the bouquet, layered with juicy white peach, apricot, and a touch of honeyed richness. On the palate, crisp pear and apple introduce a subtle sweetness at the core, balanced beautifully by a refreshing lift of acidity. This harmonious interplay results in a vibrant, fruit-forward wine with energy and finesse throughout. 

Complimentary Ground Shipping on 6+ Bottles.
