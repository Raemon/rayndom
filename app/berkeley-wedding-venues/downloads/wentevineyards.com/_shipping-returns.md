##  Shipping & Returns

All purchases and transactions for the sale of wine, goods, or services made through the Website, by phone, or visits, are governed by this Shipping & Returns section and our Terms and Conditions of Sale, which are hereby incorporated into these [terms of use](https://wentevineyards.com/terms).

Additional terms and conditions may also apply to specific portions, services, or features of the Website.

**HOLIDAY SHIPPING DEADLINES**

Order wines by the dates below to ensure holiday delivery.

  * 11/18 – Thanksgiving
  * 12/16 – Christmas
  * 12/13 – New Year’s



**CANCELLED ORDERS**

If an order has not left our warehouse, we will work with you to cancel the order and process a refund. This will be managed by our concierge team call us at (925) 456-2305 or email us at [concierge@wentevineyards.com](mailto:concierge@wentevineyards.com).

Shipping and handling charges are non-refundable.

By placing your order, you agree to the best of your knowledge that you are aware of the product and/or service you are purchasing, and that it is not being done in/with error, or without your consent.

**DAMAGED OR FLAWED WINES**

Your satisfaction is our top priority. Please contact our Concierge department if you received wines that are damaged or flawed. We will replace wine that is damaged or flawed that was purchased directly from our winery- by phone, in person, or wentevineyards.com. If you feel you have opened an unsatisfactory bottle, please save the contents, and call us at (925) 456-2305 or email us at [concierge@wentevineyards.com](mailto:concierge@wentevineyards.com)

We cannot accept returns of alcoholic beverages unless the products are corked or flawed. We are unable to replace wine or issue a refund that was damaged due to adverse weather conditions during shipment.

Weather damage may include leakage, freezing, and/or corks pushing. Please be sure to check the shipping destination weather conditions before placing your order and select a later ship date if necessary.

Wines purchased through retailers must be returned to them.

**SHIPPING & DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS**

Federal law requires a signature be obtained from an individual over the age of 21 for all wine shipments. Notes with a signature left for the delivery companies cannot be accepted as a replacement for an individual signing for the shipment. By placing your order, you represent to us that you are at least 21 years old and that the person to whom delivery will be made is at least 21 years old. When your wine is delivered, the person receiving delivery may be required to show identification.

We cannot guarantee the condition of any wine if delivery is not made on the first delivery attempt. Orders that are not delivered on the initial attempt may be held in a facility that is not temperature controlled. Upon the third missed delivery attempt, orders will be held for up to five (5) business days and if not picked up, your shipment will be returned to our warehouse. To claim wine at a UPS location, identification with the name of the recipient and tracking number must be shown. Federal law prohibits change of delivery address during transit and the order must be returned to the sender for re-shipment. Additional shipping charges may apply.

If your wine is returned to our warehouse, you will need to contact our Concierge team to setup a new order. Call us at (925) 456-2305 or email us at concierge@wentevineyards.com

**SHIPPING INFORMATION**

Our shipping rates are based on the weight of the individual package and where the package is to be delivered. For a personalized quote, please call us at (925) 456-2305 or email us at [concierge@wentevineyards.com](mailto:concierge@wentevineyards.com). You may also enter your zip code at checkout on our website to see the final shipping rates.

**PICKUP**

Orders can be placed via the website or phone and then picked up at the winery. Your order is ready for pickup during our regular business hours and once you have received your order confirmation. Please select ‘pickup’ as your shipping preference for checkout on our website. We appreciate 24 hours to process your order before pickup.

##  Riva Diva Merchandise Orders

### Order Confirmation

You’ll receive an email confirmation from our merch partner, Printful, as soon as your order is placed.

### Made To Order

Each item is made-to-order, embroidered specifically for you to ensure quality and reduce waste.

### Processing Time 

Production typically takes 3–7 business days before shipping. During holidays, it may take a bit longer.

### Shipping & Tracking

Once your order ships, you’ll receive a tracking email directly from Printful. All merchandise ships separately from wine orders.

### Separate Checkout & Support

Because this order is handled through our Printful store, it won’t appear in your Wente order history or cart. Additionally, we are unable to process both wine and Riva Diva merchandise orders together.

### Returns & Exchanges 

We’re only able to replace items that arrive damaged or misprinted. If this happens, send us a photo and your order number — we’ll make it right.

### Questions About Your Order?

For order updates or product concerns, contact our concierge team at [concierge@wentevineyatds.com](mailto:concierge@wentevineyatds.com), and we’ll coordinate directly with Printful on your behalf.
