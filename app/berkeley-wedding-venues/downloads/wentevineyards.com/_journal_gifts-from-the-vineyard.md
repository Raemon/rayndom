###  Wente’s Guide to Holiday Wine Gifting

Here at Wente Family Vineyards, gift-giving is rooted in the same traditions that define our winemaking – generosity, craftsmanship, and the joy of bringing people together. As America’s longest continuously operated, family-owned winery, the Wente family has celebrated more than 140 holiday seasons in Livermore Valley wine country, carrying forward timeless rituals that inspire the gifts we share today.

## 

Holiday Gifting the Wente Way

Each year, our family leans into simple but heartfelt gestures, from surprising one another with Secret Santa gifts, dressing in our finest attire to honor our grandmother’s belief that the holidays should always feel elegant, and sharing our favorite wines over homemade pies.

Inspired by these traditions, our historic vineyards enable us to offer a collection of [holiday wine gifts](/holiday-gift-guide/) and accessories designed to bring the warmth of California’s wine country to you, wherever your home may be.

The best [wine gift ideas](/holiday-gift-guide/) are thoughtful and customizable, because every wine lover in your life deserves something selected just for them. We think our[ Wine Gift Sets](/collection/gifting/) are the perfect place to start – curated selections of estate-grown wines, thoughtfully boxed and ready to give. From bright whites and expressive reds to seasonal bundles and limited-edition releases, these sets make hosting and celebrating effortless. Many include great options for the more budget-minded, falling within the range of best wine gifts under $100, making it easy to pick something exceptional without overthinking.

## 

The Best Gifts Are the Ones You Share

For the Wente family, the true spirit of the season lies in time spent together. We cherish everything from big family gatherings to our traditional Christmas morning walk on the 18-hole Championship golf course that’s right on our property.

There is nothing more meaningful than shared experiences, which is why our vineyard [**experiences**](https://wentevineyards.com/visit/#gift-an-experience) make such memorable gifts. From guided tastings to immersive culinary pairings, each one is designed to be enjoyed together. A[ **wine club****gift membership**](https://wentevineyards.com/wine-clubs/#gift-membership) extends that joy throughout the year, delivering handcrafted wines and member perks season after season – something you and your loved ones can enjoy together.

And for family and friends who live a little too far away to celebrate in person, [**eGift Cards**](https://wentevineyards.com/product/egift) offer a flexible way to send some vinous love across the miles. Recipients can choose their favorite bottles or plan an on-site tasting or vineyard experience for a future visit.

###  The Spirit of the Season

Our Wente family (and extended Wente family!) believes the best gifts are the ones that bring people together. From shared food around the table, a moment carved out for a tasting, or a thoughtful gesture that makes someone feel seen, each offering from the vineyard is created with that spirit in mind, honoring five generations of craftsmanship and the joy of giving.
