# Spiced Cranberry Sangria with Wetmore Cabernet Sauvignon

At Wente Family Vineyards, the holidays are a season of gathering. Whether you’re hosting a festive cocktail party or settling into a cozy night at home, the right wine cocktail can turn an ordinary evening into something worth savoring. This Spiced Cranberry Sangria brings together bold, fruit-forward Cabernet Sauvignon with winter aromatics of star anise, cinnamon, clove, and ginger, for a cocktail that tastes like the season in a glass. The backbone of the recipe is our Wetmore Cabernet Sauvignon, an estate wine shaped by the history and terroir of Livermore Valley. Its richness and depth beautifully balance tart cranberry and warm spice, creating a sangria that is both bright and comforting. Serve it with holiday appetizers, reserve it for your signature welcome cocktail, or pour a glass by the fire while trimming the tree.

## **Why It Works: The Cabernet Connection**

Cabernet Sauvignon brings structure and richness to this sangria, something lighter reds can’t always deliver. Our **Wetmore Cabernet Sauvignon** is known for its dark berry fruit, velvety tannins, and subtle oak spice, all of which accent the cranberry and warm winter aromatics beautifully.

Expect notes of:

  * **Black cherry and cassis**

  * **Baking spice and cocoa**

  * **Soft oak and a smooth, lingering finish**




The result is balanced, festive, and unmistakably Wintry.

## **Hosting Tip**

Make a batch of the winter spice syrup in advance and serve your sangria in a pitcher for effortless entertaining. Add garnishes just before serving to infuse aromatics and give each glass a festive finishing touch.
