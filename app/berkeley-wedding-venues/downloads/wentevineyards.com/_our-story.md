## 1883

C.H. Wente, a German immigrant, establishes Wente Vineyards in California’s Livermore Valley after learning the art of winemaking from Charles Krug. Drawn to the region’s agricultural promise and strategic proximity to the San Francisco Bay and transcontinental railroad, C.H. lays the foundation for what will become America’s longest continuously family-owned and operated winery.

### The Beginning of a Legacy

## 1912

Second-generation vintner Ernest Wente partners with UC Davis professor Leon Bonet to import fine wine grape cuttings from France, including what would become the Wente Clone of Chardonnay. These vines, planted in Livermore Valley and at UC Davis, would ultimately shape the future of California Chardonnay.

### Chardonnay Takes Root

## 1933

The Wente family remained resilient when Prohibition threatened to dismantle California’s premium wine industry. They diversified their business, expanding into cattle ranching and other agricultural ventures, while continuing to produce wine for sacramental and medicinal purposes legally. Through strategic adaptation and hard work, the family never missed a vintage, preserving the integrity of their vineyards and laying the groundwork for post-Prohibition recovery.

### Surviving Prohibition and Innovating Forward 

## 1936

Following Prohibition, the Wente family reemerges with a focus on quality. Ernest and his brother Herman Wente begin varietally labeling wines—starting with Sauvignon Blanc under the Valle de Oro label in 1932 and then Pinot Chardonnay in 1936—pioneering a practice that would become the standard for premium California wines.

### First California Chardonnay Label 

## 1939

Wente’s Sauvignon Blanc earns a Grand Prize at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition. The recognition reinforces the family’s commitment to crafting premium wines and brings international attention to Livermore Valley as a world-class winegrowing region.

### Modernization & Expansion 

## 1962

In 1962, Wente family purchased land in Arroyo Seco, Monterey County—becoming the first to plant vineyards in the region. These cool-climate vineyards produce distinctive varieties, including Grey Riesling (now identified as Trousseau Gris).
