# 2022 Southern Hills Cabernet Sauvignon

Our Southern Hills Cabernet Sauvignon is named for our vineyards located along the southern hills of the Central Coast. The Wente family farms approximately 400 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards using the two clones originating from California wine pioneer Charles Wetmore’s Bordeaux cuttings in the 19th century. With well-drained rocky soils and unique microclimates, the Southern Hills vineyards are in the most desirable settings, with exposures ideal for growing Cabernet Sauvignon of distinct character, depth, and intensity.

##  Tasting Notes 

The 2022 Wente Vineyards Southern Hills Cabernet Sauvignon sets a high standard for balance and value. It opens with vibrant notes of blackberries, cassis, and black cherry, complemented by subtle oak flavors of cocoa and a touch of fresh-baked gingerbread. The wine is well-balanced and polished, making it approachable for immediate enjoyment, yet its depth and structure suggest it will age gracefully over the next three to five years.
