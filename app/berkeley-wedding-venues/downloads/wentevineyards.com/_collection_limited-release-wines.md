Our 2021 Small Lot Zinfandel is full of sweet oak flavors that play a significant role in the wine's character but not one that overshadows its deep and generous fruit profile. Dark chocolate, nutmeg, and dried fig are prominent in the aroma profile alongside rich and expressive Zinfandel fruit. Jammy boysenberry and ripe plum form the core of the palate with supporting notes of black pepper and spice.

Jammy blackberry and fig form the core of the palate along with supporting notes of black pepper and spice. Deeply filled with vibrant acidity and a firm spine of tannins, this wine offers up enough balance for indulgent early drinking but also plenty of fruity depth and structure to justify laying a few aside to explore its aging potential.
