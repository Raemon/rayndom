# Pan Seared Scallops with Citrus & Shallot Butter

Prep Time - 5 minutes | Time To Make - 15 minutes 

Seared scallops are a wonderful mild, buttery pairing with our 2022 Morning Fog Chardonnay, a wine with a citrusy aroma and notes of green apple complemented by hints of toasty oak and vanilla from barrel-aging. This wine is balanced by a lingering minerality and natural acidity that highlights the seafood’s natural sweetness. This recipe comes together quickly and will be an impressive meal for a night in or entertaining.

## Instructions

1

Rinse the scallops and remove the side muscles if attached. Pat dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.

2

For the citrus and shallot butter, melt the stick of butter in a large cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Add the shallots, stir, and cook until softened about 2 minutes. Add the chardonnay, stir, and cook for another minute. Remove from the heat and cool for 2 minutes.

3

While whisking the butter mixture, slowly pour in the orange juice until combined. Cover to keep warm until ready to serve.

4

For the scallops, heat 4 tablespoons butter and the oil in a separate large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add the scallops in a single layer, leaving an inch of space between each. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes without flipping, until a golden crust forms. Flip and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes, until the outside is browned and the scallops are opaque throughout. Transfer to a plate and cover to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining scallops.

5

To serve, pour the warm citrus butter over the scallops. Finish with a squeeze of meyer lemon juice, thyme, citrus wedges, and a touch of flaky sea salt, and a drizzle of olive oil. Enjoy!
