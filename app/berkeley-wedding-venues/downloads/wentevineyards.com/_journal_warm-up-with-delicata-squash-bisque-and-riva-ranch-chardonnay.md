# Warm Up with Delicata Squash Bisque and Riva Ranch Chardonnay 

As the chill of winter sets in, there’s nothing more comforting than a hearty, homemade soup. Our Delicata Squash Bisque brings together seasonal produce and warming flavors, making it the perfect dish for cozy winter nights. This creamy, rich bisque is a celebration of delicata and honey nut squash, roasted to perfection and blended with vegetables for a smooth, velvety finish. Topped with pumpkin seeds and cotija cheese for an extra layer of flavor, this recipe pairs beautifully with our Riva Ranch Chardonnay, enhancing the wine’s crisp apple notes and subtle vanilla undertones. Whether you’re hosting friends or enjoying a quiet night by the fire, this bisque fills your kitchen with the comforting aroma of roasted vegetables and buttery richness. And the best part? The recipe calls for a splash of Chardonnay, so you can sip as you cook! Get ready to indulge in the flavors of the season and savor every spoonful of this perfect winter pairing.

## Instructions

1

Preheat the Oven: Set your oven to 400°F (200°C). Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper. 

2

Halve 2 delicata squash and 1 honey nut squash, scooping out the seeds. Halve 4 Roma tomatoes. Place the squash and tomatoes face-down on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle the squash and tomatoes with 2 tbsp olive oil, then season with salt, pepper, and any preferred spices. 

3

Roast in the oven for 45 minutes, or until soft and caramelized. 

4

While the vegetables roast, heat 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tbsp butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add 2 chopped celery stalks, 2 chopped carrots, and 1 quartered onion. Sauté until softened, about 10 minutes. Add 3–5 garlic cloves, cooking for another 5 minutes until fragrant. 

5

Once the squash and tomatoes are done, carefully remove them from the oven. Add them to the pot with the sautéed aromatics. You can keep the skin on the delicata squash or remove it—both work well. 

6

Pour in half of the vegetable broth (about 2–3 cups) and blend everything with an immersion blender until smooth. If you don’t have an immersion blender, use a standing blender. Be sure to leave the lid off and cover with a towel to let the steam escape. Add more vegetable broth if you prefer a thinner soup. (Use up to 6 cups total.) Optional: For an ultra-smooth texture, strain the bisque through a fine mesh strainer. 

7

Bring the bisque to a gentle simmer over low heat. Stir in 1 cup heavy cream and remove from heat. 

8

Ladle the soup into bowls. Swirl in a bit of extra heavy cream or crème fraîche. Top with cotija cheese and pumpkin seeds for added texture and flavor. 

9

Serve warm with a glass of Riva Ranch Chardonnay for the perfect cozy pairing.
