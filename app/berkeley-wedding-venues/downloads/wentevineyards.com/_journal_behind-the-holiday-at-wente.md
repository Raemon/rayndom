###  Wente Family Holiday Traditions

At Wente Family Vineyards, the holidays are about family, food, and the wines that bring people together. As America’s longest continuously operated, family-owned winery, Wente has been celebrating the season in Livermore Valley wine country for more than 140 years – honoring time-tested holiday wine traditions that combine California warmth with family connection.

For the Wente family, Thanksgiving marks the true beginning of the holidays, a day steeped in gratitude and togetherness.

“We grew up horseback riding on Thanksgiving morning before gathering in the evening. It’s our way of slowing down and appreciating the beauty around us.”

Aly Wente, fifth generation winegrower.

When Aly’s uncle **Eric Wente** hosts, he opens his cellar to showcase rare vintages, lining up a tasting of aged reds and whites for everyone to enjoy, a cherished ritual that transforms the holiday meal into an unforgettable tasting experience.

Meanwhile, the kitchen fills with the aroma of the family’s pie recipes. Every year, the family comes together for “pie day,” rolling out dough for lattice-top apple pies and classic pumpkin – [**family holiday recipes**](/journal/category/recipe/) that have become a centerpiece of their gatherings.

###  Hosting the Wente Way

Entertaining during the holidays is a Wente family specialty, and it always starts with thoughtfully chosen wines. From lively aperitifs to showstopping bottles for the main course, each Wente wine adds a touch of California elegance to any table. Here are a few favorite pairings the family is happy to share:

###  The Spirit of the Season

As the calendar turns to December, the Wente family’s **holiday traditions** continue.

_“Christmas Eve is our big celebration,”_ says Aly Wente. _“We do a Secret Santa exchange and always serve cracked crab – it’s our signature dish.”_ At every seat, my dad leaves a small surprise: a lottery ticket, a playful touch that always sparks laughter.

On **Christmas Day** , after presents and breakfast, the family sometimes sneaks out to [The Course at Wente](/golf/) to walk the golf course with the babies, dogs, and clubs, before settling in for a cozy evening together.

And when dinner is served, the evening takes on an air of timeless charm. _“Our Grandma, who turns 100 this February, has always believed the holidays should feel elegant,”_ Aly shares._“The men wear coats and ties; the women dress up. We do it for her, and now, it’s tradition.”_
