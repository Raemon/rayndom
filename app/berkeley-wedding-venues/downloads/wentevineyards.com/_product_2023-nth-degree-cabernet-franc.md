# 2023 nth DEGREE Cabernet Franc

The inaugural 2023 vintage of n DEGREE Cabernet Franc is a compelling expression of why this variety thrives in the Livermore Valley. The nose entices with layered aromas of red and black cherry, earthy undertones, black pepper, and a touch of spicy French oak. On the palate, it offers a rich yet balanced mouthfeel, with a moderate body and a refined tannin structure that carries gracefully through a long, elegant finish.

### Fermentation And Aging

Fermentation took place in small stainless steel tanks, with twice-daily pneumatage to gently extract the wine’s vibrant aromatics and nuanced flavors. The wine was then aged for twenty months in a combination of 50% new and 50% second-use French oak barrels, adding layers of complexity while preserving the fruit's purity.
