# White Wine Sangria Featuring Louis Mel Sauvignon Blanc 

Prep Time - 10 minutes | Time To Make - 10 minutes 

At Wente Vineyards, we cherish the moments that bring us together, especially as we savor the final days of summer. As the season winds down, there’s no better way to celebrate than with a refreshing White Wine Sangria made with our Louis Mel Sauvignon Blanc. With its juicy acidity, notes of Meyer lemon, and candied citrus, this versatile wine is the ideal base for a sangria that bursts with vibrant flavors, perfect for late-summer gatherings. Our Louis Mel Sauvignon Blanc harmonizes beautifully with the citrusy and tropical notes in this sangria, creating a delightful, easy-drinking experience that’s perfect for any occasion. Whether you’re enjoying a backyard barbecue, a sunset picnic, or a relaxing evening with friends, this sangria is sure to elevate your summer celebrations. Feel free to customize it with your favorite fruits, but here’s our recommended recipe to get you started.
