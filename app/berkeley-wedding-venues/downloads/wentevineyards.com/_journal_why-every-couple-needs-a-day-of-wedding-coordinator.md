# Day-of Wedding Coordinator 

###  A Q&A with Erin Russo, Certified Event & Wedding Planner at Allora Event Designs

Planning a wedding at Wente Family Vineyards is an unforgettable journey — golden sunsets over the vines, elegant receptions under the stars, and every detail designed to tell your love story. But behind the beauty of a seamless celebration is a lot of coordination. From managing vendors to handling last-minute surprises, that’s where a trusted day-of wedding coordinator becomes essential.

To shed light on the value of having a planner by your side, we sat down with **Erin Russo** , Certified Event & Wedding Planner and founder of [**Allora Event Designs**](http://www.alloraeventdesigns.com/), one of Wente’s trusted preferred vendors.

## Meet Erin Russo

### Certified Event & Wedding Planner

Planning a wedding or special event can feel overwhelming, but with the right expertise it becomes an enjoyable and stress-free experience. With over 20 years of experience, I bring the knowledge, creativity, and passion needed to bring each couple’s unique vision to life. Whether you’re dreaming of an intimate gathering or a grand celebration, my services are tailored to your style and needs, with careful attention to every detail. Beyond planning events, I love exploring food, traveling, enjoying the outdoors with my rescue dog Ted, and spending time with loved ones. I can’t wait to help create a seamless, memorable celebration that truly reflects your story.

#### _Top Reasons to Hire a Day-of Wedding Coordinator_

**Less Stress, More Joy**  
You deserve to be fully present on your wedding day, soaking up every laugh, every toast, and every dance. A planner handles the details, so you can simply enjoy.

**Expert Guidance**  
Wedding planners know the logistics inside and out. They can foresee potential issues and solve them before they even cross your radar.

**Perfect Timing**  
From the walk down the aisle to the last song of the night, a coordinator ensures your timeline stays on track and stress-free.

**Peace of Mind**  
When you have a seasoned professional managing the details, you can relax knowing you’re in expert hands.

As Erin shares, _“Whether you’re planning an over-the-top celebration or an intimate gathering, a wedding planner brings calm to the chaos — ensuring your day is exactly as you envisioned it would be.”_

#### _Why a Wedding Coordinator Is a Must-Have_

Your wedding day should be about celebrating love, not managing logistics. Erin explains it best: _“Wedding planners are the bridge between inspiration and execution. We’re there to handle vendors, solve problems, and fine-tune the details so couples can focus on what truly matters: celebrating their day surrounded by family and friends.”_

At Wente Family Vineyards, our team works hand-in-hand with planners like Allora to make sure the setting, service, and experience flow beautifully — giving couples the best of both worlds.

#### _How Coordinators Handle the Unexpected_

No matter how much planning goes into a wedding, surprises can happen: a missing boutonniere, a late shuttle, or unexpected weather. Erin and her team are prepared for it all.

_“With a calm mindset and ready-for-anything approach, we anticipate problems before they escalate and jump into action with solutions. Often, couples don’t even realize an issue occurred — and that’s the way it should be,”_ Erin shares.

At Wente, that means you get to enjoy your day to the fullest, while your planner ensures every detail unfolds seamlessly behind the scenes.

Erin’s approach goes beyond logistics: _“What truly sets us apart is our blend of passion, creativity, and an unwavering commitment to our clients. We keep each couple’s unique story and vision at the heart of the planning process, ensuring their day feels personal, intentional, and unforgettable.”_

With Allora, planning isn’t just about executing an event — it’s about building a relationship, easing the journey, and creating memories that last long after the last dance.

## Favorite Wedding Day Moment

When asked about her favorite part of a wedding day, Erin doesn’t hesitate:  _“After months of collaboration, our favorite moment is seeing all the planning come to life. There’s something truly special about watching our couples soak in their day, knowing every detail is just as they dreamed.”_
