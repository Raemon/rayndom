# Baked Burrata-Stuffed Tomatoes with Balsamic Glaze and Fresh Basil 

Indulge in the flavors of late summer with these Baked Burrata-Stuffed Tomatoes, a simple yet sophisticated dish that celebrates the season’s best produce. Ripe, juicy tomatoes are hollowed out and filled with creamy burrata, then baked to perfection and topped with a drizzle of balsamic glaze, extra virgin olive oil, and fresh basil. This recipe is an effortless way to elevate your appetizer game, making it ideal for both casual gatherings and elegant dinners. For the perfect pairing, we recommend serving this dish with a chilled glass of Wente Vineyards Louis Mel Sauvignon Blanc—the crisp, refreshing notes of the wine beautifully complement the rich flavors of the burrata and tomatoes, creating a delightful harmony on the palate. Whether you’re a seasoned cook or a kitchen novice, this dish is sure to impress with its vibrant flavors and beautiful presentation.

## Instructions

1

Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Drizzle a bit of extra virgin olive oil on the bottom of a baking dish to lightly coat it.

2

Cut the tops off of the tomatoes and gently hollow out the centers, removing the seeds and pulp. Be careful not to puncture the sides. Place one ball of burrata cheese inside each hollowed tomato.

3

Arrange the stuffed tomatoes in the prepared baking dish. Drizzle a little more olive oil over the top of each tomato. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes, or until the tomatoes are tender and the burrata is warmed through.

4

Remove the baking dish from the oven. Season the tomatoes with sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Drizzle with balsamic glaze and a bit more EVOO. Garnish with fresh basil leaves.

5

Serve immediately while the burrata is still warm and gooey. Enjoy as a delicious appetizer or side dish!
