# A Sauvignon Blanc Night In: Shrimp Fra Diavolo with Louis Mel Sauvignon Blanc

Recipe and content by Sophia Dimkopoulos of @sophs.clean.eats | Adapted for Wente Vineyards There’s something timeless about a cozy evening spent in the kitchen, cooking up a favorite pasta dish and pouring a glass of crisp, refreshing wine. At Wente Family Vineyards, we believe those simple pleasures—good food, great wine, and moments shared—are what life is all about. We recently partnered with Sophia Dimkopoulos of @sophs.clean.eats, who brought her signature warmth and wellness-inspired cooking to a night in with our Louis Mel Sauvignon Blanc. This bright, fruit-forward wine with notes of citrus and tropical fruit is the perfect match for Sophia’s homemade Shrimp Fra Diavolo—a dish that delivers bold flavor and just the right amount of spice. Sophia describes Shrimp Fra Diavolo as her go-to order at any Italian restaurant, and her recipe brings that restaurant-quality flavor to your own kitchen. It’s simple, delicious, and elevated by a splash of Sauvignon Blanc right in the sauce. 

## Ingredients

1 large bag shrimp, peeled and deveined 

1 box pasta (whole wheat linguine works beautifully)

3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 

3 garlic cloves, minced 

1 cup Wente Vineyards Louis Mel Sauvignon Blanc 

1 can diced fire-roasted tomatoes 

4 tbsp tomato paste

## Instructions

1

In a large skillet, heat 1 tbsp olive oil over medium heat. 

2

Add shrimp, crushed red pepper, and salt. Sauté for 1 minute (shrimp should be partially cooked), then remove from pan and set aside. 

3

In the same pan, add remaining olive oil, diced onion, and minced garlic. Cook until onions are lightly browned and fragrant. 

4

Pour in the Sauvignon Blanc and let simmer briefly. 

5

Stir in fire-roasted tomatoes and tomato paste. Let the sauce simmer on low until it thickens (about 10 minutes). 

6

Return the shrimp to the pan and allow it to finish cooking in the sauce. 

7

Add cooked pasta and toss to coat evenly. 

8

Garnish with fresh parsley and parmesan flakes. Serve warm with a glass of Louis Mel Sauvignon Blanc.
