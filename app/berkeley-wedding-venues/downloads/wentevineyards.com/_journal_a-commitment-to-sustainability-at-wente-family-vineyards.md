# A Commitment to Sustainability

#  A Commitment to Sustainability 

At Wente Family Vineyards, every day is Earth Day. As the country’s longest continuously family-owned and operated winery, we’ve spent over 140 years cultivating a legacy rooted in sustainable winegrowing and community care in California’s Livermore Valley.

Sustainability isn’t just something we practice—it’s who we are. From regenerative farming to eco-conscious packaging and employee-driven volunteerism, we’re committed to making a positive impact on our land, our people, and our broader community.

###  Certified Sustainable in Vineyard and Winery

Wente Family Vineyards is proud to be among the fewer than 10% of California wineries that are Certified Sustainable in both vineyard and winery operations. This prestigious designation reflects our commitment to high standards in environmental stewardship, resource conservation, and social responsibility. Sustainability has been part of our ethos since our founding in 1883, and our fifth-generation leadership continues to push boundaries to meet—and exceed—industry benchmarks.

###  Regenerative Farming and Vineyard Practices

In our Central Coast estate vineyards, we implement no-till farming to protect soil health and sequester carbon, reducing our environmental footprint. Water conservation is also a top priority, with efficient drip irrigation systems that maximize effectiveness while minimizing waste. We preserve natural habitats, foster biodiversity, and protect the region’s rich ecosystem, because healthy land produces better wine and a better future.

###  Eco-Conscious Winemaking and Packaging

Inside the winery, we’ve adopted innovative water-saving technologies that have saved over 150,000 gallons of water annually. We’re also taking big steps toward carbon footprint reduction through our recent switch to lightweight glass bottles. Our standard bottles now weigh approximately 410 grams, with the Coastal Vineyards Series coming in under 400 grams—about 34% lighter than the previous 620-gram bottles. These changes help us significantly reduce emissions across our supply chain.

###  Supporting People and Community

True sustainability includes supporting people, not just the planet. At Wente Family Vineyards, we offer employees paid volunteer time to support causes they care about and provide resources that promote well-being. Beyond the vineyard, we contribute to more than 50 community-based nonprofits and support hundreds nationwide organizations. Our team lives out our values daily, giving back and fostering a culture of purpose and care.

###  A Commitment to the Future of Wine

Wente Family Vineyards takes a holistic approach to sustainability at every step- from grape to glass. We believe great wine starts with respect for the earth and continues with care for the people who make it possible. As we look to the future, we remain dedicated to creating wines that not only taste good but do good—for our community, our customers, and our planet.

Join us this Earth Day and beyond in raising a glass to a more sustainable tomorrow.
