# 2022 Livermore Valley Wetmore Cabernet Sauvignon

The 2022 Livermore Valley Wetmore Cabernet Sauvignon opens with aromas of black currant and cassis, complemented by a hint of "Livermore Dust." Creamy oak notes bring roasted cocoa nibs and hardwood complexity. On the palate, the wine offers layers of ripe black cherry and plum, leading to a long, satisfying finish. While initially supple, it transitions into a deep, rich profile with a firm tannin structure that will support its aging potential. *Cannot be shipped to Louisiana. 

Complimentary Ground Shipping on 6+ Bottles.
