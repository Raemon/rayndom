[ 2022 Livermore Valley Wetmore Cabernet Sauvignon ](/product/2022-wetmore-cabernet-sauvignon)

The 2022 Livermore Valley Wetmore Cabernet Sauvignon opens with aromas of black currant and cassis, complemented by a hint of "Livermore Dust." Creamy oak notes bring roasted cocoa nibs and hardwood complexity. On the palate, the wine offers layers of ripe black cherry and plum, leading to a long, satisfying finish. While initially supple, it transitions into a deep, rich profile with a firm tannin structure that will support its aging potential. *Cannot be shipped to Louisiana.

The 2024 Riva Ranch Riesling bursts with lively fruit character and delicate floral aromatics. Fragrant notes of honeysuckle and orange blossom lead the bouquet, layered with juicy white peach, apricot, and a touch of honeyed richness. On the palate, crisp pear and apple introduce a subtle sweetness at the core, balanced beautifully by a refreshing lift of acidity. This harmonious interplay results in a vibrant, fruit-forward wine with energy and finesse throughout.

[ 2024 Riva Ranch Chardonnay ](/product/wv-riva-ranch-chardonnay-2024)

This lush Chardonnay has plenty of character and is loaded with perfectly ripened apples, caramelized pineapple, and toasted brioche, which team together to form the foundation of this deep and delightfully expressive vineyard selection. The optimally ripened fruit is complemented by a tasteful measure of slightly creamy oak that hints at notes of crème Brule, along with a dollop of buttery richness that lasts well into the lengthy finish. The mouthfeel is slightly viscous and supple on entry, but manages to maintain youthful energy thanks to some carefully integrated supporting acidity that assures that the wine is as carefully balanced as it is wonderfully rich.
