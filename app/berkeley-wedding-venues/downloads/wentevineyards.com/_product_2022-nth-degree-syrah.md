# 2022 nth DEGREE Syrah

The 2022 nth DEGREE Syrah from Wente Vineyards leads with a mix of ripe plum and smoked meat aromas that are framed by clove and roasted coffee. Flavors are reminiscent of black raspberry, white pepper, and toasted vanilla. While rich and full ABV: bodied, this wine also showcases a velvety roundness and lingering plush tannins.
