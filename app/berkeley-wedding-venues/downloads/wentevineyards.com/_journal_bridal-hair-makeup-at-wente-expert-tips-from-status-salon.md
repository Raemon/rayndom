##  Bridal Beauty at Wente

###  Spotlight on Status Salon, Our Preferred Hair & Makeup Partner

At Wente Family Vineyards, we believe every wedding should feel effortlessly elegant—from the first welcome toast to the final dance of the night. To help our couples look and feel their best, we proudly partner with [Status Salon](https://statusalon.com/), one of the Tri-Valley’s premier beauty teams specializing in luxury bridal hair and makeup.

Owned by the talented JD Davidson, [Status Salon](https://statusalon.com/) has cultivated a reputation for elevated artistry, a calming presence, and flawless execution. We sat down with JD for a Q&A to talk trends, tips, and how brides can prepare for picture-perfect beauty on their Wente wedding day.

##### ✨ **What tips do you have for the entire bridal party on the wedding morning?**

**1\. Arrive on time.**  
“We create our schedule so each person gets the full time they need in our chair. Being on time helps the whole morning run smoothly.”

**2\. Start with clean hair.**  
“Squeaky-clean hair always curls best—and lasts the longest.”

**3\. Steam dresses before hair and makeup.**  
“While we often end up steaming dresses day-of, steam can cause curls to fall and even loosen fake lashes. It’s best if dresses are steamed ahead of time.”

**4\. Bring inspiration photos.**  
“Images help us understand your comfort zone and preferred style. Just be mindful—many Pinterest images are AI-generated, so realistic expectations are key!”

### Bridal Beauty Trends: What Artists Are Loving This Season

  * **Textured French Twist**  
A modern twist on a timeless style—effortlessly chic and romantic.
  * **Clean & Elegant Makeup**  
Soft glam, natural glow, and polished neutrals are in high demand.
  * **Bronzed & Sculpted Looks**  
Warm, sun-kissed tones that beautifully enhance photos in vineyard light.
  * **Sleek Bridal Bun**  
Minimalist, sophisticated, and perfect for windy vineyard afternoons.

##### ✨ **Common Wedding Makeup Mistakes to Avoid**

**1\. Skipping the trial.**  
“Always book a makeup _and_ hair trial. It gives you a vision of your final look and allows your artist to understand your skin, your style, and your comfort level. Meeting the artist beforehand also builds trust.”

**2\. Neglecting skin prep.**  
“Long-lasting, flawless makeup begins with hydrated, well-prepped skin. Starting a skincare routine early makes a huge difference.”

##### ✨ **How Can Brides Coordinate Makeup With Their Wedding Color Palette?**

“The best part about makeup is how customizable it is. Whether you’re leaning into soft elegance, a warm and romantic palette, or a bold Old Hollywood vibe, we can tailor your look to harmonize beautifully with your color scheme.”
