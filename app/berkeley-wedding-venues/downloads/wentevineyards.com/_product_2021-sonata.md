# 2021 Sonata

The 2021 Sonata Red Wine is an Australian inspired blend of Cabernet and Syrah that impresses with its exotic substance and engaging complexity. Abundant aromas of blackberry and plum fruit form the essence of this elegantly styled wine. Complimentary oak spices of fresh vanilla bean with a hint of glazed caramel do an excellent job of framing the core of dark fruit flavors in the mid-palate. Bright acidity and youthful tannins will help this wine to shine at your dinner table tonight but will also promise good things for those that can hold a bottle for five or six years. 

Complimentary Ground Shipping on 6+ Bottles.
