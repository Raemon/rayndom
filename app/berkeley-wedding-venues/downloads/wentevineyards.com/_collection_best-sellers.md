[ 2024 Riva Ranch Chardonnay ](/product/wv-riva-ranch-chardonnay-2024)

This lush Chardonnay has plenty of character and is loaded with perfectly ripened apples, caramelized pineapple, and toasted brioche, which team together to form the foundation of this deep and delightfully expressive vineyard selection. The optimally ripened fruit is complemented by a tasteful measure of slightly creamy oak that hints at notes of crème Brule, along with a dollop of buttery richness that lasts well into the lengthy finish. The mouthfeel is slightly viscous and supple on entry, but manages to maintain youthful energy thanks to some carefully integrated supporting acidity that assures that the wine is as carefully balanced as it is wonderfully rich.
