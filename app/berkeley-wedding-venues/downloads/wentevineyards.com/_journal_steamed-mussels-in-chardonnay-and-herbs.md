## Instructions

1

Prep the mussels: Rinse and scrub mussels under cold water, discarding any that are open and don’t close when tapped.

2

Sauté the aromatics: In a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add shallots, garlic, and red pepper flakes, and sauté for 2–3 minutes until fragrant and translucent.

3

Add the wine: Pour in Morning Fog Chardonnay, scraping up any bits on the bottom of the pan. Bring to a gentle simmer.

4

Steam the mussels: Add mussels to the pan and cover. Cook for 5–7 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until all the mussels open.

5

Finish the dish: Remove from heat. Discard any unopened mussels. Stir in butter, lemon zest, juice, and chopped parsley. Season with salt and pepper.

6

Serve with crusty bread for dipping—and a chilled glass of Morning Fog Chardonnay.

###  A Chardonnay That Changed the Game

Wente Family Vineyards has a storied history rooted in innovation and excellence. In 1912, second-generation winemaker Ernest Wente imported Chardonnay cuttings from France and planted them in California, giving birth to what is now famously known as the Wente Clone—the most widely planted Chardonnay clone in the U.S. Today, over 75% of all California Chardonnay can trace its lineage back to the Wente Clone.

Our Morning Fog Chardonnay is a nod to the cooling marine influence of the Pacific Ocean, where coastal fog drifts through the vineyards, preserving crisp acidity and vibrant aromatics. It’s an ideal wine to cook with—and sip alongside—fresh seafood dishes like these delicious and quick mussels.

###  Why It Works

The bright acidity and citrus notes of Morning Fog Chardonnay cut through the richness of the mussels and butter, while its hints of green apple and vanilla bring depth and harmony to the dish. Cooking with the same wine you’re sipping ensures every bite and sip sing in perfect unison.
