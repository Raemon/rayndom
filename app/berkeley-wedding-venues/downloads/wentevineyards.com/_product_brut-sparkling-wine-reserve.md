# Brut Reserve Sparkling Wine

Founded in 1883, the Wente family has a long history of crafting estate-grown wines that express the character of the Livermore Valley. Our Legacy Series Brut Reserve continues this tradition, produced from select vineyard blocks chosen for their exceptional fruit quality in a standout harvest. Extended aging on the lees contributes depth, refinement, and a beautifully integrated mousse. The result is a sparkling wine of precision, freshness, and layered complexity that reflects the Wente family's enduring commitment to crafting wines of elegance and distinction.

##  Tasting Notes 

The 2019 Brut Reserve was crafted from a standout harvest, selected for its exceptional fruit quality. Extended aging on the lees enhances its fine mousse and builds layers of brioche, citrus, and green apple. The result is a refined sparkling wine with vibrant acidity and a long, elegant finish.
