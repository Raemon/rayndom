#  Our Vineyards 

Wente Vineyards proudly owns and operates in two world-class wine regions in California, Livermore Valley in the San Francisco Bay AVA and Arroyo Seco in the Monterey County AVA. With 3,000 acres of estate-grown vineyards and over 20 varieties grown.

##  Livermore Valley San Francisco Bay AVA

Located 20 miles east of the San Francisco Bay, the Livermore Valley brings moderating climates from foggy mornings, warm midday temperatures, and cool evenings.

Cool and foggy mornings give way to warm midday temperatures during the growing season. Then, early afternoon breezes and evening fog lower temperatures again, preserving the fruit’s natural acidity. This climactic cycle is beneficial to wine grapes, which need warmth for healthy growth, maturation, and development, and cool nights and mornings to retain delicate flavors.

Wente Vineyards estate vineyards are located on sloping hillsides, on stony riverbeds, and reside at the base of sandstone cliffs. The morning fog makes it an excellent growing region for Chardonnay. Simultaneously, the warmer temperatures on the hillside allow varieties such as Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon to develop to full maturity.

Three distinct soil types also differentiate the Wente family’s Livermore Valley vineyards: deep-sandy loam, lean soil with large amounts of gravel and rock, and soil composed of red clay, rock, and gravel.

##  Arroyo Seco Monterey AVA

Karl L. Wente, the grandson of the winery’s founder, pioneered winegrowing in Monterey County’s Arroyo Seco district when he planted vineyards in the region in 1961. He was impressed by the Arroyo Seco river region’s climate, the abundance of excellent water, and the well-drained, rocky soils. The foresight of his decision is evidenced by the critically acclaimed wines from the area.

Arroyo Seco is a cooler region with an extended growing season, making it more favorable for cool-climate varieties. In addition, soils replete with shale and limestone deposits provide excellent drainage and minerals that impart significant vines’ significant flavor components. These factors also result in smaller, more intense berries and concentrated flavors. Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot, and Riesling are among the varieties planted.

## Family Owned 

“I view it as a critical responsibility of my family to continue enhancing the development and branding of the appellations of the Livermore Valley, San Francisco Bay, and Arroyo Seco, Monterey, ultimately positioning them among the most remembered and renowned appellations in California.”

Phil Wente, 4th Generation Winegrower
