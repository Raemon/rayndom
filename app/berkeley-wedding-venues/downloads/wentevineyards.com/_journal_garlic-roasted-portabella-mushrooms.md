# Garlic Roasted Portabella Mushrooms with Balsamic and Arugula

Prep Time - 10 minutes | Time To Make - 30 minutes 

Meaty portabella mushrooms make the perfect side for a summer barbecue but pack enough flavor to shine on their own. A simple salad that can stand up to a delicious Pinot Noir is an easy dish that will always impress. 

## Ingredients

4 portabella mushrooms 

3 cloves of garlic 

4 Tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil

1 tablespoon Balsamic Vinegar Salt 

2 cups loosely packed baby arugula

## Instructions

1

Preheat the oven to 375°F. Finely grate or mince the garlic cloves and mix with 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a small mixing bowl.

2

Remove the stems from the mushrooms and place them in a baking dish, then spoon the garlic oil evenly over the mushrooms and season with a pinch of salt. 

3

Roast for 15-18 minutes, or until mushrooms are caramelized and softened. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. 

4

Thinly slice the mushrooms and arrange evenly in one layer on a plate. Drizzle the sliced mushrooms with the remaining tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and the balsamic vinegar. 

5

Finish with a scattering of fresh baby arugula.
