## Our Programs

## WE Give

### Wente’s Charitable Giving Program

  * WE Give will complement the goals and mission of the Wente Foundation for Arts Education.
  * Allows for employees to donate to select charities through a simple payroll deduction.
  * Giving through this program will be 100% optional to employees and will include information on potential tax benefits for charitable giving.
  * In 2022, we are adding a company match. Wente Family Estates will match all contributions to the WE Give program in 2022 at the rate of 50%. So for every dollar donated, the company will add an- other 50 cents.



## Artist Series Wines

### Giving Back Each Bottle

The Wente Foundation for Arts Education (WFAE) is pleased to share that as of December 2021, it has crossed a milestone threshold and donated **over $1,150,000 to arts education programs since its inception in 2012.** WFAE’s mission is to raise money for art education programs in the Livermore Valley and Bay Area because we believe that the arts are an essential part of a well-rounded education. The social impact of the Wente Foundation for Arts Education is an important aspect of Wente Family Estates’ overall commitment to sustainability and the community they serve.
