# Golden Chicken with Roasted Tomatoes

A perfect pairing for Wente Family Vineyards Riva Ranch Chardonnay This roasted chicken with tomatoes recipe highlights fresh, California-inspired flavors. Juicy chicken, slow-roasted cherry tomatoes, and fragrant herbs come together in one pan for a dish that feels both comforting and elegant. It pairs beautifully with Wente Family Vineyards Riva Ranch Chardonnay. As the tomatoes roast, they become sweet and jammy, creating a light pan sauce that complements the savory chicken. Finished with fresh herbs and olive oil, this dish reflects the relaxed, food-forward style of wine country cooking.

2 cups cherry or grape tomatoes 

4 cloves garlic, lightly smashed 

2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for finishing

## Instructions

1

Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). 

2

Sear the chicken Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove and set aside. 

3

Roast the tomatoes In the same skillet, add tomatoes, garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes until the tomatoes begin to soften. Deglaze with white wine or chicken stock, scraping up any browned bits from the pan. Bake Return the chicken to the skillet, nestling it among the tomatoes. Transfer to the oven and roast for 20 to 25 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the tomatoes are blistered and concentrated. 

4

Finish and serve Drizzle lightly with olive oil, garnish with fresh herbs, and serve warm.
