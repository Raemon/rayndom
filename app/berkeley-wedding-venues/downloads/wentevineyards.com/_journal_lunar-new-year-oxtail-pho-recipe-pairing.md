# Lunar New Year Oxtail Pho Recipe Pairing

We are excited to collaborate with Tina Le, also known as @AllTinaaThings, to showcase our Southern Hill Cabernet Sauvignon with her recommended Lunar New Year recipe wine pairing. “Like many, one of our Lunar New Year traditions is getting together and enjoying flavorful home-cooked meals, so I am preparing a delicious Wine-Braised Oxtail with Rice Noodles this year. This unique Vietnamese French recipe I ate growing up is both modern and traditional, which pays homage to my ethnicity. The dish is simple, yet extremely important to pair with a wine that is just as rich as the meat cut – Wente Vineyards’ Southern Hills Cabernet Sauvignon is just the right one! Follow my easy 3-step recipe below for a hearty Wine-Braised Oxtail with Rice Noodles paired with Wente Vineyards’ Southern Hills Cabernet Sauvignon for your Lunar New Year celebration!” – Tina
