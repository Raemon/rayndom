# Roasted Butternut Squash Pasta with Brown Butter Sage

As the golden hues of harvest fade into crisp autumn evenings, comfort takes on a new meaning at the table. This Roasted Butternut Squash Pasta with Brown Butter Sage is a seasonal favorite — rich, and beautifully balanced. Sweet roasted squash and caramelized garlic come together with nutty brown butter and fresh sage, creating a dish that feels both rustic and refined. Paired with a glass of Wente Family Vineyards Cabernet Franc, this cozy pasta becomes something extraordinary. The wine’s notes of red plum, dried herbs, and subtle spice complement the roasted depth of the butternut squash, while its refined tannins and smooth finish bring harmony to each bite. It’s the kind of pairing that invites you to slow down, savor, and celebrate the season.

## Instructions

1

Preheat the oven to 400°F. Spread cubed butternut squash on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. – Slice the tops off two garlic heads, drizzle with olive oil, wrap tightly in foil, and place on the same sheet. Roast for 30–35 minutes, until the squash is tender and caramelized and the garlic is soft. 

2

Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves out of their skins into a blender. Add the roasted butternut squash, coconut milk, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth and creamy, adding a splash of water or broth if needed to thin. 

3

Boil pasta in salted water until al dente, reserving about 1 cup of the pasta water. 

4

Add the butternut squash sauce to a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in grated Parmesan and a little of the reserved pasta water until silky and smooth. Toss in the cooked pasta and coat well, adding more pasta water as needed for creaminess. 

5

In a small skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add sage leaves and cook until the butter turns golden brown and fragrant, about 3–4 minutes. Remove from heat immediately. 

6

Serve the pasta with a drizzle of brown butter sage and an extra sprinkle of Parmesan and black pepper.

#### **Why It Pairs Perfectly with Cabernet Franc**

The Wente Family Vineyards Cabernet Franc is a masterclass in balance and restraint, offering notes of **ripe red fruit, dried herbs, cedar, and soft tannins**. Its earthy backbone enhances the roasted character of the squash and brown butter, while its smooth, medium-bodied palate keeps each bite feeling elegant and warm.

For a perfect night in, serve the pasta alongside roasted Brussels sprouts or a simple green salad — and let the wine shine as the centerpiece of your table.
