# Steamed Catfish Filet by Chef Kathy Fang

Prep Time - 5 minutes | Time To Make - 45 minutes 

We are thrilled to have Food Network star and restauranteur Chef Kathy Fang at our Women Behind Wente dinner on March 3rd, 2023. Kathy was kind enough to share one of her recipes that you can make at home if you can’t make our event. This Steamed Catfish Filet can be swapped with other fish like seabass, striped bass, salmon and scallops. Or make it vegetarian with a medium-soft tofu, which would be delicious with the black bean sauce. About Kathy Fang: Born and raised in San Francisco, Kathy Fang grew up in the kitchen of her family’s popular restaurant, House of Nanking, before opening Fang Restaurant with her father in 2009 as co-owner and chef. Today, Kathy balances her responsibilities as a restauranteur with pursuing her dream of teaching others to create easy, healthy, and delicious dishes at home while also making regular appearances on cooking and food competition shows. She is the author of “Easy Asian Cookbook.” As of late, you can find Chef Fang on the Food Network show Chef Dynasty: House of Fang. She is a two-time Chopped champion and has also appeared on Alex vs. America, Beat Bobby Flay and Guy’s Grocery Games. She’s a returning guest on NBC’s TODAY Show and has been a guest judge on Alex vs America in 2022.

## Instructions

1

Get the rice cooking in a rice cooker before you start the catfish, broccoli, and black bean sauce.

2

In a shallow, stainless-steel bowl or plate that fits inside your steamer, season catfish filet with fish sauce and mirin for 5 minutes.

3

Top catfish with ginger and scallion

4

Bring steamer to a rolling boil and place fish in bowl on top of steamer and close lid. Steam for 6-8 minutes or until cooked through

5

While the catfish is steaming, bring a pot of water to boil. Season with sesame oil, salt, and sugar

6

Cut Chinese broccoli in half, separating the stems from the leaves. If stems are thick, slice them in half vertically. Cook stems first for 2 minutes, then add leaves and cook for 30 seconds. Remove from water and set aside. 

7

To make the sauce, heat a saucepan to high heat with oil. Add garlic, ginger, and black beans, and sauté for 30 seconds to release flavors.

8

Add the rest of the ingredients to the pan, including the diced peppers, and simmer on medium heat for 1 minute.

9

Stir in slurry, a little at a time, to thicken as desired.

10

Spoon rice on a plate. Top with catfish fi let, drizzle fish with sauce, and top with Chinese broccoli.

11

Drizzle with chili oil, if you want to add a little more heat
