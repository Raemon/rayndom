# 2024 Louis Mel Sauvignon Blanc

Our 2024 Louis Mel Sauvignon Blanc displays classic fruit combined with juicy acidity which adds up to a wine bursting with youthful exuberance. This vintage showcases notes of classic grapefruit with additional notes of white apricot, guava, and key lime. These notes are complemented by fruit-driven flavors of sweet Meyer lemon and candied citrus. This wine is well rounded with a balanced acidity, complimented by a touch of minerality on the finish.
