### Why Videography Is Worth the Investment

Many couples see videography as a “nice-to-have,” but after the wedding, countless brides say their film was one of their most cherished investments. Being able to hear your vows again, watch your first dance, or see loved ones laughing together is a priceless gift that only grows in value with time.

As Jody Amos shares:  
_“Couples often find that a beautifully crafted film becomes more valuable with every passing year — especially when loved ones who were there can no longer be. A great wedding video isn’t just for today — it’s a legacy.”_
