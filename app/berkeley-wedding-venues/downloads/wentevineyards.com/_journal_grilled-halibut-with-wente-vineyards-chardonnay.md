## Instructions

1

Make the pistachio pesto: In a food processor, combine the basil, parsley, pistachios, garlic, and salt. Pulse to blend. With the motor running, add the oil in a thin, steady stream, blending until smooth. Stop and scrape down the sides of the work bowl once or twice. Transfer the pesto to a bowl and stir in pepper to taste. 

2

Heat the chicken stock in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the sliced leek and simmer until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the florets to the saucepan, season with salt, cover, and adjust the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook until the cauliflower is tender, about 10 minutes. Drain in a sieve, reserving the liquid. Puree the leeks and cauliflower in a food processor until very smooth, thinning as needed with the reserved cooking liquid. Return the puree to the pot, season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Cover and keep warm over low heat.

3

Preheat the oven to 400°F. Prepare a medium charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium. Preheat the grill rack to prevent the fish from sticking. 

4

Slice the zucchini lengthwise about 3/8-inch thick. In a bowl, toss the zucchini slices with the olive oil, vinegar, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Arrange them on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake until tender and golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Keep warm in a low oven. 

5

Coat the halibut with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the halibut, skin side down, on the preheated grill rack. Cook about 5 minutes, then turn and cook on the flesh side until the fish barely flakes, about 3 minutes longer. It will continue to cook as it cools. 

6

To serve, spoon some of the cauliflower-leek puree on each plate. Put zucchini slices alongside. Top with the fish and spoon pesto overall. Serve immediately.
