# 2022 Cabernet Franc

Our small lot wine is harvested from carefully selected blocks that are estate-grown and sustainably farmed. With an east-west valley orientation, the site gets warm days and cool nights that are influenced by fog and breezes from the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean. The grapes are handpicked and sorted at harvest time in order to ensure premium quality.

##  Tasting Notes 

The 2022 Small Lot Cabernet Franc from Wente Vineyards is complex with layered aromas of cherry cola, black pepper, cocoa and, baked cinnamon. The palate opens with red cherry followed by warm vanilla oak on the finish. This medium bodied wine is polished and refined to such a degree that it is eminently attractive right now but should age and evolve beautifully for the next seven years.

## FOOD PAIRINGS TO TRY

##### With 2022 Cabernet Franc

This wine pairs great with a marinated tri-tip or beef stew. Or for a vegetarian option, try mushroom risotto to complement its earthy notes. Additionally, a charcuterie board featuring aged cheeses and cured meats makes for an excellent accompaniment, bringing out the wine's fruity complexity
