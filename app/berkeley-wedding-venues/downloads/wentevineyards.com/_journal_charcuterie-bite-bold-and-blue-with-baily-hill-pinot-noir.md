# Charcuterie Bite: Bold and Blue with Baily Hill Pinot Noir

Elevate your wine and charcuterie experience with this indulgent Bold and Blue pairing—crafted to complement the vibrant, fruity character of Baily Hill Pinot Noir. Pigs and Pinot are a timeless match, and this combination of Columbus Calabrese Salame, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, and Ghirardelli Dark Chocolate Caramel proves why. The rich, creamy, and slightly peppery flavors of the blue cheese come alive against the salame’s rustic spice, while the dark chocolate adds a touch of elegance and warmth. Finished with candied pecans and fresh cherries, it’s a perfect bite for wine lovers seeking a bold yet balanced Pinot Noir pairing.
