# Beluga Lentils, Wilted Radicchio, & King Trumpets Recipe Pairing with nth DEGREE Merlot 

Prep Time - 30 minutes | Time To Make - 45 minutes 

Recipe by Leigh Orleans, Hells Kitchen contestant Season 22. Follow her at @_chefleigh “This dish is one of my ultimate comfort foods. It delivers richness and depth without relying on a heavy cut of red meat, which is often the go-to pairing for red wine. Instead, it offers layers of flavor that are both satisfying and complex, making it a perfect match for a versatile variety like Merlot. I love Merlot for its deliciously smooth texture, and it pairs beautifully with this dish. The nth DEGREE Merlot would complement the flavors perfectly, elevating the experience with its balance of richness and elegance.” – Leigh Orleans

## Instructions

1

Beluga Lentils: Sautee 1 diced medium shallot with 6 sliced garlic cloves in 2 tbsp olive oil until softened. Add 2 tbsp minced parsley stems. Pour in 3 cups warmed water with 2 tbsp diluted miso paste and bring to a boil. Add 1 cup rinsed beluga lentils. Cook until they are toothsome but not mushy, then add salt to taste. Optional but delicious: stir in 1/4 cup microplaned parmesan cheese and a tablespoon of good olive oil.

2

Radicchio: Cut in half, sprinkle with salt, then sear until browned in olive oil. Pour over 1/4 cup sherry wine, 2 tbsp soy sauce, and 2 tbsp water. Cover with a lid and cook on low until softened. In the remaining pan liquid, melt a heaping tablespoon of butter and glaze the radicchio with a spoon.

3

Trumpet Mushrooms: Cut king trumpet mushrooms in half and score with a pairing knife. Sear in a few tablespoons of oil, flip, and baste with fresh thyme and butter. Finish with flake salt.

4

Breadcrumbs: Small dice a crusty bread (sourdough baguette is my preference… about 1/4 cup but you cant have too many breadcrumbs) and sautee in a few tbsp of olive oil until crispy but with the slightest bit of chew left. Grate in a garlic clove and cook until fragrant.

5

Garnish with parsley and enjoy!!!
