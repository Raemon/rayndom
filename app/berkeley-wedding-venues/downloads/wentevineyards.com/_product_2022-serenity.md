# 2022 Serenity

The 2022 Artist Series Serenity is an expressive and enjoyable wine, distinguished by its lively and well-integrated fruit and spice notes. Its Rhone- inspired palate is marked by a harmonious blend of ripe plum and pepper, underscored by a subtle black tea nuance. The bright tannins, contributed by Petite Sirah, add structure and elegance, enhancing the wine's complexity. This sophisticated profile ensures a refined and memorable drinking experience.
