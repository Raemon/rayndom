# Meet Harinder Klair

#  Meet Harinder Klair 

###  Enologist

Continuing our Women Behind Wente 2022 series, we are delighted to introduce Harinder Klair! Harinder has been on our team for just over two years as an Enologist. She plays a key role on our winemaking team – analyzing wines from grape to glass to ensure the best wine is being bottled. Learn more about her role and personal life in her Q+A below.

**Q: Briefly describe your role at Wente Vineyards?**

A: Enology is the scientific study of wines and winemaking. I interpret wine analysis and taste daily for potential wine problems and provide suggestions to the winemaking team. The best part of this position is that you get to see and taste from grape to wine in the bottle.

**Q: What significant moments led you to this position?**

A: I have a B.S. in Biochemistry and stumbled into the wine industry not knowing anything about wine. Wine chemistry and all the challenges that come with it made me stay and I am proud to still be in the wine industry after 12 years. I know a lot about winemaking chemistry but wanted to explore on the winemaking side, which led me to this position.

**Q: What is your favorite part of your job?**

All aspects of the harvest season, but especially seeing the grapes getting dumped into the hopper never gets old for me.

**Q: What energizes you about work?**

A: Challenges that come with the position and also working on something different everyday.

**Q: What is your goal for the next few years?**

A: My goal is to become a winemaker.

**Q: How have you built confidence and/or resiliency throughout your career?**

A: Just believing in myself. I have learned from my mistakes and realized that there is nothing wrong with speaking up or bring ideas to the table and standing up for myself when needed.

**Q: How have you balanced being a mother and a professional?**

I get a lot of support from my parents and my husband. My husband has always been my support system in my career and we have learned to work around our schedules. Also, I am lucky to have a flexible schedule. I have a four day work week which gives me one day to take part in my son’s daily routine and we both look forward to it.

**Q: How do you unplug from work?**

A: Sometimes you just have to put you work phone away and spend time on what you like most. I love to go on long runs or just sit down with a good book.

**Q: What is a fun fact about yourself?**

A: I am a half marathon runner so I love to train for them year-round, which also helps with clearing my mind. I also love to crochet and make items for my nieces and nephews.

**Q: What is your favorite Wente Vineyards wine?**

A: [Winemakers Studio Lot 012](https://wentestage.wpenginepowered.com/product/2018-lot-012-red-blend) and [nth DEGREE Cabernet Sauvignon](https://wentestage.wpenginepowered.com/product/2017-nth-degree-cabernet-sauvignon)
