##  Tasting Notes 

The 2024 Riverbank Riesling is a radiant expression of fruit and fragrance, wrapped in elegance and charm. Delicate aromas of honeysuckle and orange blossom drift gently from the glass, entwined with the lush allure of ripe peach, white apricot, and a whisper of golden honey. On the palate, tender notes of freshly sliced pear and crisp apple bring a soft, caressing sweetness, gracefully lifted by a touch of bright acidity. The result is a beautifully poised wine, vibrant and graceful, with a lingering sense of freshness and vitality.
