# Uncork a Bottle, Unleash a Bocce Ball

Aug 4, 2025

![Beringer Vineyards Bocce Ball](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/1000X650_BER_BOCCE_BALL.png?v=1756243106&width=320)

Imagine a leisurely stroll through Beringer Vineyards, where you're not only surrounded by the expansive views of our vineyards and the charm of our historic buildings, but also an enticing opportunity awaits - a game of Bocce Ball. Our court, nestled amid the verdant landscapes, offers the perfect place to relax, enjoy, and indulge in the timeless charm of this ancient game. If you're new to Bocce or need a refresher, we have crafted this comprehensive guide just for you.

## What is Bocce Ball?

Bocce Ball, a game of antiquity, traces its lineage back to the Roman Empire, enthralling players with its simple rules and strategic maneuvers. It is a game of skill, precision, and camaraderie, seamlessly blending competition and leisure.

## The Essentials of Bocce Ball

The game's equipment comprises a set of eight larger balls, evenly divided by color into two teams, and a smaller ball known as the "pallino" or "jack". The crux of the game lies in propelling your team's balls closer to the pallino than your opponents' balls.

## The Bocce Ball Court at Beringer Vineyards

Our bocce ball court is a rectangular stretch, measuring about 13x91 feet, with a leveled surface. Bocce Ball's appeal lies in its versatility; the game isn't bound by the confines of a dedicated court and can be played on any flat, outdoor space.

## Playing Bocce Ball at Beringer Vineyards: A Step-by-Step Guide

### Form your Teams

Divide your group into two teams, consisting of one to four players each. If there are more than two players on a team, the four balls are equally distributed among the players.

### Launch the Pallino

To set the game in motion, a player from the first team throws the pallino into the court. The pallino must cross the center line and be at least a foot distant from the side and end lines.

### Kick-off the Rolling

The player who threw the pallino now rolls the first bocce ball, aiming to get it as close to the pallino as possible.

### Turn-based Play

Players from the opposing team now step in, trying to either roll their ball closer to the pallino or knock away the opponent’s ball. Play alternates between teams, but if a team gets their ball closest to the pallino, they pass their turn, allowing the other team to roll until they surpass (i.e., get a ball closer to the pallino) the best ball.

### Tallying the Points

After all balls have been rolled, the round or "frame" concludes, and scoring commences. Only one team can score in a frame. Points are awarded for each ball that is closer to the pallino than the closest ball of the opposition. If a team's ball is touching the pallino (a "baci" or "kiss"), it fetches them two points.

### Sustaining the Play

The team that scored in the previous frame initiates the next round by throwing the pallino. The game rolls on until a team accumulates the pre-determined total, typically 12 or 15 points.

### Strategies to Amplify Your Bocce Game

  1. Master the Art of Placement: A well-placed ball can block the opponent from reaching the pallino, while also getting your team closer to the target.
  2. Learn the Knock-off Technique: If the opponent's balls are crowding the pallino, don't shy away from using a stronger throw to knock them away.
  3. Sacrifice to Gain: Occasionally, it might be worth sacrificing a point if it means pushing the opponent's balls away and gaining control of the pallino for the next frame.
