# A Thanksgiving Table to Remember

Nov 7, 2025

![A Thanksgiving Table to Remember](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/BER_Thanksgiving_Pairing.png?v=1763141396&width=320)

### _A Food and Wine Pairing Guide from Beringer_

From the first course to the final toast, every dish on the Thanksgiving table deserves a perfect pour. Whether you’re planning an elegant dinner or a cozy gathering, these thoughtful pairings bring balance, warmth, and a touch of celebration to every bite.

* * *

#### **Start with Seasonal**

##### _[Private Reserve Chardonnay](https://www.beringer.com/products/2023-private-reserve-chardonnay) paired with Silky Meyer Lemon Soup_

Bright and luxurious, our Private Reserve Chardonnay is the ideal way to open the meal. Its layered notes of citrus and vanilla bean echo the vibrant flavors of a silky Meyer lemon soup, while its rich texture complements the soup’s velvety finish. A fresh, elegant start to your holiday feast.

#### **A Taste of Tradition**

##### _[Winery Exclusive Pinot Noir](https://www.beringer.com/products/2022-winery-exclusive-pinot-noir) paired with Chicken Liver Pâté on Crostini_

This classic appetizer meets its match in the supple, fruit-forward profile of our Winery Exclusive Pinot Noir. The wine’s red cherry and subtle spice lift the richness of the pâté and bring harmony to every bite. A nod to timeless flavors, elevated by a glass that’s equally refined.

#### **A Show-Stopping Main**

##### _[Bancroft Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon](https://www.beringer.com/products/ber-bancroft-ranch-hm-cabs-22) paired with Stuffed Duck with Cherry Port Sauce_

The depth and structure of our Bancroft Ranch Cabernet make it a natural partner for the bold, savory flavors of roasted duck. Notes of dark plum, cassis, and toasted oak mirror the cherry port sauce, creating a pairing that feels both indulgent and perfectly balanced.

* * *

#### **Save Room for Dessert**

##### _[2020 Celebration Cuvée Magnum](https://www.beringer.com/products/2020-celebration-cuvee-magnum) paired with Black Cherry Cobbler_

Finish your feast with something festive. The 2020 Celebration Cuvée brings lively bubbles and bright red fruit, a perfect complement to the sweetness of a warm Black Cherry Cobbler.

“Our Celebration Cuvée is the perfect choice for Thanksgiving. Blended to be enjoyed by all, and offered in a magnum, it ensures there’s plenty to share with the whole family. A Black Cherry Cobbler provides a sweet, fruit-forward finale that pairs beautifully with the wine.” — _Margo Van Staaveren, Director of Winemaking_

* * *

From the first sip to the last bite, these pairings create a Thanksgiving table to remember—one filled with flavor, connection, and the spirit of sharing that defines the season.
