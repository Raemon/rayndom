# Holiday Cheese & Wine Board 101

Dec 2, 2025

![Holiday Cheese & Wine Board 101](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/Wine_CheeseBoard_header_e0372a12-5616-483f-8439-d6419b76e476.jpg?v=1764702425&width=320)

Holiday hosting does not need to be complicated. With three great cheeses, a few tasty accents, and a couple of Beringer wines, you can build a board that looks beautiful and feels generous.

## 1) Pick your trio of cheeses

Choose one from each style for balance.

  * **Creamy:** Triple-cream Brie

  * **Tangy:** Fresh goat cheese (chèvre)

  * **Aged:** 18–24 month Gouda or sharp white cheddar




Plan about 2 ounces of cheese per person.

## 2) Add accents and texture

Think sweet, salty, crunchy, and fresh.

  * **Fruits:** Fresh figs, apple or pear slices, dried apricots

  * **Crunch:** Marcona almonds, candied or salted pecans

  * **Condiments:** Local honey, fig jam, whole-grain mustard

  * **Snacks:** Quality crackers and sliced baguette

  * **Little treats:** Dark chocolate squares




## 3) Build the board

  * Place cheeses first at 12, 4, and 8 o’clock for balance.

  * Add small bowls for honey, jam, and nuts.

  * Fan crackers and bread in a few spots.

  * Tuck fruit and chocolate to add color.

  * Finish with fresh herbs like rosemary for a seasonal touch.




## 4) Style like a pro

  * Set cheeses out 30 minutes before serving.

  * Pre-slice a few pieces to invite that first bite.

  * Give each cheese its own knife.

  * Use odd numbers for garnishes for a natural look.

  * Leave a little negative space so the board does not feel crowded.




* * *

## Wines to pour with your board

A few Beringer favorites that play beautifully with this spread.

  * **2023 Private Reserve Napa Valley Chardonnay**  
Creamy texture and bright acidity make a great match with triple-cream Brie, honey, and Marcona almonds.

  * **2022 Knights Valley Cabernet Sauvignon**  
Dark fruit and structure pair well with aged Gouda or sharp cheddar. Try a square of dark chocolate on the side.

  * **2021 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon**  
A showstopper for richer bites and aged cheeses like Parmigiano Reggiano or 24-month Gouda. A special pour for the holiday table.




* * *

**Tip:** For a crowd, plan at least half a bottle of wine per guest and keep one extra chilled white on hand.
