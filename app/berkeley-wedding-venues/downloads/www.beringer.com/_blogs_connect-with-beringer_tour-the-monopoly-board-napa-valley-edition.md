# Tour the Monopoly Board, Napa Valley Edition

Aug 11, 2025

![Beringer Vineyars Napa Valley Monopoly Board](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/1000X650_Monopoly.png?v=1756137178&width=320)

The new Monopoly Napa Valley Edition board celebrates all the best of the valley. From its unique bed and breakfasts to its small towns and Michelin Star restaurant scene, there is so much to love and experience. Here at Beringer, we’re proud to be a part of the community for over a century and were ecstatic to hear we were featured on the board.

Roll the dice to get in on the fun of building your own Napa empire. Pass go for the chance to build hotels and houses while steering clear of those steep Napa property taxes. Will you hit the jackpot with the Community Chest or get on the wrong side of a Chance card and have to tough out a bad harvest? No matter what happens on the board, with a glass of Beringer wine in hand, there are only winners.

## Meet the Monopoly Properties

### Wineries and Tasting Rooms

Over 450 wineries dot the Napa Valley’s 30-mile span. From historic institutions like Beringer to new wineries experimenting with natural fermentation, there is truly something for every kind of wine lover. In addition to Beringer, the board features the following wineries: Frank Family Vineyards, Sterling Vineyard, Napa Cellars, Hall Wines, and Jam Cellars.

### Bed and Breakfast

Napa’s bed and breakfasts offer intimate, familial experiences in unmatched locations. Each one is unique. You can find everything from small guest cottages to luxuriously appointed suites to European-style Chateaus.

  * [**Senza Hotel**](https://senzahotel.com/ "Senza Hotel") \- Charming and elegant, the Senza Hotel is at the crossroads of the best of the Napa Valley. With a fire pit, pool, and complimentary breakfast, it has everything you need to rest and recharge.
  * [**Silverado Resort**](https://www.silveradoresort.com/ "Silverado Resort") \- Nestled on 300 picturesque acres, Silverado Resort offers two golf courses, three pools, nine tennis courts, a fabulous spa, and multiple world-class restaurants. The resort is also full of history—it’s 150 years old and was once a private estate.

### Transportation

**Hot Air Balloon Ride** \- If you get up early enough and take a drive down Highway 29, you’ll be treated to dozens of multicolor balloons floating serenely over the vines. If you want the full Napa Valley experience, a hot air balloon ride is a must.

[**Alta Luxury Transportation**](https://www.altats.com/ "Alta Luxury Transportation") \- Locally owned and operated, Alta Luxury Transportation is ready for all your driving needs. No need to worry about designated drivers or moving a large group with Alta as part of your trip.

**Fly with Wine** \- A Fly with Wine suitcase is a must if you are planning on taking your Napa Valley favorites home. Made specifically to carry and protect wine bottles, it removes the hassle of checking wine at the airport and is guaranteed to get your bottles home safely.

**Bike Trail** \- Winding through south Napa and Yountville, the bike trail is one of the best ways to experience the valley. Pet and family friendly, you’ll see locals getting their exercise in, pass iconic wineries and get up close to the stunning views that surround Highway 29.

  * **Saint Helena** \- Often referred to as Napa Valley’s main street, the charming town of Saint Helena lies in between Yountville in the south and Calistoga in the north. Beringer is a key part of the town’s history. Still, on our property, today is the Hudson House, the former home of David Hudson, one of Saint Helena’s first settlers.
  * **Calistoga** \- Located at the very north end of the Valley, Calistoga is surrounded by the Vaca Mountains and thousands of acres of vineyards. It’s a little more casual than the rest of the valley and known for its natural geothermal hot springs and—you guessed it—incredible tasting rooms.
  * **Yountville** \- Smack in the center of the valley, Yountville isn’t your typical small town. It boasts multiple Michelin star restaurants, a distinguished art scene, and gorgeous luxury hotels all within walking distance of each other. It’s also home to our chardonnay vineyard. The clay-loam soils in the area are renowned for producing the rich, full flavors and structure that make our chardonnays so delicious.
  * **American Canyon** \- At the very southern tip of the Napa Valley, American Canyon is an ideal jumping off point for all your Napa adventures. Its proximity to the Vallejo ferry terminal makes it easy to access from San Francisco. For those traveling with kids, it’s also close to attractions like the Jelly Belly Factory and Six Flags Discovery Kingdom.
  * [**The Model Bakery**](https://www.themodelbakery.com/ "The Model Bakery") \- No trip to Napa Valley is complete without a stop at the Model Bakery. It’s best known as the home of Oprah’s favorite English muffin and for its incredible assortment of bread and pastries. It’s also conveniently located just a few minutes down the road from Beringer, making it a perfect stop before or after your tasting.
  * [**La Cheve Bakery and Brews**](https://www.ilovelacheve.com/ "La Cheve Bakery and Brews") \- Located in Napa’s oldest building, La Cheve is a family-run Mexican restaurant that also brews its own beer. Its lively atmosphere, inventive menu, and locally famous birria make it a perfect place to stop between tastings.
  * [**Oxbow Public Market**](https://oxbowpublicmarket.com/ "Oxbow Public Market") \- Oysters, chocolate, locally brewed beer, Gott’s Roadside burgers—there is literally something for everyone at this unique community gathering space. Visit for lunch, dinner, or just a snack.
  * **Bounty Hunter** \- Located in the heart of downtown Napa, the Bounty Hunter is a true Napa institution with a selection of over 400 hard-to-find wines. The 18-page wine list is just a start, the restaurant also features a wide selection of whiskeys and fine spirits. Don’t just go for the libations, however, the Bounty Hunter serves up some of the best BBQ in the valley.
  * [**Napa Valley College**](https://www.napavalley.edu/ "Napa Valley College") \- The tree-lined campus of the Napa Valley College overlooks the Napa River and serves as a resource for the entire community. In addition to your traditional math and science classes, the school runs programs for budding winemakers and viticulturists and has a state-of-the-art teaching winery.
  * **Welcome to Napa Valley Sign** \- Erected in 1949—73 years after Beringer was founded—the iconic Welcome to Napa Valley Sign lets you know you’ve arrived. Most days, you’ll see groups of visitors making a pit stop for photos and enjoying the beautiful scenery.
  * **Mustard Season** \- Bright yellow mustard blooms carpet the valley floor every January, banishing the winter greys and bringing the first signs of a new growing season. The blooms aren’t just for show; they help recharge the soil and get rid of pests among other important jobs. Winemaker Ryan Rech and his team rely on the yearly mustard bloom to prevent soil erosion and eliminate the need for pesticides.
  * **Harvest** \- Every August, the valley becomes a hive of excited energy as vineyard crews get to work harvesting the year’s vintage. The air is infused with the smell of grapes and the anticipation is high as winemakers race against nature to pick the grapes at peak ripeness. 
  * **The Grape Crusher** \- Standing 15 feet tall, the grape crusher statue is impossible to miss as you make your way into the city of Napa. It’s the largest sculpture cast west of the Mississippi and a reminder of Napa’s rich winemaking history.
