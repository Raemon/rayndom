A deeply colored and rich wine with substantial backbone and structure will make this 2017 vintage continue to reward after years of careful cellaring. With bright notes of black currant and blackberries and a lush, juicy mouthfeel, this wine is also very approachable in its youth. Complex layers of black fruit and notes of cocoa powder, graphite and light smoky oak mingle well with notes of espresso and vanilla. The ripe tannins support a full structure with balanced acidity leaving a lingering, elegant finish.

> “This shows really beautiful purity of fruit with polish and sophistication. The currant and cassis aromas are so enticing and really reflect the name of the wine. Medium to full body. Extremely fine tannins. Shows a level of freshness and agility that caresses the palate. Delicate and beautiful. Mostly Howell Mountain. Drink or hold.” - JamesSuckling.com, February 2020

> "The 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon Private Reserve is brilliant, with a ripe, powerful style that’s going to age gracefully. Deep blackcurrants, dark chocolate, scorched earth, and graphite notes all emerge from this concentrated, powerful Cabernet that has ripe tannins, a big, rich mid-palate, and a great finish. It’s going to benefit from 3-5 years of bottle age and keep for upwards of two decades with no issues." -JebDunnuck.com, February 2020

Varietal Cabernet Sauvignon

#### Winemaking

The Beringer reserve vineyards offer Cabernet Sauvignon of such quality that a minimalist approach to winemaking has long defined this special blend. Each vineyard is vinified separately and monitored carefully from the moment the fruit comes into the winery at Harvest. Tailored pump-over techniques are used for optimal extraction, and the wine is aged in hand-selected, custom-toasted barrels of new French oak (80% new). Each lot was aged for 20 months before selection of the final blend, to allow each vineyard to express the depth of its unique terroir.

####  Vintage 

The year began with abundant rainfall, followed by a mild Spring. A Labor Day weekend heatwave kicked harvest into high gear followed by a cool weather break which allowed sugar levels to return to optimum normal level. By October nearly 90 percent of our grapes were harvested when fierce winds fueled the 2017 firestorm. Napa Valley's winemakers remain committed to making some the world's finest wines and early articles about the 2017 vintage describe the wines with words such as "finesse," "great complexity of flavor," and "elegant.

####  Vineyards 

Steinhauer Ranch (24%), Bancroft Ranch (21%), Pauli (12%) and Marc Mondavi Ranch (5%) vineyards atop Howell Mountain provide the foundation for the 2017 blend. Fruit from the St. Helena Home Vineyard (15%) and Chabot Vineyard (9%) add the warmth of the St. Helena appellation. Exceptional fruit from Oakville’s Borrow Pit Vineyard (6%) join contributions from Spring Mountain’s Marston Vineyard (5%), Diamond Mountain’s Armstrong Ranch (2%) and Mount Veeder’s Derr Family Vineyard (1%). Grapes for the 2017 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon were harvested between September 15th and October 24th.
