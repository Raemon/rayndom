TREASURY WINE ESTATES AMERICAS COMPANY (‘TWE’) MAKES NO WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

### DISCOUNT POLICY

Unless clearly stated on an offer our discounts, promotions, or coupons are not combinable with each other.

### CLUB MEMBERSHIP

Beringer will ship your club wine selections directly to your home or office. No bills, no fuss, we simply charge the credit card provided on your application at the time of shipping. Please note that it is your obligation to notify Beringer of any account changes 15 days before the beginning of a shipment month. Membership is ongoing and may be cancelled with a 15 day notice after receiving your second club shipment. We request a two shipment minimum commitment to the wine club.

Due to legal restrictions, we are only permitted to ship wine to select states. Please note that verification of age and signature is required at the time of delivery. Carriers make three attempts to deliver, after which the wine is returned to Beringer. No wine will be delivered to a visibly intoxicated person, and any person unable to produce age verification forfeits the right to receive the shipment until identification is produced. In such circumstances, the order may be held in storage at a local depot until appropriate identification is produced, or it may be shipped back to the winery. If a wine shipment is shipped back to the winery, the customer is responsible for freight charges.

Wines are subject to change due to availability. Members are responsible for all taxes, shipping or handling fees, including shipments that are refused, returned or shipped to an old address. Should your club shipment be returned for any reason, the fee to re-ship would be the full rate charged by the common carrier to Beringer. If there has been some sort of error with delivery, we will be happy to work with you to resolve it.

### RETURN POLICY

We will replace any bottle of wine that is damaged, flawed, or otherwise deemed to be unsatisfactory. We may request that the customer return the unfinished portion of the original bottle for replacement along with any shipping materials and a copy of the purchase receipt. Please [contact us](/pages/contact).

### ORDER AND SHIPPING INFORMATION

Orders are processed Monday through Friday 9 am to 4 pm. Orders placed during processing hours may take up to two days to ship. Order placed on weekends and holidays may take up to an additional 3 days to ship.

Completed orders for express service placed during business hours ship within 24-48 hours.

Customers requiring specialized delivery service are encouraged to call us directly for assistance in placing the order.

Based on state availability, shipments are handled by UPS or FedEx. Unless designated by the customer, most orders are shipped via ground service.

Wine shipments require an adult (21 years or older) signature at the time of delivery. No wine will be delivered to a visibly intoxicated person, and any person unable to produce age verification forfeits their right to receive the shipment until identification is produced. In such circumstances, the order may be held in storage at a local depot until appropriate identification is produced, or it may be shipped back to us in original condition, restocked, and the purchase price refunded.

All costs associated with the returns due to unsuccessful delivery attempts will be charged to the customer.

Shipping charges include costs for third party transit and all product-handling costs. Orders are shipped following credit card authorization and settlement.

### PURCHASES FROM THIRD-PARTY RETAILERS

If you purchased one of our wines from a retailer rather than the Beringer website or winery, and you need assistance with a corked or faulty bottle, we’re happy to help. To proceed, please [contact us](/pages/contact) and provide a photo of your receipt as proof of purchase and at least one photo of the affected bottle(s).

We will follow up with you if we require additional information. If you reside in a state that permits direct shipping of wine, we can send you a replacement bottle.

_Please note: We are unable to offer refunds on wine purchased directly from third parties._  


### CONTACT US

If you have any questions about these Terms and Conditions, please [contact us](/pages/contact).
