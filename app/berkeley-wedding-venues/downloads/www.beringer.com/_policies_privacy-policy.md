Treasury Wine Estates Privacy Policy  


Treasury Wine Estates Limited and its related entities and brands (“TWE,” “we” or “us”) are committed to protecting the privacy of individuals’ personal information. This Privacy Policy applies to the information we collect about you (“personal information”) in the course of our business, including through our websites, mobile applications, and services that link to this Privacy Policy and our related marketing activities, research, and other related offline offerings operated by or on behalf of TWE (collectively, the ”Services”). Please do not provide us with your personal information if you are not of legal age to purchase alcohol in the jurisdiction where you live or if you do not agree to the terms in this policy.

This Policy applies across all jurisdictions in which TWE conducts business. Residents in various regions (for example, California and the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”)) can find additional information in region-specific subsections below. Where there is any conflict between the region-specific subsection and the generalized provisions, the region-specific subsection controls.   
This Policy applies to consumers’ personal information and not employee or applicant personal information. If you are an employee or applicant, your People and Culture or recruiting contact can provide information on TWE's employee and applicant-related privacy practices.   


### 1\. Summary

This Policy explains how TWE collects, uses, and discloses information about you, and your rights and choices with respect to such information. Below is a summary of our practices; please read the full Policy for more details: 

  * **Information we collect:** We collect information directly from you when you interact with us (e.g., when you purchase wine, sign up for mailing lists, or enter a contest), as well as automatically through the use of cookies and similar technologies. We do not knowingly collect information from individuals under the legal drinking age.
  * **Use of your information:** We use your information for a variety of purposes, including to fulfill orders, provide and personalize the Services, support website functionality, improve the Services, secure the Services, advertise and market the Services, defend and exercise our rights, and as required by law.
  * **Disclosure of information:** We disclose information to our service providers and contractors, as well as to third parties that provide advertising and advertising analytics services, and social media services. We may also disclose information in connection with a business transaction, at your direction, or as otherwise required by law.
  * **Data retention and security:** Generally, we will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, and take a variety of measures to keep that information secure.
  * **Your Rights and Choices:** Depending on where you live, you may have the right to request access to, or correction or deletion of, your information, and to opt out of “sales” and targeted advertising. You may also opt out of receiving marketing communications from us.  




Our full Policy contains additional information for residents of California and the PRC; please see below for more details.

###    
2\. Information We Collect

The information we collect about you depends on the Services you use, how you use them, and how you otherwise interact with us. We collect information when you provide it directly to us, and through automated technology when you use the Services. Although you can decide whether to provide information to TWE, in some instances, the provision of information to us is required to allow us to provide the Services. 

#### A. Information you provide to us

We collect personal information that you provide to us. This includes information you provide us when corresponding with us, entering our competitions, buying our wines, selling goods or services to us, visiting us at our cellar doors or tasting rooms, becoming a member of a wine club, or when using or registering on our websites. This category also includes information that you provide to us through TWE-branded ads on third-party websites, including social media sites.

#### B. Information collected through automated technologies

Apart from the information you give us directly, we and our vendors also automatically collect information about you when you visit our websites, including through the use of cookies, tags, pixels, web beacons, and similar automated tracking technologies. Cookies are small data files that are downloaded onto your computer when you visit a particular website. Pixels work similarly, but the information is sent to a third-party server. For purposes of this policy, we collectively refer to these tracking technologies as “cookies.” The information we and our vendors collect via cookies may include information such as:

  * technical information such as your computer’s IP address, device or cookie ID, hardware type, browser type, operating system, device identifier and screen type/resolution;
  * any search terms entered on our website;
  * general location data based on your device or IP address;
  * any technical errors or exceptions; and information about your visit such as the products you viewed or searched for, the length of your visit, time visited, page load speed, and the pages that you visited.



Cookies help us gather and store information about visitors to our websites. They help our websites remember what you chose on previous pages (to avoid having to re-enter information) and can help us to identify you as a unique visitor, tailor content based on past visitation and provide you with an optimised experience. They can also help us understand when you have found our brands or products through third-party websites.   
We use the following general categories of cookies on our websites (though the exact wording and category names may change depending on the specific TWE website you are using):

  * Essential (required);
  * Performance;
  * Functionality;
  * Targeting, advertising, or marketing;
  * Statistics;
  * Unclassified.



If you prefer not to have your non-essential cookies tracked, you can choose this option when visiting our websites. However, some parts of our websites will not function if cookies are turned off. We therefore strongly recommend that you leave cookies fully functional. For more information about cookies please see <https://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/>. For information about how to manage cookies, including how to disable cookies in most Internet browsers, [see here](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/). You can also opt-out of targeted ads from Facebook and Google by visiting  
[www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217](www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217)  
or  
<https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en-AU.>

### 3\. Our use of your information

We may use or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more of the following purposes in order to conduct our business and pursue our legitimate business interests:

  * To fulfill or meet the reason you provided the information. 
    * For example, if you provide your personal information to purchase our products, we will use that information to process and manage your order.
  * To provide, support, personalize, and develop the Services and to help us gain a better understanding of your preferences in order to improve the Services and products we offer.
  * To help maintain the safety, security, and integrity of the Services, and our business.
  * To personalize your website experience and to deliver content and product and service offerings relevant to your interests, including targeted offers and ads through our websites, third-party sites, and via email or text message (consistent with any consent elections you have made, as required by applicable law)(This article does not apply to personal information collected within the territory of the PRC).
  * To allow you to participate in interactive features of our websites and administering our promotions and competitions.  

  * To verify that you are of legal drinking age in your jurisdiction (if applicable).
  * To fulfill a contract we may have with you, such as where you make a purchase from us, sell us goods and services, or enter one of our competitions.
  * In connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory and investigative purposes as necessary (including to respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations).
  * To analyze usage of our Services and produce consumer insights (e.g., general research on our consumers; conduct consumer testing, surveys, and panels; data analytics and modeling).
  * As described to you when collecting your personal information.
  * To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of TWE's assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by TWE about our website users is among the assets transferred.
  * For other purposes for which you provide your consent.



### 4\. Our disclosure of your information

There will be times when we disclose your personal information to others for the purpose of providing services to you, to facilitate our legitimate interests or if you consent. We do so for the same reasons explained in the “Our use of your information” section, above.

We may disclose your information to:

  * Internal TWE Entities and Brands in the performance of our business and for the purposes described in the “Our use of your information” section, above. You can find a list of our brands here.
  * Service Providers who globally support our business and help us administer certain activities on our behalf, such as providing technical infrastructure services, marketing services, customer service, data hosting and management services, processing credit card payments services for us, and providing logistics and delivery services to help us deliver our products and services. The specific entities that receive your personal information will depend on why we are using the information.
  * Contractors and Third Parties, including those that provide advertising, content, or other functionality, and those that provide information technology implementations and formal audits. Third parties may collect or receive certain information about you and/or your use of the Services to provide ads (including targeted ads), content, or functionality, or to measure and analyze ad performance, on our Services or other websites or platforms.
  * Social Media Services, if you log into the Services with a social media service or if you connect a social media account with the Services. In that case, we may disclose certain of your personal information to that social media service depending on your settings. The social media service’s privacy policy then applies to their practices regarding your information.
  * Other Parties When Required by Law or As Necessary to Protect Our Users and Services including as we believe is necessary or appropriate to protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of the Services, our employees or agents or users, or to comply with applicable law or legal process, including responding to requests from public and government authorities.
  * Other Parties in Connection with a Corporate Transaction. We may disclose information we have about you in the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party, such as in the event of a merger, acquisition, or in connection with a bankruptcy reorganization, or in contemplation of or due diligence related to such a corporate transaction.
  * Otherwise With Your Consent or At Your Direction. We may also disclose information about you with third parties whenever you consent to or direct such sharing.



### 5\. How long we keep your information

We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is and how we use it. Generally, we will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes for which your personal information has been collected unless a longer retention period is required by law.

### 6\. Your rights and choices

#### A. Privacy Rights

If you reside in certain jurisdictions, including but not limited to the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, and certain US states (such as California, Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, Montana, Texas, Utah, and Virginia) you have certain rights regarding your personal information. These rights may include the following:

  * The right to access your personal information;
  * The right to rectification/correction of inaccurate personal information;
  * The right to erasure/deletion of your personal information under specific circumstances;
  * The right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to your personal information being processed on the basis of legitimate interests;
  * The right to opt out of the sale or processing of your personal information for targeted ads;
  * The right to request the restriction of processing of your personal information;
  * The right to data portability—receiving your personal information in a format that can be transmitted to another company or system—where technically feasible;
  * The right to withdraw your consent to certain types of processing;
  * The right to not be discriminated against for exercising your rights; and
  * The right to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection supervisory authority.



However, these rights may be limited, for example if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping.

If you live outside of a jurisdiction that requires these rights, we retain full discretion to extend these rights to you.

If you wish to exercise these rights please visit our [privacy portal](https://tweglobal.service-now.com/privacyportal). For information about opting out of the sale or processing for targeted ads see below.

We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to fulfilling the above requests, such as by verifying your name and email address.

In certain locations, authorized agents may submit requests on behalf of a consumer. We will verify the agent’s authority and may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request. 

In certain jurisdictions, you may have the right to appeal the denial of a request. You can do so by following the instructions in our communication with you.

Certain personal information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. In addition, we need certain types of personal information so that we can provide products and Services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access our products and Services.

#### B. Opting out of electronic marketing communications from TWE

If you receive electronic marketing communications from us, we will always provide you with an opportunity to withdraw your consent and unsubscribe from receiving further information from us by, for example, clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in the communication or sending a simple text message in response.   
Please note that even if you opt out, we may still send you email communications for transactional or legal purposes, such as updates about orders you have placed with us or notices of updates to our terms and privacy policies.

#### C. Opting out of the sale or processing for targeted ads

If you are a California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah or Virginia resident, you may opt out of the sale or processing of your personal information, including for targeted advertising, under applicable law. Targeted advertising is when we or our partners display ads to you based on your personal information that is collected across different businesses.

We and our advertising partners collect certain information from our visitors, such as device identifiers, cookies, advertising IDs, IP addresses and usage activity. We and our ad partners share this information with third parties or combine it with information from other businesses to deliver more relevant (targeted) ads to you and for related advertising activities. This activity is known as “sharing” or processing your personal information for targeted ads and may be considered “selling” your personal information under applicable law.

If you (or, where applicable, your authorized agent) would like to opt out of activities that constitute “sharing” or “selling” your personal information, please click the “Cookie Preferences” (or similarly-named) link at the bottom of our sites, click "Change your consent" and/or "Customize" (where applicable), turn off the toggle for “Advertising” or "Marketing" cookies, and click “Save Preferences” or "Allow Selection." Note, if you use a cookie blocker such as Ghostery, it may block visibility of this tool or link, including in your web footer. You may also need to submit a request through TWE’s [privacy portal](https://tweglobal.service-now.com/privacyportal). 

Even if you opt out, you will still see advertising, it just may be less relevant to you. Your preference may be lost if you clear, or your browser is set to clear, cookies. If you have enabled a legally recognized browser-based opt out preference signal (such as Global Privacy Control) on your browser, we recognize such preference in accordance and to the extent required by applicable law. You will need to turn this on for each device and browser you use.

### 7\. Security

We take appropriate measures to keep your personal information secure. We have implemented appropriate physical and electronic procedures to protect the personal information we collect.

If you have an account with us, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account details including your password, and are responsible for any activity under your account. We will not be responsible for any loss arising from your failure to comply with this obligation.

### 8\. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about our collection, use or disclosure of personal information, wish to exercise your rights in relation to data protection or you wish to make a complaint in relation to our privacy practices, please visit our [privacy portal](https://tweglobal.service-now.com/privacyportal).

If you have a complaint or concern about how we use your personal data, please contact us in the first instance and we will attempt to resolve the issue as soon as possible. You also have a right to lodge a complaint with your national data protection supervisory authority at any time.

For the purposes of the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act in the UK, the data controller is Treasury Wine Estates EMEA Ltd of Regal House, 70 London Road, Twickenham, Middlesex, TW1 3QS.

### 9\. Third Party Websites

Our websites sometimes contain links to other websites. With the exception of other sites owned by us, we do not control the privacy practices of sites reached through links from our websites. Please note that you should carefully read and agree with third party’s privacy practices before visiting third party’s website. If you have any questions about the privacy practices of those websites then you should contact the relevant companies directly.

### 10\. Children’s Privacy

TWE does not knowingly collect or disclose any personal information from children under the age of 18. If TWE learns that a child under the age of 18 has submitted personal information without parental consent, we will take reasonable measures to delete the information as soon as possible and to not use such information for any purpose, except where required or allowed by law. If you believe a child under the age of 18 has provided us with personal information, please contact us as described in Contact Us, above.

### 11\. International Users

#### A. Cross-Border Transfers

In some cases, providing the Services involves transferring your personal information to other countries (including those outside the European Economic Area) for the purposes of data processing and storage (including if applicable, to fulfil any orders you have placed with us). Depending on the location of the brand, winery or office you engage with or register with, transfers are made to Australia, USA, UK, People’s Republic of China, Singapore and other countries where we operate. We have taken steps to ensure that your personal information is appropriately protected and is processed only in accordance with this Policy.

#### B. Legal Basis for Processing

Our use of your information is described in more detail in the “Our use of your information” section, above. Where applicable under the GDPR or similar laws, the legal basis for our processing of your personal information may include any of the following:

  * Performance of a contract.
  * Consent.
  * Compliance with a legal obligation.
  * TWE's legitimate interests that are not overridden by your interests or your fundamental rights and freedoms.



### 12\. Additional Information for California Residents

If you are an eligible California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act (together, the “CCPA”) require us to provide you with specific information about our collection and use of your personal information and your rights with respect to your personal information. This California Privacy Rights Section supplements this Privacy Policy and applies solely to eligible California consumers. Any terms not defined in this section have the same meaning as defined in the CCPA.

#### A. Information We Collect

We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or device ("personal information"). In particular, TWE has collected the following categories of personal information from its consumers within the last twelve (12) months:

A. Identifiers (such as your name, email, postal address, and device identifiers);

B. Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e)) (such as postal address and telephone number);

C. Protected classification characteristics under California or federal law (such as gender);

D. Commercial information (such as products purchased through the Services);

E. Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as browsing history and interactions with our website)

F. Geolocation data (such as general location inferred from your IP address, or if you choose to interact with location-based activities, your device’s location within a “geofence”);

G. Inferences drawn from other personal information (such as inferences about your preferences, characteristics, or similar behavioral information).

H. Sensitive personal information, specifically: (1) log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account; and (2) precise geolocation information.

Please note that some of the categories of personal information described in the CCPA overlap with each other; for instance, your name is both an Identifier and a type of data described in Cal. Civil Code 1798.80(e).

TWE obtains the categories of personal information listed above directly from you (for example, from forms you complete or products and services you purchase) and/or indirectly from you (for example, via our use of cookies and similar technologies on our Website).

#### B. Use and Disclosure of Personal Information

We may use or disclose the personal information we collect for the purposes described in the “Our use of your information” Section above.

#### C. Opt Out of Selling/Sharing Personal Information

We and our advertising partners collect certain information from our visitors, such as device identifiers, cookies, advertising IDs, IP addresses and usage activity and share this information with third parties or combine it with information from other businesses to deliver more relevant (targeted) ads to you and for related advertising activities. This activity is known as “sharing” and may be considered “selling” your personal information under the CCPA.

If you (or, where applicable, your authorized agent) would like to opt out of activities that constitute “sharing” or “selling” your personal information, please click the “Cookie Preferences” (or similarly-named) link at the bottom of our sites, click "Change your consent" and/or "Customize" (where applicable), turn off the toggle for “Advertising” or "Marketing" cookies, and click “Save Preferences” or "Allow Selection." Note, if you use a cookie blocker such as Ghostery, it may block visibility of this tool or link, including in your web footer. You may also need to submit a request through TWE’s [privacy portal](https://tweglobal.service-now.com/privacyportal).

Even if you opt out, you will still see advertising, it just may be less relevant to you. Your preference may be lost if you clear, or your browser is set to clear, cookies. If you have enabled a legally recognized browser-based opt out preference signal (such as Global Privacy Control) on your browser, we recognize such preference in accordance and to the extent required by applicable law. You will need to turn this on for each browser you use.

#### D. Your California Privacy Rights

California residents have the following rights with regard to their Personal Information, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”):

  * The right to know i.e., our disclosure of categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information.)
  * The right to access specific pieces of Personal Information we maintain about you
  * The right to deletion of Personal Information
  * The right to correct inaccurate Personal Information we maintain about you



To exercise any of these rights, please visit our [Privacy Portal](https://tweglobal.service-now.com/privacyportal).

We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to fulfilling the above requests, such as by verifying your name and email address. If we are able to verify your identity, we will respond to your request to the extent we are able to and as required by law. If we cannot verify your identity, we may request additional information from you or we may deny your request. If we are unable to fulfill your request(s) in their entirety, we will provide further information to you about the reasons that we could not comply with your request.

Authorized Agents may submit requests on behalf of a California resident. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request.

Certain personal information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. In addition, we need certain types of personal information so that we can provide products and Services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access our products and Services. We do not discriminate against any consumer for exercising their rights under the CCPA.

#### E. Your Rights Under “Shine the Light”

California's "Shine the Light" law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our App that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

(b) Impact on Your Rights and Interests

If your sensitive personal information is disclosed or illegally used, it may result in damage to your personal dignity or damage to your personal or property safety.

Please be aware that we have taken strict measures to protect your sensitive personal information from disclosure or illegal use.

TWE does not collect any data or information concerning persons who are under the age of 18, which is the threshold for legally alcohol drinking and/or purchasing in the PRC. We will try to delete the relevant information as soon as we are expressly aware that the user is under the age of 18.

Please do not provide us with your personal information if you are under the age of 18. Please consciously comply with this integrity obligation so that we can better protect your personal information.

Where we process personal information for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the information until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to process your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your information indefinitely so that we can respect your request in future.
