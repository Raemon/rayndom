## Roasted Heirloom Tomato Tart with Herbed Ricotta

### Ingredients

#### For the Tart Shell

  * 1.5 cups all-purpose flour
  * 1 stick (1/2 cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * 1/4 cup ice cold water



#### For the Filling

  * 2 cups ricotta cheese
  * 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, finely chopped
  * 1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
  * 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped
  * Salt and freshly ground black pepper
  * 4-5 large heirloom tomatoes, sliced about 1/4 inch thick
  * Olive oil for drizzling
  * Balsamic glaze for drizzling (optional)



### Instructions

#### For the Tart Shell

  1. In a food processor, combine the flour and salt. Add the cold butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
  2. Gradually add the ice water and pulse until the dough comes together. You may not need all the water.
  3. Remove the dough from the food processor and shape it into a disk. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
  4. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to fit a 9-inch tart pan.
  5. Press the dough into the pan and trim any excess. Prick the bottom with a fork, line the tart with parchment paper, and fill it with pie weights or dried beans.
  6. Bake for 20 minutes, then remove the weights and parchment and bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until golden. Allow to cool.



#### For the Filling

  1. In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta, basil, parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper. Spread this mixture evenly over the cooled tart shell.
  2. Arrange the sliced tomatoes over the ricotta in a single layer. Drizzle with olive oil and season with additional salt and pepper.
  3. Bake the tart for 25-30 minutes, or until the tomatoes are roasted and the tart is heated through.
  4. Allow the tart to cool for a few minutes before slicing. Drizzle with balsamic glaze if desired and serve with a fresh green salad for a complete meal.



![Private Reserve Chardonnay](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/7266/9353/files/Beringer-1240_PRChard_840x650_ca09e8d7-2442-45ed-ae47-aeccffd2b766.jpg?v=1749780682)

## Private Reserve Chardonnay

#### 98 Points - [JamesSuckling.Com](https://www.jamessuckling.com/ "James Suckling")

Layered, rich, creamy, and complex, this luscious Chardonnay is classically Californian with expressive aromas of citrus blossom, jasmine, and lemon curd, supported by more tropical ripe flavors of white nectarine, peach, and grilled pineapple. The well-integrated oak shows notes of brioche, vanilla, and ginger spice, leading to a long, mouth-watering finish with freshness and minerality.
