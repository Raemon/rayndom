We combined Semillion and Sauvignon Blanc to create a Bordeaux White Wine blend. Chamomile flowers and citrus leap out of the glass and combine with chalky mineral notes to entice your senses. On the palate, dairy notes appear, hinting at the extended malolactic fermentation, and combine with a smooth mouthfeel creating a wine with significant body and depth. Stark acidity rounds out the flavor profile and helps to accentuate the flavors within our version of a Bordeaux classic.

####  Vintage 

Vintage 2020 was marked by late rains in the spring during bloom, and extreme lightning storms and heat spikes in mid to late August. It was a warm, dry winter and we didn't start to see rain and cold weather until the end of March. While the mild spring season gave us a great early start, the wineries of Napa Valley worked under extensive safety protocols due to the COVID pandemic. Summer brought very cool mornings and very warm days. This build-up to harvest was interrupted by two wildfires as we turned to the fall. Heat spikes continued into the middle of September. The vintage ended midway through the harvest season.
