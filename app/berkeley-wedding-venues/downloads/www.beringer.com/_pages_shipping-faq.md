This is an example of a question that a customer might ask 

This is an example of a response that you might give. It's good to be as thorough as possible in responses as that has a tendency to improve trust overall.

What if I have issues checking out? 

If you experience any difficulty during the checkout process, be sure to

  1. ensure your shipping address conforms to the alcohol shipping laws with which we must comply
  2. verify your billing address information matches what your credit card has on file
  3. if you have an account, log in using the email you used when you joined our mailing list
  4. review the information in your account profile and check that all your personal details are accurate and complete, including billing and shipping address, telephone number, preferred payment method and your account password



If you still need help, please reach out to our customer service team at [(707) 257-5771 ](tel:707-257-5771)or via email at [cs_beringer@beringer.com ](mailto:cs_beringer@beringer.com)and they will assist.

Do I need to be present to receive my wine? 

All wines must be received by an adult who is 21 years of age or older. If no one is available at your home address to receive your shipments, please ship your order to your office or another location where someone will be present. If, after three delivery attempts, your wine is returned to us, you can request that your order be shipped to a different address. Additional shipping fees will be charged to your credit card.

Can I ship to a PO Box? 

Unfortunately, no. USPS does not allow alcohol to be shipped or received, and will not receive a package from another carrier, like UPS or FedEx, to your P.O. Box.

What is Temperature Controlled Shipping? 

Eliminate heat stress - for you and your wine! Choose Temperature Control Shipping at check out and ensure your wine arrives in perfect condition. Fast facts about temperature controlled shipping:

  1. Orders placed online before 12pm PST on Tuesdays will be picked up by a temperature controlled truck that Friday. After the cutoff, your order will be held to ship the following Friday. 
  2. You will receive an email with your tracking number once the label has been created. 
  3. Your wine will travel in luxury to the nearest Hub city with temperature controlled precision. 
  4. When it arrives at the Hub city, your tracking information will be scanned by the carrier and updated in their system. At this point, you can use your tracking number to follow your package. 
  5. From your local hub it will be delivered by your preferred carrier via ground services, usually within a day or two after it arrives at the hub. Most shipments arrive on the Wednesday or Thursday following the Friday shipment.
  6. Temperature Control Shipping is available to all states we can normally ship to EXCEPT for AK, AZ, CA, HI, ID, KS, MT, ND, NE, NM, NV, OR, and WA. 



Will you ship my order to my work address? 

YES, we always recommend shipping to a business address as there is typically someone there to receive packages. In addition, orders to business addresses tend to be delivered earlier in the day.

When will I be notified if there are any issues with my order? 

You will receive an order confirmation email for any completed order and inventory will be reserved immediately. In some cases, your order may be above the quantity limits set by your ship-to state and our Customer Service team will assist you to get as much as legally possible to you. You will only be charged for wines that are shipped.

May I place one order and provide multiple shipping addresses? 

No, orders ship only as complete orders (not partial orders). If you would like one order shipped to multiple addresses, the order will need to be broken into multiple orders to satisfy multiple delivery addresses.

Will you hold my order until a future date? 

Due to limited space, we cannot hold wines nor allow for future ship dates. All orders are shipped within 3 business days of purchase.

Will you ship my wine to Alaska or Hawaii? 

Yes! We can ship to Alaska and Hawaii. Please choose from the relevant shipping options at checkout.

Will you ship my wine outside of the United States? 

At this time, we ship only to United States addresses.

Am I able to request a specific delivery day of the week, or delivery window (1-4 hours)? 

No, we cannot specify delivery times. You will receive a shipment confirmation email when your wines are shipped which will include tracking information.
