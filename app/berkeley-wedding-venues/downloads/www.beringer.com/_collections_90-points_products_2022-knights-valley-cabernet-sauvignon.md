This vintage offers bold layers of blackcurrant, plum, and boysenberry, accented by dark chocolate, sage, and hints of tobacco and spice. A warm growing season brought richness, while bright acidity and fine tannins deliver balance and a long, structured finish. Approachable now, with aging potential.

> "Perfumed aromas of red currants, lavender, fresh thyme and graphite. The palate is medium- bodied with plush tannins and balanced acidity, giving flavors of raspberry coulis, red licorice and baking spices. Very soft and delicate, with a nicely constructed backbone."

#### Technical info

Alcohol 14.5%

Varietal Cabernet Sauvignon

#### Winemaking

To maintain the unique characteristics of the different lots from various areas of the vineyard, each is monitored carefully throughout the vinification and aging process. Extended maceration extracted maximum color, aromas, and flavors from the grapes. It also developed generous tannins to enhance the lush mouthfeel of the blend. The wines were aged in French oak barrels (30% new) for 14 months, undergoing malolactic fermentation for further texture and mouthfeel development

####  Vintage 

The first half of the 2022 harvest started calm and early, with healthy vineyards offering fruit with bright acidity, fruit-forward flavors, and strong yields for white varietals and thin-skinned reds, like Pinot Noir. Then, California experienced a historic heat wave in early September that ramped up the pace of ripening, compelling a fast and furious harvest as winemakers worked to pick fruit at its best quality. Fortunately, strong vines and proactive irrigation helped many vineyards survive the heat. The second half was much more predictable with cooler temperatures through October, so that later-ripening red varieties, such as Malbec, could develop their full flavor and tannin profile.

####  Vineyards 

Located 17 miles northwest of the winery, Knights Valley vineyard spans approximately 600 acres. It features rocky, well-drained soils that are perfectly suited to Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Malbec, and Petit Verdot.
