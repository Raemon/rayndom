# Sweet Pairings for Halloween

Oct 13, 2025

![Halloween Bottle Shot](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/BlogHeader_KV_Oct.jpg?v=1769039569&width=320)

This Halloween, skip the leftover trick-or-treat stash and treat yourself to something a little more grown-up. A few gourmet sweets paired with a great glass of wine can turn an ordinary night into something indulgent and fun.

Beringer Winemaker, _Margo Van Staaveren_ has a sweet tooth of her own and loves to explore playful pairings that highlight the character of both wine and candy. Here are three of her favorite matches to try this spooky season:

### **1\. Dark Chocolate Truffle & [Knights Valley Reserve](https://www.beringer.com/products/2021-knights-valley-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon)**

_“The rich, velvety texture of dark chocolate truffles enhances the bold structure and dark fruit notes of these Cabernets. A luxurious match of intensity and elegance.” - Margo Van Staaveren_

When deep blackberry flavors and warm spice from Knights Valley meet the bitterness of dark chocolate, the result is indulgent, layered, and absolutely haunting—in the best way.

### **2\. Soft Caramel Candy & [Private Reserve Chardonnay](https://www.beringer.com/collections/private-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon/products/2023-private-reserve-chardonnay)**

_“Buttery caramel meets its match in this opulent Chardonnay. The wine’s creamy texture and hints of vanilla echo the candy’s sweetness while its acidity keeps the finish clean.” _\- Margo Van Staaveren__

Think golden caramel wrapped in silk. This pairing balances richness with freshness, making it an unexpectedly sophisticated treat.

###  **3\. Strawberry Champagne Gummy & [Mountain Rosé](https://www.beringer.com/products/2024-knights-valley-mountain-rose)**

_“A joyful pairing! The bright, fruity sparkle of Mountain Rosé lifts the juicy strawberry notes of the gummy, creating a fun and fizzy flavor burst.” _\- Margo Van Staaveren__

A playful choice that proves candy and wine don’t have to be serious to be delicious. Sweet, juicy, and lifted by bubbles, this one is as festive as Halloween itself.
