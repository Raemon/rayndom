Bancroft's forward fruit demonstrates the classic Cabernet flavor of ripe, sweet blackcurrant. The 2015 Bancroft Ranch was aged for 20 months in 65% new French oak barrels. Careful attention is paid to vineyard blocks, which are kept separate and vinified with a goal of extracting maximum flavor.

> Impressive freshness and fragrance with dark stony notes, iodine and Indian ink. Dried, roasted herbs and fresh cedary oak laced through ripe black fruits, too. The palate delivers a crisp, fresh and precise plaster-like texture. Fine but firm, long and deep black cherries, blackberries and dark plums. Some roasted coffee grounds to close. Terrific focus. Drink or hold.

####  Vintage 

Yields were down in 2015 as a result of the continuing drought and further reduced by cold weather during flowering. However, a warm summer with almost no rain allowed for optimal ripening, and the resulting harvest, while small, was of outstanding quality. Grapes are small and packed with flavor and color, creating wines with excellent extraction and structure.

####  Vineyards 

Howell Mountain rises just to the northeast of Beringer’s winery in Saint Helena, and Bancroft Ranch lies at an elevation of 1,800 feet on the western slope of the mountain. The soil here—gritty white tuff of volcanic origin—is shallow, infertile and extremely well drained. The vines produce small, intensely flavored berries with powerful, concentrated fruit flavors and thick skins that yield robust tannins. Bancroft’s forward fruit demonstrates the classic Cabernet flavor of ripe, sweet black currant.
