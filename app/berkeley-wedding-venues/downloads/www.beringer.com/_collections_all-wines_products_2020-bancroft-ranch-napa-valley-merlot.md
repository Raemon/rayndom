Deep garnet-purple in the glass, this 2019 Merlot shows deep extraction, giving a stunning impression of what is to come. On the nose, black fruit aromas of plum and currant dominate with an edge of red fruits; raspberry and boysenberry, stretching firmly over core plum notes. Herbaceous thyme notes emerge and betray the mountainous fruit origin. Secondary characteristics emerge after decanting, with aromas of clove, beef drippings, and dark chocolate. On the palate, fruit notes alongside baking spice notes and vanilla, from French oak aging. Rugged tannins support heavier fruit flavors and finishes further. Drink now or age another 10-25 years.

####  Vintage 

2020 was a combination of a warm, dry winter, late March rains, and circumstances beyond typical. Mild spring weather provided an early start, tempered by the summer’s growing season warmth and frequent heat spikes. Low rainfall, and dynamic weather set the fruit with pronounced micro-climatic and aromatic complexity. Winery working conditions were adapted with extensive safety protocols for Covid-19, and further challenges from California wildfires proved a challenge to the latter half of the vintage. Grapes were harvested late September into October. This wine shows phenolic ripeness, acidic backbone, and exceptional nuance in this challenging vintage.

####  Vineyards 

Howell Mountain rises northeast of Beringer’s winery in St. Helena, with Bancroft Ranch at 1,800 ft elevation on the western slope. The soil --gritty white tuff of volcanic origin --is shallow, and very well drained. Vines produce small, intensely flavored berries with powerful, concentrated fruit flavors and thick skins yielding robust tannins. Bancroft’s forward fruit demonstrates classic Merlot flavors.
