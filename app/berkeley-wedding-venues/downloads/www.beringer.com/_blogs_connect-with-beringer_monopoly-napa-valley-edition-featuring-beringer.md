# Monopoly - Napa Valley Edition Featuring Beringer

May 2, 2022

![Monopoly with Beringer Wines](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/BER_PR_CabSauv_with_Monopoly_Bottles_DSF5645.png?v=1769042041&width=320)

Grab your favorite Beringer wine and schedule a game night with your friends and family. This iteration of the classic game replaces Atlantic City squares with iconic wineries, historic landmarks, and local businesses across Napa Valley. This new Monopoly board is for sale just in time for the holidays!

"We’re thrilled to launch Monopoly Napa Valley Edition in time for the holidays and to celebrate one of the most beloved, culturally rich and geographically beautiful wine regions in the world," Jennifer Tripsea, a representative for the game and puzzle brand said in a statement. "We’ve spent months creating a portrayal of the area’s dynamic communities that we hope locals and visitors alike will enjoy for years to come."

"The iconic Monopoly game is an opportunity for everyone to live the Napa Valley lifestyle in the comfort of their home while enjoying our award-winning wines," Beringer Vineyards General Manager and Sr. Winemaker Ryan Rech told "GMA." "Graced with stately 19th century architecture and beautiful gardens, Beringer’s estate, including the Victorian-era Rhine House, was designated as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. Now, to be immortalized on the Monopoly game board for generations to come is not only fun but feels like another milestone for our landmark estate and allows all ages to enjoy the Napa Valley experience."

The featured wineries include Beringer, Frank Family Vineyards, Sterling Vineyards, JaM Cellars, Hall Wines, and Napa Cellars. Neighboring culinary-related businesses include Oxbow Public Market, The Model Bakery, Bounty Hunter, and La Chev Bakery. Senza Hotel, Silverado Resort, and many B&B's are featured as well as FlyWithWine, Napa Valley College, and Alta Luxury Transportation.

> "Napa Valley’s roots as a wine-growing region trace back to the early 1800s and still today it is the epitome of beautiful wine country scenery, incredible luxury properties, and legendary world class wine. Founded in 1876 by entrepreneurial German brothers Frederick, a financier, and Jacob, a winemaker, I can’t imagine a Napa Valley Monopoly board without Beringer!” - Ryan Rech, Winemaker

## Beringer Game Night Selections

The new Monopoly Napa Valley board is available at the Beringer tasting room and other local retailers in Napa Valley while supplies last. It is also available on Amazon, CVS and the Top Trumps USA.
