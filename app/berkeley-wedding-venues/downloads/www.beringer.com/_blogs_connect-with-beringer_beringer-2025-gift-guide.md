# Beringer 2025 Gift Guide

Dec 2, 2025

![Beringer 2025 Gift Guide](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/DSF9421_copy_705b7901-16c1-4c2c-840c-d9f08b5cfce8.jpg?v=1769041707&width=320)

Celebrate the season with gifts that capture the heart of Napa. From bold Cabernets to elegant Chardonnays and festive sparklings, Beringer wines bring warmth, craftsmanship, and timeless style to every holiday moment. Discover thoughtful bottles to share—or to savor yourself.

### 1 | The Grand Gesture

**[Magnum](https://www.beringer.com/collections/magnum) & Large-Format Bottles**  
Make a bold impression with a 1.5 L or larger bottle. These formats are show-stoppers at dinner tables, photo-worthy at celebrations, and perfect for sharing with groups. For the person who hosts, connects, or leads the festivities.

### 2 | The Signature Collector

**[Private Reserve](https://www.beringer.com/collections/private-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon) & [Knights Valley](https://www.beringer.com/collections/knights-valley-wine) Collections**  
These are the wines with history — multi-vintage pedigree, bold structure, refined finishes. Ideal for the wine lover, the milestone occasion, or simply someone who deserves something exceptional.

### 3 | The Thoughtful Stocking Add-On

**375 mL Options & Elegant [Gift Sets](https://www.beringer.com/collections/wine-sets)**  
Small in size, just as memorable in quality. These make excellent additions to stockings, hostess gifts, or a “just because” surprise. Add a sleek box or ribbon for instant polish.

### 4 | The Experience Gift

**[Wine Club Memberships](https://www.beringer.com/pages/gift-membership) & [Corporate Gifting](https://www.beringer.com/pages/gifting)**  
When you want to give more than a bottle — give access. Memberships include insider releases, events, and exclusives; concierge gifting handles bulk, branding, and corporate lists with ease.
