The 2019 Chabot Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon is a striking example of this storied vineyard’s signature elegance and structure. The season’s long, warm summer and extended hang time resulted in exceptional fruit development, yielding a wine with vibrant acidity, deep color, and refined tannins. Classic aromas of black currant, blackberry, and cherry unfold alongside delicate herbal notes of anise, sage, and bay leaf. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied and impeccably balanced, with layered flavors of dark fruit, espresso, and toasted walnut seamlessly integrated with fine-grained tannins. The finish is long and expressive, marked by bright acidity and a lingering complexity that highlights the finesse of this outstanding vintage. Enjoyable now with decanting, this wine promises exceptional aging potential.

####  Vintage 

The beginning of the 2019 growing season was defined by copious rainfall and mild early-season temperatures. The long summer saw very few extreme heat events with cool nights, foggy mornings, and warm days setting the stage for vibrant and expressive wines. The lingering finish to the season with its intermittent cool periods allowed the grapes abundant hang time on the vine which helped to preserve a natural freshness and finesse in the fruit. Yields overall were average to slightly below average. All in all, this was a near perfect vintage that produced exceptional fruit of bright acidity, great color, and ample soft tannin texture.

####  Vineyards 

Chabot Vineyard lies east of the Silverado Trail, just north of the road that leads up Howell Mountain to Bancroft Ranch and Steinhauer Ranch. The chunks of shiny obsidian strewn heavily through its soil give name to the locale, known as “Glass Mountain.” An underlying layer of pumice and bedrock ensures excellent drainage. The inky, highly structured, deeply flavored Cabernet from this vineyard was the first that Beringer Vineyards elected to bottle as a Private Reserve in 1977, and it continues to be a frequent component of contemporary Private Reserve vintages.
