In the glass, the 2022 Carneros Pinot Noir shines with a clear ruby hue, highlighted by subtle magenta undertones. The wine is vibrant and inviting, with enticing fruit and floral aromas that rise effortlessly from the rim. The nose is dominated by plush red fruit, showcasing fragrant notes of strawberry, raspberry, and cranberry. A subtle hint of cardamom suggests extended contact with oak during vinification. On the palate, the red fruit flavors reappear, joined by a darker, tart cherry note that wasn’t as prominent in the aroma. The tannins are present but delicate, while bright acidity enhances and sustains the fruit flavors throughout the long, satisfying finish. A true celebration of red fruit, the 2022 Carneros Pinot Noir is enjoyable now but promises to evolve beautifully over the next 5-7 years for those who choose to cellar it.

Varietal Pinot Noir

Blend 100% Pinot Noir

Appellation Carneros

Oak treatment 9 months in 100% French oak (45% new)

#### Winemaking

Our 2022 Pinot Noir is focused on clone 115, known for its bright red berry fruit notes and beautiful structure. We made our picking decisions with aromatic freshness in mind, picking at night and destemming 100% of the fruit. We kept the fruit at low temperature for three days for early extraction before initiating fermentation. Focusing on elegance and fresh fruit expression, we drained the must promptly after fermentation was complete and sent the wine straight to French oak barrels. After nine months in 45% new oak, we assembled the wine for bottling.

####  Vintage 

The winter of 2022 was warm and dry, with rain and cooler weather passing through only toward the end of March. The mild spring gave an early start to growing season, while the summer surprised us with cool mornings and warmer afternoons. As a result, the harvest yielded small berries with concentrated flavors and remarkable acidity, from which wines of exceptional balance and taste were derived.

####  Vineyards 

Grace Benoist Ranch is tucked away in the far northwest corner of the Los Carneros appellation. Unlike most Carneros vineyards, which are largely uplifted bay bottoms with clay soil composition, the soils on Grace Benoist Ranch are volcanic in origin. This site’s well- draining, rocky upland soil and location close to the Pacific Ocean and San Pablo Bay make it an ideal place to grow Burgundian varieties. The vineyard is certified sustainable as part of the Napa Green program, with wildlife corridors, raptor roosts and owl boxes abundant throughout the ranch.
