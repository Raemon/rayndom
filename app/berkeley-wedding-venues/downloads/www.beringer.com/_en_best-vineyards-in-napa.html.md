##  Napa Valley's Best Vineyards 

##  A carefully cultivated diverse portfolio of prized vineyards 

In 1875, Jacob and Frederick Beringer purchased 215 acres of prime Napa Valley land, establishing Beringer as a key player among the few wineries in operation at that time. Since then, Beringer has carefully cultivated a diverse portfolio of prized vineyards across many Napa Valley appellations. These vineyards range from the highest hills in Napa to the valley floor behind our historic winery.

![](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/files/BER_KV_Vineyard_0080.jpg?v=1750874589&width=320)

To this day, the sense of innovation and exploration is honored at Beringer

**in our unending drive to be a leader in emerging region development, sustainable farming practices and vineyard care. Each Beringer vineyard is cultivated based on its distinctive soil, climate and terrain characteristics.**

St. Helena AVA 

#### Bale Lane Vineyard

Located in the warmer mid-valley area of Napa Valley, the well-drained soils of Bale Lane produce excellent full-flavored Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon.

#### Chabot Vineyard

The obsidian-laden Chabot Vineyard is located on the eastern slope of Napa Valley. The Chabot vines produce superlative Cabernet Sauvignons, deep in color, rich in flavor, and with a suggestion of mint. In 1977, the Cabernet from these 31-acres became the first bottled as Private Reserve.

#### St. Helena Home Vineyard

This vineyard was part of the original 215 acres Jacob Beringer purchased in 1875. The Cabernet Sauvignon planted on the sloped sedimentary soil of this 48-acre vineyard has been a key component of our Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon since 1982.

Howell Mountain AVA 

#### Bancroft Ranch Vineyard

This beautiful, mountainous vineyard covers 89 acres of nutrient-poor, rocky soils at 1,800 feet, and produces the intense Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc that we use in our Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon.

#### Steinhauer Ranch

At 1,800 feet on Howell Mountain, this 36-acre vineyard of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc sits above the fog, enjoying cool mountain temperatures and high solar radiation. The vineyard is named in honor of Beringer's longtime vineyard manager Bob Steinhauer.

#### Pauli Vineyard

The 16-acres of restrictive volcanic soils at 1,600 feet produce intense and structured grapes. Fruit from Pauli Vineyard was first used in the 2009 Private Reserve blend.

Knights Valley AVA 

#### Sonoma County

Beringer has owned and farmed its vineyards in Knights Valley since the mid-1960s. The vineyard is located 17 miles north of the winery, in the northeastern corner of Sonoma County, and features volcanic, well-drained soils that are perfect for growing high-quality wine. In 1983, Knights Valley was approved as a new American Viticultural Area (AVA). The Knights Valley designation was first used on a Beringer label in 1974.

Not only has Knights Valley proved an exemplary producer of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon Blanc, it has also an excellent combination of terrain, microclimates and soils for a variety of experiments in viticulture that inform Beringer's finest wines and will continue to do so for vintages to come.

##  Other Napa AVAs 

## 

#### Gamble Ranch Vineyard, Oakville

The rocky land of Gamble Ranch emanates from the rich fan of sedimentary soil of Rector Creek. This produces grapes of maturity and intensity well-suited to Chardonnay, Merlot, Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon.

#### Big Ranch Road Vineyard, Oak Knoll

Located in the cool southern region of Napa Valley, Big Ranch Road, with shallow, gravelly soil of low fertility, produces Chardonnay, Merlot and Pinot Noir with full, rich flavors and excellent structure.

#### Lampyridae Vineyard, Mt. Veeder

Lampyridae, which means "firefly" in Latin, sits on Mount Veeder at approximately 2,400 feet. At this elevation, the vineyard is high above the fog layer, so it gets longer hours of sunshine and warmer nights, but days are cooler than the lower elevation vineyards. The grapes that grow in this ashy soil showcase incredible depth and intensity.

#### Marston Ranch Vineyard, Spring Mountain

Marston Ranch is a contiguous, multi-level string of smaller vineyards situated in the Spring Mountain appellation west of St. Helena. The volcanic and low fertility soil of this 33-acre mountain vineyard is highly regarded for both Rhone and Bordeaux varietals, primarily Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah.

#### Stanly Ranch Vineyard, Carneros

Located just a half-mile north of the San Pablo Bay in the prestigious Carneros appellation, the shallow, clay-loam soils and cool climate of Stanly Ranch Vineyard are ideal for growing Chardonnay and Pinot Noir grapes.

#### Yountville Vineyard, Yountville

The clay-loam soils of this vineyard in the southern area of Napa Valley produce Chardonnay with full, rich flavors and excellent structure.
