The 2021 Private Reserve is exemplary of a tremendous Napa Valley vintage, showcasing an exuberant bouquet of fresh violets, alongside a rich core of dark berry fruits supported by subtle notes of graphite. This vintage has a beautiful intensity with notes of blackberry, blackcurrant, and dark plum enveloped by structured, velvety tannins, that lead to warm baking spiced notes of vanilla, clove, and cedar, a tribute to the well-integrated oak. The generous palate provides a focused structure supported by a bright line of fresh acidity, finishing long and sumptuous with lovely fruit expression. Full-bodied, plentiful, polished, and sure, to please, it will continue to evolve and unfold as it ages over the next few decades.

James Suckling, JamesSucking.com

> “So much dark berry, dried berry, matchstick and iodine here. Plus intense aromas of black currants and black berries. So floral. Full-bodied with firm and compacted tannins that are super polished and balanced. Very long and linear. The tightness, focus and complexity harks back to the 1990s but the purity and transparency is today. September 2024 release. 80% cabernet sauvignon, 12% cabernet franc, 6% merlot, and 2% malbec. Best after 2026.”

Antoni Galloni, Vinous, December 2024

> "The 2021 Private Reserve is the most refined of the 2021s from Beringer. The aromatics alone are so alluring. There's 12% Cabernet Franc in the blend this year, and that comes through loud and clear. Crushed flowers, espresso, mint, licorice and red/purplish fruit all grace this silky, super-polished offering." 

Antoni Galloni, Vinous, December 2024

#### Winemaking

The Beringer reserve vineyards offer Cabernet Sauvignon fruit of such high quality that a minimalist approach to winemaking has long defined this special blend. Each vineyard is vinified separately and monitored carefully from the moment the fruit comes into the winery at harvest. Tailored pump-over techniques are used for optimal extraction and the wine is aged in hand-selected, custom-toasted French oak barrels (64% new). Each lot was aged for 22 months before selection of the final blend, to allow each vineyard to express the depth of its unique terroir.

####  Vintage 

The 2021 growing season started early, with extended periods of sunny weather and late, but much-needed rain. Because of low humidity, high heat, and high winds that began in early May, it was expected to be a drought year. However, it turned more seasonal, with normal temperatures in the summer. Even ripening and lower yields led to one of the earliest harvest starts with the grapes showing intense fruit flavor development. Once harvest began, we saw clear skies through September and well into October before some early rain. As with previous vintages of Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, each vineyard lot is closely monitored during the ripening period to determine the ideal pick time. Grapes for this 2021 Private Reserve was picked between September 15 and October 4.

####  Vineyards 

The 2021 Private Reserve is primarily crafted from Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced from four premium appellations within Napa Valley. Our St. Helena Home Vineyard estate and Chabot Vineyard, also in St. Helena, provide a core of dark red berry fruit, supported by a lifted floral bouquet, as well as round, rich character and warmth. Our Howell Mountain vineyards, Steinhauer Ranch, and Bancroft Ranch, provide structure and depth. Additional sourcing from Borrow Pit Vineyard at Gamble Ranch in Oakville, as well as Lampyridae Vineyard in Mt. Veeder, rounds out the blend. The blending varietals, Malbec and Merlot, are sourced from Bancroft Ranch in Howell Mountain, which provides structure and supple dark fruit. The Cabernet Franc was sourced from Steinhauer Ranch and Bancroft Ranch in Howell Mountain.
