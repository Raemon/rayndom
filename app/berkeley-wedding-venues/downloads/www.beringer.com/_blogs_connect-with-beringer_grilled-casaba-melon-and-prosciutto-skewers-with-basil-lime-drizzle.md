# Grilled Casaba Melon and Prosciutto Skewers with Basil-Lime Drizzle

Aug 11, 2025

![Grilled Casaba Melon and Prosciutto Skewers with Basil-Lime Drizzle](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/GrilledSkws_RosePairing_1000x650_81d342c2-78bc-40ec-837e-61ee17f33ee5.jpg?v=1769042503&width=320)

## Paired with Knights Valley Mountain Rosé

Prep Time: 15 mins | Cook Time: 6 mins | Serving Size: 8-10 Skewers

The classic sweet and salty pairing of grilled melon and prosciutto gets a bright twist with creamy mozzarella and a basil-lime drizzle. It’s the perfect party snack, easy to serve, full of flavor, and satisfies every craving in one bite. Paired with the 2024 Beringer Knights Mountain Valley Rosé, it’s absolutely divine and sure to be a hit.

### Ingredients

#### For the Skewers

  * 1 Casaba melon (or substitute cantaloupe or honeydew), cut into 1-inch cubes
  * 8 thin slices of prosciutto, halved lengthwise
  * 1/2 cup fresh mozzarella balls (bocconcini), drained
  * Wooden or metal skewers (8-10)



#### For the Basil-Lime Drizzle

  * 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
  * 1 teaspoon lime zest
  * 1 tablespoon honey
  * 3 tablespoons olive oil
  * 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, finely chopped
  * Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste



#### For Garnish

  * Extra basil leaves, whole or torn
  * Lime wedges



### Instructions

#### Prepare the Skewers

Thread the melon cubes, prosciutto (folded), and mozzarella balls alternately onto the skewers. Repeat until all ingredients are used.

Brush the melon cubes lightly with olive oil to prevent sticking.

#### Grill the Skewers

Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium heat.

Place the skewers on the grill and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until the melon is lightly charred and the prosciutto begins to crisp. Remove from the grill and set aside.

#### Make the Basil-Lime Drizzle

In a small bowl, whisk together lime juice, lime zest, honey, olive oil, and chopped basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

#### Assemble and Serve

Arrange the skewers on a serving platter. Drizzle generously with the basil-lime sauce.

Garnish with extra basil leaves and lime wedges for a fresh, summery touch.
