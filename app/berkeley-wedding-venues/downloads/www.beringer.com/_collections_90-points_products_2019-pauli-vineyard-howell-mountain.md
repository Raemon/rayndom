A deep ruby hue hints at the wine’s intensity, while the nose reveals layers of dark plum, cassis, and blackberry, accented by warm notes of cinnamon and clove. The palate is bold and structured, with firm tannins and bright acidity supporting flavors of black cherry, cocoa, and espresso, with a touch of vanilla and oak spice. Full-bodied and concentrated, the wine finishes long and expressive, showcasing both power and finesse. While enjoyable now with decanting, this wine promises remarkable aging potential for decades to come.

####  Vineyards 

Pauli Vineyard is located on Howell Mountain. The 15-acre vineyard has volcanic-based soils that are restrictive and thus foster grapes of great intensity and structure. Pauli Vineyard first appeared in the Private Reserve blend at the 2009 vintage. Pauli Cabernet shows a luscious fruit core from the outset, accentuated by ripe tannins.
