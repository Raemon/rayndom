Deep Ruby in the glass, medium-bodied and decadent, this Winery Exclusive Merlot exudes dark blue and red fruit flavors. On the nose, aromas of ripe raspberry, blueberry fruit compote and red cherry are present alongside a hint of vanilla. On the palate the blue and red fruit mesh and intertwine with a healthy acidity helping to enliven the mid palate flavors. Incredibly well-balanced, the palate is soft and lush with flavors of baking spices and light nutmeg. On the finish, a light note of mocha lingers and then sends you on your way. Cellar for up to 5-6 years with prime drinking beginning in 2022-2023.

#### Technical info

Alcohol 14.8%

Varietal Merlot

#### Winemaking

The merlot was harvested from the Big Ranch vineyard in the Oak Knoll AVA in early September. The fruit was picked around 24°Bx when the ripe fruit flavors were most present but before the acids began to drop, maintaining a natural, juicy acidity. Fermentation was in steel at moderate temperature to retain the fruit character before barreling down in 100% French oak, 38% new, all integrated together in an 18-month aging period

####  Vintage 

The 2020 vintage was a combination of a warm, dry winter, late March rains, and incidental circumstance beyond the typical season. The mild spring weather provided a great early start which was later tempered by the warmth of the summer growing season and the frequent heat spikes. 2020 with its low rainfall, low yields and dynamic weather had set the stage for fruit with pronounced micro-climatic and aromatic complexity. While vineyard and winery working conditions were adapted at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic with extensive safety protocols, further challenges were manifested by wildfires across California that would prove an even greater challenge to the latter half of the vintage. All estate fruit was continuously evaluated and only those sites unaffected were harvested. The limited supply of the resulting wines shows all the phenolic ripeness, acidic tension and exceptional nuance of this challenging vintage
