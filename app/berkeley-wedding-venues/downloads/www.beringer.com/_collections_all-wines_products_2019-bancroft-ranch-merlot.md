Deep garnet in color, the Bancroft Ranch Merlot is an alluring and expressive wine from an incredible vineyard on the slopes of Howell Mountain. On the aromatic nose, ripe dark berry fruit notes come forward with notes of blackberry, black cherry, and licorice. On the palate, macerated blackberries, black cherry compote, and dark plum are supported by a rich density. Soft, refined tannins create a defined structure where the fruit and oak characters seamlessly interweave together. The lengthy finish is mouthwateri.ng and supple. Perfect for cellaring and aging, this wine will also drink beautifully upon release.

#### Technical info

Alcohol 15.1%

Varietal Merlot

Blend 100% Merlot

Appellation Napa

Oak treatment Aged 20 months in 100% French oak (64% new)

#### Winemaking

The Bancroft Ranch Merlot was picked at peak phenolic and sugar ripeness. The block was split into multiple small-lot fermentations to create layers of complexity that highlight the unique terroir and soil profiles of that section of the ranch. Extraction was done upfront and early in the fermentation to capture the fine skin tannins and rich color. Fermentation, done in this way, allows for greater polymerization of the tannin and color components which greatly improves the wines’ ability to mature in bottle for years. The wine was aged in medium-plus toasted French Nevers oak barrels (64% new) for 20 months. The extended time in barrel helped to soften the big, bold tannin of the mountain fruit and to allow the aromatics of the oak and the ripe fruit to integrate.

####  Vintage 

The beginning of the 2019 growing season was defined by copious rainfall and mild, early-season temperatures. The long summer saw very few extreme heat events with cool nights, foggy mornings, and warm days setting the stage for vibrant and expressive wines. The lingering finish to the season with its intermittent cool periods allowed the grapes abundant hangtime on the vine, helping to preserve a natural freshness and finesse in the fruit. Yields overall were average to slightly below average. All in all, this was a near perfect vintage that produced exceptional fruit of bright acidity, great color, and ample soft tannin texture.

####  Vineyards 

The Bancroft Ranch Vineyard is located at an elevation of 1,800 feet on Howell Mountain, in a growing area with well-drained, white tufa volcanic soils. In 1984, Howell Mountain was the first area within the Napa Valley appellation to be declared a separate viticultural area (AVA) for the distinct characteristics of its wine grapes. Bancroft Ranch produces clusters with small berries whose high skin-to-pulp ratio results in well-structured wines with concentrated flavors that are enhanced by the climate. The vineyard is about five to 10 degrees cooler than the valley floor but still experiences more hours of sunshine over the course of a day because it lies above the fog line. This allows for both extended hang time and slow, even flavor development. Beringer has been crafting a vineyard-designated Bancroft Ranch Merlot since the 1987 vintage.
