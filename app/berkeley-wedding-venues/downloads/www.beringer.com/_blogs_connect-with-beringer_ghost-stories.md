# Tales from the Rhine House & Beyond

Oct 9, 2025

![Tales from the Rhine House & Beyond](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/New_Rhine_House_Oct10.jpg?v=1760033627&width=320)

With nearly 150 years of history, it’s no surprise that Beringer Vineyards has collected a few ghost stories along the way. Over the years, our team has experienced moments that can’t quite be explained, mysterious footsteps, glasses moving on their own, and even apparitions. Whether you believe in the paranormal or not, these reoccurring stories add a touch to Napa Valley’s oldest continuously operating winery. Read below the few tales our team has experienced:

**Footsteps in the Caves**  
Mykee Ramos, Assistant Hospitality Manager, recalls a chilling experience while closing the caves for the night. “ _I heard footsteps further into the tunnel and thought it was one of my associates hiding. But then I got a text from both of them saying they were already heading out. The footsteps continued, so I made a very quick and swift exit._ ”

---|---  
  
**Frederick’s Poltergeist**  
In the Rhine House, team members have often heard a wine glass fall and roll across the floor. Strangely, the glass never breaks, and it always seems to come from the center of the table. No one can ever explain how it happens. Many now connect this recurring mystery to the legend of _Frederick’s Poltergeist,_ a story that has been told for years.  


**'Good Night House'**  
Members of the Culinary Team have reported seeing apparitions in the executive dining room, often while preparing early in the morning or closing late at night. “ _They never come across as hostile, but it’s enough that we’ve started a tradition,”_ one team member explained._“When the last lights are turned off, we always say, ‘Good night house._ ’”![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/7266/9353/files/BER_RHFountain_ChuckORear_2009_genuse.jpg?v=1758906947)

**The Rhine House Attic**  
Several team members have remarked on a mysterious glow coming from the Rhine House attic. “ _On multiple occasions, we’ve noticed a light shining upstairs at night,”_ one said._“No one recalls going up there, and the space is rarely used.”_![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/7266/9353/files/RhineHousewGazebo300dpi.jpg?v=1758906947)
