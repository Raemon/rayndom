# Ahi Tuna Tacos Inspired by St. Helena’s Favorite Roadside Restaurant

Jun 17, 2025

![Beringer Vineyards Ahi Tuna Tacos](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/1000X650_BER_Ahi_Tacos_bbfff306-c809-49eb-b189-31d9f441917a.png?v=1769042487&width=320)

## A Perfect Pairing with Beringer's Private Reserve Chardonnay

If you’ve visited us in Saint Helena, you’ve probably dined at or at least heard of [Gott’s Roadside](https://www.gotts.com/ "Gott's Roadside Website"). It’s a Napa mainstay and a must-try if you’re in town. While it’s known for its burgers, the hidden gem of the menu is the ahi tuna tacos. With chunks of fresh tuna, a spicy sauce and fresh avocado, it’s one of the best dishes Napa has to offer.

In honor of everyone’s favorite roadside spot and California wine month, we decided to whip up our own version of the iconic tacos. They go perfectly with the refreshing notes in our Private Reserve Chardonnay and together, make for the perfect end of summer meal.

## Ahi Tuna Tacos

### Ingredients

#### The Tuna

  * 1 lb fresh ahi tuna steaks
  * 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  * 1 teaspoon sesame oil
  * 1 teaspoon lime juice
  * 1 teaspoon grated ginger
  * Salt and pepper to taste
  * 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (for searing)



#### The Slaw

  * 1 cup shredded purple cabbage
  * 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
  * 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
  * 1 tablespoon lime juice



#### The Sauce

  * 1/4 cup mayonnaise
  * 1 tablespoon (or more) Sriracha
  * 1 teaspoon honey or agave syrup



#### The Rest 

  * 8 small corn tortillas, warmed
  * Sliced avocado
  * Lime wedges



### Instructions

#### Prepare the Ahi tuna

In a bowl, mix together the soy sauce, sesame oil, lime juice, grated ginger, salt and pepper.

Cut the tuna into bite-sized squares.

Place the tuna pieces in the marinade and coat evenly. Let marinate for about 15-20 minutes.

#### Make the slaw

In a bowl, combine the shredded purple cabbage, chopped cilantro, rice vinegar, lime juice, salt and pepper. Toss until well combined. Set aside to allow the flavors to meld.

#### Prepare the sauce

In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, Sriracha, and honey (or agave syrup) until well combined. Adjust the Sriracha amount to your preferred level of spiciness.

#### Sear the Ahi tuna

Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat.

Place the marinated tuna in the hot skillet. Sear for about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until the tuna is seared on the outside but still rare on the inside. Cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the tuna.

#### Assemble the Tacos

Spread a spoonful of the Sriracha mayo sauce onto each warm corn tortilla.

Place a few pieces of seared Ahi tuna on top of the sauce.

Top with the slaw and sliced avocado and squeeze fresh lime juice over the toppings.

## Private Reserve Chardonnay

#### 98 Points - [JamesSuckling.Com](https://www.jamessuckling.com/ "James Suckling Website")

Layered, rich, creamy, and complex, this luscious Chardonnay is classically Californian with expressive aromas of citrus blossom, jasmine, and lemon curd, supported by more tropical ripe flavors of white nectarine, peach, and grilled pineapple. The well-integrated oak shows notes of brioche, vanilla, and ginger spice, leading to a long, mouth-watering finish with freshness and minerality.
