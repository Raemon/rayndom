A ruby red color with tinges of violet hint at the depth of this Cabernet Sauvignon. On the nose, aromas of warm dark fruit are accompanied by spicy notes of cocoa and vanilla. A firm structure and fine-grained tannins create a mouthfeel that is full and luscious at the same time. On the palate, an incredible freshness shines through with tastes of ripe blueberries and blackberries.

> “Lovely minty, rhubarb and currant aromas with some citrus rind and mushrooms. It all follows through to a medium body with lovely, fine tannins. Fresh and vivid. 99% cabernet sauvignon and 1% merlot. Drinkable now, but even better in 2024.” - James Suckling, May 4, 2022

Beringer Distinction Series wines allow Senior Winemaker Ryan Rech to take risks and explore new, innovative ways of working with our unique vineyard sites in a particular vintage. The Beringer Distinction Series Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is crafted to reflect the outstanding strength and diversity of the Napa Valley appellation.

####  Vintage 

The beginning of the 2019 growing season was defined by copious rainfall and late soil moisture. The long, warm summer saw very few extreme heat events, with foggy mornings setting the stage for vibrant and expressive wines. The long, relatively mild finish to the season, not without its moments of unpredictability, helped to preserve freshness and finesse in the fruit with abundant hang time teasing out great color, structure and soft tannins. Volume is looking to be about average to a little less than average. All in all, exceptional fruit with bright acidity and ample texture promises an amazing vintage.

####  Vineyards 

Half of the fruit for this wine originated from Howell Mountain vineyards, including Bancroft Ranch (25%), Marc Mondavi (15%), and Steinhauer Ranch (10%). The other half came from Marston Vineyard (22%) on Spring Mountain, Derr Family Vineyard (18%) near the peak of Mt. Veeder, and Helena Home Vineyard (10%) on the warm valley floor.
