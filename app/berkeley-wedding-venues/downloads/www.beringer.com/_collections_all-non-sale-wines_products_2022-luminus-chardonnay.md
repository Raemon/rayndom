This enchanting vintage opens with a delicate nose of Meyer lemon, citrus peel, apple blossom, and perfumed jasmine. On the palate, the fruit is bright and lively with notes of lemon curd, Asian pear, and zesty apple, supported by a flinty, savory mineral character. Medium-bodied with a round, balanced, and elegant texture, a fresh line of acidity drives length and offers a mouthwateringly crisp, refreshing finish. The nuanced French oak treatment offers a lifted brioche toastiness while the bâttonage (lees stirring) adds a richer, creamier mouthfeel that is silky and viscous. Thirst-quenching and quaffable on its own, it’s also an ideal accompaniment to lighter fare and savory treats.

#### Technical info

Alcohol 13.5%

Varietal Chardonnay

Blend 100% Chardonnay

Oak treatment Eight months in (10% new) French Oak

#### Winemaking

Each lot for this wine was kept separate. After sending the fruit directly to the press, the juice was fermented in French oak barrels (10% percent new). The lees were stirred every other month to integrate the subtle oak notes and to develop a polished texture. Our winemakers focused on showcasing the unique characteristics of this premium-quality Oak Knoll Chardonnay by crafting the final blend after eight months of aging in French oak barrels.

####  Vintage 

The first half of the 2022 harvest started calm and early, with healthy vineyards offering bright acidity, fruit-forward flavors, and strong yields. Then in early September, California experienced a historic heat wave that ramped up the pace of ripening, compelling a fast-and-furious harvest as winemakers worked to pick fruit at its best quality. Fortunately, strong vines and proactive irrigation helped many vineyards survive the heat. The second half was much more predictable with cooler temperatures through October. The grapes for this wine were picked between August 24 and September 16.

####  Vineyards 

Luminus is a single-vineyard Chardonnay from Big Ranch Vineyard in the Oak Knoll AVA. Located on the valley floor and at the southern end of Napa Valley, Big Ranch is an ideal location for this style of Chardonnay. The heavy clay soils, along with the cooling influence of San Pablo Bay and the nearby Napa River, preserve nice acidity and minerality in the grapes. A selection of Burgundian clones which show excellent early development provides an elegant complexity and fruit weight to the blend.
