Aug 11, 2025

![Balsamic Pear and Gorgonzola Salad Pairing](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/KN_21_blogheader_1000x650_26d5ca73-489d-4928-bc6b-dddae91533de.jpg?v=1756243179&width=320)

## Paired with Knights Valley Cabernet Sauvignon

Prep Time: 10-15 mins | Cook Time: 5 Mins (For Toasting Walnuts) | Serving Size: 4-6

A delicious combination of ripe pears, Gorgonzola, toasted walnuts, and dried cranberries, all layered over fresh greens and topped with a tangy-sweet balsamic vinaigrette. This salad is a perfect way to enjoy seasonal summer produce—and even better when paired with a glass of 2022 Beringer Knights Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. Its bold, fruit-forward character brings out the best in every bite, making this salad your new favorite dish. Get the recipe details below. Bon appétit!

### Ingredients

  1. 6 cups mixed salad greens (such as arugula, spinach, and leaf lettuce)
  2. 2 ripe pears, sliced thinly
  3. 1/2 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
  4. 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, toasted
  5. 1/4 cup dried cranberries
  6. 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
  7. 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
  8. 1 tablespoon honey
  9. Salt and pepper to taste



### Instructions

  1. In a small skillet over medium heat, toast the chopped walnuts until fragrant and lightly browned, about 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
  2. In a large salad bowl, combine the mixed salad greens, sliced pears, crumbled Gorgonzola cheese, toasted walnuts, and dried cranberries.
  3. In a small bowl, whisk together the extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and honey until well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  4. Drizzle the balsamic dressing over the salad and toss gently to coat all the ingredients evenly.
  5. Serve the salad immediately or refrigerate for later. Enjoy!



## 93 Points 2022 Knights Valley Cabernet Sauvignon

“Perfumed aromas of red currants, lavender, fresh thyme and graphite. The palate is medium- bodied with plush tannins and balanced acidity, giving flavors of raspberry coulis, red licorice and baking spices. Very soft and delicate, with a nicely constructed backbone. Drink or hold.” — JamesSuckling.com, January 2025
