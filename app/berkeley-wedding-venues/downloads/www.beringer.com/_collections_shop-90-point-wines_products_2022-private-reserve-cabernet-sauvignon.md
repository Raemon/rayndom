The 2022 vintage beautifully highlights our mountain vineyards. Intricately layered, it opens with black currant, cassis, and ripe black cherry woven seamlessly with black raspberry, crushed violets, subtle dried sage, holiday spice, and cedar. The palate is full-bodied and polished, with velvety tannins and a vibrant core of acidity. Dark flavors of blackberry, black plum, and boysenberry are complemented by savory black olive, espresso, and black ochre. An undercurrent of sweet oak spice and brown butter caramel brings depth and intrigue without overshadowing the fruit purity. The finish is long and textural, promising continued evolution in the bottle.

Varietal Cabernet Sauvignon

#### Winemaking

The Beringer reserve vineyards offer Cabernet Sauvignon of such high quality that a minimalist approach to winemaking has long defined this special blend. Each vineyard is vinified separately and monitored carefully from the moment the fruit comes into the winery at Harvest. Tailored pump-over techniques are used for optimal extraction, and the wine is aged in hand-selected, custom-toasted barrels of new French oak (58% new). Each lot was aged for 21 months before selection of the final blend, to allow each vineyard to express the depth of its unique terroir.

####  Vintage 

The first half of the 2022 harvest started calm and early, with healthy vineyards offering fruit with bright acidity, fruit-forward flavors, and strong yields for white varietals and thin-skinned reds,like Pinot Noir. Then, California experienced a historic heat wave in early September that ramped up the pace of ripening, resulting in a fast and furious harvest as winemakers worked to pick fruit at its best quality. Fortunately, strong vines and proactive irrigation helped many vineyards survive the heat. The second half was much more predictable with cooler temperatures through October, so that later-ripening red varieties, such as Petit Verdot, could develop their full flavor and tannin profile.

####  Vineyards 

The 2022 Private Reserve is primarily crafted from Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced from four premium appellations within Napa Valley. Our Howell Mountain vineyards shine in this blend – most notably Steinhauer Ranch and Bancroft Ranch—which contribute structure and depth. Our estate vineyards in St. Helena—Home Vineyard and Chabot Vineyard—provide a core of dark red berry fruit, supported by a lifted floral bouquet, as well as round, rich character and warmth. Additional fruit from Borrow Pit Vineyard at Gamble Ranch in Oakville and Lampyridae Vineyard on Mt. Veeder rounds out the blend. The blending varietals are also sourced from premium vineyard sites. Cabernet Franc comes from Steinhauer Ranch and Bancroft Ranch in Howell Mountain. Petit Verdot, Merlot and Malbec are sourced from Bancroft Ranch in Howell Mountain, contributing structure and supple dark fruit.
