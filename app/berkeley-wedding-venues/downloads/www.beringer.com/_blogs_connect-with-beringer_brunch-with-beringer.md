# Brunch with Beringer

Jun 17, 2025

![Brunch with Beringer](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/1000X650_BerBrunch05_888f7b73-476d-497d-a5e1-51434f88dce5.png?v=1769041972&width=320)

Spring is the ideal season to bring together loved ones for a beautiful brunch. When it comes to hosting a memorable gathering, every detail counts. The ambiance you create sets the stage for a wonderful experience, from the menu to the flower arrangements and, of course, the impeccable wine service. At Beringer, we believe in enhancing every moment with our Private Reserve collection. We have teamed up with [Emily Cooper Cooks](https://www.emilycoopercooks.com/ "Emily Cooper Cooks") to bring you Beringer's guide to hosting brunch.

## Table Setting and Ambiance

Setting the scene for your brunch is essential in creating a warm and inviting atmosphere for your guests. Get personal by putting thought into your seating arrangement and consider ordering pretty paper for individual handwritten place cards. When it comes to seating, aim to foster fun and lively conversations by avoiding seating couples’ side by side and instead placing them across the table. For a new group or a mix of familiar and newer friends, seat guests with common interests nearby to spark potential new friendships. Ensure that all areas where guests will be are tidy and ready for an enjoyable time, with scented candles, coasters, napkins, and ample seating. Set your table ahead of time and choose your serving vessels, labeling them for extra organization. Additionally, provide beverage options for teetotalers and little ones, such as sparkling water and lemonade, and curate a fresh and fun music playlist to play throughout your home.

## Flower Arrangements

Spring is the perfect time to add some seasonal blooms to your brunch table. Tulips, peonies, lilacs, poppies, daffodils, ranunculus, and many more flowers are at their best during this season, so they are ideal choices for your floral arrangements. Choose complementary colors of flowers and use small vases to spread the seasonal blooms around your tablescape and home for a cohesive look. If you have a garden, you can use snipped herbs like lavender and rosemary for beautiful arrangements. You can also add flowering branches with baby flower buds to create stunning statement arrangements.

## Wine Service

Elevate your brunch with impeccable wine service tailored to the characteristics of each wine. Ensure that you have the right glassware for both red and white wine at each place setting. Our Private Reserve Chardonnay, renowned for its full body and complexity on the palate, is best served lightly chilled to accentuate its exceptional qualities. On the other hand, while Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon may be associated with a dark pantry and long aging process, newer vintages can be equally delightful when given some time to bloom at room temperature in a decanter before serving.

## Pairing and Menu Suggestions

When planning your brunch menu, consider incorporating dishes that complement the flavors of our Beringer Private Reserve collection. For instance, Dutch baby pancakes, with their versatile nature, perfectly complement the balanced white wine characteristics of our Private Reserve Chardonnay. The whipped mascarpone, citrus touches, and warm cardamom in the batter harmonize with the wine's acidity, vanilla, and ginger notes. Additionally, chardonnay pairs exquisitely with creamy, buttery sauces, fresh seafood, roasted chicken, and fresh spring vegetables, offering a myriad of options for a delectable spread. As for our Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, it beckons robust and flavorful pairings, such as juicy red meat, fresh rosemary, cracked black peppercorn, and aged cheeses like gorgonzola. Embrace complementary aromatics and classic dishes to create an exceptional pairing experience for your guests.

## Gift Ideas

As a gracious guest, never arrive empty-handed at a gathering. Show your appreciation to your host with thoughtful gifts that reflect their interests and the effort they've put into hosting. Consider gifting gourmands with a nice bottle of olive oil or a fancy box of flaky sea salt. For the consummate host, a set of linen napkins, a fresh bouquet of flowers, or pretty hand soap are thoughtful choices. Another unique idea is to gift your host a fresh bag of coffee beans and local or homemade granola, providing them with a kind gesture for the next morning as they clean up and unwind.

For these brunch recipes, we partnered with Emily Cooper, a classically trained cook, recipe developer, and wine lover based in Oakland. With years of experience in restaurants and culinary strategy for brands like Good Eggs and Momofuku, she loves creating delicious seasonal recipes from her California kitchen to enjoy with her favorite bottles. You can find more of her work at [emilycoopercooks.com](https://www.emilycoopercooks.com/ "Emily Cooper Cooks") or on Instagram [@emilycoopercooks](https://www.instagram.com/emilycoopercooks/ "Emily Cooper Cooks").
