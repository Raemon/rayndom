The Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is a time for family, friends, and heartfelt reunions. This limited-edition red wine celebrates this festive time and its traditions, welcoming the year of the Horse. Toast to both auspicious new beginnings and progress toward goals with this vibrant Cabernet Sauvignon that makes a perfect gift for loved ones or a splendid addition to your collection.  
  
In the Chinese zodiac, the Horse is celebrated for its vitality and dynamic nature. Beringer’s 2023 Year of the Horse Cabernet Sauvignon expresses this equine spirit in its bright and energetic character. Fresh herbes de Provence scents of thyme, tarragon, marjoram, and lavender fill the nose, trailed by red licorice and nutmeg spice notes. Sturdy tannins bridle the expansive palate, where raspberry, pomegranate, and cacao bean flavors gain momentum and strength for a long, bright, red fruit finish. Enjoy this Lunar New Year celebratory wine with pork dumplings, garlic noodles, and wood-fired pizza arrabbiata.

#### Technical info

Alcohol 14.5%

Varietal Cabernet Sauvignon

Blend 92% Cabernet Sauvignon; 8% Merlot

Appellation Napa Valley

Oak treatment 21 Months in French Oak (83% New)

#### Winemaking

Beringer’s Napa Valley vineyards offer Cabernet Sauvignon of such quality that a minimalist approach to winemaking best preserves the integrity of each site’s terroir expression. Each parcel is vinified separately and carefully handled from the moment the fruit comes into the winery at harvest. Tailored pump-over techniques are used for optimal extraction, and the wine is aged in select barrels before blending. This 2023 Lunar New Year Cabernet Sauvignon aged for 21 months in 100% French oak barrels (83% new).

####  Vintage 

Mild weather throughout the 2023 growing season allowed grapes to mature slowly and steadily. This resulted in an unprecedented late harvest, spanning from mid-September to the beginning of November, with the simultaneous ripening of Chardonnay and Cabernet grapes. This convergence led to bustling days in the winery, but our dedicated cellar team, with the support of our harvest interns, played a crucial role in overcoming the challenges. Ultimately, the mild weather contributed to the production of exceptionally fresh wines characterized by excellent acidities, vibrant colors, and ideal tannins.

####  Vineyards 

For the Year of the Horse Cabernet Sauvignon, fruit was selected from Beringer’s Steinhauer and Bancroft Ranch Vineyards on Howell Mountain and Chabot Vineyard in St. Helena. The Howell Mountain vineyards extend above the fog line and benefit from a prolonged growing season. Their vines produce small berries with powerful, concentrated fruit flavors and thick skins that yield robust tannins. Chabot Vineyard lies just north of the road that leads up Howell Mountain. Its inky, highly structured, deeply flavored Cabernet was the first that Beringer Vineyards elected to bottle as a Private Reserve in 1977, and it continues to be a frequent component of contemporary Private Reserve vintages.
