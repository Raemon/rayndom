This beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon from Beringer’s home estate vineyards is full of ripe red berry fruit on the fragrant and aromatic nose. On the palate, layered flavors of black cherry, blackberry, and red currant come through with earthier notes of black truffle, cedar, and vanilla. Full-bodied with rich, round, savory tannins, finishing with generous concentration and energy all the way through the lengthy, mouthwatering finish.

> "Attractive aromas of blackberries and black cherries with some bark and black truffle. Full-bodied and layered with round and rich tannins, yet there’s a firmness and energy at the end. Solid and toned. Serious St. Helena character. Try after 2026." - JamesSuckling.com

####  Vintage 

Abundant late winter rains gave the soils much-needed moisture to kick off the 2019 growing season. The long, warm summer saw few extreme heat events and the typical foggy mornings set the stage for producing vibrant and expressive wines. The long and relatively mild finish to the season helped to preserve freshness and finesse in the fruit, with extended hangtime producing great color, flavor, structure, and tannin. Overall, the season was marked by exceptional fruit development with bright acidity, producing an outstanding vintage.

####  Vineyards 

The St. Helena Home Vineyard is largely responsible for the establishment of Beringer Vineyards because this site, situated around the present-day winery, first attracted founder Jacob Beringer to the property in 1875. The vineyard is formed on a sloped alluvial fan of rock and gravelly soils with little capacity to hold water. Planted exclusively to Cabernet Sauvignon, its fruit has been a component of the Private Reserve Cabernet since 1982. St. Helena Home Vineyard Cabernet is characterized by classic Cabernet flavors of berries and black cherries, layered with licorice and spice and a fleshy mid-palate. The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon aged 21 months in French oak barrels. Careful attention is paid to vineyard blocks, which are kept separate and vinified with the goal of extracting maximum flavor.
