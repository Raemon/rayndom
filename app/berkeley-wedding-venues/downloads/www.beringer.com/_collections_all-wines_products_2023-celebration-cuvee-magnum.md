#### Technical info

Alcohol 14.7%

Blend 88% Cabernet Sauvignon; 11% Malbec; 1% Petit Verdot

Appellation Howell Mountain

Oak treatment 17 Months in French Oak (56% New)

#### Winemaking

This 2023 Celebration Cuvée hails solely from Howell Mountain, and each distinctive lot was kept separate from the moment of harvest until final blending. This special release wine features a foundation of Cabernet Sauvignon, the backbone and undisputed star for Beringer. Malbec and Petit Verdot blend with the Cabernet to contribute a round mouthfeel and soft tannins for immediate enjoyment. The wine was aged in French oak (56% new) for 17 months and allowed to further integrate and gain complexity in magnums before release

####  Vintage 

Mild weather throughout the 2023 growing season allowed grapes to mature slowly and steadily. This resulted in an unprecedented late harvest, spanning from mid-September to the beginning of November, with the simultaneous ripening of Chardonnay and Cabernet grapes. This convergence led to bustling days in the winery, but our dedicated cellar team, with the support of our harvest interns, played a crucial role in overcoming the challenges. Ultimately, the mild weather contributed to the production of exceptionally fresh wines characterized by excellent acidities, vibrant colors, and ideal tannins.

####  Vineyards 

Howell Mountain rises just to the northeast of Beringer's winery in St. Helena. In 1984, it was the first area within the Napa Valley appellation to be declared a separate viticultural area (AVA) for the distinct characteristics of its wine grapes. Howell Mountain vineyards are typically 5 - 10°F cooler than the valley floor but receive more hours of sunshine over the course of a day as they extend above the fog line. This allows for both prolonged hang time and slow, even flavor development during the growing season. The soil here is shallow, infertile and extremely well drained. The vines produce small berries with powerful, concentrated fruit flavors and thick skins that yield robust tannins.
