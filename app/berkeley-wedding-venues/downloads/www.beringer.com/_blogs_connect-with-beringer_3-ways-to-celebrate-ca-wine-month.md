# Celebrate California Wine Month with Beringer

Aug 25, 2025

![Celebrate California Wine Month with Beringer](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/BER_Winery_Rhine_House_copy_1_5a49f47c-4b88-47e0-86b6-6db89e50dd28.jpg?v=1769041891&width=320)

September marks **California Wine Month** , a time to swirl, sip, and savor the craftsmanship that defines our state’s renowned wine regions. From sun-ripened fruit on the vine to the nuanced aromas developed in the cellar, California wines offer a spectrum of styles worth exploring. This month, we invite you to raise a glass to the vineyards, vintners, and varietals that make our home truly world-class. Here are three ways to celebrate with Beringer.

## Expand Your Palate

We all have our favorites when it comes to wine. Perhaps you’re partial to buttery chardonnays or are a cabernet sauvignon fan. While part of enjoying wine is about finding what varietals and styles make your palate sing, there is something to be said for trying new things. To celebrate wine month, seek out a wine that is totally out of your wheelhouse. If you’re here in Napa, our wine educators would love to help you pick something interesting from our cellar. If you’re elsewhere, head to your local wine store and have a conversation with the staff about what out-of-the-box California wine they recommend. Who knows, you might find a new favorite. To take it a step further, see if you can find a wine class in your area. Many wine stores or community colleges will host workshops or seminars for all levels of oenophiles.

## Host a Blind Tasting

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/7266/9353/files/BER_2018_KV_CabS_CloseUp_Beauty_Horiz_0463.jpg?v=1755212122)

Grab your friends and family and host a blind tasting. Why blind you might ask? Not being able to see the label or varietal forces you to rely on your senses and be more in tune with what’s happening on your palate. We’re such big fans of blind tastings that we made our own guide to help you host an expert event. Check it out [**here.**](https://www.beringer.com/blogs/connect-with-beringer/host-an-evening-of-blind-tastings-with-cabernets-best-kept-secret) If you’d rather take it your own direction, just choose a theme, get some brown paper bags to hide the bottles, make sure everyone has a pen and paper to take notes and you’re off!

## Visit us in Saint Helena![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/7266/9353/files/BER_Lifestyle_TastingRoom_Nov2015.jpg?v=1755212554)

We’re biased, but we think one of the very best ways to celebrate California Wine Month is to visit Napa, California’s premier winegrowing region, and join us here at Beringer. September is an exciting time in the Napa Valley as it marks the start of harvest—you’ll see activity in the vineyards and catch the scent of fresh crush in the air. The warm summer weather lingers through the month, making it the perfect time to stroll our historic grounds, explore the iconic Rhine House, and enjoy a guided tasting of our wines. This month also brings the release of our latest Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon vintage, making a visit the ideal way to experience one of Napa Valley’s most acclaimed wines at its debut. Purchase your tickets[**here**](https://www.beringer.com/pages/winery-events)and be part of the celebration.
