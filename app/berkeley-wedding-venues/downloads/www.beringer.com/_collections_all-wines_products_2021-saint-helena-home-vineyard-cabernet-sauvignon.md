The St. Helena Home Vineyard Cabernet has a dark ruby cast and intrigues the nose with scents of bramble berries, black cherry, fig, and a whisper of spearmint. Its fragrant medley of fruit aromas is complemented by barrel notes of sandalwood, baking spice, and rum-raisin cake. Plum and currant compose the predominant flavor chord on the palate, and fine tannins give the mouthfeel a full-bodied intensity and grace. Mulled fruit and toasted vanilla flavor notes echo through the lingering finish. Enjoy now, with decant, or over the next 15 years.

> “The 2021 Beringer ‘Ste. Helena Home Vineyard’ Cabernet Sauvignon comes from a slightly warmer site that is at the winery and across the street from the winery. This has fennel and black raspberry notes on the palate, with terrific finesse and great damp soil character. Lifted and bright with loads of tension and mouth-watering acidity, enjoy now and over the next fifteen years. Drink 2025-2040.”

#### Technical info

Alcohol 15.1%

Varietal Cabernet Sauvignon

Blend 100% Cabernet Sauvignon

Oak treatment 22 months in 100% French oak (93% new)

#### Winemaking

The Beringer reserve vineyards offer Cabernet Sauvignon of such quality that a minimalist approach to winemaking has long defined this special blend. Each parcel is vinified separately and monitored carefully from the moment the fruit comes into the winery at harvest. Tailored pump-over techniques are used for optimal extraction, and the wine is aged in hand-selected, custom-toasted barrels of French oak. This 2021 St. Helena Home Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon aged for 22 months in French oak barrels (93% new).

####  Vintage 

The 2021 growing season started early, with extended periods of sunny weather and late, but much-needed rain. Because of low humidity, high heat, and high winds that began in early May, it was expected to be a drought year. However, it turned more seasonal, with normal temperatures in the summer. Even ripening and lower yields led to one of the earliest harvest starts with the grapes showing intense fruit flavor development. Once harvest began, we saw clear skies through September and well into October before some early rain.

####  Vineyards 

The St. Helena Home Vineyard is largely responsible for the establishment of Beringer Vineyards because this site, situated around the present-day winery, first attracted founder Jacob Beringer to the property in 1875. The vineyard is formed on a sloped alluvial fan of rock and gravelly soils with little capacity to hold water. Planted exclusively to Cabernet Sauvignon, its fruit has been a component of the Private Reserve Cabernet since 1982. St. Helena Home Vineyard Cabernet is characterized by classic Cabernet flavors of berries and black cherries, layered with licorice and spice and a fleshy mid-palate.
