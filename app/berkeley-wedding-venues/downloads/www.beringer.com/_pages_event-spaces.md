####  Wine Caves 

The Beringer Brothers built the Old Winery against a hillside, so they could use gravity flow methods to make the wine, as was the custom in their native Rhine Valley. Construction of the winery began in 1876 and it became operational for the harvest of 1877. Draft horses would bring wagons of grapes up the road behind the winery to the third floor. Grapes were crushed in the then state-of-the-art steam-powered crusher. The freshly pressed juice was gravity fed down to the second floor for fermentation, then flowed by gravity again to the ground floor where it was stored and aged before being bottled.

Rare among Napa Valley wineries, the aging tunnels of Beringer were dug into the hillside of Spring Mountain from the late 1870s to the early 1880s. Both the Old Winery and the historic tunnels provide a perfect location for a pre-dinner reception or daytime winery tour.
