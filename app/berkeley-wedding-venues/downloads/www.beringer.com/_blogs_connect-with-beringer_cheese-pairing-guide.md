# Cheese Pairing Guide

Jun 17, 2025

![Beringer Vineyards Cheese Pairing Guide](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/1000x650_BER.png?v=1749772437&width=320)

## _A guide to preparing a memorable cheese platter that pairs beautifully with Beringer wines._

Nothing is more elegant, simple, and delicious than a slice of cheese paired with a complementing wine. Elevate your next dinner party by wowing your guests with an extravagant cheese pairing. In this guide, you will find four unique wine and cheese pairings, the best temperatures to store and serve each pairing, and tips on how to create a memorable presentation.

## Four Superb Pairings

### 2020 Winery Exclusive Carneros Chardonnay + Triple Cream Brie

This Winery Exclusive Chardonnay bears a clean and energetic style that makes it both refreshing and satisfying. Producing aromatics evoking meyer lemon and white peach with a subtle hint of vanilla. On the palate, lively acidity supports flavors of golden delicious apple and anjou pear through to a long satisfying finish. Our riper, more fruit-forward, balanced-oak chardonnay makes a wonderful match with a rich, buttery triple cream brie with a salty rind.

### 2020 Winery Exclusive Napa Valley Pinot Noir + Firm Alpine Style such as Gruyere

Medium bodied, fruit-forward with notes of black cherry and clove, the 2020 Winery Exclusive Pinot Noir pairs nicely with the big, brawny cheeses of the French, Swiss, and Italian Alps. They offer large, rugged, low-moisture, and low-salt to create nutty, savory Alpine cheeses we love.

### 2018 Home Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon + Aged Gouda

The 2018 Home Vineyard Cabernet offers bright red fruit, blood orange, spice, and warm vanilla. Aged gouda is our favorite pairing for the rich, classic berry flavors of our Cabernet Sauvignon. The firmer texture of the gouda and subtle nutty flavors complement the structure and finish of the cabernet rather than overpowering it.

### 2016 Nightingale Dessert Wine + Blue Cheese

Our 2016 Nightingale Botrytised Semillon / Sauvignon Blanc offers preserved Meyer lemon, burnt caramel, and honey on the palate, with further aromas and flavors of apricot and touches of spice. Roquefort is a sheep milk cheese from Southern France and is one of the world's best-known blue cheeses. The sweet flavors of our Nightingale are excellent with the complex flavors of the Roquefort, creating a salty-sweet combination and will serve well as a spectacular final course.

## Storing Cheese

Until about an hour before you're ready to serve, cheese should be kept cold and stored in the refrigerator in a dark, cool and airy space.

## Cutting Cheese

You will want to use a good hard cheese knife- like a chef's knife, a skeleton knife, or a utility knife. Slice hard wedge cheeses in batons, rectangles, or triangles. For aged cheeses like parmesan and gouda, break them off into rustic chunks. For soft round cheeses, work from the center of the wheel, and cut bite-sized slices like you would cut a birthday cake. For a gooey soft cheese, score the top, peel it back, and serve.

## Serving Cheese

Once all of your cheese has been cut, sliced, or chunked, you are ready to serve. You may serve your cheese pairings individually with each wine or create a cheese tasting board.
