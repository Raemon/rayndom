In the glass, a raspberry rim deepens into dark boysenberry purple hues, the 2020 Celebration Cuvée is an alluring and expressive wine worthy of all celebrations. On the nose, aromas of mulberry, blackberry, blueberry skin, and cordial come forward with hints of leather, cinnamon sticks, and tar. Bright plum notes on the entrance introduce a balanced mouthfeel of fine-grain tannin supporting the taste of spiced walnuts, dark cherry preserve, and spice cake which leads to a lingering finish of woody spice. Bright pomegranate acidity rounds out the profile creating a cornucopia of dark fruit and spice flavors. Great with salty foods, or by itself, the Celebration Cuvée is ready to drink now or can be cellared for up to 10 years.

#### Technical info

Alcohol 14.6%

Varietal Red Wine

Blend Cabernet Sauvignon & Merlot

Oak treatment Aged 18 months in French oak

#### Winemaking

Hand-selected lots of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot showed bright and soft, supported with oak and spice notes. The red wines were carefully extracted to ensure the right balance of tannin and acidity. The oak selected for this wine expressed notes of cinnamon and baking spice. The wine aged 18 months in French oak (50% new) allowing the oak character to be wholly integrated. The Cabernet and Merlot are blended early to ensure by bottling time this blend is ready to enjoy immediately upon release.

####  Vintage 

The 2020 grape harvest will be remembered for factors beyond the typical growing season. The vintage commenced with a warm, dry winter, with cooler weather arriving in late March. While the mild spring season was a great start, our winery work was stymied by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Summer brought cool mornings and warm days, but autumnal California wildfires arrived as grape picking began. We were fortunate our vineyards were not in active fire areas. While the red wine harvest provided a smaller yield and proved to be one of the most challenging in history, our winemakers remained optimistic and very complimentary of the high quality achieved from this unprecedented vintage. Overall, the season was marked by exceptional fruit development with phenolic ripeness, producing a wonderful wine vintage. The beautiful red wines our winemakers were able to produce from the complex 2020 vintage are worth celebrating.
