This Chardonnay opens with lovely, perfumed aromas of bright citrus, including lemon zest and a touch of orange and tangerine marmalade — enlivened by a delicate white flower musk. Subtle hints of white tea, white chocolate and honeycomb add warmth and complexity. The palate is mouthwatering and fresh, showing vibrant acidity balanced by a full-bodied weight and a round, rich character. The flavor evolves beautifully, showcasing layers of Asian pear, lemon meringue and sweet pineapple. Spiced undertones interlace with the fruit, adding notes of jasmine, hazelnut and vanilla, all creating a nuanced depth. The finish is unctuous, highlighting beeswax, fresh hay, and lanolin, with a pleasing viscosity that coats the mouth rounding out this expressive and elegant Chardonnay.

> "Aromas of lemon confit, yellow apples, baking spices and grilled pineapple. The palate is full-bodied with a creamy texture and bright acidity, giving flavors of grapefruit, lanolin, apple tart and honeysuckle. Quite a powerful wine that is carried by pure acidity and freshness."

> “A bigger, richer expression of the variety, the 2023 Chardonnay Private Reserve comes mostly from the Gamble vineyard in Oakville and spent nine months in 68% new French oak. It offers ripe stone fruits, orange blossom, spice, and honeyed white flowers. Medium to full-bodied, it's pure, balanced, and layered, with wonderfully integrated oak. It brings ample power and richness while staying light on its feet. Drink 2025-2032.”

#### Technical info

Alcohol 14.9%

Varietal Chardonnay

Blend 100% Chardonnay

Oak treatment 8 months in (50% new) French Oak

#### Winemaking

Each Chardonnay lot is kept separate throughout the aging process for this flagship wine. After sending the fruit directly to press, the juice is fermented in 100% French oak barrels (50% new) for 8 months to enhance the natural richness in the wine. The lees were stirred every other month to integrate the subtle oak notes and helped to develop a lovely texture, body, and mouthfeel. After aging, the most expressive lots are chosen, then blended to create a richly layered wine with aromatic aromas and rich fruit flavor intensity.

####  Vintage 

The 2023 harvest proved to be another unusual one, with a mild growing season allowing the vines to progress at a leisurely pace. The slow and steady ripening resulted in an unprecedented late harvest, spanning from mid-September to the beginning of November. Adding to the uniqueness was the simultaneous ripening of Chardonnay and Cabernet grapes. This convergence led to bustling days in the winery, but our dedicated cellar team, with the support of our harvest interns, played a crucial role in overcoming the challenges. Their commitment and hard work contributed significantly to ensuring the success of this exceptional vintage. Despite the challenges posed by the late and compressed harvest season, the mild weather contributed to the production of exceptionally fresh wines. These wines are characterized by excellent acidities, vibrant colors, and ideal tannins. Grapes for this 2023 Private Reserve were picked between October 8 to November 1, 2023.

####  Vineyards 

Gamble Ranch is Beringer’s northernmost Chardonnay vineyard and has been the primary source for Private Reserve for decades. Located near the town of Yountville, in the Oakville AVA, daytime temperatures here slowly climb as the cooling morning fog recedes south to San Pablo Bay. This significant diurnal shift allows the grapes to maintain their acidity, which is essential to balancing the ripe, rich flavors as they develop during warm afternoons. Older vines, planted in 1976, featuring the Wente Clone 4, are predominant. For 2023, close to 18% of the blend was crafted from Big Ranch vineyard in Oak Knoll, which imparts a cooling influence being more centrally located within Napa Valley. Here the fruit retains more acidity and minerality, an influence from being closer to the San Pablo Bay. A higher selection of Burgundy clones also provides an elegant complexity and weight.
