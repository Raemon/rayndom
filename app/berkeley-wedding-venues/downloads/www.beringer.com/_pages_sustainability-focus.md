##  Generations of sustainability 

## 

At Beringer, we’ve always known that part of making great wines is caring for the land, animals, and people that make those wines possible. That’s why we’ve had sustainable farming and practices in place from the start.

﻿All of our owned and leased [vineyards](https://www.beringer.com/en/best-vineyards-in-napa.html) are certified sustainable by third parties, and we provide our external growers with the resources they need to achieve sustainable farming practices.

For over a century & a half 

##  Beringer has been a pioneer of sustainability 

From innovating gravity-fed systems in the 1800s to cutting-edge energy and efficiency technology in the following century, Beringer Vineyards is one of the most technologically advanced wineries in the world, allowing us to produce wine with minimum intervention and impact on the natural environment.

#### RENEWABLE ENERGY

As a first step in our Net Zero journey, we have committed to powering our operations with 100% renewable electricity by the end of 2024. Currently, rooftop solar generates more than 40% of our electricity needs on site, and we are expanding our arrays so that, upon completion, we will generate over 60% of our electricity needs with on-site solar power.

#### WATER CONSERVATION

Water is one of our most precious resources, and we aim to use it as efficiently as possible. To minimize the amount of water we extract from our wells, we capture rainwater for reuse in our winery. Beringer is also one of the largest contributors to Napa River Restoration, ensuring the health of our local waterways.

#### PACKAGING & WASTE

We reduce our impact on landfills and the environment by considering reduction, reuse, and recyclability throughout the product and packaging lifecycle. We also manage and reduce waste through comprehensive composting and takeback programs.

##  Sustainability Certifications 

Beringer maintains sustainability certifications across 100% of our owned and leased operations, and actively encourages other grape growers we partner with to do the same.
