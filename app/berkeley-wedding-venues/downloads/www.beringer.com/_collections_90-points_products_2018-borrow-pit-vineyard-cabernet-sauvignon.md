A fabulous expression of Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine draws you in with aromas of dark, ripe fruit and oak spice. On the palate, lush flavors of plum and currant rest alongside hints of mocha and dried blueberry. Robust, plush tannins support these bold flavors and give way to a long, persistent finish.

> Ripe-blackberry, cooked black-cherry, roasted-coffee, dried-earth and chocolate aromas. It’s medium-to full-bodied with firm, polished tannins. Round and caressing with a velvety, chocolatey finish.

####  Vintage 

An exceptional vintage, the 2018 season started with a cool spring that delayed flowering but fruit set was fine and even. With few exceptions, Summer was moderate, sunny and dry without major heat spikes. The fine weather continued on through the Fall, allowing Cabernet Sauvignon to hang longer on the vine to develop flavors and achieve phenolic ripeness without additional sugar accumulation, resulting in beautiful structure, intense color, concentration of fruit and excellent balance in the wines.

####  Vineyards 

Located near the town of Yountville, Borrow Pit is nestled in the Oakville AVA, and sees daytime temperatures slowly climb as the cooling morning fog recedes south to San Pablo Bay. This significant diurnal shift allows the grapes to maintain their acidity, which is essential to balancing the ripe, rich flavors that develop during hot afternoons. The site’s topsoil was used in the construction of Rector Dam in 1946, and the remaining ground subsoil is Perkins Gravelly Loam, with excellent drainage well suited for Cabernet Sauvignon. In 2015 an array of six different clone and root stock combinations was planted here. Vines struggle to produce clusters of small grapes, with high skin-to-juice ratios and concentrated flavors that give this wine much sought-after intensity, complexity, and depth.
