Beautifully full-bodied and rich, with saturated, deep color and depth, the 2019 vintage of Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon is a powerhouse with unctuous dark berry fruit. On the nose and palate, plush, ripe berry notes of blackberry, blackcurrant, boysenberry and black cherry interweave seamlessly alongside delicate floral notes, creating a mouthwatering profile that is pleasing and multi-layered. Hints of wild violets, cocoa powder, and graphite, dance on the tongue, while warmed spice notes, from the well-integrated oak, support the ripe, refined, velvety-textured tannins, leading to a focused, firm structure with a core of fresh acidity, and a long, persistent, well-integrated finish. Drinking beautifully upon release and will continue to blossom after years of carful cellaring.

> “The flagship 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Private Reserve comes from a mix of the single vineyards and is raised in 90% new French oak. Proof that sometimes the sum is greater than the individual components, this beautifully balanced, seamless Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon offers classic cassis and dark fruits as well as tobacco leaf, lead pencil, charcoal, and licorice. An incredibly compelling, full-bodied beauty, it has plenty of ripe, mouthcoating tannins, a great mid-palate, and terrific purity of fruit. It can be drunk anytime over the coming 20-25 years.”

> “Beringer's 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Private Reserve is greater than the sum of (most of) its parts. Lovely floral and cassis shadings combine with the merest whisper of green herbs, just enough to keep things interesting and varietally distinct. It's medium to full-bodied and strongly tannic, so it needs time in the cellar, maybe even more so than the individual components.” 

Joe Czerwinski, Wine Advocate, June 2022

#### Winemaking

The Beringer reserve vineyards offer Cabernet Sauvignon of such high quality that a minimalist approach to winemaking has long defined this special blend. Each vineyard is vinified separately and monitored carefully from the moment the fruit comes into the winery at Harvest. Tailored pump-over techniques are used for optimal extraction, and the wine is aged in hand-selected, custom-toasted barrels of new French oak (64% new). Each lot was aged for 18 months before selection of the final blend, to allow each vineyard to express the depth of its unique terroir.

####  Vintage 

Abundant late winter rains gave the soils much needed moisture to kick off the 2019 growing season. The long, warm summer saw few extreme heat events and the typical foggy mornings set the stage for producing vibrant and expressive wines. The long and relatively mild finish to the season helped to preserve freshness and finesse in the fruit with extended hangtime producing great color, flavor, structure, and tannin. Overall, the season was marked by exceptional fruit development with bright acidity, producing an outstanding vintage.

####  Vineyards 

Steinhauer Ranch (65%) atop Howell Mountain provides the foundation for the 2019 blend while fruit from Oakville’s Gamble Ranch Vineyard (21%) supported the overall blend. Fruit from the St. Helena Home Vineyard (25%) added the warmth of the St. Helena appellation while exceptional fruit from Spring Mountain’s Marston Vineyard (4%) joins contributions from Mount Veeder’s Lampyridae Vineyard (3%). As with previous vintages of Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, each vineyard lot is closely watched during the ripening period to determine the ideal pick time. Grapes for the 2019 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon were harvested between October 3 – 30th.
