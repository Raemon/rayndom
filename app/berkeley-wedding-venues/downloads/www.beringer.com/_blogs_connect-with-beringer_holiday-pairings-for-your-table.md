# Holiday Pairings for Your Table

Dec 2, 2025

![Holiday Pairings for Your Table](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/1000X650_BER_Private_Reserve_Holiday_Table_45018393-f1fa-478a-a03a-d78a606fe503.png?v=1765225230&width=320)

At Beringer, the holidays celebrate the best of food and wine. It’s a time to break out old family recipes, get adventurous with new flavors and indulge in holiday classics all at the same time. In our humble opinion, every dish on your holiday table deserves a wine pairing that enhances its flavors and enjoyment.

![Smoked Salmon Crostini Private Reserve Chardonnay](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/7266/9353/files/1000X650_BER_Salmon.jpg?v=1750053534)

## Smoked Salmon Crostini & [Private Reserve Chardonnay](https://www.beringer.com/products/2023-private-reserve-chardonnay)

The richness of the chardonnay beautifully complements the buttery texture and subtle smokiness of the salmon. The creamy notes and hints of oak in the wine harmonize exquisitely with the velvety texture of the salmon. The wine's balanced acidity also cuts through the richness of the salmon, enhancing its flavors without overpowering the delicate taste.

![Bacon-Wrapped Dates Stuffed with Blue Cheese](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/7266/9353/files/1000X650_BER_Dates.jpg?v=1750053534)

## Bacon-Wrapped Dates Stuffed with Blue Cheese & [Winery Exclusive Knights Valley Red Blend](https://www.beringer.com/products/2022-knights-valley-red-blend)

Our Knights Valley Blend has dark berry notes, hints of spice and a velvety texture that complements the savory-sweet combination of the bacon-wrapped dates. The wine's dark fruit character enhances the sweetness of the dates, while its nuanced spice notes harmonize with the smoky richness of the bacon. The creamy and tangy blue cheese filling adds depth and complexity to the dish, creating a perfect balance of flavors.

![Roasted Garlic and Rosemary Lamp Chops](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/7266/9353/files/1000X650_BER_Lamb.jpg?v=1750053534)

## Roasted Garlic and Rosemary Lamp Chops & [Knights Valley Cabernet Sauvignon](https://www.beringer.com/products/2022-knights-valley-cabernet-sauvignon)

With rich dark fruit notes, hints of spice, and firm tannins, the wine creates a perfect pairing with the tender, succulent lamb. The robustness of the cabernet sauvignon stands up to the bold flavors of the dish, enhancing the overall sensory experience. The earthy undertones in both the wine and the roasted lamb accentuate each other, while the wine's tannins help cleanse the palate after each savory bite.

![Roasted Duck Breast with Cherry Port Wine Sauce](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0680/7266/9353/files/1000X650_BER_Duck.jpg?v=1750053534)

## Roasted Duck Breast with Cherry Port Wine Sauce & [Steinhauer Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon](https://www.beringer.com/products/ber-steinhauer-rch-nv-cabs-22)

The succulent and rich flavors of the duck breast, with its crispy skin and tender meat, complement the complexity of the cabernet sauvignon beautifully. The wine's dark fruit notes and hints of spices enhance the savory aspects of the duck, while its velvety texture complements the luxurious mouthfeel of the dish. The cherry port wine sauce adds a touch of sweetness and tanginess that elevates the flavors of both the duck and the wine, creating a harmonious balance on the palate.
