> A bolder, dark-fruited and more powerful expression of Howell Mountain that carries a deeper line weight of tannins. Aromas are tinged with dark-roasted herbs, wet concrete-like savory notes, graphite, cassis and currants, leading to a palate with distinctively powerful tannins that are precisely groomed. Impressive depth and freshness. Try from 2021.

####  Vintage 

The 2015 growing season was marked by pleasant weather with little pressure from heat spikes or unseasonable rain. A dry winter, common in recent years, was quickly followed by an equally dry spring, leading to an early bud break and fast start to the growing season. Warm weather continued throughout late spring and summer, allowing for the steady and sure development of flavors. The overall quality, complexity and balance in the vines produced exceptional fruit for winemakers. The impact of the continuing drought was evident in slightly lighter crop loads, but the reduction in size was offset by an increase in quality.

####  Vineyards 

Originally known as Tre Colline for its memorable undulating terrain, the 36-acre benchland vineyard was renamed in 2003 to honor Beringer’s long-time vineyard manager, Bob Steinhauer, who helped establish the reserve level vineyards across Napa Valley. At 1,800 feet elevation, southwest facing on Howell Mountain, just northeast of Angwin, Steinhauer Ranch features volcanic iron-rich soils notable for their rich red color, with a friable, loose texture. Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc thrive in the sparse, infertile soil where cool mountain temperatures with high solar radiation above the fog line allow grapes to languish on the vine, developing bold tannins and distinctive notes.
