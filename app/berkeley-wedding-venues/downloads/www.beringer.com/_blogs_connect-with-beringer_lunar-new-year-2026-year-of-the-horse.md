# Welcoming Year of the Fire Horse

Jan 12, 2026

![Welcoming Year of the Fire Horse](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/BER_2023_LNY_YoH_Perpendicular_Right_Duo_Lifestyle_Image.jpg?v=1768513656&width=320)

Tuesday, February 17, 2026 welcomes the Year of the Horse, specifically the Fire Horse, a symbol of vitality, momentum, and confident forward motion.

At Beringer, Napa Valley’s longest continuously operating winery, we honor this energetic zodiac year with craftsmanship, heritage, and hospitality that has defined us since 1876.

* * *

## Why the Year of the Horse Matters

In the Chinese zodiac cycle, the Horse is the seventh animal, celebrated for speed, independence, and exuberant energy. The Fire element adds warmth and drive. The Fire Horse year runs Feb 17, 2026 to Feb 5, 2027.

Traditional festivities include red decor, family reunions, and feasts. Many households exchange red envelopes (hongbao) to convey luck and goodwill. The red color symbolizes happiness and prosperity, and the practice has roots in legends about protecting children and ushering in fortune.

* * *

## A Limited Napa Tradition: Lunar New Year Cabernet Sauvignon

Our latest release, the [2023 Year of the Horse Cuvée](https://www.beringer.com/products/2023-year-of-the-horse-cabernet-sauvignon) is now available along with a bundle of all the past Lunar New Year wines, featuring the Dragon, Snake, and Horse releases. Available for a limited time.****

## Red Envelopes, Symbols and Good Fortune

  * Hongbao (Red envelopes): gift of money in red paper to convey luck and protection. Even numbers are favored, especially 6 and 8.
  * Red and Gold décor: red wards off misfortune, gold denotes prosperity. Perfect for your table setting and bottle accents.

## Festive Food Pairings with Beringer Wines

Lunar New Year menus favor symbolic dishes, each with a meaning and an ideal wine style. Below are sommelier-informed, kitchen-friendly pairings to harmonize complexity (sweet, sour, umami, spice) with balance and brightness.

### 1) Whole Steamed or Braised Fish (年年有余: “surplus every year”)

Why it’s served: “Fish” (_yú_) sounds like “surplus,” symbolizing abundance.  
Pairing: German Riesling (Kabinett/Spätlese) for high acidity and gentle sweetness. A low tannin Gamay/Beaujolais can also work with red braised styles.  
Beringer Upgrade: [Luminus Chardonnay (Napa Valley)](https://www.beringer.com/collections/chardonnay/products/2024-luminus-chardonnay) for freshness and texture.

### 2) Dumplings (金元宝: “gold ingots” for wealth)

Why it’s served: Ingots shape equals prosperity. Families wrap and eat together.  
Pairing: Sparkling wine or Pinot Noir to cut richness and match savory fillings.  
Beringer Upgrade: [Knights Valley Mountain Rosé](https://www.beringer.com/products/2024-knights-valley-mountain-rose) or [Alluvium Blanc](https://www.beringer.com/products/2024-knights-valley-alluvium-blanc) for bright, palate-cleansing lift.

### 3) Longevity Noodles (长寿面)

Why it’s served: Uncut length represents a long life.  
Pairing: Off-dry Riesling or light, chilled Cabernet Franc blend.  
Beringer Option: [Knights Valley Cabernet Sauvignon](https://www.beringer.com/products/2022-knights-valley-cabernet-sauvignon) lightly chilled (55–58°F) if sauce leans savory and mild.

### 4) Spring Rolls and Crispy Dishes (金条: “gold bars”)

Why it’s served: Golden, bar-like shape symbolizes wealth.  
Pairing: Sparkling wine (brut) or vibrant Chardonnay.  
Beringer Upgrade: [Private Reserve Chardonnay](https://www.beringer.com/products/2023-private-reserve-chardonnay) for a celebratory, layered pairing.

### 5) Sweet Rice Dumplings (汤圆)

Why it’s served: Roundness signifies reunion.  
Pairing: Late-harvest or demi-sec sparkling.  
Beringer Option: Serve a small glass of Nightingale (classic Beringer Sauterne-style) if available.

> Expert tip: Sommeliers advise prioritizing high acidity, lower alcohol, modest oak, and slight sweetness for multi-dish Chinese feasts. This avoids pairing conflicts when many flavors share the table.
