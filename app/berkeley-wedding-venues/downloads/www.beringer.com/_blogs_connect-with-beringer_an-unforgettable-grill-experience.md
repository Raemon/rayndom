# An Unforgettable Grill Experience

Jun 17, 2025

![An Unforgettable Grill Experience](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/PR_GrillingWinePairing.jpg?v=1755639914&width=320)

## 2022 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon and Grilled Ribeye

Recognized for its opulent black fruit flavors accented by nuances of chocolate, tobacco, and cedar, our Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon invites a dance with dishes boasting equivalent boldness. Our choice, Grilled Ribeye Steaks with Red Wine accompanied by Grilled Asparagus with Lemon Zest. It's the epitome of a sunshine grilling season, offering a harmonious balance of robust flavors and refreshing elements. The intensity of the ribeye and the richness of the red wine jus resonates with the complex flavor profile of the Cabernet, while the lemon zest-topped asparagus introduces a lighter, tangy undertone, serving as a delicate counterpoint. The result is a symphony of flavors that embodies the spirit of Private Reserve.

## Grilled Ribeye Steaks with Red Wine

### Ingredients

  * 2 ribeye steaks (about 1.5 inches thick)
  * Salt and freshly ground black pepper
  * 2 tablespoons olive oil
  * 1 shallot, finely chopped 
  * 1 cup red wine
  * 1 cup beef broth
  * 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
  * A few sprigs of fresh thyme



### Instructions

  1. Preheat your grill to high heat.
  2. Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper on both sides.
  3. Place the steaks on the grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or until desired doneness.
  4. Remove the steaks from the grill and let them rest while you prepare the red wine jus.
  5. In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped shallot and sauté until soft and translucent, about 2-3 minutes.
  6. Pour in the wine and beef broth, then add the sprigs of thyme. Let it simmer until reduced by half, about 10-15 minutes.
  7. Remove the thyme sprigs, then whisk in the butter to create a glossy jus. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  8. Slice the rested steaks against the grain and serve with the red wine jus on top.

## Private Reserve

Our Private Reserve represents the pinnacle of the portfolio. Former Chief Winemakers Myron Nightingale and Ed Sbragia created the Private Reserve program in 1977 with the goal of crafting Napa's finest Cabernet Sauvignon. The Private Reserve Chardonnay was introduced with the 1978 vintage, and together these wines have earned three decades of extraordinary accolades, including two "Wine of the Year" awards.
