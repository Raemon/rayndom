Staining the glass with a deep ruby color, the 2020 Mt Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon's colors are derived from thorough extraction during the winemaking process. On the nose, Dark plum and herbaceous sage notes mix with mineral notes of carbon and graphite. Cassis is also apparent with an expresso finish of Moka and leather. The aromas promised on the nose ring true on the palate. The extracted tannin paired with a healthy acidity, create ta beautiful platform for the fruit, herb, and mineral notes to sit atop. Secondary notes of baking spice also appear upon second and third sip. Beautiful now with decant, this wine will age for another 25+ years.

####  Vintage 

The 2020 vintage was marked by a number of challenges. After a warm, dry winter, a mild spring gave the vines a great early start. However, cold weather set in at the end of March, with late spring rains falling during bloom. Summer brought very cool mornings and very warm days with extreme lightning storms. Heat spikes began in mid-to-late August and continued through mid-September. The build-up to harvest was interrupted by two wildfires toward fall. The vintage ended midway through the harvest season, with the fruit for this wine picked from September 29 through October 9.

####  Vineyards 

Lampyridae, “firefly” in Latin, is Napa's highest vineyard at approximately 2,400 feet elevation. This picturesque vineyard is high above the fog layer and has longer hours of sunshine and warmer nights, but days are cooler than the lower elevation vineyards. On clear days you can see all the way to San Francisco. One of the newest vineyards in the Private Reserve line-up, it shows incredible depth of flavor and intense, unique black fruit characters. The 2020 Mount Veeder Lampyridae Vineyard Cabernet aged 21 months in 100% new French oak barrels. Careful attention is paid to vineyard blocks, which are kept separate and vinified with a goal of extracting maximum flavor.
