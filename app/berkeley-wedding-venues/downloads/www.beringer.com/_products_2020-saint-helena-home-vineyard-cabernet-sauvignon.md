Dark ruby to the edge of the glass, the St. Helena Home Vineyard is show-stopper in terms of color. The extracted fruit flavors exude from the glass with lush plums, currant, violets, and a mulled fruit note which churns below the brighter fruit notes. There are notes of oak spice and molasses which round out the aroma bouquet. On the palate, plum is predominant flavor, followed by beautiful violets and a re-emergence of the mulled fruit notes. Baking spice with vanilla are much more apparent and persist through the long finish. The tannin is big, but not overly biting. The big tannins are mollified by the acidity to create a finish which lasts for minutes. Enjoy now, with decant, or over the next 25years.

####  Vintage 

The 2020 vintage was marked by a number of challenges. After a warm, dry winter, a mild spring gave the vines a great early start. However, cold weather set in at the end of March, with late spring rains falling during bloom. Summer brought very cool mornings and very warm days with extreme lightning storms. Heat spikes began in mid-to-late August and continued through mid-September. The build-up to harvest was interrupted by two wildfires toward fall. The vintage ended midway through the harvest season, with the fruit for this wine picked from September 29 through October 9. The vineyard and winery teams worked under extensive safety protocols due to the COVID pandemic throughout the vintage.

####  Vineyards 

The St. Helena Home Vineyard is largely responsible for the establishment of Beringer Vineyards because this site, situated around the present-day winery, first attracted founder Jacob Beringer to the property in 1875. The vineyard is formed on a sloped alluvial fan of rock and gravelly soils with little capacity to hold water. Planted exclusively to Cabernet Sauvignon, its fruit has been a component of the Private Reserve Cabernet since 1982. St. Helena Home Vineyard Cabernet is characterized by classic Cabernet flavors of berries and black cherries, layered with licorice and spice and a fleshy mid-palate.
