The 2022 Year of the Snake Cabernet Sauvignon dazzles with its deep, saturated color and radiant vibrancy. Aromas unfold gracefully, beginning with an enticing bouquet of ripe black cherries, blueberry compote, and cassis. Layers of dark chocolate, anise, and a hint of sweet baking spice—courtesy of well-integrated oak—enhance the aromatic complexity. A plush and velvety entry evolves into a full-bodied palate, showcasing concentrated flavors of black fruit, mocha, and subtle hints of cardamom. The fine-grained, mountain-derived tannins provide a robust yet elegant structure, balanced by vibrant acidity that carries the wine through a long, dynamic finish.

####  Vintage 

The 2022 vintage is marked by the resilience and adaptability of Napa Valley’s grape growers. A challenging yet rewarding season, it began with a frenetic harvest pace due to a compacted schedule, intensified by early September heatwaves and sudden mid-harvest rains. Grapes harvested after the rains benefited from mild, temperate conditions throughout October, achieving ideal ripeness. This duality shaped a wine with luxurious tannins, exquisite aromatics, and remarkable fruit expression, encapsulating the balance and power that define Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon at its finest.

####  Vineyards 

Crafted from the unique terroir of the St. Helena AVA, this wine embodies the lush and generous qualities of the region. Nestled on the northern Napa Valley floor, St. Helena’s warm temperatures and alluvial soils yield Cabernet Sauvignon with decadent ripeness and depth. The volcanic soils in the eastern portions lend structure and minerality, while the proximity to the Mayacamas Mountains provides some protection from the hot afternoon sun, preserving freshness and balance. Small-berried clusters with ideal skin-to-pulp ratios result in a wine of remarkable concentration and texture.
