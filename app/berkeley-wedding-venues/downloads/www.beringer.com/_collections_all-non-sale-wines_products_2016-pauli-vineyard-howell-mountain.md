Antonio Galloni, Vinous

> The 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon Vogt Vineyard is one of the more distinctive wines in the range. Graphite, smoke, grilled herbs, lavender, menthol and inky blue/purplish fruit abound in this potent, muscular Cabernet. Even with all of its size, the 2016 is vivid and finely sketched. Moreover, it is one of the more compelling wines in this range.

####  Vintage 

A dry January was followed by a wet February, while temperatures remained mild. Bud break was early but slowed as April arrived with consistent showers. The growing season proceeded at a leisurely pace, allowing fruit to reach full maturity with balanced acid and complex layers of flavor.

####  Vineyards 

Pauli Vineyard is located on Howell Mountain. The 15-acre vineyard has volcanic-based soils that are restrictive and thus foster grapes of great intensity and structure. Pauli Vineyard first appeared in the Private Reserve blend at the 2009 vintage. Pauli Cabernet shows a luscious fruit core from the outset, accentuated by ripe tannins.
