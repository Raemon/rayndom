Deep ruby in the glass with astounding aromas of black currant, blackberry and oak spice, the Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon promises a luxurious experience. On the palate, dense fruit flavors mesh perfectly with sweet tobacco notes, with a nice finish of vanillin with hints of pencil lead, sage, and loam. A strong tannin structure and high acidity imply that long ageing and evolution in the cellar are probable for the next few decades. Drink now with an hour decant, or cellar for up to 25 years.

####  Vintage 

Welcomed winter rain in January and February of 2018 eased long drought conditions. After a relatively wet winter, both bud break and flowering occurred later than average, but under ideal weather conditions, creating plentiful and even fruit set. Warm summer temperatures with generous sun exposure moderated by cool marine influences in the mornings and evenings, allowed for a long summer growing season, virtually uninterrupted by any major heat spikes. The mild summer run was followed by extended fall sunshine with moderate heat and no early rains, creating near-ideal conditions to allow fruit extended hang time for gradual ripening, increase sugar levels and flavor complexity development.

####  Vineyards 

Our inaugural vintage of the newest addition to the Beringer Single-Vineyard lineup, the 2018 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon. Named after the stagecoach trail which ran from St. Helena to Monticello during the 1800s, Stagecoach Vineyard hosts some of the most extreme terroir in all of Napa Valley. Steep mountains, rocky soils, and high elevation – vineyard resides in the venerable Atlas Peak AVA, on the Eastern edge of Napa Valley where its southerly aspect ensures that the fruit receives direct daylight throughout the day. Described as a “hanging bowl” – akin to a valley high in the mountains, Stagecoach has produced incredible Cabernet Sauvignon fruit sought-after by winemakers Napa-wide.
