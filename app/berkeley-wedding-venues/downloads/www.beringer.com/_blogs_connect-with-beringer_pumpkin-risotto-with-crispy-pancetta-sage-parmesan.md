# Cabernet & Pumpkin Risotto

Nov 1, 2025

![Cabernet & Pumpkin Risotto](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/PumpkinRisotto_Header.jpg?v=1761676317&width=320)

## Paired with the Private Reserve Cabernet 

Prep Time: 15 mins | Cook Time: 30 mins | Serving Size: 4

Creamy, cozy, and undeniably autumnal, this pumpkin risotto is comfort food dressed up for the season. The sweetness of pumpkin meets the saltiness of pancetta and the crisp aroma of fried sage, creating a beautiful balance of flavor and texture. Each bite feels like a warm welcome to fall, and when paired with a glass of our Private Reserve Cabernet, the wine’s rich layers of blackberry and spice bring out the dish’s earthy depth. Perfect for a chilly evening at home or a dinner party centerpiece.

### Ingredients

  * 1 ½ cups arborio rice
  * 4 cups chicken or vegetable stock (kept warm)
  * 1 cup pumpkin purée (unsweetened)
  * 1 small onion, finely chopped
  * 2 tbsp olive oil
  * ½ cup dry white wine
  * ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
  * 2 tbsp butter
  * 4 -6 ounces of pancetta
  * Fresh sage leaves (6–8)
  * Salt & pepper to taste



### Instructions

  1. In a large pan, warm olive oil and sauté onion until translucent.
  2. Stir in arborio rice, toasting lightly for 1–2 minutes.
  3. Deglaze with white wine, stirring until absorbed.
  4. Gradually add warm stock, one ladle at a time, stirring until each addition is absorbed. Continue 18–20 minutes until rice is creamy and al dente.
  5. Stir in pumpkin purée, butter, and Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper.
  6. In a small skillet, fry pancetta and sage leaves in olive oil until crisp. Drain on paper towels.
  7. Serve risotto warm, topped with crispy sage and extra Parmesan.
