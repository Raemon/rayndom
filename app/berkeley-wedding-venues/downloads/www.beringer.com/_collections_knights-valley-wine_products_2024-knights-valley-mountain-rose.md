Bright salmon pink with a rose gold rim, the 2024 Mountain Rosé bursts with aromas of white peach, watermelon rind, and rose petal. Made using the cold stabulation technique to preserve freshness and enhance aromatics, it offers a plush texture balanced by crisp acidity. Flavors of wild strawberry, guava, and a hint of ruby grapefruit carry through to a clean, refreshing finish. Best enjoyed fresh on warm days or cool summer nights.

#### Winemaking

Crafted to be aromatic, bright, and fruit-forward, the grapes for our Mountain Rosé are picked at night to take advantage of cool temperatures. Once destemmed, the berries are left for a few hours in the press to provide a very light touch of color. After a very controlled and soft pressing, the ‘stabulation’ technique is implemented where the juice is kept cold at around 30°F-32°F and mixed daily for several days before beginning its fermentation. This imparts more flavor and helps the wine develop even more aromatic intensity. The fermentation itself is low and slow at 55°F and can often take weeks to complete. Once fermentation is completed, the wine is racked clean off its lees and stored in stainless steel vessels to preserve the bright aromatics for bottling.

####  Vineyards 

Located in a remote, bucolic region of Sonoma County, just 17 miles north of the Beringer Napa winery, Knights Valley lies in the shadow of Mount St. Helena. There, hilly terrain descends to rocky, alluvial soils where ancient rivers once ran. Warm during the day and cool at night, this exceptional terroir is ideal for cultivating Bordeaux-style wines.
