# Beringer Vineyards 2022 Harvest

Oct 1, 2022

![Beringer Vineyards 2022 Harvest](//www.beringer.com/cdn/shop/articles/BER_Vineyards_22.jpg?v=1769041808&width=320)

_A year both wild and refined._

## Growing Season

The season started with below-average rainfall, extending California’s drought conditions for a third year. However, a few large rainfall events filled reservoirs in Napa and Sonoma, improving early growing conditions substantially from 2021. For the first time in several years, frost occurred at the beginning of the growing season, but vineyards were largely protected in coastal regions. Temperatures for the growing season through the start of harvest were moderate ensuring good canopies and early ripening conditions across California.

## Harvest

The first half of the 2022 harvest started calm and early with healthy vineyards offering fruit with bright acidity, fruit-forward flavors, and strong yields for whites and Pinot Noir. Then, California experienced a historic heat wave in early September that ramped up the pace of ripening, compelling a fast and furious harvest as winemakers worked to pick fruit at its best quality. Fortunately, strong vines and proactive irrigation helped many vineyards survive the heat. The second half was much more predictable with cooler temperatures through October, so that later-ripening red varieties, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, could develop their full flavor and tannin profile.

## Winter Winery Update

Winter in St. Helena brings a certain calm. With the mad rush of harvest over, the focus shifts to the cellar and winemaking. While this might be a more relaxed time, it is not without its complexities. The wines now resting in barrels must be constantly tested, monitored, and moved to ensure they develop the beautiful flavors and characteristics you expect from Beringer wines. Three main things are happening in the cellar.

### Topping Up

Barrels need to be “topped off” one by one about every six weeks. Because oak is porous, wine naturally evaporates through the staves. Known as the “angel’s share,” this wine must be replaced promptly so that the barrel stays completely full and free of oxygen. While some exchange of air is beneficial and creates unique flavors, too much can interfere with the natural flavors from the fruit.

### Racking and Returning

To clarify the wines and prevent reductive qualities, they undergo a process called “racking and returning” in which they are emptied from the barrel and into a tank. While they are in the tank the barrels are washed to clear the sediment that’s collected at the bottom. Once this is done the wine is pumped back into the barrel to continue its rest.

### Blending

Winter is the winemaker’s time to prepare the blends of the new vintages. This process is distinct for each wine and vintage but always involves careful calculations and sampling to find the perfect balance of aromas and flavors.
