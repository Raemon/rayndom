## Begin at Beringer: The First Chapter

Your experience begins at 10:30 a.m. at Beringer’s historic Rhine House, an architectural landmark built in 1886. Guests are welcomed to enjoy a self-guided tasting of Reserve-tier wines, exploring the elegant balance and character that have defined Beringer for nearly 150 years. Take time to stroll the manicured gardens, admire the heritage stone architecture, and enjoy the serene beauty of our St. Helena estate before your next chapter begins.

## Continue the Journey

After your morning at Beringer, the day unfolds north through the valley:

  * Frank Family Vineyards offers an intimate seated tasting of estate-grown wines in the relaxed charm of their Craftsman House or shaded courtyard.  

  * Sterling Vineyards provides a breathtaking finale — an aerial gondola ascent to the Hilltop Tasting Room, where guests savor winery-exclusive wines paired with local cheese and charcuterie while overlooking panoramic views of Napa Valley.
