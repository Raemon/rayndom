### Racing

Golden Gate Yacht Club Race Committee is an active volunteer organization with a fine tradition of race management over the Club’s 72-year history. Committee members are active participants in both US Sailing and Yacht Racing Association training events.

Golden Gate Yacht Club is the organizing authority and supports some of the most popular Bay Area regattas: the 48th annual Manuel Fagundes Seaweed Soup Regatta, the Double Handed Farallones Race, and of course the the GGYC 9 race Friday Night Beer Can Series.

In addition to the GGYC regattas listed above, each year the Race Committee manages various Yacht Racing Association (YRA) sponsored races for Wooden Boat Racing Association, Singlehanded Sailing Society, One Design Class Association, and Ocean Yacht Racing Association.
