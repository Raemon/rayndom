The GGYC Youth Sailing Foundation’s mission is to provide safe and fun youth sailing programs for all Bay Area kids. Our ethos is teaching Life Skills through Sailing. Our goals are to provide youth sailing programs that are fun, educational, and accessible. GGYC’s waterfront is a great place for student sailors to learn sailing, racing, and build lifelong friendships.

**The High School Racing Program** is open to the public and currently hosts teams from Lowell, School of the Arts, Drew, Galileo, and Riordan Archbishop. Junior Varsity students learn basic boat handling skills and racing rules on the collegiate flying junior (CFJ). Varsity sailors learn racing tactics on the double-handed [CFJs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Junior) and more advanced [C420.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_420) When not training on the CFJ, GGYC youth members are encouraged to train on the club’s fleet of C420s, RS Fevas, Lasers and J22s.

Over the past 25 years, GGYC coaches have coached and mentored hundreds of bay area youth and students from the School of the Arts, Mission, Lowell, Galileo, Gateway, Lycee Francais, French American, Drew, Riordan Archbishop and City Arts & Tech. GGYC is committed to building a diverse sailing community and welcomes students from all backgrounds. We are very excited about our programs in 2020 and look forward to a great year of sailing!

### **High School Race Team**

****  
**Requirements**  
The ability to swim 50 yards is required. Enthusiasm, commitment and a sincere desire to learn to race in regattas are essential. Students need to have their own wet-suit, sailing boots, gloves, lifejacket, and a bailer (aka Arizona Ice Tea jug). The following forms are required before sailing:

  * Student Information
  * Medical Information and Directives
  * Liability waiver (parents please print, sign and bring to first practice)



Fall season runs Sept-Dec and is limited to 25 students. Registration fees offsets coaching, sailing expenses, travel costs and boat maintenance. Parents are required to pay registration fees for regattas, normally $25 per day. Scholarships are available to qualifying students. For more information about scholarships email the waterfront director at [waterfront@ggyc.com](mailto:waterfront@ggyc.com)

**Regattas**

Regattas provide great opportunities for students to build confidence racing, working on their leadership skills and life long sailing friends. Coaches, students, and parents collectively decide which regattas to attend. Parents are responsible for student regatta registration, transportation, and daily lunches. A GGYC coaches will attend each regatta on the GGYC coach boat for safety and coaching.

**Support the Students**  
The GGYC Youth Sailing Programs are only possible through the great volunteer efforts of our club coaches, parents, sponsors, members and donors. We believe youth sailing provides today’s youth with invaluable life skills in teamwork, confidence, trust and friendship.

If you would like to become a volunteer or donate to the GGYC Youth Sailing Foundation, please contact the Waterfront Director at [waterfront@ggyc.com](mailto:waterfront@ggyc.com)[.](mailto:ggycwaterfront@gmail.com)

Thank you for visiting and we look forward to the upcoming sailing season!
