### Club Sailing for Members

GGYC provides access to crew opportunities with our experienced sailors when our club boats participate in select regattas.

Members should visit the #waterfront channel in our member Slack workspace for details on all club sailing opportunities.

### FAQs

_Do you have boats available for rent?_

Unfortunately, at this time we are not able to rent our club boats to members. Please consider joining us for hosted sailing opportunities through our Club Sailing program.

_Do you have a racing program?_

While many of our members race their own boats or crew with other racers throughout the bay, the club itself does not have a racing team. We encourage members to network with each other as many boat owners are always looking for crew!

_Do you offer sailing classes such as the[ASA Certifications](https://asa.com/)?_

Golden Gate Yacht Club does not offer certification courses, however, we recommend visiting the ASA or US Sailing websites for a list of schools and classes in the area.

### Docks

Transient slip reservations are available to members of GGYC and members of reciprocal clubs. All persons interested in reserving a GGYC slip should email [GGYC Slip Reservations](mailto:generalmanager@ggyc.com,%20ggycwaterfront@gmail.com?subject=Slip%20Reservation "Slip Reservation").
