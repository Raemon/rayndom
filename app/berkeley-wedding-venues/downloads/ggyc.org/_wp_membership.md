# Join The GGYC and become a member of an active yacht club with a wide variety of sailing and club offerings available to its members.

Founded in 1939 as the Puerto de Oro Yacht Club (Port of the Golden Harbor). Our founding fathers started the club as a foundation to promote both water sports and affordable boating to our local community. This has remained our mainstay and is one of the focal points of our Club adding to our reputation of being the “Friendliest Club on the Bay” and allows for camaraderie with fellow sailors from around the Bay and beyond.

The Golden Gate Yacht Club is a fully functional yacht club with a full-time staff and nearly three hundred members. The Golden Gate Yacht Club welcomes non boaters, sail and power boaters and their crew to its membership ranks. Membership in the GGYC also affords reciprocal rights to the City Club of San Francisco, University Club and Marine’s Memorial as well as most yacht clubs worldwide.

Members enjoy social activities such as Opening Day on the Bay, our renowned Lobster Feed, Fleet Week Bar-b-Que (best view on the Bay to see the Fleet arrive and watch the Blue Angels perform), Bunny and Santa-by-Boat Brunches, San Francisco Firemen’s Toy Drive for Under Privileged Children, New Year’s Day Brunch and other themed events.

The GGYC also offers bar and dining service with dazzling views of San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, and Marin.

  * First class facility on San Francisco Bay with rooms, decks and balconies that offer breathtaking panoramic Golden Gate and bay views.
