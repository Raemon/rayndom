# Race Volunteers

##  Race Committee Volunteer Sign Up 

Our internationally renowned racing program would not be possible without the support of dedicated member and non-member volunteers from the broader sailing community. Volunteering for Race Committee is a great way to give back to the Club, meet new people, learn more about racing and get acquainted with the Club if you're hoping to apply for membership. 

If there's been a change in your availability, please contact the Race Office at [415-789-5647](tel:+4157895647 "Click to make a Call") or by emailing [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
