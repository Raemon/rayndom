# Optimist Harken #2 (Youth)

Now in its 15th year, the Harken Challenge Series is a spring series with two regattas in SoCal and two in NorCal. The second stop in this four-regatta series welcomed 73 boats from all over California. This year saw familiar spring conditions with long waits for wind on the Southampton racecourse. The days on the water were very long but the waits paid off with five great races over the two days in predominately 8-12 knots, and 16-17 at the tail-end of Saturday.
