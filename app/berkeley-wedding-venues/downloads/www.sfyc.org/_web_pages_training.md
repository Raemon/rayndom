In 2003 World Sailing introduced a standard basic syllabus for the training of safety courses in order to establish an internationally recognized qualification. The training requirements form part of the World Sailing Offshore Special Regulation. These courses are run and established by World Sailing Member National Authorities and conform to World Sailing minimum standards.   


##  Course topics include:  
Emergency procedures  
Liferaft operation and in-the-water training  
Flare use and training  
Fire extinguisher training  
Preventative maintenance checklists  
Coast Guard communications****

The following courses are also offered (as noted) at SFYC, in conjunction with the Safety at Sea week. 

### CCA Safety for Cruising Couples - NOT CURRENTLY OFFERED

The Cruising Club of America’s Safety for Cruising Couples course will be presented by Ashley Perrin and Moe Roddy, members of both CCA and SFYC, on April 19-20 from 5:30–8:00pm. This course is free of charge with free drinks and snacks. Plus, your Cruise Committee will provide a free course book to the first 10 couples who register!  
  
  
The course covers a range of essential safety practices, with emphasis on completing a safe voyage with a small crew or a less experienced first mate. Topics include Skipper and Crew Partnership, Position and Navigation, Communications in an Emergency and Dealing with Emergencies. Pre-course learning and documents will be sent out to registered persons a week before the course. For more, check out the [CCA’s Course video](https://sas.cruisingclub.org/scc/video)  


### VHF Certification - NOT CURRENTLY OFFERED

#### 

  * Sign up and take the online course [here](https://searegs.co.uk/online-vhf-src-course/) (Course fee payable to SeaRegs) 
  * Sign up to take the EXAM at SFYC at 6pm on Oct 21 [here](https://www.regattanetwork.com/clubmgmt/applet_registration_form.php?regatta_id=25033) ([registrant list](https://www.regattanetwork.com/clubmgmt/applet_registrant_list.php?regatta_id=25033&custom_report_id=43))

  * [Course Docs & Videos](http://www.racingyachtmanagement.com/vhf.php)



The Short Range Certificate is the minimum qualification required by law to control the operation of VHF and VHF Digital Selective Calling (DSC) equipment fitted with a radio. This includes both fixed and hand held equipment using International channels outside US territorial waters. 

A radio is an important piece of safety equipment on board and it is vital to understand the correct procedures. Unnecessary transmissions could block out a Mayday distress call. All new VHF sets are either fitted, or can be interfaced, with DSC allowing calls to specific vessels. 

Course topics include: 

  * Basics of radio operation 
  * Correct frequencies (channels) to be used 
  * Distress, emergency and medical assistance procedures 
  * Making ship to shore telephone calls 
  * Digital Selective Calling (DSC) using simulators 
  * Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) 
  * Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRB) 
  * Search and Rescue (SART) 



The course will be taught using radio simulators.
