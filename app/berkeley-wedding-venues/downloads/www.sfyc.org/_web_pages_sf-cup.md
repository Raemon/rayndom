# SF Cup @ SFYC

3/30/2019, 3/31/2019

## True to the Deed

Good fellowship and friendly competition: those words were paramount when the Deed of Gift was written for the San Francisco Cup in 1967. This past weekend, the 47th running of the Cup demonstrated that these words still resonate.  
  
Sailing Director Forrest Gay reported, "Conditions were glorious with 8-13 knots directly from the Golden Gate and sunshine all weekend. SFYC's Youth team dominated their St. Francis opponents with 4 wins out of 5 races, but that was not enough to retain the Cup. St. Francis walked away with the Open and Women's Divisions and returned the SF Cup to the south side of the Bay. Congratulations to Team St. Francis for a well-sailed regatta."  
  
Thank you to SFYC skippers**Tim Russell, Stephanie Wondolleck, Nicholas Sessions** and your respective crews – you made The San Francisco Yacht Club proud! We will work hard to bring the Cup back to the proper side of the Bay next year.  
  
On Saturday night, we hosted the SF Cup dinner where the friendly spirit between the two clubs was palatable. Chef Reny outdid himself with a delicious meal and the dining and bar staff provided great service to the hungry sailors and their guests.  
  
A big thank you to **Ryan Simmons** for loaning us his J/105,Blackhawk, for racing and to **Charles Pick** and **Greg Arkus** for lending their J/105s for sparring practice. A giant thanks to**Marcel Houtzager** for providing his Protector, Gizmo, to serve as our signal vessel when Victory decided to take a holiday (engine problems) prior to the first race.
