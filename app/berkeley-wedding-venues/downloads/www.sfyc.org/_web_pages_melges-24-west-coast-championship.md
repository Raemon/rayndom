## Duane Yoslov Wins Melges 24 West Coast Championship 

The Melges 24 fleet was back at The SFYC for a three-day regatta this past weekend. Six races over the first two days were held on the Berkeley Circle in plenty of breeze. Nothing under 18 knots and peaking at 29 on Saturday, which made for some wild rides and sore sailors. Sunday's 2-hour "Bay Tour" race from Knox was a welcome reprieve from the punishing Circle conditions.   
  
Congratulations to Duane Yoslov on Looper, who posted five wins and two seconds over seven races, winning the regatta.   
  
The race committee was led by PRO Forrest Gay, with S/C Suzie Moore, Jane Elkins, Roxanne Fairbairn, Larry Stoehr, Karen Bauer, Torben Hoy, Linda Mendell, Andy Mendell, Andrew Picel, Mary Menninger, Christina Phillip and Mason McCloskey. The protest committee was Danielle Lawson, Rob Overton and Paul Zupan.
