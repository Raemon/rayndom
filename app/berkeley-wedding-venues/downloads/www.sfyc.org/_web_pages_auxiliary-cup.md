# The Auxiliary Cup

## Lundh and Finn Win the 5th Annual Auxiliary Cup 

On Saturday, September 28, 2019, SFYC hosted the 5th Annual SFYC Auxiliary Cup, chaired by Camille Jampolsky and raced by SFYC women members on 10 boats. The breeze was not our typical summer conditions, but rather a blustery northwesterly. All boats fared well for the one race and then returned to the club for the social festivities, with wine and beer sponsored by Dry Creek Vineyards and Fort Point Brewery.   
  
In honor of this anniversary and the event founders, the Auxiliary Cup Founders' Sportsmanship Award was established. P/P Carol Jesmore was selected for this very important honor for her support and mentoring of other women sailors.   
  
Congratulations to the winners: 

  * Spinnaker: Tina Lundh, Ashley Perrin, Alicia Magdaleno, Liga Hoy on Flashman
  * Non-Spinnaker: Andrea Finn, Frances Barbour, Caroline Lane on Just 'Em



The race committee was led by PRO S/C Bill Melbostad, with Glenn Isaacson, Bill Kircher, Don Wieneke, Jane Elkins, Bryan Moore and Hal McCormack. 

## We hope to see you at next year's Auxiliary Cup!
