# Belvedere Classic Regatta (Including Great Schooner Race)

Saturday, July 13, 2019

Fourteen classic yachts and schooners graced our Club for the 2019 rendition of the Great San Francisco Schooner Race this past weekend. The Bay-tour race took place on Saturday, starting with summer fog and finishing under glorious sunshine. Congrats to Brigadoon for taking 1st in Schooners and Cuckoo for taking 1st in Classics.  
  
Back at the docks, the fleet was a feast for the eyes. The Matthew Turner made an appearance in support of the regatta and was open for tours, thanks to Alan & Angie Olson. All of these yachts represent an earlier time in sailing, with their graceful lines, gleaming bright work, wooden hulls and glistening brass. Restoring them is as great a passion as sailing them, as we have witnessed with Water Witch, painstakingly restored by the Egelston family.  
  
Thank you to S/C John Swain for your vision eleven years ago to celebrate these majestic yachts with this event!  
  
This weekend's RC was led by PRO S/C Bill Melbostad, with S/C Suzie Moore, Lynnie Spiller, Bill Kircher, Angie Lackey, Susan Sanders and Larry Stoehr.
