##  The San Francisco Yacht Club Facilities 

The San Francisco Yacht Club maintains one of the country's finest yachting facilities. Amongst these are a charming clubhouse, a large harbor with individual slips, a dry boat storage facility, a large floating dock for use by the Youth Sailing Program and small boats, a full service dining room and bar, along with a sunny deck where one can enjoy sailing friendships after racing. 

Lunch and dinner are served Thursday through Sunday. Dinner is served Wednesday through Sunday. Additionally, breakfast is served on Saturday and Sunday and summer BBQs are served on Friday evenings on the beautiful deck. 

Visiting Yachtsmen who are members in good standing of any Club in the world which offers use of its comparable facilities, to members of The San Francisco Yacht Club, are welcome. Please click on our "Upon Arrival" page under the "Visitor Info" tab near the top of the screen. 

###  Corinthian Deck 

  
SFYC has a large deck in front of the main Clubhouse. Dining is offered on the deck whenever weather permits. Please ask if the deck is scheduled to be open when making your reservation. Occasionally the deck may be closed with little notice due to weather. 

The eastern portion of the deck extending towards the '0' dock is referred to as the Corinthian Deck and often has lounge and bar stools setup for cocktails when weather permits. Only members' dogs are allowed on this portion of the deck. No dogs are allowed on any other areas of the deck.
