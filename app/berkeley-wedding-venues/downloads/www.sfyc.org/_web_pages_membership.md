# Membership

The San Francisco Yacht Club was founded to encourage yachting and assist members in becoming proficient in a wide range of water- and boat-centric pursuits. Club Members are entitled to use our facilities, participate in a wide range of regattas and cruises, and enjoy activities and social events at the Club.  
  
We welcome applications for membership from boaters who share our love of the water and would like to join our active community. The application process begins when a Voting Member of the Club obtains an application packet and becomes the applicant's primary sponsor. Each candidate needs a Proposer and a Seconder, and at least four other Club Members to serve as recommenders and provide references. A candidate's personal and boating background are reviewed as part of the application process, with a strong focus on the applicant's on-the-water experience.  
  
We understand that some boaters may not have the required personal connections to the Club. Member participation is a key element of The San Francisco Yacht Club, and one way of building a relationship with the Club and its members is to volunteer for some on-the-water or land-based activities. Please visit our [Race Volunteer page](https://www.sfyc.org/web/pages/race-volunteers) for more information.
