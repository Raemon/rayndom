# Regattas

The San Francisco Yacht Club has a long tradition of sailing and racing excellence dating back more than 150 years. Members of the SFYC have won Olympic medals and raced in all corners of the globe. Wide recognition of the Club's race management capabilities have enabled the SFYC to attract significant national and international championship regattas. The race program is supported by dedicated SFYC members and members of the broader sailing community who volunteer more than 4,800 hours each year, enabling sailors from all over the world to sail in the world-renowned San Francisco Bay breeze and visit beautiful Marin County.  
  
Head to the 'Race Volunteers' tab to get involved as a race committee volunteer this season.
