# Multihull Regatta

![](/documents/10184/23014/Multihull+Regatta.jpg)   
  
On September 27–28, ten boats in two fleets raced six races in SFYC's 2019 Multihull Regatta. Saturday's racing was in a shifty, strange northwesterly at Southampton, and then Sunday was sailed at Knox. The race committee was led by PRO Jeff Zarwell, with Roxanne Fairbairn, Jack McLaughlin, Larry Stoehr, Richard Cave, Mary Grant, Kevin Burke and Greg Owen. 

## We hope to see you at next year's Multihull Regatta!
