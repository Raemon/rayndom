# Wosser Cup (Club Series)

##  The 2019 Wosser Cup 

The final regatta of the Club Championship Series took place in beautiful medium breeze once it finally filled in. Two short races were managed after starting at 1400 hours. Ruth Wosser spent the afternoon on the deck in the sun awaiting the return of the racers, and then was in attendance for the awarding of the trophies. In Spinnaker 1, Peregrine edged out Ragtime in a tie-break for the regatta win.  
  
The race committee was lead by PRO Steve Fentress, with Shawn Davies, Karen Bauer, Helga Guba, Jay Hooker, Kevin Burke, Larry Stoehr, and Richard Cave. 

##  We hope to see you at next year's Wosser Cup!
