# Harbor

##  Our Berthing Facilities 

Berthing facilities for visitors are located directly in front of the Clubhouse deck. Visitors may not enter any slip or tie up anywhere else in the harbor without first obtaining permission from either the Port Captain, the Harbor personnel, the General Manager or other designated officer. All visiting yachts must fly their burgee. Charges for the use of the Club Dock are as set forth in the Club Dock Rules, listed below. 

The Club may, from time to time, restrict guest berthing for scheduled Club events, regattas, cruise-ins and holidays. Visitors seeking accommodations should phone ahead to determine space availability, noting that space is on a first-come, first-served basis. 

Heads are available inside the Clubhouse, and heads and showers are available in the Sailing Center. 

The Club has 190 slips ranging from 24 to 52 feet in length. There are 83 dry storage spaces along with room for storage of rowing shells and several dinghy racks. 

In most cases, dress is casual and informal. Shirts and footwear must be worn at all times when in the Clubhouse. Alcoholic beverages may not be brought onto or removed from the Club premises at any time. Ice is available on request from the bartender, and in freezer in front of the Sailing Center. The Clubhouse opens at 8:00am Tuesday–Sunday.
