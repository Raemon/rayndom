# Midnight Moonlight Maritime Marathon

Saturday, July 20, 2019   
  
![](/documents/10184/21573/Midnight+Moonlight+Maritime+Marathon.jpg)  
  
SFYC's only night race took place on Saturday with boats racing from Raccoon Strait around the Carquenez Bridge and back. This year's current certainly favored the first starters (little boats) as they rode the flood up and the ebb turned on during their return. Richard von Ehrenkrook's Cal 20 Can 'Whoopass was the run-away winner that no one could catch.   
  
The race committee was led by PRO Jeff Zarwell, with Forrest Gay and S/C Suzie Moore running the starts and Roxanne Fairbairn staying out late with Jeff for the night finishes.
