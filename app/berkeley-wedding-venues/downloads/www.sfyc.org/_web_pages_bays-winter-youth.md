# BAYS Winter Youth #4

On March 16–17, The SFYC hosted the final Bay Area Youth Sailing Winter Series regatta. High pressure dominated the weather, making for a beautiful weekend with very little wind forecast. Despite the iffy forecast, the Southampton race area delivered some of the best conditions possible for youth racing, with 8-12 knots of steady breeze for all six scheduled races. The Opti Green Fleet and CFJs struggled to find any breeze in the Cove both days, so went to Richardson Bay on Sunday where they were able to get in the remainder of their six races.
