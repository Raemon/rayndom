On the 4th of July, SFYC hosted an all-new race: The Fireworks Folly, open to all boats on the Bay. The pursuit race started early and featured some interesting tactical decisions to keep things fun and interesting. All boats were back in time to enjoy the BBQ and festivities.   
  
The race committee was led by Don Wieneke, S/C Suzie Moore, Karen Bauer, Helga Guba, Bill Kircher, Dave Krone, Mary Anne Krone, Susan Sanders, Moe Roddy and Mario Valente.   
  
**The top three across the line all came up from east of Angel Island to surprise the previous leaders:**

  * Second: Flashman, Ashley Perrin 
  * Third: Tiburon, Steve Stroub
