# Farallones Race (Full-Crewed)

Saturday, June 08, 2019

Sunday's weather was perfect for the Farallones Race. A light northerly at the start turned into a moderate northwesterly for the trip out and back, which brought everyone home well before dark. Congratulations to SFYC boats on the podium: Blue (1st in PHRO1), Peregrine (2nd in PHRO1), and Bloom County (2nd in PHRO2).
