# Round the Island Race

Saturday, October 31, 2020   
  
SFYC's racing season ended on Halloween with the regularly scheduled Round the Island Race. The race was run in "normal" fashion, the first one this season, with Jay Hooker as PRO. Forrest and Roxanne assisted in a COVID compliant short-handed race committee. Light fall conditions met the fleet on Knox with a northerly at the start. The course was just to Alcatraz, Southampton and return, in pretty unpredictable wind. A large hole developed mid-Bay after the start but then a light westerly filled in to get the fleet around Alcatraz. Around Point Blunt, the fleet transitioned back into the northerly, which held strong all the way back into Racoon Strait, where they were "ebbed" across the finish line. A good turnout of 26 boats made it around the course!   
  
Don Jesberg's Viva took the win in the Spinnaker Division, a first for this boat but not the first time for the Jesberg family.   
  
Glenn Isaacson's Q won the Non-spinnaker Division handily.
