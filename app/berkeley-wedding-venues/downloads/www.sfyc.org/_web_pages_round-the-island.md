# Round the Island Race

##  Regatta Recap: Round the Island Race 

This year's Round the Island Race was moved to be earlier in the year in the hopes of finding good wind. Despite this, the wind was slow to fill and only built to about 6-10 knots after 1:00pm on Saturday. Instead of going all the way around Yerba Buena, which is the primary course, the race committee sent the fleets around Angel Island. The Fleet Week airshow provided some additional entertainment for the 21 boats who enjoyed a beautiful day on the water.   
  
Spinnaker Winner: Orca, Will Baylis and Rich Bergsund  
Non-Spinnaker Winner (scores corrected Sunday): Q, Glenn Isaacson   
  
The race committee was led by PRO Jay Hooker, with Karen Bauer, Helga Guba, Bill Kircher, Dave Krone, Mary Anne Krone, Jeff Zarwell, Larry Stoehr, and Richard Cave.
