# From the Commodore

Dear Members,  
  
It is an incredible honor to represent our club as your Commodore for its 157th year. Any club that remains relevant and vibrant for that many years is truly a special place.  
  
We are blessed to call this magical cove our home. Our beautiful facilities and spectacular harbor provide an exceptional setting from which to embark on our sailing, racing, cruising, paddling, swimming and fishing adventures. Yet what makes it truly special is the opportunity to share it all with like-minded Members.  
  
When I think about our club’s long history, I am reminded that none of this would be possible if it wasn’t for our volunteers. Our club is a complex operation to manage. In addition to our wonderful staff, today we have around 20 volunteer committees that meet at least monthly to keep it all going.  
  
It is no accident that we have the best Youth Sailing program on the Bay, that we host prestigious regattas, count some of the most accomplished sailors in the world as Members, and that we are ranked #20 in Yacht Clubs in Platinum Clubs of America and top 50 in Platinum Clubs of the World. That would be impossible without our volunteers. For those of you who may have not volunteered yet, I would encourage you to raise your hand. The more you put into the club, the more you will get out of it. Please reach out any committee chair if you are interested in learning more or feel free to reach out to me directly.  
  
See you at the Club!  
  
**Jeffrey Cusack**  
Commodore
