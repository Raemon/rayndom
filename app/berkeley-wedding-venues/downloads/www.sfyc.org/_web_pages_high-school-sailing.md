# High School Sailing

##  High School Sailing At SFYC 

SFYC supports Marin County High School Teams through individual annual agreements with each team. Schools that currently practice at the SFYC facility are: Redwood and San Domenico. SFYC would also accept teams from Marin Catholic, Marin Academy, and Branson if they desired. Each team has a Parent Board that organizes the team and facilitates the practice and facilies usage agreement with SFYC. These teams represent their schools at regattas, and are solely organized by their Parent Boards. 

Please contact your school's team leader for more information about that specific school's team.

###  What is High School Sailing? 

An opportunity to learn to race and compete against other high school teams and travel to regattas throughout California. At the highest level, high school sailing leads to national competitions. 

###  How is it organized? 

Currently 90 schools in California and Hawaii are registered in the Pacific Coast Interscholastic Sailing Association (PCISA). Eligibility is open to students in eighth through twelfth grades. The northern California region runs ten regattas each school year and PCISA holds five regattas spread throughout the state. 

###  What boats are sailed? 

Most HS sailing is fleet racing, done in doublehanded dinghies called "FJs" (Flying Juniors). There is also a singlehanded regatta in Lasers and Laser Radials, and one team race in FJs. 

###  How much does it cost? 

The cost to sail is determined by each school's Parent Board at the beginning of the season. Please contact your team for more details. Regatta entry expenses and travel are additional. 

###  High School FJ Development 

The SFYC may host JV development practices for schools who desire them, run by either the varsity sailors or a hired coach. The practices on Friday afternoons run from 4:00-7:00pm. This is not a learn-to-sail program; sailors are expected to have experience sailing FJs prior to participating in this program. 

###  What are the benefits of joining a high school sailing team? 

  * Sailing is a co-educational competitive sport. 
  * Colleges actively recruit talented sailors for their college teams. 
  * Sailing not only involves a high level of physical strength and agility but it teaches students about navigation, physics, the marine environment, SF Bay and the importance of teamwork. 
  * Sailing is a worldwide activity that literally can take you around the globe. 
  * Sailing is a sport that you will enjoy throughout your life.
