Welcome Team Race Enthusiasts!  
  
We plan to have a short discussion/update at the beginning of each session.. Come out in the RS21s and give team racing a try. Some of us remember our high school and college team racing—some of us want to try it out for the first time. All are welcome.  
  
2026 winter/spring/summer team race skills practice dates coming soon.
