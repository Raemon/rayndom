##  2022 Light Green Information: 

Fall/Spring Optimist Light Green Program 

The SFYC Light Green program is intended for those who have Optimist sailing experience, are comfortable sailing the boat solo, and want to continue learning the intricacies of Optimist sailing and how to race. Sailors should be between 7-12 years old, under 85 lbs., and less than 5' feet tall. Participation in the Light Green program is at the sole discretion of the Youth Sailing Director. The goal of our Light Green program is to develop and foster a love for racing on the Bay. **Light Green is not a learn-to-sail program**. Learn to sail programs are offered during the Summer only. 

The group will focus on becoming well-rounded skippers, developing the essential skills necessary to advance into our Green Fleet Race program. The program is designed to have regular practice attendance, focused preparation, and drill-style practices. Each sailor will be taught general rigging, boat balance, sail trim, elementary racing rules and basic race strategy. There will be a regatta at the last day of the session. 

As a participant in our Light Green program, you are NOT required to own your own equipment (boat, sail, rig). Each sailor will use SFYC club equipment during the program. However, **all** participants are required to have adequate gear to wear on the water, including a US Coast Guard approved lifejacket.
