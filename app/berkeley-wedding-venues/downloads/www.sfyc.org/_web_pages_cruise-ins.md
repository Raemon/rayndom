DEPOSIT: A deposit of $500.00 is required to secure your cruise-in. This deposit will be applied to guest dock charges, which are $1.00, per foot, per boat, per night. Should you cancel the cruise-in, the deposit is non-refundable. However, The Club will reimburse the difference in actual guest dock charges. In the case where The San Francisco Yacht Club has to cancel your cruise-in, your deposit will be refunded in full.
