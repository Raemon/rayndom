# Cove House

##  Beautiful facility, unbeatable views. 

On Friday, July 3, 2020, the San Francisco Yacht Club cut the ribbon to mark the opening of our Cove House. This event, and the new building, was years in the making. It was the result of financial generosity from many members and generosity of time, spirit and talent by many more. 

The facility is beautiful and features both indoor and outdoor spaces in which members now host regattas, events, private parties and more. The views from the upstairs deck are second to none and offer a sweeping display of our beautiful harbor. 

At the ribbon-cutting, **S/C Ed Lynch** said: "Today is a new chapter for the SFYC. Over the last eight years there have been hundreds of people involved in bringing this to fruition, from Facilities and Planning Committees, to Finance Committees, to nine commodores and boards, we've all had a hand in contributing to the success of this building. Let's enjoy it."  
  
A virtual tour of the building is viewable below. If you are interested in hosting an event in the Cove House please contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a9cac8ddccdbc0c7cee9dacfd0ca87c6dbce).
