# Knarr and J/105 Regatta

Over the past decade, the J/105s and Knarr one-design fleets have had the greatest participation on the Bay. As a result, they have become the most competitive. The SFYC has long-strived to provide excellent one-design racing, and thus was born the 2019 Knarr and J/105 Regatta, a purpose-built regatta to welcome only the Bay's two best fleets.   
  
Saturday saw plenty of breeze; summer is here! Both fleets raced three races in 20-28 knots. Sunday's breeze was more moderate for the final two races.  
  
The race committee was led by PRO Jeff Zarwell with Lynnie Spiller, Jane Elkins, Madeline Morey, Jack Mclaughlin, S/C Suzie Moore, Linda Mendell, Larry Stoehr, Greg Owen, Roxanne Fairbairn, Andy Mendell, Frank Defesche, Bill Kircher, Shawn Davies, Dave Krone, John Amen, Bryan Moore and Alex Rothenberg. The protest committee was Danielle Lawson, Nadine Franczyk, Thomas Allard, Brent Draney, and Doug Nugent.   
  
Congratulations to Tim Russell's Ne*Ne for winning the J/105 fleet. Knud Wibroe's Snaps III took second in the Knarrs, with Timothy Dowling's Kulani in third.
