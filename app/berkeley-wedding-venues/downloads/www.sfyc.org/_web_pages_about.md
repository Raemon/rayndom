# About

The San Francisco Yacht Club and its members are dedicated to promoting and celebrating yachting and life on the water. Founded in 1869, SFYC is the oldest yacht club in North America west of the Mississippi River. Originally located at San Francisco's China Basin near Mission Rock, the Club moved to its current site in tranquil Belvedere Cove in 1937 after a short time in Sausalito. With its sublime setting, superb harbor and stunning views of the San Francisco skyline, it's widely recognized as a premier yachting facility and one of the finest anchorages in the Bay Area. It operates a year-round facility including the harbor, a dry-sail area, a full-service restaurant and a bar. 

SFYC has earned recognition as one of the leading yacht clubs in the country, hosting local, national and international regattas. Regattas range from the Belvedere Classic to an active youth sailing and race team program. Committed to promoting the sport and Corinthian spirit of sailing, the Club also offers sailing instruction for sailors of all ages. Club fleets include RS21s, J/24s, Optimists, 420s, Lasers and Flying Juniors. SFYC's youth sailors have risen to compete at national, international and Olympic levels. 

The Club serves its active and diverse membership community through a variety of programs, as well as formal and informal social events.
