# Mitchell and Ross Regattas (Club Series)

Saturday, July 27, 2019

## Race Results: Mitchell & Ross Regatta 

This Club Series races were not scored as a regatta, but rather as two separate races each for a separate trophy: the Mitchell and Ross trophies. A heatwave kept the wind to a moderate 8-15 knots for most of the day and the fog burned off to make for a beautiful afternoon.   
  
The race committee was led by PRO Jeff Zarwell with Roxanne Fairbairn, Bill Kircher, Jane Elkins, Moe Roddy, John Super, Tony Scott and Peter McCool.
