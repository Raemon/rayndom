# Youth Sailing

For more than 60 years, San Francisco Yacht Club's youth sailing program has been dedicated to coaching and empowering the next generation of Bay Area competitors and sailing enthusiasts. The SFYC offers a spectrum of individual and team training programs for kids from grade school through high school, and more than 300 young sailors register each year. The Club is proud that "graduates" of its youth sailing program have gone on to compete - and win - at national, international and Olympic levels. The SFYC has hosted a number of national youth championship regattas, and has been honored with the PICYA's Admiral Chester Nimitz Perpetual Trophy for the advancement of youth sailing on multiple occasions.
