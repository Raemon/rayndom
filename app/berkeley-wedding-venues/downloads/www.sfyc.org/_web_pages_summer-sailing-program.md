###  Class Descriptions

####  Harbor Mice

  * Ages: 6-8 / Boat: JY Trainer / Prerequisite: Pass the swim test on the first day.
  * These classes are offered as full-day (9:00am-3:00pm) or half-day: (9:00am-12:00pm or 12:00pm-3:00pm)



We recommend the younger sailors in this class to be swimmers and comfortable in the water. Email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to discuss 6-year-olds' abilities. Entry-level students 8 and younger begin with the stable Opti Cube, which is a simplified Optimist pram. These classes stay in the harbor at first, and place 2 sailors in each boat. This class covers safety, rigging, basic boat handling, and knots. Sailors advance to the Optimist class after successfully completing the Harbor Mice class.

####  Optimist (Level 1, 2, 3/Race)

  * Ages: 9-13 / Prerequisite: Harbor Mice class, previous sailing experience, or age 9.
  * These classes are offered as full-day only (9:00am-3:00pm).



The 8-foot Optimist is the international standard in youth sail training. The "Opti" is specifically designed for junior sailors under 5'4" and 105 lbs. We offer Optimist classes for beginners (Level 1), intermediates (Level 2, typically once a sailor completes two summer sessions), and racers (Level 3, fall/spring sailing or our SFYC Race Team). At the beginning of each session, the class will be broken up into these three groups based on skill level and experience. Boat ownership is encouraged but not required for participation.

####  Double-handed (2 groups: Beginner and Racing)

  * Ages: 12-16 / Boat: CFJ / Prerequisite: >110 lbs, ability to lift your own body weight out of the water.
  * These classes are offered as full-day only (11:00am-4:00pm).



CFJs are the standard in high school and are used widely in collegiate sailing; this 2-person boat will be used to teach safety and good seamanship in a social setting. This course will focus on intermediate skills, but a beginner group will be available for those without experience.

####  Cruising (keelboat)

  * Ages: 10-16 / Boat: J/24.
  * This class is offered as full-day only (9:00am-3:00pm).



With two J/24's ready to go, the Bay will be your playground. In this class there will be 4-6 students per boat and 1 instructor. Safety, seamanship skills and fun will be the focal point of this class. Navigation, anchoring, knots, and becoming a better helmsperson will also be introduced in this class. Last summer this was the class to be in and this summer is no different!
