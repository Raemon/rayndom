# Comedy Uncorked – July 22

July 22, 2023  @  5:30 pm  –  10:00 pm 

Live standup comedy outdoors under the stars continues Saturday, July 22 with headliner Ryan Goodcase. Praised for his smart writing and dry delivery, Ryan became the youngest person to win the World Series of Comedy in 2019. He then won the 45th San Francisco International Comedy Competition in 2021 and became a paid regular at all of the SF clubs, and dozens of other clubs across the country. Now based in LA, we have a rare chance to see him here in Livermore. Joining Ryan are hot up-and-coming comics Chad Opitz and Brooke Heinechen.

Grounds open at 5:30 pm / show starts at 7:30 pm. 

The Matt Finders and Friends band will provide the soundtrack before the show. A variety of food options will be offered by Tasteful Catering and Events, or you may bring in your own pre-show picnic. Wine by the bottle will be sold in the Retzlaff shop. Winery permits do not allow any outside alcohol to be consumed on the grounds. 

Tickets are on sale now at [comedyuncorked.com](https://comedyuncorked.com). These shows always sell out, so get your tickets while available.

A portion of the proceeds benefits Open Heart Kitchen.
