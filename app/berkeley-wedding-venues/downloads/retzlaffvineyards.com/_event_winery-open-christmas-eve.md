# Winery Open Christmas Eve

December 24, 2022  @  12:00 pm  –  3:00 pm 

Join us at the winery for some Christmas Eve cheer! [Reserve your spot](https://retzlaffvineyards.com/wine-tasting-and-picnicing/) to enjoy a bottle on the lawn, or enjoy a wine-tasting session.

**Special holiday hours are 12-3 pm.**

No caterer this day, so feel free to bring your own snacks or lunch. Please remember to dispose of or remove any items you bring to the winery. Cleaning up food waste is a health issue, and a drag, especially on Christmas Eve.
