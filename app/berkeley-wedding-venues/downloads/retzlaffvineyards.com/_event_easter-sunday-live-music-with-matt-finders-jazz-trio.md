# Sold out! Easter Sunday picnic & Live Music with Matt Finders Jazz Trio

### 

April 9, 2023  @  12:00 pm  –  4:30 pm 

The Easter Picnic event is sold out.   


Those with paid reservations will enjoy the best jazz in the Bay Area on our gorgeous lawn on Easter Sunday with The [Matt Finders Jazz Trio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Finders). Plus a special appearance by the Easter Bunny!

A minimum wine purchase is required for all picnic groups. Wine-tasting flights will not be available this holiday.

## The Matt Finders Jazz Trio 

A talented group of seasoned local musicians skillfully performing the American Songbook as well as more contemporary Latin and blues tunes. The performers change from time to time, but they always provide a great soundtrack to your wine day.   


Matt Finders Jazz Trio

## Food Options

You may bring your own picnic or purchase from a selection of snack items and non-alcoholic beverages available in the Retzlaff Wine Shop. No outside alcohol of any kind is allowed.

Wine and live music with the Matt Finders Jazz Trio at Retzlaff Vineyards – a great way to spend Easter Sunday!

## Sorry, this event is sold out.
