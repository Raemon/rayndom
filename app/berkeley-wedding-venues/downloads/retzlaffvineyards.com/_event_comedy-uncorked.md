# Comedy Uncorked

June 25, 2022  @  5:30 pm  –  10:00 pm 

June 25th kicks off our summer comedy series with headliner Ngaio Bealum. This multi-talented comedian is also a musician, writer, actor, juggler, publisher, and cannabis activist who shares his perspective of the world as a pot lover. Joining Ngiao are Mean Dave, Nina G and Pat Griffin. 

Grounds open at 5:30 pm / show starts at 7:30 pm. 

The Matt Finders and Friends band will provide the soundtrack to pre-show wine sales and food sales. A variety of food options will be offered by Tasteful Catering and Events. Sorry, no outside food or alcohol is allowed. 

Tickets are on sale now at [comedyuncorked.com](https://comedyuncorked.com)

A portion of the proceeds benefits Open Heart Kitchen.
