# Live Music with Dave Land

### 

July 23, 2023  @  12:00 pm  –  4:30 pm 

Join us for wine tasting, or a wine picnic outdoors on the lovely Retzlaff picnic grounds, including live music with David “Ouzo” Land. Admission is only with a Wine Tasting or Picnic Table reservation. See our [Visit Us details](https://retzlaffvineyards.com/visit-us/).

## Dave ‘Ouzo’ Land

Dave “Ouzo” Land’s music is a wonderful mix of vintage rock, country, and blues. After learning to play guitar at the age of 13, he spent the next few decades writing, performing, and honing his craft, picking up the nickname “Ouzo” along the way. Dave formed his band, the Downtowners, in 2003, performing what he calls “country-infused vintage rock and roll”. Dave signed with independent record label, Tays International Music (now Blue Tree Records), in 2014 and recorded and released two albums, Just Another Bad Guy in 2014 and Here We Go Again in 2015. His six-song EP, _My Friends Call Me Ouzo_ was released in 2018. Dave (with the Downtowners) also released three videos, “Pirate Eyes”, “(San Francisco Giants) San Francisco Style” and “Rock and Roll Cowboy”.
