## Carman Hammond

Carman Hammond has been a musician all his life. He enjoys impacting and bringing people together around music! Growing up playing in church, most of his professional career has been as a worship leader for various churches around the US. He currently serves locally as the Worship Pastor for Cedar Grove Community Church in Livermore and plays for venues and private events on the side. Carman loves playing from a wide variety of music genres and decades including pop, rock, classics, soul, country, and more. Carman’s specialty is taking well-known songs and creating his own arrangements that fit an acoustic genre, covering songs by Ed Sheeran, The Beatles, Journey, John Legend, Eric Clapton, The Temptations, and more. A great soundtrack to a wonderful day in the vineyard.
