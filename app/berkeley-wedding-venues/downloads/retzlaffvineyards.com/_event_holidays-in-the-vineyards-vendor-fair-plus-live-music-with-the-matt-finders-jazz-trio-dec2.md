# Holidays in the Vineyards w/ Maker’s Market Open to the Public & Live Music with The Matt Finders Jazz Trio

### 

December 2, 2023  @  12:00 pm  –  4:30 pm 

Day 1 of a 2 day event!   
Retzlaff celebrates Holidays in the Vineyards. Sip and shop our Maker’s Market to get ready for the holidays. Enjoy wine by the glass or bottle or in a tasting flight. All with live music. Join us for a Livermore Valley Wine Country holiday tradition!

## Makers Market

## Toys For Tots

Retzlaff Vineyards is a proud participant in this year’s Toys for Tots drive. Bring a smile to a child while you enjoy some holiday cheer at the winery! December 3 is the last day to drop off unwrapped toys and teen gifts in our Toys for Tots bin. 

## Live Music with The Matt Finders Jazz Trio

[The Matt Finders Jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Finders) Trio is a group of seasoned local musicians who skillfully perform the American Songbook as well as more contemporary Latin and Blues tunes. The perfect vibe for a wine day.

_Note: Music will be canceled if rain is forecasted._
