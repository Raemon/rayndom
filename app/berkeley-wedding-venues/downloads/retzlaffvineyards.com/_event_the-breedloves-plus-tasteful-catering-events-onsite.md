# The Breedloves, plus Tasteful Catering & Events onsite

May 29, 2022  @  12:00 pm  –  4:30 pm 

Join us for a great day of music with the Breedloves. [Guitar artists, Jay Kirkland and Barbara Gorin](https://breedlovemusic.com/acoustic-guitar-artists/the-breedloves) are the Breedlove’s Dynamic Duo, whose romantic, original acoustic music and innovative covers shine with their musical chemistry and passion for all things guitar. 

Please make your wine tasting and/or wine picnic table [reservations in advance](https://retzlaffvineyards.com/wine-tasting-and-picnicing/) for this date.

Tasteful Catering and Events will be onsite selling delicious snack and lunch plates, including vegan and vegetarian options. You can even pre-order tamales for pickup: email Vicky at [Order.tastefulcatering@gmail.com](mailto:Order.tastefulcatering@gmail.com). 

Sorry, no outside food is permitted when we have a caterer on-site.
