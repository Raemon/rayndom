# Farewell to Jackson Rohm – Wednesday Night

### Wine sales by the bottle or glass, plus on-site caterer, Your Taco Guy. 

June 8, 2022  @  5:00 pm  –  8:00 pm 

A special Wednesday evening on the lawn as Jackson Rohm performs his final Bay Area show before he and his family move out of state.

Come enjoy Jackson’s acoustic-based pop/rock melodies, his uniquely powerful and expressive voice, jangly guitars, and driving rhythms.

No advance reservations are required!

Your Taco Guy will be on-site selling a variety of Mexican food options. Sorry, but no outside food is allowed on days when we have a caterer on-site. No outside alcohol is allowed, ever. 

Jackson Rohm
