## The Carolyn Sills Combo

“The five-piece [Carolyn Sills Combo](https://www.carolynsills.com/cschome) brings plenty of vitality and good humor to their vintage retro-country/western setup, all topped off by Sills herself, whose crisp, rangy voice is the ideal icing on a sweet, sparkling cake.” – _Music Connection Magazine_

The Carolyn Sills Combo

  
Grounds open at 11:30 am and close at 4:00 pm. _**Bring your own picnic!**_ There will **not** be an on-site caterer on this day.
