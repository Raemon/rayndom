The Matt Finders Trio is a group of seasoned local musicians skillfully performing the American Songbook as well as more contemporary Latin and blues tunes. The group consists of Matt Finders on bass, John R Burr on keyboards, and Kelly Fasman on drums. The group has been performing together for nearly ten years. As a trombonist, Matt was a member of The Tonight Show With Jay Leno Band for 17 years. John R Burr toured for many years with Maria Muldaur and bluegrass legend, Allison Brown. Kelly Fasman worked with Kenny Loggins and Peter Cetera. Come out and enjoy!
