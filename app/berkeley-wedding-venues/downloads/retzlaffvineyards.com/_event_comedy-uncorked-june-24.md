# Comedy Uncorked – June 24

June 24, 2023  @  5:30 pm  –  10:00 pm 

June 24th kicks off our summer standup comedy series with headliner Mickey Joseph. This Las Vegas-based comedian is also a musician, writer, actor, artist, finalist in the prestigious San Francisco international comedy competition, and has been seen on _Abc’s America’s Funniest People_ and NBC’s _Friday Night Videos_. Joining Mickey are the phenomenally funny Carla Clay, Faith Alpher, and the multi-talented Chelsea Bearce. 

Grounds open at 5:30 pm / show starts at 7:30 pm. 

The Matt Finders and Friends band will provide the soundtrack before the show. A variety of food options will be offered by Tasteful Catering and Events, or you may bring in your own pre-show picnic. Winery permits do not allow outside alcohol to be consumed on the grounds, but wines by the bottle will be available for sale in the Retzlaff wine shop. 

Tickets are on sale now at [comedyuncorked.com](https://comedyuncorked.com). These shows always sell out, so get your tickets while available.

A portion of the proceeds benefits Open Heart Kitchen.
