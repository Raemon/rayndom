# Comedy Uncorked – Final Summer Show

September 15, 2023  @  5:30 pm  –  10:00 pm 

We’ve added a 4th show to our summer comedy series, FRIDAY September 15th with Bay Area comedy legend Johnny Steele. Joining Johnny are Pat McCoy and Sue Alfieri. Details are at [comedyuncorked.com](https://www.comedyuncorked.com). 

Grounds open at 5:30 pm / show starts at 7:30 pm. 

The Matt Finders and Friends band will provide the soundtrack before the show. A variety of food options will be offered by Tasteful Catering and Events, or you may bring in your own pre-show picnic. Wine by the bottle will be sold in the Retzlaff shop. Winery permits do not allow any outside alcohol to be consumed on the grounds. 

Tickets are on sale now at [comedyuncorked.com](https://comedyuncorked.com). These shows always sell out, so get your tickets while available.

A portion of the proceeds benefits Open Heart Kitchen, feeding the hungry of the Tri-Valley.
