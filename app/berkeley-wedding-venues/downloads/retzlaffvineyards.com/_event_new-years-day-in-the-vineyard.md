# New Year’s Day In the Vineyard

January 1, 2023  @  12:00 pm  –  3:00 pm 

Join us at the winery for some New Year’s cheer! No wine tasting this day, but the grounds are open for bottle sales and your own picnic.

[Reserve your spot](https://retzlaffvineyards.com/wine-tasting-and-picnicing/) for a table session on the lawn. 

**Special holiday hours are 12-3 pm.**

No on-site caterer this day, so feel free to bring your own snacks or lunch. The Retzlaff shop also has a selection of packaged snacks and non-alcoholic beverages available for purchase.
