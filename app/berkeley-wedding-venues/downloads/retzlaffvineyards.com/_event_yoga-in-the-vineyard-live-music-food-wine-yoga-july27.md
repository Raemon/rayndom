# Yoga in the Vineyard – Live Music, Food, Wine & Yoga

### Summer Sundown Yoga

Bring your mat and join us on the grass–There’s sun AND shade– at the beautiful family-owned Retzlaff Vineyards Winery. Yoga instructor Ruben Gonzalez teaches an All-Level, outdoor vinyasa flow class on the vineyard lawn.

Savor the vineyards, the hills, and an endless blue sky! It’s summer.
