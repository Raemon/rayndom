# Day After Thanksgiving, Friday – BYO Picnic!

November 25, 2022  @  12:00 pm  –  4:30 pm 

Relax the day after Thanksgiving on the Retzlaff grounds with live music from Dave “Ouzo” Land, and a bottle of wine. 

**This is a bring-your-own picnic food day!**

Got leftovers? Enter the Leftover Sandwich contest. The most creative sandwich as judged by our “experts” wins a bottle of Retzlaff wine. 

Reservations and wine bottle purchases are required for picnic table seating. Make your [reservations in advance now](https://retzlaffvineyards.com/wine-tasting-and-picnicing/). 

**Note:** Bottle sales only this day. Wine Tasting will resume on Saturday, Nov. 26.

## **Live Music with David Land**

“Ouzo” Dave Land performs on the Retzlaff stage with upbeat, acoustic classics and original tunes to make the afternoon merry.
