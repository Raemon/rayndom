# Live Music with Patrick & Leanne, with Special Guest Brian Skinner

### 

August 20, 2023  @  12:00 pm  –  4:30 pm 

Join us for wine tasting, or a wine picnic outdoors on the lovely Retzlaff picnic grounds, including live music with the Patrick and Leanne duo, and special guest Brian Skinner. Admission is only with a Wine Tasting or Picnic Table reservation. See our [Visit Us details](https://retzlaffvineyards.com/visit-us/).

## Patrick & Leanne, with Special Guest, Brian Skinner

Patrick Noel Russ and Leanne Phillips believe that life is good, and that music can be a vehicle to share positivity into the world. Performing as “Patrick and Leanne”, Patrick plays guitar and Leanne plays keyboards, and together they inspire smiles wherever they go. Their music is Celtic-tinged Americana, somewhere between Country and Folk. Patrick is a singer-songwriter and his latest music release, “My Hometown”, includes songs inspired by his hometown of Livermore, California. For more information, visit [www.theluckysevens.com](http://www.theluckysevens.com) (<http://www.theluckysevens.com/>)”. 

Joining Patrick and Leanne is guitarist Brian Skinner who regularly performs around the Livermore Valley and brings a bit of Country Bumpkin Funk and Blue Grass to the duo. He can be found @BrianSkinnerMusic.
