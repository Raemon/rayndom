# Why Your Perfect Offsite Meeting Venue Is Mavericks House

Companies understand that to help their work teams develop common goals and build creativity and collaboration, they need to spend focused time out of the office together on an offsite or retreat. As mentioned in [The Why, When, and How of Successful Retreats](https://www.just-works.com/img/Retreats_Ora_Grodsky_and_Jeremy_Phillips.pdf) from Just Works Consulting and Jeremy Phillips Consulting: “Retreats can build organizational muscle for strategic and creative thinking that can be carried back into daily work. A retreat can be an opportunity for taking stock, reflecting together, assessing and refining practice, and providing a turbo boost to specific aspects of work.”

**When it is time to plan your next offsite meeting or retreat, Mavericks House is the perfect venue.**

Here’s why:

**You can get into an entirely different environment, which sparks creativity.**

Mavericks Event Center is located just 30 miles south of San Francisco and 45 miles north of Silicon Valley, yet it feels worlds away. Situated on a dramatic oceanfront bluff in Half Moon Bay, your team members will be able to “drink in” the fresh ocean air from the expansive deck and adjacent garden. The town of Half Moon Bay is a charming community with a laid back lifestyle.

**Our meeting space is “right!” for maximum productivity.**

Mavericks House offers lots of natural light, scenic harbor vistas, indoor and outdoor social areas, and a variety of configurations to accommodate exactly what you have in mind. Check out our virtual tour [here](https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=im8skTTanHD). Our onsite catering features fresh, locally grown ingredients and sustainable seafood, providing the highest quality options.

**You can plan a variety of team building activities to build group cohesion.**

According to many team building experts, it’s important to plan activities during an offsite that will build a sense of interdependence and collaboration. Mavericks Event Center offers a variety of unique [team building activities](https://maverickseventcenter.com/corporate-events/team-building.html). Our fun and memorable cooking classes enable your group to prepare great food together, and then pair it with [Half Moon Bay Brewing Company](https://www.hmbbrewingco.com/) beers and ales. Your team can also take a short walk to the Half Moon Bay Brewing Company and learn the essentials of brewing handcrafted beer. Our onsite event staff can also arrange lawn games, kayaking, sailing, bike riding, hiking, a scavenger hunt, or something totally unique just for you.

**Half Moon Bay is a fun place to visit.**

With its historic downtown, shops, art galleries, restaurants, beaches, parks, golf courses, nurseries and farms, Half Moon Bay is a wonderful destination all by itself! It is located on the Pacific Coast between forested hills and some of the most beautiful coastlines that California has to offer.
