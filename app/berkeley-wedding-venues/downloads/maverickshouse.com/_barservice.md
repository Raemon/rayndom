## Bar Service Options 

HOST VS. NO-HOST 

You have the option of “hosting” your guests, in which you pay for all beverages consumed, or a “no-host” bar, where your guests can purchase their own drinks via credit card. Additional options include hosting the bar for a pre-selected dollar amount, preselected time period, or specific type of beverage, after which we can change over to a no-host bar for guests. Please note, no-host bars require a second bartender to ensure prompt service for your guests. All beverages served at the bar, including beer, wine, cocktails, sodas & juices are charged on consumption, host or no host. 

FULL BAR VS. SOFT BAR 

A full bar set-up includes four local craft beers, six wines, sparkling wine, and a variety of cocktails, as well as soft drinks, Pellegrino, and assorted juices to be charged per consumption. There is a minimum charge of $250 for a full bar set-up, where guests can choose from any of the above options, regardless of whether your event is “hosted”, or “no-host”. A soft bar setup is available and includes four local craft beers on tap, wines, sparkling wine, soft drinks, Pellegrino, and assorted juices.

WINE AND SPARKLING WINE 

We recommend selecting 6-8 wines from the list above. If you prefer to bring in your own wine there is a corkage fee of $25 per 750 mL bottle plus a $200 one time handling fee. Wine must be checked in with your Event Manager and must be pre-arranged.

TOASTS 

A passed sparkling wine toast is available for $6.00 per person (one glass per person) of our house sparkling wine. Wedding ceremony & reception packages includes passed sparkling wine at the conclusion of the ceremony. 

BARTENDER FEE 

When offering a bar, soft or full, a bartender fee of $75 per hour, per bartender applies. Each bartender requires a 4-hour minimum, guest counts above 100 require a second bartender.
