[Half Moon Bay Brewing Company](https://www.hmbbrewingco.com) announces Mavericks House, the premier waterfront venue located in Pillar Point Harbor. Formerly Mavericks Event Center, the new Mavericks House invokes the spirit of the original use as a boathouse and creates “a place to belong” atmosphere. Indoors, sustainable engineered wood flooring creates a charming scene with panoramic views of Pillar Point Harbor, just a stone throw away from the famous Mavericks surf spot. Outdoors, the new garden path and landscaping with privacy fencing on the bluffs above the harbor offer majestic views of the Pacific and marine wildlife. 

Mavericks House offers lots of natural light, scenic harbor vistas, indoor and outdoor social areas, and more! Our catering menu features fresh, locally grown ingredients and sustainable seafood. 

“The Mavericks House team invites you to relax and enjoy a meal and a beverage on our deck, indoor space, or garden with unobstructed views of our beautiful Northern CA coast. Our unique, one of a kind waterfront venue provides the perfect backdrop for your next event.” Melanie Hubbert, Director of Private Events.

Mavericks House creates the perfect setting for your team building retreat, wedding ceremony and celebration, or a dinner reception for 100 of your closest friends! We can’t wait to meet you!
