**Combine Your Offsite Meeting with Volunteering at Mavericks House**

Group volunteering is a great way to bring your work team closer together and do some good for the community as well. Mavericks House in Half Moon Bay would like to invite your company to plan your corporate retreat with us, and then incorporate giving back to the local community into your team building agenda. We have three exciting 501c3 that are doing great work and are either walking distance or close proximity to our event center. All of them would be thrilled to have your team contribute its expertise and time during your corporate offsite.

[Sea Hugger](http://www.seahugger.org/) combats marine plastic pollution and works to restore the health of the ocean by: encouraging people to stop using single-use plastic and providing alternatives, educating the public about the dangers of single-use-plastic (focusing on kids), and funding private recycling programs in coastal areas of the world with severe plastic pollution. The Sea Hugger corporate program includes beach cleanups and interactive workshops on how to reduce plastics. At Mavericks Event Center, we have been committed to using alternatives to plastic straws since early 2018. 

The [Surfrider Foundation](https://smc.surfrider.org/) is dedicated to the protection and enjoyment of the world’s ocean, waves and beaches through a powerful activist network. We are proud that Half Moon Bay Brewing Company was the first ocean friendly restaurant to be certified on the coast by Surfrider. _One of the activities your group can do, as part of your offsite, is help with a monthly beach cleanup along the San Mateo Coast._

[The HEAL project](https://www.thehealproject.org/groups)****(Health, Environment, Agriculture, Learning) helps 4,000 students each year learn where their food comes from and why it matters through its educational programs, including its hands-on outdoor learning, which inspires kids' natural curiosity and cultivates environmental awareness. _The HEAL project’s_[ _Group Volunteering Program_](https://www.thehealproject.org/groups) _offers your organization the opportunity to give back to the community while providing a meaningful, outdoor, team building experience, on its farm in El Granada._
