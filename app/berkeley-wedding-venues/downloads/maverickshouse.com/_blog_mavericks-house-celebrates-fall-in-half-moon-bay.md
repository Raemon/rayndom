**Fall Brews & Events at Half Moon Bay Brewing Company**

It’s Fall, one of our favorite times of year here at Mavericks House. The next few months are full of fun events and beer releases in Half Moon Bay and at our parent company, Half Moon Bay Brewing Company. They have their yearly fall beer, Pumpkin Harvest Ale, out now and events like Coastside BrewFest, Harvest Pumpkin Dinner, Día de los Muertos, and Pumpkin Festival!

**Fall Brew:**

_Available beginning September 16_

Half Moon Bay Brewing Company’s Brewmaster James Costa has crafted award-winning beers since arriving here at HMB BrewCo in 2013. This fall, they’ll re-release their fall signature beer:

o **Pumpkin Harvest Ale (released September 16th),** the full-bodied Amber Ale is made with locally grown Sugar Pie pumpkins that are roasted with a secret blend of spices added to the brew kettle, resulting in a subtle pumpkin pie spice flavor balanced by a biscuity maltiness. 6.3% ABV 

****

Pumpkin Harvest Ale will be available on tap and in 22 oz. bottles at Half Moon Bay Brewing Company, along with [retailers](https://www.hmbbrewingco.com/beer-finder) throughout the Bay Area.
