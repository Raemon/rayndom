Looking for a stunning waterfront location to host your corporate holiday party or family gathering? Mavericks House is situated on a dramatic bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Half Moon Bay.

Managed and operated by the Half Moon Bay Brewing Company, the award winning, locally owned brewery and restaurant located around the corner, Mavericks offers stunning views of Pillar Point Harbor. 

**Beautiful indoor and outdoor space**

Mavericks’ spacious ballroom is lined with windows facing the sea, providing a beautiful backdrop for your holiday photos. The outdoor deck and harbor view garden enable guests to simply pause for a moment and take in the ocean.

**Exciting holiday party activities**

Want to create a unique and exciting activity for your holiday party guests? How about a beer pairing and tapas? Or, a blind craft beer tasting, where you can learn all about beer from a master brewer. Or, an interactive holiday cooking class? Mavericks House offers all three and more. The event planning staff will work with you to create a truly one-of-a-kind event that your co-workers or family members will talk about for years to come.

**Menu featuring fresh, locally grown ingredients**

The menu at Mavericks House always features fresh, locally grown ingredients and sustainable seafood from the Half Moon Bay area. To ensure that the food for your holiday party is as unforgettable as the setting, Mavericks Executive Chef will work with you to create the perfect dining experience. Whether you are looking for passed appetizers, or a seated dinner, Mavericks can help you design a menu that will please everyone.

_“We held a holiday party at Mavericks House yesterday and it was fantastic! The service and the food were all spectacular and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to do an event at the beach. The wait staff and bartenders were all incredibly helpful as well, even helping me unload my car with all of our set-up supplies. Really wonderful experience!”_
