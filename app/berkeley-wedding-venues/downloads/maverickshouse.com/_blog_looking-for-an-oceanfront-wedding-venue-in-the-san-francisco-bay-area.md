_“We are beyond happy that we chose to get married at Mavericks House.”_

If your dream is to get married beside the Pacific Ocean, [Mavericks House ](https://maverickshouse.com/weddings.html)is one of the only truly oceanfront wedding venues in the San Francisco Bay Area. Named for the famed surf break right up the beach, Mavericks House sits on a wide bluff, just feet from the gentle surf. Combine its exceptional location, attentive staff, and on-site catering, and you have everything you need for a beautiful, stress-free wedding day. Numerous happy couples have held their ceremony at our beautiful ceremony site with an arch overlooking the water, and then moved to our indoor ballroom for their reception.

**We take care of the details, so you don’t have to**

We know that planning a wedding can be a bit overwhelming. That’s why we make everything about your ceremony and reception simple and easy for you. We provide an on-site event manager, who will be your single point of contact. Once we understand your vision, your budget, and how many guests you expect, we’ll work with you on the venue layout, your food menu, seating arrangements for your guests, linens and more.

We can also help with your floral arrangements, photographer, officiate and music. We have a trusted list of [preferred wedding vendors](https://maverickseventcenter.com/weddings/preferred-vendors.html) who have worked with us many times. Each of our preferred vendors knows the ins and outs of our venue - for example, where to find the best lighting for your wedding photos - and is committed to helping you have a perfect day!

**Exceptional food and beverages**

We offer a variety of menu options, from simple hors d'oeuvres, to a dinner buffet or full sit down dinner. We are proud to feature fresh, locally grown ingredients and sustainable seafood from the Half Moon Bay area. The chef at our award winning Half Moon Bay Brewery Restaurant, right next door, prepares everything just for you and your guests.

Before your special day, we invite you to come in for a complimentary menu tasting. You can sample beverages too, including our handcrafted brews and selection of wines.

On your wedding day, our staff is attentive to you and your guests’ needs. Our ultimate goal is that you enjoy everything about your wedding day, and everyone has a wonderful time.

_“We are beyond happy that we chose to get married at Mavericks House. Our goal was be able to enjoy the day, stress-free, and not get bogged down with details, and the venue and staff helped to make that happen. Mavericks is practically all-inclusive so we only had to work with one vendor for everything from room layout, to food and beverage, to linens, dinnerware, & staff! Plus, they provided a preferred vendor list for everything else we needed, including flowers, DJ, and photographer. It was so nice to have complete trust in our vendors and not have to worry about a thing._

_We received amazing compliments from our guests about everything; the beautiful outdoor ceremony on the water, the lawn games during cocktail hour, delicious food and beer from the Half Moon Bay Brewing Company, and more. We'd recommend Mavericks House to anyone looking for a beautiful setting at an affordable price!”_
