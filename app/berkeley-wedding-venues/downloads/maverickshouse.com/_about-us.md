Oceanfront Event Venue

# About Mavericks House

* * *

Mavericks House was originally built as a boathouse in the early 1980s in historic Princeton by the Sea. In 2009, Half Moon Bay Brewing Company took over and turned it into the beautiful oceanfront event space it is today. Mavericks House is named for the most famous big wave break on the continental US, Mavericks, which is just up the road from Mavericks House.

Now, Mavericks House is an oceanfront venue conveniently located between San Francisco and Silicon Valley – perfect for your wedding, business meeting, or special event. It sits on a large waterfront bluff with an indoor event space that can accommodate up to 140 guests, along with a spacious outdoor deck and harbor view garden.

Our event venue offers a dedicated private event team and a wide range of services and amenities, providing you with everything you need to make your day memorable. To ensure that the food is as unforgettable as the setting, our culinary team will work with you to create the perfect dining experience.
