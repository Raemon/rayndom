# What’s Happening in Half Moon Bay This Fall?

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cf6de85b6e2240001bd85c7/1566596317498-9LO930A0PXLKM4RQBH09/Half-Moon-Bay-Brewing-Co-Pumpkin-Beer.jpg)

Mention Half Moon Bay and fall in the same sentence, and most people immediately think of the Half Moon Bay Art and Pumpkin Festival. This increasingly popular event draws participants from the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as the rest of the world, for a weekend of nonstop pumpkin festivities.

What many people may not know, however, is that there is a lot more going on in Half Moon Bay throughout the fall season than just the Art and Pumpkin Festival. And, Half Moon Bay Brewing Company and Mavericks House are proud to be a part of it.

**Here is a snapshot of what is happening in Half Moon Bay this fall.** Each of these singular events is reason enough to come to the coastside for a day, or an entire weekend:

**October 8th - 7 a.m. Safeway World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Off** – This is the Super Bowl of pumpkin weigh-offs. Watch giant pumpkins be transported by forklift from local farmers’ trucks to the official scale for weighing. Weigh-off organizers are offering a top prize of $7 per pound and $30,000 in total prize money for a new world record. On the IDES Grounds, 735 Main Street, Half Moon Bay.

**October 10th - 6:00 p.m. Harvest Dinner at Mavericks House**. Half Moon Bay Brewing Company’s annual Harvest Dinner will feature produce exclusively from local “Farmer John” Muller, including: Butternut squash soup, local king salmon, and pumpkin cheesecake. Half Moon Bay Brewing’s brew master James Costa, will provide handcrafted beer. Purchase tickets [here](https://red.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?e=3f14d2400fb889cb56b5975df8e2c988&t=tix).

**October 13-14 - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Half Moon Bay Art & Pumpkin Festival.** The world-famous [Half Moon Bay Art & Pumpkin Festival](https://pumpkinfest.miramarevents.com/event-details/about-the-event.html) is the fall season’s signature event, drawing visitors to historic Main Street. This year’s event will be the community’s 48th annual festival. Half Moon Bay Brewing Company will be featuring our [Pumpkin Harvest Ale](https://pumpkinfest.miramarevents.com/festival-highlights/pumpkin-harvest-ale.html) (made with locally grown Sugar Pie pumpkins), Kolsch, and Full Swing IPA.

**October 27 – 7-10 p.m. Halloween Party.** Guests of all ages are welcome to enter Half Moon Bay Brewing Company’s annual costume contest.
