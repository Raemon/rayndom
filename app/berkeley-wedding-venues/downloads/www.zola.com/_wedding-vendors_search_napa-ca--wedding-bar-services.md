My venue had some very strict alcohol restrictions. Like only canned cocktails They worked with me every step of the way and elevated those canned cocktails so you couldn't even tell that it was cutwaters. They somehow made them taste so much better. They also worked with us to include custom artwork of our pets on cans of beer and cider. They even included that artwork in the custom menu they provided. They also surprised us with an adorable mirror decoration that made its way into a LOT of our photos(pictured below). They were also so nice. All my guests could talk about is how nice they were. They were so responsive every step of the way. My wedding planner said that Candace was the most responsive vendor she's ever worked with. Truly you HAVE to book Lushed and Loaded.”Colette H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/08f07a6a-0342-4c36-85c7-a644b824900d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/lushed-and-loaded)

Mixmuse 5.0

  * Starts at $500 
  * Serves Napa, CA

At Mixmuse, we believe drinks can be more than just drinks — they can be memories.🧸 I started behind the counter of a tea shop in New York, experimenting with flavors and learning how a simple sip could make someone smile. 🎀 Years later, Mixmuse was born to bring that feeling to weddings and celebrations. Every event we serve is personal — we arrive early, set the scene with décor from our travels, and craft each drink on-site with premium tea leaves, real juice, and organic ingredients. For us, it’s not just about serving drinks — it’s about creating moments your guests will always remember.🌊“Booking Mixmuse was one of the best choices we made. Amy and Jimmy brought not only amazing drinks but also a beautifully styled setup with décor from their travels. Every sip felt premium and personal, and our guests loved having boba as an option. It truly elevated the whole celebration.”Jeiane P., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/20c1b99a-610a-4438-b2ce-d0cd3d055470?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/mixmuse)

Every drink he helped us plan was a masterclass in drink artistry, our favorite being a smoky mezcal margarita which he individually infused with a miniature wood smoker. He worked with us to plan the cocktail recipes and enhanced our ideas with his professional experience, and provided a detailed shopping list that made the alcohol easy to source. We had plenty of champagne, wine and beer left over because everyone stuck with Paolo’s amazing drinks all night long, and his detailed focus meant his shopping list was exactly on par to have every drink all night and little unnecessary leftovers. He really helped our special night be truly seamless and amazing!”Alanna S., 8 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/pablito-the-bartender)
