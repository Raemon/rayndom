## About this venue

Located in the heart of Santa Rosa, is a rustic Italian winery filled with generations of passion and love. Often referred to as an urban "hidden gem" by their guests, their boutique winery offers a charming venue with three areas and an array of inclusive amenities. They specialize in weddings, welcome gatherings, and rehearsal dinners and cherish the magic created by couples who begin their "forever" inside their doors. They offer full catering by their on-site restaurant Cibo Rustico Pizzeria with a menu featuring wood-fired pizzas, pasta, salads, desserts, and specialty dishes. Their max capacity is 130 guests, however, groups of about 60 guests is an ideal size group for their space. There is room for dancing. You may bring in any venders you prefer including your DJ, florist, and photographer. Email Breanna at D’Argenzio Winery for a faster response.

  * ### July Wedding Reception

•Verified review

•Emma R.•Sep 15, 2024

We had the wedding reception of our dreams this July! We were drawn to having our 110-person reception at D'Argenzio Winery for countless reasons including great price and a truly beautiful location. Breanna had excellent, understanding, and flexible communication with us for the entire year leading up to our wedding day. We rented the Terrazzo Patio and Tasting Room Lounge and had open seating for the guests so that they could choose to sit inside or outside! Everyone enjoyed the wine, Prosecco, beer, and soft drink offerings at the bar. We absolutely loved Cibo Rustico's catering of antipasto boards, salads, pasta, and chicken offerings. We also had a banda perform late into the night on the bocce ball court following dinner, speeches, and the first dance! You too can have the wedding you always dreamed of at D'Argenzio Winery!

  * ### Amazing
