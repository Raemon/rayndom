## Trending **questions** from our couples

We love all of your questions. Seriously! It's okay to ask…

**Q:**  
Are cash gifts tacky?  
  
**Team-Z:**  
Absolutely not! We find that when couples create specific cash gifts, their guests treat it like a gift and love to give them that experience.

**Q:**  
Do I need to invite my coworkers to my wedding?  
  
**Team-Z:**  
If you want them to be there, and have it in your budget, awesome! But it's not expected unless you're really good friends with them.

**Q:**  
We're a week out — what are we forgetting?  
  
**Team-Z:**  
Have you packed a day-of emergency kit? How about the final details of who is setting up any signage? Finalize tips and payments for vendors — prep those envelopes! Make sure you have the rings!

### What's your favorite moment at a wedding?

I love the moment when the partners see each other for the first time, especially if it's as one is walking down the aisle. Seeing photos of my husband's emotions as I walked down the aisle is something I'll treasure forever.
