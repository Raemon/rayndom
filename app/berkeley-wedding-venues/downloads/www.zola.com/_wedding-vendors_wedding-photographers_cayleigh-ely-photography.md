I love mexican food, cats (and dogs!), and iced coffee. Books are my best friends, and I also double as a yoga teacher when I'm not doing photography related things. I have a weird obsession with fuzzy socks and I prefer movies over TV shows. Now on to the typical things you want to know about my journey in photography...I got my first camera in 2009 and basically haven't put it down since! I studied photography at Savannah College of Art and Design and started my freelance photography career when I graduated in 2016!

You can say that every photographer loves to capture the best moments of your lives, and I believe that to be true...but what sets us apart is how we do it. I know that planning a wedding is super exciting but can also be really stressful, so I'm here to help ease some of the stress by not just showing up on your wedding day to photograph you in your beautiful wedding attire with all of your loved ones, but also be around for the planning process to help develop timelines, provide recommendations, and make sure you have the BEST DAY EVER with your partner!

  * ### Bride

•Verified review

•Morgan L.•Nov 7, 2023

If I had to describe Cayleigh in one word, it would be fantastic! When I was look for a photographer I really wanted someone who would mesh well with my husband as he is not very photogenic, or should I say camera shy. Cayleigh worked very well with him and got him to come out of his shell! We did and Engagement shoot, 10 hours for our wedding, and will be doing some maternity photos here in a couple months as well! If you are looking for someone who is friendly, and gets creative with any type of person she is your girl!

She is the most talented and down-to-earth photographer and person! She was a breeze to work with and I never had a worry about her. She delivered the best pictures and her style fit mine perfectly! I am so so so happy we went with her and now my husband and I have our photographer for life!

•Luana•Sep 20, 2021

We highly recommend Cayleigh Ely Photography after working with her here at our wedding venue at Hidden Creek Farm Weddings and Events. Cayleigh is a sweetheart and works with our brides and grooms and their families to capture some of the most special moments in their lives. Her photography is amazing and her demeanor so professional. You won’t be disappointed with her work and will enjoy having her by your side on your wedding day.

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you also offer video services?

I do not offer video services, however, I work with a handful of videographers in the wedding industry and can help you find the right one for your big day if you book with me.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 100 to 150 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 12 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.
