The space itself was truly breathtaking, with its amazing new upgrades and beautiful views. However, there were a few details that weren't properly communicated to us, which led to a bit of a rocky start. Although my bridal party and I had lots to deal with prior to ceremony start, these issues were not something our guests would have seen/noticed. To their credit, the Wedgewood team acknowledged their mistakes and upgraded our bar package to make up for it. Overall, the venue was beautiful and the staff did their best to ensure our day went smoothly, despite the initial hiccups. We would recommend San Ramon Waters to other couples looking for a gorgeous wedding location.”Gabriella G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/09e08c08-a991-4f46-8f27-5f0c08b2944c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/san-ramon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

The whole JSM team was so amazing to work with and made planning as stress-free as possible. We stuck to the planning timeline they provided in the planning binder (which was SO helpful to have) and had everything ready in time. Our guests all raved about what a fabulous wedding it was. We customized the venue quite a bit bringing in our own decor and personal touches and it did not feel cookie-cutter at all even though it is an all-inclusive venue. I am so happy we chose JSM!! The recommended vendors were all outstanding, the food was delicious, everything ran smoothly during the wedding and I didn't have to stress about a thing. The mansion, ceremony area, and reception tent are all BEAUTIFUL. I could not have asked for a more perfect day.”Alexandra H., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/1cb206fc-f347-4815-84a4-94dca8dc013d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/jefferson-street-mansion-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“We loved working with our Hacienda De Las Flores team for our wedding! Johnny was our day of coordinator wand was wonderful. With our schedules being so busy we could not imagine planning this wedding without the WW team which for us took care of most things for us (food, decor, drinks, DJ). We appreciated the planning materials, binder, meetings which helped keep us on track. As my sister joked even if we did nothing, the wedding would still be great! We went with the recommended florist (A love is in bloom) and bakery (Old towne danville) and thought both were wonderful. We did chose our own Officiant and Photographer however. The venue is gorgeous and the weather thankfully cooperated for a beautiful early fall day. They were great about working with us and our decor ideas and playlist ideas. We loved our wedding! The only downside to be aware of is the noise ordinance which prevents use of microphones in the outdoor patio during reception (only pre-recorded sound/speech is ok). this was not ideal but we knew this was the case when we booked the venue because it is that gorgeous. We did speeches indoors in the dance hall which worked out fine though not ideal. We also had a tiny sound mishap during our grand entrance due to the pre-recorded nature of things but overall not a big deal. Overall think this venue is awesome and would recommend though of course depends on what's most important to you!”Vira F., 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/hacienda-de-las-flores-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“The Terrace Room was the perfect venue for our wedding day. From the very beginning, the staff, especially Candi and Bryon, were friendly, simple, quick, and incredibly helpful in planning our wedding all the way from Paris. They gave us great tips on vendors that really helped make our day magical. The venue itself is beautiful, with a lovely art deco style that felt elegant and unique. Our guests raved about the gorgeous space, the friendly staff (bar tenders, ...), and how well everything came together to make our wedding day truly perfect.

We wanted something unique that also aligned with our interests -- our background in physics, astronomy, and space. The staff at Chabot are incredibly kind and were quick to respond to our emails and questions. The space was incredibly expansive and unique for our guests. The planetarium ceremony was our favorite part, and we will treasure those memories forever.

For starters Angela Muse helped us from start to finish on planning our day and every little detail in between! She was amazing to work with, she was clear, communicative, friendly and organized which is everything you want when you are planning your wedding! When I arrived at my reception I was blown away by the decor and how beautiful every detail was! Thank you so much Angela for all of your hard work and support in making my dream reception!!! The vendors that are connected to Fairview that I opted into having was DJ Keel and Ting at Montclair Florist. DJ Keel was a phenomenal MC and met with us ahead of time to get an idea of how we wanted our wedding MC'd as well as what we wanted our music to be like and let me tell you he achieved it!!! My guests were laughing, entertained and raving about the music all night! Thank you Dj Keel! I coordinated with Ting from Montclair Florist and although we did not talk much I have to say my bouquet and center pieces were the most beautiful flower arrangements I have ever seen! The flowers were stunning and she ran with the ideas I had and made it the most beautiful arrangement ever!! My guests were raving about the food and we were so supported by KeeKee our Banquet Manager! She checked in on us and made sure we were good throughout our reception! Book with Fairview you will not regret it the venue is beautiful and open, the tented pavilion is gorgeous, the food is delicious and the staff are phenomenal!!! Thank you Fairview for making the reception of my dreams!!!!”Tara W., 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/976fb9bd-0df6-4777-8d32-8494e7e817b2?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fairview-metropolitan)

Andrea and Sally are the most attentive, responsive, professional, and kind venue coordinators out there. Our wedding was a beautiful success because of them and the SCC staff. They know how to host a wedding -- and it shows. We valued their expertise every step of the way. They've hosted so many weddings that they had great suggestions and solutions to every single thing that came up. Their recommended vendors list is valuable and we used it to hire our great day of coordinator. The venue is beautiful and well cared for inside and out. It shows in our pictures. All of the chairs, linens, glassware, cake stands, etc. were in great condition. The building and grounds are lovely so we didn't need excessive decorations or flowers. We don't live locally and planned the wedding from across the country -- it wasn't an issue with how well organized SCC is. It rained the night before our wedding and was unexpectedly a little colder than we anticipated -- Andrea and Sally helped us adjust our day of plans-- we kept the ceremony outside but moved cocktail hour inside with only a couple hour notice -- no one was stressed, they took care of it all. We had 150 people for an outdoor ceremony and indoor dinner and dancing. Lastly -- we were very happy with the pricing (so many things are included, and if they aren't already included, they're happy to arrange just about anything else!). We felt every single dollar was well spent. We can't recommend the venue enough -- the biggest thank you to Andrea, Sally, and the SCC staff.”Merril & D., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/sequoyah-country-club)
