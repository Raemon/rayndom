Marlon and the team absolutely brought the vibes and all of our guests won't stop talking about them. Before our wedding day, Marlon was super attentive, responsive, and overall fun to work with. He really went out of his way to ensure our entire day went exactly as we envisioned. The energy of the live band combined with the well-mixed playlist certainly kept people entertained the whole party, and the dance floor stayed packed the entire night. We can not think of one thing that Golden Bell could have done better. They have our highest recommendation.”Audrey, 19 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/9041d898-59bf-4221-b17e-164891df1240?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/golden-bell-music)

They were timely, professional and were dressed up in a suit for our wedding. They include a logo of our name with a design they can add to the front of their both. It made our wedding set up look extra put together. They have an easy to use app so you can choose the music you want. You can even add more friends and family on the app so they can add music too. They go above and beyond too. James was able to remove the vocals on a song so that the live singer could use it to sing our first dance song. The most important part, they had the best music going continuously at the right times. The dance floor was full at my wedding the entire time even though the AC stopped working in the hall and it was really hot in there. After my reception, everyone wanted to keep dancing, they didn’t want to stop! The DJ James, made the reception so much fun. My friends and family still talk about how much fun they had at our wedding! I would hire them again in a heartbeat, and will use them for my events in the future!”Daniela C., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/533fd1a4-5f9b-41d3-81e2-bad9b4d4da41?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/precise-blend)

  * DJ
  * Serves Napa, CA

DM me on instagram or facebook, I don't respond to inquiries from here. I started DJ’ing as a kid with two boom boxes, cassette mixtapes, and a deep love for music. I got into Turntablism and DJ’ing as an art form after completing a term in the Air Force. That's when I expanded my love for music and worked my way through college DJ’ing and doing voiceover. At Cal State I earned a B.A. in Film & Audio Production, and I then went on to become a certified Audio Engineer. When it comes to DJing for private events/venues like club rentals, weddings, corporate parties etc, I love my clients, and thrive on making meaningful connections.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/dj-wayne-noel)

While Second Song made the process leading up to the wedding easy and seamless (and the cold sparklers were a hit), DJ Tyler did an amazing job at my wedding and absolutely CRUSHED the dance floor. My husband and I have differing music tastes, but DJ Tyler was able to find common ground and played banger after banger that kept all of our guests on the dance floor till the very end. As someone who goes to music festivals often, I was impressed by his mixing skills and appreciated that there was never an abrupt transition between songs. He also did an amazing job MC’ing and executed all of our requests for playing specific songs at certain times and starting songs in the middle. I don’t think you can go wrong with any DJ’s with Second Song, but I do highly recommend picking DJ Tyler O!”Shirley Y., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/b474ba32-010b-4e06-9da4-3fae65e627d9?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/second-song)

He listened to our music needs, which were not the clearest at times, but nonetheless he came up with a great playlist that fit the diverse age range and what we were envisioning. It seemed that all the guests were dancing on the dance floor at some point in the evening. Just recently a guest from the wedding reached out commenting how Conner was the best wedding DJ they have ever heard. Conner brings a cool, sophisticated vibe that is truly great for all age demographics. Additionally, Conner was super professional, on time, and had state of the art sound equipment. He also did an incredible job micing the night and keeping the pace. The fact that I didn't want the night to end speaks volumes to how much I enjoyed our wedding and a big part of that was the music. Hiring the right DJ is one of the best wedding decisions we made and was also way more cost effective than a live band. To wrap this up, we are so thankful Conner decided to take his DJ talents to the wedding industry. I am sure his business will take off. Thank you Conner, we will always remember how you made our night so special and my brother's EPIC speech :)”Rebecca P., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/5ffb90f5-2ddd-4b94-86fa-91524ab4c76d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/the-lovetap)

I’ve been playing weddings for over twelve years and I love my work! My services cover any or all aspects of wedding & receptions. I have found my life’s artistic calling in becoming flexible to every type of music my clients could desire. I learn to enjoy whatever my clients love and this resonance makes my job sustainable and ever-enjoyable. But, I do tend to request the ability to make choices for the dance-floor that rely on my years of dance-enhancing experience. I meet with my clients to determine what music they would love to hear and what music they do NOT want to hear.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Brandon and his team did a fantastic job! Despite the cold weather, my wife and I and our friends and family had an awesome time. We enjoyed the sound from our wireless mics, the pacing of the dinner music, the props and funny pics from the photo booth, and the energy on the dance floor. We almost didn’t get the Photo Booth, but we added it in last minute and we're glad we did. Highly recommend Brandon and his team.

Leading up to the wedding, she was super helpful in guiding us through the steps to set up playlists and coordinate the intros/outros of the bridal party. Our wedding was spread out over a large property, and she had zero issue running speakers to each area, providing a festive, cozy atmosphere! We had a couple live performances and she was very accommodating in getting mic stands and cables all ready to go. Then the DANCING began! Lights, speakers, the whole deal - Ashley killed it! We leaned into more 70’s and 80’s music, and Ashley completely understood the assignment. Needless to say, the music mix was brilliant. Since then, we have had at least a dozen of our friends and family tell us that this was the most fun they have ever had at a wedding. I have no doubt that Ashley is 99.99% responsible for that. Hiring Ashley and Fog City Entertainment made a lot of sense 6 months ago, but now, having seen what she can do for a wedding’s atmosphere and dance floor, it’s a no-brainer. Thank you, Ashley!!”Noah T., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/dab9e9d3-d307-4289-ba3e-9fd10977a475?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/fog-city-entertainment)
