In 2005, proprietors Ken & Julie Warwick and Nigel Lythgoe began the pursuit of turning their long-held dream of owning a vineyard into a reality. Once childhood friends in the backstreets of Liverpool, the Emmy-winning pair would grow up to produce the primetime hit, American Idol. It was during their time on Idol, travelling between audition cities, that they first discovered Paso Robles, a wine region still under the radar. Not long after consulting with their families, Ken and Nigel purchased and began redevelopment of an old-vine property located at the northern edge of the Paso Robles AVA. Over ten years later, Villa San-Juliette has emerged as a premier wine destination on the Central Coast.Why you'll love this venue

Four Sisters Ranch Vineyards & Winery San Miguel, CA

  * Select services
  * Indoor & outdoor
  * Starts at $3,000 

Since 1989, we've been driven by a passion for cultivating premium wine grapes. What started with producing bulk and private-label wines for prestigious wineries across Napa, Sonoma, Paso Robles, Texas, and beyond, evolved into a proud moment in 2007 when we released our own label—debuting with our acclaimed 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah! Since then, our wines have earned multiple awards and rave reviews. In 2015, Four Sisters Ranch expanded its horizons, introducing a stunning tasting room, a picturesque wedding and event venue, and a collection of exclusive, hand-crafted, small-batch Paso Robles wines. As medical doctors and vintners, we're also committed to promoting the antioxidant health benefits of moderate wine enjoyment. Dr. Serena Friedman has shared this expertise on international stages, including the Hong Kong International Wine & Spirits Fair and the Yantai International Wine Exposition, keeping us at the forefront of wine and wellness.Why you'll love this venue

“This venue brought our wedding to life with the sweeping views and nothing but rolling hills as far as the eye could see. We had great locations across the property picked out for photos which was very important to us as we didn't get any engagement photos.

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We recently had our wedding at Suisun Valley Inn, and overall, it was a beautiful and memorable experience. One of the biggest highlights was being able to use the venue for three full days, which gave us extra time to relax and connect with our bridal party and loved ones. That extended access truly made a difference in how special the weekend felt. However, there were a few challenges that did impact our plans. The event barn, which was a key part of our original vision, was unfortunately not finished in time for our wedding. While we understand this was out of the owner’s control, we were disappointed that we were not refunded the full 2,000 deposit, especially since the change affected nearly every aspect of our day. Additionally, when we arrived, we were surprised to find the vineyard had been plowed without any prior notice. This forced another last-minute adjustment to our setup so we wouldn’t be facing a dirt lot. It would have been really helpful to have been told about that in advance. Despite these hiccups, the venue itself has so much potential and charm, and we did have a lovely wedding. I just hope some of these experiences can help future couples plan better or spark a few improvements from the venue for the future.”Analisa R., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/024bd0c3-3769-4479-be04-a31009a3418e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

“The pricing on here is wrong. The venue fee alone is almost 30k. Then the food and beverage minimum is 50k but if you have 150 guests you will spend more like 80k. Plus there is a service fee of at least 13k. So BEFORE photographer, footwear, videographer, band, decor etc. you’re already at around 123k.”Jane, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/stanly-ranch)

“Our wedding was going to be on the smaller side but I still wanted it to be more special than just taking place in a hotel conference room. This was a completely DIY wedding, which I was personally funding, and I was doing my best to keep costs under control without compromising quality. After doing countless hours of research online about weddings and venues, it seemed everything would come with a huge price tag - far beyond my budget. I was worried that the challenges I was facing would be insurmountable and I'd have to settle for less than what I'd dreamed of. I knew I wanted to hold it at a winery, preferably one with beautiful views and perhaps a water feature. Clarksburg, being only 15 minutes from my house, was the region I wanted to explore. After visiting two other wineries in the area - one of which had a less than ideal location and poor customer service, and the other that was nice but WAY out of my price range for a 60-person guestlist - my final visit was to Julietta Winery. One of the owners, Julie, gave us the tour and we were immediately grateful for her attentiveness and input. When she showed us the back barn by the slough, I knew this could be the perfect venue! It was private, had separate but adjacent areas for the ceremony, cocktail hour and reception, plenty of nearby private parking, loads of charm, and was absolutely gorgeous. It was somewhat of a blank slate, but had special features like chandeliers in the barn and fountains throughout the grounds, and with a few added touches it could certainly be a creative bride's dream. Her suggestions, examples and expertise solidified that conclusion. After seeing the private ceremony site, the reception area and the bridal suite, we were invited back to the main building for a tasting. Unlike the other venues we had visited, all of the wines were equally delicious, further settling the decision to get married there. I even joined the wine club that day. Another thing that set Julietta Winery apart was that they allowed me to bring in my own vendors. A lot of places won't do this. Since I was putting 100% of my effort into making this a wonderful event, it was helpful to have this leeway and I was able to choose my DJ, musicians, photographer, "day of coordinator", transportation, baker and caterer. Julie and her staff were so accommodating, and Julie even took on the task of being an additional "day of" coordinator and "calmer of nerves". The wedding turned out to be everything I could have hoped for and more, and every single guest was amazed by the beautiful venue, the quality wine and the service received. It was perfect in every single way. I just wish I could share pictures with this review. We're so grateful to Julietta Winery!”Staci and M., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/julietta-winery)

“My wife and I held our wedding at Landmark in August 2024. Olivia was great to work with and the wedding itself was perfect and went off without a hitch. We loved the landscaping and ambiance of the venue, with its views of vineyards overlooking the Mayacamas, which provided the perfect backdrop for our 50 person ceremony. The beautiful flowers and outdoor furniture also helped us save a bit on other parts of our budget -- the space is so nice that it doesn't need too much done to it. We also liked the cottage and suite onsite, which are a nice perk. Landmark is definitely worth visiting if you are looking for a fantastic wine country venue!”Jay T., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/e69d0230-d260-4141-ad8a-a286b8b504df?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/landmark-vineyards)

“Farmstead at Long Meadow Ranch was the perfect venue for our intimate, 17-person, post-ceremony wedding lunch. We had the outdoor patio area all to ourselves and it was absolutely gorgeous, and so well-maintained! From the moment we reached out to Farmstead, the team was detailed, polite, and positive in their communication, making the planning process as seamless as could be expected. Farmstead was also really flexible in allowing us to bring our own decorations, which was so great, and truly helped our vision come to life. The food and drinks were fresh and absolutely delicious! It made all the difference to us that Farmstead was able to nimbly accommodate all of our guests' dietary preferences in a way that ensured people ate healthily and deliciously, especially for those who traveled from far away. We are so grateful to the Farmstead team for helping make our special day unforgettable.

“The Gables Wine Country Inn was the perfect venue for our wedding. It had an intimate vibe and had such a variety of beautiful atmospheric additions too such as: a charming historic barn, redwood trees, winery, and Victorian building in the backdrop, it couldn't have been better. Pam & Larry (the owners and managers of Gables Wine Country Inn) were so kind when we came to them for a last minute wedding and were so flexible and adaptable with the things we wanted for our wedding. They were extremely helpful in giving us our perfect day: the decor was gorgeous, the venue amazing, food & drink was the best and our guests had a great time too. It was a very easy planning process and they were very easy going about our wishes so I highly recommend this venue for a wedding, it was a wonderful experience and they couldn't have made the stress of planning a wedding any easier. It was a beautiful day and we have wonderful memories and photos of it forever, I couldn't be happier with it!”Holly and J., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-gables-wine-country-inn)

## About wedding venues in San Miguel, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530
  * 300 guests: $104,224



### Which California Venues Are Fully Accessible?

The Griffith House features wheelchair-accessible pathways throughout its Spanish-style grounds including the private ceremony lawn and separate preparation spaces for couples. You might also consider Holman Ranch Sunstone Winery and Villa del Sol d'Oro though you'll want to directly confirm their specific accessibility features when you visit. Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.

### Where Can You Find Exceptional Culinary Experiences in California?

La Valencia Hotel in La Jolla delivers impeccable service with menu options from lobster bisque to perfectly prepared steak. You'll love Vibiana in Los Angeles with its chef-driven menus served in a stunning restored cathedral setting. Rosewood Sand Hill in Menlo Park offers Michelin-star fine dining while Bali Hai Restaurant serves authentic Polynesian cuisine with breathtaking views overlooking San Diego Bay. California's culinary scene truly elevates the wedding experience.
