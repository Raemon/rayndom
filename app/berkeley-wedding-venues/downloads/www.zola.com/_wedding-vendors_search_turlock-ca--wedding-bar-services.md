The Tipsy Hellcat was born from my love of creating experiences that feel fun, personal, and totally on-vibe. I’m a mobile dry-hire bartender who specializes in crafting custom menus, thoughtful details, and bar setups that match your wedding’s unique style — whether you’re planning something elegant, alternative, whimsical, or bold. I’m passionate about making the process easy, stress-free, and exciting for couples. Your bar should feel like you, and I love helping bring that vision to life with creativity, warmth, and a little bit of Hellcat magic.“I’ve seen this business in action multiple times, including when she pre-batched all the cocktails for her own wedding, and it was honestly impressive. Everything was organized, clean, and so thoughtfully prepared. The drinks were delicious, consistent, and beautifully presented — not something you can always say about batch cocktails! She communicates clearly, stays professional, and brings such a calm, confident presence to any event. I’d absolutely trust her with wedding-day beverages.”Heather S., 2 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/the-tipsy-hellcat)

They helped make our personalized coffee wedding favors on top of having a variety of drinks for people to enjoy. As non drinkers, it was so awesome having them as an option at our wedding. They also were super collaborative and open to helping us make our affogato bar come true. They were quick communicators. They made delicious coffee (I had three lattes at my wedding plus an affogato). They were so kind to everyone and also added to a positive wedding vibe. Their set up was efficient and organized. They were helping with areas beyond our expectations as well at the wedding (clean-up!) I highly recommend them.

Mixmuse 5.0

  * Starts at $500 
  * Serves Turlock, CA

At Mixmuse, we believe drinks can be more than just drinks — they can be memories.🧸 I started behind the counter of a tea shop in New York, experimenting with flavors and learning how a simple sip could make someone smile. 🎀 Years later, Mixmuse was born to bring that feeling to weddings and celebrations. Every event we serve is personal — we arrive early, set the scene with décor from our travels, and craft each drink on-site with premium tea leaves, real juice, and organic ingredients. For us, it’s not just about serving drinks — it’s about creating moments your guests will always remember.🌊“Mixmuse is the kind of vendor that truly brings happiness to a wedding. The drinks were phenomenal — you could immediately tell they don’t use syrup but instead real juice and high-quality tea. At the tasting, Amy explained everything to us, and honestly I couldn’t even pick a favorite because they were all so good. On the wedding day, our guests were blown away and kept coming back for more. The table setup was also stunning, filled with unique decorations that Amy and Jimmy collected from their travels. I would 100% recommend them to any couple wanting drinks that make the celebration feel extra special!!!!”Jin, 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/ee8f47ad-d121-4de7-83fc-2fd75100d6e3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/mixmuse)

Barfly SJ 5.0

  * Starts at $250 
  * Serves Turlock, CA

Hello! My name is John and I've been in the hospitality / bar service industry for over 15 years. Let's talk about what you envision for your wedding day and I'll help create a custom package that fits your needs!“I can’t recommend Barfly enough for your wedding! They absolutely crushed it and made our day even more special by the custom touches included. From the get-go John was quick to respond, super organized, and made everything so easy. Other vendors we had on our day said John was fantastic to work with as well. He was friendly, fun, and kept the drinks flowing all night. My wife and I had our signature drinks in mind we wanted for our bar before meeting John, but he gave us tastes of his signature cocktails before we decided, and we ended up going with his craft cocktail menu. It was awesome to try samples beforehand and we didn't find any other bar offering this when inquiring. We really liked the bar setup itself as well and it really fit in with our look we wanted - simple, elegant, and custom touches of our own design like the menus on display. Overall, this service was a total game-changer for our wedding. If you’re looking for a mobile bar that’s easy to work with, fun, and makes your day even more memorable, I highly recommend Barfly!”Alicia M., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/barfly-sj)

Sunny Cups Coffee exists because we got married :) While planning our own wedding, we realized just how much heart goes into every single detail. Around that same time, we faced a choice many couples do. Do we buy a house or build something together? We chose to build a dream. We combined our love for coffee and planning and created this little business from the ground up. Because we have been in your shoes, we truly get how meaningful every decision feels. We are here to make this part of your day easy, beautiful, and something you can actually enjoy.“Sunny Cups Coffee was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. They were very responsive, getting back to us within 15 minutes of our initial inquiry. Their team went above and beyond what we asked, designing a custom beverage menu featuring our favorite drinks. The presentation of the coffee cart was lovely and matched the modern, clean theme of our wedding perfectly. We didn't have to worry about a thing! They basically did everything for us, and their setup was incredibly well made. We're so grateful for their attentive service and for helping to make our special day even more memorable.”Victoria C., 10 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/ca158044-f89b-4641-9315-6f2d1bc064a8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/sunny-cups-coffee)

We served beer, wine and two signature cocktails created by BT and everyone loved their energy and professionalism. There was a little communication issue along the way, but BT worked overtime to fix the error. They knew that our wedding was going to have a lot of Pinoy influences, and they decked out in Barongs and came up with Filipino-inspired cocktails which were very much loved. Thank you so much for making our day extra special. Salamat po!!!”Niki W., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/blind-tiger-cocktails-private-events)

I have done the same setup with multiple mobile bar services and it is never any easy task to pull this off and to do it well. Parched Poppies was a refreshing surprise and absolutely killed it for setup, professional bar service, amazing and delicious cocktails, keeping the guests hydrated without lines and being an amazing vendor to communicate and work with from start to finish! All the things I hope and wish for my clients when hiring a mobile bar service! Parched Poppies set the bar standard high for professional mobile bar services and all the packages and add-ons they offer.

Tipsy Elephant 5.0

  * Starts at $400 
  * Serves Turlock, CA for additional fees

When it comes to curating an unforgettable private event, your choice of bartender defines the experience. At Tipsy Elephant, you’re not just hiring a bartender — you’re securing a craftsman, entertainer, and mixology expert with a passion for both cocktail artistry and third-wave coffee fusion. Every drink is a sensory masterpiece, tailored to your event and designed to leave a lasting impression.“Hiring Mykola for our joint-bachelor party was the highlight of the week! He was extremely easy to work with from our initial consultation to the final farewell cheers. Our party was filled with low-key cocktail snobs, so we wanted to make sure we requested unique cocktails that we could not make ourselves. After a few revisions and recommendations from Mykola, we settled on our final menu, and the drinks exceeded our expectations. Our favorite was the Mezcal Verde! When Mykola arrived, he set up his portable bartending booth, the syrups and garnishes, and even displayed a cute personal menu of our four cocktails. Mykola’s drinks were so tasty that our bachelor party could not concentrate on the Murder Mystery game we had prepared. I still have no idea who the murderer was... Thank you, Mykola, for being the perfect bartender and addition to our celebration week! I will definitely hire you if I get married again!”Randall G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/30050038-9a9e-4bee-8277-04f21ce820aa?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/tipsy-elephant)
