![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We recently had our wedding at Suisun Valley Inn, and overall, it was a beautiful and memorable experience. One of the biggest highlights was being able to use the venue for three full days, which gave us extra time to relax and connect with our bridal party and loved ones. That extended access truly made a difference in how special the weekend felt. However, there were a few challenges that did impact our plans. The event barn, which was a key part of our original vision, was unfortunately not finished in time for our wedding. While we understand this was out of the owner’s control, we were disappointed that we were not refunded the full 2,000 deposit, especially since the change affected nearly every aspect of our day. Additionally, when we arrived, we were surprised to find the vineyard had been plowed without any prior notice. This forced another last-minute adjustment to our setup so we wouldn’t be facing a dirt lot. It would have been really helpful to have been told about that in advance. Despite these hiccups, the venue itself has so much potential and charm, and we did have a lovely wedding. I just hope some of these experiences can help future couples plan better or spark a few improvements from the venue for the future.”Analisa R., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/024bd0c3-3769-4479-be04-a31009a3418e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

“Having our wedding at The San Francisco Theological Seminary was one of the easiest and best decisions we made when planning for our wedding! As soon as we stepped foot on the campus, we knew it was the venue we’d been looking for. Working with the staff here (big thank you to Jeremiah Jenkins!!) was low stress and straightforward. Many other venues we looked at just didn’t feel right and felt overly complicated. The grounds were beautifully rich with history and architecture and more than we could have asked for in a wedding venue.”Heather H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/bb5b98cb-d8fa-4d6a-8fec-561973d2b369?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/university-of-redlands-marin-campus)

## About wedding venues in San Rafael, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:
