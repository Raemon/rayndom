  * ### Polished, Thoughtful, Wedding Day Videographer

•Verified review

•Ally K.•Jan 9, 2025

We used Brandon as our wedding videographer in October 2024 and I cannot say enough positive things about our experience. He was attentive, professional, and creative. Our venue's livestream equipment malfunctioned moments before our ceremony began, yet we had no idea because Brandon quickly jumped into action and saved the day. We found working with him to be incredibly stress-free. I would recommend him in a heartbeat.

  * ### Brandon was an essential part of the big day!

•Verified review

•Truly Loved Events•Jul 17, 2023

Brandon was an exceptional wedding videographer that captured the magic of the grooms' special day. His talent and dedication resulted in a breathtaking video that beautifully encapsulated the emotions and essence of the grooms' wedding ceremony and reception. His ability to blend in seamlessly and attention to detail truly set him apart. Our team loved Brandon’s professionalism and fun disposition, which really helped capture the memories. Highly recommended for his ability to create cinematic memories that will be treasured for a lifetime.
