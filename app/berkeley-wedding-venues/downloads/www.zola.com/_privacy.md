### **I. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

"Personal Information" is any information that relates to or can be used to identify you. The categories of Personal Information we collect depend on how you interact with us and our Services, as well as the requirements of applicable law. For example, we may collect different information from you depending on which of our Services you use (e.g., our registry services, personalized website and planning services, invitation, digital stationery and paper product services, Vendor Marketplace, inspirational content platforms or Community) or the capacity in which you use our Services or visit our Website. We collect Personal Information from the sources described below.

**Information You Provide to Us.** We collect information when you provide it to us directly, such as when you register for an account, place an order, submit photos, videos, comments, posts or other content to our Website or in connection with the use of our Services, engage with Vendors, participate in a sweepstakes or promotion, contact our customer support team or otherwise communicate with us. This may include information about yourself or about others (such as your partner and/or guests). By providing us with the Personal Information of another person, you represent that you have obtained permission from such person to share such information with us and for us to use such information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. The types of Personal Information we may collect directly from you include:

  * Contact information, such as your name, your partner's name, email address, postal address (including billing and shipping addresses) and phone number;

  * Payment information, such as your payment type, bank account number, credit or debit card number, verification number and expiration date;

  * Registry details, such as your preferences about your registry and style; items you've added to your registry, personal notes you've added to any items on your registry (including your cash funds); standard order information about gifts purchased from your registry; if you register for a cash fund, payment information to enable us to transfer the gift; and which gifts from your registry you have or haven't taken action on (such as shipping, transferring or exchanging a gift);

  * Event details, such as your event date, event location, guest count, budget information and event hashtag;

  * Communications that we exchange with you, including when you contact us through the Website or Services for customer support, via social media or otherwise;

  * Demographic information you voluntarily provide to us through surveys, such as information about your sexual orientation, marital status, education, income, racial or ethnic origin and/or profession (we only use this information for the purposes disclosed at the time you provide such information);

  * Information you provide to us about your preferences (including criteria for potential Vendors and other Vendors (or non-Zola vendors) you are working with, colors, places, trends and styles, as well as photos, Vendors or other items that you add to your "favorites");

  * Other information you choose to provide, which we will use as described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection.




**Information Collected by Automated Means.** When you access and use our Services or visit our Website, we automatically collect certain information about you so that we can personally tailor your online experience and the advertising you receive from us, as well as to analyze and measure use of our Website. To collect this information, we use third-party website analytics tools, including cookies, web beacons and pixels (collectively, "Cookies"). The types of automated information we may obtain using these tools include:

  * Online identifiers, such as your IP address, cookie IDs, mobile ad identifiers, device IDs and similar identifiers;

  * Information about your browser, device or operating system;

  * Web pages you view and links you click on our Website;

  * The buttons or parts of the Website you interact with using keystrokes, movements and clicks; records of website or app events; and other related uses of technology;

  * Dates and times of visits;

This may include, for example, products you purchase from our Website, the number of drafts you create, edit or print when creating invitations, digital stationery or paper products, and whether or not you connect with or book a Vendor through our Vendor Marketplace. If you engage with our chat functionality, we may maintain a record of your conversation for training and customer service purposes.

**Information We Obtain from Third Parties.** We may collect information from other third-party sources, including:

For example, we may receive your Personal Information from advertising networks, media monitoring companies and publicly available sources. We may also combine the information we collect with publicly available information and information we receive from our business partners and other third parties ("Combined Information").




Some of the information described above may be considered "sensitive" under the laws of certain jurisdictions (including payment information, account login credentials, and certain demographic information like race/ethnicity and sexual orientation) ("Sensitive Information"). Whether information is Sensitive Information will depend on the laws of your jurisdiction.

We also share your Personal Information with the following third parties that provide advertising-related services to us. These companies collect information from you via Cookies on our Website, as well as when we share your email address and other information with them directly.

  * **Social Media Platforms.** In some cases, we disclose Personal Information to social media platforms in order to show you more relevant ads on those platforms and to support our advertising and marketing efforts.

  * **Marketing and Advertising Partners.** Our marketing and advertising partners may send you marketing communications, serve you ads tailored to your interests, or tailor ads that may be served to you on our Website or through our Services, as well as on other websites and on social media networks.

  * **Third-Party Data Providers.** Occasionally, we provide our postal mailing list (consisting of customer names and postal addresses) to other companies for purposes of marketing our Website or other Services that may be of interest to you. In order to determine what may be of interest to you, the information that you give us and information about your order may be combined with other Personal Information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) available from our records and other sources.

  * **Ad Networks.** You may see our ads on other websites because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our advertising to users through demographic, behavioral and contextual means. These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including the use of Cookies. The ad networks use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests. The information that our ad network vendors collect includes information about your visits to our Website and other websites, as well as pages you have viewed and the actions you have taken on our Website.




We may also de-identify, anonymize or aggregate your Personal Information so that it is no longer identifiable. We may disclose this information to the individuals or entities listed above to improve our Services and for business, educational and administrative purposes. Similarly, we may permit service providers and third parties to retain certain information in a de-identified, anonymized or aggregated format for their internal purposes, such as research and development and improvement of their services. When we create de-identified data, we do not attempt to re-identify that data.

No mobile information will be shared with third parties/affiliates for marketing/promotional purposes. All the above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties.

Please be aware that any information (including images, the name of your partner, your event location and your event date) that you post to a public-facing portion of our Website (e.g., your registry or personalized website) is publicly available unless you password protect it, and then it is accessible by anyone using the correct password. Additionally, any information that you post on a Community will be publicly available, even if you delete or deactivate your Zola account.

### **IV. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

We will retain your Personal Information for as long as we reasonably consider it necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or for as long as we are required or permitted to retain it under applicable law (including to satisfy our legal, accounting or reporting obligations). To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we may consider factors such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information, the purposes for which we process the Personal Information and the applicable legal requirements.

### **V. WHAT ARE YOUR CHOICES REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

We offer you choices about the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Information.

Please note, however, that without Cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our Website's features. In addition, disabling Cookies may cancel opt-outs that rely on Cookies, such as web analytics or targeted advertising opt-outs. Please note that most opt-out mechanisms (including browser-based signals) are Cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer and browser that is used to submit an opt-out request. If you have multiple computers or change computers, or use multiple browsers, you will need to submit opt-out requests for each such computer or browser. In addition, if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out choices to ensure that any opt-out Cookies remain effective.

  * **Opt-out of Google Analytics.** If you do not want Google Analytics to gather information about how you interact with our Website while you are on our Website, please install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on available here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and employ it at the start of each session on our Website. A Cookie will be set on your browser that instructs this technology not to start for that session. Please note that the next time you access our Website the analytics will be reactivated, so you will have to disable the technology each time. If you reject the Cookies we use, you can still use certain aspects of our Website, but you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our Website's features.

  * **Text Messages.** You may opt in to receive text messages from us in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, by entering a phone number on the Website/Services.

For additional opt-out information, please review our [**Terms of Use**](https://www.zola.com/terms). 




If you are resident of certain states in the U.S., you may also have the following rights regarding your Personal Information (each of which are subject to various exceptions and limitations):

If you would like to exercise your right to opt-out of targeted advertising, as well as the sale/sharing of your Personal Information, please visit our [**Privacy Center**](https://www.zola.com/privacy-center) and fill out our Opt-Out Request Form.

  * Some browsers offer you the ability to opt out of Cookie-based and other online tracking, which may be considered a "sale" or "sharing" of your Personal Information. At this time, we endeavor to respond to browser-based opt-out signals sent through the Global Privacy Control: https://globalprivacycontrol.org/. We do not respond to do not track or other browser-based signals.

  * **Right to Access Your Personal Information.** You can request, up to two times every 12 months, that we provide you with a copy of the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you. In some states, you also have the right to receive information on the categories of third parties or specific third parties with whom we might share your personal information.

  * **Right to Request Correction or Deletion of Your Personal Information.** You can request that we correct or delete the Personal Information we have collected about you.

  * **Right Not to Receive Discriminatory Treatment.** You will not be discriminated against for exercising any of the above rights. However, please keep in mind that some of our Services cannot be provided if we do not have your Personal Information.

  * **Right to Appeal.** You have the right to appeal our denial of any request you make under this section. To exercise your right to appeal, please contact us by email at [privacy@zola.com](mailto:privacy@zola.com) and indicate that you are appealing our response to your previous request.




To exercise the rights described above, you must send us a request that (i) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Information, including by verifying the email address associated with the request and (ii) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a "Valid Request." We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Information provided in a Valid Request to verify you and complete your request. You do not need a Zola account to submit a Valid Request. Only you or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf (an "Authorized Agent") may submit a Valid Request. If an Authorized Agent submits a Valid Request on your behalf, we may require written proof of authorization and verification of identity directly from you.

You or your Authorized Agent may submit a Valid Request by visiting our [Privacy Center](https://www.zola.com/privacy-center) or calling us at (866) 243-2344. In our [Privacy Center](https://www.zola.com/privacy-center), you can submit a deletion or access request, or you can submit a request to opt out of targeted advertising and the sale/sharing of your Personal Information for interest-based advertising. For requests to correct your Personal Information, please email us at [privacy@zola.com](mailto:privacy@zola.com), specifying the Personal Information that is incorrect and how it should be changed.

If you are a California resident and have an established business relationship with us, you have the right to prevent disclosure of your personal information (as defined by Shine the Light) to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. To exercise this right, write us at the email or postal address set out in the Contact Us section below with the subject line “CALIFORNIA SHINE THE LIGHT REQUEST” and specify that you are making a “California Shine the Light Request.” We will respond to requests received in accordance with Shine the Light.

For example, recordings of customer support calls will be retained for two (2) years. For more information about the factors we use to determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Information, please see the [**"How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Information"**](https://www.zola.com/privacy/#section-iv) section of this Privacy Policy.

**Notice of Financial Incentive.** We may also offer you coupons, discounts or other promotions from time to time, such as when you provide us with your email address or phone number and agree to receive marketing communications in exchange for a discount. Such offers may not be available at all times. The amount and terms of such offers will be presented to you at the time of the offer. You can terminate your participation in these offers using the rights described in this Privacy Policy. Our good faith estimate of the value of your Personal Information is the value of the benefit we offer to you. We have calculated such value by using the expense related to the benefit.

### **VII. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION**

**Notice of Changes.** If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy here. If we make any material changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you either through the Website or Services or by email, and where required by applicable law, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt out before such changes take effect.

**Third-Party Sites and Services.** The Website and Services may link to other websites or services that are owned and controlled by third parties. These third-party sites and services may have their own privacy policies, which you should review. We are not responsible for the terms or policies of websites or services that we do not own or control. The inclusion of a link on the Website does not imply Zola's endorsement of the linked site or service.

**Jurisdictional Issues.** Zola is a U.S. company. Our Website/Services are controlled and operated by us from the United States and are not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than those of the United States. Information about you may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. By using the Website/Services, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.

### **VIII. DATA SECURITY**

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us. To protect the information delivered to us electronically, our Website uses Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS encrypts your payment information, name and postal address so only our payment processors, as applicable, are able to decode your information. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our Website, and you do so at your own risk. 

We urge you to create a strong password that is unique to Zola, and not to divulge it to anyone. Also remember to log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place. You are responsible for securing your account credentials for any activities that occur under your account.

### **IX. CHILDREN'S INFORMATION**

We do not solicit or knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18, and do not knowingly sell or share the Personal Information of anyone under the age of 16. If you are not 18 or older, you are not authorized to use our Website or Services. Parents should be aware that there are parental control tools available online that you can use to prevent your children from submitting information online without parental permission or from accessing material that is harmful to minors. If we learn we have collected Personal Information from a child under 13, we will delete such information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided Personal Information to us, please contact us at privacy@zola.com.

### **X. CONTACT US**
