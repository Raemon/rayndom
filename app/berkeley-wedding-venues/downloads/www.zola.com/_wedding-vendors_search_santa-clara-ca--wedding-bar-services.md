Mixmuse 5.0

  * Starts at $500 
  * Serves Santa Clara, CA

At Mixmuse, we believe drinks can be more than just drinks — they can be memories.🧸 I started behind the counter of a tea shop in New York, experimenting with flavors and learning how a simple sip could make someone smile. 🎀 Years later, Mixmuse was born to bring that feeling to weddings and celebrations. Every event we serve is personal — we arrive early, set the scene with décor from our travels, and craft each drink on-site with premium tea leaves, real juice, and organic ingredients. For us, it’s not just about serving drinks — it’s about creating moments your guests will always remember.🌊“Mixmuse is the kind of vendor that truly brings happiness to a wedding. The drinks were phenomenal — you could immediately tell they don’t use syrup but instead real juice and high-quality tea. At the tasting, Amy explained everything to us, and honestly I couldn’t even pick a favorite because they were all so good. On the wedding day, our guests were blown away and kept coming back for more. The table setup was also stunning, filled with unique decorations that Amy and Jimmy collected from their travels. I would 100% recommend them to any couple wanting drinks that make the celebration feel extra special!!!!”Jin, 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/ee8f47ad-d121-4de7-83fc-2fd75100d6e3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/mixmuse)

Barfly SJ 5.0

  * Starts at $250 
  * Serves Santa Clara, CA

Hello! My name is John and I've been in the hospitality / bar service industry for over 15 years. Let's talk about what you envision for your wedding day and I'll help create a custom package that fits your needs!“I can’t recommend Barfly enough for your wedding! They absolutely crushed it and made our day even more special by the custom touches included. From the get-go John was quick to respond, super organized, and made everything so easy. Other vendors we had on our day said John was fantastic to work with as well. He was friendly, fun, and kept the drinks flowing all night. My wife and I had our signature drinks in mind we wanted for our bar before meeting John, but he gave us tastes of his signature cocktails before we decided, and we ended up going with his craft cocktail menu. It was awesome to try samples beforehand and we didn't find any other bar offering this when inquiring. We really liked the bar setup itself as well and it really fit in with our look we wanted - simple, elegant, and custom touches of our own design like the menus on display. Overall, this service was a total game-changer for our wedding. If you’re looking for a mobile bar that’s easy to work with, fun, and makes your day even more memorable, I highly recommend Barfly!”Alicia M., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/barfly-sj)

Sunny Cups Coffee 5.0

  * Starts at $500 
  * Serves Santa Clara, CA

Sunny Cups Coffee exists because we got married :) While planning our own wedding, we realized just how much heart goes into every single detail. Around that same time, we faced a choice many couples do. Do we buy a house or build something together? We chose to build a dream. We combined our love for coffee and planning and created this little business from the ground up. Because we have been in your shoes, we truly get how meaningful every decision feels. We are here to make this part of your day easy, beautiful, and something you can actually enjoy.“Sunny Cups Coffee is awesome! I hired them for my daughter's wedding reception and everyone loved having a coffee cart there and said the coffee drinks were delicious. Guests also loved that there was matcha! And our tea drinkers were happy, too. The Sunny Cups Coffee team was punctual, courteous, and accommodating. Everything went smoothly, and our out-of-town guests were glad to have some caffeine for the drive home. Hire Sunny Cups- you won't be disappointed!”Bonnie S., 10 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/8ffc17b9-060d-49bc-913c-06879fbf2625?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/sunny-cups-coffee)

My venue had some very strict alcohol restrictions. Like only canned cocktails They worked with me every step of the way and elevated those canned cocktails so you couldn't even tell that it was cutwaters. They somehow made them taste so much better. They also worked with us to include custom artwork of our pets on cans of beer and cider. They even included that artwork in the custom menu they provided. They also surprised us with an adorable mirror decoration that made its way into a LOT of our photos(pictured below). They were also so nice. All my guests could talk about is how nice they were. They were so responsive every step of the way. My wedding planner said that Candace was the most responsive vendor she's ever worked with.

  * Starts at $600 
  * Serves Santa Clara, CA

Derived by the idea of 3 sisters and their individual love of beverages. Handcrafted Cocktails 🍸, Coffee ☕️ & Tea 🫖. Hence Sipsters, a play off sisters and sips! We are a “dry hire” mobile bartending service. This is the concept where we provide the bar, bartender/s, mixers, garnishes and aesthetics and the client provides the alcohol (in which we help you curate a shopping list). This allows the client more flexibility, customization and most importantly cost savings. Meant for those that do not want to pay exuberant mark up on alcohol that venues, bars and restaurants typically charge.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We hired Sipsters to bartend my birthday party and they brought the bar and the party! They were very communicative and responsive throughout the planning process, ensuring our vision was executed perfectly. They worked with us to come up with signature drinks that matched our luau theme and the drinks came out beautifully and were a big hit. and They not only set up their service bar, but also help me bring a mimosa bar vision to life. They helped make the celebration extra special and we would definitely use them again!”Judi, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/b67999bb-8858-42f1-9422-c3535764d7af?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/sipsters--2)

I reached out to Melissa and Claye with Movin’ & Shakin’ and they were so kind and helpful through such a challenging and stressful time. Their trailer was so cute and their cocktails were delicious. They communicated great with us to solidify a menu and their service window to stay within our budget. They offered a mimosa bar for the bridal party prior to the service, created a twist on my favorite cocktail, and even had a Bloody Mary bar set for the following morning.
