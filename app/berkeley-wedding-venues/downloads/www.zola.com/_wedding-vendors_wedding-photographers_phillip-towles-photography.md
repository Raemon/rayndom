We had a wonderful experience working with Phillip Towles Photography for our wedding and engagement photos. Phillip was great to work with - he communicated with us in an informative, timely manner and was always thorough in answering our questions. He has fantastic people skills and made us feel at ease throughout the whole process. He asked us questions to better understand what we wanted and helped us figure out what we needed to know ahead of time. The quality of Phillip's work is truly amazing. He is talented at capturing authentic moments and adapting to any situation. His strong work ethic was evident in the beautiful photos he delivered for our engagement photos. We know our wedding photos will be just as amazing when he delivers them. A real highlight was when Phillip had us laughing during the session - it led to more natural, joyful photos. We took a memorable photo with Phillip that we'll cherish. Overall, I'd highly recommend Phillip Towles Photography for wedding/engagement and videography . His communication, professionalism and stellar photography skills made our wedding photos better than we could have imagined.

I’ve had the pleasure of working with Phillip on multiple occasions. He is polite, professional, and excellent at his craft. Phillip has a perfect balance of being able to organize and control a large group or stand back and document quiet moments.

## Frequently asked questions

8 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 10 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Sometimes, I’ll bring one or more assistant photographers depending on the size of your wedding. Don’t worry, this won’t cost you extra.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

YES. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### Do you also offer video services?

Yes, I try to be a one stop shop for capturing your wedding day.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 3-4 weeks after your wedding.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 300 images per event. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

To this date I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my contracted photographers. I’ll also still be handling the editing process to ensure the final product is consistent with the work I advertise.
