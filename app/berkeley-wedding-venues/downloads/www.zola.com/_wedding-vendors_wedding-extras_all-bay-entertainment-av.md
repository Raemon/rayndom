  * ### Lighting & Sound

•Verified review

•Guillermo T.•Jun 18, 2025

All Bay Entertainment AV was a fantastic vendor to work with for our wedding. They were extremely responsive, helpful, and transparent throughout the entire process. The quality of their work was top-notch - they were quick, safe, and very trustworthy. They made sure the music and lighting were perfect, and were very attentive to all of our needs. We couldn't have asked for a better AV team to contribute to our special day.

  * ### All Bay Delivered – Just What We Needed!

•Verified review

•Monica•Jun 18, 2025

All Bay Entertainment AV exceeded my expectations! From start to finish, their customer service was outstanding—friendly, responsive, and easy to communicate with. They delivered and set everything up right on time, and their professionalism really stood out throughout the process. The lighting was a showstopper—it completely transformed the space and added a wow factor to the event. I couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out. Highly recommend and would absolutely use them again!
