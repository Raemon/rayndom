  * ### Arizona Yacht Club 

•Verified review

•Eric•Dec 30, 2024

Working with Chef John's Events & Catering for the Arizona Yacht Club's annual Birthday Regatta was a fantastic experience. Their communication throughout the planning process was prompt, complete, and informative, making the event organization a breeze. The quality of their work was exceptional - the food they served was delicious, plentiful, and an incredible value. They kept the food line moving efficiently and the serving stations spotless, ensuring our 150 hungry guests were well-fed after a long day of sailing. I highly recommend Chef John's Events & Catering for any special event.
