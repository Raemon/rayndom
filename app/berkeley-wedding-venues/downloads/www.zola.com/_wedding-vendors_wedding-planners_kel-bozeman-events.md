## About Kel Bozeman Events

### Kel Bozeman Events

Owner and Lead Planner

I was born and raised in a beautiful valley in Western Colorado. I prefer living in small towns, but I like visiting big cities and finding all the best restaurants. Even though I spent most of my life in the west, I am enjoying the opportunity of living in new places. Along with event planning, a few other things that I love are my husband, my daughters, dogs (but especially my own), mountains, home improvement projects, camping, thunderstorms, dance parties, any and all dessert, cooking, and wearing the color black.

My passion for weddings and events began with my passion for design. I started college with a major in Graphic Design but discovered my true calling in the Experience Design & Management program. After entering the event planning world, I saw my eye for design, knack for organization, and attention to detail mesh together and I immediately knew this is what I am meant to do. Life has a funny way of guiding you to where you are supposed to be. That lead me to focus on creating events that highlight guest experience while focusing on creating something beautiful.

**In three words:** Confident, Creative, Organized

  * ### The BEST wedding planner

•Verified review

•Rylee H.•Apr 6, 2025

Kel Bozeman Events was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. From the start, Mikelle demonstrated active listening, respect, and responsiveness, ensuring our vision was brought to life. Her work was commendable, proficient, detailed, and outstanding - she made sure everything went according to plan and timeline, paid close attention to every detail, and handled any stressful situations with excellent communication and calm professionalism. We couldn't have asked for a more excellent wedding planner, and we highly recommend Kel Bozeman Events to any future clients or brides.
