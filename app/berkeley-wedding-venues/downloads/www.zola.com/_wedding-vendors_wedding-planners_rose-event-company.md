I’m Ashley, the owner of Rose Event Co. I love being able to share in the love of two individuals and feel lucky to get to work with such wonderful people each day! I’ve been planning weddings and events for over eight years now, and I couldn’t be more thankful with where I am now in my business. I primarily serve the OR | WA | CA markets, but will travel anywhere!

I care about making your event the best possible experience for everyone involved. I take care of all the small, tedious details and arrangements so that my clients can focus on the important stuff. I make the effort to understand your exact needs, so the event you imagine is the event you’ll get.

**In three words:** Calm, Creative, Positive

  * ### Rose Event Partial Wedding Planning

•Verified review

•Eunice & S.•Dec 3, 2025

We used Rose Event for partial planning as we don't live locally in Central Oregon. She has been very communicative and available for meetings and responsive during the planning phase, which is one of her strongest assets. She helped with organizing and collecting items that are needed for the wedding day, which was much appreciated. She also didn't mind communicating on behalf of us to vendors, venue, and other people who volunteered to help with our wedding planning. We understand that there are various personalities with families and guests, last minute wedding day anxieties, but we also trust her that she has the skills to manage the day. The only feedback we have is on rehearsal day and the wedding day, we wish to have seen more assertiveness and leadership to chorale us and the crowd, and encouraged us to step back from worrying about logistics. Otherwise, overall, we had a very good experience with Rose Event!

Response from vendor•Dec 3, 2025

Hi Eunice & Sean - Thank you for taking the time to write a review. I am sorry you felt that the group was not “choraled” on the day of or rehearsal. All of the events happened within 5 minutes of their scheduled start times, and I spent over an hour with your group at the rehearsal as a member of your family was very involved and wanted to keep making her own plan, and that is who you were listening to for guidance. Like you said, there are several different personalities in weddings and I do not ever think it’s my place to tell your family what to do when it seems as though you only want to do whatever they say. My job was to make sure the order was correct and everyone knew where they would be walking to and where/how to exit. Everyone was lined up perfectly for the ceremony and went exactly where they were supposed to go up at the front as well as exited in the correct order. The only thing that I can think of is when Sean came to ask about the cake cutting photos, which I relayed to your photographer who said she was letting you enjoy the wedding and would get around to it eventually. Everything was also all packed up by the venues end time and put in the designated area for you to take back with you. I ran your wedding the exact same way as I run all my clients weddings, and made sure everything went according to the plan we had in place before the big day. Again, sorry you felt this way, but appreciate the feedback!

  * ### Ashley Is Pure Magic — Calm, Creative & Gifted

•Verified review

•Katharine H.•Dec 1, 2025

If you’re looking for a wedding planner who is equal parts calm, brilliant, kind, organized, and downright magical — look no further than Ashley. From the moment we started planning, Ashley saved us both time and money in ways we didn’t even know were possible. She sourced incredible vendors within our budget, presented thoughtful options that actually aligned with our vision, and somehow managed to keep track of every tiny detail along the way. Her resourcefulness alone paid for itself ten times over. Ashley also had the unique ability to navigate and balance our very different planning styles — my Type A tendencies and my husband’s more last-minute approach — with so much grace, humor, and patience. We often joked that we wished we could keep her in our lives forever to make all our daily decisions, because she made everything feel lighter and easier. There were a couple moments when certain vendors didn’t follow through according to their contracts, and Ashley stepped in immediately, handled everything professionally, and made sure nothing fell through the cracks. She was our advocate in every sense. Her attention to detail was unparalleled. She monitored the weather for weeks leading up to the big day, and she was absolutely right — though it was gorgeous, the wind changed several elements of our ceremony and décor. Because she anticipated it, planned for it, and had contingencies ready, everything went more smoothly than it ever could have without her preparation. She also helped coordinate the other events throughout our wedding weekend, making each one feel special and seamless. Even the bathroom baskets she curated for guests were thoughtful and beautifully done. Every single guest has told us how wonderful the wedding and the entire experience felt — and we couldn’t agree more. Weddings will always have at least some chaos, but with Ashley by our side we were protected from most of it, and we remained calm even in the moments that could have easily unraveled. She was truly one of the main reasons everyone had such an incredible time. We are endlessly grateful for her, and we cannot recommend her highly enough. Hiring Ashley was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding.

Hi Kate! Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review. I absolutely loved our time working together. You and Sean were such wonderful, kind clients. I am so happy with how your wedding weekend turned out and am glad to hear that all the guests had a very memorable time.

  * ### Rose Event Co. went above and beyond! 

•Verified review

•Jenna•Oct 15, 2025

Where do I even begin? Ashley from Rose Event Co is genuine, kind, and personable, making her a pleasure to work with! From our initial call, I felt at ease and I could instantly tell that Ashley’s easy-going and calm demeanor would be a fit for us. She went above and beyond with our day-of coordination and was excellent at communicating with us and our vendors. She was always an email or text away when it came down to the final days before the wedding and I had a question or idea! Ashley is also very thorough and detail-oriented. She made sure we had everything covered, including a few things I hadn’t thought of myself!We were truly so happy with how our entire wedding day turned out and having someone as talented and professional as Ashley from Rose Event Co. made everything feel effortless. Thank you, Ashley & Rose Event Co! We appreciate you️

  * ### Ashley is the BEST!!

•Verified review

•Rachael S.•Aug 24, 2025

Hiring Ashley at Rose Event Co as our Day of Wedding Coordinator was definitely one of the best decisions we made in planning our wedding. I thought I was going to be able to manage planning our entire wedding myself, but as the day crept closer and closer, I realized that I was definitely going to need a hand. We spoke with a dozen different coordinators, and Ashley just stood out SO strongly amongst the rest. To put it as simply as possible, she saw our vision, she understood it, she stood in and shared in it with us. She knew exactly how to support us in making it happen, and she was easily able to make us feel that. We initially had concerns about her being located so far away from us (we're in Oakland, CA), but she put those concerns to rest so quickly! Throughout my months of planning after hiring Ashley, she was always there to answer my questions, and provide support and reassurance in all of the little things that I just wasn't sure how to handle myself, and she did so with such grace, patience, and an air of calm that was so extremely helpful and reassuring. When the month of our wedding arrived, Ashley quickly got to work on communicating with and organizing all of our vendors and laying out the structure for the day. She traveled to Monte Rio to be with us the day before our big day, walked us through the ceremony, went over all of the details, and left us so confident and comfortable in her extremely capable hands. The day of the wedding, Ashley handled EVERYTHING and EVERYONE with such care and tranquility. All of our wedding vendors absolutely loved her, and we never stopped hearing about how great she was to work with! Ashley is an absolute BOSS in all of the best ways that you can imagine! She is supportive, encouraging, communicative, active, helpful, caring, the list just goes on and on. She wants you to succeed, and you can FEEL it. She remembered and double checked on all of the little details, before, during, and after our wedding, and words simply cannot express our gratitude. She did so many things automatically, that I hadn't even thought to discuss with her, but was so grateful that we had her there to do. Thank you Ashley!! She did so many little things that I didn't even realize until I started looking through all of our photos, and noticed that they had all been done. On top of all of that, she basically packed up the entirety of our decor with the assistance of her extremely helpful husband, which was such a huge relief for us and for our wedding party who had put so much into the day. We were all able to completely disconnect and just enjoy the evening, which was so unbelievably priceless. There are so many things that make Ashley stand out from other coordinators. So many coordinators that we had talked to before Ashley had a big list of things that they would NOT do, but not Ashley. She was willing to do whatever needed to be done to ensure that our wedding day went perfectly, and it did, thanks to her!! HUGE bonus, she brought along her Super 8 camera, and we CANNOT WAIT to see the footage!! If you're looking for someone who has your back, and can handle ALL of the things with a level of calm that oozes into everyone around her, HIRE ASHLEY! You absolutely will not regret it. Thank you so much Ashley, for EVERYTHING that you did, and for ALL of your help in making our wedding day so unbelievably perfect!!
