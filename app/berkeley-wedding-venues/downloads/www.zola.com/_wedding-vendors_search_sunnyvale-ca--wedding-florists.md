We actually booked them fairly late, around August when our wedding was in November. I had thought I could DIY flowers and last minute decided against it. They were easy to book a consult with, listened to every single thing I wanted, put it all into their online portal where I could upload inspo photos too, and sent a quote over quickly! They also easily adjusted it for me when I changed my mind on a few things. Payment was easily made online, and I was able to make changes up until a week out. Everything was delivered on time and exactly as expected on the day of! The bouquets and arch turned out exactly as I had imagined them! They were able to provide tips for the garlands and loose flowers, and overall were very easy to work with, provided everything I wanted, and everything turned out beautiful! They were reasonably priced compared to competitors in the area as well. I would recommend them to other brides! :)”Brittany R., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/b71cbf63-c916-416a-9470-e85d0bb48b16?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/expressions-floral)

We used one of her arches for the ceremony, and she was able to transfer the arch florals to our sweetheart table at the reception (which was at a different location than the ceremony to boot), which I so appreciated. The centerpieces and bud vase arrangements and everything looked so beautiful, and were actually bigger than I expected! She was never pushy or trying to upsell about anything, and even suggested a more cost effective way to get a lush look on the tables - leaf scatter instead of more arrangements! On the day-of it ended up being sort of long branches of leaves, and they looked so beautiful. She also was so accommodating when I wanted to make my own bud vases, and helped me make sure they were the right size and shape and that she got them in time. Thank you Beth!”Christina B., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/ce8ff763-df83-46c1-bfc1-4cc58f1a401f?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/sassy-diva-designs-events)

She is an incredible wedding and event planner and a gifted florist with an exceptional eye for design and detail. I had a very specific vision for my dream wedding—which included multiple venues and complex logistics—and Yulia brought it all to life beautifully. From assembling an amazing team of photographers, makeup artists, and videographers, to coordinating every detail on the day-of, she handled everything with grace and precision. She created and delivered the most stunning floral arrangements, and cleverly designed them to be used across multiple locations (ceremony and reception). She even handcrafted my seating labels and added thoughtful, personal touches throughout the event. I was able to fully enjoy the day knowing she had everything handled. Beyond my wedding, Yulia also planned my baby shower and continues to be my go-to for beautiful floral arrangements. I'm pretty indecisive, so having her as a thought partner throughout the wedding process was a lifesaver—she helped me make key decisions with confidence and was always available to text, brainstorm, and support. Yulia goes above and beyond for her clients, and I truly could not have done it without her. Anyone who gets the chance to work with her is in incredibly good hands!”Caitlin R., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/37e66aef-1e8e-4848-bbb1-53f238fb34a1?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/flolette-usa)

Working with her was a breeze, and she is incredibly knowledgeable. We connected early in the wedding planning process and had a Zoom call to discuss my needs and inspiration. She was able to tell me what types of flowers were in the inspiration and what would realistically work for the time of year and my budget. As the wedding date approached and we finalized the number of centerpieces needed, Marisol was flexible and helped adjust the order to best utilize the flowers. Closer to the wedding, we met with my coordinator and quickly finalized all the details. Marisol shared photos of the fresh flowers upon their arrival, and I was thrilled with the beautiful bouquets, boutonnieres, arch floral piece, and centerpieces on the big day. I only wish we could keep fresh flowers forever! Thankfully, I got to enjoy the centerpieces a little longer by taking some home. Marisol's dedication and talent truly made our wedding day special.

H & J Flowers 5.0

  * Serves Sunnyvale, CA

We love creating custom floral arrangements and other wedding decor. What started as something fun to do for family and friends quickly became a way to share our creativity with others. We are dedicated to making your wedding decor something your guests will be talking about for years to come. Anyone can have flowers at their wedding, but we want yours to be memorable. We specialize in unique, custom designs that bring a couple's personality to the forefront.“When I first got engaged, every instagram post I saw from local venues where I was obsessing over the florals turned out to be creations from H & J Flowers! So before I even had a venue, I reached out to Hylary and told her I HAD to have her and her team as my florists! From the first phone call Hylary was a dream to work with! She even helped me find amazing options for different venues at the beginning of my planning journey!! I had told her which wedding on their website portfolio really stood out to me, and she tweaked it based on our conversation to match my style a little closer and to include my favorite flowers (sunflowers) in the centerpieces and bouquets, too! She was so responsive and supportive during all interactions and was flexible with changes that I had to make about a month before the big day! We had a micro wedding for our day, so the florals had to be delivered to the hotel instead of the venue per our venue contract which they were happy to accommodate! When I tell you my jaw was on the floor when I saw my bridal bouquet, it would be an understatement. H & J Flowers created masterpieces that were beyond what I could have ever imagined. My bouquet was STUNNING and was exactly what every bride dreams to hold on their special day. The centerpieces were amazingly gorgeous and complimented the venue seamlessly. And the corsages and boutonnières were high quality and simply perfect. We are so thankful to Hylary, Jason, Jacquie, and the rest of the team for bringing so much beauty and magic to our wedding day! I wish I could have kept all of the florals forever, but I'll settle for having my bouquet pressed so it will last a lifetime.”Allison M., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/3bd7172e-295e-44b6-b2fd-c7f0e06d5fa2?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/h-j-flowers)

The way the florals were arranged at the venue was also what I imagined how it would look like! We wanted bud vases as our table centerpieces and Mariane and her team arranged them so well and they looked so good with the lamps and votives! Budget is a big thing for me and Mariane was able to work with me on that without sacrificing quality, and she was also helpful with ideas on how we can repurpose our flowers :)”Kairin, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/63a8cdbf-ec10-42d3-a667-e011c6fc9674?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/c-m-fleuri)

I enjoyed not having to waste flowers the day after our wedding, I could send them back in for the next bride!

Flower Moxie – Do-It-Yourself Wedding Flowers 4.9

  * Starts at $350

In 2013, 8-year wedding veteran Amy McCord Jones realizes she wouldn't be able to afford to hire her own floral services if she was a bride. Then, Amy discovers that there is basically zero help available for DIY brides. No flower recipes. No instructions. No access to florist-grade blooms. Rude. So she launches Flower Moxie! Flower Moxie remains a humble, tucked-away small business out of Oklahoma City. We don’t zoom around on scooters in some fancy high-rise. We stock an average kitchen with canned wine and Aldi chips and listen to true crime podcasts while photographing curvy ranunculus. Join us. There’s cake, hugs, and acceptance here.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I ordered the "peaches and cream" small package. We decided to skip on ceremony florals, and only have handhelds and bud vases at the reception. We did buy a few more flowers from the grocery to add more peach once the flowers arrived. We made and medium sized bridal bouquet, 4 bridesmaids bouquets, 3 corsages, and 7 bouts. (With lots of flowers left over). My bridesmaids and I did the arranging the morning before the wedding; it was fun, and a great start to the weekend. None of us had experience, but it all turned out great!

Believe it or not, we often have people ask if our pictures throughout our website are showing a mix of fresh and faux and…no they aren’t! Although fresh florals are pretty, we are totally in love with poser-blooms all the way here and that’s what we design 100% of our orders with.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Use The Faux Bouquets! I know there are a lot of options out there for faux florals, but this company really stands out. Absolutely gorgeous selections. We chose one of the more basic options because of our color scheme but there were so many more stunning, fun and colorful options out there as well! We used them for the bouquets and boutonnieres and it made life so easy. No need to worry about the flowers staying alive or getting water stains on your dresses. We had everything in bins ready to go before wedding day. Great pricing. The bouquets are so full and you can see the thought that goes into choosing the colors, type, and placement of each flower. The company communication is quick, kind, informative, and they are just all around amazing!”Caley, 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/7d67de16-f308-4dd2-a912-f22d069307ee?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/the-faux-bouquets)

My name is Judy Leung (she/her) and Found Floral is based in San Francisco Bay area & beyond. Found floral is rooted in intentional and modern approach to floral and event design. With a focus on creating a flowerful experience that celebrates the culture and stories that are uniquely yours.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Judy at Found Floral was one of the best decisions my husband and I made during our wedding planning process! I knew I wanted florals that were textured and unique and not too cookie-cutter or traditional, so this was my top criteria when searching for a florist. Judy was able to masterfully bring the vintage backyard dinner party feel to our wedding which had 260 guests and still make our wedding feel unique (each table had different tropical and rarely seen flowers). Over 20 of our guests have mentioned to me since how much they loved the florals at our wedding since then - so many people have complimented our florals and shared that they are their favorite florals they've ever seen at a wedding and are still thinking about them today (some guests even have group texts focused specifically on our wedding florals)! The other big thing Judy did for us was the florals for the mandap (arch) for the ceremony - it was so spectacular and such an incredible focal point! It was raining for our entire ceremony so we were grateful to have a pop of color against the grey backdrop. The Found Floral team also used such unique flowers for the arch and laid them out in a way that was the perfect balance of textured but also refined (without being stiff or overly formal). My favorite part of working with Judy was that she took the time to understand my vision but then was able to operate and make decisions independently to bring that vision to life. There are 10000 things to do during wedding planning and it was such a relief to know we were in good hands with Judy and not having to make tiny decisions like picking out individual flowers or greenery or designing much of anything. I would work with Judy again in a heartbeat - she has such a chic unique style and is warm and makes her clients feel so comfortable at every stage of the process. Found Floral truly is the best florist in the Bay Area!!”Joanna K., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/12e771a6-5cf2-412f-aac0-2cd9ab246860?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/found-floral)
