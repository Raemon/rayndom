  * ### 5 STAR REVIEW FOR THE RANCH AT SILVER CREEK

•Verified review

•Rebekah B.•Nov 23, 2025

Oh my gosh, there are no words to explain how perfect our wedding day was. The entire team was amazing and the venue was absolutely stunning! From the first moment me and my husband visited The Ranch, we knew this was the one. The entire staff was very warm and welcoming from the very beginning and they were in constant communication with us every step of the way. I never felt abandoned and my questions were always answered. I had full confidence and faith in them for my wedding day and they did an outstanding job. From setting up our decor exactly how I wanted it, to handling last minute seating chart requests, I felt supported the entire way. The was the best day of mine and my husbands lives and we are so so grateful for the entire team at The Ranch. A huge shoutout to Sarah, the one who gave us a tour of the venue and took care of us during our first meeting, our coordinator Teresa who was outstanding and very sweet, and our banquet captain Megan and trainee Tyler. Your wedding day is the one of the days, if not the only day, that you will remember for the rest of your life. We are sooooo lucky ours was one of those days you hear about in fairytales. I am tearing up right now as I write this! We are so grateful for The Ranch and how nice they were to us. There are no words to explain, we are forever grateful for The Ranch family!!!! :)) With eternal love -The Aldanas

  * ### A Perfect Wedding Experience at The Ranch!

•Verified review

•Jennifer N.•Jul 24, 2025

Planning a wedding can be overwhelming, but our experience with The Ranch at Silver Creek by Wedgewood Weddings was completely stress-free and nothing short of amazing. From day one, the team made us feel so supported and cared for — and our wedding day turned out to be even more beautiful than we imagined. Ingrid, our coordinator, was incredible. She kept everything organized, guided us through every step, and truly made the whole process feel effortless. Teresa, our banquet captain, made the day-of flow like clockwork and was such a calming presence. We also want to thank Tyler, Sarah, and Monica — every single person we worked with was professional, warm, and so genuinely invested in making our day special. As a Vietnamese family, there was some initial hesitation from our relatives about doing a Western-style ceremony and reception. But by the end of the night, our entire family was completely won over. They couldn’t stop raving about how elegant, thoughtful, and stress-free everything was. It made such a difference that everything — the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception — took place under one roof, making the day simple and enjoyable for everyone. We also appreciated how transparent and inclusive the pricing was. Everything we needed was part of one easy-to-understand package, and at the same time, everything was customizable to match our vision. The team was incredibly flexible and never once made us feel pressured — even when we brought in outside vendors or made changes along the way. We got to attend their Summer Open House, which was such a fun and helpful experience — we met their preferred vendors, tasted food, and really got a sense of what the day could look like. One of the biggest compliments we received was from our guests — several of our friends absolutely loved the venue and are now looking to book their own weddings at The Ranch! I would strongly recommend Wedgewood Weddings, but especially The Ranch, because the staff there made us feel like their closest friends and family. They remembered little details we mentioned months earlier, treated us and our loved ones with so much care, and created genuine connections with our bridal party and family. Honestly, I’m a little sad I won’t be seeing them as often — that’s how special they made this experience for us. If you’re looking for a beautiful venue with an outstanding team who will go above and beyond to bring your dream day to life — The Ranch at Silver Creek is the one. We’re so thankful we chose them, and we’ll never forget how supported and loved we felt throughout the entire process.

•Jamie & B.•Dec 19, 2024

From the moment we started planning our wedding at The Ranch at Silver Creek by Wedgewood Weddings, the staff was incredibly attentive, responsive, and open to collaborating with us. Their expertise and knowledge of the venue and the wedding planning process took a lot of the stress off of us. The property itself is absolutely beautiful, with multiple areas that allowed us to get creative and make the space our own. On the day of the wedding, the staff kept us informed about the windy weather and offered helpful suggestions, ensuring everything ran smoothly. I would highly recommend this Wedgewood Weddings location to anyone looking for a stunning venue with an amazing team to support them through the entire wedding planning journey.

  * ### Amazing

•Verified review

•Nicole F.•Aug 20, 2024

My husband and I just got married at The Ranch on August 16th. We have nothing but rave reviews for all of the staff. Ingrid was amazing at our last planning appointment. Tyler was our rehearsal and day of coordinator and he has everything under control. Jasmine was our evening captain and again, flawless. The food was good, the staff was constantly checking in, making sure we were well taken care of. API and Officially Yours were also absolutely amazing. Highly recommend this wonderful team.
