It's obvious why this radiant locale is a 'Best of the Bay' winner!

  * ### 10 out of 10!

•Verified review

•Katrina S.•Oct 31, 2025

We couldn't be happier with how our wedding turned out. From start to finish, the Wedgewood team was professional and accommodating and so attentive to detail. Their online portal and regular check ins made the planning process a breeze. We used most of their preferred vendors, and every one of them was fantastic. Everyone raved about the food and the beauty of the venue. It really is beautiful from every angle. We highly recommend this venue, and probably any Wedgewood venue based on this experience!

  * ### Amazing venue and coordinators

•Verified review

•Gabriel N.•Oct 8, 2025

Gabriel and I would love to thank Jefferson Street Mansion's team for an amazing wedding day and all the events leading up to it. The coordinators made sure to go above and beyond for us. It was not hard to contact them at all whenever we had any questions. Day of, our wedding coordinator Kathy Vanover has been so sweet, amazing, and professional! We could not recommend JSM by Wedgewood weddings enough. Our family and friends tell us what a lovely venue it was and we completely agree!

  * ### Love love love

•Racquel A.•Sep 20, 2025

The team at Jefferson Street Mansion By Wedgewood Weddings was fantastic to work with throughout our entire wedding planning process. They communicated with us consistently and ensured all of our appointments were scheduled and completed as agreed. Everything about our wedding day was amazing - the food was delicious, the bar was great, and our guests raved about how fun the celebration was. The coordinator, Sophia, made sure our day went exactly according to plan and even put together a cute video for us. We also received a very personal thank you card from the venue, which made us feel so taken care of. The venue itself is absolutely beautiful, and the entire staff was incredibly sweet. We highly recommend Jefferson Street Mansion By Wedgewood Weddings for any couple looking for a stress-free, all-inclusive wedding experience.

  * ### Wonderful venue!

•Verified review

•Valeria and D.•Jul 15, 2025

Jefferson Mansion was a very beautiful venue. The team made our wedding dreams come true. They are very professional and made the process of planning our wedding go smoothly. We HIGHLY suggest using their recommended vendors and taking advantage of any discounts they offer. Our guests really enjoyed their catered food and their florist and bakery did an amazing job! Our one critique is that we wish they were more clear in the beginning on additional costs to ceremony and reception decor that could appear to be included when looking at the photos or touring the venue. Overall, our experience was wonderful with them and we do not regret going with Jefferson Street Mansion by Wedgewood Weddings.
