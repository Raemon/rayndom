Mint + Peonies Floral Studio 5.0

  * Starts at $3,500 
  * Serves Santa Rosa, CA

Hi, I’m Griselda, a Northern California wine country wedding florist and mom of three. My journey into floral design began as a healing path through postpartum depression and grew into a passion for creating meaningful, beautiful weddings. I thrive on connecting with couples, learning their unique stories, and crafting timeless designs that bring their vision to life. With a love for creativity and detail, I’m here to help you make long-lasting memories and create stunning backdrops for your special day.“To say Griselda delivered would be an understatement— she absolutely blew our expectations out of the water. I contacted her weeks before our elopement. Not only did she squeeze me in, but she also made a digital mock up so I felt comfortable moving forward with the purchase. These weren’t just flowers… this was art. Our photographer (who has seen many florals and table scapes) even commented that this is one of the best she has ever seen. TY for making our day extra special.”Alex A., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/bfededf5-c662-40c7-9093-e178def7c632?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/mint-peonies-floral-studio)

Flower Moxie – Do-It-Yourself Wedding Flowers 4.9

  * Starts at $350 
  * Serves Santa Rosa, CA

In 2013, 8-year wedding veteran Amy McCord Jones realizes she wouldn't be able to afford to hire her own floral services if she was a bride. Then, Amy discovers that there is basically zero help available for DIY brides. No flower recipes. No instructions. No access to florist-grade blooms. Rude. So she launches Flower Moxie! Flower Moxie remains a humble, tucked-away small business out of Oklahoma City. We don’t zoom around on scooters in some fancy high-rise. We stock an average kitchen with canned wine and Aldi chips and listen to true crime podcasts while photographing curvy ranunculus. Join us. There’s cake, hugs, and acceptance here.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Flower Moxie was an incredible experience from start to finish. The flowers arrived without any issues, and we had almost a 0% loss of flowers (which is unheard of). The tutorials helped me feel so ready to assemble my own bouquets and our self-assembly not only was SO FUN to do with my bridesmaids, but saved us SO MUCH money!!!

From start to finish, she made the process so easy and stress-free. She provided us with beautifully detailed PDFs that outlined every arrangement, flower choice, and cost breakdown, which gave us so much confidence in the planning process. On the wedding day, every piece she created was stunning—whimsical, thoughtful, and perfectly in line with our color scheme. Johannah incorporated both mine and my husband’s birth month flowers into the bridal bouquet and boutonnière, which made them so personal and meaningful. From the bouquets and boutonnières to the aisle markers, bud vases, candles, and even the greenery for our seating chart, every detail felt intentional and artfully designed. The ceremony altar pieces and bar arrangement were breathtaking focal points that our guests couldn’t stop complimenting. Having her handle both setup and takedown was such a gift—it allowed us to be fully present and enjoy our celebration without worrying about logistics.

To be fair we were warned about the process, but not about the length of time due to our inexperience. As a note, it took my fiancé 5 hours to process the flowers when first receiving them. I also did not have any updates from them from the time I ordered till they were being shipped. They were beyond more affordable compared to other florists, and the flowers arrived alive and in good spirits. We were able to keep the flowers alive for over four days!! Many of the flowers that we chose did not have specific instructions, so we had to follow the general reference for the flowers and hope for the best. Additionally, some of the flowers that we wanted were not in stock, and they were replaced for us with substitutes but were not notified until we had all of the flowers already delivered to us. Also, as a note, bloom culture uses third party sellers for their flowers, so the quality may vary depending on location. Our flowers were in good condition, and the company we had clearly took good care of the flowers prior to delivering them to us. Would we do it again? Probably not, but it made for good laughs and bonding time and we have stories to tell from it!”Hannah H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/36a6f8b7-2bac-47a0-89d6-63ff0d0d678c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/bloom-culture-flowers)

Found Floral 5.0

  * Starts at $15,000 
  * Serves Santa Rosa, CA

My name is Judy Leung (she/her) and Found Floral is based in San Francisco Bay area & beyond. Found floral is rooted in intentional and modern approach to floral and event design. With a focus on creating a flowerful experience that celebrates the culture and stories that are uniquely yours.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Judy at Found Floral was one of the best decisions my husband and I made during our wedding planning process! I knew I wanted florals that were textured and unique and not too cookie-cutter or traditional, so this was my top criteria when searching for a florist. Judy was able to masterfully bring the vintage backyard dinner party feel to our wedding which had 260 guests and still make our wedding feel unique (each table had different tropical and rarely seen flowers). Over 20 of our guests have mentioned to me since how much they loved the florals at our wedding since then - so many people have complimented our florals and shared that they are their favorite florals they've ever seen at a wedding and are still thinking about them today (some guests even have group texts focused specifically on our wedding florals)! The other big thing Judy did for us was the florals for the mandap (arch) for the ceremony - it was so spectacular and such an incredible focal point! It was raining for our entire ceremony so we were grateful to have a pop of color against the grey backdrop. The Found Floral team also used such unique flowers for the arch and laid them out in a way that was the perfect balance of textured but also refined (without being stiff or overly formal). My favorite part of working with Judy was that she took the time to understand my vision but then was able to operate and make decisions independently to bring that vision to life. There are 10000 things to do during wedding planning and it was such a relief to know we were in good hands with Judy and not having to make tiny decisions like picking out individual flowers or greenery or designing much of anything. I would work with Judy again in a heartbeat - she has such a chic unique style and is warm and makes her clients feel so comfortable at every stage of the process. Found Floral truly is the best florist in the Bay Area!!”Joanna K., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/12e771a6-5cf2-412f-aac0-2cd9ab246860?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/found-floral)

From the very beginning, they were quick to reply, patient with all of our questions, and consistently communicative throughout the entire process.

The quality of their work was outstanding, and the value they provided was beyond what we could have hoped for. They worked thoughtfully within our budget, never making us feel like we had to compromise on our vision. Their strike team was worth every penny, handling everything seamlessly so that we could simply enjoy the day without worrying about logistics. It truly felt effortless, and that kind of stress-free experience is priceless. One of the things we loved most was how Alba captured our wedding theme perfectly. We had shared our Pinterest board, and they brought it to life in a way that felt even better than we imagined. Every floral arrangement, every detail, was so intentional and cohesive—it was like stepping into the dream we had been envisioning for months. They even went above and beyond by sending us progress photos along the way, which made us feel included and excited during the planning process. On top of that, they shared so much of our wedding on their Instagram, which was such a fun surprise and gave us another way to relive the day. What stood out most, though, was the genuine care Alba showed for us and our special day. It never felt like we were just another client; they treated our wedding with the same love and attention they would give to their own family.

Calling her a florist feels like such an understatement—she is truly an artist. Not only is she incredibly sweet and thoughtful, but her vision, creativity, and attention to detail are absolutely unmatched. When I started planning my wedding, I had a few color palettes and a Pinterest board for inspiration, but I wasn’t set on specific flowers. What I wanted was a romantic, ethereal, gardenesque feel with editorial and Spanish-inspired elements. Andrea was the one who helped me bring that dream to life—and honestly, helped me discover my overall wedding theme in the first place. She completely understood the vibe and went above and beyond to design something magical. I gave Andrea the freedom to lead creatively, and she blew me away. She was incredibly communicative—checking in with color palette updates, floral ideas, and even creating sample arrangements (which I’ve learned is a rarity in the wedding world!). She was so generous with her time and insight—even offering design suggestions for things like napkins and linens, which she absolutely nailed. On the day of the wedding, Andrea showed up five hours early just to make sure everything was perfect. The amount of care, effort, and artistry she put into our day was unbelievable. Guests couldn’t stop raving about the florals—everyone was stunned. Andrea’s work truly transformed our space and created the romantic, editorial ambiance I had only dreamed of. If I could give her a hundred stars, I would. She was hands down my favorite vendor of the entire wedding process, and to be honest, I think she should be charging way more for the level of expertise and love she brings to her work. I cannot recommend her enough.”Phuong V., 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/b4bff13a-edcb-4b61-a687-6d1d2a51efb6?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/amour-de-gitane-floral)
