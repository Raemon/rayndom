Cloud Yummy Catering 4.7

  * Starts at $2,000 
  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

I am the Owner and Chef of Cloud Yummy Catering, with a lifelong passion for cooking shaped from an early age. Growing up in a family-run Sichuan restaurant, I was immersed in traditional techniques and large-scale wedding banquets, learning how food brings people together for meaningful celebrations. After living in the San Francisco Bay Area for over 22 years, I founded Cloud Yummy Catering to reflect California’s cultural diversity through thoughtfully crafted, well-balanced global cuisine. I also introduced AI-powered menu planning through our website to help couples plan confidently while keeping hospitality personal and human.“We had a wonderful experience with Cloud Yummy catering team for our wedding. Our guest count was small (only 20 people), and we found that many caterers had high minimum requirements, but Cloud Yummy were very accommodating and comfortable working with a small group, which made a huge difference for us. Ivy, the owner, was incredibly helpful throughout the planning process. She gave thoughtful recommendations on menu selections and food combinations, and was always willing to accommodate our preferences and needs. Her guidance made planning much less stressful. On the wedding day, both the food and service were excellent. Everything was beautifully prepared and our guests loved it. We’re so glad we chose them and would highly recommend them, especially for couples planning an intimate wedding.”Cher, a month ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/cloud-yummy-catering)

Nora Spanish Cuisine 3.3

  * Starts at $3,000 
  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

Ñora Cocina Española is a full service catering company, serving the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond. We strive to bring you the essence of the Spanish dining experience, taking care of the details to ensure the event is as seamless and stress-free as possible. Ñora can handle everything from menu planning (including vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options), event coordination, rentals, decorations, staffing and more! Our team of experts can help make any vision into a reality. Whether it’s a spectacular wedding of 200 guests or an intimate gathering for 20, no event is too large or small.“My husband and I are from different cultures. We have relatives who think paprika is spicy and friends who love more flavor. We wanted food that would be a crowd-pleaser for all our guests. We were also on a strict budget. Every other caterer wanted to charge way more for food that didn't sound all that exciting. I was so happy when I found Nora. We went with three paellas, tapas, and a grazing board. The paellas were a big hit, and everyone got to have a delicious meal. It was also a cool experience for our guests to see the paellas being cooked. Alexa, Emily, and the staff were great, but they are quite busy, so communication can be slow. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend Nora for your event. I knocked down a star because their communication skills aren't the best, but they were flexible on all our menu requests and were very accommodating to our last-minute timeline.”Happy B., 10 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/nora-spanish-cuisine)

Midsummer Kitchen 5.0

  * Starts at $7,900 
  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

Catering the SF Bay Area since 2011 - we are an extension of your hospitality and believe in meaningful events with delicious food and reliable service. Our team is composed of industry professionals who are committed to the success of your event.“I hired MidSummer Kitchen to cater my wedding and it was absolutely fantastic! The food was phenomenal, everyone kept coming over to me during the reception to tell me how much they loved the food. Communication was so easy - quick responses, easy to understand, and always professional. The Midsummer catering crew during my wedding were also very professional and kind. Leading up to the wedding, I worked a lot with Cleodia. She was very kind, professional, and understanding whenever I had question or had to make changes to the plan. 2 months before my wedding, I had a problem with my venue and Cleodia was a great help. She helped me remain calm during my panic, helped me find possible new venues, and worked with me to create a quick solution to a major problem. I honestly don't think I would have found a new venue without Cleodia's help and I am very grateful. I would 100% recommend MidSummer Kitchen for all your catering needs. If I could rate higher than 5 stars, I would.”Megan M., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/midsummer-kitchen)

Sabores Komali 5.0

  * Starts at $1,750 
  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

We’re Cinthya and Maya, a married couple and co-founders of Sabores Komali, a catering company rooted in Mexican tradition and community. Chef Maya was born in Acapulco, Mexico, and has spent the last 25 years infusing her food with warmth, creativity, and cultura. Cinthya, raised in the Bay Area by Mexican immigrant parents, brings a deep love for community to our work. Sabores Komali is a celebration of Mexican identity through food. Named after the comal—a traditional griddle and symbol of home—our work is about more than meals. It’s our way of continuing the tradition of Mexican hospitality; full of love, generosity, and connection.“We hired Sabores Komali to cater my mom’s 60th birthday party and couldn’t be happier with the experience. From the start, they were incredibly easy to communicate and organize with, super professional and responsive. The food was so good! We had a mix of small bites and a taco bar. The shrimp ceviche, empanadas, and esquites were all huge hits with our guests. My whole family couldn’t stop talking about how delicious everything was. The taco bar was also delicious, with a variety of toppings and satisfying protein options that really made the meal feel curated to our taste. Everything ran smoothly, and we felt really well taken care of. You can feel the love and care Sabores Komali puts into their food and service. Highly recommend for any special event!”Stefanie L., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/029f5326-f202-43ce-95dd-8038780282de?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/sabores-komali)

YOOSHI SUSHI CATERING & EVENT PRODUCTION 5.0

  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

I had my first shot at managing a sushi restaurant when I took over an empty section of the family restaurant and introduced sushi to my customers. It was a challenge that I will never regret accepting. It was fun, a lot of fun! I had the opportunity to work with some really talented and creative chefs. I quickly learned that it’s not just about having fresh fish anymore. Sushi dining has transformed into a culture. A culture built by imagination and creativity. With the help of GD and the support of my family, I took all that experience and fused it with my imagination and created Yooshi Sushi Catering and Event Production.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Great to order from really good value too.

Chef John Alvarez, raised in the Bay Area, discovered his passion for cooking early, earning the nickname “tortilla boy” at 12 while working in his family’s restaurant.

For our January 2025 wedding at the stunning Seymour Marine Center, we envisioned a customized buffet that reflected our love for both Asian and Italian cuisine. Chef Alvarez not only met, but exceeded our expectations. He crafted a truly unique and delicious menu that perfectly captured our favorite dishes, leaving our guests raving about the incredible flavors and variety. Beyond the exquisite food, the presentation was impeccable. The desserts, in particular, were a feast for the eyes and the palate – beautifully presented and utterly delicious. In fact, the food was so captivating that we were completely swept away in the moment and even forgot to take pictures! That’s a testament to how much we and our guests were enjoying the culinary experience. But what truly set Five Course Provisions apart was the five-star service. From the initial consultation to the wedding day itself, Chef Alvarez and his team were professional, attentive, and genuinely enthusiastic about making our day special. Their friendly demeanor and seamless execution allowed us to relax and fully enjoy our celebration.

Aloha Poke Bar 5.0

  * Starts at $500 
  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

Aloha! My name is Yvette and I am the owner and founder of Aloha Poke Bar. Our mobile poke cart comes to you with easy set up and break down and makes the perfect addition to enhance your special day. What is poke? Poke (po-keh) is the Hawaiian word to “slice” or “cut crosswise” and has been served as a traditional raw fish dish around the islands for many generations. We provide a true taste and experience of Hawai’i’s diverse culture and flavor using only locally sourced fish and ingredients. Our unlimited customizable toppings bar creates a fun and interactive experience for guests to select their own flavors suitable to every palate.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From the moment we reached out, the team at Aloha Poke Bar was expedient, kind, open, and accommodating in their communication. They went the extra mile to ensure our wedding was a reflection of our culture, even providing an educational and authentic poke experience for our guests. The fresh, generous portions were not only delicious, but the owner's stunning rendition of "Amazed" as a wedding gift made the day even more special. Without Aloha Poke, we wouldn't have had the food or the perfect wedding song that we'll cherish forever. We're so grateful for their generosity and for helping to make our special day unforgettable!”Mrs. Nohea T., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/aloha-poke-bar)
