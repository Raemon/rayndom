• I love to customize the look and feel of wedding ceremonies to meet the aspirations and imagination of my couples. • Perform personalized, romantic, memorable wedding ceremonies - elopements, weddings, and vows renewal in LA, Ventura, Santa Barbara counties. • Christian 💒, non-religious, non-denominational, LGBTQ+🌈. • I provide marriage license guidance 📜, write wedding scripts ✍️, and help with vows ❤️.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Julia was amazing in the process of planning our ceremony from start to finish, in fact had I not come across Julia our wedding may have had a completely different outcome. When I first inquired with Julia my husband and I were aiming on planning a small ceremony at Santa Barbara court house. Julia took the time and effort to schedule a zoom meeting with us right away and thanks to Julia’s experience we quickly learned the court house was not going to be the ceremony for us. Julia went above and beyond to help us navigate towards a ceremony that would be much better suited for us and our guests to a point that I mentioned she felt like she was stepping into a wedding planner’s role along with being an excellent officiant. Leading up closer to the ceremony she took the time to perfect a draft and mock up of what our ceremony would be like and that began to really easy our nerves. We knew we were in good hands seeing how organized and professional Julia had been during the entire process and the day of the ceremony surpassed our expectations. She took the time to meet with my husband and his parents as they waited my arrival, took leadership in orchestrating the start of the wedding procession and took a moment to meet me in front of the church before the start of our ceremony to calm my nerves and remind me what the importance of our wedding and ceremony was. Days after our ceremony my husband and I got several compliments on how personal and touching our ceremony was and that was a great deal to do with Julia! All in all we would highly recommend Julia and can’t thank her enough for the huge role she played in our wedding.”Analee M., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/c7330b0c-be7d-4dd7-a98d-3f320344fdad?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/wedding-officiant-julia-garcia--2)

Wedding officiant Heidi's only job is to make sure that you both have a wonderful ceremony that feels right to you. It should be memorable for the right reasons, have some laughter, a little bit of romance, and show your love for each other. She will capture your personal love story and your ceremony will definitely Not be long and boring! Heidi has married over 650 couples since 2016 and she's known for making the process easy and stress free for you. As a former wedding planner, she makes sure your ceremony flows smoothly and she will help you feel calm and actually enjoy your ceremony!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“My husband and I had so much fun working with Heidi from Love Story Vows! From the moment we met Heidi and her wonderful photographer husband, Alan, we knew they were the perfect duo for our Safari Park wedding. They were helpful, communicative, and constantly positive. With Heidi's easy to follow resources and clear questionnaires and forms, together we created the most perfect, nature-centric ceremony. Many of our guests were blown away by our heartfelt ceremony and details of our love story. As a type A bride, Heidi and I had a lot of back and forth emails trying to get the ceremony just right, and she even added a special piece about the symbolism between the Safari animals and our marriage, something very important to us. I think we must have called to the animals, because the most serendipitous thing happened during the ceremony-- a parade of several giraffes came galloping along right behind us, right before I was going to say my vows. We were all completely awestruck, it was just the perfect moment. When we look back on our wedding day, we are blessed to have memories of Heidi's calming and reliable presence. She gave us water, positivity, and delivered the most beautiful ceremony. Our guests who had the chance to meet Heidi, shared with us what a kind person she was. Many also said they loved the tone of her voice and how she was very professional and had the audience in control. Heidi and Alan are both so knowledgeable about weddings, and with their help we felt confident that we had a solid timeline. We felt very well taken care of in their presence. Thank you!”Amanda G., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/b85350eb-f415-49df-bf82-79da264e438e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/love-story-vows)

L + A Union Ceremonies 5.0 Hawthorne, CA

Hi, I'm Lilian Argueta, a proud Guatemalan American, native Angelina, and the heart behind L+A Union Ceremonies. I’ve always believed in the power of human connection and the importance of honoring it with authenticity, care, and soul. I’ve been a certified officiant since 2017, and my path to this work has been anything but traditional—in the best way. L+A stands for Luz y Amor, light and love in Spanish. It’s more than a name; it’s a belief system. I believe we are all energy, all light…and when two people come together in love, something truly magical happens. That magic deserves to be witnessed and celebrated with intention & creativity.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We hit a stroke of luck when we found Lilian on Zola! From our very first call, my husband and I felt an instant connection with her.

Lilian truly brought our wedding to life. It was a perfect 10/10 experience!”Joyce, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/e9ad6c5a-fd8c-4a5e-9350-099633db0bf5?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/l-a-union-ceremonies)

Terry is experienced and when we talked about some of the complexities of our family’s needs and our own vision, she was able to make it come together better than I ever could’ve dreamed! She and Fabian even stepped in when the inevitable hiccups occurred before the ceremony. We mostly only brought in family and friends to work with us on our wedding, limiting the outside vendors. By the first meeting at brunch over bengients, they felt like family. We will forever be grateful that fate brought them to us and they were part of our special day.

Ryan was incredibly thorough, professional, and kind, and made the entire experience feel personal and seamless. During the ceremony, Ryan’s presence was outstanding.

Ready to create an unforgettable ceremony for the most important day of your life? I’d be honored to help you with that. As an ordained minister, wedding planner, and copywriter, I offer a unique combination of skills to help me create the perfect custom wedding ceremony—tailor-made for you. I use my interpersonal nature to get to know you as a couple, your love story, and your important must-haves—and my way with words to craft a heartfelt and memorable ceremony that uniquely captures and conveys your essence in front of all your nearest and dearest.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Ingrid is not only an amazing wedding coordinator, but she is also an amazing wedding officiant. She took our love story and crazy ceremony ideas (such as taking a shot with us along with our guests before we sealed the deal or taping our ring box underneath one of the chairs for a surprise ring bearer) and created the ceremony of our dreams. To hear from multiple guests that it was the best ceremony they attended was the best compliment we could receive because the ceremony is the most important part of a wedding. It was my favorite part of my wedding. Then she can amazingly switch gears from officiant to wedding coordinator and rock that too. She can do it all (literally). I always have other couples tell us that their wedding day goes by very fast and they didn’t really get to enjoy all the little things. However, my husband and I felt like our special day did not go by so fast and we most definitely got to enjoy the little things mainly because Ingrid took care of everything behind the scenes that no one sees. I am very sad I won’t get to work with her anymore unless I get married again lol, but I would recommend her to anyone I know and hopefully get to see her in action again.”Kimberly O., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/d9408ce5-c511-4aaa-a43f-3ca22084db0f?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/grand-entrance-affairs--2)

Born in Australia, lived in Scotland, I've now been in the US for 10 years, I presided over my first wedding in 2016. Being asked by two of my oldest friends changed my life forever. But I was crazy nervous. That first ceremony elicited something inside of me I never expected. I LOVED, love! I had a feeling of pride and community I'd never experienced before. More and more friends asked me to officiate their weddings over the years until I finally said "frick it, maybe this is my thing." Becoming an officiant has been one of the most rewarding things I've done, experiencing your marriage ceremony with you is now something I look forward to.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I can't recommend Sam Does Weddings enough!! He was the perfect officiant: kind, humorous, patient and most of all understanding! From the moment we chose Sam, he was always available and had genuine care and consideration for our relationship. He took the time to truly understand us as a couple and beautifully captured the essence of our relationship in the ceremony. We wanted a short, unplugged ceremony with the perfect balance of humor and heartfelt moments, and Sam delivered exactly that. He crafted a service that actually felt like us - not generic or overly formal, but filled with love and authenticity that resonated with everyone present. Throughout the planning process, Sam was incredibly helpful and responsive. He gently guided us to ensure we were hitting all the right notes while still giving us the flexibility to make the ceremony our own. He shaped and refined our own telling of our story into something truly special. I still get giddy thinking about when my husband and I read our ceremony script over a glass of wine at dinner! Though what truly sets Sam apart is his attention to detail and thoughtful touches - he even came prepped with a sneaky shot of our favorite drink for both of us right after we said "I do" which was MUCH needed (iykyk) If you're looking for an officiant who will take the time to understand your unique story, respect your wishes, and create a ceremony that perfectly reflects who you are as a couple, Sam is your person.

Hola, I’m Ernesto (he/him/él), The Out Officiant! Ordained by the ULC, I began officiating in 2019 and bring heart, humor, and authenticity to every ceremony. As a gay Latino who’s been through wedding planning myself, I know how vital it is to feel seen and supported. I specialize in LGBTQ+, bilingual, and multicultural weddings, always inclusive, personalized, and stress-free. Based in El Cerrito, my fee varies by distance. Let’s create a ceremony that celebrates your love story!“Ernesto is the best officiant!

Highly recommend him!”Fahima, 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/9c02a433-6a3c-4597-a4ab-28941f6074a2?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/the-out-officiant)

I'm Rev. Dr. Jeff Saville, (call me Jeff) a retired Navy chaplain with 26 yrs military service and real church pastor (not just ordained online). I can lead a highly customized & personalized wedding ceremony at a winery, golf club, beach, on a military base or in a hot air balloon! Or if you just need to be quickly/legally married very inexpensively, I do that too! When you contact me you will quickly receive detailed info, a sample but customizable ceremony, and offer times for a free consultation by videocall to answer questions about levels of service (Gold/Silver/Bronze), the fees, OPTIONAL Premarital Counseling and more!“We had a wonderful experience with Pastor Jeff as our wedding officiant. From our first video call, he took the time to get to know us and made the whole process feel personable and comfortable. He guided us through planning the ceremony with clear communication over email, phone, and video calls, and even hosted a mini-rehearsal at his home and answered all of our questions with great detail. On the wedding day, he arrived looking great in the outfit we’d chosen and took time to coach everyone through their roles before the ceremony. The ceremony itself was beautifully led—thoughtful, heartfelt, and seamless. Afterwards, he even sent us photos he had taken, which was such a kind touch. Pastor Jeff was professional, organized, and truly a joy to work with—we highly recommend him!!!”Ani A., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/e557cc5a-e6b2-453f-9f2a-da67ae9475ed?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/socal-christian-weddings)

Shundo David Haye, Zen Priest 5.0 San Francisco, CA

  * Offers 10 ceremony types
  * Starts at $400 
  * Serves California

I have been a Zen Priest since 2009, and have been officiating weddings since 2011. To everything I do I bring fifteen years of residential zen training at San Francisco Zen Center, including five years of intense monastic training at Tassajara, and many silent retreats. As a wedding officiant I am proud to have performed many same-sex marriages, and many of the couples I have married have been multi-cultural. I am often asked to wear my Buddhist robes for the ceremony, but that is entirely up to the couple. Ceremonies have ranged in size from the couple, me and the photographer, to much more formal settings for up to two hundred people.“As fellow meditators, it was a joy to have Shundo officiate our wedding. Shundo's communication style was clear, helpful, and timely throughout the process. He gladly scheduled Zoom calls to learn more about us and to guide us through the vows process (one that we were unknowledgeable about XD). He was also very flexible when we wanted to change how the ceremony was structured. Shundo's work was sincere, compassionate, happy, and joyful. We're grateful that Shundo traveled all the way from San Francisco to Saratoga for our wedding and also mailed in our marriage certificate. Shundo's warm smile and presence truly made our special day even more memorable. Thank you c: - Allie & Eric”Allison W., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/679d8b78-3b6d-414b-9cb4-38349d60eaf4?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/shundo-david-haye-zen-priest)

With 35 years in beauty, 20+ years in wellness, and 3 years officiating over 100 ceremonies, she brings unique experience to your special day. Shannon writes every ceremony from scratch after getting to know you through "Get to Know Each Other" calls. She handles all paperwork and logistics, making your wedding, elopement, or vow renewal completely stress-free.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Shannon was one of the very best decisions we made for our wedding day. She went far beyond what we ever expected from an officiant and made our ceremony not only beautiful, but truly personal and unforgettable. From the very beginning, she took the time to get to know us as a couple, guiding us through a meditation and visualization session that helped us get clear on what we wanted our ceremony to feel like. That experience alone brought us closer together and set the tone for everything that followed. On the day of our wedding, she arrived early and was a calming, grounding presence for me as I got ready. She even led me through a short breathwork session that helped ease my nerves and allowed me to feel centered before walking down the aisle. Throughout the ceremony, her words were heartfelt, perfectly tailored to us, and delivered with so much warmth and grace. What stood out most was how she made sure every detail flowed seamlessly. Honestly, she played a role even more important than my maid of honor in keeping me grounded and ensuring everything went smoothly. Because of her care, presence, and thoughtful guidance, our day was absolutely perfect. If you are looking for someone who will not just officiate, but truly honor and elevate your ceremony with heart, intention, and love, I cannot recommend Shannon enough. She is extraordinary.”Fiona C., 5 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/shannon-bryson-ceremonies)

Hello there! I'm Patrick, a professional wedding officiant based in Paso Robles, California...Our little drinking town, with a farming problem...but I do travel! I take absolute delight in helping make your wedding ceremony just as you envisioned it. After all, it's your special day! In addition to working as an officiant, I'm also the owner of a distillery in Paso Robles, a voice-over specialist, and I have a multiple-subject teaching credential.

We recommend him to anyone who is looking for someone who can command a crowd well (not always common in officiants) and bring a dash of humor to the ceremony while saying on-tone The feedback from our guests about the ceremony & Patrick's role in it was resoundingly positive As an added bonus, Patrick himself is an incredibly funny and genuine person, and I'm happy to have gotten to know him through the process Thank you again Patrick for doing an outstanding job Preston & Caroline”Preston P., 7 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/pronounced-by-patrick--2)

Hello and Congratulations! I have the best job in the world because I get to tell your story and connect you to each other and your guests. I love to have fun! As a former nurse and teacher, I am sensitive to individual needs and I am very comfortable in front of people.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Meg’s Ceremonies was truly the perfect choice for our wedding officiant, and we feel so lucky to have found her. From the very beginning, Meg made us feel at ease. She was incredibly communicative, always open to feedback, and quick to respond to our messages—no matter how small the question or how last-minute the request. It felt like we had someone in our corner who genuinely cared about making our ceremony reflect us, and that kind of support meant the world during such a busy and emotional time. In the weeks leading up to the wedding, Meg guided us through the process with patience and kindness. She took the time to learn our story, listen to our ideas, and weave them together into something that felt both personal and polished. We never once felt rushed or pressured; instead, Meg created a space where we could be ourselves and trust that she would bring our vision to life. On the wedding day itself, Meg exceeded every expectation. Her attention to detail was impeccable, and her comedic timing was spot-on—she had our guests laughing, smiling, and tearing up in all the right moments. The way she told our story was heartfelt and hilarious, striking that perfect balance between romance and humor that we had hoped for. Our friends and family still talk about how much they enjoyed the ceremony, and we know that’s thanks to Meg’s talent and warmth. Beyond the ceremony, Meg went above and beyond to make the entire experience seamless. While we were busy mingling with family and taking photos, she quietly took care of signing the marriage license so we didn’t have to worry about a thing. She even surprised us with a sweet goodie bag and a personalized book that matched the pastel and floral theme of our wedding—a thoughtful touch that made us feel so seen and celebrated. Looking back, we couldn’t have asked for a better officiant. Meg brought joy, professionalism, and genuine heart to every step of the process. The value she provided was exceptional, but more importantly, she gave us memories we’ll cherish forever. If you’re looking for someone who is warm, professional, and truly gifted at what she does, we cannot recommend Meg’s Ceremonies enough. She will make your day not only beautiful, but unforgettable.”Victoria D., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/7c2f2fc4-02ce-4be2-b7d5-d515e1559258?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/meg-s-ceremonies)

I love working with couples to write a ceremony that is authentic to their love story and with all the details they envision. I've officiated estate-sized wine country weddings and those at the Ritz; to ceremonies in art galleries and country clubs, to shoreline and backyard elopements, and vow renewals at a family picnic or a restaurant--each one just as special as the other.“Saundra is a professional and easy to work with. She really knew how to make our ceremony extra special. From her coordination and help during the rehearsal she made the ceremony go forward smoothly. She was also very communicative and helpful in filing the final marriage license. I would recommend Saundra to any couple getting married in the Bay Area.”Omar Q., 12 days ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/i-do-x-two)

What I love about being an officiant is getting to know my couples. What their hopes and dreams are as individuals and as a couple. What they like about each other, what their favorite things they like to do together, and what makes them a couple. Putting all those things together in a memorable wedding ceremony is my passion. My ceremonies are always as individual as my couples. Every relationship is special and unique and I enjoy creating and sharing how you both got to this day, this moment. Your Story. The Best Love Story. Ever.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Renne was just lovely. From our first meeting, she was so warm, down to earth and easy to talk to. She immediately had us feeling at ease with her genuine care. Our wedding ceremony was a perfect story of us and our love story. She managed to capture the uniqueness and beauty of our relationship and our loved ones were in tears. It set the stage for such a meaningful celebration. She printed out our ceremony and vows and we keep them in our wedding box. We open it every year and read it together as a way of reflecting on our love and remembering our values and promises we made to each other.

It's a great privilege and pleasure to celebrate each couple's unique love story and relationship with a wedding ceremony that is personal yet traditional, always warm and inclusive. I have been working with couples for 30 years, and I love every part of the process - from the psycho-spiritual conversations before the ceremony, to the sacred experience of standing beneath the wedding canopy. I strive to weave together each partner's narrative with the Jewish rituals that sanctify a relationship in ways that reflect each couple's shared values and connections.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I have known Rabbi Ridberg since I was a young child and she was the rabbi at my synagogue. I prepared for my bat mitzvah with her and she played a formative role in my Jewish development. I knew for many years I would want her to officiate my wedding and when the time came she was a true joy to work with. My husband and I met with her regularly before the wedding, discussing the meaning of marriage, our wedding and our respective and combined spirituality. During the ceremony she explained with clarity and meaning the jewish traditions to incorporate our guests.

Santa Cruz Officiant 5.0 Santa Cruz, CA

  * Offers 10 ceremony types
  * Starts at $600 
  * Serves California

Hi, I’m Naomi—a multi-award-winning wedding officiant known for ceremonies that feel like soul nourishment. I’m part marriage midwife, part mythic storyteller, part fierce loving mama bear. I help couples stay grounded, connected, and deeply seen on one of the most important days of their lives. Rooted in years of cross cultural study, I create inclusive, wildly meaningful, sacred but non-religious ceremonies. Guests swear I must be a family member or close friend. I’m a reverend gone rogue—innovating modern rites with heart, humor, and holy intention, and creating ceremonies that feel like home to you—and unforgettable to everyone else.“Choosing Naomi as our officiant was one of the very best decisions we made for our wedding. She embodies so much warmth and wisdom and has an extremely thoughtful process of getting to know her couples. We wanted our ceremony to be the most special part of our day, and while we trusted her from the beginning, we couldn’t have imagined a ceremony as beautiful as the one she delivered. We wanted to really feel the transition, the peace, the profoundness of the moment, and Naomi gave us this and so much more. Every word was meaningful and deeply personal, not a single one wasted. She slowed everything down. She helped us and our guests all be still and truly present and to notice even the tiniest details that were made not so tiny by the awareness: the trees, the smell of the cool forest air, the crow flying overhead. She was a grounding presence that steadied us in a moment that is often nerve-ridden and blurry for many people. Friends and family all commented on how it was the most beautiful ceremony they had ever been to. One friend even said that he had never been to a wedding where the ceremony was the best part until ours. If you are looking for an officiant who can truly see you and your partner, someone who is capable of honoring your story and your dreams, someone to anchor you in a whirlwind moment while acknowledging how once in a lifetime it is, then run don’t walk to connect with Naomi. You will be so glad you did.”Aubrey D W., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/80d63589-0bb1-4013-a25b-6caa57917793?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/santa-cruz-officiant)

I am passionate about officiating creative, soulful ceremonies about you and your relationship that also include a touch of fun. No template weddings here! I believe your ceremony should be about you - personal to your style and your story.“I can't say how grateful I am to Roxanne for officiating our wedding. She brought so much warmth and joy to the process from the very beginning. She made sure everything was buttoned up perfectly and made it all run as smoothly as you could dream of. She even managed to get some additional pictures from people who just happened to be walking past our ceremony! She ensured we felt special and were able to focus on each other and the moment rather then the logistics, and that meant the world to us.”Eric V., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/82bc98d2-d8b0-4c9a-b24a-c2f951f6b608?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/weddings-by-roxanne-hunt)

Hello! I’m Daniel and I’m honored to be considered for your big day! From my home in sunny Sacramento, California, I work with couples to make their ceremonies memorable, meaningful to them and engaging for guests. I guide my couples through the planning process of the ceremony from brainstorming symbols of unity to ordering a copy of your wedding certificate from the county.“We couldn’t be happier with our decision to have D officiate our wedding. From start to finish, he was warm, professional, and incredibly thoughtful. He guided us through the entire process with ease, taking the stress out of one of the most important parts of the day. On the big day, D delivered a ceremony that was truly perfect. He thoughtfully incorporated the religious elements we wanted in order to honor and respect my parents' beliefs, seamlessly blended two different cultures and languages, and added a few nerdy, personal touches that made it feel uniquely us. We’re so grateful to D for helping create such a meaningful and memorable moment. Highly recommend!”Esther T., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/a-guy-in-a-vest)
