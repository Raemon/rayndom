Aw Snap! Bay Area PhotoBooth was an absolute delight to work with for our wedding! From the moment we booked them, their communication was attentive, kind, and punctual. The quality of their work and overall value was truly awesome - they were incredibly respectful and responsive throughout the entire process. On the day of our wedding, they made it completely hands-off for my wife and I, which was so appreciated as we were focused on enjoying our special day. Couldn't have asked for a better service and more fun time at our wedding. Aw Snap! arrived on time and were very attentive, giving us and our guests a wonderful photo booth experience. EJ and the entire crew provided great customer service and communication from start to finish. I highly recommend Aw Snap! Bay Area PhotoBooth to anyone looking to add an exciting and memorable element to their event!

## Frequently asked questions

9 Answers

Ask them a question

### What makes Aw Snap! Bay Area different from other photo booth companies?

We believe your photo booth should feel as special as your wedding day. Every setup is personalized to your style — from the design and backdrop to the lighting and tone. We bring warmth, creativity, and genuine care so you and your guests enjoy an experience that’s as memorable as your photos.

### Do you offer prints, digital photos, or both?

We offer both! Couples can choose from our digital-only or print-inclusive packages. Digital photos are sent instantly via text or email, and prints are customized to match your wedding theme — giving guests a keepsake they’ll treasure.

### Is setup and teardown included?

Absolutely. Every package includes full setup and teardown so you can focus on enjoying your day. We arrive early to ensure everything runs perfectly before your guests even arrive.

### Do you travel outside of Fairfield?

Absolutely! We proudly serve the entire Bay Area — from Napa and Sonoma to San Francisco, San Jose, and beyond. Travel fees may apply for locations outside our standard service area, but we’ll always be upfront about costs.

### How far in advance should we book?

We recommend booking as soon as your date is set. Spring and fall wedding weekends tend to fill up quickly — sometimes months in advance — so the earlier, the better!

### Can we customize our photo template and backdrop?

Yes! Every wedding deserves a personal touch. We’ll design a custom photo template that matches your theme and colors perfectly, and you can choose from our curated backdrop collection to complete the look.

### Do you provide an attendant?

Yes! Every booth comes with a friendly, professional attendant who keeps the energy high and ensures your guests have an amazing time.

### Can guests access their photos during and after the wedding?

Definitely! Every event comes with a private online gallery where you and your guests can view, download, and share photos — it’s live during the event and accessible after.

### What do you need from the venue?

Just an electrical outlet and access to WiFi for instant sharing. We’ll handle the rest — including setup, breakdown, and all the fun in between!
