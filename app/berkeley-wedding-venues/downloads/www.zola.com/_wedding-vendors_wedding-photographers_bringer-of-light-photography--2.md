My name is Luca, and I’m the artist behind Bringer of Light Photography. A solo-run, heart-driven, editorial-meets-documentary brand for the tender-hearted & brave. My work is built on the idea that photographs are not just decorations, but inheritances. I’ll meet you where you are. awkward, giddy, tearful, reverent, undone - and we’ll co-create something beautiful. This is not a factory. It’s me, showing up with my whole heart to create something that feels true to you. If you want your story told with integrity, emotion, and reverence, you're in the right place. I'm so excited to meet you.

My photography is known for love that just feels like real love, and the I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE GOT THAT shot. I call it 'fine-art imagery for lyrical souls' for a reason. I'm talkin’ chills down the spine, goosebumps down the arms kinda feels. Photography is my great love. Your wedding is safe in my hands for imagery that brings you to tears year after year after year.

•Rae'keisha D.•Aug 18, 2025

Hiring Luca as our wedding photographer was hands down one of the best decisions we made during the entire planning process. From our very first conversation, I knew we were in the presence of someone not just with technical skill, but with a heart for people, and an artist’s eye for light and emotion. Luca somehow managed to be everywhere at once, catching every moment we didn’t even realize was happening. Her ability to capture the feeling of the day, not just the events, still blows my mind. Our sneak peeks came within 24 hours and made me cry happy tears all over again. The full gallery? I can’t even explain. We didn’t just receive photos. We received a gift that I’ll be showing my grandchildren one day, saying, “This was the day I married your grandpa.” Luca, thank you for treating our day like it mattered to you, too. For anyone even thinking about booking her: do it before someone else gets your date. Seriously.

  * ### Calm, Creative, and Incredibly Gifted

•Verified review

•Ranie G.•May 21, 2025

From the moment we met Luca, we knew she was the right person to capture our wedding. She didn’t just document the big moments - she paid attention to the small, meaningful details that made private beach wedding day uniquely ours. Her creativity and professionalism instantly put us at ease, which was such a gift during all the nerves of the day. Luca brought a calming presence, endless patience, and such care to every part of the process. She made us feel seen, celebrated, and completely comfortable in front of the camera. The entire experience was truly unforgettable. We’re so thankful for the heart and talent Luca poured into our day, and we couldn’t have asked for a better photographer!

  * ### Best Beach Proposal!

•Verified review

•Nick R.•May 15, 2025

I was beyond thrilled with the stunning work Luca did for our engagement proposal on the beach. From the very first moment, she displayed impeccable professionalism, punctuality, and a true understanding of what we wanted. She captured every beautiful detail of the proposal with such grace, ensuring that the surprise element remained perfect, while still being incredibly candid and intimate. Her editing is flawless, and the final photos are nothing short of magical. Each shot perfectly encapsulated the emotions of the moment, and we couldn’t be more grateful for how beautifully she documented this milestone in our lives. We were amazed at how seamlessly she knew exactly where to be, what to capture, and how to create the perfect atmosphere. Thank you, Luca , for making our engagement unforgettable. You truly have an eye for creating timeless memories!

  * ### Wonderful Wedding Photographer!

•Verified review

•Annie & D.•Jan 16, 2024

Luca photographed our wedding and did a wonderful job. She was responsive throughout the whole process and flexible to our needs. She had great ideas for fun prompts for the two of us in our couples session. We especially liked her ability to capture more candid and natural moments.

## Frequently asked questions

13 Answers

Ask them a question

### what types of photography do you do?

I offer: Proposal Photography, Wedding Photography, and Engagement Photography. If you fall outside these domains, contact me anyway! I’ll see what I can do :)

### do you provide videography?

At this time, nope! Maybe someday in the future.

### what is your photography style?

I’ve developed a unique style of photography that is deeply rooted in photojournalism while influenced by fine-art and editorial photography. I LOVE creative lighting, unique perspectives, angles, compositions and artistic post-production refining to bring out my clients’ personalities & beauty while telling their amazing story! I pride myself artistry & expressive imagery. To see examples, please visit my gallery.

### do you back up our images?

YES. Immediately after our session, I backup the images from multiple SD cards to a local hard-drive, as well as copy to an offsite hard-drive. At any given point, there are two copies of your images in two different locations.

### do you provide unedited RAW files?

I don’t! At the RAW state the images are not edited and don’t yet represent my photography. Part of what you’ve invested in me is my post-processing!

### do you offer consultations?

yes! I am happy to meet with you virtually or in-person (for my SC locals) free of charge in order to discuss details further! Schedule a meeting at this link here -> https://bringeroflightphoto.hbportal.co/public/6824d731ff4a480024b91102

### when will I get my pictures back?

This depends on the season! If I’m in the weeds of wedding season, I can’t go quite as quickly as I’d like. But — I boast a speedy fast turnaround time for my wedding clients of 5 weeks. The goal will always be for you to have your images back on the 1 month mark. For portrait sessions, I estimate 3-4 weeks. I’ll always give you the most current estimation at the end of our session!

### do you touch-up every image from the session?

Yep! After the initial culling process, every image is post produced with my unique signature style of post-production. This can involve color grading & correction, adjustments to exposure, selective black and white processing, clarity adjustments, tone-mapping, and others.

### what rights do I have to digital prints?

You have the right to print images whenever you want! However, you may not sell your images for profit. tag @bringeroflightphoto in your instagram posts!

### what camera equipment do you use?

My primary camera bodies are Canon R5, and R6 Mark II. My go-to lenses are Canon's f/2.8 70-200, and Canon f/2.8 24-70 & a Godox V1 Flash.

### will you work with my budget?

I wish that I could work with every budget! I truly understand that not everyone can afford the luxury of a photographer. Occasionally, I will try to work within a set budget if I have the date available! If you have a special circumstance, please message me so we can chat more!

### how do you deliver the photos?

The photos will be delivered to your email with a link to your online gallery. I use a site called “Pic-Time” to deliver these. From there, you can download your photos, share the link with friends/family, share to social media, and order prints, and more! You can also opt in for another delivery method, USB drive, disk, etc - let me know in our consultation!

### can I reschedule?

This all depends on my bookings and availability. If at all possible, I’ll do my very best! For my wedding clients, this may be more difficult to do. I’ll be communicating with you through the whole process, and we’ll make it happen! My deposits are non-refundable, as industry standard.
