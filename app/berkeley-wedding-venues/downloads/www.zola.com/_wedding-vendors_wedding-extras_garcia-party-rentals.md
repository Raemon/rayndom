  * ### Canopy and chairs rental

•Verified review

•Luis C.•Jun 27, 2025

Garcia Party Rentals was a wonderful partner for our wedding day. From our very first interaction, they demonstrated a strong connection and understanding of our vision. Their communication style was collaborative, motivating, and productive, which made the planning process seamless. They took the time to understand our budget needs and were incredibly responsive, often replying within a day. The Garcia team proved to be very nice people who went above and beyond to ensure our special day was a success. We are so grateful for their contributions in making our wedding day perfect.

  * ### Amazing company 

•Verified review

•Sophia G.•Jun 27, 2025

Garcia Party Rentals was an outstanding choice for our wedding rentals. From the beginning, their communication was understated yet flexible, and their pricing was very affordable compared to other local vendors. On the day of our wedding, the Garcia team was incredibly organized and arrived promptly to set up all the rentals. Everything looked amazing and exceeded our expectations. We were so impressed by how smoothly the setup went, and our guests raved about the beautiful decor all night long. Garcia Party rentals is highly recommended! Thank you

  * ### Gracias Party Rentals 

•Verified review

•Nancy B.•Jun 27, 2025

Garcia Party Rentals was an excellent choice for our wedding day extras. David, the owner, answered every question I had promptly and with great care. I give him a 10/10 when it comes to decorating and setting things up on time. He left everything set up the whole weekend so we wouldn't be in a rush, which was a huge help. The prices were very affordable and the service was fantastic overall. I highly recommend Garcia Party Rentals for your wedding day needs or any other Special Occasions.
