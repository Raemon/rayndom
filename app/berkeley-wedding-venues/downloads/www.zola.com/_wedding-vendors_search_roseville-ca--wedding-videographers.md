We wanted a cinematic style to capture our day but we also weren’t familiar with the poses nor how to work with a photographer for a full 11 hours. Teddy made it super easy and great to work with him and ask him what we were hoping to get captured on our wedding day. He was communicative, on time, and open to going with the flow as changes came up with our itinerary due to unexpected rain. We got married at our church, took pictures at a nearby garden, and then we traveled 30 minutes to the reception. We definitely recommend him and hope others can have the great experience we had with him!”Itzel H., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/4d5ed45b-0acd-47c7-bc19-98f5bd50ea64?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/lake-full-of-pictures)

  * Cinematic style
  * Serves Roseville, CA

When I first started shooting lots of weddings, I would wake up the next day after a shoot and my wife would ask me how went. “It was insanely cool, and everybody there seemed like SUCH GOOD FOLK,” was a phrase I would almost always use to describe a somewhat ineffable feeling of being surrounded by GOODNESS. Goodness is often found at weddings, and it’s that goodness that we try to find with our cameras, microphones, lights, eyeballs and ears. That's how I came up with the name of my business. Meeting amazing people in beautiful places is what fuels my passion for wedding videography!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“The most important word I can use to describe The Good Fold Film Co. is DOPE. I get so excited whenever I have the opportunity to work with Mauricio and his team because I know the end result is going to be DOPE. TGFFC is professional, communicative, we bounce awesome ideas off each other, and he always finds a way to make the end video totally in sync with the personality of the couple, which, no matter what, is always DOPE. I try to recommend using The Good Folk for every wedding I book. If you're looking for something outside the box, something intimate and personal, and a video you want to watch all the time, The Good Folk Film Co. are your people.”Erin C.

  * Serves Roseville, CA

Where to begin? We have been married on three separate occasions, but never divorced. Courthouse, traditional, and on the beach. In our home caffeine is more valuable than gold, namely to help us keep up with our kids. They’re demons, except I always hear about good deals with demons and our little ones only offer spilled orange juice. Our puppy is no better. Name Lucy (cute right?) after Lucifer, and two cats who are the only stable members of the household. The house is a zoo, but we wouldn’t have it any other way! Jokes aside, we adore our family. It’s as perfectly as imperfect as we could hope for and our journey is only in it’s prologue.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“If you are looking for professional videographers that make movie-like films that are both unique, emotional, and fun, then look no further!

I have to say, our wedding videos are BEYOND. The more we watch them, the more thankful we are to have hired Jesse and his team. Besides the fact that Jesse was so wonderful to work with from our first phone call to the day of our wedding, he is so kind and has amazing attention to detail. He caught everything on our video "wishlist" and gave us some of the best tips before the wedding. He asked for our vows, speeches, and ceremony script ahead of time and then incorporated video shots with special words as they are played. All around, incredible!

They were incredibly kind, helpful, and easy to work with throughout the entire process. Our engagement photos and video were turned around so quickly, within about a week, which was such a nice surprise. Our wedding photos took a bit longer, but it was more than worth the wait. We received over 900 stunning photos along with a 10-minute wedding video, and the quality and editing were absolutely beautiful. The photos are so timeless, truly captured our day perfectly, and we are absolutely obsessed with them. We look at them all the time!! Every image felt thoughtful and beautifully done, and they truly captured the best memories from our day. They were also extremely flexible and accommodating since we were planning from out of state, which made everything feel seamless and stress-free.

I’m Colin Pattison, owner and filmmaker at Featherstone Wedding Films. I film weddings because I believe in the power of marriage, and I have a passion for capturing special moments on film. I’ve helped countless couples create their ideal wedding film for over 10 years. My goal is to capture lasting memories through beautiful, personalized wedding films. From first consultation, to finished film, I’ll be with you every step of the way.“Colin was probably one of the easiest vendors to work with. We chatted on the phone to get to know him, sent him our deposit and that was that! We talked a bit leading up to the wedding, but he and my photographer communicated to get on the same page/ timeline so I didn’t have to stress much about that either. The day of, him and his team were wonderful all day. They themselves were professional, and all his gear was as well. One of the things I appreciated most about Colin was his ability to be everywhere to get footage, but he was secretive about it, so those that are shy on camera didn’t feel pressured. My videos I got were AMAZING. I don’t know how many times we have watched the videos together or how many I’ve watched it alone but, every time feels like the first. It’s beautiful work and truly captured our wedding day and our personalities. We also got raw footage from him that had us cackling. It’s awesome seeing the day again through both the finished product and the raw footage. Thank you Colin for everything. I highly recommend Colin to everyone!!”Aubrey G., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/d109b045-b058-4538-8d42-2fbbe8366a5b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/featherstone-wedding-films)

He was also checking the weather for me, as it was supposed to be raining that weekend, he helped me pick a plan B, in case the location I wanted wouldn’t work, it took a lot of stress off of me, which was so nice. The video he produced is nothing short of breathtaking; it perfectly encapsulates the love and joy of that special day.
