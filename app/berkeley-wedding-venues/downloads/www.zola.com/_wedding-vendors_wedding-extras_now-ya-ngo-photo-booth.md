Now Ya Ngo Photo Booth was a hit at our event! Jeff and the team were super responsive, professional, and easy to work with. The open-concept booth was sleek, and the customizable photo strips were a crowd favorite. High-quality prints and made it unforgettable. Highly recommend!

  * ### Photo Booth / 360 booth 

•Verified review

•Virgelio•Jul 21, 2025

We hired Now Ya Ngo Photo Booth for our daughter’s 1st birthday, and they were truly amazing! The theme was “princess,” and they went above and beyond to match the vibe perfectly—from the custom print design to the elegant setup. It was such a beautiful touch that tied everything together. Our guests couldn’t stop raving about the booth! The kids had a blast, and even the adults were jumping in to take fun photos. The quality of the prints was excellent, and their team was friendly, professional, and super easy to work with. Thank you, Now Ya Ngo, for helping make our little princess’s birthday extra magical. Highly recommend for any event—you won’t be disappointed!
