  * ### Best wedding Planner!

•Verified review

•Michelle A.•Apr 14, 2025

Working with Monica was hands down the best decision we made for our wedding. From our first conversation, she understood our vision and took it to the next level. Every detail—from the breathtaking ceremony setup overlooking the cliffs of Palos Verdes to the flawless timeline and vendor coordination—was executed with such grace and precision. Monica brought calm to the chaos and truly made the day feel magical. Our guests are still talking about how beautiful and seamless everything was. We couldn't have asked for a better planner!

## Frequently asked questions

2 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you also plan other events, like showers or rehearsal dinners?

I plan and design life events such as showers, birthdays and anniversaries too.

### Do you take on multiple weddings in a day or weekend?

I only take one event at a time so I can focus on the main client and not pass them off to anyone else.
