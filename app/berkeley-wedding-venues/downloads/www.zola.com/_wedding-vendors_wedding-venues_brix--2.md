## About this venue

Brix Restaurant and Gardens in Yountville, California opened on March 28, 1996 with a clear focus on providing a farm-to-table dining experience. More than two acres of gardens and orchards provide ingredients for a new menu inspired by the culinary traditions of Northern California, accented by international technique. Owned by the Kelleher family, the restaurant’s name reflects the measurement of sugar levels at which the grapes for the Kelleher Family Vineyard’s Cabernet Sauvignon are harvested.
