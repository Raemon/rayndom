## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### What are the most popular destinations for weddings and honeymoons?

Mexico (Cancun, Cabo, Riviera Maya) and the Caribbean (Jamaica, Dominican Republic, St. Lucia) are top choices for all-inclusive weddings and honeymoons. These destinations offer stunning beaches, luxury resorts, and packages that make planning stress-free.

### How do all-inclusive wedding packages work?

All-inclusive wedding packages bundle everything into one price — venue, food, drinks, décor, and sometimes even photography. A planner customizes the package to match your style and ensures you get the best value without hidden costs.

### Who pays for travel and accommodations at a destination wedding?

Typically, guests pay for their own flights and accommodations. However, planners often negotiate group discounts and room blocks, making travel more affordable for everyone.

### Are destination weddings cheaper than local weddings?

Often, yes. With all-inclusive resorts, you get food, drinks, and décor bundled, which can save thousands. Plus, you combine your wedding + honeymoon in one trip.

### Do I need to be legally married in the destination country?

Not always. Many couples do a quick civil ceremony at home (to handle the legal paperwork) and then have a symbolic ceremony at their destination — this avoids red tape while still giving you the dream wedding.
