Alexander Schmidt was our photographer, and our videographer was Noah. We got our pictures back sooner than expected, and they suited the exact style we had hoped for. Communication was great, photos were easy to access, and we were allowed free download for so many pictures! One family portrait had one person not looking, otherwise people were smiling and looking in everything. Many people commented on their professionalism as well as their kindness at the wedding. Thanks, Eivan's!”Alyssa P., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/66de359b-390d-4921-b500-aaedd3be3b79?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/eivan-s-photo-video)

Pricing: $350/hr | Instagram: Lightfallimagery /// Hello! I’m Victoria and I specialize in wedding, proposal, and boudoir photography. I photograph people all over the world and I am a published photographer. I charge $350/hr or $2,800 for 8 hours with a free engagement or boudoir shoot. Add-ons to my packages can include videography and second shooters. Message me for more details!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“This review is long overdue! Mostly because my wife and I have been 'honeymooning' these past few months but we wanted to also share our experience with Lightfall Imagery for our wedding back in November 2024. Victoria was super professional and showed up on time and was ready to take photos from start time to a little after finish. Unfortunately our other photographer from a different company cancelled on us so she had to work a little harder for us to help fill the role for 2 photographers and she did not dissapoint. My wife and I usually are not photogenic but Victoria helped us to feel relaxed and ourselves throughout our special day. We would absolutely love to work with her again. If you are ever considering a photographer for any occasion, Lightfall Imagery is definitely a choice you can not go wrong with.”Anthony & R., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/3d71b7e2-1887-4913-b7e8-c66615813942?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/vic-schaefer-photography)

I'm a Northern California Wedding Photographer that captures your timeless, romantic wedding moments. I specialize in rustic wedding locations, rural barn setting, coastal weddings, vineyard and winery weddings, and majestic forest groves. Perhaps you are getting married in the city? I have photographed many locations in the middle of San Francisco too. Check out my full portfolio on the website!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Laurie Ann Martin and her team are a fun and professional group to work with. She is detailed oriented and cares not only how the pictures turn out but also your experience. My eyelash came off and I wanted to cry at city hall but she not only made me happy but went to Walgreens to get eye glue lash! That is the type of all hats on board she and her team are. When they had down time before the reception, they even offered to help out non-picture wise wherever they could! She also sends little gifts and surprises but I won’t spoil it. There is one BIG surprise she does at the end but I won’t spoil that either lol. She is fortunately not shy about whether she understands whether things are communicated correctly to her, especially when it comes to the albums - I was quite detailed oriented in what I wanted in my albums and how they were designed _. Her and her teams services are of an immense value and my husband and I had ALOT of fun shooting and videoing with them. Also, the video was really great, really a must. Thank you Laurie and your team!”Tiffany, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/82b8fb3c-f486-4fe1-b258-b05f72719be5?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/laurie-ann-martin-photography)

Aryk Copley Photography 5.0 Santa Rosa, CA

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $4,350 

Welcome! My name is Aryk, I’m a self-taught artist who built my skills from the ground up. My experience in photojournalism and street photography combined with my love of fine art are the foundation of my style. My approach to weddings is that of a documentarian and a witness. My couples are folks who value quality and intimacy, and want their wedding day illustrated with a unique album filled with artful candids, punctuated by breathtaking fine art portraiture.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Aryk is one of a kind. Our wedding was so beautifully captured thanks to them. As a wedding photographer myself, it was important for me to find someone that excelled not just in the technical aspects, but in the overall experience they provide their couples. Aryk always made me and Noah feel comfortable and listened to. They're sensible, communicative, professional, courteous, and always engaged. Always going with the flow, Aryk can adapt to change while still providing excellent results. We appreciated how Aryk's photography method provided us with a one-of-a-kind gallery: a blend of film and digital, all showcasing the genuine emotions I so desperately wanted captured, and in such a beautiful way. Our families and friends are STILL so in awe of the photos we came out with thanks to them.

Jessamyn Harris Photography 5.0

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $4,000 
  * Serves Santa Rosa, CA

I photograph real people in natural light and gorgeous settings, throughout Sonoma & Napa Wine Country, the Bay Area, and beyond. Using humor, connection, and my calm & warm energy, I work with a wide variety of people from all backgrounds and perspectives (even/ especially camera shy folks!). I gently guide couples through very natural moments together, to capture their individual and collective personalities, in the most beautiful, & honest, way possible.“We loved working with Jessamyn for both our engagement photos and our wedding day. Jessamyn has a great spirit and brought a lot to the table - she is both calm and excited, professional and fun, creative and organized. It felt like an old friend was taking our picture which helped make us more comfortable. Our photos turned out absolutely beautiful. She really captured the energy and beauty of our wedding. I'm having trouble deciding which ones to print because we love them all! We look forward to working with Jessamyn for other milestones down the road - new born baby pictures, family photos, etc. My family loved my wedding photos so much my sister booked Jessamyn for her wedding as well.”Dana and G., 6 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/jessamyn-harris)

Hailey Hopkins Photography 5.0

  * Serves Santa Rosa, CA

Hi there! It’s nice to meet you! I’m a lifestyle portrait and wedding photographer here in Santa Rosa, CA and I simply love all things photography. I would say it’s my one true love but that’s not very nice considering I have an amazing husband and three (soon to be FOUR! woah, I know!) incredible kiddos. I can’t imagine life without them. I'm a lover of life and my passion is capturing the big life moments for people that they look at and think, "I'll never forget this...thanks to this photograph!" Ha! Okay, enough about me. Let’s hang out and take some photos that I know you’ll love forever and ever! XOXO“We are absolutely over the moon with our experience working with Hailey! We first worked with her for our engagement shoot, and she immediately made us feel so comfortable in front of the camera. That same ease and warmth carried through on our wedding day, where she made us feel calm, relaxed, and exactly like ourselves. Her ability to capture candid moments and genuine emotions is truly remarkable. She turned around the sneak peek photos incredibly fast, and they are absolutely gorgeous—we can’t stop looking at them! We’re so excited to see the rest of the photos. If you’re looking for a photographer who combines a calming presence with incredible talent, Hailey is the one to book!”Evan T., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/7d49e750-c3b6-4034-b2e0-fc6379f35319?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/hailey-hopkins-photography)

Maison Norde 5.0 Santa Rosa, CA

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $4,000 

Maison Norde is a photography studio devoted to capturing weddings with a calm, cinematic sensibility. We blend film and digital to create imagery that feels textural, emotional, and enduring—rooted in light, intention, and the quiet moments that define a celebration.“We got married at my parents’ property in Santa Rosa, and Daria from Maison Norde captured the day better than we could have imagined. It was a very personal, family-centered wedding, and she fit into it so effortlessly—calm, friendly, and somehow everywhere without ever feeling intrusive. She paid attention to things we didn’t even think about: the way the light moved through the oak trees, my parents bickering over last-something, the little in-between moments when we weren’t aware of the camera at all. Everything feels genuine and beautifully composed without being staged. When we got our gallery, it felt like stepping back into that day- warm, emotional, and honest. We’re so grateful we chose her. I honestly cried at our photos”Polina and I., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/58c39de7-3364-49bb-8c5d-acf17c719aae?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/maison-norde)

  * Serves Santa Rosa, CA

After 10 years and over 200 weddings, I know how to fold into a large group of people, how to be there and make it feel like I'm not. I've been documenting weddings for nearly a decade and I love it even more now than when I started. My work is candid, emotional, and comfortable. I love to infuse editorial and documentary moments into my galleries, but mostly I just love to be able to photograph moments as they unfold.“Melissa was really fun to work with. Claudia was nervous and Melissa helped her feel more at ease. Claudia and I love all the photos she took, the ones she posed us and the ones we improvised.”Claudia + M., 6 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/melissa-atle)

Northern California native, specializing in couples, weddings, and lifestyle photography. My goal is to have fun, and give you an experience you’ll remember for a lifetime! When I began my photography journey, I knew it was something I’d do for the rest of my life. There is something sublime about capturing a moment and being able to hold onto it forever. As we all know—time is fleeting. My passion for this comes alive once I hand over a beautiful piece of your story that you can share for years to come.“Karina did our photography for our wedding in 2021. We had a few pre-meetings with her to discuss our must-haves, the vibe we were going for, and any other details. From the first meeting, I felt like she not only heard us very clearly, she also understood exactly what we wanted and was able to execute our vision perfectly. Come wedding day, she was the picture of professionalism (despite being very pregnant, in 85+ degree heat) and I had not a worry in the world that we would get all of the pictures we wanted. We now have hundreds of incredible photos that we will cherish for the rest of our lives when we remember our day.

Danny Lewis Photography 5.0 Santa Rosa, CA

  * Classic style
  * Starts at $1,600 

Danny Lewis Photography started with a love of photography, of artistry through still images, and of the magic of capturing moments in time through photography. About five years ago I decided to start my journey into professional photography - intitally starting with headshots, family photos, and event photography. After a few years (and second shooting for a few established photographers!), I decided to also include wedding photography and have been doing so ever since. With our experienced team of second shooters, we love making our couples and clients feel relaxed and smiling while we capture all of their wedding's best moments!“We went with Danny Lewis Photography for our wedding earlier this month, and we were so happy with our photos. Danny captured all the best moments of the wedding and was so easy and fun to work with. I will most definitely be hiring him back in the future for our annual family photos because he did such an amazing job with our wedding pictures. The photo booth was a great add-on, and such a big hit! Danny has so many amazing, cute, funny, cool props for the photo booth. Everyone loved the photo booth, it definitely added a ton of fun to our wedding. Thank you for helping make our wedding so memorable, and thank you for capturing our big day!”Kelsey & T., 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/danny-lewis-photography)

Vinh Nguyen Photography Santa Rosa, CA

  * Editorial style

Photography, to me, is more than a mere snapshot; it's a portal that transports us back to the emotions, the laughter, and the whispered secrets of a moment. Over the years, I've come to realize that it's not just about capturing images; it's about encapsulating the very essence of those instances that define us. Each time I press the shutter, I'm not just freezing time; I'm preserving the soul of that moment, ready to be revisited whenever the heart desires.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/vinh-nguyen-photography)

  * Serves Santa Rosa, CA

Welcome. I’ve been a make-up artist, chocolatier, a barista, a pet-sitter, a bartender but I’ve always been “that girl with the camera.” (I’ve also been, “that girl who sleeps on our couch” or “that girl who’s booty I saw in the newspaper” but I digress…). Currently, I base my photography business in Petaluma, CA. I grew up in Sonoma County but in my early 20’s I picked up and moved to Manitoba and that’s where I stayed for many years. Upon my return to CA in 2013 I turned my passion for photography into a career. It’s been a journey to call photography my profession, but I’ve always been a photographer and I’ve always been an artist.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We cannot thank Loren Hasen enough for her outstanding work at our wedding! Loren was incredibly professional, fun, and personable. She seamlessly blended into the background, making it easy to be ourselves without even realizing she was there. The photos Loren took are absolutely stunning. She captured every special moment with skill and creativity, leaving us amazed at the fantastic shots she managed to get. Each photo truly reflects the joy and love of our special day. Loren, your work exceeded our expectations, and we are so grateful for the beautiful memories you've given us.

  * Offer

My name's Meg and I'm an elopement & intimate wedding photographer based in Northern California. I specialize in unhurried, all-day and multi-day adventures throughout Sonoma County, Mendocino, Redwood National Park, and beyond. I help couples create an elopement experience they wouldn't change a thing about with a highly comprehensive planning framework, and deliver photos that they want to show off on every wall.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From our first phone call with Meg, we immediately knew she was the perfect fit for us. We were planning our elopement in California from New York so finding someone that we connected with and trusted without ever meeting was a big risk. But during our call Meg took the time to get to know us as individuals and as a couple, and ever more so after our first call to truly find out what we wanted out of our special day. Along the way she was so helpful with sending suggestions of locations, fun things to do, and once we narrowed it down sent a timeline to keep us on track. The day of our elopement we never felt like she was a pushy photographer like traditional wedding photographers are. She let us enjoy our time together and have those special moments.

Kristen Campbell Photography 5.0

You don’t have to choose between meaningful portraits and actually spending time with your guests. I photograph weddings for couples who value being present with the people they love, while still making time for portraits together. With thoughtful pacing and smart use of natural light, there’s time for both. My approach blends joyful, editorial-style portraits with candid coverage, guided in a way that feels calm and unobtrusive. Outside of winter weddings, there’s usually more flexibility than couples expect, allowing space for portraits and time to enjoy cocktail hour, dinner, and the moments that matter most.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We found Kristen Campbell Photography on Zola and absolutely fell in love! We reached out to Kristen before we even found a wedding planner or chose a date. From the very first interaction, she exceeded our expectations. During our initial consultation, Kristen made us feel so at peace with the decision to hire her to capture our wedding day. She was incredibly transparent about the details and pricing, and the contract process was simple and stress-free! Every vendor we connected with was SO excited when they found out Kristen was capturing our day, and each of them shared how much they loved working with her. Throughout the planning process, Kristen checked in with us regularly, always professional and genuinely excited for our big day. By the time the wedding week arrived, we couldn’t wait to finally meet her in person. Kristen photographed our welcome party and her warm and friendly personality immediately put us at ease. My husband had never taken professional photos before, but she made him feel so confident and guided both of us with clear, easy instructions. She captured our welcome party beautifully and was so gracious and lovely throughout the evening. After that experience, we were even more excited for the wedding day. On our wedding day, Kristen absolutely blew us away. She was timely, organized, and brought so much joy and positivity to the day. Beforehand, she talked through lighting and timing with us, providing recommendations for the best photo locations and schedule. We trusted her completely and were so glad we did—her instincts were spot on! Wedding photos can take time, but Kristen made the process genuinely FUN. Couples' photos, in particular, were one of our favorite parts of the day because of how relaxed and enjoyable she made it. Family and wedding party photos were equally seamless thanks to Kristen’s thorough preparation and attention to detail—she made sure everything was perfectly organized ahead of time. Our family, friends, and wedding party couldn’t stop raving about Kristen. Her positivity and professionalism left such a lasting impression on everyone. She truly brought so much joy to our day, and we are so incredibly grateful for that. While on our honeymoon, we received our sneak peek photos, and WOW—talk about a highlight of the trip! We couldn’t stop looking through them in our hotel room. Kristen delivered so many sneak peeks, and every single one was absolutely stunning. From couples' portraits to candids, family shots, wedding party photos, and intricate details—each image took our breath away. Kristen captured every moment so beautifully, and we’re thrilled with how perfectly she documented the love and joy of our day. The lighting and style of her photography were flawless, but even more than that, we love how genuine each moment feels in her work. Kristen, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We feel so incredibly lucky to have worked with you, and we will cherish these photos for the rest of our lives. Your work is a priceless gift, and we cannot recommend you highly enough!”Erica, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/2e14521d-2af2-4f20-a355-5bf545aa637d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/kristen-campbell-photography)

I’m a wine country native and learned the photographic arts from my family. My early travels and studies in the art & humanities opened my horizons to culture and diversity, plus I'm of mixed ethnicity. I really enjoy photographing weddings, because it has influenced me in a variety of unexpected and good ways. Each wedding has their own uniqueness, personality, and beauty. My life experience in wedding, portrait, & event photography has been a very gratifying and fulfilling journey. I’ve been pro wedding photographer for over 15yrs, and I’m insured.“Marc was so great on our wedding day!! He jumped right into the action, brought humor, creativity and so much energy to every moment. We are so grateful we found him through our venues preferred vendors list. I would highly recommend him to anyone wanting spectacular photos and an all around great vibe.

If you would have known me growing up, you would have been surprised if I didn’t become a photographer! I fell in love with photography after spending countless hours in the darkroom. Since 2008, I have been working professionally in the photography industry and have shot over 300 weddings and numerous other assignments in almost every genre of photography. Why Weddings? I love problem solving and puzzles, and I’m always up for a good challenge. For me, a wedding is a day full of all of the things that I love. Its basically a whole day of coming up with solutions to make the best photographs for my couples.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Lisa and her team were exceptional! We resisted hiring a professional photographer for our wedding for the longest time as we were not convinced that the quality was worth the investment. Boy were we wrong! We could not have been happier with the results and no photos from our family iPhones would have captured the moment like Lisa and Amy. I was drawn to Lisa's storytelling style and how her photos seem to capture the moment. The photos were presented beautifully on our personal gallery and we couldn't have been more proud to share them with our family and friends. We were thrilled that there were so many great photos of our family and friends that they could keep for themselves. You won't go wrong with Lisa and her team and will have photos that you will look back on for many years”Liz, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/lisa-stone-photography)

I am an irreverent guy who just so happens to create beautiful-rich-vibrant-uniquely-authentic wedding photography in and around the Bay Area, all over California and anywhere there’s beautiful light.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We couldn't imagine having a better photographer for our wedding than Russ. He's such a professional, took absolutely stunning photos for us, and got the photos back to us lightning fast. If he's available for your date, book him fast before he's taken! We had previously used Russ for our engagement photoshoot at SF MOMA and loved the way the photos came out. With the pandemic making a full wedding tricky, we chose to switch to a micro-wedding, with a few onsite guests and more on Zoom, down in southern California (Malibu) and Russ agreed to drive down from the Bay Area to shoot it for us. He arrived early and covid safe in an N95 mask. He's great at putting you at ease all day. We also love that he mostly uses a photojournalistic/candid style that documents everything but doesn't get in the way of your wedding with lots of distractions and staged photos. He takes colorful and sharp photos that really capture the moment and make you look great and feel like a moviestar.”Katie + S., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/russ-levi-photography)

I am a Mother, Poet and never-ending dog trainer of my 3 spoiled fur babies. I grew up around photography, my grandfather was a photographer and this has always been something I loved to do. I love people and I have a ton of fun working at events. I am always excited to capture these moments for people and proud to share my results afterward. Photographing people and moments over the years is my true calling in life. Gives me great purpose and I really do enjoy it.“Have you ever met someone you just instantly clicked with? That was meeting Mrs. Opal Prince. From our very first conversation, Opal completely understood my vision--and more impressively, she worked with me through every indecisive moment and my very type B planning style. She never once made me feel underprepared or behind; instead, she offered thoughtful suggestions, filled in the blanks when I couldn't quite articulate something, and genuinely partnered with me every step of the way. We first worked with Opal for our engagement session, which I was admittedly nervous about--especially since my fiancé has a five-minute photo stamina at best. Not only did Opal make the experience comfortable and fun, but she even brought in her husband to help manage our wild dog so we could get a mix of shots with and without him. When I say our pup couldn't have been in better hands with someone we had just met-l mean it. The session was full of laughter, reassurance, and ease, even as our dog did his best to cause chaos. And the photos? They were turned around quickly and completely blew us away. I had several people text me photos of our Save the Dates, amazed by amazed by the stunning pictures Opal captured. Those engagement photos will be treasured for the rest of our lives--and then came the wedding... Opal and her partner, Wing, perfectly captured the energy of the day--Wing with my fiancé and his groomsmen, and Opal with me and my bridesmaids. You can truly feel the personality and emotion, which I fully attribute to the energy they bring. Their calming, friendly presence makes it feel like you're just hanging out with a friend--not posing for a camera. Our wedding day brought its fair share of last-minute weather pivots, and while Opal's role was officially a photographer, she effortlessly became so much more. I found myself turning to her again and again, and every time she was there--calmly helping, offering direction, keeping me on track. Though she was not our coordinator, she filled that role in such a natural way, and I am so grateful for her presence on that day. I can't imagine not having Opal or Wing with us for future milestones. They are the kind of photographers who make even the most camera-shy person feel confident and beautiful, offering clear guidance and capturing magic along the way Book Sweetbay Photography!!!

Daniel Neal Photography has been in business for 17 years in Fairfax California, and specializes in photographing weddings and other celebratory events. He uses an array of naturalistic, traditional, and contemporary styles, blending them together into a beautiful gallery for the couple to relive their wedding day for years to come.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Daniel Neal Photography was the perfect choice for our wedding photographer. From the very beginning, Daniel’s communication was timely, offering helpful advice in a succinct yet friendly manner. On the day of our wedding, he seamlessly blended into the background, capturing ethereal moments that beautifully reflected the love and emotion of our special day. As a DIY bride without a planner, he helped set realistic schedule expectations and put us at ease, so much so that we hardly noticed he was there - except when he made us smile or laugh with his warm, personable approach. The final photos were absolutely stunning, showcasing the loving, intimate feel of our celebration in a way that truly exceeded our expectations. We couldn't be happier with the exceptional service and value provided by Daniel Neal Photography.”Mary G., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/f13143a4-1fae-4e8a-951e-8bdfea8d6b42?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/daniel-neal-photography)

Harrison Boyd Photography 5.0

  * Classic style
  * Starts at $2,500 
  * Serves Santa Rosa, CA

I have been professionally capturing images for over 10 years. During that time, I built a successful promotional marketing company in Canada, received my MBA in Ireland, and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with my wife. My favorite part about photography are the stories that are captured, the frozen moments in time that each picture highlights. Over the course of my career, I have been asked to tell thousands of stories. With the ability to operate in the United States, Canada, and Europe, I’m no stranger to traveling for a good story.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Harrison surpassed our expectations with his close attention to detail, capturing every moment beautifully. We're a slightly awkward couple, but he was professional and made us very comfortable taking our formals after the ceremony. Highly reccommend for those in search of a very talented photographer who is great with people.”Erin & K., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/harrison-boyd-photography)
