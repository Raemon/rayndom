Erica Gravel Design 5.0

  * Serves Modesto, CA

With 8 years and counting of experience in the wedding industry and 5 years specializing in floral design, I bring a seasoned eye for detail and refined artistry to every celebration. My signature style blends luxury with an organic touch, creating floral experiences that feel timeless and unforgettable.“Flowers were one of the most important parts of my daughter’s 2024 wedding, and I cannot express how thankful we are that we chose Erica Gravel Design. From the very first conversation, Erica listened with such care and truly understood how significant the flowers were to us. Her knowledge of the floral world put us at ease throughout the entire process and was quick to explain things about flowers and seasonality that we didnt understand (like peonies!) and offer ideas of substitutes which is so valuable, she felt like a guide hrough the whole process and we were so happy to have someone who was an expert in our corner. On the wedding day, when I walked into the space and saw the flowers, I was overwhelmed, She has an incredible design eye, and it showed in the way she transformed the venue into something magical and unforgettable. We received endless compliments from our guests, many of whom said the florals were the most beautiful they had ever seen at a wedding. My daughter was moved to tears when she saw her bouquet. It was everything she had dreamed of and more. The flowers truly set the tone for the entire day. Erica not only delivered gorgeous florals, but she also made the entire process enjoyable and stress free. Her professionalism, creativity, and dedication are unmatched. We will always remember the role she played in making my daughter’s wedding day as beautiful and meaningful as it was. I cannot recommend her highly enough and would not hesitate to book her again for any event.”Susan N., 5 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/erica-gravel-design)

Their communication style was impeccable - Sarah was always quick to respond to our questions and kept us informed every step of the way. The quality of their work was truly a 10/10. Not only did Sarah execute exactly what she promised, but she was also incredibly easy to work with and incredibly flexible, all while providing great value for the price. Sarah truly felt like a vendor who deeply cared about making our special day perfect. Her attention to detail, talent, and kindness were unmatched, and I would have happily paid an additional 1,000 for her services based on my experience.

Flower Moxie – Do-It-Yourself Wedding Flowers 4.9

  * Starts at $350 
  * Serves Modesto, CA

In 2013, 8-year wedding veteran Amy McCord Jones realizes she wouldn't be able to afford to hire her own floral services if she was a bride. Then, Amy discovers that there is basically zero help available for DIY brides. No flower recipes. No instructions. No access to florist-grade blooms. Rude. So she launches Flower Moxie! Flower Moxie remains a humble, tucked-away small business out of Oklahoma City. We don’t zoom around on scooters in some fancy high-rise. We stock an average kitchen with canned wine and Aldi chips and listen to true crime podcasts while photographing curvy ranunculus. Join us. There’s cake, hugs, and acceptance here.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Flower Moxie was a great floral vendor. Their wide range of diy tutorials was very helpful, and our florist helped us form a vision for our wedding flowers. We were very happy with how our flowers turned out, and proud we could have a hand in diy-ing this aspect of our wedding.”Elizabeth A., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/2dc097e1-7abe-4b3c-9fec-494d302f3b50?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/flower-moxie)

We got a quote for real flowers to start and it was way out of our budget. When we started looking for 'fake' flowers, I knew I wanted them to look as real as possible. I must have looked at 10 different vendors across CT and MA, and as soon as I saw Wood & Word Blooms website I was sold! Her bouquets are one of a kind, each and every piece was perfect for our wedding. She was so supportive and helpful in the color picking process, I changed my mind a few times but she never batted an eye. She got us to the finish line and we couldn't be happier.

Her creativity and energy are unmatched, and you can tell she genuinely loves what she does. Stephanie was always prompt and professional, showing up on time and prepared, which helped the entire process run smoothly and gave me such peace of mind on the big day.

Each arrangement was thoughtfully designed and perfectly coordinated to our color palette and theme. The florals tied everything together and made the entire space feel magical. What really stood out to me was how collaborative and communicative Stephanie was throughout the whole process. She took the time to understand what I wanted and offered ideas that aligned beautifully with my vision. Her passion, attention to detail, and artistic talent truly shine in her work.

From her professionalism down to her attention to detail, there was not a single step of the planning process that we were not completely blown away by Autumn and her work! During the early phases of our wedding planning process, we had received 6 different floral proposals from various florists local to the Bay Area. Autumn's proposal blew every other company's out of the water! Coming in at 20 pages, her proposal outlined our color pallet and inspo photos for the conceptual design, the exact flowers (with pictures) she chose based on our vision, the exact vessels, candles, and candle holders she had in mind, and pricing for each bouquet, boutonniere, and arrangement. Shortly after receiving her proposal, and prior to making our final decision on florist, I flew into San Fran on a last-minute work trip. I reached out to her literally as I was touching down at SFO to see if she was available to meet at our venue to go over design and vision. Autumn immediately dropped everything and met me on site within an hour! That alone earned our business - she was committed to us and our vision from the very beginning. Throughout the planning process, Autumn ensured my husband I stayed involved in the decision making process, regularly sending options for different vessels, candles, candle holders, ribbon selections, and design preferences. On the week of the wedding, she asked if I would like updates as she arranged our florals to which I said OF COURSE! Daily she sent me the sweetest photos and videos of the bouquets, aisle arch, etc. which was the shining light pulling me through an incredibly stressful and busy final week of planning/travel! We truly cannot speak highly enough about Autumn, her amazing work, her attention to detail, and professionalism throughout the entire process! Our wedding day went off without a hitch and it was SO FUN seeing her on the day of our wedding after 2 years of planning together!

Choose one of our DIY flower kits or get a custom plan based on your colors, style, and budget.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“The flowers (on our order) came in large boxes, but they were not labeled, so it took a minute to get the flowers both identified and properly set up. To be fair we were warned about the process, but not about the length of time due to our inexperience. As a note, it took my fiancé 5 hours to process the flowers when first receiving them. I also did not have any updates from them from the time I ordered till they were being shipped. They were beyond more affordable compared to other florists, and the flowers arrived alive and in good spirits. We were able to keep the flowers alive for over four days!! Many of the flowers that we chose did not have specific instructions, so we had to follow the general reference for the flowers and hope for the best. Additionally, some of the flowers that we wanted were not in stock, and they were replaced for us with substitutes but were not notified until we had all of the flowers already delivered to us. Also, as a note, bloom culture uses third party sellers for their flowers, so the quality may vary depending on location. Our flowers were in good condition, and the company we had clearly took good care of the flowers prior to delivering them to us. Would we do it again? Probably not, but it made for good laughs and bonding time and we have stories to tell from it!”Hannah H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/36a6f8b7-2bac-47a0-89d6-63ff0d0d678c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/bloom-culture-flowers)

My mission is to create stunning, high-quality floral arrangements that not only delight the eyes but also touch the heart. I aim to craft beautiful, meaningful spaces that reflect your unique story and celebrate life’s extraordinary moments with beauty and significance, all while offering great value to every client. Thank you for considering Fanfare Florals.

If you’ve stumbled upon her page, take this as your sign: you’ve found your florist. She was one of my favorite vendors to work with leading up to and on the big day. Fan was willing to work with me within my budget and make my dream come to life. Her attention to detail is unmatched. I didn’t have a planner and was juggling countless little things, but with Fan, I felt completely at ease. She anticipated details I never would have thought of like timing the placement of eucalyptus runners so they wouldn’t burn in the sun, which made all the difference. She was also incredibly patient as we decided on my bouquet. I was very particular, and she went above and beyond, even coordinating with three different vendors to get it perfect. The end result was stunning, and I received endless compliments on the flowers all night long. Her pricing is also competitive and probably the best for the level of quality she delivers.

She is an incredible wedding and event planner and a gifted florist with an exceptional eye for design and detail. I had a very specific vision for my dream wedding—which included multiple venues and complex logistics—and Yulia brought it all to life beautifully. From assembling an amazing team of photographers, makeup artists, and videographers, to coordinating every detail on the day-of, she handled everything with grace and precision. She created and delivered the most stunning floral arrangements, and cleverly designed them to be used across multiple locations (ceremony and reception). She even handcrafted my seating labels and added thoughtful, personal touches throughout the event. I was able to fully enjoy the day knowing she had everything handled. Beyond my wedding, Yulia also planned my baby shower and continues to be my go-to for beautiful floral arrangements. I'm pretty indecisive, so having her as a thought partner throughout the wedding process was a lifesaver—she helped me make key decisions with confidence and was always available to text, brainstorm, and support. Yulia goes above and beyond for her clients, and I truly could not have done it without her.
