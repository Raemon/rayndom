Hi! I’m Riz, the calligrapher and artist behind Ellestrations, a Filipina-owned creative studio based in the Bay Area. My love for typography began in grade school, and over the years, that early fascination has evolved into a passion for handlettering and a commitment to the art of calligraphy. ​ At Ellestrations, I specialize in creating custom handlettered signage for life’s most meaningful moments—everything from welcome signs and seating charts to escort cards and station signs. Whether you're planning a wedding, a special event, or simply want to elevate your space with a personal touch, I’m here to help bring your vision to life.

Intimately hand lettered signage tailored to your event. I find it incredibly rewarding to contribute to the joy of others through my work. Each project is a true collaboration—I take the time to understand your style and needs, and work closely with you until every detail is just right. I value integrity, clear communication, and craftsmanship, and I pour intention and care into every piece I create.

**In three words:** Collaborative, Flexible, Practical

  * ### The best work from the best artist 

•Verified review

•Sarai•Nov 4, 2025

I was lucky enough to work with Ellestrations for my wedding. I was doing most things myself and she wanted to help bring my vision of my seating chart to life and with little direction she created a beautiful masterpiece that was more than I could have asked for. Many of my guests were very impressed especially because she did it all by hand. Hire her! Her work is amazing and she’s amazing to work with. Don’t sleep on her or you’ll miss out.

  * ### Wedding Signage 

•Verified review

•Lauren R.•Oct 29, 2025

Ellestrations was an absolute joy to work with for our wedding! From the moment we reached out, their communication was prompt, clear, and easy-going. As someone who lacks creativity, I felt so fortunate to have found a vendor that could bring my vision to life in such a detailed and unique way. She created a seating chart that was incredibly helpful for our guests, and the welcome sign she designed was exactly how we had envisioned it. Ellestrations truly took the stress out of those key elements and allowed us to focus on enjoying our special day. I would highly recommend them to any couple looking for a reliable and talented event extras vendor.

  * ### Newlywed Portrait

•Verified review

•Riahna B.•Oct 28, 2025

We asked Ellestrations to create a wedding portrait of our couple with his late mother. She did a beautiful job and we loved gifting it to them as a surprise to come home to after their trip. She communicated with us promptly on any edits we might have and was very transparent about the process and turnaround time. Can’t wait to request another service!
