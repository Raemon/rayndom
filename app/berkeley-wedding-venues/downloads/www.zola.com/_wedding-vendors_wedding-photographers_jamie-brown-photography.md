I'm Jamie! I help couples tell their love story through timeless and romantic images & heirlooms. I am a true California girl, mama, and beach lover. My goal is to create timeless and beautiful images that will be treasured for years to come. I truly believe that each person deserves to have images that capture the people and events that you never want to forget. I hope you choose me to document your life and I look forward to meeting you.

My philosophy is simple. I take beautiful images to remember your special day. The moments and looks that you'll want to cherish forever. The ones that you'll frame in your home for years to come. each session is tailored to your vision and capturing what is most important to you. My goal is to create art that will last from generation to generation. I want each session to be memorable, fun, effortless, and stress free. I want to hear all about your dream wedding!

  * ### Jamie Is the BEST!

•Verified review

•Ashley Prescott P.•Jul 16, 2021

Jamie Brown is the best to work with. She is professional and talented and makes you feel so comfortable. She has a really good eye and I love working with her every time I get the opportunity. I've been lucky enough to work with her both as a wedding vendor AND as a wedding couple. If I could give a million stars... I WOULD!

  * ### Highly Recommended!

•Verified review

•Danny & R.•Jul 13, 2021

Jamie was a pleasure to work with. We had the opportunity to take both our engagement and wedding photos with her. We loved how both turned out! Jamie made us feel comfortable, was great at giving directions, and open to our ideas. Her creativity and passion shine through in the finished product.
