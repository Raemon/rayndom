With all the energy and hype of a live band and the flexibility of a DJ, you won’t have to decide between hiring a band or a DJ for your next event or wedding.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Stop your search right here, Golden Bell is what you're looking for. Marlon and the team absolutely brought the vibes and all of our guests won't stop talking about them. Before our wedding day, Marlon was super attentive, responsive, and overall fun to work with. He really went out of his way to ensure our entire day went exactly as we envisioned. The energy of the live band combined with the well-mixed playlist certainly kept people entertained the whole party, and the dance floor stayed packed the entire night. We can not think of one thing that Golden Bell could have done better. They have our highest recommendation.”Audrey, 19 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/9041d898-59bf-4221-b17e-164891df1240?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/golden-bell-music)

He worked flawlessly with me, my partner, and our wedding planner to pull off an incredibly fun reception. Richard did an initial call with my partner to discuss the general vibe we were looking for, and we knew immediately he would be a great fit for our wedding. Richard gave us a helpful questionnaire to fill out key songs and general musical interests (and do not play songs). Richard was also happy to jump on calls with us to talk through our questions and hopes for our big day. I especially appreciated that Richard was able to play some German songs for some guests who had flown in from Germany, as that got even some of our older relatives on the dance floor. People were partying all night thanks to Richard! Richard catered to our wide age range of guests, and even gave us a couple of bonus closing songs that were the perfect conclusion to the night. We could not have asked for a better DJ.”Chelsea P., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4115ccdf-dcf7-4cb9-8ac6-65414450fe8a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/all-ears-dj)

  * DJ
  * Starts at $1,700 

We’re Anthony and Brian, friends since kindergarten, who started sharing our passion for music in high school. What started as mixing at small house parties soon evolved to spinning at bars, clubs, private events, and weddings. With over 20 years of experience we thrive on the thrill of playing the perfect song at just the right moment to keep the energy alive and the party going!“Hands down THE. BEST. DJs. IN. THE. BAY! Honestly, maybe anywhere?! If you are looking for DJs who bring high quality sound, can read the crowd's energy, mix music seamlessly, and provide excellent customer service, then seriously look no further! Rhythmix Sounds is going to bring the party atmosphere and keep it going! We booked Rhythmix Sounds in 2019 at the recommendation of a friend of a friend, and Brian was our main point of contact. Unfortunately, we were one of the OG covid weddings that got postponed to 2022 and so we had been waiting with bated breath to dance at our wedding reception/"reception anniversary" and to listen to Rhythmix Sounds' audio skillz! The sound: The sound was excellent, both indoor and outdoor. One thing that often gets overlooked is the audio at the ceremony. I think it's imperative that your guests can hear the officiant and especially your vows to each other. That's why your guests are there! I don't even know how it was all set up but the lapel mic (and the whole setup) was perfect. Transitioning to the reception, the announcements and music were crisp. The music: Brian gave me a spreadsheet to list any songs for the ceremony, cocktail hour and reception. It was comprehensive, asking for any specific songs for the walk down the aisle, to the first dances, and any other special moments (and of course, any do-not-play songs). I only had a few specific songs for those items, and otherwise gave Rhythmix Sounds a sense of the music artists/vibes that we were looking for, and they knocked it out of the park! Like I mentioned above, they read the crowd on the dance floor so well, and just knew what songs to play to keep the energy up and the crowd on the dance floor, and when to transition to the next one. They catered to all tastes and all ages, and somehow chose songs that pleased everyone! I would be outside saying goodbye to wedding guests, and Rhythmix Sounds would play a song, and I'd have to excuse myself and quickly get myself back to the dance floor! The cost: Honestly, they brought so much value to us on our wedding day, so I think the price is super reasonable and worth it. I did not have to worry about anything related to the sound and the music on the day of, and you can't buy that kind of peace of mind. Don't hesitate! Book them now!”Karen, a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/rhythmix-sound-lighting)

I’ve been playing weddings for over twelve years and I love my work! My services cover any or all aspects of wedding & receptions. I have found my life’s artistic calling in becoming flexible to every type of music my clients could desire. I learn to enjoy whatever my clients love and this resonance makes my job sustainable and ever-enjoyable. But, I do tend to request the ability to make choices for the dance-floor that rely on my years of dance-enhancing experience. I meet with my clients to determine what music they would love to hear and what music they do NOT want to hear.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We’d experienced some strange DJ moments at other weddings - airhorns, over the top transitions, self advertising - so we were feeling picky as we embarked on the first DJ search of our own. Celebration DJ stood out to us, and the ability to hire a DJ who can also sing and play guitar was an enticing combo. Brandon did a fabulous job bringing his professional experience to the day - we really wanted a packed dance floor and he delivered. The photobooth and its quirky props were a huge hit with our guests, and the GIFs that were available afterwards are so fun and unique! We also loved that we could collaborate on playlists via Spotify - made it easy and now we can continue to listen to our wedding music for years to come. Thank you Brandon and the Celebration DJ team!”The H., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/a2b1a39c-7b12-43f7-8a8e-39512c93130b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/the-celebration-dj)

He was an excellent MC & he truly helped us plan our program out. We had no idea what we wanted as far as a “program,” but he didn’t hesitate to help us create a nice little timeline for our reception! Ardi also took the time to meet with us Via zoom prior to the wedding, to plan out the timeline & also discuss music of course! He provided all the vibes & played us exactly what we wanted. Our guests LOVED the old r&b love songs during dinner, I loved seeing everyone’s faces when he’d play certain songs! The custom light add-ons are definitely worth it too!

NODJNOPARTY Entertainment | DJ TNT Turning Moments into Memories — One Beat at a Time With over 17 years of professional experience, DJ TNT is more than just a DJ—he’s a vibe curator, energy architect, and celebration expert. Trained by his late father, the legendary DJ TeddyB, music is in his DNA. Every beat he drops carries a legacy of passion, precision, and pure joy.“Trecee was our DJ for our outdoor wedding reception, and he was amazing! My husband and I were originally going to just play music from our phone, but I’m glad that we found and hired Trecee instead! With no coordinator and last minute changes before and on the day of our wedding, Trecee remained professional, flexible, and fun as our DJ and MC! He followed our song cue list wonderfully, and helped us remix our first dance songs just how we planned. He made announcements we had set on the schedule as well as additional ones requested. He also made funny comments, which totally added to the vibes. His music choices were just what we were looking for, and even with a request by my family to switch to slower songs, he did it seamlessly; Fun, hyped songs for the younger crowd and romantic songs for the elders. He arrived about 45 minutes before his contract hours started to set up and even gave us (bridal party) warnings and updates on getting behind or on track of schedule! (Which is very helpful as, again, we didn’t have a coordinator.) Overall, he is a great DJ & MC, and my now husband and I would highly recommend his services! I will post more pictures once available.”Midore Q., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/341dab4a-cfbb-4dd1-9919-18e66626d0fc?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/nodjnoparty-entertainment)

The Cosmo Alleycats 5.0

  * Band or Ensemble
  * Starts at $5,000 
  * Serves San Ramon, CA

The Cosmo Alleycats is a San Francisco-based Swing & Vintage Dance Band that has been a popular choice with wedding couples, event planners, dancers and audiences for the last decade. The band, comprised of 6 talented musicians, draws from several decades of exhilarating American dance music to deliver a fun and engaging performance with a dynamic, soulful delivery.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We hired the Cosmo Alleycats for our wedding and it was by far one of the best choices we made. Working with Emily and the Cosmo Alleycats is a dream. First up, they are obviously very musically talented - their style is fun for everyone of all ages and they are open to working with you for your preferences. They went above and beyond by making a special arrangement of our first dance song. We wanted to practice dancing to their rendition before the big day, so Emily shared a recording of it with us which was extremely helpful. Emily is a true professional, helping us organize all of the details and logistics in addition to emceeing for the evening and bringing her gorgeous singing voice, and each member of the band brings their own talents and flair. I cannot recommend them enough. Live music at a wedding is a top-notch experience for you and your guests and you won’t regret hiring the Cosmo Alleycats for your special day.”Emily M., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/e48eb542-686c-461c-9b36-5beb6e211fbc?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/the-cosmo-alleycats)

But even amongst live bands, Garuda Blue is just top of the top composed of jazz musicians who all have their own flair and soul to their music. Their music is original and never the same and having them play at our wedding may have been the single best choice. From cocktail hours to dancing, the live instruments and absolutely stunning vocalist makes you really feel like you are at somewhere special. They’re also absolutely professional and kind and personable. I can’t say enough good things about them. Yes if you get a dj it’s cheaper, but you will miss out on a magical night filled with real music and what is life without real music. Don’t hesitate to think if it’s worth it or not because real great live music can transform an ordinary event to a magical one.”Sam, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/34270853-958b-433a-9bb4-f2a200f4264e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/garuda-blue)

Bay Area Strings did not disappoint. Jen Mathers was highly responsive during the process and very easy to communicate throughout the planning process, which goes a long way. She provided us with a list of songs the group would be able to play for us, samples of performances, and a list of options for ensemble. We chose a string quartet and the pricing was very reasonable. We had requested a song that wasn't on the playlist and Jen had the ensemble learn the sheet music - beyond thrilled! The music was breathtaking and our wedding ceremony would not have been the same without the group's performance. Looking back at our wedding day, the live music is something we will always remember, thanks to Jen and Bay Area Strings.”John & E., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/bay-area-strings)

When good isn’t good enough and your worst fear is getting that cheesy DJ that your guests don’t like or won’t remember, Sounds Elevated is here to help!“This review for Zeb (and the whole Sounds Elevated Team) is long overdue. Zeb is not only an incredible musician in his own right but plays the role of musical conductor with equal panache. A true “Jack of All Trades.” Some of the many hats he wore for our wedding include: -He played solo guitar for our ceremony -Lined up a jazz quartet for the happy hour -Setup the party lighting (party but classy) for the reception -Setup a photo booth for guests to take fun photos (a big hit btw) -DJ’d with a live accompaniment combo for the reception \- stayed up way later than we asked him to, and DJ our afterparty (which was a VERY different vibe than the reception). He was hustling for easily 10 hours straight. And every single element he contributed to the festivities was top tier. My older cousin, a professional musician for many years, was blown away by the level of talent. It’s been almost two years since the wedding and we still get compliments about the entertainment. He and his team went above and beyond. Easily the best “value” for anything we spent money on for the wedding. I strongly recommend meeting with Zeb and gearing his philosophy/approach to weddings/events.”Kelsey D., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/sounds-elevated)

The whole team, from the lead singers to the sound and light techs, was amazing to work with. Every step of the way they were courteous, on top of the details, and available to hop on a Zoom or respond to an email with our venue and our wedding planner. They took it upon themselves to make sure power and sound were all taken care of *and* they even tried to make sure we had tenting for the outdoor wedding (it wasn't even their job) just to take a load off of our plate. I'd hire this band again and again, and, if they'll do it for our 5 or 10 year wedding anniversary. Thanks!”Cat & J., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/ruby-wedding-party-band)

Dj Airsun Aka Ersson Bartle. It’s not a party if people don’t dance. DJ Airsun has been putting people in the mood to groove at parties, events, and clubs since 2011. Airsun’s experience spinning for diverse groups with different tastes means the dancing at weddings and private parties is always a blast and always curated for the people of the hour. “Whether it’s Latin or country, or hip hop or electronic, getting to learn the different styles through new clients, there’s always something new.” Airsun is fluent in an open format, commanding popular music of all eras and styles, so guests of all ages want to get on up and shake it on down.“AJ Airsun did an absolutely wonderful job DJing our wedding and was lovely to work with from start to finish - I would absolutely recommend her to anyone! We wanted a dance party, with songs that get everyone up and moving and she definitely delivered. The setup was perfect, even with the ceremony and reception in two different places (one of which was an outdoor park - they tucked the setup behind a tree!), and included really tasteful and fun mood lighting. My husband even told me about a couple last second changes (adding a new song to the processional while we were all lined up ready to go, and wrapping up one of the dances a little early) that she executed perfectly in the moment. Our reception was at the Outdoor Art Club in Mill Valley - a historic building and small town that both have a lot of rules about sound levels, and it all went perfectly while still feeling like a high energy dance party. We can’t thank Ersson enough!”Christina B., 9 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/airsun-productions)
