## About Ceremonies For Sacred Days

### Ceremonies For Sacred Days

Officiant

Get a quote

I collaborate with the wedding couple to design and write a deeply personal custom wedding script and then coach their designated officiant to deliver it with ease and joy. After officiating over 600 ceremonies, I am now collaborating with couples to design and write their wedding ceremony and then coaching a friend or family member to deliver it with ease and joy. Over half the weddings in the United States are now performed by family or friends because it creates tremendous warmth and intimacy in the ceremony. However, asking someone to write and officiate a complete wedding ceremony can be overwhelming if they have never done it before.
