I have worked every aspect of the event planning and floral industry for over a decade. Aa a Bay Area local, I’ve apprenticed with local bakers, caterers, florists, and event coordinators since the age of 16. I’ve always been drawn to work with my hands, work with beautiful materials, and celebrating the opportunity to bring joy into others lives.

I love creating arrangements with a natural feel, that are loose, wild, and free. I always strive to make an original, lovely statement around bursts of color to compliment both the person and the occasion. In other words, I try, with every snip, to capture a bit of nature’s beauty in a handful of flowers.

Olivia did an incredible job as our wedding florist! We hired her based on her portfolio and were not at all disappointed! She was a wonderful communicator and met with us multiple times via zoom to make sure we were on the same page. She was timely and professional, with a perfect balance of friendliness and ease to work with, both in the meetings and in person! She was kind and worked around us while we were sharing the same space to set up the day before. 10/10 - highly recommend!! If we every need another florist for an event, we will use her again!

  * ### Made our dreams come true

•Verified review

•Whitney F.•Jun 28, 2021

Olivia was a pure joy to work with for our wedding! We had to turn our 200 person wedding to a backyard wedding during Covid, and Olivia made the transition so seamless and easy for us! Not only is she professional, but she is the nicest person to work with, and never made my floral ideas feel weird or wrong. On the day of our wedding, Olivia worked tirelessly to make the backyard into the wedding venue of our dreams! I walked outside and immediately started crying because she knew my vision better than I could even put into words when we were planning. Her flowers turned my wedding into a magical space and I will forever be grateful. I could not recommend Olivia enough, and your experience working with her will be nothing less than a pleasure!

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### Can you provide any decor other than flowers?

Yes! We offer a variety of rentals for an additional cost from aisle runners to candelabras, arches, candles, mirrors, and more. Get in touch to see our full list.

### What is your service area? Do you have a delivery fee for flowers?

We offer delivery, setup, and breakdown services within a 50 mile radius of Lafayette . We have a $2,500 minimum for floral delivery (and $1,000 minimum for pickup). Since many weddings require a professional set up, we also charge a separate fee for event installation.

### Do you have a minimum spend for weddings?

We have a $2,000 minimum for custom floral pieces. We also offer a complete wedding package starting at $495 with pre-selected flower types and quantities.

### How far in advance should we order our wedding flowers?

It’s never too early to get in touch about your wedding, but we recommend having a few details figured out before you do. For example: Have you selected the location for your ceremony and/or reception? What’s your wedding style? Do you know how many guests you’ll be expecting? Typically, our couples reach out around 6 to 8 months before their big day.

### Do you handle flower breakdown after the ceremony?

Yes, we offer breakdown services along with delivery, set up, and flower transfer from the ceremony to the reception.
