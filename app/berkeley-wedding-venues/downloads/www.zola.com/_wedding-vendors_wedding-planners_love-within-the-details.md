I cannot express how much you need Sandra in your life. I am extremely type A and organized and I couldn't believe how much I didn't think about. The questions she asks, the moments and details she thinks about that I hadn't even considered. The planing program she has is AMAZING for seating charts, keeping track of budgeting. I loved how task oriented she is; after each of our meetings I would walk away with a checklist and timeline so I knew what and when I needed things done, and I would just send it her way and she would work her magic. She is so organized, on top of it, creative, responsive, and fun!! I literally didn't have to worry about anything the day of. I even learned after the fact that there was some guest drama with this seating chart and she and my sister handled it and I didn't even know about it!! Truly worth every single cent. I would prioritize Love With in the Details in your wedding budgeting because it is TRULY WORTH IT!! I can not recommend Sandra and her team highly enough.

  * ### The best planner we could have hoped for!

•Verified review

•Gabriella S.•Oct 15, 2025

Working with Sandra Cooper (Love Within the Details) was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. From the very beginning, Sandra stood out—not just for her warmth and professionalism, but for her deep experience, creativity, and attention to detail. She is truly incredible. We are so grateful for Sandra—she not only made our wedding day fabulous and beautiful, but she was also such a steady encouraging guide throughout the whole planning process. We had an at-home wedding and initially thought we just needed just a day-of coordinator. When we spoke to Sandra, she encouraged us to bring on a part- or full-time planner—she was clear (in the most respectful way) about what it actually takes to pull off a successful at-home wedding. She also wouldn’t even move forward with us until she had visited the property to feel confident that our vision was achievable. Her honesty, thoughtfulness, and professionalism at this early stage really won us over. Sandra’s past life as a CPA definitely shows—she is on it when it comes to the details. She has a unique ability to hold both the big picture and the small stuff in perfect balance, kept us super organized along the way, and thought of truly everything. Beyond her excellent event execution, Sandra also has great style and a creative eye—she really understood our vision and had such fun, unique suggestions along the way. Sandra was also a supportive partner throughout the planning process—Sandra kept us grounded, helped us make decisions, and held us lovingly accountable when we started to second-guess ourselves (we’re still grateful she talked us into sticking with the blue tablecloths!). And on the wedding weekend, Sandra was calm and focused yet adaptable in the face of unforeseen challenges. For example, a few hours before our welcome party, there was a change in the weather and we needed to switch locations at our venue. Sandra handled everything herself and simply kept us updated along the way, and it even turned out better than the original plan! Another example, the train of my wedding dress ripped and was causing issues before guests arrived at cocktail hour. Sandra calmly used a sew gun to reattach the train, without elevating anyone’s stress level. These examples capture everything about who Sandra is: unshakeable, solutions-oriented, and deeply committed to making sure the day feels joyful and seamless for everyone involved. Sandra was so much more than a planner—she was a partner, a coach, a fixer, a guide, and a friend. If you’re planning a wedding—especially an at-home one—you want Sandra in your corner. Full stop.

  * ### Our Big Day in Cool, CA

•Verified review

•Bardea & K.•Jul 24, 2025

My wife and I were able to find the most perfect venue to celebrate our special day at Black Oak Mountain vineyards. This is where we were introduced to Sandra and we couldn’t have hit more of a home run with her as our wedding planner. We didn’t fully understand what it took to plan a wedding and I can confidently say we would’ve been completely lost without Sandra. She is detail oriented, creative, proactive, and was able to give us our dream wedding through a collaborative year long planning. Sandra was always available and alleviated all of the stress that goes into planing a wedding. My wife and I had bits and pieces of a vision we had for our big day which Sandra was able to bring to life. Sandra coordinated with our vendors, created a schedule, and made our big day stress free. We loved that we were able to enjoy the day and spend time with our guests because of how well planned and timely everything was. Our guests raved about the little details, food, and amazing night of partying. Truly a night that we will never forget and we wouldn’t have been able to do it without Sandra and her team. Pairing the most perfect venue with the most amazing planner made for a dream wedding. We would highly recommend utilizing LWTD for your big day. Thank you Sandra, we will never forget how truly amazing our day was thanks to you!

  * ### Highly Recommend Sandra and Her Team!

•Verified review

•Katelin S.•Jun 10, 2025

If you’re looking for a wedding planner, look no further—you’ve hit the jackpot! We worked with Sandra for about a year leading up to our wedding, and from the first phone call to the last detail she was a joy to work with. Throughout the entirety of the planning process she was thoughtful, organized, and went above and beyond to make our vision come to life. Sandra is truly a professional and expert in her job. Her endless resources, monthly planning meetings, and knowledge of the wedding industry truly made our wedding the best day it could be. Looking back I couldn’t imagine planning a wedding without her. She entertained every idea we brought to the table, and really tried to make every vision we had come to life. That being said, she also was honest when she had other thoughts, and suggested ideas that were even better. Some of the best parts of our day were because we listened to her judgment and expertise. On our wedding day, I hardly felt any stress because I knew that everything behind the scenes was being taken care of. Because of that we were fully able to enjoy our day and focus on each other and our guests. Not a lot of people can say that about their wedding! Our guests noticed too—so many people commented on how seamless, meaningful, and well-organized the day felt. Sandra made what could have been a stressful year of planning feel fun, exciting, and totally manageable. We’re beyond grateful for everything she did for us and couldn’t recommend her more highly. If you're lucky enough to work with her, you're in great hands.
