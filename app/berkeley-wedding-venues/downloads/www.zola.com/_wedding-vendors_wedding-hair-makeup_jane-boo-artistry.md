  * ### The best! 

•Verified review

•Catrine•Jun 30, 2025

I booked Jane for makeup and Katya for hair for my wedding day, and they were absolutely incredible. Jane created the most stunning makeup look for me - I truly felt like the best version of myself. She also did makeup for six members of my bridal party, and everyone looked flawless and still felt like themselves. Katya was just as amazing - she styled completely different hairstyles for each bridesmaid, exactly as we requested, and nailed every single one. My bridal hair turned out better than I imagined. They worked together as a true dream team - calm, professional, and so fun to be around. They made our morning stress-free and beautiful. I couldn’t have asked for better artists on my big day.

•Daniella•May 8, 2025

Jane was amazing to work with on my wedding day. She did both my makeup and hair, really listened to what I wanted, and made sure I felt like myself - just a more polished version. My makeup looked natural in person and in photos, and my hair stayed in place the whole day and night. She was calm, professional, and super easy to be around - which really helped during such a busy morning. I’d definitely recommend her to any bride who wants to feel confident and comfortable.
