### Do you also do hair?

Unfortunately I don’t do hair, however I do have a team of bridal hair/stylist that I work with regularly.

Yes! I’ve been doing makeup for over 22 years and have worked on all different races, colors, and backgrounds.

### Do you travel?

### Do you require a deposit?

Yes. A non refundable deposit is required to book and secure your date. Once deposit is received, a contract agreement will be in place for both parties to sign.

Absolutely not. 70% of my clients prefer to move forward without a trial. I do recommend a trial prior to the big day, however it isn’t mandatory.

### Do you offer trials or consultation?

Yes! I always recommend doing a bridal trial at least a few months prior to the big day.

### Do you handle large bridal groups?

Yes! Depending on timeline, I can do 6-8 people by myself. If time is limited and the getting ready window is small, I can bring additional artist/s if needed. There is a $100 extra artist fee.

Melissa was incredible to work with for my wedding day! From the very beginning, Melissa was super nice and an absolute pleasure to communicate with. She has a wonderful way of getting along with everyone and truly listens to understand exactly what you want. For the price, Melissa's work is phenomenal - she can easily accommodate any skin texture issues and deliver flawless makeup that lasts all night. I would book Melissa again in a heartbeat and cannot recommend her highly enough!

  * ### Absolutely Amazing! 

•Verified review

•Cristina H.•Aug 10, 2025

She did an amazing job! I wasn’t even sure I wanted to get my makeup professionally done but I am so glad that I did! She was great from start to finish. She was patient and asked clarifying questions on what you wanted and then executed it perfectly. My makeup was everything I wanted plus more! It was perfect and lasted all day! Literally! My wedding was at 9am and I even took a midday nap and when I woke up it was still perfect!! If you are wondering if you should get your makeup done, DO IT! Especially with Melissa! She was awesome and I will always recommend her.

•Maria•Jul 20, 2025

Melissa Oliveira Artistry was an exceptional choice for our wedding beauty needs. From the start, Melissa's communication was responsive, clear, and incredibly helpful. During the makeup trial, she worked closely with me to understand my preferences and create a look that I felt confident and beautiful in. On the wedding day, Melissa's calm and professional demeanor helped put me at ease, and the final makeup was absolute perfection - it lasted flawlessly from start to finish. My mom and best friend were also thrilled with their makeup, which Melissa customized to their individual styles. I'm so grateful I chose Melissa, as she truly contributed to making our special day feel even more perfect.
