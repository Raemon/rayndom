I'm Katherine, a wedding photographer based in Oakland, CA. With over a decade of experience and features in Vogue, Brides, The New York Times, and more, I know how to create wedding photos that don’t just look stunning — they feel like you. No trendy filters, no forced poses, just authentic moments that reflect who you are. I believe the best moments aren’t staged. They unfold naturally, in the quiet glances, the belly laughs, and those unspoken connections shared with your loved ones. My goal is to capture those raw, in-between moments that truly make your wedding day yours!

Think of me as your photo fairy godsister - specializing in transforming even the most "meh" moment into a work of photographic art that is both artistic and organic. Not to brag, but I’ve made a crowded getting-ready shot at a Holiday Inn with 2 feet of space between the bed and the window look like a Caravaggio-esque portrait

  * ### Katherine is an ABSOLUTE DREAM to work with

•Verified review

•Matt & S.•Dec 18, 2025

This review is long overdue. Working with Katherine was, without question, one of the best decisions we made for our City Hall wedding in May 2025. Months of Instagram research led me to Katherine. I started following her work before I was even engaged. She is phenomenal at what she does. From our very first interaction, her communication was exceptional. Katherine is prompt, thoughtful, and genuinely attentive. She took the time to truly understand our vision, ensuring every image beautifully reflected the aesthetic and overall tone we hoped for. Beyond her remarkable talent behind the camera, Katherine was an invaluable presence throughout the planning process. She went above and beyond to help us develop a clear, well-organized schedule, which made our wedding day feel effortless and seamless, which she absolutely did not need to do (I still appreciate you so much for this Katherine). Her calm, confident guidance kept everything on track and allowed us to fully relax and enjoy the moment, knowing we were in capable hands. What truly sets Katherine apart is her warmth and presence. She has an incredible ability to make people feel comfortable and at ease, and our friends and family immediately felt that. My mother-in-law continues to remark on how much she loves Katherine and how wonderful she was at our wedding. Katherine blended naturally into the celebration while still providing gentle direction, managing group photos with efficiency and grace so that everyone felt seen and comfortable. When we received our gallery, we were absolutely blown away. Katherine has a rare eye for capturing intimate, emotional moments, many of which we didn’t even realize were unfolding at the time. There is a specific image she captured of my husband laughing while his grandfather is speaking during our ceremony; we could not figure out when it happened. It was not until we watched the video of our ceremony did we see it happen. It was a split second reaction and Katherine captured it beautifully. We asked that our wedding photos feel like an inside-joke but anyone looking in still feels like they are in on the joke and that is what she delivered. The photos are not just beautiful images; they are meaningful, timeless memories captured with care, intention, and artistry. There is just something so special about Katherine's work; she perfectly encapsulates every emotion in a photo. Seven months later, I'm still in awe. We are deeply grateful to Katherine for capturing our wedding so perfectly. If you are looking for a photographer who is highly organized, incredibly talented, and a true joy to work with, we cannot recommend her highly enough. Thank you a thousand times again Katherine! All our gratitude, M & S

  * ### Captured Our Day Beautifully

•Verified review

•Elaine•Nov 24, 2025

went from tears to laughing out loud while looking through everything. She captured so many small details we didn’t even notice in the moment, and now we get to keep those memories forever. Our wedding took place on a 100 acre property in the Catskills with a lot happening at once. Katherine and her team somehow managed to be everywhere, capturing our guests, our families, the groomsmen, and all the moments my husband and I missed while we were running around. We’ve looked through the gallery more times than I can count because the emotions in the photos feel exactly like the weekend. Her eye for lighting is incredible. Our friends noticed it right away and kept talking about it. She also made us feel so comfortable in front of the camera. We are two pretty goofy humans who don’t know how to pose, and she made us look like rockstars. Some of our favorite photos only happened because she grabbed us off the dance floor at the perfect time. Katherine was also so kind and flexible when we had to reschedule our wedding twice because of COVID. She helped keep us calm through all of that and reminded us that the day would still be special. We really can’t say enough good things about Katherine. Book her. You will not regret it.

  * ### Katherine was the best!

•Verified review•Incentivized review

•Jessica•Sep 14, 2025

Katherine was the perfect choice for our wedding photographer! From the start, Katherine was fun, reliable, and extremely detailed in her communication. On the day of our wedding, she did an amazing job of capturing all the emotions and special moments - her creative ideas and direction really helped keep us relaxed and made the whole experience so enjoyable. Katherine was superb at gently guiding us through the photography schedule, ensuring we stayed on track without feeling rushed. We've only received our sneak peak so far but are already thrilled with the beautiful photos and can't wait for the full gallery. Katherine's style is so aesthetic and cool and made us look like we walked out of a magazine. Highly recommend!!

  * ### The Best Photographer

•Verified review

•Ryan D.•Jul 8, 2025

Could not recommend Katherine more! My husband and I hired her to shoot our rehearsal dinner and wedding in NYC in March 2025 and she absolutely exceeded our expectations. Wedding party, family, and guests have constantly reached out to let us know how great the photos were and how nice Katherine was to work with. She wrangled a ton of extended family for photos, braved the cold to shoot on the street outside during the reception, and made the entire wedding photography process stress free. From the first call to the delivery of our final digital and film photos, she was amazing. Working with her was one of the best decisions we made for our entire wedding.

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### Not to be a downer, but… what if something happens to you before the wedding? How will we be covered for photography?

This situation has never occurred in 500+ weddings, BUT, on the off chance it does - I have a firm plan in place for any emergencies (car crash survivor here!). If something happens to me before the wedding, a trained associate from the team will step in. If something happens to me after the wedding but before receiving the gallery, trusted partners will access my Photo Will and follow the editing instructions to ensure you receive all of your wedding photos.

### We’re painfully awkward in front of the camera, and you said you’ll help us feel more comfortable, but… HOW? Will you be able to help us loosen up?

Oooo this is such a good question! I totally understand how it feels to be awkward in photos (I literally turn into Gollum in front of the camera). After working with nearly 1000 couples, I’ve only had about 7 be naturals in front of the camera (and they were the influencers and models). My secret sauce to having you feel comfortable in front of the camera is mix of my demeanor (hype woman mixed with therapist mixed with big sister energy) and direction (games, questions, other things to help take your mind off the camera).

### How do you differentiate between color and B&W photos? How do you decide which photo gets which edit?

You can expect about 80% of the photos in your wedding gallery to be in color and the remaining 20% in B&W. I choose which photos get what edit based primarily on location, scene, and lighting. I provide options for big moments like your ceremony exit and first dance in both color and B&W. For moments and photos where I want to remove the distraction of color to focus on the subject, I choose those in B&W.

### What is your backup system for the photos?

Oh, I care so passionately about backup systems! After your wedding, all of the photos will go through my ultra-secure triple backup system to prevent against any file loss. Multiple memory cards, physical hard drives, and digitally on the cloud. Your raw photos are saved for 6 months and you have access to the gallery for 18 months.

### How would you describe your editing style?

Timeless with an edge. True-to-life color. Lighting reminiscent of a Renaissance painting. A natural glowing touch to your skin. Blue skies and bright greens, without being overpowering. No #sepiabride here. Attention to detail only garnered from editing hundreds of thousands of images over my career.

### How many photos will we receive? Is there a limit?

I deliver approximately 100-150 photos per hour of coverage. There is no limit on the number of photos you will receive. My team and I photograph anywhere from 7-15k raw files for any wedding client. All the photos go through an intentional culling and editing process to ensure the final gallery unfolds as naturally as your wedding day.
