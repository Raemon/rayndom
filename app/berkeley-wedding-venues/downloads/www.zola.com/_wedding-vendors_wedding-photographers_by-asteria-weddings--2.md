I’m a SF Bay Area photographer with almost seven years of experience capturing life’s quiet, beautiful moments, from the anticipation of maternity to the tenderness of newborn days and the joy of growing families. In the past year, I found myself drawn to something new: weddings. I began second shooting and quickly realized how much I loved being part of a couple’s most meaningful day. But it was the micro weddings and elopements that truly spoke to me .Intimate, intentional celebrations where every detail feels personal and every moment holds weight.

What makes me different is the way I approach storytelling. With nearly seven years of experience capturing the quiet beauty of maternity, newborn, and family moments, I’ve learned to see emotion in the in-between details. When I began photographing weddings, especially intimate celebrations and elopements, I brought that same sensitivity with me. My focus isn’t on staging or posing but on preserving the real atmosphere and emotion of the day, creating images that feel timeless, artful, and deeply personal, the kind you can feel years later.

From the moment we first connected with By ASTERIA Weddings, their efficient, friendly, and detail-oriented communication style put us at ease. Their professional and organized presence on the day of our wedding allowed us to relax and truly enjoy each moment, confident that every special detail was being beautifully documented. The quality of their work was exceptional - the photos are aesthetic, elegant, and creatively captured, perfectly reflecting the joy and emotion of our day. The gallery was delivered promptly and organized perfectly, making it easy for us to relive every part of our wedding through their high-quality, timeless photos. We are thrilled with the work of By ASTERIA Weddings and would highly recommend them to any couple looking for a talented and dedicated photography team to capture their big day.

  * ### Loved our photos!!

•Verified review

•Martha•Oct 8, 2025

By ASTERIA Weddings was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding photography. They were very responsive and knowledgeable throughout the entire process, which put us at ease. Emmy, our photographer, is incredibly detailed and knew exactly what to capture to make our pictures amazing. My photos turned out better than I could have imagined - she was wonderful to work with and I couldn't have asked for a better wedding photographer. I highly recommend By ASTERIA Weddings to any couple looking for exceptional service and stunning results.

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 7 years as a photographer, I’ve never had to cancel a booking and I take that commitment to you very seriously! In the incredibly rare event that something unexpected comes up and I’m truly unable to be there, I’ve got you covered. I’ll arrange for one of my trusted colleagues or my amazing assistant (who’s fully trained and contracted) to step in. I’m also part of several wonderful photography communities, and I’ll personally share a list of talented professionals to help you find someone who feels like the perfect fit. You won’t be left without beautiful memories I promise!

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time can vary a little depending on the season, but I always aim to have your full wedding gallery ready within 30 days, often even sooner! I know how excited you’ll be to see your photos, so I work hard to deliver them promptly while still giving each image the love and care it deserves

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about a year before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you also offer video services?

Yes I offer a new digital version of a SUPER 8 camera!
