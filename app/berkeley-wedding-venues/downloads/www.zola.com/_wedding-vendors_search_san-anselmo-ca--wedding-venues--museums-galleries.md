![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We are so happy we went with Chabot Space and Science Center for our wedding. We wanted something unique that also aligned with our interests -- our background in physics, astronomy, and space. The staff at Chabot are incredibly kind and were quick to respond to our emails and questions. The space was incredibly expansive and unique for our guests. The planetarium ceremony was our favorite part, and we will treasure those memories forever. As an educator myself, I fully appreciate that Chabot is a non-profit organization and that my deposit/rental fee goes back to the community and staff.

“We loved this venue and all our memories from our wedding. We worked with Narod who helped in all communication. We also got help from Ryan in AV. They were both so easy going and great to work with! We loved how beautiful the setup is. The ceremony outside was so nice. The Redwood Hall is also so gorgeous for photos and fun for dancing. We also really liked the cocktail area. We got an animal ambassador and guests had fun seeing the ferret and kestrel. We got nothing but compliments related to how fun the venue was. We are so happy we chose this place for our wedding. We loved the experience. Thank you to CuriOdyssey for going above and beyond. From communication early on to day of.

“We're so glad we found the Los Altos History Museum for our wedding! The venue was perfect for an outdoor reception with 170 guests. The space is well enclosed with lots of beautiful greenery. The orchard in the back was a perfect spot for portraits during golden hour. The museum wedding coordinator Lisa was responsive, accommodating, knowledgeable, and had lots of great suggestions to make the day flow smoothly. They also let us store supplies at the venue the week leading up to the wedding which was very helpful. The bathrooms are the weakest part of this venue. They're clean but not the nicest and a little hard to find for guests. On the whole a great venue and made for a really special day. Would recommend!”Elijah K., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/eeb8aefe-cb8f-4a2b-8d96-31a1422a4893?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/los-altos-history-museum)

## About wedding venues in San Anselmo, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.

### Where Can You Find Exceptional Culinary Experiences in California?
