“We had our wedding at Boundary Oak in May 2024, and I can’t say enough great things about our experience—especially working with Angelique. From our very first tour her professionalism, warmth, and attention to detail were top tier. We toured seven venues before choosing Boundary Oak, and it was the combination of stunning grounds and exceptional customer service that sealed the deal for us. Our initial food tasting was decent—typical wedding food—but a new head chef joined about six months before our wedding. The improvement was noticeable and really elevated our reception meal. Our guests raved about the food! If I had to give any constructive feedback, it would be regarding the bridal suite. While functional, it could definitely benefit from an upgrade. Adding a private bathroom and a lock on the door would make a huge difference in comfort and privacy for the bride on such an important day. Overall, we had a fantastic experience at Boundary Oak and are so grateful to Angelique and the entire team for helping make our day so special!”Kamika W., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/526916a5-33b6-4a5d-b664-51c4f00afa12?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-clubhouse-at-boundary-oak)

“Hiddenbrooke Hills was a gorgeous venue and the team at Wedgewood Weddings made our day absolutely memorable! I really wanted something that felt like a garden wedding and this place definitely delivered. We had a gorgeous garden ceremony but we were through the moon about the pavilion, it looked so elegant! The entire day was so fun and easy with the help of my Wedgewood Weddings coordinator and banquet captain who made sure my husband and I were taken care of the entire day. If there were issues, I wasn't aware because they were so on top of taking care of everything. Thank you so much Wedgewood Weddings for making our wedding day amazing!”Maria & J., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/hiddenbrooke-hills-by-wedgewood-weddings)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Fairview Napa was a wonderful choice for our wedding venue. From the start, their communication was quick, responsive, and concise, making the planning process smooth and stress-free. The venue itself was beautiful, and we loved being able to have our ceremony and reception outdoors - it really fit our vision perfectly. The staff was amazing and helped execute our event flawlessly. The only downside was that while Fairview Napa is an all-inclusive venue, the included vendors for things like the florals and cake were not up to the quality we were hoping for, so we had to upgrade those services, which is extra money. I highly recommend their DJ and Officiant services, they helped contribute to making the day extra special. After upgrading services, we were also very pleased with the florist and the aesthetics of the cake! Overall though, the value was great and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend Fairview Napa to any couple looking for a stunning Napa wedding location. Special shout out to Valerie, our wedding coordinator, who worked with us the entire planning process. She is great at her job and her years of experience shine through!”Chelsea G., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/0e895501-c9cc-491b-a997-08d42a9f9078?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fairview-napa)

For starters Angela Muse helped us from start to finish on planning our day and every little detail in between! She was amazing to work with, she was clear, communicative, friendly and organized which is everything you want when you are planning your wedding! When I arrived at my reception I was blown away by the decor and how beautiful every detail was! Thank you so much Angela for all of your hard work and support in making my dream reception!!! The vendors that are connected to Fairview that I opted into having was DJ Keel and Ting at Montclair Florist. DJ Keel was a phenomenal MC and met with us ahead of time to get an idea of how we wanted our wedding MC'd as well as what we wanted our music to be like and let me tell you he achieved it!!! My guests were laughing, entertained and raving about the music all night! Thank you Dj Keel! I coordinated with Ting from Montclair Florist and although we did not talk much I have to say my bouquet and center pieces were the most beautiful flower arrangements I have ever seen! The flowers were stunning and she ran with the ideas I had and made it the most beautiful arrangement ever!! My guests were raving about the food and we were so supported by KeeKee our Banquet Manager! She checked in on us and made sure we were good throughout our reception! Book with Fairview you will not regret it the venue is beautiful and open, the tented pavilion is gorgeous, the food is delicious and the staff are phenomenal!!! Thank you Fairview for making the reception of my dreams!!!!”Tara W., 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/976fb9bd-0df6-4777-8d32-8494e7e817b2?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fairview-metropolitan)

## About wedding venues in Martinez, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530
  * 300 guests: $104,224



### Which California Venues Are Fully Accessible?

The Griffith House features wheelchair-accessible pathways throughout its Spanish-style grounds including the private ceremony lawn and separate preparation spaces for couples. You might also consider Holman Ranch Sunstone Winery and Villa del Sol d'Oro though you'll want to directly confirm their specific accessibility features when you visit. Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.

### Where Can You Find Exceptional Culinary Experiences in California?

La Valencia Hotel in La Jolla delivers impeccable service with menu options from lobster bisque to perfectly prepared steak. You'll love Vibiana in Los Angeles with its chef-driven menus served in a stunning restored cathedral setting.
