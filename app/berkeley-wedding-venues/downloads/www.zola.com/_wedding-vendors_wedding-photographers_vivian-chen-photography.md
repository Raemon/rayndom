We are visual storytellers with nearly two decades of experience who focus on organic moments while highlighting a sense of space and showcasing your beloved communities authentically. For the introverted camera shy, your comfort is our priority before we even start shooting. We photograph discreetly with an emphasis on candids so from the moment you first see each other to that last sweaty song on the dancefloor, you’ll be relaxed and focused on one another and won’t even notice we’re there.

We always anticipate when to step in and when to hang back and let the instance unfold naturally; help figure out a stress-free timeline to keep the day flowing including formal group portraits that are often hard to wrangle on the spot; love using natural light and wide open spaces to compose captivating scenes and listen with intention and offer supportive suggestions. Most importantly, we’ll remind you to slow down, breathe and take it all in. NOTE: Due to the increased amount of fake and scam inquiries, I DO NOT respond to inquiries via Zola. Please contact me at my personal website: vivianchen[.com] I can't wait to learn more!

  * ### Absolutely love our photos! 

•Verified review

•Christina B.•Apr 24, 2025

I highly recommend working with Vivian Chen and her associate photographer Erin Prado for your wedding! Both of them were wonderful from start to finish and our photographs came out gorgeous. I really wanted a photographer with a natural look (not the overly bright/blown out look you so often get in wedding photos) and a focus on candids, and they came out just as fantastic as I expected from looking through their portfolios. We worked with Erin for a mini engagement session and our wedding and she was lovely on both days - really relaxed and personable while still giving us great direction on poses and positioning. Small things so we were still moving naturally and acting like ourselves, but really helpful (ie: having my husband put his hand in his pocket, reminding me to hold my bouquet lower). She also did lots of candid-style/natural positioning, like having us look at each, talk, laugh, walk, etc… and all of those are my favorite shots. She’s also just really nice, professional, and respectful - we did private vows and she gave us some space for privacy while still getting some lovely shots of it. The final edits done by Vivian came out beautifully, her style feels very cinematic and I love it! She also turned them around much faster than I expected, we got teasers 4 days after our wedding, and the full gallery of over 850 photos in just two weeks! She advised us to expect 4-6 weeks so that was a lovely surprise (probably helped by our wedding being a bit before busy season). I’d absolutely recommend them both to anyone!

  * ### Amazing photos 

•Verified review

•Alex P.•Sep 13, 2023

We cannot recommend Vivian highly enough for your wedding photography! We had multiple guests compliment her professionalism and stealthiness on the day of the wedding. Vivian’s calm demeanor was MUCH appreciated on the hectic wedding day. She is a superstar. She made sure we didn’t fall behind with our timeline even though we had requested a large number of portraits. Even though we’re a bit camera awkward Vivian was great at posing us and guests for shots. But where Vivian really shines is all of the candid shots that capture the pure joy and excitement of the day! She was so fast to provide us with our wedding photos, and we love looking back at them. The photos are framed well, have true to life coloring, and are just beautiful.

My musical group, Bay Area Strings, has performed at several weddings and receptions where Vivian was the photographer. Her event work is unobtrusive, taking great photographs without anyone noticing! We have ended up using several of her candid photographs of our string players, as she has a great eye for composition and color, with a modern and artistic style that still focuses on personality of the subjects. I have also noticed that her turnaround time to provide high-quality photos to the client and vendors is very fast compared to many others we have worked with.
