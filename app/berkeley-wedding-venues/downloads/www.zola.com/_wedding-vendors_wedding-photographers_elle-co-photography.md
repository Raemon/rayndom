I am a luxury destination photographer based in MICHIGAN, COLORADO & FLORIDA! I am ALL over Michigan and all over the nation! I have a home in Lansing, Holland & Traverse City. I travel all over Michigan capturing my clients from Lansing to Grand Rapids to the west coast of Lake Michigan to Mackinac Island & Traverse City to all metro Detroit! I have a second home in Vail/Summit County, CO as well as Clearwater Beach/Tampa. This allows me to be local to multiple places and states! This career is so much more than just showing up and taking photos. It's emotion, it's detail, it's getting to know my clients and capturing each of them uniquely.

As much as I wish I could be everyone's dream photographer that is not reality so I like to make sure we're a fit. Your photographer is going to be with you your entire day. Because of that I want to make sure you’re with the right one. You're not just 'another booking to me' & I strive to create genuine connections with each & every client. Not only do we provide professional timeline planning for your photo needs, my team & I are experienced in all different lighting scenarios and are ready for things that come up as we document your day! I want you to look back on your photos and remember those moments of time and how you felt during them.

  * ### High quality team and photos!

•Verified review

•London•Feb 22, 2025

Elle & Co Photography was a dream to work with from the beginning to past delivery of photos! The quality of work is truly remarkable and magazine worthy. Dani and Jed kept our wedding day on schedule with our timeline and ensured we got all the photos we wanted. We were left with timeless memories that we'll cherish forever thanks to their incredible talent and dedication. We highly recommend Elle & Co to any couple looking for a passionate, talented and professional photographer! Love, London & Damian

  * ### If you want the best, hire Elle & Co!

•Verified review

•Isabelle•Feb 20, 2025

Dani shot our engagement session in Indiana (where we live) and our elopement in Colorado. We vetted SO.MANY photographers and the long search ended up with Elle & Co Photography and we are elated with our choice! Dani's professionalism is top-notch and she's also so fun to be around. She has a talent with her profession but her passion puts her over the edge. Dani's knowledge for locations helped us nail down the perfect elopement spot. She also nailed down our vision for our engagement session location; she is well versed in locations all around and we were thankful for all the help in planning that. The day of our elopement had unpredictable weather and I didn't want to get wet and be rained on. Dani was able to execute a plan for us to elope later in the day without any stress or hassle. She had new timeline and plans over to us immediately so we could have the perfect outside elopement and the day turned out amazing! Jed (her PHENOMENAL second hand man) brought & put up a pop up changing tent for us so I didn't have to hike in my dress the whole time. Our elopement was everything we wanted and more thanks to Dani & Jed & Elle & Co Photographer. Thank you forever!

  * ### Elopement & Boudoir photos, amazing experience!

•Verified review

•The S.•Feb 10, 2025

From first contact to wedding day, I am so happy to have chosen Elle and Co. and specifically Dani. I couldn't be happier with communication, energy, and direction while taking photos. Our Colorado elopement was beautiful and Dani helped with every step including finding a wonderful spot. She kept us updated on weather and timeline so we had nothing to worry about and even hyped us up beforehand. During my boudoir shoot she made extra effort to make me comfortable since I've never done anything like that before. The pictures were so good and made the perfect wedding day gift for my new hubby. Highly recommend Elle and Co. to anyone who has photography needs but especially if you think you might want to elope to a gorgeous spot and do a private event or if you want to take some boudoir type photos for a special gift. She goes above and beyond with everything she does and you can't do better. Thanks Dani!!

  * ### Hire Elle & Co!

•Verified review

•Kayla•Feb 10, 2025

Not only is Dani @ Elle & Co an extremely talented and professional photographer, but she was so comforting to have next to me throughout my wedding day. She is comforting, flexible, organized and laid back all in one. Dani executed our vision flawlessly and made suggestions where to do portraits and she chose perfect spots. Cannot recommend her enough, hire Elle & Co!

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### Where exactly are you located?

We are located in *3* states; Colorado, Michigan & Florida! We live between the 3 states throughout the year so we're able to locally accommodate your engagement session, boudoir, elopement & wedding needs with hands on support. Even if your wedding or session is out of state, I travel nationwide with all my gear and expertise making destination photography seamless & stress-free.

### Can you help with elopement or session locations?

Absolutely! I specialize in insider knowledge uncovering hidden local gems and off-the-beaten-path spots that most people wouldn't find on their own, especially in Colorado, Michigan & Florida where I am local. I get to know exactly what kind of spot you're looking for through a detailed questionnaire, then make location and timing suggestions to ensure stunning photos & a smooth experience. Even if your wedding is outside of my local states, I am available nationwide and can scout amazing locations anywhere with the same attention to detail and insider knowledge.

### What happens if it rains on our elopement day?

My goal is to make your day stress-free and ensure your gallery tells the full story no matter the weather. All elopement packages come with FREE time insurance. This means we can change the time during the day based on the weather. I will keep an eye on the weather forecast and communicate plans with you to find out if we want to embrace possible rain/weather or if we want to pick a new time or location.

### What do you specialize in?

We specialize in capturing authentic, timeless moments across elopements, full day weddings, engagements & family sessions. Our focus is on storytelling through images- whether it's an intimate elopement on a beach or mountaintop just the 2 of you, a full wedding celebration with 200 guests and a full day of photo ops or candid family moments at home or outdoors. We blend natural, candid photography with intentional posing & expert lighting to ensure every session feels relaxed, fun & uniquely tailored to you.

### How do you help couples feel comfortable in front of the camera?

I direct you with prompts to evoke natural movement & natural reactions while coming in and guiding you into natural poses. My approach is fun, laid back and guided so your photos feel effortless.

### Where have you travelled?

As I mentioned, I am local to Colorado, Michigan & Florida but I have also been all across the US and the Bahamas. International events & sessions often require passport & local government permits for me to work there and I take care of all that.
