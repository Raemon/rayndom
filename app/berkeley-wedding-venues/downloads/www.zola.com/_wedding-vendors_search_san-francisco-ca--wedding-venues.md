Desde el primer día que fuimos a conocer las instalaciones, el señor Gary fue muy atento y respetuoso, contestó a todas nuestras dudas. Tal vez nuestro evento fue algo fuera de lo común, a diferencia de los eventos de boda que se organizan aquí, nosotros contratamos el granero para el 25 de Diciembre para celebrar los 15 años de mi hija , sabemos que son días festivos donde la gente está con su familia , más sin embargo recibimos todo su apoyo para que el evento se hiciera realidad en este día tan especial , puedo decirles que fue una experiencia maravillosa, fue en evento de ensueño y de igual manera nos hospedamos en la casa, donde realmente nos sentimos como en nuestro hogar , sinceramente todas las instalaciones estuvieron limpias en todo momento, Gary estuvo al pendiente de si necesitábamos algo y al igual si la empresa que contratamos para la planeación necesitaban apoyo. Quiero animar a todos los papás que deseen hacerle su quinceañera a su hija, que consideren contratar los servicios de Suisun Valley Inn, ya que harán que su hija viva una experiencia única y de ensueño, no se arrepentirán. Sr Gary agradezco todas sus atenciones y muy pronto estaremos trabajando con usted para los 15 años de mi otra hija… Bendiciones”Fabiola M., 22 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/0dbc73ce-706c-4f4e-8b41-7324823426c8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

We moved out of the country shortly after getting engaged and I’m so glad we found Wedgewood weddings! Planning was super easy and they made sure every aspect was easy to plan but could also be made exactly how we wanted it. Their venue is GORGEOUS- you cannot beat the bridge view in the background of our ceremony! And their food was DELICIOUS, even buffet skeptics LOVED the food. And their florist, cake, and DJ vendors were fabulous. The log cabin was well worth the money spent- they made our big day even better than we could have hoped and they also made it so easy for us.”Jill M G., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/70082ec6-d100-4ace-8e6b-f1d81da0b0c5?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/presidio-log-cabin-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“We loved the idea of booking a reception venue that already had an incredible staff in-house. GAMH provided us with great care and kind but honest input every step of the way. The event coordinator (the fabulous Mandy!), audio, lighting, catering, servers, bar service, coat check…..was perfection because the team is their own and prideful for the space and its legendary music history. It was special to introduce so many out-of-town guests to this beautiful classic of a venue in the heart of our city and dance the night away. We’ll never forget it and will enjoy attending shows that much more forever.”Emily R., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/great-american-music-hall)

In the middle of the party, my couple tied the knot shocking all of their guests. Everything could not have been more perfect. The team at Marigold was super communicative, polite, and helpful. The location is perfect for a San Francisco cocktail reception. The pricing was fantastic and the ambiance is really what impressed my couple. Highly recommend this event space!”Taylor Rae, 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/marigold-event-space)

“Sam's Grill may be the fifth-oldest restaurant in the country, but it trades not on that, but on its food, its fun and its friendliness. Its seafood is the best on the West Coast, which means you won't get sand dabs or rex sole if they weren't caught the night before. (You will at other restaurants, which means they aren't fresh, despite the waiter's oleaginous assurances.) The steaks-- especially for a fish house-- are praised by steak lovers (I'm partial to seafood), and the burgers and breakfasts served in Sam's Tavern are the best in town. And since town is San Francisco, that's saying something.”John B., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/sams-grill-and-seafood-restaurant)

“The Omni made an incredible first impression on us. It’s a beautiful & grand space, but there was something very comfortable about it at the same time. That’s mainly due to Jano Paredes, our event coordinator. He was so welcoming & genuinely passionate about creating a special event for us. We toured two other venues, Julia Morgan & Webster Hall. While these two venues are beautiful, there weren’t nearly as caring or appreciative of our business as the Omni. The Omni made the stressful planning process enjoyable (we planned it in about 3 months!) & they were understanding when we had last minute changes & requests. They were also very flexible throughout the wedding planning. They even swapped out some of the beer in their package so they could bring in brands we liked better. Amanda Maggard is amazing. She managed the accommodations for all the guests. Many of our guests also commented on how incredible the check-in was. It was rainy that weekend, so the Omni was quick to offer complimentary umbrellas. They even gave each guest a free drink voucher at the hotel bar! Amanda also made sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable in the Presidential Suite, complete with champagne, ice buckets, & several glasses for my visitors. It’s a lovely space to take getting-ready pictures. I was originally worried the grand ballroom wasn’t going to fit our vision & was torn on using the same space for the ceremony & reception (they have another room available if you’d prefer not to do this), but it was gorgeous! The spaces felt totally unique between the ceremony & the reception. The grand ballroom really provides a blank slate to create something beautiful & it can be difficult to appreciate when it’s completely empty. The mezzanine where the cocktail hour was held is beautiful & needs no additional decorations & the dim sum buffet was a huge hit. Guests loved the reception dinner menu. We went with a plated dinner selection of sea bass, chicken, or oyster mushrooms. The crab soup was delicious & by far the most popular. The passion fruit cheesecake was exceptional, but we also offered our guests a lovely Marjolaine cake slice. Later that evening, the Presidential suite where I initially got ready was transformed into our honeymoon suite. We were greeted with chocolate covered strawberries, champagne, & two custom Omni robes with our initials embroidered on them (my new initials since I was changing my name). It was so touching that it brought tears to our eyes. The Financial District was the optimal neighborhood to host our wedding. It was very safe & picturesque. We had a several family members nervous about coming to San Francisco because of the negative media coverage, but they all fell in love with the city by the end of the weekend. I know Webster Hall wouldn’t have given us the same treatment (they didn’t seem to care if they had our business or not). Julia Morgan was wonderful, but with the Omni, we just had a feeling we’d be in the best possible hands by people who genuinely cared, & we were right. Now, we love the Omni so much that we had Valentine’s Day at Monte’s two weeks after our wedding & the hotel surprised us with dessert & champagne, as well as a card signed by their staff congratulating us on our wedding. It’s a bar we now frequent because of the quality of service, food/drinks, & of course, our wonderful memories there. The Omni was the absolute best decision of our entire wedding.”Seana P., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/omni-hotel-san-francisco)

“The Pearl will forever hold a special place in the hearts of myself and my husband. It was the first venue we toured and we knew right away it was going to make for such a special wedding day. We are now 2 days post wedding and we couldn't be happier with our decision. The entire planning process was a breeze thanks to Carrie. All of our guests raved abut how amazing it was that the ceremony and reception were at the same location! We did our ceremony on the roof, as well as our cocktail hour on the roof. Then we had guests walk downstairs to our reception area. The bartenders were incredible and did a fantastic job keeping our 130 guests well fueled. We hired Melons Catering, a caterer on The Pearl's short list of caterers, who absolutely knocked it out of the park when it came to the food. Guests couldn't stop talking about the quality and service of dinner! We are over the moon with how our wedding went and have zero bad things to say about The Pearl, or anyone who works there. If you're looking for a venue that screams urban city, but green and organic as well... look no further, as The Pearl can do it all. 10/10 recommend!!”Jacey P., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-pearl)

“From the moment I sent an initial request to Diane, the event manager, working with BStar was an absolute Joy. I was able to work with Diane to meet the needs of our group including several dietary restrictions. She had no problem going back and forth and adjusting the menu. When we got to the restaurant we were in the most adorable private room. It was inside, but felt like it was outside with the decor. Each place was set with a personalized menu (we did not ask for this, they just did it on their own). The manager, Matt was amazing. He set us up, made recommendations on drinks and then talked us through the appetizers we had ordered. We had the Appetizer combo platter (Platha dipper, veggie samosas, spring rolls. and firecracker cauliflower ) and Sticky Finger Riblettes and green tea salad. We then ordered off the menu. Each food was better than the next. The manager and our server were so attentive to us. When we got the bill it was perfect. No errors at all. I would literally eat here every day, as well as have a private event here every time I could. Too bad I live on the east coast.”Stacey, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/b-star)

“My husband and I hosted a rehearsal dinner at Boudin Bistro on Halloween (the day before our wedding). Mishan and her team were so helpful and they made the planning process was really easy. Our friends and family loved the food and the bread favors. Boudin left the bakery catwalk open for us, which everyone enjoyed. Boudin also made custom Halloween shapes for us per my request (bats). The decor and signature cocktails were perfect. We are so happy we decided to host our Halloween rehearsal dinner at Boudin.

“We hosted our wedding at the Presidio Officers' Club and had truly the most special, incredible day of our lives. It was clean, well-organized, with delicious food and friendly staff. Not to mention, the planning team at the Presidio, through Wedgewood Weddings, was truly best-in-class. Wedgewood prepared us so well, providing a planning binder and step-by-step instructions. They checked in with us multiple times, providing walk-throughs, and answering every question extremely promptly. We especially loved our planner and day-of coordinator, Christian, who went out of his way to make everything so seamless. Christian taught us how to do our ceremony, including little details such as hand placement, went out of his way to accommodate a creative painting engagement, and provided private time for us newlyweds. He was perfect! So grateful to this beautiful venue and our wonderful team. We will treasure our experience with Wedgewood forever.”Natasha H., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4ee55ad9-e863-4cba-a1fb-b459a421b4da?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/officers-club-at-the-presidio)

Smart venues like Fort Mason Center give you the best of both worlds with climate-controlled indoor spaces and floor-to-ceiling windows keeping those gorgeous views.
