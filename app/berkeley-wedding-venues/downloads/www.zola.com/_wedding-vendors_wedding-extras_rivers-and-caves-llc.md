  * ### Absolutely Outstanding

•Verified review

•Carly Ella O.•Jun 22, 2025

George and his wife were absolutely brilliant to work with – they created some fantastic and innovative ideas to make my clients (Veronika Dash’s) wedding so magical. They made custom stirrers to reflect the beautiful castle environment and delivered it exactly as promised. They were so great at communication and I highly recommend them 10 out of 10!

  * ### Perfect for our wedding Mai Tai bar!

•Verified review

•Patricia•Jun 21, 2025

Rather than a champagne toast, we decided to treat our guests to a make your own Mai Tai bar for toasts! When we found these personalized stir sticks to write our names on- we couldn’t pass it up to make the Mai Tai bar special. The stir sticks are fun colors and we were excited at how wonderful they turned out when we unboxed them!!!!

  * ### Name tag

•Verified review

•Letty H.•Jun 22, 2025

Absolutely thrilled with the wine name tags! The team was so helpful and truly went above and beyond. While traveling, I realized I’d forgotten to order two tags. Other vendors wouldn’t assist due to the small order, but George quickly responded and made sure I had them in time for my daughter’s big event. His customer service is second to none—willing to help regardless of how small the order was, which was truly amazing. Exceptional service—I’m so thankful and forever grateful.

  * ### Perfect drink stirrers 

•Verified review

•Bryce B.•Jun 21, 2025

Rivers and Caves LLC was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. Their communication was super quick and professional throughout the entire planning process. The quality of their work and design was top-notch - the rehearsal dinner and cocktail party decor they provided really helped those events stand out and feel special. We were thrilled with how everything turned out and would highly recommend Rivers and Caves to any couple looking for high-quality, well-designed wedding event extras.

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### What makes Rivers & Caves different from other wedding detail vendors?

We’re not a specialty items reseller. We’re a custom design studio with decades of professional branding and creative experience. That means you’re not just getting a product, you’re getting thoughtful design, high-quality craftsmanship, and one-on-one collaboration to ensure every detail fits your day perfectly.

### Do you offer fully custom designs, or just personalized templates?

We specialize in fully custom designs, nothing off-the-shelf. Every stirrer, drink tag, and place card is crafted from scratch with your wedding’s style, theme, or story in mind. Whether you have a clear vision or need help figuring it out, we’ll work with you to create something that’s truly yours.

### Whom will I work with regarding my wedding needs?

When you reach out, you’ll be speaking directly with George or Laura, the duo who designs and makes everything in-house. No middlemen, no long email chains. Just real, responsive communication with the people actually creating your wedding items.

### How do you keep clients updated throughout the process?

We strive to keep things stress-free and transparent. You’ll receive updates at every step of the process, including proofs and photos of your pieces as they’re being made so you’re always in the loop and confident your order is on track.

### How fast is your turnaround time?

Because we design and produce everything ourselves (right here in our studio), we’re able to move quickly and efficiently. While timelines depend on your order size and level of customization, we always work with your wedding schedule in mind and we communicate clearly to make sure you know what to expect and everything arrives on time.

### Where do you ship?

We currently ship within the U.S. and Canada. This helps us ensure reliable delivery and peace of mind, especially with important event deadlines. If your wedding is taking place internationally, we recommend shipping to someone in the U.S. who can bring the items to the venue. This avoids the risk of delays or customs issues that can happen with international shipments. We're happy to help coordinate timing to make sure everything arrives when and where you need it.
