The Orange Dragonfly Weddings and Events 5.0

  * Offers 6 services
  * Starts at $1,500 
  * Serves Sacramento, CA

Orange Dragonfly Weddings & Events is a mother-daughter team passionate about creating beautifully curated celebrations that reflect each couple’s unique story. We blend creativity, organization, and heart into every detail — from the first planning meeting to the last dance. With a balance of modern design and timeless style, we bring your vision to life in a way that feels effortless and authentically you. At Orange Dragonfly, we believe every wedding should feel personal, joyful, and unforgettable — and we’re here to make that happen.“Kristina and Susan were hands down the best decision that my husband and I made in our wedding process. I hit the ground running once we got engaged and was about 8 months into the journey when I started wondering what I was doing with myself and panicking about all of the details that I was still needing to figure out. After exploring various options in terms of wedding planning, I found The Orange Dragonfly and from there the rest was history! Right after I met with Kristina and Susan, we were automatically at ease. No matter what questions we had or details we needed help with, they were there and ready to guide us. They did not only make everything leading up to the big day feel far less daunting, but the day of the wedding went by seamlessly thanks to them and their abundance of care and attention to detail. There were of course small and unexpected changes that popped up on the wedding day, but we never felt a single worry or stress because of our confidence that they had it taken care of. On top of this, throughout the whole day and night, they went out of their way to make sure that Alex and I took breaks to soak everything in and even kept grabbing us drinks from the bar and ensuring that we had what we needed. I could honestly write an entire novel just singing their praises, but the bottomline is that you could never regret trusting your wedding with these lovely ladies! We are so blessed and thankful for all of their help and support. Thank you, Kristina and Susan!”Hannah K., a month ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/the-orange-dragonfly-weddings-and-events)

MBK Events 5.0 Sacramento, CA

  * Offers 3 services
  * Starts at $3,500 

Hi, I’m Morgan! Thank you so much for being here. I am the Owner and Lead Planner of MBK Events. Let’s get straight to it - I freaking love love and I love planning. I swear, celebrating love, planning events, and getting to meet new people is my specialty. While planning my own wedding, I realized that so many Brides are not enjoying the process - so, that's where I plan to step in! I officially launched my business in October of 2021 so I can help other brides execute, plan, style and enjoy the wedding planning process. It is the most magical time of your life so lets make sure it feels magical all the way to the big day!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Where do I even start? As soon as I got off my first inquiry call with Morgan, I immediately booked her and it was the best decision I made during the entire wedding planning process. We had less than a year to plan because of the specific date we wanted, and Morgan absolutely delivered (and more). We hired her as a full-time planner, and I cannot recommend this enough. Wedding stress? Don't know her. Morgan handled everything, from contacting all of our vendors and reviewing contracts, to securing us extra perks thanks to her amazing connections. She’s not only incredibly organized and professional, but also so much fun to work with. She knows how to get things done promptly and keeps the whole process stress-free. Honestly, we would have been lost without her. And let me just say, your wedding day WILL go smoothly with Morgan by your side. I cannot say enough positive things about MBK Events and how amazing this company truly is. My wedding day was magical and it was all thanks to Morgan.”Erica S., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/60931064-a14f-4e1d-9907-0047ba5c6242?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/mbk-events)

Hello 💫 I wanted to a minute to introduce myself, My name is Lisa, I’m a wife & mama, and I’ve finally decided to take a passion of mine & turn it into a career.

As a mostly DIY bride it was SO convenient to be able to explain my vision, hand off my binder, and take comfort that Lisa had everything under control from there!

I've loved weddings since childhood, from sketching dresses in my notebooks to planning my own wedding in 2019. That experience confirmed my passion for coordination, logistics, and making wedding days seamless. After serving as Maid of Honor multiple times, I became the go-to planner for friends. Since then, I’ve coordinated 22+ weddings and events, specializing in DIY and backyard celebrations. I believe a beautiful wedding doesn’t need a huge budget, just thoughtful planning. Let’s create a stress-free, unforgettable day together!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Kalyna and Bella Dia Events was truly one of the best parts of planning our wedding. We started planning about 18 months out, and from day one, Kalyna made the entire process feel smooth, stress-free, and even fun. We hired her for full-service planning, and she went above and beyond in every way. Kalyna helped us design a beautiful invitation suite that perfectly captured the style of our wedding — every detail, from the font choices to the finishing touches, felt intentional and cohesive. She was incredibly hands-on with our florals and décor too, helping us create a timeless, elegant look that felt personal to us. She even helped oversee set-up on the big day, making sure every arrangement, table setting, and design element came together exactly as we envisioned. What stood out the most was Kalyna’s organization and attention to detail throughout the entire 18 months. She kept us on track with checklists, timelines, and vendor coordination, making the whole process feel completely manageable. She thought of things we wouldn’t have even known to plan for, and truly made sure no detail was ever overlooked. Thanks to Kalyna, we were able to fully enjoy our wedding day, knowing that everything behind the scenes was taken care of. Our guests are still raving about how beautiful and seamless everything was. We can't thank Kalyna and Bella Dia Events enough for making our wedding everything we dreamed it would be! — Jennifer & Art Montoya”Jennifer M., 10 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/e91edd41-e4fd-4baa-9a4f-8fa1ca3585ab?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/bella-dia-events)

Christa Nicole Events 5.0 Sacramento, CA

  * Offers 3 services
  * Starts at $3,500 

My passion for events started while planning my own wedding 12 years ago. Freshly engaged and full of excitement, I was captivated by every little detail. Soon after I had family and friends asking me for help with their events, and that is when I fell in love with planning & event design. I began working for an event planning company in 2018 and built my expert knowledge and vendor relationships through years of experience with the ups and downs of the wedding industry. In 2023, I decided it was time to start my own company and dove headfirst into perfecting my planning process and building Christa Nicole Events.“We couldn't have asked for a better wedding planner! Christa went above and beyond to ensure every detail of our wedding weekend was perfect. From the early stages of planning to the final send-off, she was organized, attentive, and always a step ahead. Her meticulous attention to detail ensured nothing was overlooked, and she truly brought our vision to life. She was professional and made the entire process stress-free for us.

  * Serves Sacramento, CA

Hi, I’m Devin — the heart behind Magnolia Moments. What began as a love for helping friends plan their special days has grown into a passion for creating joyful, stress-free celebrations. At Magnolia Moments, we believe love lives in the details, and every couple deserves a day that feels uniquely theirs. From timelines to tiny touches, we handle it all with heart, intention, and a little magic — so you can be fully present for every beautiful moment.“Being a very organized person myself, I initially went back and forth on whether or not to hire a wedding coordinator. I wasn’t sure if it was something I really needed or wanted to spend the extra money on. But as time went on, I realized how important it was to me that our wedding day flowed seamlessly and that I didn’t want to rely on myself, my vendors, or my family to figure out all the logistics in real time. That’s when I came across Devin Gamble, and from the very first day of our communication, I could feel her sense of organization, kindness, attention to detail, and genuine excitement. We hired Devin for day-of coordination, but she went above and beyond in every way leading up to the wedding. Every call, email, and meeting with her left us feeling more confident that our day was going to run smoothly. She even joined us for a full venue walk-through and pointed out so many small but important details that I would have completely overlooked on my own. On the wedding day itself, she was incredible, calm, attentive, and completely in control. Everything flowed perfectly, everyone enjoyed themselves, and no one needed to worry about a thing. If you’re contemplating whether to hire a day-of coordinator, I can promise you it’s one of the best investments you can make for your wedding. Having Devin on our team allowed us to be fully present and truly enjoy every single moment. To put it simply, Devin is an absolute gem. Her professionalism, warmth, and genuine care for her couples shine through in everything she does. We are endlessly grateful for all the time, energy, and heart she put into making our day as seamless and joyful as it was. We recommend her wholeheartedly to anyone getting married in Northern California. You will be so thankful to have her by your side.”Danielle B., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/f9456a1a-be7b-4ea2-9a7d-4f8f9a940b44?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/magnolia-moments-events)

I'm here to help you plan your wedding, with the knowledge and expertise to ensure you feel empowered to make the RIGHT decisions about your big day! I'll help guide you through the process so you understand how to focus your budget on the things that are important to YOU, and help you put together a cohesive design that reflects YOUR unique vibe! When it comes time for execution, let me worry about all the details so you can sit back and enjoy your wedding day!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Ali is literally the best wedding coordinator a couple could ask to have. From the moment we first spoke with her, she made us feel comfortable and confident that we would have a smooth wedding planning experience and stress free wedding day. Although the stress is inevitable, Ali lifted a ton of weight off of our shoulders the entire last month leading up to our wedding and the wedding day was more beautiful than we could’ve imagined. Our only regret was not choosing full service planning with Ali and only going with month-of! We can't imagine the process going smoothly without Ali and her team and highly recommend her to all of our friends and family. She helped us more than we could have ever hoped – from always being available to give us advice on any decisions we had to make, big or small, to making sure we truly were able to enjoy and not worry about anything but being present on our wedding day. There are so many behind-the-scene logistical challenges that we did not even notice until we thought about it after the wedding and realized were handled by her team. We were able to trust her 100% in any stylistic choices because we know she has a good eye for aesthetics and making our vision come to life. She took the time and effort to learn what we as a couple uniquely like, and made sure that everything was perfect on the wedding day. Ali’s experience and advice are what makes her planning invaluable, even the smallest things you might not think about can make such a big difference on how the day pans out. We genuinely don’t think our wedding would have been possible without her and her expert team!”Analisa S., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/5114555f-746d-4089-b340-583ccfb7aab7?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/ab-event-co)

Stephanie Marie Morris has spent 15+ years in the event industry: fueled by the social impact, togetherness, and love that each carefully-planned event has imparted onto its guests. With a sociological background + training in event design + planning, & her detail-oriented eye; Stephanie approaches each Wedding as an opportunity to connect to each client's innermost desires, while fostering memorable relationships. Just as each individual has a unique fingerprint, molded by inherent characteristics and shaped by experiences; Stephanie strives to identify that unique vision that each couple has, to then craft an event that resonates :)“To say working with Stephanie was amazing, would be an understatement. My husband and I got engaged in late December 2024 and we hired Stephanie January 2025 to plan our Lake Tahoe October 2025 wedding. From the moment we first made contact with Stephanie, she was completely committed to helping us create our special day. I had a very specific vision for how I wanted our wedding day to look and Stephanie delivered beyond what I could have imagined. Her attention to detail is uncanny. The minutia was just as important as the grand events of the day. I consider myself to be an organized person, but Stephanie's organization is next level. I was definitely a "type A" or "needy" bride and continually checked in with Stephanie about details/schedules/vendors/etc., and sometimes even jumped the gun on planning details. Not once did Stephanie make me feel bad about my nervous energy or impulsive decisions, but rather reassured me of the planning process and reminded me that whatever I wanted she was going to help me get it; whether it was a specific vendor or design detail. She was always available to answer my emails or texts all while meeting the needs of her other brides, and that is something I greatly appreciated. The weeks leading up to your wedding day become hectic and overwhelming at times, but that's where Stephanie shines. She took care of every detail imaginable-and I mean EVERY DETAIL. She help relieved the pressure off my husband and I, which allowed us to enjoy and revel in the excitement of the coming day. On our wedding day, she worked endlessly to make sure every aspect was perfect and exactly how we wanted it, all while still finding the time to physically check in with both myself and husband while we were getting ready for the day. Even throughout the afternoon and evening, if my husband or I needed something she would magically appear, despite continuing to juggle the events of the evening. Stephanie is the type of planner, and person, who gives 100% of herself to her couples and that is an aspect of a planner that money can't buy. She cares deeply about helping you achieve the wedding day of your dreams, and she certainly did just that, and more for us. Choosing Stephanie to plan our wedding day was the best decision we could have made and I will forever be thankful for her and the day she created for my husband and I. Thanks to Stephanie we truly had the best wedding day, and in turn, have the fondest memories to carry with us.”Hanna B., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/72d5c998-2d53-41fc-b957-3f918e5ab29c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/stephanie-marie-co)

Let's face it, every couple needs wedding planning help and traditional full-blown wedding planning is super expensive! At The Venlist, we're providing a modern way for busy couples to get wedding planning help at a price point that fits their budget from coast to coast.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Erin Avery (The VenList) was more than a dream - she is a dream maker, fantasy creator, and one of the most organized people we’ve ever worked with. There honestly aren't words that capture the depth of our appreciation for her work. She took us through the whole journey as our virtual planner, guided us through the panic moments, saw the potential in our vision, and as our Day-Of Coordinator ensured we have the most magical wedding we could have ever dreamed up. She respected our budget, never wanted us to compromise on our vision, found vendors who could bring that vision to life, and made us feel like family the entire experience. Erin brings a profound attention to detail, care for us as a couple, calming spirit, and gentle smile to every person she interacts with. She wants you to have your day go smoothly, as stress free as possible, and makes sure that everything is organized, found, and done correctly. We couldn't have asked for a better person to walk us forward into married life, keeping track of every nuance, contacting every vendor, and protecting our time as we approached the biggest and happiest day of our lives. Erin is truly the best and a master at her craft. If you’re considering working with her, that very first meeting you will feel the beautiful energy and excitement she shares for what matters most to you - and she’ll make sure that your day is one you’ll never forget.”Silas, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/the-venlist)
