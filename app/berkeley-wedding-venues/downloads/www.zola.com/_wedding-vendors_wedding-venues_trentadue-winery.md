  * ### Amazing Venue and Professional Staff

•Verified review

•Casey F.•Sep 28, 2024

Trentadue is an amazing venue. I had my wedding at Trentadue Winery. The venue is gorgeous and large! We had no trouble with 115 people but it can do a lot more. There's multiple different spaces that offered us a lot of flexibility (as well as a nice indoor area incase of rain or smoke during fire season). The coordinators and staff we worked with at Trentadue were very friendly and on top of it! They communicated quickly and were extremely helpful and attentive on the day of our rehearsal and wedding. You have to use their wine for your event but it tastes great and they provide a sizable discount. My partner and I loved our wedding and would definitely recommend Trentadue as a wedding venue.

  * ### Trentadue was wonderful!

•Verified review

•Carol•Nov 26, 2020

Our daughter’s dream come true wedding was at Trentadue in November 2019. We were already familiar with the wonderful wine and property, having visited many times over the years. Sarah was a delight to work with, communication was excellent throughout the planning stage. The weeks leading up to the wedding date were stressful because of smoke and fire. Our guests began arriving several days before the wedding to clear, autumn weather. The wedding day was gorgeous. Trentadue prepared the lawn seating, arch and pavilion as we requested. They worked well with our caterer and vendors but didn’t hover or micromanage. To sum up, if you want a gorgeous setting with excellent wine and a wonderful team to work with, choose Trentadue for your wedding.
