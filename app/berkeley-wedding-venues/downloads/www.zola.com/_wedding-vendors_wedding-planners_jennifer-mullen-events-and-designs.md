I am passionate about my career, organized, action-oriented, value-driven, and love a good love story. Each wedding day is another day I get to not only create a gorgeous wedding, but a day to truly express the story of the couple and who they are. I can be your friend if you need one, but I can also be a third party objective opinion if you are stuck. I want to create a personal and incredible wedding day alongside you by taking away any and all of that planning stress. I am excited to bring California flair to gorgeous Mississippi events and beyond. Contact me and tell me your story, because I want to be a part of celebrating it.

We pride ourselves in: Breaking out of the mold! Wanting to do something that doesn’t exist on Pinterest! Using other inspiration besides just other weddings: architecture, landscape, travel. Constructing your day the way YOU want to! Doing the unexpected and non-traditional! Creating a day you will never forget!
