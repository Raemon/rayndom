My name is Thomas Seabury I am a wedding photographer of 9 years, over the past 5 years shooting just over 100 weddings per year. Each wedding I take on the roll of coordinator, photographer, and personal assistant keeping the entire day running smoothly and keeping the stress of the day as far from the bride and groom as possible. I would love to be a huge part of your entire process from overall planning to execution of the day! In the off chance you're booking at a Northern CA Wedgewood venue, I have hundreds of hours of experience at each of their venues and work very closely with the everyone of the staff at Wedgewood.

I consider myself incredibly dedicated to ensure that I not only take the best possible photos of the day but to also make sure the day is enjoyed by the couple, as the photos can only be as good as the memories. On average I deliver 800+ photographs per 7 hour shoot and typically have a record breaking turn around of 3 - 9 days. With an optional night of sneak peak, or even a photo or two mid reception! A huge plus in my opinion is my absolute disgust towards A.I. Meaning that unlike some photographers I wont risk your gallery to save a few minutes on editing, I meticulously edit each photo by hand.

  * ### Our guests still talk about how amazing he was! 

•Verified review

•Nanna T.•Nov 8, 2025

Thomas is the most amazing photographer/artist/ just coolest human. From the start, their communication was efficient, friendly, and incredibly organized. He's not just a wedding photographer, he's a true artist and his professional work is simply perfect. He knew exactly where to shoot and how to use the lighting to capture all the best moments. One of my favorite things about our wedding was getting to know Thomas and seeing his magical work in real time. He's also so good at improvising at time of stress and I honestly don't know how he does it. The number one compliment we kept getting from our guests/family was how amazing our photographer was - so many people raved about him and he was easily our favorite vendor. Everyone was still talking about him long after the wedding was over. Thomas you are amazing. Thank you so much for making our magical day even more magical.

  * ### Thomas is the best wedding photographer handsdown!

•Verified review

•Chris G.•May 1, 2025

Thomas is the best! He is unbelievably talented and his communication throughout the entire process was clear, professional, and reassuring, which made everything so smooth and stress-free. He captured every special moment beautifully and from all the perfect angles. The photos are stunning and feel so natural and timeless. We’re so grateful to have these amazing memories to look back on, all thanks to his talent and eye for detail. He also included an engagement shoot that we had a couple of weeks before the wedding and those pictures are just unbelievably beautiful! He will tell you which poses to do and guide you to make sure the pictures come out perfect and natural. The number of pictures that he delivered was insane, and they’re all amazing! He sent over some pictures the day after the wedding and sent the complete list of pictures just a week after the wedding, which is an insane turnaround! He also had a couple of small cameras lying around and gave them to bridesmaids to capture their perspectives of our wedding. Thomas was the perfect person for the job and I highly recommend him if you’re looking for the absolute best wedding photographer! Several of our family and friends told us he is the best photographer they have ever seen as they watched him sprint all over the venue throughout the night to capture every single moment of our magical evening. That’s enough of me talking, you can take a look at some of the pictures he captured, his work is the best I’ve ever seen and it was an absolute pleasure to work with him!

Thomas was absolutely amazing on our special day! Everything was planned ahead of time to perfection. Locations were chosen, lighting was great and Thomas himself was an absolute joy to work with.

  * ### Highly recommend!

•Verified review

•Tracy S.•Apr 2, 2025

Thomas is truly one of a kind. We consider ourselves extremely lucky to have had him as our wedding photographer. Upon meeting Thomas, it was clear he had a calm, cool confidence - as the bride, this immediately put me at ease. Knowing my photographer had everything planned & under control, and I could just sit back & enjoy the moment? Priceless. He communicated clearly & made the (what can feel like) endless formal photos feel fun. It is one thing to think your photographer is great, but it is another to hear multiple accounts from family & guests as well. We feel confident that Thomas documented every second of our day - he was quite literally in multiple places at once, with several different types of cameras. He showed us photos as the day went on to make sure we liked the style. He took any remaining disposable cameras from our tables & was snapping pics towards the end of the night - this was above & beyond! Thank you, Thomas, for exceeding our expectations. If you are looking for an experienced, confident photographer, look no further.

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 1-3 weeks after your wedding. Within this time, you can also expect to receive a link directly to all of your files, so you can share the photos with your loved ones with one click.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

I accept bookings of any time frame; one week to one year it doesn't matter to me.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.
