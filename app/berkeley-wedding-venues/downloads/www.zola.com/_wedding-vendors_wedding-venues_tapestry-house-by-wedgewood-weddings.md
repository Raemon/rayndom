## About this venue

Tapestry House by Wedgewood Weddings offers a charming escape that'll make you feel right at home … literally! Just west of Fort Collins, this location is perfect for destination weddings and local FoCo weddings alike. And since its original build in 1890, the manor is still beaming with whimsical charm! Beside the lilac garden filled with blooming bushes, the grand, century-old trees create a serene environment for stunning photos. Host your reception in either the historic reception space or the modern pavilion, both boasting spacious floorplans allowing your guests to mingle!

•Verified review

•Spencer Z.•Nov 25, 2025

Tapestry House By Wedgewood Weddings was an absolute delight to work with for our wedding. From the moment we first reached out, their team was incredibly helpful, quick to respond, and transparent throughout the entire planning process. The venue itself is absolutely beautiful, with an elegant yet rustic charm that perfectly matched the vibe we were going for. The quality of their work and attention to detail was exceptional, and the value we received was unparalleled. We couldn't have dreamed of a more perfect setting for our special day, and are so grateful to the Tapestry House team for making it all come together seamlessly. Andrew and Emma did an amazing job at making our wedding a dream.

•Abigail N.•Oct 23, 2025

Recently got married at Tapestry House and my husband and I have zero regrets!! The whole process from start to finish was incredible, so easy to organize from states away. On the day of, it did end up raining at the ceremony time but the staff, Erin and McKenna and their team were quick to change our ceremony to inside and made it just beautiful. The venue itself is just stunning; it’s clean, the grounds are beautiful, and the staff did such an amazing job setting up our decorations for us. The food was amazing, our guests are still talking about it. Russell Logan our officiant was so eloquently spoken and so kind. All additional staff present were all pleasant and we had so much fun with them. I would get married all over again to get to experience this venue and their staff!

From the moment we first spoke with the team at Tapestry House, their communication was efficient, easy, responsive, and incredibly helpful. The venue itself is absolutely gorgeous, with a natural beauty that felt magical and perfect for our wedding day. The entire team anticipated our needs and was always available to ensure everything ran smoothly and according to plan. One of the things that made our experience so seamless was their planning portal — it made the whole process intuitive, organized, and so much less overwhelming. There were so many opportunities to personalize our day. The team gave us the flexibility to customize our package and add personal touches that made it truly our own. All of our guests were incredibly impressed by the beauty of the venue and the delicious food — it was an incredible experience that exceeded our expectations in every way.
