  * ### Amazing Officiant and DJ, Highly Recommend!

•Verified review

•Ryan M.•May 8, 2025

David was amazing! He provided three services for our wedding. He was our minister for the ceremony, the DJ during our reception, and his wife also ran a photo booth. My wife and I highly recommend their services. Leading up to our wedding day, David provided incredibly helpful suggestions in planning our ceremony and reception. In addition to the phone calls and emails, communicating all the details was made very simple through an online portal. It made selecting music and building out our ceremony and reception easy. My wife and I loved the speech he prepared for our ceremony and our guests all loved the music and photo booth. We gladly recommend their services to our family, friends, and anyone planning a wedding.
