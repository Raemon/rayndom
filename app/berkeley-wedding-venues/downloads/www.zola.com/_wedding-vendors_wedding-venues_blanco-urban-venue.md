## About this venue

Welcome. Blanco, an Urban Venue, is the Bay Area’s premier event space in historic downtown San Jose. This charming building has been transformed into a three-story and 8,000-square-foot blank canvas ideal for weddings, corporate & social events. Blanco has kept the allure of this historic building by refurbishing some of its original features, like its 150-year-old brick walls. Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, Blanco is a stylish space with an old-world appeal.

  * ### A Beautiful, Flexible Venue in Downtown San Jose

•Verified review

•Cher•Dec 18, 2025

Blanco Urban Venue was the perfect choice for our wedding. Located right in downtown San Jose, the space is modern, stylish, and beautifully designed, while still feeling warm and intimate. The venue is very flexible and worked especially well for our smaller guest count. The layout made it easy to host both the ceremony and reception seamlessly, and the urban setting added so much character to the day. The team was professional, responsive, and easy to work with throughout the planning process. On the wedding day, everything ran smoothly, allowing us to truly relax and enjoy the moment. If you’re looking for a chic downtown venue that’s versatile, well-located, and thoughtfully run, we highly recommend Blanco Urban Venue.

  * ### Best Venue!

•Verified review

•Haley & R.•Oct 13, 2025

We could not be happier with how our wedding at Blanco went! We were blown away by the hospitality of the team and how helpful they were in our entire process of planning a wedding 18 months out. When we toured, our favorite part was the 3 different levels and our guests said they loved that it felt like they were at 3 different venues in one place. The entire Blanco team truly made our wedding perfect and I could not imagine us getting married anywhere else.

  * ### Amazing space

•Verified review

•Justin•Oct 11, 2025

Great wedding venue located close to home, nestled in an easy access area with tons of amenities. You can truly make it your own. We chose modern tropical vibe, added a few pieces of decor some florals and the venue transformed to our theme. Our guests were blown away that this place existed and the setup. Event staff was on point with many guests saying that this was the best wedding they had ever been to, and I'd have to agree.

  * ### Absolutely Perfect Venue – A Dream Come True!

•Verified review

•Brianna F.•Sep 26, 2024

Blanco is a fantastic venue with an incredible team! The rooftop and mezzanine are gorgeous and the white walls provide a minimalist look that can be decorated to fit your theme. The great room with its giant chandelier was fanatic for our reception and dancing! Renee and the team were very helpful, responsive, and flexible as we planned the different parts of our wedding. They answered all of our questions and worked closely with our planner and other vendors to make our day spectacular. Would highly recommend!
