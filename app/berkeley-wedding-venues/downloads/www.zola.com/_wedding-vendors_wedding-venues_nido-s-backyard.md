•Anjuli M.•Nov 27, 2024

We had an amazing wedding at Nido's! The space is already so well curated we didn't do much decorating other than florals which was great. They offered amazing communication throughout the planning process and day of. Loved the outdoor covered space, especially on a hot day! Food and drinks were delicious too!
