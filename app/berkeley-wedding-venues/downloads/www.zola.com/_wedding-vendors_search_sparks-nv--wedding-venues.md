“The Sparks Water Bar was the perfect place for our wedding reception. You get to choose your menu (from pre-selected menu options), napkin colors, and floor plan to name a few. Everyone is so professional and helpful from the moment you start planning. The food was so delicious! The view of Reno/Sparks is beautiful and we highly recommend having your event in the evening where you can see the sunset and you have up until the restaurant bar closes. Because it was our wedding, we got to use the elevator rather than walk through the restaurant and it was helpful for our family members who were unable to walk up a flight of stairs. Any food allergies or preferences are accommodated to the best of their ability. Their focus is making sure you and your guests have a good time. To Samantha, Heather, and the staff working our event on May 29th 2022 we cannot thank you enough for making our reception so fun and memorable from start to finish.”Mariah & J., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/sparks-water-bar)

“When we pictured our dream wedding, we imagined something intimate, magical, and stress-free — and that’s exactly what we got at The Hytch at Sierra Water Gardens. We loved that we didn’t have to travel to Tahoe or elope somewhere far away just to have a beautiful setting. This venue is truly a hidden paradise in Reno. It’s quiet, lush, and tucked away from the chaos of the city, yet close enough to home that we never had to stress about logistics. From day one, Yeliz made us feel completely taken care of. She has this calm, confident energy that instantly puts you at ease. She’s full of creative ideas and had a solution or vendor connection for everything we dreamed up. We knew right away we were in the best hands. Planning was a breeze thanks to Gina, our amazing coordinator. She checked in often, answered every question without hesitation, and truly held our hand as the big day approached. She made all the nerves disappear. And then… the wedding day. We walked in and saw our vision fully brought to life — even more beautifully than we imagined. We still don’t know how Yeliz and her team pulled off everything so perfectly. We never had to worry about decorating or coordinating; we simply showed up and enjoyed our day, as did all our guests. Getting married here was the second easiest “yes” we’ve ever made — the first was saying yes to each other. Thank you, Yeliz, Gina, and the entire team at The Hytch at Sierra Water Gardens. You didn’t just give us a wedding — you gave us a memory we’ll cherish forever.”Iryna W., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/00f4e5bc-2374-405b-93b3-c66213f14735?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-hytch-at-sierra-water-gardens)
