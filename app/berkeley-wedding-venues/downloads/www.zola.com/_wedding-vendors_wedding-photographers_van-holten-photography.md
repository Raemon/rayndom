I'm a passionate photographer who finds joy in collaborating with creative minds to capture extraordinary moments. By day, I channel my expertise into high-quality construction work, while my artistic pursuits in photography allow me to explore my creativity and connect with others on a profound level.

Through my sessions, my main goal is for the couple to be in the moment, enjoy being in each others company, and not feel the pressure that alot of photographers seem to apply these days. My expertise in shooting film, choosing film stocks that cater to your special day, and weaving that in with a full digital gallery is one of my favorite things. Developing locally in the bay area, youll never see me slapping a film filter on a photo and calling it a day. I take great pride in what i shoot and how i shoot it

  * ### Amazing photos and film! 

•Verified review

•Megan•Aug 12, 2025

Van Holten Photography was an excellent choice for our wedding photography. From the first time we spoke with Will, his communication was quick, helpful, and responsive whether by text or phone. On the day of our wedding, Will made us feel super comfortable and was able to capture some truly wonderful shots. The quality of the photos was outstanding, with great lighting that really highlighted the details of our special day. We have continued to use Will for our pregnancy and family photo shoots and have been very pleased both with him as a person and the overall value and quality of his work. We highly recommend Van Holten Photography for any couple looking for an experienced, talented, and personable wedding photographer.

From start to finish, working with Will was so refreshing. Not only is he incredibly talented, but he also has a truly artistic eye that brings every photo to life. Every single image he delivered was stunning, beautifully composed, full of emotion, and captured with such an authentic feel. What really stood out to us was how effortless and seamless the entire photography process felt. Will has this calm and warm energy that instantly put us (and everyone else) at ease. During the bridesmaids' photoshoot, he created such a fun, relaxed atmosphere - it honestly felt more like hanging out with a friend than posing for pictures! He encouraged us to be ourselves, let loose, and enjoy the moment, and the result was a set of natural, joyful, and candid shots that we’ll cherish forever. It felt like Will was genuinely part of the celebration — laughing with us, hyping us up - you could tell he genuinely loves what he does and was fully present with us in the moment. His enthusiasm was infectious, and it felt like he was celebrating right alongside us, which made the whole experience even more special. He was also incredibly patient and professional throughout the day. Never once did we feel rushed or staged, he took his time to get the right shots while making sure we stayed present and enjoyed the experience. I genuinely cannot recommend Will enough. His talent speaks for itself, but it’s his personality, passion, and dedication that make him truly exceptional. If you’re looking for someone who will not only take beautiful photos but also enhance your wedding day experience, Will is 100% the one. We’d recommend him a million times over!

  * ### Will is awesome 

•Verified review

•Leyla S.•Jul 25, 2025

We hadn’t met Will until after our wedding unfortunately! But we did get pregnant and were looking for someone that knew their way around a film camera. He suggested that we shoot at Joaquin Miller Forest. Little did he know, that’s where my husband and I had our first date! We had such a fun time running around the misty trees. The photos came out like a cinematic dream. Just the vibe I was going for. Thanks again Will!

Will is the best! He took our engagement photos and they turned out more beautiful than we ever imagined. The perfect mix of candid and posed—he truly captured the feeling of the day!

## Frequently asked questions

2 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically couples book with me 6-8 months in advance. This gives plenty of time for an engagement session, planning, scouting, shot list creation, and coordination. I do accept bookings up to 2 months in advance but prefer a little more heads up in order to insure that my clients have the best experience possible!

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My team and I do our best to get previews of your special day within 24 hours of key moments. We deliver full edits within 10 days of your session including any touch ups or tweaks you may request :)
