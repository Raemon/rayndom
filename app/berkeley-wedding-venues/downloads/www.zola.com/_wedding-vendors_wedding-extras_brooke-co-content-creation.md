  * ### Behind the scenes queen!

•Verified review

•Theresa L.•Dec 23, 2025

We hired Brooke as our social media content creator to capture behind the scenes moments of our wedding day, post in real time on Instagram, and record ready to post videos throughout the celebrations. She did a phenomenal job in meeting and exceeding our expectations! Brooke has extensive experience in the wedding industry, and she was very helpful in her role (and beyond). I’d recommend her to any bride!

  * ### AMAZING!!

•Verified review

•Christine•Dec 18, 2025

Brooke was phenomenal!! We used her as a content creator for our wedding on 11-8-24 at the Fenway!! If you’re on the fence about a content creator, I’d definitely do it! We hired her for 7 hours and she did an amazing job! She was extremely personable and got all of the behind the scenes from our special day. She sent us a ton of videos and pictures the night of our wedding. She sent us 3 reels in less than a week after the wedding! I’ll cherish this videos and pictures forever!!

Brooke & Co. Content Creation was an invaluable partner in making our wedding day truly special. From the start, their communication style was open, encouraging, and focused on problem-solving. As raw, romantic experts in content creation, they provided high-quality services that relieved a lot of stress during the wedding coordination process. Their work capturing the unique beauty and emotion of our day was exactly what we had envisioned. It was amazing to have so much content to look back on and see our wedding through someone else’s eyes. It was worth every penny! We are so grateful to Brooke & Co. for helping to make our wedding unforgettable.

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### What is the difference between a videographer and content creator?

A videographer and a wedding content creator differ mainly in their purpose, style, and final deliverables. A videographer focuses on producing a polished, cinematic film using professional cameras, audio equipment, and editing techniques to capture the key moments of the day in a timeless, high-quality format. A wedding content creator uses an iPhone to document candid, behind-the-scenes moments and create short-form, social media–ready videos. Content creators emphasize immediacy, trends, and casual, authentic footage designed for platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Couples often hire both to cover the day from different perspectives

### Do you replace a photographer?

No we do not! A wedding content creator doesn’t replace a photographer because their roles, skills, and outputs serve completely different purposes. Photographers are trained to capture high-resolution, professionally composed images that can be printed, framed, and preserved for decades. Content creators, on the other hand, focus on capturing candid, behind-the-scenes moments and producing short, trendy videos for social media using our iPhones. Our content is fun, immediate, and casual, but not intended to replace the quality, artistry, and permanence of professional photography.

### How quickly will we receive our content?

You will receive an Apple shared album invite request within 24 hours of your wedding day! If you do not have an iPhone we can also send the files via WeTransfer. Edited content will be delivered within 72 hours.

### Do you travel?

Yes we do! We are located in Orlando, Florida but often also serve Tampa, St Pete, St Augustine & Beyond. We’ve had the incredible opportunity to capture a wedding on a cruise to the Bahamas! We are passport and travel ready. Please inquire for a custom proposal for travel coverage.
