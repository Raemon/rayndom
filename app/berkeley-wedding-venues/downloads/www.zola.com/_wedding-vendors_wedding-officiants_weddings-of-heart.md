As Dr. Lili Goodman Freitas, a non-denominational wedding officiant since 1983, I bring over 40 years of heartfelt experience to your special day in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. Specializing in Marriage, Renewal of Vows, and Commitment ceremonies, I provide a unique blend of grace, insight, and humor, ensuring your union is celebrated with the reverence and joy it deserves.

Since 1983, I've brought a unique blend of expertise from my background as an educator, counselor, and minister, coupled with advanced degrees in Social Work, Psychology, Folklore-Folklife, and Spiritual Science. This extensive foundation allows me to craft ceremonies that are not only sacred and deeply personal but also infused with grace, insight, and humor, genuinely supporting couples as they embark on their married life.
