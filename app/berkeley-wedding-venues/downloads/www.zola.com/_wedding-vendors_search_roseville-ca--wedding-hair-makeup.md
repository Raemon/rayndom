I have known Jasmine before she became Jasmine&Co and she has always had such a kind and helpful spirit. She was the easiest decision with my wedding planning process and I had 2 big events to prepare for. Always had good recommendations for local vendors too! I had Jasmine for my pre wedding and day of event and I loved my looks! What I absolutely appreciated is how hectic wedding planning gets jasmine always assured me that everything will be okay! She also helped me create a hotel block in hawaii for my destination wedding and gather ideas for my big day! The only thing I wasn’t able to get done was a trial but the day of my wedding and henna events she knew what I needed and I felt so beautiful! I believe I was her first destination bride and she did so well even being pregnant made time to finish every single person and even last minute touch ups for family. 10/10 would recommend Jasmin and Co and count her as your hype girl for every event!

The face beater- Tanya 5.0

  * Team of 3
  * Starts at $1,400 
  * Serves Roseville, CA

I fell in love with makeup in 2013, and have since then made moves to elevate and educate myself in this industry. I have beat hundreds of faces over the years, and have gained skills and practices to keep up with trends. I would love to service you in your upcoming special occasion, so please, send me a message!“Tanya was an absolute dream to work with for my wedding day beauty needs, and I honestly don’t know what I would have done without her. From the very first interaction, she made me feel comfortable and cared for. She was open to feedback, quick to respond to all of my questions, and always made me feel like my concerns truly mattered. That kind of attentiveness is rare, and it immediately gave me confidence that I was in the best hands. Her work was nothing short of fantastic. The quality of her artistry was top-tier, especially considering her very reasonable price point. But what really stood out was the way Tanya went above and beyond. She surprised us by doing my grandmother’s makeup at no additional charge, even though it wasn’t part of the original plan. That small act of kindness meant so much to me and my family. My grandmother can be a bit particular, and many people struggle to work with her, but Tanya approached her with patience, gentleness, and genuine warmth. The result was stunning—my grandmother looked radiant and felt so special, which added another layer of joy to the day. On a personal level, Tanya made me feel beautiful in a way I hadn’t expected. As a plus-sized bride, I had some initial worries about how I would look and whether I’d feel confident in front of everyone. Tanya instantly put those fears to rest. Her sweet and funny personality made me feel at ease. By the time she finished, I felt not only gorgeous but also completely myself—comfortable, happy, and ready to shine. She didn’t just connect with me, either. Tanya got along wonderfully with the entire wedding party, bringing laughter and lightness to what could have been a stressful morning. She created such a positive, fun atmosphere that set the tone for the rest of the day. Her talent, professionalism, kindness, and heart made all the difference. I cannot recommend her highly enough—if you’re looking for someone who will not only make you look beautiful but also make you feel beautiful, Tanya is the one.”Victoria D., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/4aa14213-24a3-4cea-8fa4-00c3f16e777a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/the-face-beater-tanya)

From facials leading up to the wedding to on-site glam that’s designed for cameras and real life, I help you look and feel like the most elevated version of yourself. I manage the timeline, keep the energy grounded and fun, and make sure you’re fully taken care of from the moment we arrive.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Kate did my wedding makeup and I still don’t really have words, she just got me. I wanted to feel like myself, not overly done, and she totally understood the vibe! what stuck with me more was the energy she brought. At one point, a song came on that hit me hard (didn’t expect to cry during glam, but here we are), and without saying a word, Kate was just there…. quietly davbing my tears with a napkin, making sure everything stayed perfect. It meant a lot, bc I felt like I got to know her a lot while she was doing my makeup.. and by the end, I. Honestly wanted her to stay!! I’m writing this because I want more people to find her. She’s really good at what she does, and she actually cares.”Helena J., 7 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/foxy-glamour)

I absolutely love getting to be a part of such a big day for so many amazing couples! I have loved everything beauty related since I was little, trying to secretly cut my friends hair thinking their parents wouldn’t notice, always being the last person to get ready because you’re too busy getting everyone else ready. This has been my calling and my passion for as long as I remember. But really the best part is getting to meet so many amazing women and helping them create memories that will last a lifetime.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“There are not enough words to describe how happy I am to have worked with Kayli for my wedding! She went above and beyond to help make me both look and feel beautiful on my wedding day, and I was extremely grateful for her. Kayli is talented, professional, kind, and did an outstanding job. She was very communicative and worked with me prior to the wedding to make sure we achieved the look I wanted, offered advice and guidance, and she delivered exactly what I was imagining. I cannot recommend her enough. Thank you, Kayli, for making me look beautiful on my wedding day!”Apryl G., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/hairbylaurenkayli)

I had zero issues working with them. I don't mean that in a way where there were small things I didn't like but looked over-NO. I truly had zero issues with both of them or any of the people on their team for the day of hair and make up services. Before my big day, I booked two separate hair and make up trials where I asked for completely different things and at either trials they both arrived on time and did exactly the look I asked for. Then, the WEEKEND OF my wedding I realized I couldn't exactly pick between the two different looks and I humbly asked if Josiah could somehow combine the two looks from my trials for a "soft glam" look and he delivered. I have never felt so pretty. Same exact situation with my hair. Josiah and Paige were so patient and friendly and kind! There team worked quickly and efficiently on the day of my wedding to do hair and make up for most of my bridal party plus my mother and my mother in law- and a surprise person who changed her mind from doing her own make up to asking for it done! We even got little personalized touch up kits to reapply any lipstick or pin up any additional hair. I highly highly recommend this team of amazing professionals. I never leave review s for anything but they all should be recognized for their dedicated work. Thank you forever to this team, specifically Josiah and Paige who helped me look and feel so beautiful on my special day.”Jessica S., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/026d2490-e064-44d8-a26a-2028392374dd?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/awaken-beauty)

On-site traveling hair + makeup artist of 8 years based in the Greater Sacramento area and beyond!! Specializing in enhancing your features with natural and soft glam and giving you the hairstyle of your dreams for your big day!“I recently had the pleasure of working with Betty Sotelo, and I couldn't be more thrilled with the experience! After a challenging search for the right hairstylist, I found Betty on Zola.com, and she truly stood out from the rest. From the moment I reached out, Betty was incredibly quick to respond and went above and beyond to accommodate my schedule. On the day of my appointment, she arrived promptly and was nothing short of professional. Her expertise and attention to detail made me feel confident and relaxed throughout the entire process. What truly impressed me was that Betty brought along hairpieces just in case the bride forgot hers—which, as luck would have it, I did! This thoughtful touch made all the difference, and I absolutely loved it. Not only did she listen carefully to my preferences, but she also provided valuable suggestions that enhanced my look. The results were fantastic, and I couldn’t be happier with my hair! I highly recommend Betty Sotelo to anyone looking for a talented and dedicated hairstylist. She has a true gift for her craft, and I can’t wait to book my next appointment with her.
