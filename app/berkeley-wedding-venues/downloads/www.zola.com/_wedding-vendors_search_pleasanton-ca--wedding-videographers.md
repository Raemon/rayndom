Casey Peek is the founder of Peek Media, where he crafts cinematic, story-driven wedding films with an authentic, documentary touch. Based in the Bay Area, Casey captures real moments with heart and artistry, creating films that let you feel your day all over again.“Peek Media captured the vibe of our small wedding in a way that’s allowed us to go back and relive the day time and time again. They were a natural and unobtrusive fit during the actual day. Their videographers were easy to work with and blended into the background. Despite their minimalist presence they managed to get all of the rights shots to capture the most important moments throughout the ceremony and reception. We were impressed that our videos managed to include all of our guests and gave us a sense of what was going on at places that we didn’t have the time to be at during the actual day. As a bonus they worked well with our photographer and other vendors. They were a natural part of the overall program and contributed towards lowering stress and keeping the day moving along seamlessly. We were thrilled with a short recap video included in our package that was edited to a main song we used in our wedding- easily accessible to share with family and friends. Thank you for creating great memories for us!”Laura & O., 19 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/3f47ca30-3427-4267-b40e-8ca97b348bd0?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/peek-media)

We researched as much as we could and visited lots of websites to look at examples of different styles. We narrowed it down to a few choices but after we both had a chance to speak with Sebastien we were sure which way we wanted to go. He was a big help in deciding on what services we needed. The day of the wedding he was great to work with and was able to blend into our group and catch some amazing moments that we would have never been able to see ourselves. He also set up some great staged shots including our first look which he captured amazingly. We did have a few video clips that we wanted slight alterations to and he was able to make that happen with no problems. All in all Interstellar Films provided everything we could have asked for in our wedding videographer. Sebastien took amazing video and was attentive to all our requests during and after our special day. I would definitely recommend using him for your upcoming video needs.”Clara S., 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/interstellar-films)

People ask us what inspired us to begin filming weddings... It actually all started with our own! We were absolutely blown away with our own wedding film. It was cinematic, beautiful, and totally embodied our personalities and the significance behind our wedding. Our videographers were absolutely wonderful, and actually ended becoming lasting friends of ours. It was our experience with them (and our continued friendship with them and other incredible videographers) that inspired us to take the leap, develop our skills and begin capturing couples' weddings. We've since filmed almost 150 weddings and are loving every second.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Vow and Covenant perfectly captured the essence, the memories, and all the highlights of our wedding day!

I’m Colin Pattison, owner and filmmaker at Featherstone Wedding Films. I film weddings because I believe in the power of marriage, and I have a passion for capturing special moments on film. I’ve helped countless couples create their ideal wedding film for over 10 years. My goal is to capture lasting memories through beautiful, personalized wedding films. From first consultation, to finished film, I’ll be with you every step of the way.“Colin was probably one of the easiest vendors to work with. We chatted on the phone to get to know him, sent him our deposit and that was that! We talked a bit leading up to the wedding, but he and my photographer communicated to get on the same page/ timeline so I didn’t have to stress much about that either. The day of, him and his team were wonderful all day. They themselves were professional, and all his gear was as well. One of the things I appreciated most about Colin was his ability to be everywhere to get footage, but he was secretive about it, so those that are shy on camera didn’t feel pressured. My videos I got were AMAZING. I don’t know how many times we have watched the videos together or how many I’ve watched it alone but, every time feels like the first. It’s beautiful work and truly captured our wedding day and our personalities. We also got raw footage from him that had us cackling. It’s awesome seeing the day again through both the finished product and the raw footage. Thank you Colin for everything. I highly recommend Colin to everyone!!”Aubrey G., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/d109b045-b058-4538-8d42-2fbbe8366a5b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/featherstone-wedding-films)

We just had our second wedding anniversary and we honestly still sit and watch it together regularly!

So what does finisterre mean? Finisterre is Latin. If you know some Spanish, you’ll recognize two words squeezed into one: “fin” and “tierra,” essentially meaning the world’s end. Don’t worry, not in an apocalyptic sense of the word — it’s actually a place. It’s where the Romans once stood in modern-day Spain. They looked across the vast Atlantic Ocean, and thought to themselves “is this the end of the road?” Finisterre is an ode to that majestic feeling of unknown. Getting married is one of those unique experiences.“This review is long overdue and for that we apologize! We hired Ryan and his team to be our videographers for our wedding at the Corner Barn in Graeagle, CA this past July and are so thankful for our decision. Ryan was the main videographer and brought an additional shooter. Between the two of them, they got absolutely amazing footage. Ryan is a mastermind with putting the footage all together and turning it into one beautiful video. All the little details were brought together in such an artful way that we are so impressed with. We loved his style of video, especially the documentary part. He interviewed important people, such as family members, MOH, and BM, at different parts throughout our special day and had those included in the video as well. Ryan was so kind and communicative throughout the whole process. It was obvious how knowledgeable and passionate he was and we were so comfortable working with him and trusting him with our most special day. He did a great job of thinking of every detail to make it special. Once the video was done, my husband and I received a portable video player that showed his work and it was such a great surprise!

  * Storytelling style
  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

I started Matter Video because I am passionate about people and making videos. I want to make videos that matter (I promise that is the only time I will use that play on words in this section). My goal is to create videos that capture moments and stories that are significant to you: your wedding day, your organization, your company, your story. I have been making videos since 2000 and I teach Leadership at a local high school. When I am not making videos, I like to travel and spend time with my wife and 3 kids. They are much cuter than me.“Dan and his team are wonderful. We looked far and wide for a videographer who’s work felt representative of the way a wedding day should feel - real, emotional, joyous, fun and man, did he deliver!! We are so thankful to have 2 fully edited and beautiful videos from our day (he sends 1 teaser vid the day after the wedding which was a complete and welcome surprise for us to wake up to the next day! We watched in bed a few times and cried a lot of happy tears haha). The cherry on top is how chill of a person Dan and Johnny were. Their energy was really relaxed but also professional. We felt completely comfortable being with them and at ease knowing that they had everything under control. Thank you a million times over again for capturing our day Matter Video! We are so grateful for the gift you’ve given us and to be able to relive our day for many many many years to come.”Kelsie M., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/matter-video)

Hi! Courtney here (that's me on the left!). Shutter and Sound is the brainchild of renowned wedding videographer Ryan Geldermann. Ryan began his wedding videography career in 2010 in Los Angeles and quickly became recognized as one of the top videographers in the U.S.. After relocating to DC and still receiving countless inquiries from all corners of the country, Ryan decided to recruit and train a few talented friends so he could continue offering the quality wedding videography he’s known for in SoCal and eventually over 10 cities. Shutter and Sound is a very small group of filmmakers dedicated to turning your big day into a work of art.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I had the pleasure of working with Kaylee and Alexis as the planner for a wedding in South Georgia.
