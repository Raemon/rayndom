  * ### We loved our wedding at Hacienda De las Flores!

•Verified review

•Vira F.•Oct 26, 2025

We loved working with our Hacienda De Las Flores team for our wedding! Johnny was our day of coordinator wand was wonderful. With our schedules being so busy we could not imagine planning this wedding without the WW team which for us took care of most things for us (food, decor, drinks, DJ). We appreciated the planning materials, binder, meetings which helped keep us on track. As my sister joked even if we did nothing, the wedding would still be great! We went with the recommended florist (A love is in bloom) and bakery (Old towne danville) and thought both were wonderful. We did chose our own Officiant and Photographer however. The venue is gorgeous and the weather thankfully cooperated for a beautiful early fall day. They were great about working with us and our decor ideas and playlist ideas. We loved our wedding! The only downside to be aware of is the noise ordinance which prevents use of microphones in the outdoor patio during reception (only pre-recorded sound/speech is ok). this was not ideal but we knew this was the case when we booked the venue because it is that gorgeous. We did speeches indoors in the dance hall which worked out fine though not ideal. We also had a tiny sound mishap during our grand entrance due to the pre-recorded nature of things but overall not a big deal. Overall think this venue is awesome and would recommend though of course depends on what's most important to you!

  * ### Instructions Not Followed

•Verified review

•Caroline•Oct 2, 2025

While we enjoyed the attentiveness of their staff to us (the bride and groom) on the day of our wedding, they did not follow several of our special instructions, which we had communicated to staff in multiple meetings, to the point where we deeply question the point of those meetings. MANY were out of place from where we had discussed and diagrammed, like the gifts table and baby picture collages. They had also seemingly forgotten entirely the sunglasses we wanted to be available to guests right by the entrance to the ceremony space. For example, I communicated in multiple meetings (albeit to two different day-of coordinator there who were swapped out the week before the wedding) that I did NOT want an unplugged ceremony. I had paid for this polaroid-style app for people to share photos from their perspective as guests and I wanted guests to use/upload to the app to capture different angles. Not only did they not put the sign where I had asked them to, they had the DJ (to whom I had also advised I didn’t want an unplugged ceremony) announce for people to put their phones away. People who saw the sign (which was not where we had asked for it to be placed) later told us they were confused by this contradiction. So it ended up that only 3 people used the app that night, which was pretty disappointing. They also somehow couldn’t find gifts a guest had left at our sweetheart table. And the leftover desserts we specially ordered, were conveniently NOT packed up for us and seemingly disappeared. We also were not pleased that guests had to pay for top shelf liquor when we paid for an open bar.

  * ### Thank you Hacienda!

•Verified review

•Fancypanci•Jun 6, 2025

Best Day Ever! We had the most incredible wedding at Hacienda De Las Flores. The outdoor setting was absolutely beautiful, and everything went perfectly. The staff were amazing and made the day stress-free. Couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate — truly the best day ever!

  * ### A Wonderful Whimsical Wedding Venue

•Verified review

•Rachael A.•Jun 27, 2024

We had a wonderful wedding - the Wedgewood team helped us create a meaningful ceremony and reception. The pictures online do not do this place justice - you have to see it for yourself! The grounds are beautiful; we had our ceremony at the pavilion and our reception in the garden area / in their indoor hall area. The venue definitely felt like a fairy / cottage core dream to me! Wedgewood also vendors that work with them and provide really excellent services - florals, music, cakes. If you want to have an awesome wedding and reduce your stress, I would check this place out.
