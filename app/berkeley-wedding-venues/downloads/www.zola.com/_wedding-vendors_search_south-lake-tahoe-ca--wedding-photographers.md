  * Serves South Lake Tahoe, CA

Specializing in Outdoor Weddings and Elopements! Growing up fishing and hiking at the age of three, I spend as much time as possible outside! Searching out new swimming holes in the summer, traveling to the mountains and along the coast throughout the year! Backpacking, hiking and climbing. Quickly adding more locations to shoot!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Dustin did an absolutely amazing job on our wedding photos. He was professional throughout the entire process from booking to receiving our massive gallery (well over 1k photos). Dustin did a great job in communicating with the wedding guest s and wedding party, he made sure to have a list of the photos we wanted to have taken and checked in with us throughout the day to make sure all photos were getting taken. Our photos our absolutely beautiful and I’m so incredibly happy with Dustin and his work.”Erica C., a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/ef955149-ea31-4f13-a32d-f794a2700f8c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/dustin-wheeler-photography)

Te Dua Weddings 5.0

  * Classic style
  * Starts at $1,200 
  * Serves South Lake Tahoe, CA
  * Offer

I started shooting photos and video in Greece, and since moving to the US, I have dedicated myself to shooting weddings, elopements and engagements. I love being able to capture the love that my couples have for each other and the unique energy each couple has. I am always down to shoot in new locations and find the best place for my shoots!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From the very first phone call, Enea set the tone for everything that followed. We’re not “picture people” at all, so the idea of an engagement shoot at San Francisco City Hall had us both quietly panicking. Enea’s warmth, humor, and genuine conversation melted every ounce of awkwardness away. We laughed more than we posed, and somehow walked out with **stunning, frame-worthy shots** that still make us grin. My husband loved them so much he had them printed and sewn onto the lining of the vest he wore on our wedding day – talk about a keepsake! Come the wedding day, Te Dua’s team was a dream. We got all the classic staged portraits we wanted, but what stole our hearts were the candid, in-the-moment captures: friends tearing up the dance floor, champagne toasts mid-laugh, family members just having a good time every second of joy preserved forever. And then there’s Luke, the videographer – wow. The highlight film he delivered is straight out of a Hollywood romance. The editing, the music, the pacing… it’s an emotional roller-coaster that replays the entire day in under ten minutes. I’ve watched it on repeat and cry every single time. Turnaround wasn’t instant, but every second of the wait was worth it. The quality, care, and artistry shine through in every photo and frame of video. Te Dua Weddings Photography isn’t just a vendor – they’re memory-makers. If you want to relive your day with tears of happiness for years to come, book them. 10/10, no hesitation, highly recommend!”Da'Shawn W., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/b124dd5f-038e-42b1-b661-f5df2369e453?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/enea-strora-photography-and-videography)

  * Starts at $4,000 
  * Serves South Lake Tahoe, CA

I’m Carissa, a California-based wedding photographer specializing in true-to-color editing, candid documentary coverage, and natural, editorial-style portraits. My work focuses on real connection, emotional storytelling, and the in-between moments that define a wedding day. With more than a decade of experience, I photograph weddings with an intentional, relaxed approach that helps couples feel comfortable, authentic, and fully present. My husband, Tyler, joins me as our videographer, bringing the same warm, storytelling-driven style to every celebration.“We had so much fun on our wedding day with Carissa, Tyler, and team. Beyond having a blast taking photos, we felt comfortable and the direction given was so easy to follow. They really make you feel like a model! The photos Carissa gave us hang proudly on many different walls in our home, and the video Tyler made is always something we watch each year on our anniversary. Very special team, highly recommend!”Katie, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/7fc297dd-801f-4fe1-9b7f-59414a8c4636?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/dream-capture-studios)

They were extremely comfortable and friendly while working with us and taking photos. Even when it came down to the dogs, 2 of which were panicking because they are rescues and being around so many people stressed them out, this didn't even phase the Sound Originals team which impressed me the most. Their professionalism with their gear was truly amazing to see (we have some professional photographers in our family who were commenting on this too), you could tell they knew how to handle their equipment. One thing that I loved was that they took the time to create cute photogenic moments to capture with the camera that would normally be over so fast, you would probably miss it. Every photo, from the goofy spur of the moment reactions - to the posed adorable moments, came out beautifully. Thank you Sound Originals for working with us! We couldn't have asked for better photographers.”Heaven B., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/46499f0e-d1b1-4de8-b5fb-061aab854959?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/sound-originals-photo-video)

Daniel Cewinski Photography 5.0 South Lake Tahoe, CA

  * Classic style

I am really interested in other people. I like to find out about you. I believe we all have value, and everybody deserves to be happy. Sour Pusses are quite the bummer, and seriousness is overrated. I really believe there should be very little reason for people to not get along. EVERYONE is welcome. I LOVE nostalgia, and having my work appreciated enough to be on your walls is the best feeling. I roast my own coffee, I am a friek for Legos, old black and white movies, the ocean, the forest, the jungle, and chatting with people.“It was serendipitous that I came across Daniel's instagram randomly in the early stages of wedding planning, and the most recent photos happened to be from the venue we'd chosen so it was clear he knew the venue and that his pictures were magical. Our wedding planners were thrilled that we had found him as they have all worked together and have a great working relationship. Daniel is exuberant and brings such authentic enthusiasm to his work. He was super helpful in the day of planning, and on the day managed our timeline with great efficiency and professionalism. All of our guests were highly impressed at his commitment to getting every shot both posed and candid of us, our families, and portraits of our guests. My husband's most important moment to capture was sunset and our sunset photos are beyond stunning.

Hey, I'm so glad you're here! My name is Heather and I live in beautiful Foresthill, CA. I love any and all hard seltzers, my Great Dane Fritz, and using my camera to capture all the feels. About my business? Well I'm basically a professional wedding crasher, so you know you will always have fun with me! Oh and I've pretty much cried at every wedding I've ever been to...and yours is no exception. Let's be friends!“Heather was wonderful to work with! We are the awkward type in front of a camera, but working with Heather made everything seem so stress-free during our wedding planning and photo sessions. Our engagement photo session was fun and care-free and we unbeknownst to all of us, she actually ended up taking beautiful photos of our beautiful rabbit, Trixie before she passed on the following month. Something that we truly appreciated and will never forget. For our wedding, Heather was very detailed and gave us a run down of what to expect for the photos. Nothing was hidden and she was up front about it all and asked if we wanted to add anything as well. Although Mother Nature had other plans for the day, we were still able to get the majority of our photos done. She even snuck in polaroid photos that were just too adorable - And I have no idea when she even took them! We received our wedding photos back and everyone absolutely loves them. I just love her style. While there are some photographers who do a large amount of filter/presets (no shade to those who do), there's just something about Heather's style of being able to keep it clean and natural that I just love! With Mother Nature having other plans with making it a misty ceremony and a downpour reception, we did miss out on doing a handful of photos of cocktail hour. Because of that, Heather was quick to offer us a bridal session to take some additional photos to complete our wedding. Instead of returning to the venue, we actually decided to relocate to Fort Bragg and take photos at the Mendocino Garden. The photos turned out absolutely gorgeous with the oceanic background and the dahlias that she chose to work with. She made everything seem so light-hearted and there was so much laughter with each session. Thank you Heather for everything you did throughout our wedding planning and so much more. You've captured so many wonderful moments and we couldn't have asked for a better photographer!”Phuong D., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/1620589a-9012-42ca-a075-18db4560d549?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/heather-blackwood-photography)

  * Classic style
  * Serves South Lake Tahoe, CA

Hi! I’m Azaria. I am a Northern California-based Travel Wedding and Elopement photographer. How did I get here? I grew up in small-town Nebraska with a love for adventure and photography. I got to explore those passions when I got married, my husband joined the military, and we got stationed overseas. I used that opportunity to travel and see many countries. When we returned stateside, I pursued my passion for photography by getting my degree at Brooks Institute of Photography.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Azaria! Where do I start when it comes to her and her as a photographer!? She genuinely has been phenomenal all the way around. Not just as a professional photographer but also someone who wants and gives her clients her 110% best and it absolutely shows! She's been insanely patient with me and very reassuring too. Although I am her client who booked her for our engagement photo's and wedding, I have to say there is not a single individual who could compare to the work she's provided. Her confidence, communication, professionalism and reassurance is definitely top tier!! I have total faith in her and what she does, that I wouldn't change a single thing or have it any other way! Her photo's are proof! Her personality is proof. She is so approachable but professional as well as understanding that it was very easy for me to gravitate to her. I know from the moment we had our phone consultation that I knew I just had to have her. Her photo's are gorgeous and the fact I can be so comfortable and be myself makes the photo's even better. Like think about it? If you can't have a client relationship with who your hiring as an important key to your day is it really worth it? Yeah there's a ton of photographers out there but Azaria, I dont regret her and her work for a single second. When she tells you it's about you and what you want what... she means that from the heart. Not to mention she's such a good hype person to have in your corner. I adore this woman so much and her work that I'm already planning on doing photo's with her for when my husband to be and I have our 1st wedding anniversary! She's got an eye for photography and a passion that runs deep in her heart! When I say I recommend her, I truly mean I recommend her without a single doubt!”Jennifer M., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/ba40c658-9e0c-4ca9-a0ff-8c20c58cde37?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/azaria-chavira-photography)

I’ve had a camera in my hand since I can remember. On family vacations each of us had a camera and would come back with several rolls of film. It was great to see different perspectives of the same place. My photos became more refined throughout my childhood as I graduated to my stepdad’s Minolta film SLR. In college I dedicated myself to photography professionally with a degree in photojournalism, then found my calling with a wedding studio at 19.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Nicky Byrnes Photography was the perfect choice for our wedding photographer.

I have always had a passion for photography and once I picked up a camera, it was all over. I was raised from a big family and my kids are my world! Born and raised in the Bay Area, I have a special love for being back there. I consider myself very outgoing and will always try and make you laugh and feel comfortable by being a huge dork. I think that is one of the biggest compliments I get is that my clients always feel relaxed and at ease and I love hearing that. Not to mention becoming friends with my clients which is an added bonus! ​“Jeff was amazing! He made everyone feel comfortable in front of the camera and went above and beyond to “get the shot!” He has an amazing eye for detail, angle and creative shots I never would have thought of. We had a ton of fun with him getting some epic shots but also some silly ones too! I will be using him as our family photographer from here on out!”Michelle S., 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/jeff-hall-photography)
