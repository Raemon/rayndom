Alejo Photo + Film is a husband and wife photo and video duo. We love love and adventure, and we especially love combining the two! We are trilingual (English, Spanish, Japanese) and experienced travelers. We offer digital photo and video, drone footage, 35mm film photos, and super 8mm film videos.

We aren't your traditional wedding photography style. We love to capture editorial photos as well as the day's raw emotions. Incorporating film helps us do that and adds a level of fun anticipation to your final gallery! Until that delivery day, though, we always send a sneak peek within 48 hours!

## Frequently asked questions

8 Answers

Ask them a question

### How many photos will we receive in our final gallery?

I do not limit the amount of photos I edit and deliver. I cull the unusable photos (test shots, blurry pictures, mid-sneeze photos) and edit all the good ones. While I don't guarantee a specific amount, my full-day galleries typically contain 600-1700 photos depending on the amount of hours I've been hired for and what the timeline consists of. Delays in start times, travel between locations, etc can decrease the number of photos I snap, but you can rest easy knowing I won't hold back any good pictures!

### Why do your packages have a range of prices?

The base price for my full-day packages cover that amount of hours, an engagement session in Missouri (for 8- and 10-hour packages), an online gallery, a USB, and 48 hour sneak peeks. On top of that, you can add vintage film photos, super 8 film video, a second shooter, and/or an engagement session if your package doesn't include one. Each add-on has it's own a la carte price.

### Do you also offer video services?

Yes! I offer super 8 film videos, and my AMAZING husband does digital videography. I can't recommend his work enough and I'd love for you to check out his own page: Alejo Photo + Film | Videography

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

You will receive a 48-hour sneak peek! My full gallery turnaround time varies by season. I always note an 8-week deadline in my client contract in case of an emergency. However, my goal is always to deliver sooner than the due date! In off-peak seasons, I average a 3-week turnaround. Peak seasons, the average is usually 5-weeks.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, full-day wedding couples book me about 13 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame. I only book weekend micro-weddings one-month out to reserve my most popular days for full-day events, but you're welcome to reach out anytime for weekday elopements!

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

To date, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

I offer a second shooter as an add-on to any package. My second shooters are trusted colleagues in terms of professionalism, camera knowledge, and creativity.
