  * ### AMAZING

•Verified review

•Jessica S.•Jul 3, 2025

I was lucky enough to work with Josiah and Paige for my wedding in February and they were outright amazing. I had zero issues working with them. I don't mean that in a way where there were small things I didn't like but looked over-NO. I truly had zero issues with both of them or any of the people on their team for the day of hair and make up services. Before my big day, I booked two separate hair and make up trials where I asked for completely different things and at either trials they both arrived on time and did exactly the look I asked for. Then, the WEEKEND OF my wedding I realized I couldn't exactly pick between the two different looks and I humbly asked if Josiah could somehow combine the two looks from my trials for a "soft glam" look and he delivered. I have never felt so pretty. Same exact situation with my hair. Josiah and Paige were so patient and friendly and kind! There team worked quickly and efficiently on the day of my wedding to do hair and make up for most of my bridal party plus my mother and my mother in law- and a surprise person who changed her mind from doing her own make up to asking for it done! We even got little personalized touch up kits to reapply any lipstick or pin up any additional hair. I highly highly recommend this team of amazing professionals. I never leave review s for anything but they all should be recognized for their dedicated work. Thank you forever to this team, specifically Josiah and Paige who helped me look and feel so beautiful on my special day.

•Gianna P.•Oct 15, 2024

Awaken Beauty: Luxury Makeup & Hair Services was an absolute dream to work with for my wedding day. From their responsive, attentive, and knowledgeable communication style, to the flawless, beautiful, and creative quality of their work, this team exceeded all of my expectations. The makeup artist Josiah made me feel like a total queen, and ended up saving the day by playing a huge role in making my wedding vision a reality. As a makeup artist myself, I'm very picky about my look, but Josiah listened closely to my preferences and delivered a stunning, customized look that made me feel confident and comfortable. I wish he could have attended my whole wedding! I would 10000% recommend Awaken Beauty to any couple looking for a luxury beauty team that will go above and beyond.
