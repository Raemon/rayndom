Weddings with Athena 5.0

Hi, I’m Athena! As a wedding planner and event coordinator based in Northern CA, I specialize in creating seamless and memorable celebrations. With years of experience in the industry and a background in design consulting, I focus on bringing my clients’ unique visions to life while ensuring a stress-free planning experience. Whether you're dreaming of an intimate gathering or a grand affair, I’m here to guide you every step of the way—from vendor coordination to timeline creation and all the little details in between. My goal is to make the planning process enjoyable and to craft an event that truly reflects you.“My sister hired Athena to plan and coordinate her wedding, and our family absolutely loved her! From the very beginning, Athena provided constant support and guidance. Without her, my sister's day would have been chaotic—especially since it was a backyard wedding with limited vendors. Athena made sure everything ran smoothly, from keeping all the helpers on track to ensuring that all our guests were happy. She truly took care of the entire family, allowing us to enjoy the day without worrying about the details. Thanks, Athena, for bringing my sister and now brother’s wedding day to life!”Jacob M., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/c3da810a-ff7b-4412-9faa-11b781b77f9d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/weddings-with-athena)

I am extremely type A and organized and I couldn't believe how much I didn't think about. The questions she asks, the moments and details she thinks about that I hadn't even considered. The planing program she has is AMAZING for seating charts, keeping track of budgeting. I loved how task oriented she is; after each of our meetings I would walk away with a checklist and timeline so I knew what and when I needed things done, and I would just send it her way and she would work her magic. She is so organized, on top of it, creative, responsive, and fun!! I literally didn't have to worry about anything the day of. I even learned after the fact that there was some guest drama with this seating chart and she and my sister handled it and I didn't even know about it!! Truly worth every single cent. I would prioritize Love With in the Details in your wedding budgeting because it is TRULY WORTH IT!!

They made me so happy because they were absolutely perfect, and I credit that entirely to Amanda’s dedication and collaboration with Emporio, the preferred floral vendor at Hard Rock Los Cabos. Florals were the wedding detail I cared about the most, and they also caused me the most worry. They hold such a special place in my heart because I believe they truly accentuate the beauty of a wedding. From the moment Amanda stepped in, she eased all my anxieties. She was dedicated, focused, and meticulous in her attention to detail. She was assertive in communicating my needs to the vendor, efficient in coordinating every step, proactive in addressing potential challenges, and direct in making sure my vision was honored exactly as I imagined. Her strong and trusted relationship with Emporio made all the difference. They clearly respect and value her, which ensured flawless execution and also saved me thousands of dollars. That kind of value comes from her experience, credibility, and deep commitment to her clients. Because of Amanda, my my most treasured design element was in the very best hands. If you have the opportunity to work with her, I recommend it wholeheartedly. She is worth every penny and more.”Anastasia L., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/4d1f1f9a-16a4-4225-b0fc-e7b88ac1c1cf?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/amanda-antonetti-events)

The last three months leading up to my wedding were incredibly stressful, but bringing Cynthia on board as our day-of coordinator was one of the best decisions we made. From the moment she stepped in, she brought a sense of calm and control that truly helped relieve so much of the pressure I was feeling. Cynthia is incredibly organized and detail-oriented. She thought of things I never would have, and her preparation gave me the confidence to actually enjoy my wedding day. She executed all the decor exactly how I envisioned it and added thoughtful touches that made everything look even more beautiful than I imagined. When unexpected things came up (as they always do!), Cynthia handled them with grace and quick thinking, adjusting both the timeline and details seamlessly without ever needing to stress me out. She also managed all communication with the other vendors on the big day, which was a huge load off my shoulders. I didn’t have to worry about a single logistical detail because I knew she had it covered. My family couldn’t stop raving about how wonderful and helpful she was throughout the entire day.

After years of being the go-to planner in my personal and professional circles, I’m officially launching a new adventure: full service wedding planning and month/day-of wedding coordination! Whether you’re a DIY couple who needs a little backup or you want someone to take the reins on the day-of, I’m here to make it all happen without a hitch. 📍 Serving the San Francisco Bay Area Let’s make some wedding day magic together!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We were so happy with the service provided by Krysta at Happens Like Magic, our wedding coordinator. From the very beginning, I said my part in the planning was done & I was handing it off to her. I wanted to just enjoy and take in all of the moments of my wedding & not be bothered by the details or hiccups. Her communication style was attentive, prompt, and she was easy to communicate with. I only had to explain things once & she took it from there. She was always quick to respond to our questions and keep us updated on the planning process. On the day of the wedding, Krysta’s detail-oriented approach was evident. Any issues that arose were handled completely by the Krysta before I even found out. She was always there, so I never had to go searching for her. Her commitment to ensuring our special day went off without a hitch was greatly appreciated, and we are so glad we didn’t try to do this without her. We highly recommend Happens Like Magic to any couple planning their wedding.”Jessica H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/e0f05804-d147-424c-88de-523aa36d3db6?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/happens-like-magic)

AWE Planner 5.0

  * Offers 5 services

  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

As the founder of AWE Planner, you might wonder: How did she become a planner? How many events do we coordinate each year? What inspires us about this work? For founder Jenn Greel, becoming a wedding and event planner was a natural path. Her journey began with bartending private events, and planning gatherings for friends, which eventually spared the idea of launching her own planning business. From our first wedding fair to signing our first client-who happened to be a coworker at the time-AWE Planner was built from scratch. With every event we've learned, grown, and harnessed our experiences to shape the outstanding team we are today.“My wife and I got married a few months ago and we hired Jenn from Awe Planner for our ceremony. It was at the Palace of Fine Arts in SF. Jenn was super communicative during the planning phase and extremely detail oriented. She came to the rehearsal and was able to see our vision and make sure everyone was on board. She was GREAT with the kids too which was helpful! Wedding day, Jenn was absolutely ON IT and super incredible! She was very professional and knew exactly what to do even when a few things went wrong…. She quickly pivoted and still able to execute flawlessly. I never packed at any point as I knew Jenn had everything under control at all times. Her energy is great- positive and high but not overwhelming at all… literally Perfect! We had several people compliment us on how well she did which is when you know that u hired the right team! Jenn truly made our wedding ceremony run perfectly and we would 200% recommend her and hire her again if we needed! 10/10 hire her! Thank you again, Jenn!!!!”Diana H., a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/bbb6c400-d6be-4004-a3b9-806c032a3fa2?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/awe-planner)

I take pride in what I do and ensure that everyone from my Bride and Groom or Host, their guests, and even their hired vendors are taken care of throughout the celebration.“Coco-Creations was an absolute lifesaver for our wedding. Elizabeth was incredibly detail-oriented, thorough, and patient as she guided us through the final stages of planning. She ensured we accounted for all the little details we hadn’t even considered. On the days of the wedding, we were able to fully immerse ourselves in the celebration without a single worry about behind-the-scenes logistics. Elizabeth’s meticulous attention to every aspect, from the big picture to the smallest detail, allowed us to truly enjoy every moment.

We are Anna and Lucky, the passionate founders of The Darling Buds , a women-owned, event planning company that's all about turning your special moments into unforgettable memories! At The Darling Buds, we are committed to delivering a service rooted in trust, care, and attention to detail. We understand how meaningful your special moments are, and we treat each one with the respect and dedication it deserves. Your happiness is at the heart of everything we do. Let’s work together to create lasting memories, thoughtfully crafted and beautifully remembered.“We couldn't have asked for better wedding planners than Anna and Lucky! They are incredibly responsible, detail-oriented, and an absolute joy to work with. From the very beginning, they scheduled an initial meeting to understand our love story, our vision for the wedding, our budget, and to walk us through the services they offer at The Darling Buds. After that meeting, they sent over a detailed breakdown of their packages. After thoughtful consideration, we chose the Month-of Coordination package--and it was one of the best decisions we made! In addition to coordination, they helped us build a beautiful and affordable wedding website that included our love story, the wedding agenda, RSVP page, photo gallery, and a link to our registry. They also went above and beyond by helping us create a wedding invitation tailored for our international guests to assist with their visa applications--such a thoughtful touch. One month before the wedding, we had a comprehensive prep meeting to go through every detail of the big day. Anna and Lucky became our main point of contact for all vendor communication, which saved us so much time and stress. As first-time newlyweds, we felt incredibly supported--they thought of every little detail we might have missed. They were punctual and helpful at our rehearsal, offering invaluable tips for ceremony positioning, like where each person should stand and how to coordinate with photographers and videographers to ensure all the right moments were captured. On the wedding day itself, Anna and Lucky truly worked their magic-arranging outdoor dining tables, communicating seamlessly with vendors, and keeping us updated on the schedule to make sure everything went smoothly. We are beyond satisfied with the planning and execution of our wedding thanks to Anna and Lucky. My husband and I had a truly magical day, and we wholeheartedly recommend their services to anyone who is going to plan their wedding!”Joy B., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/faa7cbd0-5119-445a-bc46-73f1b36e87a6?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/the-darling-buds-event-design-planning)

As your partner in the planning process, I'll help uncover goals and priorities, providing timelines and to-do lists that work without the overwhelm. I work closely with vendors and communicate the expectations for the wedding day so everyone is on the same page and can execute a seamless experience for couples and their guests.“We had the most wonderful experience working with Samantha Gruwell for our Nov 2021 Deer Park Villa wedding. She did the month of coordination and it was the best decision we could have made. We were feeling overwhelmed with all of the details that still needed ironed out those last few weeks leading up the wedding, and Sam was so helpful in getting everything organized, and really put us at ease. She took control of communication with all our vendors (venue, photographer, caterer, DJ, florist) and ensured our special day had a well planned schedule that ran seamlessly. Sam was so hands-on throughout the entire process. We did multiple zoom calls to go over details and questions, and she did a walk through of the venue with us a few weeks prior. She helped us organize our rehearsal to ensure the ceremony had the right timing and flow. And she helped us perfectly execute it on the day of. She even stuck around through the very end of the evening and helped to dismantle some of the flowers and decor. Sam really put her heart and soul into ensuring our wedding day went flawlessly, and she’s also one of the kindest, most thoughtful people you’ll meet. Our wedding was an absolute dream, and we owe it all to Sam for making our dream a reality!

I was born and raised in a beautiful valley in Western Colorado. I prefer living in small towns, but I like visiting big cities and finding all the best restaurants. Even though I spent most of my life in the west, I am enjoying the opportunity of living in new places. Along with event planning, a few other things that I love are my husband, my daughters, dogs (but especially my own), mountains, home improvement projects, camping, thunderstorms, dance parties, any and all dessert, cooking, and wearing the color black.“Kel Bozeman Events was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. From the start, Mikelle demonstrated active listening, respect, and responsiveness, ensuring our vision was brought to life. Her work was commendable, proficient, detailed, and outstanding - she made sure everything went according to plan and timeline, paid close attention to every detail, and handled any stressful situations with excellent communication and calm professionalism.

2 Friends Events was established in 2010 by...2 Friends! Lindsey and I met as co-maids of honor in our friend Wendi's wedding. We loved working together, so we decided to take a chance and start our own event planning company. Lindsay has since retired to be with her family and I now run 2 Friends Events with the help of my amazing team.“There is no question that choosing 2 Friends Events as our wedding planner was the best decision we made throughout the process. (And of course, we made a lot of other smart and delightful decisions thanks to the 2FE team!) From our first call through the week after our wedding, Nichole and her team provided us constant support, seamless logistics and research, and brought so much joy to the planning process. As our planner, Nichole listened, helped keep us focused on what we said was important to us, and was always five steps ahead with her proactivity and organization. And my goodness, did she bring our vision to life! Everything from it being colorful and vibrant to finding an ADA friendly venue to incorporating our dog and favorite beverage Spindrift to herding us all on the wedding day (no strong feat!). Last but not least, each person we interacted with was just kind and a good human being. When we had a family crisis the weeks leading up to the wedding, she immediately helped pull together contingency plans. We couldn’t have been more grateful for everything they did for us. Thank you, Nichole and team! Trust us, you won’t regret choosing 2 Friends Events.”Marie and D., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/2-friends-events)
