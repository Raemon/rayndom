Hi there! I’m Trivia, the owner of a beautiful venue, wedding planner, and florist. As a true lover at heart, there’s nothing I adore more than seeing couples in love and helping them bring their dream weddings to life. The wedding industry is where my heart thrives, and I’m honored to be part of such a special moment. From the big picture to the tiniest details, I’m here to make sure your day is nothing short of magical. It’s pure joy for me to witness the happiness and love as it all unfolds—I can't wait to be part of your love story! 💖

What sets me apart from other planners is that I truly listen to my couples. I take the time to understand their needs, dreams, and vision, ensuring every detail reflects their love story. I’m sensitive to the emotions that come with planning a wedding and always follow up to make sure everything feels right. For me, it’s not just about the couple—it’s about bringing families together and celebrating the unity they’re creating. I’m here to make sure that every moment feels as special as the love that brought you all together! 💕

  * ### Best day of my life

•Verified review

•Luis•Jun 30, 2025

My wife Sandra and I got married on March 15, 2025, at the San Diego Marriott Hotel, and we had the absolute pleasure of working with Trivia and her team at Venue To Go. From the moment we connected, Trivia was professional, responsive, and incredibly attentive to every detail. The wedding arrangements were beyond beautiful—everything from the florals to the overall design felt personal and perfectly tailored to our vision. What really stood out was Trivia’s follow-through. She checked in with us consistently and made sure every detail was handled with care. Her attention to the timeline was impeccable, which helped the entire day run smoothly and stress-free. We couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out. If you’re planning a wedding and want someone who truly cares, is organized, and has amazing taste—I highly recommend Trivia and Venue To Go. They made our day unforgettable.

Our wedding in March 2024 was an absolute dream, all thanks to Venue To Go and the incredible Trivia Flowers! From start to finish, they provided full-service planning, floral design, and coordination, making our big day completely stress-free and absolutely incredible. Trivia's attention to detail, creativity, and professionalism exceeded our expectations in every way. The floral arrangements were amazing, and the entire event ran smoothly because of her expert coordination. My wife and I couldn’t be happier with their services and highly recommend Venue To Go for anyone looking for a seamless, beautifully executed wedding!
