  * ### Wedding of our Dreams

•Verified review

•Alcelie S.•Nov 19, 2025

San Clemente Shores by Wedgewood Weddings exceeded our expectations. The reason why we booked our wedding venue through them is because of their package deals. We love how it relieves the stress having to book multiple vendors. The WW staff were so accommodating, friendly, professional, and had great attention to detail. The wedding coordinators are exceptional, going above and beyond to make our wedding day spectacular. Our guests were impressed with their professionalism, accommodating to our guests. We appreciate that their services did not stop with us, but to our guests. The staff who manned our ceremony and reception were absolutely amazing. Showed great kindness and respect to everyone. Our bartender Taylor was amazing making sure we kept hydrated. I love how she provided me a different cocktail every time. She’s a genius behind the bar. Our officiant, Pastor Stan Doll, was so personable and ran our ceremony smoothly. I love how he made everything flow seamlessly and had great timing in throwing humor in to lighten the mood. Our DJ, Rachel K, is the most amazing person who uplifted the mood and was accommodating to our guests’ requests throughout the night. I love the way she transitioned each song, so that they blend well together. She really is a master in her craft. I can’t say enough great things about Wedgewood Weddings. They made our wedding a surreal experience not only for us, but our guests.

  * ### Amazing experience!

•Verified review

•Brianna•Oct 7, 2025

What a great venue and staff! As an out-of-state couple, this team truly made the planning simple - vendors came included where we needed and they provided flexibility to swap out where we wanted. The team made our vision come to life, and their service was unmatched. Cannot thank this team enough, and would be excited to recommend them anytime.

  * ### Amazing Experience

•Verified review

•Lauren E.•Aug 11, 2025

Biggest shoutout to the entire amazing staff at Wedgewood San Clemente! The “Ladies of Wedgewood” (as I lovingly refer to them)—Sierra H., Noelle, Taylor, Sierra D., and Kristine—truly went above and beyond to make our entire wedding experience unforgettable. They were incredibly helpful, professional, and accommodating from start to finish. Always quick to respond, they took time to ensure every one of our needs was met, no matter how big or small. They patiently answered our trillion questions and guided us with helpful suggestions and reassuring support that made wedding planning feel so much easier. A special shoutout to Taylor, who even went out on the day of our wedding to get us a guest book when ours didn’t arrive in time—talk about dedication! All of Wedgewood’s recommended vendors were excellent, too. We worked with True Photography, Oceanic Flowers, It’s All About the Cake, and DJ Maestro—and they were all fantastic. Huge thanks to our DJ/MC Rachel for absolutely crushing it! She was so fun, energetic, and professional. She worked closely with us before the big day to perfect our playlist and even coordinated seamlessly with our string quartet to make the ceremony magical. The day-of staff was just as amazing! • Taylor (bartender) was the sweetest—she made sure my husband and I always had a drink in hand and even crafted a custom specialty drink based on my tastes. She was a total rockstar behind the bar. • Jonah (banquet captain) made sure all our items were packed up and got home with us safely. And made sure we were well taken care of all night. • And our servers— Bri, Luke, Caitlyn, and Adrianna—were all so attentive and kind to our guests. Words truly can’t express how pleased and grateful we are for our entire experience. Wedgewood San Clemente made our dream wedding a reality, and we’ll never forget it. I’d recommend them 1,000 times over!

•Verified review

•Savannah•Jun 11, 2025

From the very beginning, the communication with San Clemente Shore by Wedgewood Weddings was absolutely outstanding. Every email, text, and phone call was answered promptly, and the smaller sales team ensured I was always speaking to familiar faces who knew exactly who I was. One of the best parts of working with Wedgewood was not having to outsource our own vendors. From the start, they provided a curated selection of high-quality, trusted vendors that made the planning process so much easier and stress-free. It was such a relief to know we were in good hands with their recommendations. Sierra, our day-of coordinator, was a dream to work with. From the first day we toured the venue, she built a wonderful rapport with us and went above and beyond throughout the entire process. From booking to the rehearsal and the wedding day itself, Sierra’s meticulous attention to detail and seamless execution made everything stress-free. As a bride, knowing I could trust her completely with our timeline was such a relief. DJ Rachel brought unmatched energy to our reception and was an absolute hit with our younger crowd. She curated the perfect vibe, hyping up every song I wanted and keeping the dance floor alive all night. Jonah, our banquet captain, was equally amazing. He consistently checked in with us throughout the day to make sure we were well taken care of. He even went the extra mile by packing us one of everything from our buffet to take home, which was such a thoughtful and unexpected gesture. San Clemente Shore by Wedgewood Weddings truly exceeded all expectations, and I couldn’t recommend them enough for creating a flawless and unforgettable wedding day.
