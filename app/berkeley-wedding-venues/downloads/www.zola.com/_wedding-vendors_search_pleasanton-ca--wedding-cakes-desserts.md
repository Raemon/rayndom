Two Chicks In The Mix

  * Starts at $5 per serving
  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

The summer of 2013, Malaka approached her bestie since high school, Erica, with a crazy idea: let's start a business! Our love for pastries and food led us into the kitchen and from then on we were Two Chicks in the Mix. It was that very summer where we test baked items like our Lavender Cake and Mixed Berry Pie, which are staples on our menu today. With roots in South LA, we intend to bring a new approach to bakeries in our community. From sourcing California-made, organic ingredients to making everything from scratch, we aim to create an experience that feels and tastes thoughtfully and lovingly made.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/two-chicks-in-the-mix)

BÁNH BAKERY 5.0

  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

BÁNH BAKERY is a cookie-focused bakery, offering small-batch cookies inspired by nostalgic Asian flavors alongside beloved American classics. While “bánh” translates to “cake” in Vietnamese, it’s also a broad term used for many foods—from dumplings and pastries to sticky rice treats and baguettes. We chose the name for its openness and versatility, even though our offerings are exclusively cookies. Rooted in tradition and shaped by our experiences, we bake to honor family, build community, and create second chances—one thoughtfully crafted cookie at a time![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Banh Bakery brought their cookies to our dealership’s Cars & Coffee event, and they were a total hit. The texture is soft enough to melt in your mouth, and the balance of sweetness is spot-on, while being rich without being overwhelming. I could have eaten five in a row and still wanted more. The Banana Walnut Chocolate Chip Cookie is the star. It’s comforting, elevated, and truly a crowd favorite, which is something guests of all ages will rave about long after the reception. What also stands out is the packaging. It’s polished and elegant, with clear ingredient labeling, making it ideal for gifting or as a memorable wedding favor. Even at 5 a cookie, they’re absolutely worth it for the quality and presentation. Cheryl and Charlie responded quickly to my request, and it was easy to plan out exactly what we needed for our event based on their recommendations. When dealing with a diverse crowd, you want treats that accommodate all palates. In this case, we literally ran out of cookies before the event ended! I don’t usually splurge on cookies, but I bought a separate box to send to my aunt on the East Coast just so she could experience them, too. That’s how good the cookies are! If you want a unique and unforgettable treat for your big day, Banh Bakery delivers.”Ryan B., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/b9ada438-45c7-472e-958d-095f03519467?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/banh-bakery)

We had a general idea of the dessert bar we wanted for our wedding. We gave Tiffany our dessert requests and she made delicious treats for our 250 guests. She made mini apple pies (they had to have the crumble top as this is my husband’s favorite), blackbottom cupcakes (who doesn’t love chocolate?) sweet potato tarts (You have to try her sweet potato tarts- we order them every Thanksgiving!) and allergy free Rice Krispies (amazing!). All the desserts arrived on time, in perfect condition, and she displayed them for us in a picture perfect way. Our guests were happy to have a variety of desserts that all tasted really good. Tiffany is great to work with. She is easy to talk to, patient with us when we were indecisive, and helped make our wedding a memorable event. We have continued to order from MiGoodies for other occasions- our baby shower cake (try the cookies and cream cake- this is another one of my favorites!) holiday pies, and most recently for cookie dough. Tiffany is professional, kind and a pleasure to work with.

I can't say the same about the rest of food we had for our wedding, so I am glad we went with her for the most important part. From the moment we reached out, she was incredibly responsive, helpful and on top of every detail. She listened to my fiancée's (now wife!) desire for an actually TASTY cake with really unique buttercream flowers. I'd never seen such pretty designs on a cake before, but this is my first wedding, so maybe everyone has them these days? Elena even drew a detailed sketch to show us exactly what the final cake would look like. It was a HUGE hit with our guests. Everyone raved about the lemon flavor. It tasted like I imagine a Sicilian lemon tasting without ever having been to Siciliy. The cake and desserts (we had tiramisu cups too!) from Secret Kitchen SF were the standout of the evening, almost eclipsing this modest groom.

As a destination bride, the thought of selecting a baker without in-person tastings or detailed discussions was daunting, but Sammycakes immediately put our fears at ease. She perfectly captured our vision, creating the most beautiful wedding cake and groom's cake imaginable. Beyond just being stunning, both cakes were incredibly delicious! We received so many compliments from our guests, with many saying it was some of the best cake they've ever had. The communication throughout the process was easy and clear, making what could have been a stressful experience into a smooth and enjoyable one. We're so glad we trusted Sammycakes with our special day. If you're looking for a baker who delivers on both artistry and taste, look no further!”Kayla M., 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/128dd59a-49ab-453c-b7c5-295828d3767c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/sammycakes)

From the very first consultation, they made the process feel easy and exciting. They were incredibly communicative, always quick to answer my questions, and genuinely receptive to feedback. I never once felt like just another client—they treated me with care and attention, which gave me so much confidence leading up to the big day. The cake tasting was one of the highlights of wedding planning. Every flavor was delicious, but the almond cake with apricot filling completely stole the show—it was honestly the most incredible cake flavor I’ve ever tried. Palette Cakes made the experience fun and memorable, and it felt like they were just as invested in finding the perfect flavor combination as I was. On the wedding day, the cake was everything I had dreamed of and more. It was stunningly beautiful, decorated with intricate sugar flowers that perfectly complemented our florist’s arrangements. Guests couldn’t stop admiring it, and when we finally cut into it, the taste was just as divine as we remembered from the tasting. It was one of those rare moments where something looks too good to eat, but then tastes even better than it looks. What impressed me most was how Palette Cakes worked closely with me to ensure the cake fit within our budget without ever compromising on quality or artistry. They truly went above and beyond, and the final product exceeded every expectation I had. Their professionalism, creativity, and genuine care made the entire process seamless and joyful. I would wholeheartedly recommend them to any couple planning their wedding—you’ll not only get a cake that’s beautiful and delicious, but you’ll also gain a partner who makes you feel supported every step of the way.”Victoria D., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/8f6cca7d-c841-41d9-9cf6-efaafbb5efb6?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/palette-cakes)

We take pride in our continuous exploration and refinement of flavors, with valuable input from our wonderful community. Your support has been instrumental in our journey, and we eagerly anticipate the opportunity to serve you. Thank you for being a part of our success, and we look forward to delighting your taste buds soon!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I've enjoyed mochi donuts from other businesses but someone told me I had to try Mochata and I'm glad I took their word for it. Best mochi donuts hands down that I've had in a long time! I reached out to Erik to inquire about catering mini mochi donuts for my wedding in March 2024 and his customer service was on a whole other level. He was so personable and friendly that I just wanted to order just because of that (go small businesses go!). I asked if he had samples to try and he gladly made a batch and I ended up ordering 5 dozen mini donuts. Everyone at my wedding LOVED them. So much that I didn't even get to have any myself during reception! What stands out the most about Mochata's donuts is that the flavor is actually IN the donut itself. Not just the icing that we're all used to. And the texture? Exactly the way a mochi should taste. Flavors? ON POINT!! The toppings are very generous, especially the Cookies N Cream and Mint Oreo. My absolute favorites are Coconut Pandan, Ube and Strawberries N Cream and my husband always goes for the Mint Oreo. Now that it's post-wedding, I've been having cravings so I ordered more just for my family and I to enjoy. I haven't tried all the flavors yet but I have no doubt that they all taste delicious. I also recently got myself a Thai Horchata drink. I never thought about combining the two flavors together and it was super good! Now I feel like I need to try every flavor of that as well. Thank you Erik for being able to make my wedding day even more special! Definitely plan to be a regular customer for whenever I have a craving.”Phuong D., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/a40fa37f-e12f-4d59-89d2-34e8d98f6c84?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/mochata-mochi-donuts-horchata)
