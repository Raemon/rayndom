Five Course Provision 5.0 San Jose, CA

  * Starts at $2,750 

Chef John Alvarez, raised in the Bay Area, discovered his passion for cooking early, earning the nickname “tortilla boy” at 12 while working in his family’s restaurant. Training under Michelin-starred chefs like Michael Cimarusti, Michael Tusk, and Curtis Stone, he honed his expertise in seafood, fine dining, and butchery. Inspired by Chef Rick Bayless, John mastered modern Mexican cuisine at Leña Brava, specializing in moles, salsas, and wood-fire cooking. Today, he crafts personalized menus that celebrate diverse flavors and unforgettable dining experiences.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Planning a wedding can be a whirlwind, but partnering with Five Course Provisions and Chef John Alvarez made the catering aspect an absolute breeze. For our January 2025 wedding at the stunning Seymour Marine Center, we envisioned a customized buffet that reflected our love for both Asian and Italian cuisine. Chef Alvarez not only met, but exceeded our expectations. He crafted a truly unique and delicious menu that perfectly captured our favorite dishes, leaving our guests raving about the incredible flavors and variety. Beyond the exquisite food, the presentation was impeccable. The desserts, in particular, were a feast for the eyes and the palate – beautifully presented and utterly delicious. In fact, the food was so captivating that we were completely swept away in the moment and even forgot to take pictures! That’s a testament to how much we and our guests were enjoying the culinary experience. But what truly set Five Course Provisions apart was the five-star service. From the initial consultation to the wedding day itself, Chef Alvarez and his team were professional, attentive, and genuinely enthusiastic about making our day special. Their friendly demeanor and seamless execution allowed us to relax and fully enjoy our celebration. We wholeheartedly recommend Five Course Provisions to anyone seeking a truly exceptional catering experience. Chef John Alvarez's culinary artistry and unwavering dedication to service made our wedding day unforgettable. Thank you for creating such a memorable dining experience!”Bride of t., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/233b4c8a-3e81-49de-b933-282287619eeb?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/five-course-provision)

Kitchenina 5.0

  * Starts at $2,000 
  * Serves San Jose, CA

The best three words to describe our work and us are quality, consistency and passion. Our company name is a hybrid of the words "Kitchen" in English and "Kouzina" in Greek. We are Greek, so hospitality and food is in our blood! I (Aliki) have been in the Food and Beverage Industry since I was 14 years old. I started as a waitress and went all the way up to a Food and Beverage Manager for big Hotel chains before starting my own company. We live to make people happy and we go above and beyond for our couples. The best part is that we are family-owned and our home-cooked meals are all made with love.“We used Kitchenina for our wedding in October and I will never be able to say enough good things about the entire experience from start to finish. They were super responsive and helped us think about things we hadn’t thought about. The food was delicious, I still have people talking about how good the food was when we talk about the wedding. The whole team was amazing, they were incredibly attentive to all the guests on day of wedding and Aliki was so helpful throughout the whole process. I would recommend them to anyone planning an event, we are so thankful we had them as part of our team on our special day.”Cora C., a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/d72c61da-f0ce-4cc3-bf80-9171893d754b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/kitchenina)

On The Roll Catering 5.0

  * Serves San Jose, CA

Fascinated with the art and science of food, Masha (our owner and Chef de Cuisine) has been learning and practicing variety of recipes and cooking techniques since her early teenage years. Years later, as a Summa Cum Laude graduate from prestigious Sankt Petersburg SWISSAM Academy of Culinary Arts, Masha continues to pursue her true passion - sharing her love for cooking through delicious, heart and soul warming food.“On The Roll Catering exceeded our expectations for our wedding! Masha, Lena, and Georgyi (bar) were fantastic to work with, accommodating all of our special requests and last-minute changes with ease. The food was truly phenomenal, featuring delicious options like steak, fish, blini with caviar, etc and our guests loved every bite! What really impressed us was the value we received—our invoice was surprisingly reasonable given the high-quality dishes. Other vendors quoted us more for simpler menu items, yet On The Roll delivered exceptional quality without breaking the bank. The drinks were delicious, and the crew was professional and attentive. They even helped us secure rentals just a week before the wedding, which was a lifesaver! We highly recommend On The Roll Catering for any event!”Katya, a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/on-the-roll-catering)

YOOSHI SUSHI CATERING & EVENT PRODUCTION 5.0

  * Serves San Jose, CA

I had my first shot at managing a sushi restaurant when I took over an empty section of the family restaurant and introduced sushi to my customers. It was a challenge that I will never regret accepting. It was fun, a lot of fun! I had the opportunity to work with some really talented and creative chefs. I quickly learned that it’s not just about having fresh fish anymore. Sushi dining has transformed into a culture. A culture built by imagination and creativity. With the help of GD and the support of my family, I took all that experience and fused it with my imagination and created Yooshi Sushi Catering and Event Production.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Great to order from really good value too.

From our initial inquiry, the team was responsive, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure our day was perfect. Jolene, our event coordinator, was a true superstar - she made sure everything ran smoothly and even helped us out when it unexpectedly rained by quickly setting up pop-up tents to keep our guests dry. The food was exceptional, beautifully presented, and received rave reviews from all our guests. AnyThyme's hardworking team truly made our wedding day stress-free and unforgettable. We can't recommend them highly enough!”Zoey R., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/cc5bbfba-9805-4da2-8fef-a30a93026ad7?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/anythyme-catering)

We strive to bring you the essence of the Spanish dining experience, taking care of the details to ensure the event is as seamless and stress-free as possible. Ñora can handle everything from menu planning (including vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options), event coordination, rentals, decorations, staffing and more! Our team of experts can help make any vision into a reality. Whether it’s a spectacular wedding of 200 guests or an intimate gathering for 20, no event is too large or small.“My husband and I are from different cultures. We have relatives who think paprika is spicy and friends who love more flavor. We wanted food that would be a crowd-pleaser for all our guests. We were also on a strict budget. Every other caterer wanted to charge way more for food that didn't sound all that exciting. I was so happy when I found Nora. We went with three paellas, tapas, and a grazing board. The paellas were a big hit, and everyone got to have a delicious meal. It was also a cool experience for our guests to see the paellas being cooked. Alexa, Emily, and the staff were great, but they are quite busy, so communication can be slow. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend Nora for your event. I knocked down a star because their communication skills aren't the best, but they were flexible on all our menu requests and were very accommodating to our last-minute timeline.”Happy B., 10 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/nora-spanish-cuisine)
