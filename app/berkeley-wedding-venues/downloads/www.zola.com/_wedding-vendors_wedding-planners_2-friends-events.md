2 Friends Events was established in 2010 by...2 Friends! Lindsey and I met as co-maids of honor in our friend Wendi's wedding. We loved working together, so we decided to take a chance and start our own event planning company. Lindsay has since retired to be with her family and I now run 2 Friends Events with the help of my amazing team.

Our motto today is the same as it was when we first started, make event planning fun! We love working with couples that have one, very simple goal...plan a day where they can celebrate their love with family and friends.

**In three words:** Calm, Flexible, Fun

  * ### The best wedding decision you’ll make!

•Verified review

•Marie and D.•Aug 4, 2023

There is no question that choosing 2 Friends Events as our wedding planner was the best decision we made throughout the process. (And of course, we made a lot of other smart and delightful decisions thanks to the 2FE team!) From our first call through the week after our wedding, Nichole and her team provided us constant support, seamless logistics and research, and brought so much joy to the planning process. As our planner, Nichole listened, helped keep us focused on what we said was important to us, and was always five steps ahead with her proactivity and organization. And my goodness, did she bring our vision to life! Everything from it being colorful and vibrant to finding an ADA friendly venue to incorporating our dog and favorite beverage Spindrift to herding us all on the wedding day (no strong feat!). Last but not least, each person we interacted with was just kind and a good human being. When we had a family crisis the weeks leading up to the wedding, she immediately helped pull together contingency plans. We couldn’t have been more grateful for everything they did for us. Thank you, Nichole and team! Trust us, you won’t regret choosing 2 Friends Events.
