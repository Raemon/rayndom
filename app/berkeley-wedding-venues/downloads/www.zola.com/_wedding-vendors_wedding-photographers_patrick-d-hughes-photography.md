As a passionate wedding photographer based in Oakland, I capture the raw emotions and cherished moments of your special day, crafting timeless images that tell your unique love story. With a keen eye for detail and a natural ability to capture candid moments, I strive to create a relaxed and enjoyable experience for you and your loved ones, ensuring your wedding photos are as unforgettable as the day itself.

I make friends everywhere I go. Perhaps it was my upbringing or my travel adventures that helped form me into a person who gets along with all walks of life. I think it's important to help the people I photograph to feel at ease and it shows in the photos. With over 20 years experience photographing weddings, I have the unique blend of friendliness and know how to create lovely images. I'd describe my work as a mix of editorial and candid photos with a dash of contemporary. I think that's what most people want. A little classic with a mix of new ideas.

  * ### Great photographer!

•Verified review

•Jasmine•Feb 2, 2025

It was a pleasure to work with Patrick. We had our wedding at the Berkeley City Club. I told him our specific needs and he was willing to make it work for us. He really captured our special day for us. Nice mix of candid moments and posed family photos.

  * ### Amazing photographer!!

•Verified review

•bri•Jan 29, 2025

Patrick was incredible! We had our wedding in July at Hakone Gardens in Saratoga. Patrick worked with us to find the best locations to photograph at. He made sure to get everything on our shot list, and had some unique ideas of his own to add. He went above and beyond for us! He was friendly, professional, and easy to work with. We cannot recommend Patrick highly enough!
