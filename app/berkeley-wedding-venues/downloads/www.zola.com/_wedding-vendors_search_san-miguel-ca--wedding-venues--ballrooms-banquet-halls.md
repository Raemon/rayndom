![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“If you’re looking for a wedding that you will remember forever, I highly recommend booking with Carmel Fields by Wedgewood. The reception space was absolutely amazing—spacious, stylish, and perfect for a celebration. The staff made sure we felt comfortable and promptly addressed any issues or questions we had. My wife and I want to give a special shoutout to our main coordinator Alycia! She was truly amazing and it was a perfect day thanks to her. With her attention to detail and sharing our vision. We also want to thank Anahi and Angie and everyone who made our special day truly magical. They were incredibly friendly, well-coordinated, and organized. They ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing us to enjoy the night without a single worry. This made the day feel stress-free for everyone and allowed us to relax and watch all our family and friends enjoy the wedding—whether it was on the dance floor or at the bar enjoying drinks! There are so many great things we could say about this place, but I’ll simply let the reviews speak for themselves! My wife and I had an excellent experience. The rooms, including the bridal suite and groom’s suite, were beautifully set up, the food was delicious, the bar had amazing drinks and their vendors made the planning process effortless. We truly appreciated how the coordinators and vendors made everything so easy and stress-free. We are so glad that we chose a Wedgewood location! It was such a wonderful day, and we couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out.

“We had the absolute best experience with Fairview Laguna Seca! From the very beginning, Danielle was the reason we fell in love with the venue, her energy, warmth, and attention to detail made us feel so confident in our decision. When she transitioned out of her role, we were a little anxious, but then Melissa came in and completely blew us away. Melissa worked with us through the last 6 months of planning and was nothing short of incredible. She listened to every idea, every concern, and somehow made everything happen exactly how we envisioned it. She always made us feel heard, never overwhelmed, and her calm, organized energy was everything we needed. On the day of the wedding, she was a total rockstar. She kept everything running smoothly and still managed to check in with us, make us laugh, and reassure us that everything was under control. We honestly don't know what we would’ve done without her! Amber joined the team just days before the wedding, but you’d never know it. She was so on top of things and jumped right in like she had been with us the whole time. Matt was also amazing, he made sure the day flowed perfectly and kept everything on schedule without ever making us feel rushed. The food was delicious and there was so much of it, our guests are still talking about it! The bartending team was fast, friendly, and so easy to work with. Everyone from the Fairview Laguna Seca team went above and beyond to make our day feel special and stress-free. Our DJ, Ernesto, did an incredible job! He stuck to the vibe we wanted, played every request we had, and kept the dance floor going all night long. And the FLORALS … wow. D'Lily's absolutely nailed it. Every arrangement was stunning, fresh, and picture-perfect. They truly brought our vision to life. We can’t thank the entire Fairview Laguna Seca team enough. Our wedding was a dream, and it's all because of the amazing people who made it happen!”Andrea& Nayeli D., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/5ac1b9a7-b06b-4e82-b0f3-4c1a7d71aa58?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fairview-laguna-seca)

“The Clubhouse at Boundary Oak was an absolute dream venue for our wedding! From the moment we walked through the doors, Angelique and her team made us feel welcomed and valued. Their communication was quick and responsive, always making sure we had the information we needed. The venue itself was clean, welcoming, and simply beautiful - the perfect backdrop for our special day. On the day of the wedding, Angelique went above and beyond, checking in on me and ensuring my guests felt right at home.

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“My husband and I were engaged in October 2023 and began looking at wedding venues the month after. We then finalized our booking with Redwood Canyon in January 2024 to give ourselves ample time for planning and financing for our big day on May 26th, 2025. Since we live on the East Coast and majority of our families reside in the Bay Area, we wanted to find a venue that could provide an all-inclusive package and bring our vision to reality - and Redwood Canyon checked all of those boxes... even going above and beyond. We are very happy with the entire process that led up to our special day and the outcome of our wedding. *1 year prior to the wedding* They kept us updated with some of the renovations they were making at the time. When we wanted to do a physical tour in June 2024, they fitted us into the schedule and showed us the actual colors of table cloths, napkins, lighting, etc. *8 months prior to the wedding* The wedding team sent us an invitation to the Fall Wedding Extravaganza Fair for late October 2024. We unfortunately couldn't make it, but they accommodated us by including our friend couple residing in the Bay Area to take over our place. Our friend couple FaceTimed us during the entire event to make us feel like we were there! They commented how it was nice to try out all the food options they had in the package to know what foods the couple would like to finalize for their wedding day. They also enjoyed the fun activities the DJ curated - there were two opportunities to win a prize from those activities. *5 months prior to the wedding* This was a two-hour call with the wedding team to go over our vision and details. I forgot the name of the person assisting us, but she was very patient and fun to talk with! She reassured us that if there were changes we'd like to make over the next few months, they'd be happy to accommodate. A few months later, vendors contacted us to further discuss additional details - officiant, cake, DJ, and florist. *1 week prior to the wedding* We had Jacoby as our amazing wedding coordinator and Ana to assist on our special day. They reviewed and confirmed details as well as what to expect on our Rehearsal Day, which was a day prior to our wedding. We loved their positive attitudes and professionalism throughout the process! *Wedding Day* Despite how fast and chaotic it felt, we truly appreciate Jacoby and Ana for keeping us on the right pace, consistently checking in with us, and making sure we were happy and comfortable throughout the day. If there was something I, my husband, our wedding party, and family needed, they were quick to provide it. They also knew where to put our decor and took some behind-the-scenes photos to share with us after our wedding. We had our photographer, Hayden from A Perfect Impression, who suggested all the right poses, shots, angles, and places to take our photos. Our DJ, Saul, was very accommodating with a song request and some changes that we communicated through email and text - the vibe of the ceremony and reception was perfect. The food was fantastic, the photobooth provided high-quality images that we could receive through a texted link. *Overall* If we could rate it more than 5 stars, we totally would! We are truly happy that we chose Redwood Canyon for our wedding - an amazing and friendly team with a beautiful venue that accommodated 80 of our guests!”Lynda N., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/9ef28f28-6fc6-45f2-883e-be11de6a7062?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/redwood-canyon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

Built in 1902 by the renowned architect Bernard Maybeck in traditional Arts and Crafts style, it's designed to create a cozy, intimate feeling. The crowning glory of the club is the three-story Great Hall. With its vaulted ceiling, massive stone fireplace, and stained-glass windows featuring heraldic crests of the great universities of the world, it's reminiscent of many a European cathedral. Light from the floor-to-ceiling windows warms the redwood paneling and suffuses the Hall in a golden glow. Two charming smaller spaces are also available for functions. The Heyns and Seaborg rooms (named respectively after a chancellor and a distinguished University Nobel Laureate) both have French doors leading to a private outdoor area with a garden view. The Faculty Club has been serving its members and guests for over 100 years and will do everything possible to make your event successful and enjoyable.Why you'll love this venue

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“San Ramon Waters By Wedgewood Weddings was a stunning venue for our wedding, but we did experience some minor communication issues that caused a bit of stress at the start of the day. The space itself was truly breathtaking, with its amazing new upgrades and beautiful views. However, there were a few details that weren't properly communicated to us, which led to a bit of a rocky start. Although my bridal party and I had lots to deal with prior to ceremony start, these issues were not something our guests would have seen/noticed. To their credit, the Wedgewood team acknowledged their mistakes and upgraded our bar package to make up for it. Overall, the venue was beautiful and the staff did their best to ensure our day went smoothly, despite the initial hiccups. We would recommend San Ramon Waters to other couples looking for a gorgeous wedding location.”Gabriella G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/09e08c08-a991-4f46-8f27-5f0c08b2944c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/san-ramon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“We had the absolute best experience hosting our wedding here. Natasha Norman was incredible to work with through the entire planning process. She was clear on pricing, set our expectations well, was incredibly responsive, and helped coordinate the event on the day of the wedding. We asked for some extra time to set up the room and, since the room hadn't been booked the day before the event, she let us come in the day prior to get everything in order. Natasha spoke with our DJ and coordinated for his set-up, which was very helpful. The team setting up the event also did the perfect job of setting up the tables and outdoor chairs exactly as we'd asked. I changed my mind on the arch at the last minute, and they had no problem making the change. The wedding was incredible, our guests felt comfortable in their rooms and were pleased they could bring their dogs so they didn't have to hire a dog-sitter. Everyone was impressed by the view and by the fact that the sun was setting behind the sweetheart table in the Bayview Ballroom. I also want to give a shoutout to the banquet manager who made us feel at home, kindly brought us beverages as we were setting up, and took care of us throughout the stay. I’ve received at least half a dozen compliments on the qualify of the food served, and I felt the pricing was very reasonable – especially when compared to other hotels on the water nearby. I also loved that the hotel provided us a contingency plan if we needed to move our outdoor wedding to the indoors because of rain or anything else. We truly felt special and valued and would use this venue again in a heartbeat.”Lindsey M., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-doubletree-by-hilton-berkeley-marina)

“The Omni made an incredible first impression on us. It’s a beautiful & grand space, but there was something very comfortable about it at the same time. That’s mainly due to Jano Paredes, our event coordinator. He was so welcoming & genuinely passionate about creating a special event for us. We toured two other venues, Julia Morgan & Webster Hall. While these two venues are beautiful, there weren’t nearly as caring or appreciative of our business as the Omni. The Omni made the stressful planning process enjoyable (we planned it in about 3 months!) & they were understanding when we had last minute changes & requests. They were also very flexible throughout the wedding planning. They even swapped out some of the beer in their package so they could bring in brands we liked better. Amanda Maggard is amazing. She managed the accommodations for all the guests. Many of our guests also commented on how incredible the check-in was. It was rainy that weekend, so the Omni was quick to offer complimentary umbrellas. They even gave each guest a free drink voucher at the hotel bar! Amanda also made sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable in the Presidential Suite, complete with champagne, ice buckets, & several glasses for my visitors. It’s a lovely space to take getting-ready pictures. I was originally worried the grand ballroom wasn’t going to fit our vision & was torn on using the same space for the ceremony & reception (they have another room available if you’d prefer not to do this), but it was gorgeous! The spaces felt totally unique between the ceremony & the reception. The grand ballroom really provides a blank slate to create something beautiful & it can be difficult to appreciate when it’s completely empty. The mezzanine where the cocktail hour was held is beautiful & needs no additional decorations & the dim sum buffet was a huge hit. Guests loved the reception dinner menu. We went with a plated dinner selection of sea bass, chicken, or oyster mushrooms. The crab soup was delicious & by far the most popular. The passion fruit cheesecake was exceptional, but we also offered our guests a lovely Marjolaine cake slice. Later that evening, the Presidential suite where I initially got ready was transformed into our honeymoon suite. We were greeted with chocolate covered strawberries, champagne, & two custom Omni robes with our initials embroidered on them (my new initials since I was changing my name). It was so touching that it brought tears to our eyes. The Financial District was the optimal neighborhood to host our wedding. It was very safe & picturesque. We had a several family members nervous about coming to San Francisco because of the negative media coverage, but they all fell in love with the city by the end of the weekend. I know Webster Hall wouldn’t have given us the same treatment (they didn’t seem to care if they had our business or not). Julia Morgan was wonderful, but with the Omni, we just had a feeling we’d be in the best possible hands by people who genuinely cared, & we were right. Now, we love the Omni so much that we had Valentine’s Day at Monte’s two weeks after our wedding & the hotel surprised us with dessert & champagne, as well as a card signed by their staff congratulating us on our wedding. It’s a bar we now frequent because of the quality of service, food/drinks, & of course, our wonderful memories there. The Omni was the absolute best decision of our entire wedding.”Seana P., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/omni-hotel-san-francisco)

“We loved the idea of booking a reception venue that already had an incredible staff in-house. GAMH provided us with great care and kind but honest input every step of the way. The event coordinator (the fabulous Mandy!), audio, lighting, catering, servers, bar service, coat check…..was perfection because the team is their own and prideful for the space and its legendary music history. It was special to introduce so many out-of-town guests to this beautiful classic of a venue in the heart of our city and dance the night away.

“We hosted our wedding at the Presidio Officers' Club and had truly the most special, incredible day of our lives. It was clean, well-organized, with delicious food and friendly staff. Not to mention, the planning team at the Presidio, through Wedgewood Weddings, was truly best-in-class. Wedgewood prepared us so well, providing a planning binder and step-by-step instructions. They checked in with us multiple times, providing walk-throughs, and answering every question extremely promptly. We especially loved our planner and day-of coordinator, Christian, who went out of his way to make everything so seamless. Christian taught us how to do our ceremony, including little details such as hand placement, went out of his way to accommodate a creative painting engagement, and provided private time for us newlyweds. He was perfect! So grateful to this beautiful venue and our wonderful team. We will treasure our experience with Wedgewood forever.”Natasha H., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4ee55ad9-e863-4cba-a1fb-b459a421b4da?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/officers-club-at-the-presidio)

“Having our wedding at The San Francisco Theological Seminary was one of the easiest and best decisions we made when planning for our wedding! As soon as we stepped foot on the campus, we knew it was the venue we’d been looking for. Working with the staff here (big thank you to Jeremiah Jenkins!!) was low stress and straightforward. Many other venues we looked at just didn’t feel right and felt overly complicated. The grounds were beautifully rich with history and architecture and more than we could have asked for in a wedding venue.”Heather H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/bb5b98cb-d8fa-4d6a-8fec-561973d2b369?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/university-of-redlands-marin-campus)

“The pricing on here is wrong. The venue fee alone is almost 30k. Then the food and beverage minimum is 50k but if you have 150 guests you will spend more like 80k. Plus there is a service fee of at least 13k. So BEFORE photographer, footwear, videographer, band, decor etc. you’re already at around 123k.”Jane, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/stanly-ranch)

## About wedding venues in San Miguel, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
