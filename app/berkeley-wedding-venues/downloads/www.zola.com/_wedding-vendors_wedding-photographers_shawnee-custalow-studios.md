We are passionate about photographing kind-hearted people who are unapologetically themselves, and creating a safe and beautiful space in the wedding world for LGBTQ+ folx. Our favorite people to work with believe in giving back to their communities, that black lives always matter, that climate change is you know...real, and choose to embrace their own unique quirks and talents.

We are a team of badass babes that continue to fight for love and equality, and will be your personal wedding day champions. Everyone on our team identifies as queer and we've been photographing celebrations of love for 15+ years, well before many of our dearest friends and chosen family were legally allowed to wed. We believe in capturing the moments of your celebration organically. We will make you look and feel like you just walked off the pages of queer vogue, but will never put you in weird awkward poses or ask you to do anything that doesn't feel like *you*. Reach out and let's chat about your plans!

  * ### Unbelievable Queer Wedding Photographer

•Verified review

•Sasha F.•Jun 4, 2022

Shawnee was an unbelievable photographer and such a special part of our wedding weekend. From the moment we reached out to her to getting our pictures, she has been incredibly communicative, easy to work with, and deeply kind. She made us feel so at ease and taken care of at our Rehearsal Dinner and on our wedding day. She not only allowed us to be our fullest selves but also encouraged capturing us in ways that felt authentic and not stuck in expected wedding photos or gender roles. She captured our guests so beautifully too, particularly the kids who were in our wedding. Everyone's personalities shone through so wonderfully and the picture are absolutely stunning. We cannot believe how many and how incredible each and every photo is. We cannot recommend Shawnee enough!

  * ### Shawnee is a joy to work with--and an absolute pro

•Verified review

•Adiel & R.•Jan 24, 2021

When you elope in the middle of a pandemic, it matters all the more that you love your photographer--since they'll be the only other person at your wedding. :) And in short, we couldn't be happier that ours was Shawnee. She has such a gift and a love for the work she does—and it shows. We knew she was the right person from the moment we met on Zoom--she is warm and kind, asked all the right questions, and instantly put us at ease. My partner and I eloped at the end of October 2020 in DC, just before the election. It was a whirlwind moment for so many reasons, especially as a queer couple. And it mattered to us that the person who captured those treasured memories, really understood what that moment meant to us. Everyone who sees our photos marvels at how wonderful they are—and no doubt we look great, but Shawnee’s warmth and direction and stellar eye really made all the difference. Vibing with your photographer matters—we’re so grateful to have found one with such grace and as much love for her art as Shawnee. <3

## Frequently asked questions

8 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book us about 12-18 months before their wedding date, unless it is for a last minute elopement or a weekday event. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

We shoot our wedding solo unless the guest list is over 120 people or logistically there will need to be 2 photographers at the event, but there is always the option to add on a second photographer to your package. We can discuss all of this during your consultation call.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Yes! Everything that is delivered in your gallery is hand edited by me to make sure it's absolutely perfect. If you would like to see what a full delivered gallery looks like, please reach out!

### Do you also offer video services?

We have a list of videographers we love to work with and will be happy to send you their info!

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

Turnaround time varies by how busy the studio is at that point. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 6-8 weeks after your wedding, and I always try to deliver some sneak peeks within 48 hours of your event.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 12+ years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my associate photographer Julie.
