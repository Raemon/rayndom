  * ### Best Wedding Photo and Video

•Verified review

•Rikita B.•Apr 11, 2025

Stavick Studios was an absolute joy to work with for our wedding day. From the very first interaction, we were impressed by their respectful, direct, and calm communication style. They were consistently kind and made us feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The quality of their work is truly exceptional - their attention to detail is unparalleled, and they are true visionaries when it comes to capturing the most important moments. They went above and beyond to ensure that nearly every moment was documented, even finding me comfortable shoes so we could move more efficiently between locations. Even if you're not a natural in front of the camera, they will guide you through every step and make you feel confident. The sneak peeks they shared with us were nothing short of breathtaking, and we can't wait to see the final edited photos. Stavick Studios is truly the perfect choice to capture your special day.

EJ was a wonderful videographer! He made sure to get a lot of shots from multiple angles and gave us helpful guidance along the way. We could tell he really poured his heart into our wedding video and we could not be more pleased with how it turned out. Thank you!

  * ### Stavick Studios Made Our Wedding Unforgettable

•Verified review

•Andrew P.•Aug 19, 2024

My wife, Meredith, and I had the immense pleasure of working with EJ & Sarah Stavick for our wedding this year, and we cannot recommend Stavick Studios enough! From the very first interaction, EJ & Sarah's communication was exceptional. They made us feel comfortable and confident every step of the way, ensuring that every detail was covered and that our vision was understood. Their organizational skills were impeccable, leaving us stress-free and able to enjoy our big day. On the wedding day, their team was phenomenal. They were everywhere, capturing every special moment, yet they were so discreet that we barely noticed their presence. Their creativity and attention to detail were evident in every shot. The candid moments especially, were some of our favorites. When we received the teaser film and the photos, Meredith and I were left speechless. The quality and artistry of their work are beyond words. Every shot, every frame was beautifully, bringing out the emotions and joy of the day in a way that we will cherish forever. Their passion and dedication were clear in every aspect, from the carefully planned photo setups to the spontaneous video moments they were able to capture. EJ & Sarah are not just talented professionals; they are wonderful people who genuinely care about making your wedding day as special as it can be. We have recommended their services to everyone we know who is looking to capture their special day. They are a dream team, and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Thank you, EJ & Sarah, for your amazing work. You made our memories last a lifetime.

## Frequently asked questions

8 Answers

Ask them a question

### HOW MUCH IS THE DEPOSIT?

We require a 50% deposit to save your wedding date. the remaining balance will be a month before your wedding day.

### HOW MANY WEDDINGS DO YOU TAKE EACH YEAR?

We limit the number of weddings we document so that we can spend valuable time on each one and to ensure couples receive our best work. We focus on quality, not quantity in all areas of our work

### CAN I USE MY OWN MUSIC?

We kindly ask you to give us freedom in choosing the music for Wedding Highlights. The reason is that we don’t want a set of music to dictate the flow of the story that we want to tell and it has to be licensed.

### HOW MANY VIDEOGRAPHERS/ PHOTOGRAPHERS DO I NEED AT MY WEDDING?

You want at least 2 videographers and photographers at your wedding. Don’t get me wrong, 1 videographer / 1 photographer can get the job done, but the video/photo will be better and create more storytelling with 2 shooters. Believe us, we’ve solo shot tons of weddings before.

### DO YOU TRAVEL FOR WEDDINGS?

We are based in California, we serve clients all around the world. Over the past years we have had the privilege of documenting countless love stories within our local community, and each wedding has been a unique and precious experience.

### HOW DO WE RECEIVE OUR PHOTOS?

When the editing is complete, we upload the images to a password-protected online gallery and send it to you via email. You can share the link with friends and family, so they can view your photos. You can also download the whole gallery to your computer. The images are stored online for a year, but we will also mail you the images on a USB as a backup.

### WHAT RIGHTS DO WE HAVE?

You have all rights to download, print, and use your images for personal purposes.

### DO YOU DELIVER RAW PHOTOS OR VIDEOS?

We don’t give out RAW photos or videos. Every photo or films you receive will be edited to ensure consistency in colors, brightness, and mood in a manner reflective of our style.
