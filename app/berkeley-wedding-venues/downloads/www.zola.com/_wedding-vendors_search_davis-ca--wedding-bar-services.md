Hi! We are CRUSH’S Bartending! We are a craft beverage service for anything you feel like celebrating. CRUSH’S combines the ambiance, experience, creativity, and quality of a craft cocktail lounge with the ease and comfort of having a drink with your friends wherever you want to party. We serve up bespoke cocktails, handmade craft mixers, and specialty non-alcoholic options all from behind our handmade wooden bar. So, if you are looking for a stylish, fun, and fully custom experience you have found it with CRUSH’S Bartending!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“You NEED Crush’s at your wedding! Hadyn and Falon were amazing! Knowledgeable, professional, and fun! Seriously, our family & friends are still raving about the cocktails at our wedding. :) We found Crush’s on Instagram and fell in love with the creative and photogenic cocktails they posted. We booked the cocktail bar package for our wedding and they provided us with a tasting of our choice of 4 bottled cocktails to try at home so we could narrow it down to 3. They were all delicious, but we ended up going with the Watermelon Moscow Mule, Open Flame, & Rosehip Dew Drop. They then provided us with a list of liquor we needed to purchase for the selected cocktails, since mobile bars are a “dry-hire” bartending service in CA. On our wedding day, the ladies were on time and helped setup the self-serve beer, wine, non-alcoholic drink buckets, and welcome shots. They provided the buckets, ice, cups, hand-made cocktail mixers, garnishes, etc., and brought their own beautiful wooden bar. They served our 3 cocktails along with straight & mixed shots all night. The cocktails were such a hit, that we ran out of liquor (we had a ton of beer left lol). The ladies offered to run to the liquor store to purchase more and saved the night! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Recommend them 10000%!”Jennifer C., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/8a22154e-5602-4644-9372-933b0253b42b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/crushs-bartending)

For a smaller producer in comparison to some of the major winemakers the standard of the wines has always exceeded expectations to the point where some of my aircraft clients become members and clients of Red Poets. I have never had a problem with service or quality and highly recommend anyone that is considering them as a wine supplier.”Mark Pilkington, 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/red-poets-winery)

Mixmuse 5.0

  * Starts at $500 
  * Serves Davis, CA

At Mixmuse, we believe drinks can be more than just drinks — they can be memories.🧸 I started behind the counter of a tea shop in New York, experimenting with flavors and learning how a simple sip could make someone smile. 🎀 Years later, Mixmuse was born to bring that feeling to weddings and celebrations. Every event we serve is personal — we arrive early, set the scene with décor from our travels, and craft each drink on-site with premium tea leaves, real juice, and organic ingredients. For us, it’s not just about serving drinks — it’s about creating moments your guests will always remember.🌊“Mixmuse is the kind of vendor that truly brings happiness to a wedding. The drinks were phenomenal — you could immediately tell they don’t use syrup but instead real juice and high-quality tea. At the tasting, Amy explained everything to us, and honestly I couldn’t even pick a favorite because they were all so good. On the wedding day, our guests were blown away and kept coming back for more. The table setup was also stunning, filled with unique decorations that Amy and Jimmy collected from their travels. I would 100% recommend them to any couple wanting drinks that make the celebration feel extra special!!!!”Jin, 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/ee8f47ad-d121-4de7-83fc-2fd75100d6e3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/mixmuse)

Tipsy Elephant 5.0

  * Starts at $400 
  * Serves Davis, CA for additional fees

When it comes to curating an unforgettable private event, your choice of bartender defines the experience. At Tipsy Elephant, you’re not just hiring a bartender — you’re securing a craftsman, entertainer, and mixology expert with a passion for both cocktail artistry and third-wave coffee fusion. Every drink is a sensory masterpiece, tailored to your event and designed to leave a lasting impression.“Hiring Mykola for our joint-bachelor party was the highlight of the week! He was extremely easy to work with from our initial consultation to the final farewell cheers. Our party was filled with low-key cocktail snobs, so we wanted to make sure we requested unique cocktails that we could not make ourselves. After a few revisions and recommendations from Mykola, we settled on our final menu, and the drinks exceeded our expectations. Our favorite was the Mezcal Verde! When Mykola arrived, he set up his portable bartending booth, the syrups and garnishes, and even displayed a cute personal menu of our four cocktails. Mykola’s drinks were so tasty that our bachelor party could not concentrate on the Murder Mystery game we had prepared. I still have no idea who the murderer was... Thank you, Mykola, for being the perfect bartender and addition to our celebration week! I will definitely hire you if I get married again!”Randall G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/30050038-9a9e-4bee-8277-04f21ce820aa?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/tipsy-elephant)
