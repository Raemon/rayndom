![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We recently had our wedding at Suisun Valley Inn, and overall, it was a beautiful and memorable experience. One of the biggest highlights was being able to use the venue for three full days, which gave us extra time to relax and connect with our bridal party and loved ones. That extended access truly made a difference in how special the weekend felt. However, there were a few challenges that did impact our plans. The event barn, which was a key part of our original vision, was unfortunately not finished in time for our wedding. While we understand this was out of the owner’s control, we were disappointed that we were not refunded the full 2,000 deposit, especially since the change affected nearly every aspect of our day. Additionally, when we arrived, we were surprised to find the vineyard had been plowed without any prior notice. This forced another last-minute adjustment to our setup so we wouldn’t be facing a dirt lot. It would have been really helpful to have been told about that in advance. Despite these hiccups, the venue itself has so much potential and charm, and we did have a lovely wedding. I just hope some of these experiences can help future couples plan better or spark a few improvements from the venue for the future.”Analisa R., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/024bd0c3-3769-4479-be04-a31009a3418e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

“Domenico Winery was the perfect venue for our wedding celebration. We struggled with finding a venue that was both close to where we lived, fit the number of guests we wanted while also fitting within our price range & the 'vibe' we were going for, but then in came Domenico (right under our noses!) From the very beginning, their communication was prompt, clear, and very open with any questions/customizations we wanted, which made the planning process seamless. They do require at a minimum a day of planner to help ensure the wedding day goes smoothly, and I'm so glad they did as between the venue coordination and wedding planner, I didn't have much to worry about the day of! The industrial, winery-inspired space had a modern and elegant feel that perfectly suited our vision. The staff went above and beyond to make us and our loved ones feel welcome and special, incorporating so many of the unique touches we wanted. The wedding food was amazing, we are still getting compliments from our family members about how Domenico's catering was some of the best wedding food they have ever had (chilean sea bass & short ribs were top hits)! Domenico's preferred vendors list was large & we found excellent vendors to work with (including our photographer & planner) through their recommendations. We were thrilled with how our wedding day turned out and are so grateful to the Domenico team (Karla, Aaron & everyone else!) for helping to make it an unforgettable experience. Would highly, highly recommend an event or wedding here, especially if you are SF Peninsula/Silicon Valley based and looking for a cool, local spot!”Courtney O., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/domenico-winery)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We had the absolute best experience working with Sherry at el PRADO Hotel, and the best wedding day! el PRADO is a gorgeous boutique hotel with so many picturesque spots. Sherry gave us the tasting of our lives where we got dream and plan our wedding over delicious in-house food and wine. She made our fairly fast 3-month planning time so easy and helped us feel so excited and at ease about all of the details of our day. We couldn't have done it without her! So many of our guests loved the hotel, the wines at cocktail hour, and the wedding feast (shoutout their broccoli cheddar soup). el PRADO also gave us a 2-night stay for our wedding weekend, and another night for our 1 anniversary! We would do it all over again el PRADO with Sherry if we could :)”You Jin J., 7 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/el-prado-hotel)

## About wedding venues in Redwood City, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
