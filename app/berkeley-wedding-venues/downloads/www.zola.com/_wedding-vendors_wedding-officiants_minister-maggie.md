I don’t do cookie-cutter ceremonies. I create personalized wedding ceremonies that reflect who you are and what you value as a couple. I want each word to be based on what matters most to you as you join your lives in marriage. We’ll work together to create your perfect ceremony, and I will help you find ways to make your wedding meaningful for yourselves as well as your families and friends. When I lead the ceremony, I’ll speak from my heart with sincerity and joy. Working with you and being at your wedding is an honor I do not take lightly. It would be a privilege to be part of your special day.

Because I have many years of experience as an officiant, I am always prepared, and I know how to stay calm. I won't arrive at the last minute on your wedding day. I'm usually at least an hour early! I also like to be at the rehearsal because it’s important to me to meet attendants, families, and friends to help them feel comfortable with their roles. After the wedding, I’ll take care of getting signatures on the marriage license, and I’ll make sure the license is recorded with the county. And I’m always happy to help with anything you need!

**In three words:** Calm, Creative, Positive

  * ### We love Minister Maggie!

•Verified review

•Kristy M.•Apr 25, 2025

The Mountain Terrace has had the pleasure of working many weddings with Maggie Beretz over the years and she is one of the best officiants you’ll find! Her ceremonies are always so meaningful and heartfelt. And her calm demeanor and professionalism puts everyone at ease on the wedding day…our staff included! She’s incredibly easy to work with and helps couples craft a ceremony that is personal and tailored to them. If you’re looking for a wedding officiant, she is an amazing choice!

  * ### Top recommended officiant

•Verified review

•Mandy S.•Apr 21, 2025

Minister Maggie is always a delight to work with. We've worked together many times over many years. I'm an event planner and she is my "GO TO" most recommended professional officiant. She takes time to get to know the couple and crafts a ceremony that fully reflects them and their wishes. Maggie is an accomplished and clear public speaker. I highly recommend reaching out to Maggie to officiate your wedding!
