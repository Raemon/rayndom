My mission is to bring the luxury of high quality wedding photography to a more affordable price. To serve my couples completely to ensure that they have a stress free and fun wedding day. Everyone should receive the images that they dreamt of on their wedding day, and I believe that when your wedding starts off on the right foot, so does your marriage. And that? That should be a luxury that is available to everyone.

With an engineering background, I have a unique mixture of both logic and creativity. I am able to communicate with my couples in a way that captures their genuine emotions and natural connection. Through my guidance, I create a warm environment where couples and individuals can feel comfortable in front of the camera to be their inherent, unapologetic self.

  * ### The best photographer

•Verified review

•Jaqueline and J.•Feb 11, 2021

We highly recommend working with Regina! She is beyond talented and just the sweetest person with a huge heart. She made us feel at ease when taking photos both at our engagement shoot and wedding day. We feel so happy and grateful that we were able to have her on our big day. We felt like Regina really captured the day beautifully and knew just the things to do (and would go above and beyond) to get the best shot for us. We recommend her whole heartedly to all our friends and family!! She is truly the best and we feel like we walked away with not just the best photos but with a friend as well.

  * ### Unbelievably organized and talented

•AR Weddings N Events•Jan 28, 2021

Regina is absolutely a treasure to work with. She is very kind professional and amazing at what she does. I would be highly recommend her to all couples and planners looking for a great photographer.

  * ### Unbelievably Incredible!

•Verified review

•Marie•Jan 28, 2021

I've worked with Regina countless times on events and weddings. She's also photographed me and my husband. She instantly puts her clients at ease with her fun, relaxed personality. She pays attention to detail and ensures that you feel confident and happy with your photos. Her excitement for her work is contagious. And after the fun of the event or photoshoot is over, she completely WOWS me with the photos she's taken. Her editing style is gorgeous and natural. I couldn't recommend her more!

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 6-13 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame because I only take on 10 weddings a year.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

You get sneak peeks within 24-48 hours. Full gallery turnaround time varies by season, but typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding. Within this time, you can also expect to receive a USB drive with high-resolution image files, so you can share the photos with your loved ones and order prints.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 4 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 50 to 100 images per hour of photographing. Keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.
