Mixmuse 5.0

  * Starts at $500 
  * Serves Berkeley, CA

At Mixmuse, we believe drinks can be more than just drinks — they can be memories.🧸 I started behind the counter of a tea shop in New York, experimenting with flavors and learning how a simple sip could make someone smile. 🎀 Years later, Mixmuse was born to bring that feeling to weddings and celebrations. Every event we serve is personal — we arrive early, set the scene with décor from our travels, and craft each drink on-site with premium tea leaves, real juice, and organic ingredients. For us, it’s not just about serving drinks — it’s about creating moments your guests will always remember.🌊“Booking Mixmuse was one of the best choices we made. Amy and Jimmy brought not only amazing drinks but also a beautifully styled setup with décor from their travels. Every sip felt premium and personal, and our guests loved having boba as an option. It truly elevated the whole celebration.”Jeiane P., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/20c1b99a-610a-4438-b2ce-d0cd3d055470?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/mixmuse)

  * Starts at $600 
  * Serves Berkeley, CA

Derived by the idea of 3 sisters and their individual love of beverages. Handcrafted Cocktails 🍸, Coffee ☕️ & Tea 🫖. Hence Sipsters, a play off sisters and sips! We are a “dry hire” mobile bartending service. This is the concept where we provide the bar, bartender/s, mixers, garnishes and aesthetics and the client provides the alcohol (in which we help you curate a shopping list). This allows the client more flexibility, customization and most importantly cost savings. Meant for those that do not want to pay exuberant mark up on alcohol that venues, bars and restaurants typically charge.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I hired Sipsters for our event, and I couldn't happier with their service! From the very first contact, they were professional, communicative, and attentive to all the details. They worked closely with us to curate a custom drink menu that fit our theme and our guests' tastes. The bartenders arrived on time, set up efficiently, and were ready to serve drinks in no time and even offered help with other things non bartender related. The service was top notch throughout the entire event. They set up, they cleaned up and left it as though they were never there making party planning and clean up so much easier and less stressful. Sipsters exceeded all of our expectations and we thank you so much!”Lindsey, 10 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/6bdefb70-f5a8-402d-9ea4-f163f962bade?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/sipsters--2)

My venue had some very strict alcohol restrictions. Like only canned cocktails They worked with me every step of the way and elevated those canned cocktails so you couldn't even tell that it was cutwaters. They somehow made them taste so much better. They also worked with us to include custom artwork of our pets on cans of beer and cider. They even included that artwork in the custom menu they provided. They also surprised us with an adorable mirror decoration that made its way into a LOT of our photos(pictured below). They were also so nice. All my guests could talk about is how nice they were. They were so responsive every step of the way. My wedding planner said that Candace was the most responsive vendor she's ever worked with. Truly you HAVE to book Lushed and Loaded.”Colette H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/08f07a6a-0342-4c36-85c7-a644b824900d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/lushed-and-loaded)

She’s super welcoming, fun, and really knows how to keep the vibe going. The Spicy Pineapple Mango Margarita was hands-down my favorite but the peach was a close second!!

Highly recommend checking her out for your next event!”Rachel, 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/4fbffa59-988f-4af4-99e8-b153f61e6e31?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bar-services/liquid-luxe-mobile-bartending)
