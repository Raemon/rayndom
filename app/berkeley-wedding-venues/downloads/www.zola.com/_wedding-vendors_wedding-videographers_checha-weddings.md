  * ### Thank you for our unforgettable Sicilian cinema!

•Verified review

•Isabella & N.•Dec 10, 2025

Our Sicilian wedding felt like pure magic, and Sergei captured it with such artistry! We especially treasure the film moments bathed in golden light, the vintage Fiat, and both funny and heartfelt scenes with our family. Every frame carries the atmosphere we dreamed of - like stepping into a beautiful old Italian movie. Sergei’s eye for detail and his ability to tell our story made the day unforgettable. We couldn’t have wished for a better filmmaker, and we will cherish these memories forever. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts! Nate & Isabella

  * ### Wedding video/SDE

•Verified review

•Tarana G.•Feb 26, 2025

Checha Weddings was an absolute joy to work with for our wedding videography. From the very first interaction, Sergei and his team demonstrated an open-minded, fun, and creative approach that put us at ease. As a Sikh-Indian couple, we really appreciated his attention to detail and respect for our traditions. His dedication to capturing every special moment from our special day was extraordinary - the final video they delivered was truly unique and exceeded our wildest expectations. I'm not exaggerating when I say it's been over a year since our wedding and our friends and family will still tell us how much they loved the SDE Sergei created. We 20/10 recommend Checha Weddings to all of our friends and family.

  * ### Sergei is truly a talent!

•Verified review

•Luca•Feb 22, 2025

We couldn’t have asked for a more incredible photographer for our wedding! From start to finish, Sergei was an absolute dream to work with—professional, creative, and deeply passionate about capturing every special moment. The photos are nothing short of breathtaking. Every time we look at them, we are transported back to that magical day, reliving all the emotions, the joy, and even the happy tears. I still get emotional every time I look at our wedding album. These photos are not just pictures—they are memories frozen in time, and we will cherish them forever. If you are looking for a photographer who will exceed your expectations in every way, look no further. Sergei is truly a talent! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for giving us the most beautiful way to relive our wedding day again and again.

  * ### Dreamy video

•Verified review

•Julia•Jan 23, 2025

When we came across one of your videos on YouTube, we immediately thought it was exactly what we wanted as a souvenir of our wedding. You delivered an incredibly well shot and edited film. You were able to capture the emotions and highlights without even understanding the different languages of our mixed wedding. You are a true talent. Our wedding video is a dream, a fairy tale that we relive every time we watch it again. Thank you again for the gift of your talent. And the icing on the cake, you delivered other formats too for Instagram. The package was very complete! The communication was smooth and easy. You knew exactly what to do and that was very reassuring for us to not worry about anything. I'll be recommending your services to everyone out there!
