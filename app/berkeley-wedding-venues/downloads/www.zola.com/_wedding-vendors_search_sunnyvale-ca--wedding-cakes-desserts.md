BÁNH BAKERY 5.0

  * Serves Sunnyvale, CA

BÁNH BAKERY is a cookie-focused bakery, offering small-batch cookies inspired by nostalgic Asian flavors alongside beloved American classics. While “bánh” translates to “cake” in Vietnamese, it’s also a broad term used for many foods—from dumplings and pastries to sticky rice treats and baguettes. We chose the name for its openness and versatility, even though our offerings are exclusively cookies. Rooted in tradition and shaped by our experiences, we bake to honor family, build community, and create second chances—one thoughtfully crafted cookie at a time![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Bánh honors traditional Asian flavors with a new modern twist. They have perfected their sweetness level; not too much and just enough. I’ve ordered variety boxes and dozens of cookies for events such as corporate team offsites, birthdays, baby/bridal showers and bachelorette parties.

Handmade with love and the best ingredients in NYC since 1995.

All made with wholesome ingredients and lots of love.“Negar was so easy to work with and made us an amazing cake for our wedding!

Sf Candy Bar 5.0

  * Serves Sunnyvale, CA

When I opened SF Candy Bar in 2012, the business was busy from the start. In 2012, the economy was just coming out of a recession and Silicon Valley started to attract top talent from all over the world. Experiential add on features, like our candy buffets, was fun at office parties, trade shows and holiday parties. Brides and Mitzvahs also found so much joy in our services. Fast forward to more than a decade later, we have added on more services from popcorn buffets, custom packaged party favors, and trail mix buffets. SF Candy Bar is dedicated to providing stunning buffet designs to guests at special events.“SF Candy Bar provided a candy buffet at our wedding, and it was a total hit! The display was vibrant and inviting, with a wide variety of candies that catered to every taste. From nostalgic favorites to gourmet selections, the spread was thoughtfully curated and beautifully arranged. Our guests, both young and old, couldn't get enough of the colorful array of treats. The setup was elegant and perfectly matched our wedding theme, adding a fun and playful touch to our special day. The team was professional, ensuring everything was flawlessly arranged and replenished throughout the evening. SF Candy Bar made our wedding reception extra sweet and memorable. We couldn’t have asked for a better candy buffet experience!!”Christine H., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/sf-candy-bar)

Mochata | Mochi Donuts + Horchata 5.0

  * Starts at $100 
  * Serves Sunnyvale, CA

Mochata is a home bakery located in Hercules, CA. Our passion lies in crafting exceptional baked mochi donuts and culturally-inspired horchatas. Every creation is meticulously prepared in-house, reflecting our unwavering commitment to quality. We take pride in our continuous exploration and refinement of flavors, with valuable input from our wonderful community. Your support has been instrumental in our journey, and we eagerly anticipate the opportunity to serve you. Thank you for being a part of our success, and we look forward to delighting your taste buds soon!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I've enjoyed mochi donuts from other businesses but someone told me I had to try Mochata and I'm glad I took their word for it. Best mochi donuts hands down that I've had in a long time! I reached out to Erik to inquire about catering mini mochi donuts for my wedding in March 2024 and his customer service was on a whole other level. He was so personable and friendly that I just wanted to order just because of that (go small businesses go!). I asked if he had samples to try and he gladly made a batch and I ended up ordering 5 dozen mini donuts. Everyone at my wedding LOVED them. So much that I didn't even get to have any myself during reception! What stands out the most about Mochata's donuts is that the flavor is actually IN the donut itself. Not just the icing that we're all used to. And the texture? Exactly the way a mochi should taste. Flavors? ON POINT!! The toppings are very generous, especially the Cookies N Cream and Mint Oreo. My absolute favorites are Coconut Pandan, Ube and Strawberries N Cream and my husband always goes for the Mint Oreo. Now that it's post-wedding, I've been having cravings so I ordered more just for my family and I to enjoy. I haven't tried all the flavors yet but I have no doubt that they all taste delicious. I also recently got myself a Thai Horchata drink. I never thought about combining the two flavors together and it was super good! Now I feel like I need to try every flavor of that as well. Thank you Erik for being able to make my wedding day even more special! Definitely plan to be a regular customer for whenever I have a craving.”Phuong D., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/a40fa37f-e12f-4d59-89d2-34e8d98f6c84?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/mochata-mochi-donuts-horchata)

Sweet Condesa LLC 5.0

Welcome. Sweet Condesa is a Filipino & Latin-inspired dessert catering company rooted in Oakland, California. Founded in 2017 by Melody Lorenzo, a Filipina immigrant, self-taught baker, and a former public servant turned entrepreneur who is passionate in creating reimagined desserts that represent heritage and traditions.“We were so happy when we found Melody of Sweet Condesa. Her desserts were the perfect way to incorporate Filipino heritage into our wedding - unique, nostalgic, and absolutely delicious. Her dessert bar was such a hit (every single piece was gone with no leftovers) and our guests loved it. Melody went above and beyond and even custom created desserts from my hometown in the Philippines which was such a special touch! Every year on our anniversary we get desserts from Sweet Condesa to celebrate! Her desserts are so delicious that we try to get them as much as we can during her pop-up events as well.
