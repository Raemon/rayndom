## About this venue

Set on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Slide Ranch combines breathtaking natural beauty with a down-to-earth vibe for your wedding! With a plethora of breathtaking natural vistas & backdrops for wedding events & photos, Slide Ranch is the ideal setting for couples who love the outdoors & want a laid-back atmosphere for their special day. Say “I do” on our sweeping lawns framed by the stunning scenery of the California coast, then party into the night in our yurt. The natural lighting at Slide Ranch is gorgeous, particularly in the late afternoon when the sun is setting over the Pacific. There is also a trail stretching from the wedding ceremony area right down to the sands, which offers plenty of stunning natural locations for couple portraits and sunset shots, backed by the rugged rock formations of the coast. Because Slide Ranch is an environmental education non-profit organization, you know your money is going to a worthy cause.

At Andria Leigh Events we treasure every chance to produce a wedding at Slide Ranch! This venue allows our clients to treat their loved ones to a unique, outdoor wedding experience on the breathtaking, rugged CA coast, with the comforts of gorgeous existing event structures like the dinner deck and yurt (perfect for dancing!). The team goes above and beyond to accommodate requests, and the event is entirely customizable - a hike-in ceremony, yurt dance floor and/or a glamp-out sleepover are such fun and rare options. Perfect for the modern, adventurous or outdoorsy client!
