•Verified review

•Hongan N.•Sep 5, 2025

Moment.us Bay Area was a wonderful choice for our corporate event photography. From the very first interaction, the team was incredibly friendly and inviting, putting us at ease and making the process seamless. They were also highly informative, answering all of our questions and providing great guidance on the day-of logistics. The quality of their work was fantastic - they captured all the key moments of our event beautifully. We were thrilled with the final photos and felt we received excellent value for the cost. I would highly recommend Moment.us Bay Area for any corporate or business event in need of professional, high-quality photography services.
