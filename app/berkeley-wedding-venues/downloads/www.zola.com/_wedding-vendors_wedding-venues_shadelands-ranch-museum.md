  * ### Elegance Meets Affordability!

•Verified review

•Samantha G.•Nov 25, 2024

We had our wedding at Shadelands Ranch Museum in 2018 and couldn't have been happier with our decision! We had a few parameters to work within — a tight budget, a list of vendors we wanted to work with, and a large guest count. The staff at Shadelands were incredibly accommodating and easy to partner with. Since their policy allows food trucks and other mobile caterers, we were able to hire one of our favorite local BBQ restaurants to cater, which was a huge hit. The venue grounds are large enough to fit a sizeable group — perfect for our guests who brought children — they had plenty of room to run around on the lawn. In the summer, the venue adds string lights in the trees around their gazebo, creating a beautiful and romantic touch when the sun sets. The gazebo served as a beautiful centerpiece and the location for our photo booth. Our DJ had plenty of space to set up on the back patio, which doubled as the dance floor. The venue’s accessibility was incredible, with ample parking, clean restrooms, a kitchen, and a porch for the bride to ‘hide’ until the ceremony. And because the venue provided the tables and chairs, we only needed to rent table linens. Shadelands is the place to book if you want a beautiful and affordable outdoor wedding venue in Walnut Creek that can accommodate both your ceremony and reception. The attentive staff, accessible location, and flexibility around customization make it an ideal place to tie the knot!
