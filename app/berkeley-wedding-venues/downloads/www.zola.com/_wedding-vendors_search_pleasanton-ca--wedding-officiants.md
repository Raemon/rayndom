The Out Officiant 5.0

  * Offers 7 ceremony types
  * Starts at $187 
  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

Hola, I’m Ernesto (he/him/él), The Out Officiant! Ordained by the ULC, I began officiating in 2019 and bring heart, humor, and authenticity to every ceremony. As a gay Latino who’s been through wedding planning myself, I know how vital it is to feel seen and supported. I specialize in LGBTQ+, bilingual, and multicultural weddings, always inclusive, personalized, and stress-free. Based in El Cerrito, my fee varies by distance. Let’s create a ceremony that celebrates your love story!“Ernesto is the best officiant! He met with us prior to see what we would like incorporated into the ceremony, he showed up last minute to our rehearsal after we forgot to tell him about it, and overall incorporated his humor/personality to make our ceremony truly special! Highly recommend him!”Fahima, 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/9c02a433-6a3c-4597-a4ab-28941f6074a2?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/the-out-officiant)

I Do X Two 5.0

  * Offers 9 ceremony types
  * Starts at $400 
  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

I love working with couples to write a ceremony that is authentic to their love story and with all the details they envision. I've officiated estate-sized wine country weddings and those at the Ritz; to ceremonies in art galleries and country clubs, to shoreline and backyard elopements, and vow renewals at a family picnic or a restaurant--each one just as special as the other.“Saundra is a professional and easy to work with. She really knew how to make our ceremony extra special. From her coordination and help during the rehearsal she made the ceremony go forward smoothly. She was also very communicative and helpful in filing the final marriage license. I would recommend Saundra to any couple getting married in the Bay Area.”Omar Q., 12 days ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/i-do-x-two)

I don’t do cookie-cutter ceremonies. I create personalized wedding ceremonies that reflect who you are and what you value as a couple.

It would be a privilege to be part of your special day.“The Mountain Terrace has had the pleasure of working many weddings with Maggie Beretz over the years and she is one of the best officiants you’ll find!

I collaborate with the wedding couple to design and write a deeply personal custom wedding script and then coach their designated officiant to deliver it with ease and joy. After officiating over 600 ceremonies, I am now collaborating with couples to design and write their wedding ceremony and then coaching a friend or family member to deliver it with ease and joy. Over half the weddings in the United States are now performed by family or friends because it creates tremendous warmth and intimacy in the ceremony. However, asking someone to write and officiate a complete wedding ceremony can be overwhelming if they have never done it before.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/ceremonies-for-sacred-days)

Shundo David Haye, Zen Priest 5.0

  * Offers 10 ceremony types
  * Starts at $400 
  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

I have been a Zen Priest since 2009, and have been officiating weddings since 2011. To everything I do I bring fifteen years of residential zen training at San Francisco Zen Center, including five years of intense monastic training at Tassajara, and many silent retreats. As a wedding officiant I am proud to have performed many same-sex marriages, and many of the couples I have married have been multi-cultural. I am often asked to wear my Buddhist robes for the ceremony, but that is entirely up to the couple. Ceremonies have ranged in size from the couple, me and the photographer, to much more formal settings for up to two hundred people.“As fellow meditators, it was a joy to have Shundo officiate our wedding. Shundo's communication style was clear, helpful, and timely throughout the process. He gladly scheduled Zoom calls to learn more about us and to guide us through the vows process (one that we were unknowledgeable about XD). He was also very flexible when we wanted to change how the ceremony was structured. Shundo's work was sincere, compassionate, happy, and joyful.

  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

Lawrence E. Adjah, MBA, M.Ed, M.Div. is a pastor, marriage counselor and best-selling author on relationships. Lawrence specializes in marriage counseling and one-on-one spiritual advisory. He approaches his guidance in a biblically based, structured, relatable, and systematic manner, with clear owned outcomes and next steps. Lawrence will guide you through the wedding planning process with warmth, intentionality and clarity. Lawrence offers a wide array of services to guide you through your wedding and beyond. He provides both wedding officiating services and vow renewals, as well as pre-marital counseling and ongoing marriage counseling.“My husband and I worked with Pastor Lawrence for a year of faith-based pre-marital counseling and had an amazing experience. We, like many couples, went into our first session thinking we’d already discussed the most important topics and we’d maybe need to do 3 formal pre-marital counseling sessions. Our first session was so impactful that we immediately decided that we wanted a full year of counseling. That decision, we believe, completely changed the trajectory of our marriage. Pastor Lawrence asked difficult, thought-provoking questions that helped us see our relationship (with each other and with God) in new ways, and each session left us feeling better equipped for marriage than we ever expected. His depth of knowledge, approachability, and ability to guide meaningful, relevant conversations aimed at aligning us as one—even when we thought we had nothing new to discuss—was truly a gift. We are so grateful for the wisdom and encouragement he poured into us throughout this process and would highly recommend him to any couple who is looking to build a strong, Christ-centered foundation going into their marriage.”Veronica B., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/8b7fccf1-cea7-4f83-8a81-582deb7f95e4?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/lawrence-e-adjah-mba-m-ed-m-div)

Your ceremony doesn't have to be "cookie cutter" or "run of the mill." I work with all my couples to present a ceremony that truly reflects your relationship. My goal is to ensure that you and your guests experience a meaningful and entertaining wedding ceremony to start your special day.“We hired Pamela to officiate our October wedding in Massachusetts after searching online for LGBTQ-friendly officiants, and she was absolutely amazing! From our very first meeting, we knew we had made the right choice. She was professional, experienced, reassuring, personable, and so easy to work with throughout the entire process. Pamela took the time to get to know us and crafted a ceremony that felt deeply personal and true to our love story, which was so special. Several of our guests commented on how captivating the ceremony was and were surprised to learn that we hadn’t known Pamela beforehand. She also guided us through the marriage license process and made it very easy and stress-free. We would highly recommend her to any engaged couple looking for a thoughtful, inclusive, and exceptional officiant.

Hi, I'm David Gomes Your Officiant! Every couple comes with a unique story, a unique path that has brought them together, I'm here to make your story officially tie in together!

He provided three services for our wedding. He was our minister for the ceremony, the DJ during our reception, and his wife also ran a photo booth. My wife and I highly recommend their services. Leading up to our wedding day, David provided incredibly helpful suggestions in planning our ceremony and reception. In addition to the phone calls and emails, communicating all the details was made very simple through an online portal. It made selecting music and building out our ceremony and reception easy. My wife and I loved the speech he prepared for our ceremony and our guests all loved the music and photo booth. We gladly recommend their services to our family, friends, and anyone planning a wedding.”Ryan M., 9 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/a-loving-promise-ceremony)
