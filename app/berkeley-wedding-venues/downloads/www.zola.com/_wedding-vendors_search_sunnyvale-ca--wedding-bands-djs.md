The Celebration DJ 5.0

  * DJ
  * Starts at $1,400 
  * Serves Sunnyvale, CA
  * Offer

I’ve been playing weddings for over twelve years and I love my work! My services cover any or all aspects of wedding & receptions. I have found my life’s artistic calling in becoming flexible to every type of music my clients could desire. I learn to enjoy whatever my clients love and this resonance makes my job sustainable and ever-enjoyable. But, I do tend to request the ability to make choices for the dance-floor that rely on my years of dance-enhancing experience. I meet with my clients to determine what music they would love to hear and what music they do NOT want to hear.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We’d experienced some strange DJ moments at other weddings - airhorns, over the top transitions, self advertising - so we were feeling picky as we embarked on the first DJ search of our own. Celebration DJ stood out to us, and the ability to hire a DJ who can also sing and play guitar was an enticing combo. Brandon did a fabulous job bringing his professional experience to the day - we really wanted a packed dance floor and he delivered. The photobooth and its quirky props were a huge hit with our guests, and the GIFs that were available afterwards are so fun and unique! We also loved that we could collaborate on playlists via Spotify - made it easy and now we can continue to listen to our wedding music for years to come. Thank you Brandon and the Celebration DJ team!”The H., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/a2b1a39c-7b12-43f7-8a8e-39512c93130b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/the-celebration-dj)

From the very beginning, Aaron and his team demonstrated excellent communication, holding several Zoom calls with us to thoroughly plan out every detail of the event. They were incredibly helpful in figuring out all the technical aspects, and their level of professionalism was top-notch. On the day of our wedding, Aaron and his crew made sure that friends and family watching from home were able to live stream the ceremony, and they worked seamlessly with our event coordinator to ensure the timeline went off without a hitch. Aaron had been working with us for months leading up to the big day, triple-checking every detail to make sure everything happened exactly as we wanted. We are so grateful for the incredible service HSLE provided - they truly went above and beyond to make our special day perfect.”Tim D., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/c8ca8553-c35f-4279-b3cf-108c6164bbc6?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/hsle-production-group)

Golden Bell offers a unique musical blend that packs a high-energy punch! The DJ/live fusion band, or DJ/live band hybrid, is always anchored on a DJ set but supported by live musicians. With all the energy and hype of a live band and the flexibility of a DJ, you won’t have to decide between hiring a band or a DJ for your next event or wedding.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Golden Bell Music was worth EVERY penny AND MORE! It's been 6 months since my wedding and I'm STILL getting comments on how much fun all our guests had! Even my mother-in-law who doesn't dance did NOT sit down! I'm Lebanese and my husband is Israeli, so I had asked for help mixing songs to combine our cultures and then move into more western music. I'm still getting sooooo many compliments from our families on how we were able to combine our traditions and our music! And our guests LOST IT when they came out on the dance floor with their instruments and danced with us! I did this in lieu of a zaffet group because i wanted something more unique -- in lebanon a drumline would follow the bride and groom and dance/perform for guests -- and it was definitely the right choice!!! On top of their amazing performance, Marlon was **insanely helpful** both leading up to the day and on the day. I didn't have a wedding planner and was making last minute decisions/timeline changes myself the day of. I couldn't have done it so smoothly without Marlon being so helpful as an MC and being so willing to roll with it! He was absolutely fantastic!! Cut your budget wherever you can to make sure you can hire them. It's SO worth it! Thank you Golden Bell Music for making it the best day of summer (so i've been told. multiple times. by different guests.)!! I don't know for what occasion, but I'm 100% going to find a reason to hire them again.”Monique G., 24 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/38e00d33-8b3e-430d-b583-9b3b95d659ae?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/golden-bell-music)

Spencer was incredibly insightful, experienced, and innovative in ways that challenge standard DJ services. He offered everything from full service music and audio with club-style transitions, to station and bistro lighting, and ensured that his equipment was elegant and well suited to the venue. His style incorporated both our personal music selections, crowd pleasers, and was able to adjust to the crowd. From the time our dance floor opened to the time it closed, it was never empty. Every compliment were received the morning after the wedding included some mention of how great the DJ was, and how our Tuesday night wedding had such incredible energy. Spencer had our wedding guests doing the worm, the splits, dropping it low, and singing like no one was listening. Thank you, Spencer, for making our special day incredibly memorable and a true party!”Thomas and B., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/sutherland-entertainment)

Hello! We are an esteemed collective of professional string musicians based in the San Francisco Bay Area, dedicated to bringing beautiful, live string quartet music to weddings and private events. We offer vibrant performances of romantic wedding favorites, contemporary popular hits, and timeless classics that will make your event truly memorable.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From the start, we had no worries because communication was excellent, even a few days prior to the wedding when we had some changes to make. There were so many things not going as planned on the wedding day, it was a relief to not have to worry about the music. Before the ceremony, the musicians checked to make sure every cue was correct, and even with some flubs with our officiant, they adjusted perfectly so that no one knew something went awry. They even changed their volume moment to moment to fit the mood of our mid-ceremony songs! My favorite moment was during our "Concerning Hobbits" recessional and pictures; my best man was in tears with the combination of their incredibly beautiful rendition while the whole wedding party stood together for their pictures before dinner. It could not have been more perfect. The cocktail hour and dinner music was also just what we wanted, and we were able to ask for a few special requests before leaving the venue. We cannot recommend the Bellissima Quartet highly enough!”Max H., 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/bellissima-music)

I’m DJ Buddy Holly – Performed by David Charles Kramer, a professional DJ, guitarist, and vocalist based in Northern California. I provide elegant sound, lighting, and entertainment for weddings, receptions, and private events. Music has been my life since childhood — from playing guitar and singing live to mixing dance-floor favorites that keep guests celebrating all night long. I work closely with every couple to plan playlists, announcements, and timing that reflect their personality and vision. Whether it’s a romantic ceremony, a smooth dinner set, or an epic party finale, I bring professional sound and the right energy for every moment.“Our wedding wouldn’t have been half as fun without DJ Buddy Holly! From the ceremony music to the last dance, everything flowed perfectly. He read the crowd like a pro—grandparents were dancing next to our college friends, and the transitions were seamless. The lighting setup made the whole venue glow, and his announcements kept things organized but never cheesy. You can tell he genuinely cares about making it the best night ever. Highly recommend for anyone who wants their dance floor packed all night!”Sarah M., 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/dj-buddy-holly)

There are truly no words big enough to describe how special Cello Joe was as our wedding DJ. He wasn’t just a part of our wedding day, he made our wedding day. From the very first moment to the very last song, he gave us something so magical, so unforgettable, that it still makes us emotional to think about. He was literally the heartbeat of our day. He played live cello pre ceremony for all the guests to enjoy that was truly so beautiful. But the live cello as I walked down the aisle is a memory etched into our hearts forever. It was more than music. It felt like the soundtrack to our love story, and it was the most beautiful beginning to the rest of our lives. Then, during cocktail hour, he transformed the atmosphere with looping, beatboxing, and cello in a way that left every single guest completely captivated. People couldn’t stop talking about it, and even now, they’re still telling us it was the most unique and breathtaking performance they’ve ever experienced at a wedding from start to finish. And then there was the saxophonist he brought in during the dance party. pure magic. Together, they created an energy that was electric, soulful, and overflowing with joy. They didn’t just entertain, they touched every heart in the room. Not only was he the most talented cello musician, he absolutely crushed the dance party and played non stop for 3:30 hours. Not one bad song or bad mix. It was absolutely incredible. But what truly sets him apart is how much heart he pours into what he does. Without us even knowing, he recorded our entire ceremony, our cocktail hour, our dance floor, and gifted us not just music, but memories. He allowed us to relive the most important day of our lives again and again. That level of thoughtfulness is beyond anything we could have imagined. Our wedding was perfect because of him. He exceeded every expectation and gave us more than we ever dreamed possible. He is, without question, the most talented, kind, and extraordinary musician and DJ we have ever met. If we could give him more than 5 stars, we would. To us, he isn’t just the best wedding DJ in the world, he’s someone we will forever be grateful for, someone who gave us the gift of a wedding day that truly felt like a dream. Cello Joe, thank you for all the moments you created throughout our weekend. You truly are one of the most talented people we’ve ever met and I will be recommending you to everybody I know!!”Sarah T., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/4894f066-7c76-4c53-b751-6e5999610902?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/cello-joe-productions)
