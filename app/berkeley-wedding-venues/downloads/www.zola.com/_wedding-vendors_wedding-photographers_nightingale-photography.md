Hi, I'm Christina Hernandez, and I am passionate about emotional, documentary photography. After working 15 years as a staff photojournalist at the San Francisco Chronicle, I've taken my years of experience to create rich, memorable images for my couples. My goal is to create a photo gallery that tells YOUR story. You are unique and your images should be, too. I cry at weddings. I can't help it! I get emotionally invested and I won't apologize for it. It allows me to get into the zone where I am completely immersed in the moment and I strive to make images that reflect that. I love being inspired by new locations, and I go with the flow.

  * ### The dream

•Verified review

•Helen and E.•Jul 28, 2020

Christina was amazing, her photos are beautiful and she is so wonderful to work with! We didn't really know what wedding photos we wanted specifically, and she just curated us and the photos, and they turned out brilliantly. She isn’t intrusive during the ceremony, we didn’t even notice her and nor did our guests -yet there were so many photos! She is very responsive to emails, texts and calls. She does great check-ins and even asked if we needed help with anything the day before. She is the best and I would recommend her to anyone and everyone!

## Frequently asked questions

7 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 13 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you shoot with assistants or other photographers?

Sometimes, I’ll bring one or more assistant photographers depending on the size of your wedding.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### Do you also offer video services?

Absolutely, our style is cinematic and emotional

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding. Within this time, you can also expect to receive a USB drive with high-resolution image files, so you can share the photos with your loved ones and order prints.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 12 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to shoot your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.
