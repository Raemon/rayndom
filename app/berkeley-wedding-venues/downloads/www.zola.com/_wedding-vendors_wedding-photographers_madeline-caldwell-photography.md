I have been passionate about photography since I can remember! My dad also photographed weddings, and i remember going along with him to some of his weddings as his " assistant" when i was younger! Isn't it funny how things work out sometimes?!

What sets me apart from other photographers is I actually LOVE being in Front of the camera also! I have a past in freelance modeling, so I am ALWAYS sure to achieve your best angle no matter what! I know how to pose, what looks most flattering, and what looks awkward. I've participated in a numerous amount of styled wedding shoots, so I do understand what its like to constantly have your photo taken while in heels and a huge dress! I understand you, and I vow to be your right hand, bring you water if you need it, and always achieve your most flattering angle to deliver you the best photos possible!

•Verified review

•Sarah + T.•Mar 6, 2022

If you’ve been searching for he right photographer, you’ve found her! She was fantastic to work with and the photo turn around and quality were amazing. I know working with photographers can be anxiety inducing sometimes, but she made the whole session very comfortable. Love love!

  * ### Timeless, high quality, detail oriented

•Verified review

•Parker B. - Jane Dough•Mar 3, 2022

Working with Madeline Caldwell Photography was such a dream! As a wedding cake vendor, I don’t have a hand in who captures my creations on the big day and I was so fortunate to have Madeline shoot my cakes! Madeline is so detail oriented and captured every moment beautifully! Not only that, she was so professional to work with and was so timely and gracious to share her gallery! She captured the cake’s angles beautifully and the photos were very high quality! Like I said, I was extremely fortunate to work with Madeline and I am so looking forward to working together in the future!

  * ### Excellent photographer

  * ### Engagement Photos

•Verified review

•Hailey + R.•Mar 3, 2022

Madee did our surprise engagement photos and they turned out amazing! She’s so good at what she does and not only does she capture THE picture, but her edits all the way down to her lens quality is worth every penny! I 10/10 recommend her and her work!
