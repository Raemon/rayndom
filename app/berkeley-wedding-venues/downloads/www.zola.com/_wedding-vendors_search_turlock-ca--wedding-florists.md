Erica Gravel Design 5.0

  * Serves Turlock, CA

With 8 years and counting of experience in the wedding industry and 5 years specializing in floral design, I bring a seasoned eye for detail and refined artistry to every celebration. My signature style blends luxury with an organic touch, creating floral experiences that feel timeless and unforgettable.“Flowers were one of the most important parts of my daughter’s 2024 wedding, and I cannot express how thankful we are that we chose Erica Gravel Design. From the very first conversation, Erica listened with such care and truly understood how significant the flowers were to us. Her knowledge of the floral world put us at ease throughout the entire process and was quick to explain things about flowers and seasonality that we didnt understand (like peonies!) and offer ideas of substitutes which is so valuable, she felt like a guide hrough the whole process and we were so happy to have someone who was an expert in our corner. On the wedding day, when I walked into the space and saw the flowers, I was overwhelmed, She has an incredible design eye, and it showed in the way she transformed the venue into something magical and unforgettable. We received endless compliments from our guests, many of whom said the florals were the most beautiful they had ever seen at a wedding. My daughter was moved to tears when she saw her bouquet. It was everything she had dreamed of and more. The flowers truly set the tone for the entire day. Erica not only delivered gorgeous florals, but she also made the entire process enjoyable and stress free. Her professionalism, creativity, and dedication are unmatched. We will always remember the role she played in making my daughter’s wedding day as beautiful and meaningful as it was. I cannot recommend her highly enough and would not hesitate to book her again for any event.”Susan N., 5 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/erica-gravel-design)

We couldn't have been happier with Something Borrowed Blooms and highly recommend them to any couple planning their wedding.”Jazmine N., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/22e42a62-f2cd-4c93-9b6f-9bb0347ac54c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/something-borrowed-blooms)

Flower Moxie – Do-It-Yourself Wedding Flowers 4.9

  * Starts at $350 
  * Serves Turlock, CA

In 2013, 8-year wedding veteran Amy McCord Jones realizes she wouldn't be able to afford to hire her own floral services if she was a bride. Then, Amy discovers that there is basically zero help available for DIY brides. No flower recipes. No instructions. No access to florist-grade blooms. Rude. So she launches Flower Moxie! Flower Moxie remains a humble, tucked-away small business out of Oklahoma City. We don’t zoom around on scooters in some fancy high-rise. We stock an average kitchen with canned wine and Aldi chips and listen to true crime podcasts while photographing curvy ranunculus. Join us. There’s cake, hugs, and acceptance here.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I ordered the "peaches and cream" small package. We decided to skip on ceremony florals, and only have handhelds and bud vases at the reception. We did buy a few more flowers from the grocery to add more peach once the flowers arrived. We made and medium sized bridal bouquet, 4 bridesmaids bouquets, 3 corsages, and 7 bouts. (With lots of flowers left over). My bridesmaids and I did the arranging the morning before the wedding; it was fun, and a great start to the weekend. None of us had experience, but it all turned out great! If you or your bridal party are mildly crafty, I'd highly recommend it!”Hallie H., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/0545197f-548a-48ed-8a0f-eb1fb7f740bb?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/flower-moxie)

After serving the Bay Area for years, I've moved to Lincoln and looking forward to serving our new community. A little about me: Always lived in the country raising cattle and horses. Grew up learning from mother about all things florals. Worked in vet med for years while also doing wedding flowers with my mother. Now that my husband and I have moved to Lincoln I decided to start my floral business full time.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Heather was a dream vendor to work with. She helped make this vision come to life- from planning, strategizing my budget, introducing me to different ideas and creating pieces that I was able to use during my ceremony and repurpose for my reception. She was so understanding, flexible, easy to work with and gave me the most grace when I was undecided on something. She is patient and kind and I couldn’t recommend anyone else on such a stressful/important day- she goes above and beyond. Her communication is excellent and her attention to detail is immaculate. Our flowers were beautiful and high quality. All of the pieces were put together with excellent care and didn’t fall apart. Our boutonnières were magnets- easy for the men to put on! She created a pocket boutonnière for the groom that was so different and special. My bridal bouquet was the perfect size and wasn’t heavy at all! She even did our petals for our flower girls. Heather, we loved working with you and look forward to future events where you can help execute our next vision. Thank you for everything and all of your hard work .

From her professionalism down to her attention to detail, there was not a single step of the planning process that we were not completely blown away by Autumn and her work! During the early phases of our wedding planning process, we had received 6 different floral proposals from various florists local to the Bay Area. Autumn's proposal blew every other company's out of the water! Coming in at 20 pages, her proposal outlined our color pallet and inspo photos for the conceptual design, the exact flowers (with pictures) she chose based on our vision, the exact vessels, candles, and candle holders she had in mind, and pricing for each bouquet, boutonniere, and arrangement. Shortly after receiving her proposal, and prior to making our final decision on florist, I flew into San Fran on a last-minute work trip. I reached out to her literally as I was touching down at SFO to see if she was available to meet at our venue to go over design and vision. Autumn immediately dropped everything and met me on site within an hour! That alone earned our business - she was committed to us and our vision from the very beginning. Throughout the planning process, Autumn ensured my husband I stayed involved in the decision making process, regularly sending options for different vessels, candles, candle holders, ribbon selections, and design preferences. On the week of the wedding, she asked if I would like updates as she arranged our florals to which I said OF COURSE! Daily she sent me the sweetest photos and videos of the bouquets, aisle arch, etc. which was the shining light pulling me through an incredibly stressful and busy final week of planning/travel! We truly cannot speak highly enough about Autumn, her amazing work, her attention to detail, and professionalism throughout the entire process! Our wedding day went off without a hitch and it was SO FUN seeing her on the day of our wedding after 2 years of planning together!

Vita Fiori creates flowers that evoke feeling and tell stories. We create art. We believe in celebrating the one life you get to live. This is your wedding, babe. Let's make it unforgettable. Our style is whimsical and romantic; we like to create florals so breathtaking, your guests stop and say, "Wow. I've never seen anything like this before."![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We are so grateful to have worked with Johannah of Vita Fiori for our wedding! From start to finish, she made the process so easy and stress-free. She provided us with beautifully detailed PDFs that outlined every arrangement, flower choice, and cost breakdown, which gave us so much confidence in the planning process. On the wedding day, every piece she created was stunning—whimsical, thoughtful, and perfectly in line with our color scheme. Johannah incorporated both mine and my husband’s birth month flowers into the bridal bouquet and boutonnière, which made them so personal and meaningful. From the bouquets and boutonnières to the aisle markers, bud vases, candles, and even the greenery for our seating chart, every detail felt intentional and artfully designed. The ceremony altar pieces and bar arrangement were breathtaking focal points that our guests couldn’t stop complimenting. Having her handle both setup and takedown was such a gift—it allowed us to be fully present and enjoy our celebration without worrying about logistics. Johannah truly went above and beyond, and her talent and professionalism shine through in every arrangement. If you’re looking for a florist who combines artistry, organization, and heart, I can’t recommend Vita Fiori enough!”Julia J., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/c237cebf-98db-44e6-8090-d0cd381c4485?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/vita-fiori)

You’ll know exactly how many stems go into each bouquet, centerpiece, boutonniere — and how to assemble them step-by-step. Choose one of our DIY flower kits or get a custom plan based on your colors, style, and budget.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“The flowers (on our order) came in large boxes, but they were not labeled, so it took a minute to get the flowers both identified and properly set up. To be fair we were warned about the process, but not about the length of time due to our inexperience. As a note, it took my fiancé 5 hours to process the flowers when first receiving them. I also did not have any updates from them from the time I ordered till they were being shipped. They were beyond more affordable compared to other florists, and the flowers arrived alive and in good spirits. We were able to keep the flowers alive for over four days!! Many of the flowers that we chose did not have specific instructions, so we had to follow the general reference for the flowers and hope for the best. Additionally, some of the flowers that we wanted were not in stock, and they were replaced for us with substitutes but were not notified until we had all of the flowers already delivered to us. Also, as a note, bloom culture uses third party sellers for their flowers, so the quality may vary depending on location. Our flowers were in good condition, and the company we had clearly took good care of the flowers prior to delivering them to us. Would we do it again? Probably not, but it made for good laughs and bonding time and we have stories to tell from it!”Hannah H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/36a6f8b7-2bac-47a0-89d6-63ff0d0d678c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/bloom-culture-flowers)

They made our bridal party’s bouquets and boutonnieres, and every single one looked amazing. Their prices were very reasonable too. Maryem was so sweet and fantastic to work with - we sent her a reference photo for the bouquets, and she was able to recreate the exact same ones and then also matching boutonniere versions. She coordinated delivery the day of the wedding, and even was able to make a couple last minute changes to the groom’s boutonniere after we found out his suit would be a different color. Truthfully I had never really thought about preserving my bouquet after the wedding, but I loved mine so much that I ended up pressing the flowers myself so that I could keep them. I would highly recommend Moon Florist to anyone looking for a wedding florist!!”Anna F., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/d43800b3-05ab-4430-b2dc-8f66b33f7e31?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/moon-florist--2)
