Ethere was a pleasure to work with for our wedding event extras. Her communication was quick and efficient, which was greatly appreciated during the hectic planning process. The quality of their work was excellent, with great attention to detail that really elevated feel of our special day. They added a lovely personalized touch that our guests raved about. It's clear that the owner, She, very clearly loves what she does, and it shows in the passion and care she puts into her work.
