On the day of, Caislyn was great at working with our vendors and working with our timeline. She made sure to constantly check in with us, making sure all our needs were addressed including making sure we had our food, our drinks were full (including getting us our boba) and making sure we had a piece of pizza from our late night snack. Her attention to detail is unmatched. She was able to capture our best day ever so beautifully! She was able to capture some precious moments not only between us, but also with our guests. She was able to deliver our reels and content in a timely matter. Max and I could not stop rewatching it all every time she sent us new content!

At Bodi Botanica we offer custom wedding scents and interactive fragrance experiences that make your celebration unforgettable.

The bride and groom wanted a very atypical, nature-centric event, that was collaborative, creative, and activity-filled. Almost all of the guests went home with a personal scent they were super excited about. The ideation process was interactive, informative (but fun), and very supportive. I definitely recommend BB for any type of event to mix up the often outdated, regularly scheduled programming!”Colleen, 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/6c7503a1-36a4-42cb-b27f-e0f69fa2211c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/bodi-botanica)

Festa is an AI event coordinator that transforms how modern events are run — starting with weddings. Instead of juggling group chats, spreadsheets, and endless back-and-forth, Festa manages RSVPs, guest questions, and real-time updates directly through text.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Using Festa was honestly one of the best choices we made. We had a three-day wedding weekend, and coordinating everything—from the welcome drinks to the farewell brunch—would’ve been a nightmare without it. Festa texted guests with the schedule, answered their questions (like “What time’s the shuttle?”), and even followed up with people who hadn’t RSVP’d yet. I didn’t even realize how much stress it was saving us until our friends with other weddings were freaking out. This should be standard at every wedding.”Danielle R., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/festa-ai--2)

Open Haven offers restorative sound experiences that bring calm, presence, and connection to your most meaningful moments. A wedding weekend can move quickly - the happy rush of hellos, reunions, and celebration all at once. Beginning with a sound bath invites everyone to pause, breathe, and unwind together, allowing the mind and body to simply be present in the moment. For your moment. Known for her warm, intuitive approach, Ariana weaves sound, stillness, and gentle reflection to create experiences that leave guests feeling lighter, calm, and deeply connected - to themselves, to one another, and to the love being celebrated.“We had the absolute joy of having Open Haven Sound Bath kick off our wedding weekend, and it was truly magical. Our guests were welcomed with an incredible sound bath experience nestled among the pine trees on the rooftop above the pool — the perfect way to ground everyone and set a calm, intentional tone for the weekend. Ariana, the owner of Open Haven, created an atmosphere that felt deeply personal to us as a couple — even crafting a custom scent (pine & rose) that she used during the sound bath and gifted to our guests afterward. It was such a thoughtful and meaningful touch that everyone is still talking about. Her ability to create connection, presence, and serenity through sound is unmatched. It was the perfect beginning to our celebration, and we couldn’t recommend Open Haven Sound Bath more highly to anyone looking to bring a sense of peace and beauty to their event”Sarah, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/393f0e03-d7c7-48ea-b945-8728044088b0?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/open-haven)

Let’s create something beautiful, heartfelt, and totally you — because your day deserves to be relived over and over again. 🤍![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Kathlena from To Have & Hold is nothing short of magical. She has an incredible eye for detail and a gift for capturing the moments you didn’t even realize would mean so much until you saw them again. The reels she created for my wedding were beyond anything I could have imagined. She truly brought all my TikTok and Instagram dreams to life! She curated the most stunning content that felt so us, and I loved how candid, romantic, and joyful they were. Her editing style is clean, modern, and tailored perfectly for social media. She manages to take just a few seconds of video or a simple glance between people and turn it into something that makes you feel everything all over again — the love, the laughter, even the happy tears. Kathlena was also such a calming and positive presence throughout the day. She was very professional, warm, and incredibly easy to work with. She blended in so effortlessly while still managing to get the best behind-the-scenes footage. If you’re looking for someone who can bring your wedding day back to life in a way that feels emotional, cinematic, and completely personal, look no further. Kathlena doesn’t just create videos, she tells love stories. And I am forever grateful for how she told ours.”Kaylee D., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/b9e787a1-92f8-48a4-b545-203eaaefd1e1?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/to-have-and-hold-content-creation--2)

We had guests staying across San Francisco, Oakland, and Palo Alto, and coordinating transportation could have been a nightmare — but BNG made it absolutely seamless. Their team was professional, responsive, and incredibly kind from start to finish. The vehicles were immaculate, the chauffeurs were early and prepared, and our guests were genuinely impressed by the experience. They handled everything from multi-stop pickups in downtown SF and the East Bay to smooth, on-time drop-offs at our venue in Woodside. The return shuttles from the Mountain Terrace back to different hotels across the Bay Area went just as smoothly. If you're planning a wedding anywhere in the Bay Area, especially in San Francisco, Oakland, or the South Bay, don’t think twice — BNG is the best. We felt like VIPs the entire time, and they played a big part in keeping our day stress-free and memorable.

Dejane Jane De Art 5.0 Alamo, CA

  * Starts at $2,000 
  * Serves California

Hi, I'm Jane from DejaneJanedeArt, a watercolor artist based in NY and Bay Area Northern California, but available for destination weddings internationally. Want to give a wedding gift that’s as unique and personal as the couple’s love story? Live wedding painting is an interactive and memorable experience. This allows your guests to watch as I create a beautiful artwork in real-time, capturing the magic of your celebration right before their eyes. As a result, the couple will receive a fully framed, ready-to-hang original artwork that will transport them back to this special day whenever they look at it.“We booked Jane shortly before our wedding, and I couldn’t be happier that we did. I’d been interested in incorporating live painting into our wedding for a while but struggled to find someone available and within our budget. On my MIL's recommendation, I decided to take another look—and I’m so glad I found Jane. Having her live paint at our wedding was an incredible experience. Our guests were captivated as they watched her create during the ceremony and throughout the evening. As it turned out, we had a lot in common personally and creatively—she’s also planning her own wedding—which made working together feel serendipitous. From our first conversation to meeting her in person on our wedding day, everything just clicked. Jane completed the painting so quickly! Due to our honeymoon, we didn’t get to see it in person until about a month after the wedding, but it was well worth the wait. The painting is stunning and now hangs across from our bed, where it serves as a daily reminder of our special day. Jane is incredibly creative and collaborative. Also, she traveled from NY to Northern Virginia for the day! She even offered great advice on sizing and framing, helping us choose the perfect option for our space. The live painting experience was truly one-of-a-kind, but I’d absolutely work with her again on other projects, like her beautiful pet or architectural paintings.”Rachel, 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/c86e8e33-d2a8-4cc2-a459-eeffc8221226?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/dejane-jane-de-art)
