  * ### Wedding photos made simple

•Verified review

•Kristi F.•Oct 22, 2025

Working with Mind Of Mo Weddings & Events for our wedding was a fantastic experience. They were incredibly responsive to our needs and questions throughout the planning process. The quality of their work was excellent, especially given the great price they charged. They made our wedding day fun and comfortable, even when they were holding a camera right in our faces. We actually added videography just 2 days before the wedding, and they were able to accommodate that last-minute request seamlessly. I would highly recommend Mind Of Mo Weddings & Events to any couple looking for a talented and professional photography team for their special day.

•Tara M.•Oct 10, 2025

Allie was our photographer for the day and she did absolutely amazing. She fit right in with my family and friends, and guests thought Allie and I were long time friends. With our wedding being a bit unique with timing and events, Allie did not hesitate to give direction, help where needed, and kept me cool calm and collected. She even jumped in the bounce house with us, truly going above and beyond! The sneak peeks of the photos were breathtaking and brilliant. She did a marvelous job of capturing the moments, stolen kisses, and my loud eccentric faces.

## Frequently asked questions

10 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Because we have a team of experienced photographers to choose from, availability is not typically an issue for us - however we do have dates that will book out completely! We recommend booking at least 8 months in advance, or 12 months if there is a specific photographer you want to work with.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Yes! Because we are a team, we are able to guarantee the option for a second photographer, for couples desiring two shooters. A second photographer can be added to any wedding package, and is included in our Platinum Investment. Our photographers work with each other every weekend and shoot exclusively for Mind of Mo Photography, meaning we aren't just recruiting someone from an online pool.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Yes and no. We start by culling your album, meaning we go through and eliminate any duplicates, or photos that are not worth keeping (like those with closed eyes or blur). We keep and edit at least one version of every photo we take, but make sure you get the best of the best! You will receive every photo in both color and black and white.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, we believe that vendors perform best when they can focus on one specific goal - and for us, that's photography! We do however have a list of videographers who we work with often and are very confident in recommending! We strongly avoid booking companies who offer more than one service (as we have learned that a Jack of All trades is most often an Expert of None)

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

We know that the anticipation is real when it comes to seeing those wedding photos! We deliver "sneak peeks" (25-50 images) within one week of your wedding, typically 2-3 days after the big day. We guarantee all final images within 10 weeks of your wedding, but average closer to 6-8 week turnaround when not in busy season.

### How many pictures will we get?

While this answer varies depending on which package you book, we do not limit how many final images our couples receive - we keep and edit everything worth sending. On average, our "all day" (8-9 hour) weddings typically receive anywhere from 600-800+ final images. We also send all images in both color & black and white.

### Do you have insurance?

We do! Our Certificate of Liability is available for any venue or vendor that needs a copy.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

We are extremely lucky to have the team that we do, and pride ourselves on the fact that we have NEVER missed a wedding, even through COVID! In the highly unlikely event that your chosen photographer is unable to shoot your wedding, you will be given the option to choose a replacement from our team.

### Do I know which photographer I'll be working with?

Absolutely! Our couples choose which photographer they'd like to work with for their wedding day, and they'll work with the same photographer for both wedding + engagement photos (if both services are booked). All of our couples will also work with our owner Maurissa, who handles the contracts + bookings, as well as all of the editing for the company.

### Is there any sort of perk for booking through Zola?

Yes! Couples who find us on Zola receive a $200 discount on any wedding package we offer.
