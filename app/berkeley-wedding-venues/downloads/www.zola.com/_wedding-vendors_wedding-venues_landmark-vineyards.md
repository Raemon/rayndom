  * ### Wonderful Venue in Wine Country

•Verified review

•Jay T.•Jan 5, 2025

My wife and I held our wedding at Landmark in August 2024. Olivia was great to work with and the wedding itself was perfect and went off without a hitch. We loved the landscaping and ambiance of the venue, with its views of vineyards overlooking the Mayacamas, which provided the perfect backdrop for our 50 person ceremony. The beautiful flowers and outdoor furniture also helped us save a bit on other parts of our budget -- the space is so nice that it doesn't need too much done to it. We also liked the cottage and suite onsite, which are a nice perk. Landmark is definitely worth visiting if you are looking for a fantastic wine country venue!

  * ### The Perfect Wedding Venue!!!

•Verified review

•Maddie L.•May 28, 2023

I can't speak highly enough of Landmark Vineyards! From the moment we set foot on the premises, we knew we had discovered the perfect place to celebrate our special day. The staff at the venue were exceptional - professional, accommodating, attentive, and they made us feel like part of their family. Olivia, in particular, went above and beyond to ensure that every detail was meticulously taken care of. Her expertise and experience shone through from our initial discussions all the way to the flawless execution of the event. The venue itself was absolutely breathtaking. The majestic Sugar Loaf Mountains served as a picturesque backdrop for our ceremony and reception. Our guests were captivated by the beauty and charm of the venue, and we received countless compliments on our choice of location. Not to mention, the wine was absolutely delicious! I can't express enough how much I recommend Landmark Vineyards. I look forward to returning to celebrate anniversaries and other special occasions in the future. This place holds a special place in our hearts, and we will never stop singing its praises.
