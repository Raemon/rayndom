At By Grace Wedding Co., I Nicole Patterson specialize in creating weddings that are as seamless as they are beautiful. Based in Northern California, I offer full-service planning, month-of coordination, and customizable packages tailored to each couple’s unique needs. I bring a love for design, organization, and thoughtful details, paired with a genuine heart for serving couples during such a meaningful season. From vision boards and color palettes to vendor coordination, timelines, and day-of logistics, I’m here to ensure every detail reflects your love story.

What sets me apart is the personal approach I bring to every wedding. I don’t just plan events, I partner with my couples, guiding them with care, intention, and expertise throughout the planning process. With a keen eye for design and a deep love for organization, I focus on every detail so you can feel supported, present, and confident. From vision boards and color palettes to vendor coordination and day-of execution, my goal is a wedding that feels stress-free, meaningful, and unforgettable.

  * ### What a great planner!

•Verified review

•Joe•Jan 18

Nicole was so help for my wedding. She got along great with my wife and made it so much easier. She helped us find answers to question we had and didn’t know about! I recommend her services to anyone looking for help with their wedding day.

  * ### Professional, Organized, and a Joy to Work With

•Verified review

•Kenzie B.•Jan 18

I had the pleasure of working with Nicole in a professional capacity as the content creator for both her bridal shower and wedding day, and the experience was nothing short of exceptional. Even while being the bride, Nicole approached every interaction with professionalism, clarity, and genuine kindness. All qualities that speak volumes about how she would serve her clients. As a wedding planner herself who planned her own wedding, she was incredibly organized, communicative, and respectful of myself and all of the vendor teams, which allowed the day to run smoothly and seamlessly. She trusted the creative process, valued collaboration, and created such a positive environment to work in, something I really appreciated. Having now worked with Nicole on multiple occasions, I can confidently say she brings the same level of care, attention to detail, and thoughtfulness to her business, By Grace Wedding Co., as she did to her own events. Any couple looking for a planner who is both experienced and deeply invested in their day would be in amazing hands with her.

By Grace Wedding Co. was a fantastic wedding planner for our big day. Their communication throughout the planning process was great - they were always responsive to our questions and kept us informed every step of the way. The quality of their work and the value they provided was top-notch. They were willing to work within our budget and found creative ways to elevate our event without breaking the bank. From the beautiful floral arrangements to the seamless timeline, By Grace Wedding Co. helped make our wedding truly special. I highly recommend them to any couple planning their dream day.

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### Describe your experience. How many weddings have you planned, and what are they like? Any specialties?

I officially launched By Grace Wedding Co. in 2025, but my experience goes back several years. I’ve been deeply involved in planning multiple weddings prior to launching my business, including my own wedding, which I planned in just four months. I specialize in thoughtfully organized, detail-driven weddings that feel personal, seamless, and meaningful. My focus is on creating a calm planning experience while bringing each couple’s vision to life.

### Are you part of a team? Who will we be working with?

I’m the owner and lead planner of By Grace Wedding Co., so you’ll be working directly with me throughout the entire planning process. I intentionally keep my business personal so couples feel fully supported and confident knowing exactly who is handling their wedding. If additional support is needed on the wedding day, I bring in trusted assistants to ensure everything runs smoothly.

### Do you also plan other events, like bridal showers or rehearsal dinners?

Yes! In addition to wedding day planning, I’m happy to assist with events such as engagement parties, bridal showers, rehearsal dinners, and welcome events. These can be added on depending on your planning package and needs. My goal is to make the entire wedding season feel cohesive, organized, and stress-free.

### How much time should we expect to spend with you?

The amount of time we spend together depends on the level of planning support you choose. I’m always intentional about communication and provide guidance, check-ins, and support at each stage of planning. My goal is to be available when you need me while keeping the process efficient, organized, and enjoyable.

### Do you take on multiple weddings in a day or weekend?

No — I intentionally limit the number of weddings I take on so each couple receives my full attention and care. I only commit to one wedding per day, ensuring I’m fully present, focused, and available to support you and your vendors from start to finish.
