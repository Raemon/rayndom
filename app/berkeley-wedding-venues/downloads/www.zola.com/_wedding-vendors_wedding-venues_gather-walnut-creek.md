  * ### Such a Great Venue! 

•Verified review•Incentivized review

•Amelia•Jun 30, 2025

Gather Walnut Creek was the perfect venue for our welcome party. The team was so friendly and quick to respond. They were organized and flexible when the plan changed. We're so grateful to the Gather team for helping make our wedding festivities so special and memorable.

  * ### Cute space, poorly managed 

•Verified review

•Maggie•Jun 4, 2024

I booked this venue for my wedding reception in June with high hopes, it's very cute and the space seemed like perfect size for our small party. When we went to tour the venue, Ashlyn, was very helpful, answered all our questions and made us feel like herself and the owners, David & Maritza, would be there to guide us through planning the entire event. We were sold this as an event space WITH the availability of using Maritza as a party planner. Immediately following our deposit, there was no communication from Maritza despite me reaching out multiple times to ask for advice and questions about the venue. Eventually I started to book things on my own-despite being told the venue would help with all of this. Over the course of two months I sent multiple emails to David and called multiple times with questions about my event, but did not hear back until about two weeks before my event when we ended up having to cancel. Upon telling David that we wanted to cancel and requesting a refund, he claimed that Maritza's services are not included or not tied to the venue in any way despite being told by their employee multiple times that they were, and because of this he is unable to refund us. David took no responsibility for the business he and his wife run and left my husband and I looking for a better place two weeks before our event. Be cautious before booking this venue.
