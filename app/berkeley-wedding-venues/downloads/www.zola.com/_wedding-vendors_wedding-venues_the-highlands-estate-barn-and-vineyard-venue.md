## About this venue

The Highlands Estate is a beautiful and private wedding destination located in Northern California’s wine country. Flexible options include traditional one-day celebrations and, when Two-Day and Weekend Buyouts are reserved, lodging for up to fourteen guests is included. Completely private and situated on over 21 country acres, the picturesque grounds offer a multitude of vistas and photo opportunities including acres of Syrah vineyards, iconic oak trees, rolling hills, a tranquil pond and incredible rock formations.

Located in the Yorkville Highlands Valley and surrounded by the Alexander and Anderson Valleys, The Highlands Estate is easily accessed within minutes from towns just to the South including Cloverdale, Geyserville and Healdsburg, from the East including Boonville and Philo and from the North including Hopland and Ukiah.

## Our event spaces

### The Property

The elevation and positioning of the property provide the perfect setting for weddings, reunions, vow renewals, or just about any kind of private event.

Set at a high elevation, The Estate overlooks the majestic hills and vineyards of the Yorkville Highlands Valley. From nearly every vantage point on the property there are miles of unobstructed and differing views to the beautiful rural countryside surrounding the property. Situated on the southwestern portion of the property is the Farmhouse-style Victorian Estate. An old-growth oak tree surrounded by the upper vineyard that overlooks the Estate and valleys beyond. Leading up to the Estate and dividing the upper and lower Syrah vineyards is the driveway lined by plum trees. Moving further east from the Estate is the pond. Should guests self-drive, your guests are picked up by our included eco-friendly electric shuttle and transported directly to the ceremony site. There are never any great distances for your guests to walk, regardless if they drive themselves or come on a bus. On the southeastern portion of the property is the Four Seasons Barn, the adjoining Terrace and the ceremony area with the arbor.

#### Ideal for

Wedding ceremony, Wedding reception, Wedding shower, Farewell brunch, Couples luncheon, Cocktail hour, After party, Elopement, Other

#### Guests often feel this space is

“Beautifully rustic”

#### Included in this room:

Should there be handicap guests, there’s handicap parking right at the Four Seasons Barn, along with VIP parking spaces for the couple, wedding party or other designated persons. A separate, hidden vendor parking lot allows convenient access to the Four Seasons Barn while not taking any guest parking spaces.

### The Four Seasons Barn

The separate, yet connected spaces of ceremony area, terrace, barn and breezeway deliver multiple opportunities and flexibility to create the perfect atmosphere and experience for your guests.

Shaded by old-growth oak trees from the afternoon sun, guests will enjoy seeing the couple framed by the arbor and set against the breathtaking and unobstructed views of vineyards and hills beyond. The grand steps from the Terrace down to the ceremony area provide an impressive entrance. The Four Seasons Barn is entered directly from the Terrace through ornate massive doors. Six dimmable wagon-wheel chandeliers with fairy-lights create a romantic and warm atmosphere for all. Fully climate controlled, guests will be comfortable regardless of the temperature outside. As this is where the dancing takes place, an acoustically tuned sound system is in place, keeping the floor space clear of any speakers and providing immersive sound. Two sets of French doors on the south side lead to the covered but open-air area. With fans in place providing a refreshing breeze on warmer days, the area is used for everything from cocktail hour to a relaxed and quieter space to a place for “the guys” to hang out.

#### Guest capacity

Up to 200 Seated

#### Ideal for

Wedding ceremony, Wedding reception, Wedding shower, Farewell brunch, Cocktail hour, Other

#### Guests often feel this space is

“Magical”

#### Included in this room:

-To ensure that the view isn’t compromised by speakers that might obscure the view and that all guests can hear, the ceremony area is surrounded by hidden rock-speakers. -Whether dining inside or out on the Terrace, twelve oversize and hand-crafted (by Gard) farm tables are included as well as five round tables and comfortable wood chairs for seating up to 150 guests; additional tables and seating may be rented though a variety of vendors.
