I am a fine art wedding photographer base in the Bay Area San Francisco, CA. I take pride on crafting timeless, exquisite imagery and story that you will cherish forever. I strive to capture the happy moments, not just an image. You only get one chance to capture those moments and I'll make sure you get it

For me, every loving tale should be detailed, funfilled, emotion-packed, and relaxed. When I look through that lens, I aim to capture a look, a smile, a touch, an emotion - this translates through to the photos that you take home. I strive to capture the happy moments, not just an image. You only get one chance to capture the moment and I'll make sure you get it. Capturing memories between the “will you marry me” phase of a relationship to the “I do” moment gives me so much satisfaction that I feel guilty even calling it 'work.' I like to create happy, candid memories that will last forever.

  * ### The best photographer you could ask for

•Verified review

•Jasmine A.•Sep 25, 2024

Arjay is an amazing photographer, and there's a reason he gets 5 stars! Because of Arjay's incredible portfolio and his outstanding work on our friend's wedding photos, we had already decided that we wanted him to be our wedding photographer. The fact that he was free on our wedding date made us very happy! We got married at the San Francisco City Hall and although we worked with him for a couple hours, he made us feel at ease and made the entire process enjoyable. We value his guidance for our photos as well as his humor and positive attitude! When we received our pictures, it was tough to choose a favorite because all of them are so beautiful! Arjay is a gifted photographer with his creativity, attention to detail and ability to capture those special moments. Look no further! He is the perfect photographer to capture those moments you want to remember forever. Thank you, Arjay! We can't wait to work with you again in the future!

We highly recommend Arjay Moreno Photography to any couple looking for a trustworthy and talented wedding photographer.

From the first moment we spoke with Arjay, we were impressed by his prompt, fast, and incredibly helpful response. Arjay and his team were a dream to work with - they made us feel completely stress-free on our wedding day and their amazing, above and beyond work resulted in stunning, natural photos that we'll treasure forever. Arjay is so knowledgeable and talented, and he captured so many beautiful moments that truly showcase Me and my husband. All of our families commented on how friendly, fun and professional Arjay was throughout the day. We couldn't be happier with the incredible value and quality Arjay provided, and we highly recommend him to any couple looking for an amazing photographer.

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### How Many Photos Are Typically Included and Can We Print the Photos Ourselves?

Galleries typically include anywhere between 600 and 1,000 photos. The exact amount varies from wedding to wedding. Your online gallery will come loaded with fully edited high resolution images you can print anywhere.

### When Do You Charge Travel Fees?

We add travel fees on to any wedding that are outside an hour of driving away from San Francisco, CA

### Do You Touch Up All the Images in Our Image Gallery?

Yes we do. Every image we deliver is post processed with our unique signature style. This involves color correction, exposure adjustment, selective black and white processing, clarity adjustments, tone-mapping, and other corrections.

### My Venue Is Very Dark. How Does Your Studio Handle These Situations and Can I See Samples?

We have shot in the darkest of dark chapels and reception halls so no need to worry! If the situation allows, we will set up additional lighting to ensure we get focused pictures. Some chapels do not allow for flash photography; and for that reason, we shoot on camera’s with superb low-light performance and lenses with low apertures letting us capture even on the darkest area.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Once you know your wedding date, we recommend reaching out as soon as possible about our availability. We photograph a limited number of weddings every year to ensure our couples receive the highest quality service, so our calendar typically fills up months in advance.

### Do you also offer video services?

I do not but I do have a great list of amazing videographers I have professionally worked with for years that I highly recommend to all my couples
