Hello! Hi! It's so nice to meet you. My name is Hilary! I am a Professional Photographer and Super 8 Videographer based in Southern Maine specializing in Elopements, Weddings, Families, Lifestyles, and more. After attending college in Boston for photography, I found myself shooting weddings for friends and have built my casual endeavor into a beautiful, fun business. Since then, I have expanded into Super 8 and film photography focusing on commercial and lifestyle family sessions.

If you're looking for someone to effortlessly and candidly capture you, your friends, and your family...I'm your gal! My approach is very calm and easy-going. I walk into every shoot with the intention of making my subjects as comfortable as they can be. I offer a free engagement shoot in either digital or film. I find this time to be the perfect opportunity for you and me to get to know each other a little better. This way, you're much less nervous to be photographed leading up to your big day.

•Abigail H.•Nov 1, 2024

This is your sign to hire Hilary as your wedding photographer. I cannot speak highly enough of her and her work. Hilary captured the MOST gorgeous photos on our wedding day and for our engagement session. She was incredibly communicative and helpful throughout the whole process. Our guests loved her and so did we! Hilary is the best!!

  * ### Hilary is incredible!

•Verified review

•Kristen N.•Oct 2, 2023

Hilary is awesome - so wonderful to work with, super responsive, really accommodating, her whole vibe and style is exactly what we wanted and all the photos so far have been amazing! She helped make me and my partner feel comfortable and was so much fun. 100000% recommend

  * ### A photographer who sees you

•Verified review

•Mary + B.•Sep 28, 2021

Hilary has a way of quietly capturing the magic in the milestones and the ordinary moments - at weddings and beyond. Every single photo she delivers tells a story of its own, and every time I look back through our images, I notice something new. It's a beautiful thing to witness an artist in action, and to frame her work on your wall later. I recommend Hilary to everyone! For documenting all of life's big stuff and everything in between.

  * ### A fantastic photographer!

•Verified review

•Sydney Bilodeau•Sep 28, 2021

Hilary is incredible. My husband and I eloped so most of our wedding day was spent with just us and Hilary. She is easy going, incredibly professional, and has the most amazing photographic eye. Hire her! She captures the feeling of your day with ease, and looking back on our photos feels like we are there over and over again. She’s easy going all while still catching every moment. I recommend Hilary up and down and hope that you choose her for your day!
