  * ### Beautiful sunsets and views

•Verified review

•Monica T.•Nov 8, 2025

This venue was amazing for our wedding! We loved working with the staff to help coordinate our day and the wine was delicious (there is a case minimum purchase per person). There are 4 different rooms/areas to host guests which perfectly holds 100-120 people. The dining space is nicely lit and vibey. Our 1 negative is the ceremony start time had to be after 5:30pm once their tasting room closed, which was difficult for a fall wedding. The sun set quickly on us, but was fine since our ceremony was only 30 minutes. Just something to note if you plan to get married in October. This venue ends at 11pm with the option to extend an hour, which we didnt find at many other wineries!

  * ### They won best venue in Sonoma for a reason!

•Verified review

•Shelby L.•Oct 28, 2024

Paradise Ridge was absolutely stunning for our wedding! Even though it rained all day unexpectedly, the venue was just breathtaking. The only thing I would definitely change is that they have ceremonies start at 6pm and receptions end at 11pm- I wish we would've either added the optional hour to go to midnight or rented the space out to start earlier since everyone was having a ton of fun and it felt like the dancing didn't last as long as some other weddings we've been to. The staff was professional and knowledgable, and we didn't have any problems day of. They also have chairs and tables for 150 people included, which was great when making the rental order. Overall, PRW was fantastic.

  * ### Your guests will say: "This is flippin' stunning!"

•Verified review

•Marie and D.•Jul 28, 2023

We could not recommend Paradise Ridge Winery as your wedding venue enough! Both because of the beauty of the venue/vineyard itself and the friendliness and professionalism of the team. The venue is stunningly located on the top of a ridge, so you and your guests will have unparalleled views of the vineyards and greater Santa Rosa all night long. You can watch the beautiful sunset behind the famous Love statue while you say your vows and your guests enjoy their post-ceremony wine. I had to pinch myself at one moment that this is where we were getting married! The venue also is flexible and unique in that you can have a separate space for all the major events - outdoor welcome space, ceremony outside, balcony for drinks/appetizers, upstairs indoor/outdoor dining for dinner, and then downstairs for dancing and outdoor hanging (alongside fire pits and a brick oven perfect for late night pizza!). It made the whole night feel like a fun surprise as we transitioned into different spots. The Paradise Ridge team also is phenomenal. The team quickly got to know us as we visited prior to the wedding and we got on first name bases with the majority of team members. I also was so grateful for how hospitable they were to my Mom when she visited prior to the wedding. She had mobility issues and they made sure she was enjoying herself and taken care of. We also joined the wine club and still head back regularly for visits. Not just because the wine is delicious, but because the team has felt like family. It's become our favorite place to celebrate special occasions. On a few practical notes that also influenced us on selecting Paradise Ridge: While you can lean into a beautiful outdoor wedding, you also have indoor space as a back-up and beautiful dining chairs for no extra charge. And because the building is also brand new, it's clean, modern, and ADA accessible - perfect for members of your family with mobility issues! Last but not least, it's more centrally located in Santa Rosa so if transportation is not in your budget, you don't have to sweat being able to get to/from the venue through Lyft/Uber/cabs. Thank you, Paradise Ridge, for being the wedding venue of our dreams. You are very special to us, and we know you'll continue to help other couples celebrate and share such unbelievable memories.
