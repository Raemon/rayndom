Brandon Garner is a wedding photographer creating timeless, elevated imagery for couples who value refined storytelling and authentic emotion. With a cinematic, editorial approach, he captures weddings in a way that feels intentional yet effortless—preserving elegant details and meaningful moments as they naturally unfold. Known for his calm presence and attention to detail, Brandon delivers a discreet, luxury experience and imagery designed to stand the test of time. Based in the Midwest and available for travel.

I'm easy to get along with and with my experience shooting large events I know how to "stay out of the way". I pride myself in not being a distraction to your big day but still capturing all of the images for a perfect wedding album that you will enjoy for years to come.

## Frequently asked questions

8 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 6 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Sometimes, I’ll bring one or more assistant photographers depending on the size of your wedding. Don’t worry, this won’t cost you extra.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, I prefer focusing on photography only, so you can get the best wedding pictures possible.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 7 days after your big day. You will receive an e-mail with a link to download and also view your own personal online gallery. From the gallery you are also able to order any prints you would like!

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 12 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.
