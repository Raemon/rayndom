•Verified review

•Kaitlyn J.•Dec 27, 2024

Greg, Laurie and their staff (Racheal) are a pleasure to work with. So helpful and attentive to all our needs. My husband and I just had our wedding there and my I constantly tell people that it was a magical fairytale. From the fantastic scenery, lovely stream, and great weather...we couldn't have asked for a better day. All the guests had a good time and loved the camping!

Roses & Acorns Creekside Weddings @ Camp Nauvoo provided an exceptional experience for our wedding day. From the open and personal communication style of Laurie and Greg, to the affordable and well-maintained venue, they went above and beyond to make our day special. They were extremely personalized and accommodating, ensuring every detail was taken care of. Laurie and Greg were amazing to work with, and we couldn't have asked for a better wedding venue. We highly recommend Roses & Acorns Creekside Weddings @ Camp Nauvoo to any couple looking for a beautiful and affordable wedding experience.

•Verified review

•Brooke•Dec 11, 2024

We loved having our wedding @ Camp Nauvoo. We live outside the country so I wanted a place that could provide chairs, tables and a majority of the decor.(the owners have a lot of wedding stuff you can use!) I also wanted to be able to stay there and to be able to give those who flew in from around the world a place to stay as well. It worked out perfectly! 120 guests, with 38 choosing to stay on site. Those who flew from far away stayed in the glamping sites and those who lived in town brought their own supplies and camped. We also used their recommendation for dinner - fantastic Mexican food. 10/10 would recommend, would use again but hopefully I'm only getting married once, maybe a family reunion next time.

Brooke thank you so much for taking the time to provide a review.

  * ### Absolutely Wonderful Wedding Experience

•Verified review

•Yana Z.•Feb 5, 2022

In 2021, I organized, planned, and coordinated my parents wedding with Roses & Acorns Creekside Weddings. The experience was fantastic from start to finish. The grounds are beautifully maintained, the information provided was clear and transparent, and the day was as magical as we had hoped. Greg and Laurie communicated effectively and quickly, supported many of our ideas and plans, and Greg was a compassionate and engaging officiant the day of the wedding. He took all of our ideas and suggestions to heart and made the day memorable. Greg and Laurie and other staff were gracious and supportive hosts and we couldn't have asked for anything more. It felt like we have known Greg for years, we were treated like family, and the setting and experience were exactly what my parents' were looking for. Friends and family gushed about the wedding and we wholeheartedly recommend the venue for anyone's special day!

Response from vendor•Dec 12, 2024

Yana your parents will be part of our family forever. Thank you for taking the time to provide a review.
