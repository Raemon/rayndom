  * ### Amazing venue

•Verified review

•Mackenzie H.•Nov 19, 2025

Lone Wulff Ranch was the perfect venue for our wedding. Their communication was easy and quick, which made planning a breeze. The quality of their work and the value they provided was top-notch - the property was clean, country, and absolutely beautiful. We loved that the venue itself served as the best decor we could have asked for, with a stunning natural landscape. Staying onsite was an added bonus that allowed us to fully immerse ourselves in our special day. We couldn't have asked for a better wedding venue.

  * ### October 2025 Wedding

•Verified review

•Leigh J.•Nov 17, 2025

Rachel and the Lone Wulff Ranch were an absolute dream for our wedding day. We were specifically looking for a venue where we weren't locked into catering contracts and could have food that fit us best and we quickly found The Lone Wulff Ranch. Immediately upon pulling onto the property for a tour I was pretty confident we were going to book. It has the perfect rustic ranch feel with so many options for your day. The oak tree is magical, the goats add such a fun touch, noodle and the rest of the characters on the ranch just added even more to the experience. In planning the big day Rachel was extremely prompt and professional. She has seen A LOT and she knows what to prepare you for. Her vendor list is top tier, but she lets you book outside of her list if you want which is nice if you want the flexibility. The staff on site during the wedding is amazing. Everyone is all in on you having a magical day and it really shows. The only issue (that I know of, at least) on our wedding day was that the bathroom generator ran out of gas, but Rachel was immediately on it and refilled it in a matter of minutes. This venue has SO MUCH to offer. If it fits your vision, book it. There is so much customization on this property, they have a prop den if you want to keep it easy. We got so many compliments on the venue and how balanced it is for guests. It gives you separate ceremony and reception space all on one property allowing for a seamless experience for everyone. The barn critters were such a fun addition for us, but Rachel also was extremely mindful that they were part of our vision for the day. I will always sing the praises of Rachel and this venue, absolutely would recommend.

  * ### Excellent Barn Chic Venue

•Verified review

•Juliet S.•Sep 15, 2025

Lone Wulff Ranch was the perfect venue for our daughter's bat mitzvah. Rachel, the event coordinator, was clear and timely with her communication, which made the planning process smooth and stress-free. The venue had beautiful outdoor space and a picturesque setting for photographs. Rachel went out of her way to ensure all the vendors had everything they needed and that information was clearly communicated. She went above and beyond to make sure everything was prepared for and anticipated any needs we had. Our celebration day was truly magical thanks to the wonderful team at Lone Wulff Ranch.

Response from vendor•Nov 4, 2025

Juliet, It was so much fun to host your daughter's special day. What a joy to see her joy! I hope we can work together again in the future! Thank you so much! RACHEL WULFF

  * ### Wonderful venue!

•Verified review

•Mira & C.•May 25, 2025

My husband and I had the best experience getting married at Lone Wulff Ranch, and would strongly recommend this venue to other couples! The Ranch itself is stunning from every angle, and really feels like a magical place to be married. We had our rehearsal dinner there on Friday night, and it was so special to spend the whole weekend at the Ranch and have time to enjoy the lovely property (this is super rare for wedding venues!). The owner, Rachel, was an absolute pleasure to work with. She offers a friendly, personal touch, and flexibility in customizing your wedding day that is truly unique! Throughout the entire process she was professional, organized, quick to respond, and incredibly helpful. We used all her preferred vendors and they did an amazing job. If you have the opportunity to be married here, do it!!

Response from vendor•Nov 4, 2025

Mira, I am looking at all your pictures and feeling so grateful for you both and your families. Blessings!
