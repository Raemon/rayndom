  * ### Amazing Help on Our Colorful Day

•Verified review

•Rick D.•Dec 28, 2025

Working with Sydney was such a great experience. She was so open to hearing about our (extensive) ideas and themes, all the miscellaneous thoughts we wanted to talk about, but then helping us understand what we could realistically do while staying true to our vision. Sydney was so on it, being detail oriented, keeping us on track, and helping us through achieving our milestones. Thank you so much, Sydney for all you did to make our special day one we'll never forget!

  * ### Sydney is amazing!

•Verified review

•Violet•Nov 26, 2025

Sydney brought such a calming, confident energy to the wedding day! She kept everything organized, on time, and flowing so naturally that it felt effortless for everyone involved. She was incredibly attentive and quick-thinking, handling every little pivot and behind-the-scenes detail with ease, from coordinating décor setup and family florals to helping with the veil and bustle. Beyond her organization and professionalism, Sydney was genuinely kind and uplifting throughout the entire day, constantly hyping up the bride, offering reassurance, and creating such a positive, supportive atmosphere. As the Maid of Honor who helped with pre-planning, I was blown away by how smoothly everything ran under her care. Thanks to Sydney, we were all able to relax, be present, and just enjoy the day knowing everything was completely handled!

  * ### A Coordinator Who Makes Every Wedding Seamless

•Verified review

•Heather D.•Nov 26, 2025

Working with Sydney is always an absolute pleasure. As a wedding florist, I collaborate with many planners and coordinators, and she truly stands out. Her communication is clear, timely, and thoughtful — she makes sure every vendor has exactly what they need well in advance, which makes the entire wedding day flow effortlessly. Her attention to detail is incredible; she has a natural ability to keep the couple’s vision at the center while coordinating all the moving parts behind the scenes with grace and professionalism. On wedding days, she’s calm, organized, and solution-oriented — the kind of coordinator you’re genuinely grateful to have on site. Most importantly, she treats every vendor with respect and kindness. Her teamwork mindset and positive energy make the entire creative process better. I highly recommend Sydney to any couple looking for a coordinator who truly cares and to any vendor seeking a seamless, supportive working relationship. She is exceptional at what she does.

  * ### Sydney Paige is INCREDIBLE at her job

•Leah B.•Nov 17, 2025

I have had the pleasure of working with Sydney Paige to plan, coordinate and produce over 50 weddings. I have watched her pour her heart and soul into making sure all of her clients are heard, taken care and stress free. Sydney is incredibly kind, hard working, detail oriented and can turn any idea into reality. Anyone would be lucky to have her as part of their wedding day!

Response from vendor•Nov 17, 2025

This means everything coming from you. I’ve been so lucky to work alongside you for all these weddings and to have someone as talented, thoughtful, and inspiring in my corner. Thank you for always believing in me and for being the best teammate. I adore you!
