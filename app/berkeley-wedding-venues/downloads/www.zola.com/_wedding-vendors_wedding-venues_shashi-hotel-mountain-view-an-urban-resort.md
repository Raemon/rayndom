  * ### Not wedding-75th Birthday

•Verified review

•kennethpeters•Nov 13, 2024

Shashi Hotel Mountain View was the perfect venue for our wedding celebration! From the moment we met Madeline Villanueva, the wedding coordinator, we knew we were in great hands. Her warm and friendly communication style made us feel like we were planning a birthday party with a close friend, rather than a formal wedding. The hotel staff were incredibly accommodating and went out of their way to fulfill all of our requests, ensuring our special day was flawless. The food and service at Broma, the on-site restaurant, was excellent, though the bar drinks were quite expensive. Overall, the value was excellent - our guests raved about the friendly service and amazing hotel amenities. We are thrilled with our decision to host our wedding at Shashi Hotel Mountain View and highly recommend working with Madeline and her team!

  * ### March 2024 University Room Block

•Verified review

•Bogda S.•Apr 3, 2024

In March 2024 our university booked a block of rooms at Shashi Hotel, Mountain View, CA. From the initial contact to the final good byes we received beyond excellent customer service! I was working with Madeleine Villanueva, Sales Manager for the hotel. Madeleine’s attention to detail, professionalism, friendliness, and assistance on every possible detail and request were outstanding. The hotel and restaurant welcomed us with customized welcome signs. The rooms were spotless clean and beds were super comfortable. Reception staff was fast to response, helpful and accommodating. The restaurant on site matched the hotel qualities. The food and the service was amazing! Overall, we had an awesome experience and looking forward to return to Shashi! I recommend both, the hotel and the restaurants to anyone visiting Bay Area.

  * ### Great location & price for a Winchester wedding

•Verified review

•Oct 2023_Wedding R.•Apr 2, 2024

Took a few emails to find the right person to manage a block of rooms for my daughter's wedding, but once we hooked up with Madeleine, everything went smoothly. Madeleine answered all my questions via email and phone since I was halfway across the country trying to set this up. Location was convenient to Winchester Mystery House, where our wedding was held. Small shopping plaza across the highway from the hotel had eating and shopping options and the Plaza was just a few minutes away.
