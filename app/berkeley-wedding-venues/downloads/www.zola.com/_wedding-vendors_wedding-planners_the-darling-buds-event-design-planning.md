  * ### The Best Decision We Made

•Verified review

•Joy B.•Oct 12, 2025

We couldn't have asked for better wedding planners than Anna and Lucky! They are incredibly responsible, detail-oriented, and an absolute joy to work with. From the very beginning, they scheduled an initial meeting to understand our love story, our vision for the wedding, our budget, and to walk us through the services they offer at The Darling Buds. After that meeting, they sent over a detailed breakdown of their packages. After thoughtful consideration, we chose the Month-of Coordination package--and it was one of the best decisions we made! In addition to coordination, they helped us build a beautiful and affordable wedding website that included our love story, the wedding agenda, RSVP page, photo gallery, and a link to our registry. They also went above and beyond by helping us create a wedding invitation tailored for our international guests to assist with their visa applications--such a thoughtful touch. One month before the wedding, we had a comprehensive prep meeting to go through every detail of the big day. Anna and Lucky became our main point of contact for all vendor communication, which saved us so much time and stress. As first-time newlyweds, we felt incredibly supported--they thought of every little detail we might have missed. They were punctual and helpful at our rehearsal, offering invaluable tips for ceremony positioning, like where each person should stand and how to coordinate with photographers and videographers to ensure all the right moments were captured. On the wedding day itself, Anna and Lucky truly worked their magic-arranging outdoor dining tables, communicating seamlessly with vendors, and keeping us updated on the schedule to make sure everything went smoothly. We are beyond satisfied with the planning and execution of our wedding thanks to Anna and Lucky. My husband and I had a truly magical day, and we wholeheartedly recommend their services to anyone who is going to plan their wedding!

  * ### They are the best!

•Verified review

•Chloe R.•Oct 8, 2025

Anna and Lucky at Darling Buds are an incredible team. They led my husband and I through the entire planning process and were there for us throughout the big day. We had the best day of our lives at our wedding. People kept saying that I didn't seem stressed on the day of, and I said that it was true - I really wasn't stressed. Anna and Lucky planned the day incredibly well, and I was just so excited to marry my love. From the very beginning, they truly got to know us as a couple and asked great questions to find out exactly what kind of wedding we wanted. For us, this included a fusion of scottish and chinese traditions and some decor that incorporated our pets! They kept us on track with monthly meetings/powerpoints and stayed in touch via email between meetings. They kept within our budget and assembled a dream team of vendors. They worked very well with the team at our venue and with all of the vendors. Our family and friends also enjoyed meeting them and thought they did an amazing job. We cannot recommend The Darling Buds enough! They are both truly special and wonderful people with an amazing talent for planning weddings. We will be staying in touch with them because they are the best!
