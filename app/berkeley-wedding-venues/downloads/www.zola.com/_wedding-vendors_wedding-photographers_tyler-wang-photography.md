Hi, I'm Tyler a professional photographer based in the SF Bay Area. I've been shooting portraits since 2009, when I visited Tibet with my dad on my middle school graduation trip. Ever since then, I've loved taking photos of people. Over the years I've developed my own style of photography to convey the feeling of the moment into my photos. My goal is to always create images that will stand the test of time.

You'll look back on these photos in 10, 20, or 30+ years and you'll go "wow look at us back then, this photo really represents how I felt in that moment." No matter the package you book with me, I'll be shooting a mix of both film and digital. I find this combination to be the best of both worlds, as I shoot a lot of film for both my work and personal projects. Digital allows me to cover the portions that film just isn't the greatest at. I also specialize in large prints so after the wedding if you're looking to have a physical immortalization of your love on your walls, I would be more than happy to help.

  * ### Best photography

•Verified review

•Hanna F.•Nov 8, 2023

Tyler was truly a gift to have as part of our wedding. He very carefully, and effectively, cultivated perfect settings for photographs that didn’t feel cheesy. He really understood the importance of angles and worked hard to find each of our best. Really, so so many of his photographs ended up breathtaking. If I were to do it all over again, I would have Tyler by my side to document my momentous day!

  * ### Awesome Photog for Weddings, Portraits, Art Shots!

•Verified review

•Keidee+Bailey•Nov 1, 2023

Tyler was amazing to work with. He did our engagement shoot and helped out with video during our elopement. We felt at ease and he made us feel comfortable off the bat and our engagement photos came out really nicely despite my now husband and my awkwardness behind the camera. We definitely look forward to doing more shoots with him in future. Book him! He’s awesome!

Typically, couples book me about 6-12 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you also offer video services?

Yes, I work a some very talented videographers that specialize in weddings. They'll be shooting the footage on the day of, while I do the directing.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding. Within this time, you can also expect to receive a digital gallery with high-resolution image files, so you can share the photos with your loved ones and order prints.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

II’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Sometimes, I’ll bring one or more assistant photographers depending on the size of your wedding. Don’t worry, this won’t cost you extra.
