  * ### Wedding Reception & Signature Cocktails

•Verified review

•Shanequa & E.•Nov 4, 2025

We booked NightCap Mobile Bar for our wedding reception. From the beginning all the way to the day after, Fachón was an amazing vendor to work with. She made sure to ask questions that never even considered and with very little guidance, she captured the vibe we wanted for day. She was even able to secure toasting champagne a few days prior to the wedding as I had forgot we needed it lol All of my guests loved their drinks and left feeling amazing. We couldn’t have asked for a better bartender for our open bar wedding. Thank you Fachón and we will be booking for any future events.!!

  * ### Wedding Memories & Signature Cocktails 

•Verified review

•Gregory•Oct 25, 2025

We booked Nightcap Mobile Bar for our wedding and couldn’t have been happier! From the first email to the last pour, everything was seamless. The trailer looked stunning in our outdoor venue — elegant, modern, and such a vibe. The custom cocktails were delicious (everyone loved the signature ‘Bride’s Bliss’), and the bartenders kept the energy high all night. Truly an unforgettable experience that elevated our celebration!”
