“Hartley Farms was the perfect wedding venue for us! From the beginning, the team was very quick to respond to our questions and incredibly kind throughout the entire planning process. They offered so many great ideas and were so helpful with all the details, which really made our wedding day run smoothly. We loved how Barbara and her husband had all the little things covered, from creative decor suggestions to making sure our guests were well taken care of. People are still raving about how amazing our wedding was, and we couldn't agree more - Hartley Farms is a 100/100 in our book!”Courtney, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/c2a467ee-c2b1-4367-a6db-8ceaf0681be0?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/hartley-farms)

Built in 1902 by the renowned architect Bernard Maybeck in traditional Arts and Crafts style, it's designed to create a cozy, intimate feeling. The crowning glory of the club is the three-story Great Hall. With its vaulted ceiling, massive stone fireplace, and stained-glass windows featuring heraldic crests of the great universities of the world, it's reminiscent of many a European cathedral. Light from the floor-to-ceiling windows warms the redwood paneling and suffuses the Hall in a golden glow. Two charming smaller spaces are also available for functions. The Heyns and Seaborg rooms (named respectively after a chancellor and a distinguished University Nobel Laureate) both have French doors leading to a private outdoor area with a garden view. The Faculty Club has been serving its members and guests for over 100 years and will do everything possible to make your event successful and enjoyable.Why you'll love this venue

“(Review for catering/events/venue service) I don’t have enough great words for Nicole and her team at Berkeley City Club. I planned my wedding entirely “remotely” from out of state and Nicole was always ready to answer my millions of questions and make sure everything was being planned to perfection. I had actually never seen the hotel in person, and I must say the architecture, foliage, vibes, etc are better and MORE stunning in person than in photos. Truly a breathtaking venue that transports you with its historic arches, details, etc. Wedding food is often lackluster in my experience, but I was thoroughly impressed by all of the plated dinner dishes we were served. My salmon was perfectly cooked and guests complimented their meals as well. They were also able to accommodate all gluten free food as I have celiac disease, which was the cherry on top. Additionally, a special shout out to the staff who worked the event day-of. Everyone was kind with bright smiles, and treated me and everything/everyone else with care.”Mariana S., 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/berkeley-city-club)

“The Terrace Room was the perfect venue for our wedding day. From the very beginning, the staff, especially Candi and Bryon, were friendly, simple, quick, and incredibly helpful in planning our wedding all the way from Paris. They gave us great tips on vendors that really helped make our day magical. The venue itself is beautiful, with a lovely art deco style that felt elegant and unique. Our guests raved about the gorgeous space, the friendly staff (bar tenders, ...), and how well everything came together to make our wedding day truly perfect.

“We loved the idea of booking a reception venue that already had an incredible staff in-house. GAMH provided us with great care and kind but honest input every step of the way. The event coordinator (the fabulous Mandy!), audio, lighting, catering, servers, bar service, coat check…..was perfection because the team is their own and prideful for the space and its legendary music history. It was special to introduce so many out-of-town guests to this beautiful classic of a venue in the heart of our city and dance the night away.

“We hosted our wedding at the Presidio Officers' Club and had truly the most special, incredible day of our lives. It was clean, well-organized, with delicious food and friendly staff. Not to mention, the planning team at the Presidio, through Wedgewood Weddings, was truly best-in-class. Wedgewood prepared us so well, providing a planning binder and step-by-step instructions. They checked in with us multiple times, providing walk-throughs, and answering every question extremely promptly. We especially loved our planner and day-of coordinator, Christian, who went out of his way to make everything so seamless. Christian taught us how to do our ceremony, including little details such as hand placement, went out of his way to accommodate a creative painting engagement, and provided private time for us newlyweds. He was perfect! So grateful to this beautiful venue and our wonderful team.

Desde el primer día que fuimos a conocer las instalaciones, el señor Gary fue muy atento y respetuoso, contestó a todas nuestras dudas. Tal vez nuestro evento fue algo fuera de lo común, a diferencia de los eventos de boda que se organizan aquí, nosotros contratamos el granero para el 25 de Diciembre para celebrar los 15 años de mi hija , sabemos que son días festivos donde la gente está con su familia , más sin embargo recibimos todo su apoyo para que el evento se hiciera realidad en este día tan especial , puedo decirles que fue una experiencia maravillosa, fue en evento de ensueño y de igual manera nos hospedamos en la casa, donde realmente nos sentimos como en nuestro hogar , sinceramente todas las instalaciones estuvieron limpias en todo momento, Gary estuvo al pendiente de si necesitábamos algo y al igual si la empresa que contratamos para la planeación necesitaban apoyo. Quiero animar a todos los papás que deseen hacerle su quinceañera a su hija, que consideren contratar los servicios de Suisun Valley Inn, ya que harán que su hija viva una experiencia única y de ensueño, no se arrepentirán. Sr Gary agradezco todas sus atenciones y muy pronto estaremos trabajando con usted para los 15 años de mi otra hija… Bendiciones”Fabiola M., 22 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/0dbc73ce-706c-4f4e-8b41-7324823426c8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

“Having our wedding at The San Francisco Theological Seminary was one of the easiest and best decisions we made when planning for our wedding! As soon as we stepped foot on the campus, we knew it was the venue we’d been looking for. Working with the staff here (big thank you to Jeremiah Jenkins!!) was low stress and straightforward. Many other venues we looked at just didn’t feel right and felt overly complicated. The grounds were beautifully rich with history and architecture and more than we could have asked for in a wedding venue.”Heather H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/bb5b98cb-d8fa-4d6a-8fec-561973d2b369?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/university-of-redlands-marin-campus)

“A family of 40 friends and relatives celebrated the life of a beloved family member who passed. Finca Montara helped find a bi-lingual non-denominational pastor, and a harpist for uplifting music. The comfortable antique pews and chairs added a lovely ambiance. Afterwards, we adjourned to the house for a buffet, toasts to the departed, and family unity. Altogether a wonderful experience! Highly recommended for weddings and renewal of vows as well as commemorations.”Barbara K., 5 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/finca-montara)

“The Gables Wine Country Inn was the perfect venue for our wedding. It had an intimate vibe and had such a variety of beautiful atmospheric additions too such as: a charming historic barn, redwood trees, winery, and Victorian building in the backdrop, it couldn't have been better. Pam & Larry (the owners and managers of Gables Wine Country Inn) were so kind when we came to them for a last minute wedding and were so flexible and adaptable with the things we wanted for our wedding. They were extremely helpful in giving us our perfect day: the decor was gorgeous, the venue amazing, food & drink was the best and our guests had a great time too. It was a very easy planning process and they were very easy going about our wishes so I highly recommend this venue for a wedding, it was a wonderful experience and they couldn't have made the stress of planning a wedding any easier.

## About wedding venues in San Miguel, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530
  * 300 guests: $104,224



### Which California Venues Are Fully Accessible?

The Griffith House features wheelchair-accessible pathways throughout its Spanish-style grounds including the private ceremony lawn and separate preparation spaces for couples. You might also consider Holman Ranch Sunstone Winery and Villa del Sol d'Oro though you'll want to directly confirm their specific accessibility features when you visit. Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.

### Where Can You Find Exceptional Culinary Experiences in California?

La Valencia Hotel in La Jolla delivers impeccable service with menu options from lobster bisque to perfectly prepared steak. You'll love Vibiana in Los Angeles with its chef-driven menus served in a stunning restored cathedral setting. Rosewood Sand Hill in Menlo Park offers Michelin-star fine dining while Bali Hai Restaurant serves authentic Polynesian cuisine with breathtaking views overlooking San Diego Bay. California's culinary scene truly elevates the wedding experience.
