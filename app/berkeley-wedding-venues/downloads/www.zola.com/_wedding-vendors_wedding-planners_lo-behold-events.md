  * ### Lauren is the Best of the Best!

•Verified review

•Stef A.•Dec 27, 2024

Lauren is, without a doubt, the best event planner I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with. Her proactive approach, exceptional organizational skills, and meticulous attention to detail make her an invaluable asset to any host. At every stage—pre-event, during the event, and post-event—she effortlessly alleviates pressure, managing all behind-the-scenes details with such grace that you’re left blissfully unaware of any potential hiccups. Lauren’s unwavering support and ability to adapt make her an incredible partner in creating seamless events. I can’t recommend her highly enough and look forward to collaborating with her as often as possible!

## Frequently asked questions

2 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you also plan other events, like showers or rehearsal dinners?

Yes, we can plan it all! From engagement parties, bachelorettes and bachelor weekends, to showers and rehearsal dinners, we are here to help you with every step of your wedding journey.

### Do you take on multiple weddings in a day or weekend?

No, we believe your wedding deserves our full attention, energy, and creativity. By intentionally limiting the number of weddings we accept each year, we’re able to: • Provide highly personalized service — you’re never just a date on our calendar. • Immerse ourselves in the details to craft unique, thoughtful experiences that reflect you. • Be fully present and available throughout the planning journey and on your wedding day. Our goal is to ensure every couple feels supported, stress‑free, and celebrated — and limiting our calendar allows us to deliver that level of care and creativity every single time.
