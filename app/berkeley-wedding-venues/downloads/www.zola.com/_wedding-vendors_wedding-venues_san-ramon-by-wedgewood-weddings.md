  * ### Magical Experience made by Wedgewood!

•Verified review

•Kimberly S.•Mar 2, 2025

From the moment we booked our wedding at San Ramon Waters By Wedgewood Weddings, their communication was timely, thorough, and wonderful. The venue and staff provided the highest quality, elegant experience, and truly gave us the best value for our special day. The Wedgewood team made every moment of our wedding magical, and every staff member was so kind and attentive. The vendors that are paired with San Ramon Wedgewood are top tier! Wedgewood truly made all of our wedding visions come true, and we are forever grateful for the amazing service and beautiful venue they provided.

  * ### Guest- art show

•Verified review

•Joy D.•Feb 6, 2025

I was very pleased with the whole process from organizing the event to the day of the event itself. I had an art gallery show and celebration of living. The staff was quick to reply to my emails and generous with their support. The day of the art exhibit the staff was helpful and kind. They kept an eye on me better than my own family, bringing me food and drinks. The food was good and I had 7 passed appetizers and a prime rib carving station. I was so happy and impressed with my choice of venue.

  * ### Bride 

•Verified review

•Gabriella G.•Jan 3, 2025

San Ramon Waters By Wedgewood Weddings was a stunning venue for our wedding, but we did experience some minor communication issues that caused a bit of stress at the start of the day. The space itself was truly breathtaking, with its amazing new upgrades and beautiful views. However, there were a few details that weren't properly communicated to us, which led to a bit of a rocky start. Although my bridal party and I had lots to deal with prior to ceremony start, these issues were not something our guests would have seen/noticed. To their credit, the Wedgewood team acknowledged their mistakes and upgraded our bar package to make up for it. Overall, the venue was beautiful and the staff did their best to ensure our day went smoothly, despite the initial hiccups. We would recommend San Ramon Waters to other couples looking for a gorgeous wedding location.
