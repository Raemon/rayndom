  * Serves Sunnyvale, CA

I started shooting photos and video in Greece, and since moving to the US, I have dedicated myself to shooting weddings, elopements and engagements. I love being able to capture the love that my couples have for each other and the unique energy each couple has. I am always down to shoot in new locations and find the best place for my shoots!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From the very first phone call, Enea set the tone for everything that followed. We’re not “picture people” at all, so the idea of an engagement shoot at San Francisco City Hall had us both quietly panicking. Enea’s warmth, humor, and genuine conversation melted every ounce of awkwardness away. We laughed more than we posed, and somehow walked out with **stunning, frame-worthy shots** that still make us grin. My husband loved them so much he had them printed and sewn onto the lining of the vest he wore on our wedding day – talk about a keepsake! Come the wedding day, Te Dua’s team was a dream. We got all the classic staged portraits we wanted, but what stole our hearts were the candid, in-the-moment captures: friends tearing up the dance floor, champagne toasts mid-laugh, family members just having a good time every second of joy preserved forever. And then there’s Luke, the videographer – wow. The highlight film he delivered is straight out of a Hollywood romance. The editing, the music, the pacing… it’s an emotional roller-coaster that replays the entire day in under ten minutes. I’ve watched it on repeat and cry every single time. Turnaround wasn’t instant, but every second of the wait was worth it. The quality, care, and artistry shine through in every photo and frame of video. Te Dua Weddings Photography isn’t just a vendor – they’re memory-makers. If you want to relive your day with tears of happiness for years to come, book them. 10/10, no hesitation, highly recommend!”Da'Shawn W., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/b124dd5f-038e-42b1-b661-f5df2369e453?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/enea-strora-photography-and-videography)

Zha Zha Photography 5.0 Sunnyvale, CA

  * Classic style

Whether you hope to celebrate your love on a tranquil shore or under a shower of glittering sparklers, my unique balance of classic portraiture with a modern photojournalistic style will transform those powerful experiences into timeless art. Together, we'll discover serenity in the chaos and genuine beauty in each moment.“We cannot recommend Zha Zha Photography highly enough! From our very first phone call to the final gallery, Zha Zha exceeded every expectation. We chose her after seeing her portfolio-her previous work at our venue perfectly matched the style and composition we envisioned for our own wedding. During our engagement shoot, Zha Zha immediately put us at ease. Neither of us is used to being in front of the camera, but she made the experience fun and relaxed, helping us feel natural and not take ourselves too seriously. The engagement photos turned out beautifully-we loved them so much that we used them in our wedding guest book and at our rehearsal dinner. Throughout the entire process, Zha Zha was warm, friendly, and a fantastic communicator. On our wedding day, she was always present and supportive, even stepping in to help with little things like tying my bow tie! Her eye for lighting and composition is truly impressive, and her attention to detail in both framing and editing made every photo look incredible. She also worked seamlessly with our videographer, ensuring everything went smoothly. One unique and invaluable aspect was that Zha Zha speaks Chinese, which made communicating with our families so much easier and helped everyone feel comfortable and included. This was especially important during our Chinese tea ceremony, where she was able to capture all the important moments and ensure nothing was missed. Her eye for lighting and composition is truly impressive, and her attention to detail in both framing and editing made every photo look incredible. We were surprised to receive a preview gallery of 75 photos just a couple of days after the wedding. It was wonderful to be able to share these beautiful moments with our family and friends so quickly. If you’re looking for a talented, professional, and genuinely caring photographer, look no further than Zha Zha!”Jeff T., 8 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/zha-zha-photography--2)

From the smallest details to the most emotional moments, our goal is to preserve every chapter of your day so you can relive it for a lifetime.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I don’t even know where to begin… From our first conversation, I felt like I wasn’t just hiring a vendor, but gaining a team that genuinely cared about our wedding. They didn’t just show up with cameras — they guided us, calmed my nerves, and captured moments I didn’t even realize were happening. When we got our photos and video, I cried… not because I’m sentimental (which I am), but because they managed to catch the real “us” — the laughter, the glances, even the little chaos. Choosing them was honestly one of the best decisions we made for our day. If you’re on the fence, don’t be. You’ll thank yourself later.”Zoe K., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/the-cinematics)

Sean Wash Photo 5.0

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $3,999 
  * Serves Sunnyvale, CA

Hi there! I'm Sean, a Bay Area native who is pretty darn handy with a camera. I started my professional photography journey during the pandemic after losing my job working in STEM and Art Education. I decided to bet on myself and pursue my passion, which is to be a full-time photographer. What excites me most about being a photographer is the opportunity to create incredible art with amazing people. I love meeting new people and connecting with them. Wedding photography is so fulfilling because it requires so much trust, and seeing the joy from couples when they see their photos is truly magical.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Sean was very helpful and extremely professional! He was able to answer questions before we were even able to ask them, and even answered one’s we didn’t know we had. Also, the pictures were spectacular. Highly recommend”Eddie, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/sean-wash-photo)

We couldn't have asked for better photographers to capture our special day. The photos are airy, bright, and perfectly capture all the details and couple shots.

Ripple Rain Photography 5.0

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Serves Sunnyvale, CA

The moments you remember most aren’t usually the ones that were planned. My approach is documentary-driven and unhurried, focused on connection, movement, and the quiet in-between moments that tend to mean the most later. I work best with couples who value presence over perfection and want images that feel honest, intimate, and timeless. Whether your day is big or small, traditional or unconventional, my goal is to create space for you to be fully yourselves — and to tell your story as it naturally unfolds.“Sharyce is without a doubt one of the best humans to have part of your wedding day. She is calm and collected and gets her stuff done with ease. We are so lucky to have found her and shared our day with her. Our photos are beautiful and they’re only just the sneak peaks so far! My wife and I are so excited to sit together in a few months from now and reminisce on all of the lifelong memories Sharyce captured for us”Noelle, 3 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/9b042c5e-ffdf-4fd3-a75b-a8821476340d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/ripple-rain-photography)

We hired Shelby to photograph our post-elopement family celebration/party, and while I was worried about finding a photographer who would be willing to work outside the box and be flexible for our needs, she put my fears absolutely to rest. She was warm, kind, professional, and clear in all of her communication, over email and in person. During our party, she was friendly and put our guests at ease. A day or two after the event she provided a photo highlight preview, so we got to see some photos almost immediately (so appreciated) — the final photos we received were absolutely beautiful and reflected her attention to detail and her ability to see and capture so many of those sweet candid moments you only get when all of your people are in one place.

Trung Hoang Photography 5.0

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $4,495 
  * Serves Sunnyvale, CA

My name is Trung, the head honcho at this eponymously named company. My name is pronounced “Troon”, which sounds like spoon, so ignore those other letters that make life complicated. I've been a photographer for close to 10 years, photographing things big and small, far and wide. It's pretty incredible how impactful and valuable a split second image of a given time, place, person, or object can mean to a person. Whether it's a photograph of someone you love or a place you'd love to be, photographs spark memories or inspire the pursuit of new ones and that's why I love it.“Trung went above and beyond as our wedding photographer! His photography is not only STUNNING and really captures the emotions of the moment, but he was incredibly organized, fun, and highly adept at problem solving. We wanted some shots by the ocean, but the wind made it a little difficult. Trung was calm in problem solving and his humor also helped make everything feel more relaxed. We can't express enough the difference he made in getting the shots we wanted, but also navigating everything so well! We are so happy to have gotten to work with him and highly recommend Trung!”Jessica H., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/2ca90804-498e-45b7-9227-7e0c97cffb41?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/trung-hoang-photography)

Hey! I’m a freelance wedding photographer with over five years of experience capturing love stories in a candid, editorial style. I focus on the genuine, unscripted moments—the nervous smiles, happy tears, and the little glances that say everything. Every couple’s story is different, and I love turning those memories into photos you’ll treasure forever.

We are giving you a timeless result - your wedding memories.“We chose Valentina and her team after speaking with a half dozen photographers.

Hi, I am Andy, a wedding and San Francisco City Hall photographer based in the Bay Area. I photograph couples who want their day to feel relaxed and unforced, while still looking polished and elegant in photos. I quietly document the real in between moments and then step in with gentle direction when you need it, so you never feel stiff or posed. From intimate City Hall ceremonies to full day weddings, I help you plan a simple timeline, find beautiful light, and make the most of every location. I personally edit each image with a clean, true to life style so your photos feel timeless and still like you many years from now.“We are so happy we chose Andy for our City Hall wedding. From the first message he was easy to talk to, clear about pricing and timing, and helped us understand how everything at City Hall works. On the day he arrived early, found great spots with good light, and gave us just enough direction so we did not feel stiff or awkward. At the same time he stayed very calm and kind, which really helped with nerves. When we received the gallery, the photos felt like us: natural, flattering, and not over edited. Our families keep saying how beautiful the pictures are. We would absolutely hire Andy again and recommend him to anyone looking for a relaxed, professional photographer.”Antony, 2 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/andy-pol-photography)

Hi, it's nice to meet you! I am Eszter, Wedding and Portrait Photographer, located in San Francisco Bay Area. Fueled by equal parts of hot chocolate with whipped cream and passion, I spend my days capturing images that make you stop, smile and ask time to please slow down. Life is beautiful, just like your story and your love and I can’t wait to capture it in images you will treasure for years.“Eszter was incredibly easy to work with, and when I initially reached out to ask if she was available for photos mentioning that we were doing a small and rather non-traditional wedding in the backyard, there was zero judgment. She went with the flow and put my mind at ease that she would work with whatever was in place. I spoke to a number of other photographers who had so many requirements and made it feel like they were doing you a huge favor, whereas Eszter really made us feel like she wanted to be a part of our day and capture each and every moment. Never did she try to sell us expensive add-ons outside of our budget, and she was incredibly responsive. Eszter is such a pleasure to work with, my entire family was thrilled to have her taking photos - she made us all feel at ease. And to top it off, her photos are beautiful! She captures the lighting, the expressions and candid moments, and also helps you pose naturally. I would highly recommend and hope to work with her again for future photos!”Sydnee & M., 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/eszter-timea-photography)

Paulina Perrucci Photography 5.0

  * Fine art style
  * Serves Sunnyvale, CA

Nothing inspires me more than capturing the love and romance that brought two people together. Getting those intimate emotions and moments that couples can treasure forever! I am a native Californian that loves to hop on a plane and shoot destination weddings in far off places. Achieving romantic and timeless images with natural light is my forte. My goal is to make from your entire experience from engagement to your wedding day all you dreamed and wished for. Please go to my website to read praise from past clients![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Paulina is an amazing photographer - we hired her for engagement and wedding photography! She is so pleasant to work with and is super friendly, which really helps to make us and our guests feel comfortable on the other side of the lens! This translates really well into the photos, as she is able to capture everyone naturally! On the day of our wedding, she was a great orchestrator as she gathered our guests and went through our group portraits efficiently and with the best light. Not only that, but as we (and some of our guests) are not sure how to pose, she was able to provide cues to make sure we were captured at our best angles!! She also made my husband and I feel extremely special, and made sure to make this day stress-free for us!!! She also processes her photos very quickly without any loss of quality - we received our sneak peeks the day after our wedding, our full wedding photos 1.5 months after our wedding, and our engagement photos 1 week after the shoot. I am absolutely in love with our photos (she made us look amazing!!), and we plan to print these to display over our home. Highly recommend hiring her for any of your photography needs!!!”Anna C., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/paulina-perrucci-photography)
