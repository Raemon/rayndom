I started shooting photos and video in Greece, and since moving to the US, I have dedicated myself to shooting weddings, elopements and engagements. I love being able to capture the love that my couples have for each other and the unique energy each couple has. I am always down to shoot in new locations and find the best place for my shoots!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“An amazing photographer who really took every opportunity to make sure he got the shot. Te Dua weddings were so helpful and friendly, they truly went above and beyond our expectations for a photographer. Wouldn’t hesitate to book them again. From great communication, showing up on time, helping the bride fix her sandals, making everyone feel included, and just having a wealth of knowledge for good photo opportunities. Thank you again Enea! You were amazing!”Matthew L., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/3c72a147-6b2c-4bee-9e76-0a9ce5954cfd?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/enea-strora-photography-and-videography)

My husband is very shy and hates taking pictures. Not only did she make him feel comfortable, she captured his joy and good nature. Everything felt natural and real which is what we were hoping to have captured for our wedding day. She captured his essence, all that I love about him and us. Even the fun “staged” photos came out great. I would recommend her a thousand times over.”Charlene Q., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/ba509c99-345a-4b92-91e3-2e9f2170ae8d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/vic-schaefer-photography)

Allison Stoddard Photography Tiburon, CA

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $9,600 

I’m a California native who fell in love with a British foreign exchange student, moved to London for two years to marry my love, and now we’re back home in California and loving it. I love being surrounded by trees, long hikes, chai lattes, The Office (American > British version always), s’mores, and lazy days at home. I’ve been a photographer for over three years now and absolutely love it. This is genuinely my passion and I hope that love I have for this profession comes across in my photos. I’m all about meaningful photos that you want to pass down to future generations and that capture your true personalities.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/allison-stoddard-photography)

Loren Hansen Photography 5.0

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $6,500 
  * Serves Tiburon, CA

Welcome. I’ve been a make-up artist, chocolatier, a barista, a pet-sitter, a bartender but I’ve always been “that girl with the camera.” (I’ve also been, “that girl who sleeps on our couch” or “that girl who’s booty I saw in the newspaper” but I digress…). Currently, I base my photography business in Petaluma, CA. I grew up in Sonoma County but in my early 20’s I picked up and moved to Manitoba and that’s where I stayed for many years. Upon my return to CA in 2013 I turned my passion for photography into a career. It’s been a journey to call photography my profession, but I’ve always been a photographer and I’ve always been an artist.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We cannot thank Loren Hasen enough for her outstanding work at our wedding!

My name's Meg and I'm an elopement & intimate wedding photographer based in Northern California. I specialize in unhurried, all-day and multi-day adventures throughout Sonoma County, Mendocino, Redwood National Park, and beyond. I help couples create an elopement experience they wouldn't change a thing about with a highly comprehensive planning framework, and deliver photos that they want to show off on every wall.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From our first phone call with Meg, we immediately knew she was the perfect fit for us. We were planning our elopement in California from New York so finding someone that we connected with and trusted without ever meeting was a big risk. But during our call Meg took the time to get to know us as individuals and as a couple, and ever more so after our first call to truly find out what we wanted out of our special day. Along the way she was so helpful with sending suggestions of locations, fun things to do, and once we narrowed it down sent a timeline to keep us on track. The day of our elopement we never felt like she was a pushy photographer like traditional wedding photographers are. She let us enjoy our time together and have those special moments. We can’t recommend Meg enough if you’re looking for a micro wedding or an elopement photographer!”Aubrie, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/a1c180f7-c0d1-44f3-9f6b-c90750bd5135?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/meg-cooper-photography)

Kristen Campbell Photography 5.0

  * Classic style
  * Serves Tiburon, CA
  * Offer

You don’t have to choose between meaningful portraits and actually spending time with your guests. I photograph weddings for couples who value being present with the people they love, while still making time for portraits together. With thoughtful pacing and smart use of natural light, there’s time for both. My approach blends joyful, editorial-style portraits with candid coverage, guided in a way that feels calm and unobtrusive. Outside of winter weddings, there’s usually more flexibility than couples expect, allowing space for portraits and time to enjoy cocktail hour, dinner, and the moments that matter most.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We found Kristen Campbell Photography on Zola and absolutely fell in love! We reached out to Kristen before we even found a wedding planner or chose a date. From the very first interaction, she exceeded our expectations. During our initial consultation, Kristen made us feel so at peace with the decision to hire her to capture our wedding day. She was incredibly transparent about the details and pricing, and the contract process was simple and stress-free! Every vendor we connected with was SO excited when they found out Kristen was capturing our day, and each of them shared how much they loved working with her. Throughout the planning process, Kristen checked in with us regularly, always professional and genuinely excited for our big day. By the time the wedding week arrived, we couldn’t wait to finally meet her in person. Kristen photographed our welcome party and her warm and friendly personality immediately put us at ease. My husband had never taken professional photos before, but she made him feel so confident and guided both of us with clear, easy instructions. She captured our welcome party beautifully and was so gracious and lovely throughout the evening. After that experience, we were even more excited for the wedding day. On our wedding day, Kristen absolutely blew us away. She was timely, organized, and brought so much joy and positivity to the day. Beforehand, she talked through lighting and timing with us, providing recommendations for the best photo locations and schedule. We trusted her completely and were so glad we did—her instincts were spot on! Wedding photos can take time, but Kristen made the process genuinely FUN. Couples' photos, in particular, were one of our favorite parts of the day because of how relaxed and enjoyable she made it. Family and wedding party photos were equally seamless thanks to Kristen’s thorough preparation and attention to detail—she made sure everything was perfectly organized ahead of time. Our family, friends, and wedding party couldn’t stop raving about Kristen. Her positivity and professionalism left such a lasting impression on everyone. She truly brought so much joy to our day, and we are so incredibly grateful for that. While on our honeymoon, we received our sneak peek photos, and WOW—talk about a highlight of the trip! We couldn’t stop looking through them in our hotel room. Kristen delivered so many sneak peeks, and every single one was absolutely stunning. From couples' portraits to candids, family shots, wedding party photos, and intricate details—each image took our breath away. Kristen captured every moment so beautifully, and we’re thrilled with how perfectly she documented the love and joy of our day. The lighting and style of her photography were flawless, but even more than that, we love how genuine each moment feels in her work. Kristen, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We feel so incredibly lucky to have worked with you, and we will cherish these photos for the rest of our lives.

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $3,100 
  * Serves Tiburon, CA

I’m a wine country native and learned the photographic arts from my family. My early travels and studies in the art & humanities opened my horizons to culture and diversity, plus I'm of mixed ethnicity. I really enjoy photographing weddings, because it has influenced me in a variety of unexpected and good ways. Each wedding has their own uniqueness, personality, and beauty. My life experience in wedding, portrait, & event photography has been a very gratifying and fulfilling journey. I’ve been pro wedding photographer for over 15yrs, and I’m insured.“My husband and I were first introduced to Marc’s work when we toured Vine Hill House and looked through a book of one of his weddings there. We were instantly enthralled by his style and how beautifully he captured the scenery and emotions of the couple’s day. We ended up working with Marc for both our engagement shoot in May 2024 and our wedding this past May, and we could not have been happier with that decision. Marc was very flexible and easy to work with, let our personalities shine, and struck the perfect balance of directing us while also letting us be our authentic selves. His eye for incorporating the surroundings and everything else that goes into perfectly capturing the moment is truly incredible. Both of us hate being the center of attention or having our picture taken, yet he managed to get some unbelievable photos that reflected both our relationship and the magic of the day and scenery around us. It was also really important to us that our vendors be LGBTQ-friendly, especially our photographer who would be working with our wedding party, and all our party members really enjoyed working with him and appreciated his inclusivity. He set a beautiful tone/energy for our day with all our guests and left us with the most stunning photos to reflect back on. Our friends and family are blown away by the final results just as much as we are! For these reasons and many more, we could not be happier with the decision to work with Marc.”Erika H., 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/74da8b2a-f575-4990-bfa8-833424893088?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/marc-blondin-photography)

If you would have known me growing up, you would have been surprised if I didn’t become a photographer! I fell in love with photography after spending countless hours in the darkroom. Since 2008, I have been working professionally in the photography industry and have shot over 300 weddings and numerous other assignments in almost every genre of photography. Why Weddings? I love problem solving and puzzles, and I’m always up for a good challenge. For me, a wedding is a day full of all of the things that I love. Its basically a whole day of coming up with solutions to make the best photographs for my couples.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Lisa is fantastic at her craft but also just a lovely person.

I am an irreverent guy who just so happens to create beautiful-rich-vibrant-uniquely-authentic wedding photography in and around the Bay Area, all over California and anywhere there’s beautiful light.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Russ is an absolute dream to work with! We discovered Russ by sheer luck and we were immediately blown away by his artistic talent as evidenced by his stunning photos! We as a couple aren't regulars in front of the camera, yet Russ made us feel so relaxed and comfortable throughout our entire engagement shoot. We're pretty silly by nature, and Russ capitalized on our playful personalities which completely shine through in our photos. Russ' ability to set up a shot and provide clear direction made the shoot easy, effortless, and most importantly fun! We still can't thank Russ enough for his flexibility and professionalism in scheduling our shoot. Our initial session was booked during a bout of unhealthy air quality in the Bay Area and Russ granted us the opportunity to make a judgment call on the day of the shoot to determine if we should move forward or postpone. We ultimately postponed and rescheduled for two weeks later, but on a whim we asked Russ if he could accommodate us a week earlier, and he cheerfully squeezed us in! Russ connected with us by phone on a few occasions leading up to our shoot, and he was always very accommodating to adhere to our overall vision. We had two locations that are close in proximity to one another in mind for our shoot, and we're so impressed that Russ managed to capture what appear to be five separate locations that offer such a well-rounded framework. We know we'll cherish these special photographs for a lifetime, and we highly recommend Russ for any and all photography needs!”Elena and B., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/russ-levi-photography)

I am a Mother, Poet and never-ending dog trainer of my 3 spoiled fur babies. I grew up around photography, my grandfather was a photographer and this has always been something I loved to do. I love people and I have a ton of fun working at events. I am always excited to capture these moments for people and proud to share my results afterward. Photographing people and moments over the years is my true calling in life. Gives me great purpose and I really do enjoy it.“Have you ever met someone you just instantly clicked with? That was meeting Mrs. Opal Prince. From our very first conversation, Opal completely understood my vision--and more impressively, she worked with me through every indecisive moment and my very type B planning style. She never once made me feel underprepared or behind; instead, she offered thoughtful suggestions, filled in the blanks when I couldn't quite articulate something, and genuinely partnered with me every step of the way. We first worked with Opal for our engagement session, which I was admittedly nervous about--especially since my fiancé has a five-minute photo stamina at best. Not only did Opal make the experience comfortable and fun, but she even brought in her husband to help manage our wild dog so we could get a mix of shots with and without him. When I say our pup couldn't have been in better hands with someone we had just met-l mean it. The session was full of laughter, reassurance, and ease, even as our dog did his best to cause chaos. And the photos? They were turned around quickly and completely blew us away. I had several people text me photos of our Save the Dates, amazed by amazed by the stunning pictures Opal captured. Those engagement photos will be treasured for the rest of our lives--and then came the wedding... Opal and her partner, Wing, perfectly captured the energy of the day--Wing with my fiancé and his groomsmen, and Opal with me and my bridesmaids. You can truly feel the personality and emotion, which I fully attribute to the energy they bring. Their calming, friendly presence makes it feel like you're just hanging out with a friend--not posing for a camera. Our wedding day brought its fair share of last-minute weather pivots, and while Opal's role was officially a photographer, she effortlessly became so much more. I found myself turning to her again and again, and every time she was there--calmly helping, offering direction, keeping me on track. Though she was not our coordinator, she filled that role in such a natural way, and I am so grateful for her presence on that day. I can't imagine not having Opal or Wing with us for future milestones. They are the kind of photographers who make even the most camera-shy person feel confident and beautiful, offering clear guidance and capturing magic along the way Book Sweetbay Photography!!! You will NOT regret it!”Lexi N., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/5e3fd690-cd6c-4f9a-a11e-bb43adbcc2bf?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/sweetbay-photography)

My couples are folks who value quality and intimacy, and want their wedding day illustrated with a unique album filled with artful candids, punctuated by breathtaking fine art portraiture.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Aryk is one of a kind.

Aryk always made me and Noah feel comfortable and listened to. They're sensible, communicative, professional, courteous, and always engaged. Always going with the flow, Aryk can adapt to change while still providing excellent results.

I have been professionally capturing images for over 10 years. During that time, I built a successful promotional marketing company in Canada, received my MBA in Ireland, and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with my wife. My favorite part about photography are the stories that are captured, the frozen moments in time that each picture highlights. Over the course of my career, I have been asked to tell thousands of stories. With the ability to operate in the United States, Canada, and Europe, I’m no stranger to traveling for a good story.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I have worked with Harrison and he is a dream to work with!

Welcome. I’m a southern girl, born and raised. Years ago, I drove to CA for the first time on a whim and well, I just never left. I love to travel, explore, and meet new people. My tiny dog, Gravy, is usually by my side. If there's fun to be had or a laugh to be shared, I'm in! And if you call me last minute to join you on a crazy adventure, I will say yes. Most definitely yes.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“As a photographer, it’s incredibly hard to trust another photographer with your family photos—our moments, our story. We feel so lucky to have found that in Tammy. She’s not only our family photographer, but truly part of our family. From our engagement, wedding, and maternity photos to family sessions and candid moments in between, Tammy has captured it all with care and intention. Even after moving to the PNW, we still hire her to come up—that’s how much she means to us. I can’t thank Tammy enough.

I photograph real people in natural light and gorgeous settings, throughout Sonoma & Napa Wine Country, the Bay Area, and beyond. Using humor, connection, and my calm & warm energy, I work with a wide variety of people from all backgrounds and perspectives (even/ especially camera shy folks!). I gently guide couples through very natural moments together, to capture their individual and collective personalities, in the most beautiful, & honest, way possible.“Jessamyn is one of my favorite photographers in the Bay Area! Being a wedding planner, I get to work with many different photographers all of the time. Sure - there are many talented photographers in the area for clients to choose from (Jessamyn being one of them). It's obvious by looking at her portfolio that she takes beautiful photographs but what you can't see online is how easy Jessamyn is to work with. When clients ask for advice on hiring a photographer, I always say that it's important that you choose a photographer who you are comfortable with. If you are uncomfortable, it will show in your photos. Jessamyn is extremely laid back in a good way. She goes with the flow and is a joy to work with. Her positive attitude and flexibility is truly what sets her apart from the many talented photographers in our area. I can't recommend Jessamyn enough!”Brooke, 6 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/jessamyn-harris)

Your love stories truly matter to us.“Jake did both our engagement photo shoot and our wedding (along with Shannon on video). Starting with the engagement shoot, I was really nervous and he made us feel so at ease and comfortable in front of the camera. It helps that he is hilarious and insanely talented. The engagement shoot ended up being one of the best memories of the whole year for us. Fast forward to the wedding (80 people) - Jake was flexible, prompt, professional, and captured insanely gorgeous and diverse photos. His photography style highlights the beauty of little moments and never feels rehearsed or pre-planned. You don’t need a team of photographers for your wedding - you just need Jake.”Keri T., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/2fe83806-954b-4e20-bc10-71272bb4df9d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/love-wolves-wedding-co)

My goal and passion is to caption the beauty of such a special occasion in a way that brings out the personality of those participating. I want their loving souls to shine through in my photos, and capture their true selves.“I had the privilege of hiring Niki for my special day, and I couldn't be happier with the results. Her dedication to capturing every detail and emotion was unparalleled, and her ability to tell our love story through her lens was remarkable. The professionalism and attention to detail displayed by her were outstanding. She made us feel comfortable and at ease throughout the entire process, ensuring that every precious moment was documented flawlessly. From the getting-ready shots to the emotional exchange of vows and the joyous celebration that followed, she managed to capture the essence of our wedding day in the most stunning and authentic way. Not only does Niki have an incredible eye for composition and lighting, she also had a talent for capturing the raw emotions of the day. Looking through our wedding album, it felt as if we were reliving each moment—the laughter, the tears of joy, and the overwhelming love shared by our family and friends. The photographs were not just images; they were tangible memories that we will cherish for a lifetime. Niki was also able to blend in seamlessly with the wedding festivities. She captured countless candid shots that truly encapsulated the genuine happiness and love in the air. Additionally, she was always attentive to our requests and managed to accommodate our specific preferences without missing a beat. Furthermore, she was prompt in delivering the final product. She provided us with a wide selection of images, beautifully organized and conveniently accessible. Her commitment to meeting our timeline and ensuring our complete satisfaction was fantastic. Overall, I cannot recommend Niki enough.”Alexandra, 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/niki-scioli-photography)

Hailey Hopkins Photography 5.0

  * Classic style
  * Starts at $3,900 
  * Serves Tiburon, CA

Hi there! It’s nice to meet you! I’m a lifestyle portrait and wedding photographer here in Santa Rosa, CA and I simply love all things photography. I would say it’s my one true love but that’s not very nice considering I have an amazing husband and three (soon to be FOUR! woah, I know!) incredible kiddos. I can’t imagine life without them. I'm a lover of life and my passion is capturing the big life moments for people that they look at and think, "I'll never forget this...thanks to this photograph!" Ha! Okay, enough about me. Let’s hang out and take some photos that I know you’ll love forever and ever! XOXO“We are absolutely over the moon with our experience working with Hailey! We first worked with her for our engagement shoot, and she immediately made us feel so comfortable in front of the camera. That same ease and warmth carried through on our wedding day, where she made us feel calm, relaxed, and exactly like ourselves. Her ability to capture candid moments and genuine emotions is truly remarkable. She turned around the sneak peek photos incredibly fast, and they are absolutely gorgeous—we can’t stop looking at them! We’re so excited to see the rest of the photos. If you’re looking for a photographer who combines a calming presence with incredible talent, Hailey is the one to book!”Evan T., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/7d49e750-c3b6-4034-b2e0-fc6379f35319?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/hailey-hopkins-photography)

  * Serves Tiburon, CA

I know you’re sitting there looking through a list of photographers & wondering which one should I choose?! I know how you feel! You’re trying to see which one will capture the most beautiful photos, which one will best fit your personality, will they be able to capture those candid memories, & of course, will they fit in my budget?“I have worked with many photographers over the years, but none as amazing as Holly D Photography. Holly is a great photographer and a consummate professional. She was my photographer for my own lifestyle shoot and made me feel at ease. The pictures came out beautiful. I've also had a chance to partner with her on projects and she has an amazing eye for every detail. The care she takes of her couples in making them feel relaxed and to shine in every photo is impressive. As a wedding designer, I know the importance of having a good rapport with your photographer. Her bubbly and warm personality makes clients feel relaxed. If I'm working with Holly, I am calm because I know that not only will the work come out perfect, my client will have a fabulous experience.”Kim, 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/holly-d-photography)

  * Serves Tiburon, CA

Maison Norde is a photography studio devoted to capturing weddings with a calm, cinematic sensibility. We blend film and digital to create imagery that feels textural, emotional, and enduring—rooted in light, intention, and the quiet moments that define a celebration.“We got married at my parents’ property in Santa Rosa, and Daria from Maison Norde captured the day better than we could have imagined. It was a very personal, family-centered wedding, and she fit into it so effortlessly—calm, friendly, and somehow everywhere without ever feeling intrusive. She paid attention to things we didn’t even think about: the way the light moved through the oak trees, my parents bickering over last-something, the little in-between moments when we weren’t aware of the camera at all. Everything feels genuine and beautifully composed without being staged. When we got our gallery, it felt like stepping back into that day- warm, emotional, and honest. We’re so grateful we chose her. I honestly cried at our photos”Polina and I., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/58c39de7-3364-49bb-8c5d-acf17c719aae?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/maison-norde)
