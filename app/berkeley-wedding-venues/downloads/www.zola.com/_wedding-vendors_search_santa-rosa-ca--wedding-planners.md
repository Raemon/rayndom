We had a very unique set up and their flexibility was amazing! The custom drinks reflected my husband and I perfectly!

  * Serves Santa Rosa, CA
  * Offer

For over 20 years, I have succeeded in helping couples, individuals, corporations and organizations plan their ultimate party or celebration. I offer partial planning, full planning and day of management services. With an extensive and diverse background in the hospitality industry, I have a thorough understanding of the market and all the nuances needed to champion a client’s every need. Whether throwing a bridal shower, wedding, facilitating a yearly team fundraiser or a community event - I can help you price and locate vendors and entertainment, negotiate deals, choose themes and decorations, provide onsite event management and more.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Tyler has a lot of experience in the wedding industry and it shows! From the beginning she made it clear what the timeline would look like for our partnership - what would be needed and when. When I became a little overwhelmed half-way through planning, Tyler was able to pick up additional scope of work which was a huge relief at the time. She also saved me a huge headache by picking up and dropping off some of my rental items since the minimum order spend for delivery was more than double my rental quote (my wedding was in a pretty remote area so most companies charged a high fee for delivery). Tyler was very thoughtful and organized about the little details I didn't think of which showcases her high degree of experience and attention to detail. She wasn't afraid to push on things on behalf of myself and my husband with our wedding venue - which I really appreciated! We had great communication throughout the wedding planning process - centralizing information in a shared Google doc. Tyler was willing to review my own personal wedding planning documents as well. She was always quick to respond to emails or texts, and also let me know in advance if she was going to be delayed in responding. On the day-of, Tyler had a great demeanor - when I saw her I could tell she was getting down to business but she made sure to keep things calm and light with me - making sure I felt comfy and relaxed on my wedding day. She kept things moving in the wedding day so we kept pace with the timeline. She made sure to account for all the logistical things like where to store decor items before and after the event. She was fantastic at corralling all the wedding vendors, collecting all the documents and information and knew when to keep me in/out of the loop at all times. Overall I would highly suggest working with Tyler for her high degree of experience, organization, thoughtfulness, and overall pleasant demeanor.”Emily, 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/de555fce-034c-40e0-a14e-cca17b45fdd4?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/events-by-tyler)

CES Weddings & Events 5.0

  * Offers 3 services
  * Starts at $4,500 
  * Serves Santa Rosa, CA

Since 2007, California Event Specialists has been bringing dream weddings to life all over. Whether it’s the Bay Area, Sacramento, Lake Almanor, Tahoe, Napa or Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, we’re all about making your vision a reality and having a blast while we do it! Our goal is simple: build real relationships, get to know exactly what you need, and bring together a team of top-notch vendors to make your day unforgettable. Every time, without fail.“Below is an excerpt from the Thank you we sent Jodi and team, which we believe captures aspects of their objectively excellent execution, but also the positive emotional outcome. We feel we have a unique perspective when it comes to evaluating wedding planners, because we had the unfortunate experience of needing to part ways with our original planners. The stark contrast in performance and accountability can be understated - Jodi and her team rocks! We honestly don’t even know where to begin—you are a lifesaver. Saying yes to us just five weeks before the wedding? That alone deserves a standing ovation. You jumped in with grace, got up to speed, and somehow made sense of our chaos like it was nothing. But your impact went far beyond showing up on short notice. You brought structure, clarity, and care to every step of the journey—transforming what could have been a scramble into something fun and grounded. You are incredibly talented at what you do. From the big-picture logistics to the tiniest details, everything felt seamless. Our wedding was beautiful and full of love, and that is thanks in large part to you. We felt so taken care of—Alissa still talks about how you checked in to make sure she was eating and drinking throughout the day, which didn’t go unnoticed. Mike and I actually joked that we started functioning better as a team once you came into the picture – you literally made our marriage better before it started - LOL. You helped us communicate, prioritize, and actually enjoy the process. Your project management was masterful. Nearly every call came with a clear agenda: what we accomplished, what needed discussion, and what was next. That structure may sound simple, but it requires disciplne and organization, and established structure that provided clarity and forced alignment, and which ultimately helped us move forward with confidence. You never let perfection slow us down—but you also never made us feel like we were sacrificing it either. And when you offered a different perspective, you did so with warmth and grace, always guiding us to better decisions with your experience and steady hand. You were a rock for us—even when we hit a literal speed bump, or two! You commanded the room when it was necessary and made space for celebration to unfold around you. We woke up the next morning (after celebrating until 4:30am—a good sign, right?) and looked at each other thinking: How do we move forward without Jodi as our full-time life planner? We’re beyond grateful for your patience, your poise, and your heart. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you. We already miss you. Please stay in touch—and if you're ever passing through Tahoe, you better let us know. With all our love and gratitude,”Michael Z., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/ces-weddings-events--2)

Whiskey Feather Events 5.0

  * Serves Santa Rosa, CA

My goal is to take the stress out of planning your celebration, allowing you to be present in every moment and enjoy the entire experience! With 20+ years of experience in Corporate Event Management, Hotel Sales Management, Restaurant Function Management and Wedding Planning, I have cultivated a well rounded and unique skill set that allows me to effectively plan and execute weddings and events of all types. I paired the ability to understand the needs and expectations from both client and venue/vendor side, with my love of event design and creating original and unforgettable experiences...and voilà! Whiskey Feather Events was born.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Jenny and her husband Chris were fabulous to work with! We decided to move forward with the month-of package, however, Jenny was in regular contact in the months before the wedding to make sure she had all the vendor information she needed to ensure a smooth transition for the month-of. We met weekly during the month leading up to our wedding, reviewing decor strike lists, rental orders, catering quantities, and addressing any concerns / hiccups that arose. The only factor completely out of our control was the weather, and as we had an outdoor venue booked for mid-October the likeliness for rain was possible but SO extremely low. Well... it happened. It rained the entire day, although it was a light mist, the dripping from the redwood trees above never let up. Jenny was truly our rock on the day of our wedding. She did everything in her power to make sure vendors were set up as best as possible, guest's seats were wiped immediately prior to seating, and she was able to pivot our entire dining experience from our intended plated dinner to more of a mix and mingle style service. It all worked out, guests raved about the wedding and Travis and I were encouraged and supported by both Jenny and her husband Chris throughout the entire day. We had a moment together prior to the ceremony where I was starting to panic, the rain was not letting up as forecasted and Jenny gave us a much needed pep talk: this was our wedding, this was our story and we are going to embrace the day! We did just that and it was incredible! I am so grateful that we booked Jenny and for her support the day-of and the month leading up. She is extremely organized, thorough, and her years of experience in event planning / management are evident in her work ethic and how smoothly the day went despite the rain. Thank you, Jenny & Chris! :)”Denise H., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/58543473-9a0c-43fc-8f5f-e8f9e1f1d3c0?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/whiskey-feather-events)

From start to finish Angelina guided and assisted us in all the ways we needed. Im based in LA and we had our wedding in SF. We planned everything remotely and she executed everything flawlessly. I never once felt unease or felt like i had to fly out and take care of anything myself. Our actual wedding day landed on a day where 75% of the city had a black out, raining, and on christmas week. Our ceremony venue ended up calling us the night before our wedding day CANCELING!! Angelina and the rest of the amazing women in OLW somehow made a magical wedding happen for us. It was truly a night to remember. Im forever grateful. This is a team of passionate amazing women capable of executing absolutely anything you throw at them. We would have been lost without them.

We signed on with her 11 months out, right after choosing her, and from that very first day, she became our absolute lifesaver. The Ultimate Planning Partner Melaina wasn't just a planner; she was our rock throughout the entire process. Even after we'd locked in our vendors, she took the reins on all the communication and nitty-gritty details. It felt like a massive weight was lifted off our shoulders. Her organization skills are seriously out of this world. We were constantly blown away by the crystal-clear timelines, detailed layouts, and comprehensive plans she'd send our way. Every single thing was accounted for, laid out so perfectly that we always knew exactly where we stood. It was clear she wasn't just planning a wedding; she was making sure our day would unfold exactly as we’d dreamed. Okay, let's be real – no bride is completely calm on their wedding day! There were definitely nerves as June 27, 2025, approached, but knowing Melaina had everything under control gave us so much peace of mind. At Viansa Winery Sonoma, her presence was truly indispensable. She was everywhere, yet somehow invisible, making sure the ceremony flowed beautifully and every part of the reception transitioned seamlessly. Because she handled all the logistics with such precision, we were genuinely able to soak in every single moment, laughing and celebrating with our loved ones without a single worry about what was happening behind the scenes. It allowed us to just be there, fully present and enjoying our special day.

Orchard Avenue Events 5.0

  * Offers 3 services
  * Starts at $6,000 
  * Serves Santa Rosa, CA

We help to-be-newlyweds navigate all aspects of planning a wedding, helping them arrive at a meticulously crafted celebration that reflects their unique personalities. From finding the perfect vendors to creating a unique event design, we can help you with every planning detail—no matter how big or small. Whether you’re looking for professional support for your wedding day or a full destination wedding weekend, we are here to ensure that you’re laughing and empowered during the entire planning process.“Brooke from Orchard Avenue Events is absolutely amazing! She made our entire wedding day flow effortlessly from start to finish. We found Brooke by searching for wedding planners that had worked with our venue (Timber Cove Resort) before. Having worked there before, it was a huge plus that she already knew the coordinators and had cultivated relationships with trusted vendors who were familiar with the property. This insider knowledge made our planning process very smooth. We decided to go with the partial planning package, which fit our needs well. Early in the planning process, we'd spend time researching vendors on our own as well as ask Brooke for her recommendations, then reach out to the vendors on both of our lists. We found ourselves choosing her suggestions almost every time. Her industry experience and keen eye for quality vendors became obvious very quickly, yet she never made us feel pressured to go with any particular choice. She simply provided excellent options and let us make the decisions. Throughout the entire process, Brooke was incredibly mindful of our budget. In our very first meeting, she showed us a detailed budget from a previous wedding she did at our venue and walked us through each line item, pointing out areas where we might want to allocate more or less based on our priorities. This level of transparency and attention to detail immediately gave us confidence in her approach. Her communication style was exactly what we needed. We often sent her emails late at night, and Brooke would consistently respond first thing the next morning with clear, comprehensive answers. There was not a single time that she didn’t address a concern in one of our emails, even when we sent her massive lists. She was also always proactive about letting us know when she'd be on vacation well in advance, allowing us to plan our questions and timeline accordingly. Brooke's flexibility was another standout quality. While our contract only covered the wedding day itself, we had planned a Welcome Dinner the night before and a Farewell Brunch the day after that we intended to handle ourselves. Unlike other planners we'd heard about from our friends who strictly limit their involvement to contracted days (which is understandable), Brooke was incredibly supportive when questions came up about these additional events. She went above and beyond by helping us order linens from the rental company and create layouts for these extra events. Not to say that future clients should expect this kind of support for non-contracted events by any means, but we were grateful for her willingness to lend a helping hand with the extra details that made our entire wedding weekend cohesive and stress-free. When our wedding day arrived, everything ran flawlessly! Even when we had a last-minute request to move our toasts indoors due to wind and chilly weather, Brooke handled it seamlessly without missing a beat. We can't imagine having planned our wedding without Brooke. Her expertise, professionalism, and genuine care for our vision made what could have been an overwhelming process both enjoyable and successful. We truly couldn’t think of anything negative when she asked for our feedback after the wedding. We absolutely recommend her without reservation!”Candace, 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/7eb76d9b-1606-4479-abd8-c9a3b0f4fece?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/orchard-avenue-events)

Learning the trade from someone who has been in the business for over 20 years, was, and still is, an amazing experience. This opportunity opened the gates and Lisa realized she loved planning and executing weddings and events. In 2012 she had the opportunity to start her own business and voilà, Lisa McAdams's events were brought to life.“Lisa was fantastic for our fall wedding at Brindare! She is so efficient and organized and made everything run so smoothly for us. All her vendor recommendations were fabulous and everything worked out exactly how we wanted it to. I cannot recommend her enough!”Devon E., 7 days ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/lisa-mcadams-events)

Wedding planning didn’t just become my career it became my calling. What began as helping friends create their dream weddings quickly turned into a true passion for crafting deeply personal and unforgettable experiences. I realized early on that a wedding isn’t just about the day itself; it’s about creating a moment in time that reflects a couple’s unique love story, values, and journey together. I founded Plantarino to combine my love for design, organization, and hospitality with the natural beauty of Wine Country. Sonoma County and Napa Valley offer the perfect backdrop for a celebration of love,“Plantarino Events was an exceptional wedding planning partner for our special day. From our first interaction, their communication was always effective, attentive, and they were fast to respond to any questions or needs we had. The quality of their work and the value they provided was unmatched - they demonstrated incredible attention to detail, were hardworking, and had excellent time management skills that allowed our wedding day to run smoothly and seamlessly. Plantarino Events truly helped execute our dream wedding by putting in the work to bring to life exactly what we had envisioned. The planner had a great eye for the small details that made our day feel exquisite. We are so grateful for their expertise and dedication in making our wedding day perfect.”Dulce & J., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/6338a169-ed1c-4387-9d0b-24313b895ef6?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/plantarino-events)

She has traveled across the world making sure each and every event she was at was organized, stress free for the client, and done beautifully. She has coordinated hundreds of weddings and is known for her calm, cheerful, and efficient approach to events. ​ Perfect for Weddings, Upscale Work Events, and Parties in Your Life. Book McKenna for your next gathering if you want to enjoy your party and not have to worry about a single detail.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I’m not even sure where to begin to describe how amazing Events by McKenna is at what they do!! McKenna is the most kind, helpful, and enthusiastic person to assist you during such an important time in your life. She made sure everything went perfectly on our wedding day and every day leading up to it! When we first started our wedding planning journey, we only knew where we wanted to have it, and due to the venue location not regularly being used for weddings, we needed to outsource vendors for everything. That's where McKenna came in and helped us out by hand-picking every vendor that she knew would provide the exact things we were looking for. From catering, florals, furniture rentals, DJ, and all the little details, she knew who would be perfect for the job and she was right about every single one! Every time we had a question or a crazy idea, she had an answer right away and she would do everything she could to make it happen. One thing that we were really hoping for was getting a disco ball above our dance floor, but since we were outdoors, it wasn’t looking promising. McKenna was the one who made sure that we got our disco ball, and it was absolutely perfect! That’s just one example of the many ways McKenna ensured our dream wedding would become a reality. On the day of, McKenna and her team were so efficient and handled everything so that my husband and I could relax and focus on ourselves. We got to our venue and everything was already done and ready to start the day! McKenna was amazing at time management throughout the day, and she was so helpful to not only us, but our families, wedding party and guests as well. Everything went perfectly on schedule and all the crazy ideas that we had came to life with no issues! It was truly the best day of our lives and it wouldn’t have been possible without McKenna’s help! I could write so much more on how incredible Events by McKenna is, but to sum it all up, they are the best choice for your wedding planning and coordinating needs and you will not regret choosing them for your big day!!”Ashlee G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/1dce3625-85f2-454f-a352-874335a59b7d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/events-by-mckenna)

*Please inquire through our website directly for more info, messages on Zola are not monitored* Two Perfect Events was created out of a love for planning. This developed into a greater love of bringing others happiness and relief in their journey in putting together their unique and perfect events.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We worked with Yoko from Two Perfect Events, and her team was on top of it every step of the way. Yoko made sure to get to know us and took every step possible over the year we worked together to make sure that we were prepared for the big day. She was in touch with our vendors, and our families and made sure that everything ran as smoothly as possible. We never felt behind schedule or rushed because Yoko and team were so organized and on top of it. They really took care of us throughout the entire process. Something we appreciate is that they anticipated we'd need breaks during the day and scheduled those for us as well, they also made sure we were fed and hydrated throughout! Our families could not stop talking about how efficiently the entire day was managed. 11/10 want to plan another wedding just to hire them again.”Woodrow J., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/3e641c57-a032-48c1-bf0b-fb57e5f03f12?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/two-perfect-events)
