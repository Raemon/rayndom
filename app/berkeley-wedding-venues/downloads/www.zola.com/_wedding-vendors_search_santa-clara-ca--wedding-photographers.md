Pricing: $350/hr | Instagram: Lightfallimagery /// Hello! I’m Victoria and I specialize in wedding, proposal, and boudoir photography. I photograph people all over the world and I am a published photographer. I charge $350/hr or $2,800 for 8 hours with a free engagement or boudoir shoot. Add-ons to my packages can include videography and second shooters. Message me for more details!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“This review is long overdue! Mostly because my wife and I have been 'honeymooning' these past few months but we wanted to also share our experience with Lightfall Imagery for our wedding back in November 2024. Victoria was super professional and showed up on time and was ready to take photos from start time to a little after finish. Unfortunately our other photographer from a different company cancelled on us so she had to work a little harder for us to help fill the role for 2 photographers and she did not dissapoint. My wife and I usually are not photogenic but Victoria helped us to feel relaxed and ourselves throughout our special day. We would absolutely love to work with her again. If you are ever considering a photographer for any occasion, Lightfall Imagery is definitely a choice you can not go wrong with.”Anthony & R., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/3d71b7e2-1887-4913-b7e8-c66615813942?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/vic-schaefer-photography)

Hi, I’m Carlos Garcia, your dedicated wedding photographer. Capturing moments that last a lifetime isn’t just my passion—it’s my commitment. I'm here to turn your special day into a visual masterpiece. Photography isn’t just a job for me; it’s a privilege to be part of your celebration. I take pride in creating a relaxed, enjoyable atmosphere so you and your loved ones can feel at ease in front of the camera. I aim to capture genuine emotions, candid smiles, and the heartfelt moments that make your wedding unforgettable.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Where do I begin?.. It can be an overwhelming decision when it comes to wedding vendors. When we came across Carlos @ Garciapics we were initially intrigued by his location being that he is in our hometown. Upon meeting him the first time, we were greeted with his enthusiastic personality, he came well prepared with portfolio shoots & pricing details. The fact that he was available & willing to travel to our ceremony location, beach wedding photo shoot and reception venue was a major bonus. There is no doubt in my mind we made the right choice to hire him for our special occasion. I feel so blessed and honored to have come across such an amazing photographer. I am grateful for his continued communication after we decided on hiring his services, he kept in touch regularly and responded promptly to any inquiries we had. I had family and friends videoing parts of our ceremony where he could be seen fluffing and fixing our aisle runner. That really touched our hearts, Carlos, we can’t thank you enough. The pictures were sent earlier than expected and we enjoyed reliving the moments captured. I wish I could attach all the memories but will include a few beautiful shots that he put together for us. We highly recommend his photography business! Thanks to your wife as well. God Bless.”Danielle V., 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/49f2b58d-3819-4d10-b3a2-c6164723bca4?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/garciapics-com)

Hi there! I'm Sean, a Bay Area native who is pretty darn handy with a camera. I started my professional photography journey during the pandemic after losing my job working in STEM and Art Education.

The moments you remember most aren’t usually the ones that were planned. My approach is documentary-driven and unhurried, focused on connection, movement, and the quiet in-between moments that tend to mean the most later. I work best with couples who value presence over perfection and want images that feel honest, intimate, and timeless. Whether your day is big or small, traditional or unconventional, my goal is to create space for you to be fully yourselves — and to tell your story as it naturally unfolds.“Working with Ripple Rain Photography was an absolute dream from start to finish! From the moment we first connected, she was easygoing, approachable, and incredibly professional, putting us at ease throughout the entire process. As a gay couple, finding someone who truly understands and celebrates love in all its forms was so important to us, and Ripple Rain Photography exceeded all our expectations. She brought a warm, inclusive energy that made us feel seen, respected, and celebrated. Ripple Rain Photography was more than just a photographer; she was a genuine part of our special day. She engaged with us and our guests effortlessly, making everyone feel comfortable and capturing authentic, beautiful moments. Her ability to direct us naturally while also letting our personalities shine was a testament to her talent and experience. And the pictures—oh my goodness—the pictures are beyond stunning! Every shot radiates with love, joy, and the magic of the day. From candid moments to perfectly composed portraits, she has an eye for detail and creativity that brought our wedding memories to life. The quality of her work is unparalleled, and her work ethic is impeccable. She went above and beyond to ensure every moment was captured perfectly, even staying late to snap a few last-minute shots we requested. If you’re looking for a photographer who is professional, artistic, and truly passionate about her craft, look no further than Ripple Rain Photography. She is an absolute gem, especially for LGBTQ couples who want someone who “gets it” and makes the experience unforgettable. We cannot recommend her highly enough and will cherish her work forever.

Trung Hoang Photography 5.0

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $4,495 
  * Serves Santa Clara, CA

My name is Trung, the head honcho at this eponymously named company. My name is pronounced “Troon”, which sounds like spoon, so ignore those other letters that make life complicated. I've been a photographer for close to 10 years, photographing things big and small, far and wide. It's pretty incredible how impactful and valuable a split second image of a given time, place, person, or object can mean to a person. Whether it's a photograph of someone you love or a place you'd love to be, photographs spark memories or inspire the pursuit of new ones and that's why I love it.“Trung went above and beyond as our wedding photographer! His photography is not only STUNNING and really captures the emotions of the moment, but he was incredibly organized, fun, and highly adept at problem solving. We wanted some shots by the ocean, but the wind made it a little difficult. Trung was calm in problem solving and his humor also helped make everything feel more relaxed. We can't express enough the difference he made in getting the shots we wanted, but also navigating everything so well! We are so happy to have gotten to work with him and highly recommend Trung!”Jessica H., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/2ca90804-498e-45b7-9227-7e0c97cffb41?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/trung-hoang-photography)

Hi, I am Andy, a wedding and San Francisco City Hall photographer based in the Bay Area. I photograph couples who want their day to feel relaxed and unforced, while still looking polished and elegant in photos. I quietly document the real in between moments and then step in with gentle direction when you need it, so you never feel stiff or posed. From intimate City Hall ceremonies to full day weddings, I help you plan a simple timeline, find beautiful light, and make the most of every location. I personally edit each image with a clean, true to life style so your photos feel timeless and still like you many years from now.“We are so happy we chose Andy for our City Hall wedding. From the first message he was easy to talk to, clear about pricing and timing, and helped us understand how everything at City Hall works. On the day he arrived early, found great spots with good light, and gave us just enough direction so we did not feel stiff or awkward. At the same time he stayed very calm and kind, which really helped with nerves. When we received the gallery, the photos felt like us: natural, flattering, and not over edited. Our families keep saying how beautiful the pictures are. We would absolutely hire Andy again and recommend him to anyone looking for a relaxed, professional photographer.”Antony, 2 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/andy-pol-photography)

Hi, it's nice to meet you! I am Eszter, Wedding and Portrait Photographer, located in San Francisco Bay Area. Fueled by equal parts of hot chocolate with whipped cream and passion, I spend my days capturing images that make you stop, smile and ask time to please slow down. Life is beautiful, just like your story and your love and I can’t wait to capture it in images you will treasure for years.“Eszter was incredibly easy to work with, and when I initially reached out to ask if she was available for photos mentioning that we were doing a small and rather non-traditional wedding in the backyard, there was zero judgment. She went with the flow and put my mind at ease that she would work with whatever was in place. I spoke to a number of other photographers who had so many requirements and made it feel like they were doing you a huge favor, whereas Eszter really made us feel like she wanted to be a part of our day and capture each and every moment. Never did she try to sell us expensive add-ons outside of our budget, and she was incredibly responsive. Eszter is such a pleasure to work with, my entire family was thrilled to have her taking photos - she made us all feel at ease. And to top it off, her photos are beautiful! She captures the lighting, the expressions and candid moments, and also helps you pose naturally. I would highly recommend and hope to work with her again for future photos!”Sydnee & M., 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/eszter-timea-photography)

Not only that, but as we (and some of our guests) are not sure how to pose, she was able to provide cues to make sure we were captured at our best angles!! She also made my husband and I feel extremely special, and made sure to make this day stress-free for us!!! She also processes her photos very quickly without any loss of quality - we received our sneak peeks the day after our wedding, our full wedding photos 1.5 months after our wedding, and our engagement photos 1 week after the shoot. I am absolutely in love with our photos (she made us look amazing!!), and we plan to print these to display over our home. Highly recommend hiring her for any of your photography needs!!!”Anna C., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/paulina-perrucci-photography)

Alexandria's Photography 5.0

  * Classic style
  * Starts at $2,000 
  * Serves Santa Clara, CA

Hi, I'm Alexandria and I am based out of San Francisco! I love capturing weddings and relationship milestones, and I am bubbly and loud. I am majorly creative and extremely dedicated to photography. I have been doing wedding photography as a hobby for about five years and professionally for about two years. I consider myself my couple's personal paparazzi! I feel like I get a deep personal connection and friendship with each couple I photograph!“From the moment we met Alexandria, we knew we had found the perfect photographer for our wedding. Her warm and professional demeanor immediately put us at ease, and her whimsical and funny personality made the entire experience so enjoyable. Alexandria's artistic eye and amazing talent were evident in every single photo she captured - we were blown away by the artistic quality of her work. She was truly in charge of the rhythm and schedule of our day, ensuring everything flowed seamlessly so we could just focus on celebrating our love. We cannot recommend Alexandria's Photography highly enough - she was an integral part of making our special day absolutely perfect.”Kevin, 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/alexandria-s-photography)

Mbm Photography 5.0

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $2,800 
  * Serves Santa Clara, CA

We are a team of easy-going photographers who love to document raw and intentional photography. Our style is romantic, documentary, a little moody, and a lot of fun! We will guide you every step of the way, but also allow you freedom to be yourselves.“Based in Mississippi, Megan did our wedding in New Orleans and was flexible, professional, easy to plan with timelines, and captured our day perfectly! She got our photos back to us quickly. I also love that she edits with color and slight saturation, rather than the more popular, washed white esthetic of other photographers. Obviously this is personal preference, but I refer Megan to family and friends! We've already referred MBM Photography to family and friends, and can't recommend them highly enough!”Julia L., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/b05e9c4f-1247-4794-a962-f53bfd020c8b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/mbm-photography)
