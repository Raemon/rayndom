Happy Wedding Pets 5.0

  * Pet coordination
  * Starts at $1,600 
  * Serves Santa Rosa, CA

It all started with a request... There was a client of mine whom I had the honor and pleasure caring for their family pet until his passing. Some time later, this same client reached out to me. It was for his sister who was getting married. After connecting with her, I discovered that she wanted more than a hotel pet care experience for her puppy dog. After talking with her, and learning about what she would love to have happen on her wedding day, I said yes!“I love that fur babies are more and more apart of people's big day but they tend to pose a bit of a scheduling nightmare and handling all their excitement can be a problem. Ruth was so great on my client's wedding day. Professional, sweet and helpful with the sweet pup - I would recommend her to all of my c.m.elle studios' couples!”Christina M., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/617e4f44-0081-4f62-b732-45701e10f77b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/happy-wedding-pets)

Festa is an AI event coordinator that transforms how modern events are run — starting with weddings. Instead of juggling group chats, spreadsheets, and endless back-and-forth, Festa manages RSVPs, guest questions, and real-time updates directly through text.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We had 180 guests flying in from three different time zones, and I was terrified of missing something. Festa handled everything—flight-delay alerts, last-minute schedule tweaks, even nudging my forgetful cousin to choose a meal option. My phone stayed blissfully quiet because guests just texted Festa whenever they needed an answer. I actually got to enjoy the rehearsal dinner instead of playing cruise director. If you value your sanity, get Festa.”Sofia M., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/festa-ai--2)

*Dearest is not a photo booth. Dearest is a beautifully simple way to gather and preserve memories from weddings, showers, birthdays, retirements, and more. Guests share photos, videos, and heartfelt messages via a personalized QR code—after the event, so they can be fully present. Every package includes a private gallery to view, download, print, or turn into a curated photobook. We also offer printable QR code templates, signage, and display cards on Etsy, with 100% of profits benefiting Vow for Girls, a global movement to end child marriage. More than a guest book, Dearest keeps the joy, love, and laughter alive long after the celebration.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Me and my besties had a girls trip and we took SO MANY memorable photos. Instead of sending, sharing, remembering, etc., it was so easy for each of us to just post the photos to Dearest. Voila! Everything is compiled, organized and shared.

Rueé—luxury, as you desire. We’re a women-founded designer handbag rental service for wedding week. Borrow authentic iconic designer bags for your shower, rehearsal, ceremony, and honeymoon—then return with ease. Two simple tiers ($88 / $168), professionally cleaned and insured. The right bag helps you carry your story and makes precious moments even more memorable. Sustainable, flexible, beautifully practical—own the look, not the bag.“I can’t say enough good things about Rueé! From start to finish, the experience has been seamless and truly elevated. I’ve always admired luxury handbags but hesitated to invest in just one or two pieces because styles change and occasions vary. Rueé has completely solved that problem—I now get to enjoy a rotating collection of gorgeous designer bags without the guilt or financial burden of buying them outright. The website is easy to navigate, and the pictures and descriptions are very true to what you receive. My bag arrived right on time, beautifully packaged, and in pristine condition. You can tell they take incredible care of their pieces—everything feels fresh, polished, and special, just like if I had bought it directly from the boutique. What I appreciate most is the flexibility. Some weeks I want a classic piece for everyday use, and other times I’m attending a wedding, event, or vacation and want something bold and eye-catching. Rueé makes it so easy to pick the perfect bag for the occasion. The compliments I’ve received have been endless, and no one can tell it’s a rental—it feels completely mine while I’m using it. The return process is just as easy as the delivery—simple, quick, and stress-free. Customer service has also been wonderful; they’re responsive, thoughtful, and genuinely want you to have the best experience. Overall, Rueé has made luxury fashion more fun, attainable, and sustainable for me. Instead of letting a few expensive purchases collect dust in my closet, I now get to enjoy variety, freedom, and confidence with every bag I carry. I’m already looking forward to my next rental—it feels like a little luxury surprise waiting for me each month!”Lena, 4 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/ruee)

  * Pet coordination
  * Starts at $550 
  * Serves Santa Rosa, CA

Labra-Adore You Furever is a proud women-owned, family-run small business offering wedding pet attendant services in Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama and the West Coast. We also offer dog boarding and housesitting services in the Nashville, TN area.“We cannot say enough wonderful things about Labra-Adore You Furever. Having our dogs, Charlie and Louie, as part of our wedding day was incredibly important to us, but we were also worried about how to manage them throughout the chaos of the day. From the moment Ashlee arrived, we felt completely at ease — she instantly understood our dogs’ personalities and needs and treated them with the same patience and affection we do. Charlie is rambunctious and curious, and Louie has special needs, so we know they’re not the easiest pair. But Ashlee went above and beyond for both of them. She comforted Charlie when he got overstimulated and even carried Louie when the floors were too slick for him to walk confidently. The level of attentiveness, care, and genuine love she showed was beyond anything we could have hoped for. What meant the world to us was the peace of mind she gave us. We didn’t have to worry for a single moment — we got to be fully present in our wedding day while knowing our boys were safe, happy, and cared for. And as an extra surprise, she even took photos of Charlie and Louie throughout their time together, which brought us so much joy when we saw them later. Those little candid memories are priceless. If you are considering including your pets in your wedding or any special event, please consider Labra-Adore You Furever. Their service was not just professional — it was heartfelt. We are forever grateful for the care, compassion, and peace of mind Ashlee provided. Truly the best gift we could have asked for.”Dan, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/ada063a0-8105-47e6-a03f-24e7469d22e8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/labra-adore-you-furever)
