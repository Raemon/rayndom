HRichardson Photography 5.0

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $1,000 
  * Serves Modesto, CA

I started my photography business with a simple goal in mind: to capture real, authentic moments that tell a love story in the most genuine way possible. Photography has been a passion of mine for years, and weddings quickly became my favorite because of the emotion, joy, and once-in-a-lifetime moments they hold. I love creating a comfortable environment where couples can relax and just be themselves while I document the magic. Every wedding is unique, and I feel honored every time a couple trusts me to preserve their memories.“HRichardson Photography was absolutely wonderful to work with for our daughters birthday. Hanna communicates very well and responds super quick! She puts the most effort into capturing memorable moments. Hanna made my whole family happy and involved, and even made my baby smile and laugh. We were very pleased with her work and attention to detail. If anyone wants photos they'll look back at every single day, she is the person to take them. Hanna made us very happy and delivered our album of photos the next day. I am just in AWE with how great she is - everyone needs photos taken by her!!”Jessica, 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/2b44960c-0e58-4e8f-92cd-5f93631ac79a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/hrichardson-photography)

I was born and raised in the Philippines but now call Northern California my home. I've been a photographer for over a decade and that journey has made me come to realize that nothing makes me happier than making those behind my lens feel amazing about themselves. My goal is to be so much more than your photographer. I'd love for you to consider me your friend especially because we'll be spending a lot of time together on your wedding day. Trust me to help fix any strands of hair that get in your face, straighten out your outfits, help you pose, and encourage you to enjoy this momentous day.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Tooney was the perfect choice for our wedding! She is a beyond talented photographer and our pictures came out perfectly, such an amazing way to remember our day. Pre-wedding everything was communicated well and in a timely manner.

Lauren Elizabeth Imagery 5.0 Modesto, CA

  * Fine art style
  * Starts at $2,000 

There is nothing more beautiful than a love story well told. Through the highs and lows of the past year of a pandemic, it is clear that love conquers all. The profound emotions, the small gestures and glances, the words of honesty and love shared are memories that will last a lifetime. I photograph weddings to highlight that connection, to ensure your feelings from that day can be looked back on and cherished forever.“Lauren Elizabeth Imagery is a dream to work with. I've shot many weddings with her over the years. Her communication style is relaxed, clear, humorous, efficient, and always positive. She puts everyone at ease throughout the day. Her images are distinctive, fresh, earthy, and emotional. She captures the story of a wedding in a way that feels ageless. Like a true artist, Lauren sees things in her clients (at weddings or portrait sessions) that others often miss.

Kevin Layton Photography 5.0 Modesto, CA

I thoroughly enjoy working with passionate, easy going, and family oriented clients. My clients are more than just clients to me. I truly care about them more then just clients. I consider them o be friends who I am emotionally connected with. I want them to be happy with their product just as much as my customer service. I aim to treat them the way I would want to be treated and going above and beyond to make that happen is what I do. Please don't hire me because I may be less expensive than someone else. Hire me because you like my style and because you know I care about you, We all have to make a living, but money isn't everything.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“It was great meeting and working with Kevin.

Meet Kathryn: I began my career as a wedding photographer almost 15 years ago, first working for a renowned Bay Area wedding photographer, and then officially opening Kathryn Lewis Photography in 2014. I loved capturing intimate moments, getting (maybe overly) excited about good light, traveling to gorgeous places, and helping set up the perfect timeline and obsessing about the details so clients’ wedding days could be seamless and stress free. Being able to do that for so many amazing clients makes this such a dream. I'd love to meet you!“Kathryn is the greatest! She really cares about every single client and giving them a unique and wonderful experience.

  * Starts at $3,999 

As you can tell, sometimes choosing your photographer can be an overwhelming process. There are so many things to consider when narrowing it down to your perfect match. Of course, style and price are the main two, however, some couples forget that your photographer is the one person who is with you the most on your wedding or event day. That is why we offer complementary sessions to all our couples so we get to work together and create a bond. Instead of just being "the photographer" at your event, our goal is to capture beautiful images from your day and leave you with an experience that enhances your memories.“We couldn’t be happier with our experience! From start to finish, Wedding Times Film was an absolute dream to work with. They have an incredible eye for capturing not just moments, but emotions—every smile, tear, and laugh was documented so beautifully. The photos were beyond stunning—timeless, elegant, and so full of life. [Photographer’s Name] has this unique ability to make you feel completely at ease in front of the camera, which truly shines through in the natural and candid shots. Not only were they professional and attentive, but they also brought a calm and joyful energy to our wedding day, which made all the difference. We’ll cherish these photos forever and can’t thank them enough for perfectly capturing one of the most important days of our lives. If you’re looking for a talented, passionate, and reliable photographer, look no further—Wedding Times Film is amazing. Highly recommend!”Malika, a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/universers-photography)

Hi! It’s me, Kyle. My photography journey began back in 2007-2008 while still in high school. I took two semesters of a photography class and loved it. Well then life happened, I decided to join the Air Force where I spent the next 6 years traveling the world but sadly, I did not travel with a camera, and I know not a smart choice. Since then, I have fallen in love with capturing the moments we hold special to us as people. A picture holds a memory that will never go away.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/kyle-ring-photography)

I’m Carissa, a California-based wedding photographer specializing in true-to-color editing, candid documentary coverage, and natural, editorial-style portraits. My work focuses on real connection, emotional storytelling, and the in-between moments that define a wedding day. With more than a decade of experience, I photograph weddings with an intentional, relaxed approach that helps couples feel comfortable, authentic, and fully present. My husband, Tyler, joins me as our videographer, bringing the same warm, storytelling-driven style to every celebration.“Ethereal, candid, jovial, refined are some of the buzzwords that the images of our oak tree & hanging lights, spring evening, 100 person ranch wedding brings to mind. Carissa made sure to get an idea of our and our family's priorities and vision for our wedding day photography months in advance. As the day approached she nailed down specifics of timing and herding those dear to us to capture everything we wanted! She has an eye for catching family dynamics, sweet background moments, and her whole team is quick to drop to the floor to get the perfect golden hour angle, play with long exposure, or get some kids laughing! They coordinated wonderfully with our other vendors throughout the day on things like equipment positioning and audio capture. We knew we would love any photos of us as a couple on the happiest day of our lives, but the width of their professional and personal vision for the whole picture is what truly captured our hearts.

I am a Central Valley-based photographer, but I am always available for travel outside the Central Valley. I focus on portraiture, wedding, and event photography. My mission is to work hard to deliver quality images and give my clients a comfortable, enjoyable experience full of smiles and laughter from the initial contact through the session and even after the final product is delivered.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Jess was beyond amazing and made our day so special. It was incredible how beautiful our pictures turned out and she captured everything I could have ever imagined and beyond. It was actually quite impressive looking through the wedding album after we received it because Jess seemed like she was everywhere all of the time. She captured every moment sometimes with different angles and I am so grateful to be able to relive our wedding day while looking through the photos. I thought I would regret not having a videographer but Jess truly captured everything from start to finish and that the day just comes back to life when I look through all of the photos. As she captured our wedding day she was soooo very patient with my husband and I, our family, and all our friends. Everyone spoke so highly of her after our wedding and really appreciated having a relaxed, caring, funny, kind, and professional photographer. She also helped me while getting ready and truly made it so I could fully enjoy my wedding. I also asked her to shoot my graduation photos and lets just say I don't think I will ever inquire for a different photographer. I am looking forward to continuing to have her capture precious moments in my life for as long as she continues photography. Thank you for being more than I could have ever hoped for and capturing some of the most memorable days in my life and making them so extremely special. You are the best Jess!!! 3”Dani G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/bbb45fa9-f7c9-46da-90e8-2b9fa586f870?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/jessshootme)

Northern California wedding photographer inspired by real moments between people who love each other and dreamy lighting. There is nothing I love more than capturing emotion and details in all the magical moments. I want to deliver photos filled with emotion, fun, and laughter. I bring lots of love and energy with me to make you feel comfortable so you can have fun in front of the camera. I work to build a true friendship with you to create trust which aids in gorgeous photos.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Natalie as our photographer for our wedding was like working with your best friend (I'm serious). She made us laugh the entire time, got just as excited as I did (if not more) over details for the flat lay, and was the perfect match for my husband's sarcasm. What more could you want in a photographer? What drew me, initially, to Natalie was her bright and light photos that captured candid moments beautifully. My husband and I have a very fun-loving personality and to find a photographer that captured every laugh was an instant-win. Natalie took our engagement photos and our wedding photos and we could not be happier, as every photo was absolutely amazing and told a story throughout the engagement session and wedding. I will always look back on these photos with the biggest smile on my face, because they are simply beautiful. You can tell that she is painstakingly meticulous in curating the perfect gallery for you and that she loves her couples. If you're thinking of hiring Natalie for your wedding, do not hesitate. She was an absolute dream to work with and I hope we can work together in the future!”Gabriela S., 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/natalie-renee-photography)

HI, I’M HILLARIE HUGHES . I am a lifestyle/wedding photographer based out of Merced, CA. I’m 30 years old, a wife and a mother to four beautiful kids. It's safe to say that I'm a VERY busy mama! You can catch me with my kindle when I’m not editing, and being as active as I can be in my children's lives. Never in a million years did I think that people would love my photos as much as they do, but I am so grateful and so blessed! I am learning more and more every session that I have, and have been incredibly lucky to have such awesome clients (turned into forever friends!) that have been with me during this entire journey.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Hiring Hillarie was the best decision I could have made for my wedding. I had a wedding at a venue she had never been to, and was a little nervous about her not being familiar with the grounds. My nerves were silly because she absolutely killed it. She over delivers and is the sweetest calm in the chaos. I wish I could relive my wedding day over and over, including having her there. I am so happy I went with her.”Catie L., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/2ff8c971-c655-4c02-a09c-4273693777a8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/hillarie-hughes-photography)

Kate Michelle Photography 5.0

  * Photojournalistic style

  * Serves Modesto, CA

From the moment we begin planning together, my process centers on trust and ease. I believe that beautiful imagery comes not from forced posing or rigid schedules, but from relaxed presence and genuine interaction — the fleeting glances, the laughter between moments, and the quiet exchanges that happen when people feel truly comfortable in front of the camera. Couples often describe my presence as calming, intuitive, and supportive, and I love helping even those with little photography experience feel natural and confident.“It is difficult to put into words how wonderfully Kate captured our wedding. Her professionalism and skill allowed her to take beautiful photos, but her presence and perceptivity guided her camera toward the most important, intimate scenes of the day. We were fortunate enough to have Kate with us for the full wedding weekend, as she got to know our inner circle of closest family and friends. She observed as hundreds of connections were made, countless laughs were shared, and documented the magic in those moments between our guests. Kate guided us through our camera-shyness and instructed us with her expertise on how to pose for photos. She effortlessly wrangled and directed our bridal party and families for a seamless, efficient photo session, somehow keeping us all on schedule. Our wedding was lighthearted and festive at times, as well as deeply sentimental and emotional at other times, and Kate's photos encapsulated all of it. We are so grateful for her, and couldn't have imagined a more well-suited photographer for the most special day of our lives.”Maggie, 11 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/1a79ca84-3775-488a-8277-7977a5bd8f1c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/kate-michelle-photography)

It was a pleasure working with her and highly recommend.”Tiffany Patel, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/brianna-noelle-photography)

Kelly Marie Photography 5.0

  * Classic style
  * Starts at $4,000 
  * Serves Modesto, CA

Hi there! I'm Kelly, and I'm a wedding photographer in Northern California + beyond. I specialize in capturing love, light, and laughter in color. Playful photo sessions mixed with poses that will make you feel like a model make me giddy. I live for the nose crinkle laughter and being there for all my clients' big moments. When I'm not behind the camera, I'm probably trying to find the best chai, hopping in the car for a road trip with my husband and husky, or tackling my every growing stack of books. I'd love to chat with you!“Kelly was a joy to work with for our wedding. Her kindness and attentive nature from beginning to end was wonderful. She listened so well to our vision and captured our day beautifully. She made us both feel so comfortable and relaxed when taking our photos. Kelly delivers such high quality work, making it all look so easy”Andrea S., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/1faaf0a9-15a2-4687-93c7-d4925fa32ab5?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/kelly-marie-photography)

For starters, I'm truly just your average woman who is constantly re-watching her favorite shows like Yellowstone + Greys Anatomy - I've got my hair in a bun, cozy sweatpants on and a beer logo boyfriend tee. I'm typically swing dancing in the kitchen to 'CoJo' or cookin' up some bomb ass pizza on the BBQ with my man. I'm originally from the Biggest Little City in Nevada, but I dream of owning a paint horse ranch in the texas, with a big open white and black barn and room for all my dogs! You know the ones we all see on pinterest.... but my new home in Georgia is everything I could have dreamt up and more.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/mckenna-payne-photo)

Since purchasing my first camera in 2013, a spark was ignited inside of me and my passion for photography grew. I love how creative you can be and all that a single picture can portray. For a while, it has been a hobby outside of working fulltime, but with every photoshoot my wife and I complete, I know that this is something I want to full pursue. As a team, Maegan and I hope to bring your visions to life and capture all of life's moments for you to cherish.

Alejandra Sol Photography

  * Classic style
  * Starts at $2,700 
  * Serves Modesto, CA

My name is Alejandra (but you can call me Ale) and I am a 27-year old Latina wedding & lifestyle photographer in Northern California. I have learned that capturing important moments and memories is so surreal; every time you look back at them you feel all the emotions you felt when they were taken.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/alejandra-sol-photography)
