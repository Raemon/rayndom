We were so happy with the service provided by Krysta at Happens Like Magic, our wedding coordinator. From the very beginning, I said my part in the planning was done & I was handing it off to her. I wanted to just enjoy and take in all of the moments of my wedding & not be bothered by the details or hiccups. Her communication style was attentive, prompt, and she was easy to communicate with. I only had to explain things once & she took it from there. She was always quick to respond to our questions and keep us updated on the planning process. On the day of the wedding, Krysta’s detail-oriented approach was evident. Any issues that arose were handled completely by the Krysta before I even found out. She was always there, so I never had to go searching for her. Her commitment to ensuring our special day went off without a hitch was greatly appreciated, and we are so glad we didn’t try to do this without her. We highly recommend Happens Like Magic to any couple planning their wedding.

  * ### Hire This Woman

•Verified review

•Annie S.•Oct 6, 2025

Happens Like Magic (Krysta) was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. We chose her month of coordination package, and she delivered on every element. Her communication style was very open, with regular check-ins and specific updates on the planning process. She is hardworking, detail-oriented, and genuinely cared about making our special day a success. Krysta was wonderful - with our wedding having a lot of moving parts across multiple spaces in our venue, she checked in with us regularly to ensure everything was being executed exactly as we had envisioned. She was constantly on the move, doing her best to keep our day running smoothly despite not exactly having a "Type A" bride to work with. Thank you so much for making the wedding day I dreamed about come to life!

  * ### Absolutely magical from start to finish!

•Verified review

•Mahlon Hopkins J.•Jun 6, 2025

Hiring Happens Like Magic was hands-down one of the best decisions we made for our wedding day. From the moment we booked, Krysta, made us feel calm, supported, and totally taken care of. She handled all the behind-the-scenes coordination — managing vendors, keeping our timeline on track, and making sure everything ran smoothly without ever feeling rushed or stressed. On top of that, the social media content creation was NEXT LEVEL. We woke up the next morning to the most beautiful behind-the-scenes videos and candid moments that we didn’t even realize were being captured. We got to relive the magic right away — and share it with friends and family while we waited for our professional photos. If you’re on the fence, this is your sign — book Happens Like Magic. The peace of mind and the amazing content are 1000% worth it! — A very happy bride & groom

  * ### An unforgettable experience 

•Verified review

Her attention to detail is unmatched—she didn’t just listen, she heard what we wanted. Every step of the way, she made us feel seen, understood, and completely supported. She brought our vision to life with such care and precision, and the end result was everything she promised… and more. We are beyond grateful for her talent, her heart, and her professionalism. Thank you, Krysta, for making such a special day feel effortless, beautiful, and absolutely unforgettable. Highly recommend to anyone looking for someone who not only delivers—but truly cares.

### Do you also plan other events, like showers or rehearsal dinners?

Yes! We love to plan all types of events. We have different packages for non weddings.

### How much time should we expect to spend with you?

Depends what package you choose.

### Do you take on multiple weddings in a day or weekend?

Depends, If your wedding is on a Saturday or Sunday, we do not take on more than one. We will focus on your wedding. If your wedding is on Thursday or Friday, we will possibly take on a wedding that Saturday or Sunday.

Depends which package you choose. Some packages are just me, Krysta & others require an assistant or 2.

### Describe your experience. How many weddings have you planned, and what are they like? Any specialties?

I specialize in day-of wedding coordination, helping couples bring their plans to life and making sure everything runs smoothly on the big day. My coordination style is hands-on, calm, and detail-oriented. I excel at timeline management, vendor communication, setup supervision, and making sure everyone feels taken care of and stress-free. One of my specialties is also offering social media content creation alongside coordination — perfect for couples who want candid behind-the-scenes moments captured in real-time. Every wedding is different, and I love being the person who makes sure the couple can stay in the moment while I handle the rest!
