Hi! I’m Carly :) Your new bestie behind the camera! I am located in Traverse City, Michigan, where I was born and raised, but I am always happy to travel for weddings + elopements. I fell in love with taking pictures at a very young age when I received my first film camera as a gift from my parents and have been obsessed ever since. My goal is to create timeless images that you can cherish forever, images that freeze your favorite moments in time. I’m not just a photographer, but a visual storyteller for loved-up souls.

When you hire me as your photographer you get so much more than someone clicking a button. I love creating relationships with my clients & going above and beyond to make the experience enjoyable and memorable. Awkward in front of the camera? No worries! I hear that all the time. I have great prompts that allow me to capture natural, candid and fun moments without feeling too posed or uncomfortable. I am happy to direct you so you don’t have to worry about anything :) Whether it be for sessions, elopements, or weddings – I put my whole heart into what I’m capturing to ensure I deliver beautiful images that you can cherish for a lifetime.

Carly Lynne Visuals provided excellent photography services for our wedding day. Carly's communication style is direct, honest and kind - she was always responsive and helped guide us through the process. The quality and value of Carly's work is fantastic, she captured so many sweet moments with great detail. We appreciated that Carly was able to be present without being intrusive. A few examples that contributed to our special day - Carly adapted our portrait timeline based on lighting conditions which resulted in beautiful golden hour photos. My husband was more comfortable after changing the schedule. We highly recommend Carly, she is very talented and kind. Her photography beautifully documented our wedding celebrations and we will treasure the photos for years to come.

## Frequently asked questions

7 Answers

Ask them a question

### Can I customize my wedding package?

Definitely! I understand that every wedding and every couple is different so I am more than happy to create custom wedding packages to fit your needs and work with your budget!

### How long will it take to get my photos?

I totally get the excitement of wanting to see your photos, with that in mind I always try to deliver galleries as soon as I can. For photo sessions, galleries will be delivered within a week of your session date. For weddings + elopements, I will get you a sneak peak of your photos within 24-48 hours. The rest of your gallery will be delivered within 14 days of your wedding, sometimes sooner!

### Do you travel and what are your fees?

YES!!! I am such a travel bug. I am happy to go anywhere for elopements and weddings. I try to keep my travel fees as low as possible, if the location is somewhere I can drive to, I charge by the mile. If I need to fly, I only charge for the flights. Please inquire to get more specific details on travel fees :)

### Do I have to pay a fee to print my photos?

Nope! All photos are sent to you in an online gallery. From there you are able to download and print any images! No additional fee from me.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors! I have a general range for each package with a guaranteed minimum of images to be delivered :)

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 6 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement!

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 12-16 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability. My schedule fills up pretty quickly! If you absolutely love my work, I offer associate shooters if I’m not available for your date who will capture your day but I will do all the editing!
