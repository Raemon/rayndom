James Korin Photography 5.0 LONG BEACH, CA

  * Classic style
  * Starts at $3,200 
  * Serves California

Hello Friends! I'm a wedding and portrait photographer based out of Long Beach, CA. Weddings are my absolute favorite type of photography and I love hearing about my couples love stories. My commitment to you is to provide with the best images of your life and a feeling that we are going to be friends for awhile. I will walk you through the whole process from start to finish and I'll make sure you take the time to enjoy your special day.“From beginning to end, James has been a great communicator. He has a calming energy that is very comfortable to work with when planning a big wedding like what we did. The first time we spoke on the phone we knew James was the guy for us. He is extremely thorough and one hundred percent committed to capturing the vision you see for your wedding. On the day of, his team showed up early and worked tirelessly. They shifted seamlessly, quickly adapting to any issues that arose, and when cold weather threatened our intimate sunset photoshoot, James coached us through blistering windchill with speed and precision. We've already seen a few of the sneak peeks and the photos look wonderful.”John C., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/james-korin-photography)

We hired her for our wedding and she was so professional and fun to work with. My family, bridal party and guest loved her! Vic had us laughing the entire time and made us feel comfortable with posing and suggested us the best ideas too. After a week or 2 after the wedding we got our photos and they were breathtaking!! Most photos I didn’t realized she captured since she was so quick on her feet. It looks like there was 3 photographers since she got all angles from the ceremony, speeches, and dances. We are so impressed by how amazing she is. We highly recommend her to photograph any event you have and want to make sure everything is captured!”Veronica H., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/57282920-12c1-4cb6-b418-903c5a213db8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/vic-schaefer-photography)

Randall de Leon Photography 5.0 Los Angeles, CA

  * Classic style
  * Starts at $2,000 
  * Serves California

Photography has always been a lifelong passion of mine, I picked up my first camera as a gift from my dad when I was 14 years old. Never in a million years would I have thought that my lifelong hobby could eventually become my career. I focused on my future, working my way through college and grad school to achieve my license to practice, but a part of me realized that I wanted to pursue a career that allowed me to go on adventures and meet a lot of new people. So in 2019, I took that risk, changed my hours from full time to part time and put more focus on my photography. I booked my first gig later that year and have never looked back.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We absolutely love working with Randall! He has been our go-to family photographer for years, capturing everything from my sisters' and cousins' special moments to my graduation and most recently, my wedding. Randall is incredibly easy to get along with, always professional, and super responsive. I never had to worry about a thing, he came fully prepared for our big day and made the whole experience smooth and enjoyable. He has a great way of making everyone feel comfortable, which really shows in the beautiful photos he takes. We will continue to hire and recommend Randall every chance we get. He’s awesome, and I 100% recommend him to anyone looking for stunning, heartfelt photography!”Jacqueline, 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/6728cce2-8757-4b31-848c-3d3e850c9af0?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/randall-de-leon-photography)

I have photographed many different niches, many events, many families, many milestones and my *ROCK* will always be love. Love is the foundation of every milestone thereafter and there is just something about it that I can’t get enough of! Every love is unique and it is truly a passion of mine to authentically capture it in whatever way is unique to each story.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Where do I even start? Nicole has been capturing my family’s moments from day one. While I didn’t use her for my wedding (and I wish I had), she’s been there for every other milestone since. We’ve done maternity photos, Mother’s Day photos, family shoots, Christmas photos, as well as marketing photos. Nichole has a photography style that leans towards documentary. While she is great at capturing posed photos, the real magic comes when you aren’t even expecting it. Nichole‘s photography style allows you to be present in the moment with your family or friends or whoever you’re with while she’s behind the scenes documenting it all. When it comes to turnaround time, I’ve never had to wait long. Nichole is also very good at communicating, she will never leave you on read. And if weather or some other obstacle arises, she’s very proactive when it comes to finding a solution. I cannot say enough good things about Nicole. The only negative thing for me is that she no longer lives in New Jersey. California you are so lucky to have her.”Emily, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/2bb80aae-de80-4792-a64c-7d080c951636?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/mates-of-soul-collective)

But we were unsure if we could find someone who could capture that on photo and video. Aladdin Films made it real for us. They got all the nice details, like the soft lights in the evening and the joyful laughter outside. Everything that made our day special, from the flowers in the center of the aisle at the ceremony, to the smiles of my parents during my brother's speech. They've captured them all. When I showed the video to my parents and friends, my parents cried, my friends cried, I cried, because of how incredible the video captured our special day.

They guided me gently when I needed direction and let me just enjoy the moments when I didn’t want to be posed. The photos look like something out of a bridal magazine, but at the same time they feel real and true to who we are. The video blew me away with how cinematic it turned out, yet it still kept the intimacy of our day intact. Friends and family keep commenting that it’s the best wedding video they’ve ever seen. I also loved how quickly they delivered everything compared to what I’ve heard from other brides. They are worth every penny and more.”Jessica W., 5 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/the-cinematics)

Hi, I’m Isaac. In my world, light is everything. The cool ambient hues at dawn, hinting at what the day may bring. Golden sun rays catching particles through a tree as friends gathers to celebrate. A Cotton candy sunset peppered by patio string-lights as a DJ plays my favorite song. We all have timeless memories logged in our minds. For me, they are based in a language of light. As a wedding photographer, this deep connection to special lighting helps me produce dynamic visual stories of romance, personality and beauty.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“A few things that stood out the most about Isaac were how responsive he was, how he was able to accommodate to our budget, and how he took pictures from angles and views that turned out great on the photos. As a couple with demanding careers, I much appreciated how quickly Isaac was with replying to emails. We had a pretty tight budget, and Isaac was able to offer us a package that landed pretty close to our budget and only had the items that we needed the most (mini engagement photoshoot for the website and wedding day). Our ask for him was to get some candid shots as we feel pretty awkward in front of the camera. I personally think that the wedding day pictures came out more naturally because of the setting being surrounded with friends and families, and Isaac and Sushen did a great job capturing the candid moments beautifully. Isaac even had an idea for me to pose by climbing up a wooden stair ladder for a shot that I honestly wasn't sure how it was going to turn out while doing it, but it ended up turning out beautiful and magazine-like in addition to other ones that he asked us to pose for. Isaac put together a behind the scenes video that also showed the reactions of guests to our photo place cards before we had entered the reception area, and this was lovely in that we got to see our guests' reactions that we weren't able to see.”Rafy, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/c08a0a6d-4be1-4bcc-8862-b11731c8d945?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/love-knot-photography)

Rivelle Media is a photography and videography company based in Los Angeles. Every couple, with their distinctive love story, transforms into a canvas where we paint with the play of light and shadow. It extends beyond the grandeur of photographing pivotal moments like vows, rings, and the first dance; it encompasses the art of capturing nuanced glances, shared laughter, and the silent connection that elevates an ordinary day into an extraordinary celebration of love.

The photos will speak to her technical talent; her professionalism and dedication to her craft are evident in every shot. It was so hard for me to only select 6 photos. What the images don't explicitly show is that Xenia was an absolute joy to work with. She is clear, transparent, and helpful in her communication. Her straightforward and friendly communication ensured we were always on the same page and felt supported throughout the process. While shooting, she is organized and efficient. We got every shot we hoped for and then some. Her enthusiasm and joy were infectious. She made these two awkward nerds feel comfortable and confident in front of the camera. We cannot recommend Xenia enough! We will cherish the photos you took forever!”Steph C., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/069b137a-f50a-40c2-9309-a795d92be09a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/rivelle-media-2)

Welcome to PKA Photography! We are a dynamic husband-wife duo, our journey began when our own wedding visuals left us unsatisfied in 2022. Instead of dwelling on discontent, we took charge, giving birth to PKA Photography in June 2022. In this short span, we've joyfully captured over 300 weddings and events, spanning from intimate elopements to heartwarming civil ceremonies. Each event embodies a unique tale, a celebration of love, and an opportunity to freeze magical moments in time. In every project, we step into your shoes, ensuring that your experience with us aligns with everything we'd desire for our own wedding.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I can't say enough about Mia, Laron and their team. Of all my wedding vendors, they were my favorite (and easiest) to work with. They were very accessible and easy to reach; I could message my random thoughts and ideas at any hour and Mia would respond almost immediately. They work tirelessly around the clock to get things done so you aren't waiting to get your photos back; mine were sent to me the next day. They are open to suggestions and ideas; I had different visions for my engagement shoot and they were willing to do things out of the norm to make it work. Our photoshoots were fun and unique. I did a boudoir shoot with Mia and she made me feel very comfortable in an intimate setting and it was not awkward at all. Mia is your hype girl! I love their willingness to go with the flow while still getting things done. Mia and Laron complement each other very well. They have different perspective from one another so when they put their heads together, there is more opportunity for creativity, visually stunning work and a unique experience. Highly recommend PKA for any event.”Taryn, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/158f905d-8038-4d5c-b133-12ba20ef155d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/pka-photography--2)

They were exactly on time and prepared. They were so attentive, patient, and responsive to us. Never intrusive or demanding. Their direction felt very easy and natural; it made the unnatural process of taking hundreds of photos feel so seamless and easy. I loved that they took advantage of the space and venue. They have such a fantastic eye for composition and scale - my favorites are the wide shots that capture the cityscape behind. Their photos feel so timeless but fitting for the venue. We could not be happier with the results. I could not recommend Lulan and his team more. They were responsive to all of my questions throughout the planning process.

I'm a digital and film Wedding Photographer in Los Angeles, CA. I'm trilingual and multicultural -- and it's my favorite thing about me. I will travel Southern California for your love story, from San Diego to LA, to Santa Barbara. My style is documentary and photojournalistic with a bit of an editorial and creative charm. I do not bend and sway with the trends of the current day, instead I focus on your unique wedding day to capture timeless imagery. As the moments unfold before me, I will help tell your story. I want you to look back on your images and be able to still feel the emotions within them for decades to come, truly.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I’ll be honest… when planning my wedding, something I was very nervous about was my wedding photos. I am a very camera shy person and was anxious about being the center of attention when it came to my wedding day. But working with Fatima made it so easy and seamless! Initially we didn’t plan on doing engagement photos, but Fatima includes them in her wedding package and they turned out great! My husband and I didn’t have much experience in front of the camera and it helped us break the ice and be more comfortable with photos when it came to the actual wedding day. Fatima really takes the time to make sure you are comfortable and yourselves, which we both really appreciated. From the introductory video call to the emails and texts leading up to the wedding day, we felt supported and confident in our photographer and vendors. The actual day itself was a piece of cake for us, even in front of the camera!”Paulina, 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/bc0ea345-96db-4559-968d-74afeb97d0c4?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/fatima-elreda-photo)

Weddings by Katherine Marchand 5.0 Oakland, CA

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $4,000 
  * Serves California

I'm Katherine, a wedding photographer based in Oakland, CA. With over a decade of experience and features in Vogue, Brides, The New York Times, and more, I know how to create wedding photos that don’t just look stunning — they feel like you. No trendy filters, no forced poses, just authentic moments that reflect who you are. I believe the best moments aren’t staged. They unfold naturally, in the quiet glances, the belly laughs, and those unspoken connections shared with your loved ones. My goal is to capture those raw, in-between moments that truly make your wedding day yours!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Katherine helped us capture our civil ceremony at SF City Hall and we couldn't have been luckier to find her! She is incredibly fun, professional, organized, and delivered everything exactly as she described. A few things we especially appreciated was that since we had a full destination wedding planned a couple months later, she was very mindful of our budget and worked with us to still get what we were wanting for the civil ceremony. She also created a fantastic guide to SF City Hall Weddings that she sent early and to help get us prepared. And she's very thorough and communicative; she responds to emails promptly and if there was even a slight delay in delivering anything she told us immediately. And of course the photos turned out beautifully! Overall, we just loved her energy. Since she set up a video call before our date to get to know us and what we were looking for, it was like meeting an old friend when the day came. She was so easy to work with and we felt immediately comfortable with her. I can only imagine what a joy she is to have for a full wedding! We highly recommend working with Katherine!”Victoria L., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/eed0cf86-39d2-43ff-83f6-30e562a958f4?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/weddings-by-katherine-marchand)
