“We loved working with our Hacienda De Las Flores team for our wedding! Johnny was our day of coordinator wand was wonderful. With our schedules being so busy we could not imagine planning this wedding without the WW team which for us took care of most things for us (food, decor, drinks, DJ). We appreciated the planning materials, binder, meetings which helped keep us on track. As my sister joked even if we did nothing, the wedding would still be great! We went with the recommended florist (A love is in bloom) and bakery (Old towne danville) and thought both were wonderful. We did chose our own Officiant and Photographer however. The venue is gorgeous and the weather thankfully cooperated for a beautiful early fall day. They were great about working with us and our decor ideas and playlist ideas. We loved our wedding! The only downside to be aware of is the noise ordinance which prevents use of microphones in the outdoor patio during reception (only pre-recorded sound/speech is ok). this was not ideal but we knew this was the case when we booked the venue because it is that gorgeous. We did speeches indoors in the dance hall which worked out fine though not ideal. We also had a tiny sound mishap during our grand entrance due to the pre-recorded nature of things but overall not a big deal. Overall think this venue is awesome and would recommend though of course depends on what's most important to you!”Vira F., 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/hacienda-de-las-flores-by-wedgewood-weddings)

We felt very heard and catered to. We received so many compliments from friends and family about the venue, staff, vendors, food, and music. It really is a "have it your way" set up, you can choose to have a big grandiose wedding or small minimalist wedding.

As someone who suffers from severe anxiety, I can honestly say I have never felt more at-ease and confident than while working with the Wedgewood Weddings Redwood Canyon team -- they always had our backs, kept us on track, and made us feel taken care of. From the first venue visit, during the planning meetings, all the way until the rehearsal and wedding day, the professionalism, clear communication, planning resources, and organized approach made for a seamless experience. We worked with Allison as our Wedding Planner and Coordinator and I firmly believe that she is one of the main reasons our wedding went as incredibly as it did. Redwood Canyon, provides a planning binder as soon as you sign that includes monthly checklists ahead of the wedding to help keep you organized in between planning meetings. It is also filled with valuable information about the wedding planning process, examples, vendor questions, and general guidelines. It helped us structure the planning process without losing the ability to truly personalize our event. Every meeting we had with the planning team was concise, direct, and organized -- it helped us stay on track throughout the process and gave us the opportunity to discuss ideas and ask for advice (which they are also more than happy to give via email). Super responsive and accommodating -- we were so impressed with how easy the process was. We also partnered with their recommended Bakery, DJ, and Florist as part of our vendor team, and the coordination between venue and vendors was absolutely seamless...by the time the week of the wedding rolled around all the main aspects were locked in and we knew the event was in good hands. The wedding day itself was perfect. Allison served as our Day-Of-Coordinator, and together with Jacoby (co-coordinator), Liv (banquet captain), Liz (banquet captain), and rest of the team (cooks, servers, bartenders) we had the most incredible wedding. We arrived at the agreed-upon time on the day of the wedding, and from that moment onwards, the Redwood Canyon team took over to deliver the best experience. They were organized, calm, kept us well hydrated and fed, and kept everything on track for us all night. We were able to confidently hand off the reins -- we didn't have to think of anything all day other than having a good time and enjoying our day as much as possible, trusting that all the logistics were in good hands. Overall, the venue itself was gorgeous. We had our ceremony in the Arbor Lawn, our Reception in the Grand Ballroom (we initially chose the venue primarily because of the dance floor), and rented out the Rose Room for the Cocktail Hour. Everything was included and beautifully decorated with all our desired personal touches, the food and drinks were delicious, and the planning and coordination services must be some of the best in the business. I can't imagine a more incredible experience than what we had and am so thankful for the Redwood Canyon team's care and professionalism -- especially Allison, who we were fortunate enough to work with from first meeting through the day-of. The wedding day went off without a hitch and I couldn't recommend the Redwood Canyon team more 3”Marina F., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/d5dda06b-10b8-4021-a2a3-f9a3854be326?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/redwood-canyon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

From the very first interaction, the staff was professional, friendly, and made the entire planning process truly enjoyable. Angela and Trish in particular were so helpful and attentive - they even helped me with my dress before I walked down the aisle when it kept getting messed up. The venue itself was memorizing, with an elegant and peaceful atmosphere that felt absolutely gorgeous. The massive space was the perfect backdrop for our special day, and we couldn't have asked for a more stunning setting. I love Angela and Trish, and I hope I have the chance to work with them again in the future.
