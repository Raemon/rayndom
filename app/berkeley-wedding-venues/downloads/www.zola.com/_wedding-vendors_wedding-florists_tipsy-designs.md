EDIT to bring more awareness. I am NOT a fresh flower florist. I work with beautiful handmade wood flowers. I hand paint them to fit your vision and arrange them. No silk flowers. (unless not available in wood) NO fresh flowers. I am sorry for the inconvenience. Please only inquiry if you are aware that I am NOT a FRESH florist. PRICING is linked through my website under my logo photo I discovered wood flowers when I was planning my wedding in 2020. From that point I fell in love and Tipsy Designs blossomed! Since then, we have done several weddings, even was hired by the football hall of fame in Canton Ohio in August 2023.

We strive to bring your vision to life in a stress free and fun way. We begin with a sample of the colors you chose, to ensure you like the way they look on the wood flowers. From there, we hand make your arrangements with love and care. We want this process to be as easy as possible! We know wedding planning can be overwhelming.

  * ### More than a floral artist

•Verified review

•Mary Dee N.•Nov 20, 2025

Ronna was our floral artist for our wedding on 9/27/25. She was the best vendor we worked with! She was so communicative with us, really making sure our color and flower design preferences were what we wanted. Not only that, she was a huge support system for me throughout the entire planning process. She drove 100 miles the day before our wedding to set up and install. She also designed our centerpieces! She went above and beyond, and I’m so thankful to know her. I will be a forever customer of Ronna’s and Tipsy! I can’t thank Ronna enough, and I will be forever grateful.

  * ### Lovely Flowers!

•Verified review

•Sofia Z.•Oct 16, 2025

Ronna and the team at Tipsy Designs WOOD FLOWERS! were an absolute pleasure to work with. From our first interaction, their communication was quick, transparent, and clear, putting me at ease throughout the planning process. When it came to the florals, Ronna was able to take just one inspiration picture and create an incredibly detailed, neat batch of arrangements that perfectly matched what I had envisioned for our fall-themed wedding. The end result was breathtaking - the florals truly brought our vision to life in the most beautiful way. I couldn't recommend Tipsy Designs WOOD FLOWERS! more highly for any couple looking for high-quality, personalized wedding florals.

  * ### Amazing Fowers!

•Samantha•Feb 9, 2024

Tipsy Designs created the most beautiful flowers for our special day, from the bouquets to corsages to even the flowered dog collar, everything was gorgeous! Everything I asked for was listened too and delivered. The flowers will be enjoyed for years to come!!

Response from vendor•Jan 2, 2025

Hi Samantha!! Thank you so much for your review. I truly enjoyed designing your wedding!! It was so much fun. Your pup rocked that floral collar too.

  * ### Breathtaking floral 

•Verified review

•Gwendolyn S.•Dec 19, 2023

I ordered my Wedding bouquets and boutonnières from Tipsy Designs before her business even had a name. She had done a friend of mines Wedding and I was in awe of how stunning and flawless they looked. Her communication was also on point. Which planning a Wedding made me feel at ease. I HIGHLY recommend Tipsy Designs for any event and even a nice table centerpiece for your home.

Response from vendor•Jan 2, 2025

Thank you so much Gwendolyn!! I appreciate, even to this day, the trust you put in me before I was who I am now! It means the world to me!!

## Frequently asked questions

7 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you have a minimum spend for weddings?

We have NO minimum. Just need a bouquet? We can do it! Just flowers for your tables? Count us in. No need to stress about a thousand dollar package, or minimum. We are here to help!

### What should we expect at our consultation? Do we need to bring anything?

Consultations last up to 1 hour but can take longer for larger weddings. Please come prepared with details about your wedding like your budget and style, as well as any inspiration you have for your wedding flowers. This can include images of your venue, photos of your wedding attire, fabric swatches, your color palette, photos from social media, and more. The more information and ideas you provide, the better we can assist you. If you plan on using your own containers, please bring them so we can evaluate and give you an accurate quote based on their size. After your consultation, we will draw up a proposal with prices and email it to you.

### Do you handle flower breakdown after the ceremony?

If you need flowers transferred after ceremony, this is something we can do if the full availability for your day is there! A lot of our brides receive flowers in advance, but we do offer delivery and set up as well!

### Can I see a mockup of proposed flowers?

Yes! After the contract is signed, we provide a sample of the flowers in the colors chosen for your day, typically these are mailed to you about 5-6 months before your event date. We show step by step of each piece (if bride wants that many updates) starting at 3-6 weeks before the final proposal and vendor commitments are due.

### How far in advance should we order our wedding flowers?

It’s never too early to get in touch about your wedding, but we recommend having a few details figured out before you do. For example: Have you selected the location for your ceremony and/or reception? What’s your wedding style? Do you know how many guests you’ll be expecting? Typically, our couples reach out around 6 to 8 months before their big day.

### What is your service area? Do you have a delivery fee for flowers?

We offer delivery and set up services within a 100 mile radius of Wadsworth. Delivery within 30 miles is free, additional mileage subject to fees. Since many weddings require a professional set up, we also charge a separate fee for event installation.

### What flowers are in season for our wedding?

During your consultation, we will go over different flowers. Because the best part of wood flowers, they are always in season!
