I’ve always been drawn to preserving real life as it happens. What started with documenting trips and capturing everyday moments of my growing family slowly turned into a passion for visual storytelling. Whether it’s through photos or video, I’ve always felt a strong pull toward holding onto moments that otherwise pass too quickly. Being trusted to document such an important day is something I don’t take lightly. I love capturing the quiet glances, the happy tears, the deep laughs, and the moments that happen when no one is performing — just being.“Visuals by Chase was an exceptional choice for our wedding videography. From our very first interaction, his communication was clear, collaborative, and transparent, putting us at ease throughout the entire process. Their calm, professional demeanor and adaptable approach made them a pleasure to work with. The final product was truly thoughtful, creative, and authentic - a cinematic masterpiece that we will cherish for our marriage. We could not be happier with the timeless quality of Chase's work, and we highly recommend him to any couple looking for wedding videography they can truly feel proud of.”Danae, a month ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/visuals-by-chase)

I’m Colin Pattison, owner and filmmaker at Featherstone Wedding Films. I film weddings because I believe in the power of marriage, and I have a passion for capturing special moments on film. I’ve helped countless couples create their ideal wedding film for over 10 years. My goal is to capture lasting memories through beautiful, personalized wedding films. From first consultation, to finished film, I’ll be with you every step of the way.“Colin was probably one of the easiest vendors to work with. We chatted on the phone to get to know him, sent him our deposit and that was that! We talked a bit leading up to the wedding, but he and my photographer communicated to get on the same page/ timeline so I didn’t have to stress much about that either. The day of, him and his team were wonderful all day. They themselves were professional, and all his gear was as well. One of the things I appreciated most about Colin was his ability to be everywhere to get footage, but he was secretive about it, so those that are shy on camera didn’t feel pressured. My videos I got were AMAZING. I don’t know how many times we have watched the videos together or how many I’ve watched it alone but, every time feels like the first. It’s beautiful work and truly captured our wedding day and our personalities. We also got raw footage from him that had us cackling. It’s awesome seeing the day again through both the finished product and the raw footage. Thank you Colin for everything.

Since 2016, I’ve captured over 400 weddings with one goal: to tell your story as true and authentic as the day it happend. From quiet, intimate exchanges to the wild dance floor; I focus on those in-between moments that matter most to you. Based in San Diego, I film across Southern AND Northern California and specialize in creating candid films that feel real, emotional, and true to you.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From the moment we booked Ebullient Memories Films, they were always there to answer any questions we had and make sure we felt prepared for our big day. On the wedding day, their team was professional and discreet, capturing all the special moments without being intrusive. The final video was beautifully edited, really capturing the sentiment and emotion of our wedding day. We had a mishap with our bridal procession song, but they seamlessly edited it out without us even needing to ask. The end result had the perfect home-movie/documentary feel that I was hoping for, without feeling overly cinematic. I'm so happy with how the video turned out and would highly recommend Ebullient Memories Films to any couple looking for talented, responsive videographers who will beautifully preserve your wedding day memories.”Kimberly J., 9 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/ebullient-memories)

Hi couple! My name is Nelvir Aquino, a wedding videographer based in Northern California. My mission is to leave you with a wedding video that makes you smile when you're older, cry when you need it and overall a video that reminds you what a special day your wedding was.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Nelvir is awesome. He has fair pricing and great work, with a good turnaround time. The day of the wedding, he showed up on time and got straight into recording. He followed us the entire day and had video content ideas that we would've not thought of. After the wedding, he quickly turned around the teaser video, which was very romantic (and a great video!). Though as a couple, we felt that something less romantic and more upbeat was a better fit — he took in that feedback and quickly revamped the vibe of the teaser. He also implemented this vision for the actual highlight reel. We could not have asked for a better outcome. Thank you Nelvir!”Jen, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/nelvir-pictures)

The link was easy to access and the video downloaded with no problem at all. We can also use the link to share with friends and family. We really appreciated how Danny was willing to work with us to put together a package for us to just capture the ceremony. His pricing was also very reasonable compared to other vendors.
