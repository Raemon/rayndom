  * ### The best planner

•Verified review

•Andrea•Dec 5, 2025

Alba, the planner and the amazing strike team behind Albita Decorations, did an outstanding job. From start to finish everything was handled with so much care and precision. The coordination, the florals, the rentals, and the décor came together perfectly thanks to a team that works with excellence and heart. You can tell they move as one unit, every person knowing exactly what to do, solving, organizing, and supporting each other to deliver flawless results. The strike team truly impressed me, fast, detail-focused, professional, and committed to making the entire event stress-free and beautiful. If you want a wedding or event where you feel supported by experts who treat your day like their own, Albita Decorations is the team to trust. Elegant, intentional, seamless, and unforgettable.

Response from vendor•Jan 10, 2026

thank you Andrea from the bottom of my heart for your beautiful words. It was truly an honor to be part of such a meaningful day. Knowing that you felt calm, supported, and able to fully enjoy every moment means everything to us. Creating a sense of ease so our couples can be present is at the heart of what we do, and your trust allowed us to take care of the details seamlessly. ✨🥂

  * ### Her attention to detail is remarkable

•Verified review

•Tatiana V.•Nov 15, 2025

Her attention to detail is remarkable—nothing is overlooked—and she always stays calm, organized, and solution-oriented, even when unexpected challenges arise. What impressed me most was her dedication: she was always available to answer questions, offer guidance, and make sure every decision felt right for us.

  * ### Amazing Decorator and Planner

•Verified review

•Anvi P.•May 5, 2025

As a wedding photographer, I had the pleasure of working alongside Alba decorations. From our first interaction, it was clear that their organizational skills and attention to detail were top-notch. Throughout the day, Alba and her team maintained a calm and professional demeanor, ensuring that everything ran smoothly. Their ability to coordinate with vendors and keep the couple relaxed made a significant difference in the overall atmosphere of the wedding. If you're looking for a wedding planner who is dedicated, creative, and truly passionate about making your day perfect, I highly recommend Alba Decorations. Working with them not only made my job easier but also contributed to a joyful and memorable experience for everyone involved.
