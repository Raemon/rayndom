  * ### Corporate Holiday Event - TOP NOTCH 

•Verified review

•Brandi R.•Dec 11, 2025

Sutherland Entertainment was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. Their communication via email was prompt, professional, and made the planning process a breeze. On the day of, their DJs provided top-notch music and entertainment that kept our guests dancing all night long. Sutherland truly went above and beyond to ensure our wedding was a celebration to remember. We couldn't have asked for a better band and DJ team to make our special day so perfect.

  * ### All Compliments We Received Were About the Music!

•Verified review

•Thomas and B.•Jun 19, 2024

We reached out to Sutherland Entertainment for our May wedding at the Berkeley City Club, and knew as soon as we spoke to Spencer that we would be moving forward with his company. Spencer was incredibly insightful, experienced, and innovative in ways that challenge standard DJ services. He offered everything from full service music and audio with club-style transitions, to station and bistro lighting, and ensured that his equipment was elegant and well suited to the venue. His style incorporated both our personal music selections, crowd pleasers, and was able to adjust to the crowd. From the time our dance floor opened to the time it closed, it was never empty. Every compliment were received the morning after the wedding included some mention of how great the DJ was, and how our Tuesday night wedding had such incredible energy. Spencer had our wedding guests doing the worm, the splits, dropping it low, and singing like no one was listening. Thank you, Spencer, for making our special day incredibly memorable and a true party!

  * ### Excellent!

Spencer was the perfect pick for our wedding DJ and photo booth contact! He was so communicative and so easy to work with! Of course he also had the best music, we can't recommend him enough!

  * ### The Perfect DJ

•Verified review

•Anna B.•Nov 16, 2023

Sutherland Entertainment was one of our vendors at our wedding this past weekend at the Brazilian Room in Berkeley, CA and we cannot say enough good things about Spencer! He was on the preferred list of vendors for this venue and we can see why. Spencer is detail oriented, professional and a great MC/ DJ. He has a variety of packages that offer AV, DJ-ing and even photo booth services. He is incredibly knowledgeable and we had zero mic feedback, great mic volume and clarity. He was able to read the crowd and kept the party going all night long! Before the wedding he made sure to send over a planning spreadsheet so he knew exactly what it was we wanted. He even helped put up some Chinese lanterns for us on the patio to really bring our vision to life. Day of, he checked in with us the whole day to make sure we were feeling good. We had a small issue with a table falling over and he was the first vendor to come over and reassure us that everything was going to be fine. Overall, Sutherland Entertainment is the DJ to beat and should be your first choice when looking for a full-service, awesome party.
