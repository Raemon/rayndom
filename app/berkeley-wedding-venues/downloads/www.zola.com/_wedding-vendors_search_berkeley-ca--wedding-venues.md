“We had a wonderful wedding - the Wedgewood team helped us create a meaningful ceremony and reception. The pictures online do not do this place justice - you have to see it for yourself! The grounds are beautiful; we had our ceremony at the pavilion and our reception in the garden area / in their indoor hall area. The venue definitely felt like a fairy / cottage core dream to me! Wedgewood also vendors that work with them and provide really excellent services - florals, music, cakes. If you want to have an awesome wedding and reduce your stress, I would check this place out.”Rachael A., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/hacienda-de-las-flores-by-wedgewood-weddings)

We felt very heard and catered to. We received so many compliments from friends and family about the venue, staff, vendors, food, and music. It really is a "have it your way" set up, you can choose to have a big grandiose wedding or small minimalist wedding. I arrived to the venue on wedding day with zero nerves because I knew the staff and coordinator knew my expectations.”Aysaiah and I., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4114f028-4335-4de9-b642-46714084461c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/jefferson-street-mansion-by-wedgewood-weddings)

The space itself was truly breathtaking, with its amazing new upgrades and beautiful views. However, there were a few details that weren't properly communicated to us, which led to a bit of a rocky start. Although my bridal party and I had lots to deal with prior to ceremony start, these issues were not something our guests would have seen/noticed. To their credit, the Wedgewood team acknowledged their mistakes and upgraded our bar package to make up for it. Overall, the venue was beautiful and the staff did their best to ensure our day went smoothly, despite the initial hiccups. We would recommend San Ramon Waters to other couples looking for a gorgeous wedding location.”Gabriella G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/09e08c08-a991-4f46-8f27-5f0c08b2944c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/san-ramon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“(Review for catering/events/venue service) I don’t have enough great words for Nicole and her team at Berkeley City Club. I planned my wedding entirely “remotely” from out of state and Nicole was always ready to answer my millions of questions and make sure everything was being planned to perfection. I had actually never seen the hotel in person, and I must say the architecture, foliage, vibes, etc are better and MORE stunning in person than in photos. Truly a breathtaking venue that transports you with its historic arches, details, etc. Wedding food is often lackluster in my experience, but I was thoroughly impressed by all of the plated dinner dishes we were served. My salmon was perfectly cooked and guests complimented their meals as well. They were also able to accommodate all gluten free food as I have celiac disease, which was the cherry on top. Additionally, a special shout out to the staff who worked the event day-of. Everyone was kind with bright smiles, and treated me and everything/everyone else with care.”Mariana S., 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/berkeley-city-club)

“Those are the two of the r elements I look for when sourcing a space to book for my events. Tarocco is such a beautiful space and the owner, Sequoia, and her team are incredibly easy to work with. From a photography and videography standpoint, the natural light is absolutely perfect. Communication prior, during and after our events were flawless and the food… I’ve had 2 events here and every time the food was both delicious to eat and look at. Parking is ample and the space is easy to find. I honestly can’t say enough about this space. The opportunities to make the interior your own is endless thanks to the minimalist decor. Tarocco is easily one of my top 5 places to book in the Bay Area and I continue to refer anyone here without hesitation.”Charlene, 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/tarocco)

“We had the absolute best experience hosting our wedding here. Natasha Norman was incredible to work with through the entire planning process. She was clear on pricing, set our expectations well, was incredibly responsive, and helped coordinate the event on the day of the wedding. We asked for some extra time to set up the room and, since the room hadn't been booked the day before the event, she let us come in the day prior to get everything in order. Natasha spoke with our DJ and coordinated for his set-up, which was very helpful. The team setting up the event also did the perfect job of setting up the tables and outdoor chairs exactly as we'd asked. I changed my mind on the arch at the last minute, and they had no problem making the change. The wedding was incredible, our guests felt comfortable in their rooms and were pleased they could bring their dogs so they didn't have to hire a dog-sitter. Everyone was impressed by the view and by the fact that the sun was setting behind the sweetheart table in the Bayview Ballroom. I also want to give a shoutout to the banquet manager who made us feel at home, kindly brought us beverages as we were setting up, and took care of us throughout the stay. I’ve received at least half a dozen compliments on the qualify of the food served, and I felt the pricing was very reasonable – especially when compared to other hotels on the water nearby. I also loved that the hotel provided us a contingency plan if we needed to move our outdoor wedding to the indoors because of rain or anything else. We truly felt special and valued and would use this venue again in a heartbeat.”Lindsey M., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-doubletree-by-hilton-berkeley-marina)
