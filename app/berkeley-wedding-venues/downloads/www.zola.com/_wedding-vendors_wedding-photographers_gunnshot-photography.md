Hey, I’m so glad you’re here. I’m a wedding photographer, yes — but more than that, I’m someone who deeply values connection. I love getting to know my couples, their families, and their chosen families. I photograph all kinds of love, but I’m especially proud to serve the LGBTQIA+ community. As a lesbian and someone who’s been through the wedding planning process with my amazing wife, I know how powerful representation is — and how much it matters. Whether you’re queer or an ally, I’m honored you’ve found your way here. Tell me your love story, and let’s show the world just how magical it is.

I'm not just your photographer — I'm your timeline hype girl, calm-in-the-chaos presence, and built-in wedding bestie. I’ll guide you every step of the way with real advice, thoughtful planning help, and all the behind-the-scenes magic that makes your day run effortlessly smooth. You’ll get a gallery that blends modern digital with dreamy 35mm film, plus Polaroids handed to you before the night’s even over (because you deserve something tangible right away). And while your full gallery is being edited with love, I’ll send sneak peeks within 48 hours so you can relive the magic before the confetti even settles.

  * ### Fantastic second shooter!

•Verified review

•Natasha C.•Nov 27, 2025

HIRE MICHELLE! Michelle was brought on to serve as a second shooter for my wedding and was responsible for capturing guest photos and groom family portraits. All of my guests and other vendors loved her, she produced amazing photos, and took great care of everyone. She is incredibly thoughtful in capturing as many people as possible and always puts them in the best light. One of my friends who consistently hates taking pics was blown away by how much she loved Michelle's pics. Can't recommend her enough.

  * ### Perfection!

•Verified review

•Andrew R.•Nov 18, 2025

Working with Michelle was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. From the very beginning, she made us feel seen, supported, and celebrated. Her communication was warm and effortless, and she brought a calming presence to every interaction. More than a photographer, she was a guide who helped us craft a timeline, anticipate small details, and stay fully present throughout the day. Michelle’s ability to blend digital and film photography created the most stunning, timeless images. She captured genuine emotion and connection, not just posed moments. We never felt staged or rushed, and she let our day unfold naturally while documenting everything with intention and artistry. As an LGBTQ couple, we especially appreciated how affirming and inclusive Michelle was. She created a space where we felt completely ourselves, which shows clearly in every photo. Her sensitivity, professionalism, and genuine joy for our celebration meant the world to us. Our sneak peak gallery is everything we hoped for and more; we cannot wait to see the final gallery. Michelle's photos are elegant, emotional, and full of life. Michelle is an extraordinary artist and an even better human being. If you are looking for someone who will not only photograph your wedding but also elevate the entire experience, Michelle is the one. We cannot recommend her highly enough.

  * ### Amazing photographer

•Verified review•Incentivized review

•Teresa•Sep 22, 2025

Michelle was absolutely amazing as our photographer. We worked with her 3 separate times. Once was for our engagement shoot, once for our ceremony day, and once for our reception day. She is not only creative but also organized and was on top of every detail. She captured everything I could have wanted. She made everything feel so natural and kept the stress out of taking pictures for hours. Can't recommend her enough.

  * ### Like we took the photos ourselves

•Verified review

•Rebecca S.•Sep 6, 2025

Having a professional photographer for our wedding was very important to me, and I feel so lucky Michelle was available and willing to jump in to our wedding plans in under two weeks. She captured our little backyard elopement exactly as we hoped for- like we took the photos ourselves. Also- she’s tough- like who else would smile AND get great shots during an outdoor summer wedding in Fresno?! Can’t recommend her enough

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### What makes you different from another photographer?

My creative but planned approach to your wedding day. I will capture timeless and candid memories of your special day. I am calm during times of stress and I will bring a smile and a feeling of serenity to you on your wedding day

### What if my fiance + and I are awkward and have never taken professional photos?

I’ve got you! 99% of my couples have never set foot in front of a professional camera before our sessions. My poses followed up by my prompts, will ensure that you get those timeless poses as well as the natural candid images (which are my favorite)!

### Have you ever photographed at my venue before?

Even if I have not photographed at your venue, I am confident than I can produce timeless images of your wedding. For venues that that I have never been to, I always try to do as much research online before I go. I will also arrive early on your wedding day to scope out the different locations for your venue

### Will we get the print release to our photos after our wedding?

All packages come with a print release! I do recommend to print all portraits and wall art through my professional print labs, as I cannot guarantee the colors/ print quality through un-partnered printing labs.

### Will we get featured in a magazine or blog?

Each wedding I do is featured on my blog which can be shared with family and friends. In between clients, I may submit your wedding or engagement for publication, but not something I can promise!

### What if you can't make it to our wedding?

I have many photography friends + associates who I have closely worked with who will step in and photograph the wedding for me the day of. These photographers are similar in style + personality (they’re my friends after all)! After they photograph the wedding for me,
