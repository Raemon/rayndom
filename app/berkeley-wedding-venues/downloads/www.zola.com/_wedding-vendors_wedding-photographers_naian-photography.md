Naian Photography was an absolute pleasure to work with on our wedding day. From the very first consultation, they were detailed and prepared, walking us through every step of the process and ensuring they understood our vision. On the day of, they were professional capturing all the special moments with ease. The photos they delivered were absolutely beautiful - they hit all the special requests I had and also provided great advice on unique photo opportunities we should take advantage of. The final pictures turned out exactly how I wanted, and we are thrilled with the value we received. I would highly recommend Naian Photography to any couple looking for talented, dedicated photographers to document their special day.

Natalie is amazing!! She did both our engagement and wedding photos. She was incredibly easy to work with throughout the entire process, and she's genuinely such a sweet person who cares about getting it right for your special day. She brought these white umbrellas to our wedding and we got the cutest photos with them! Would definitely book her again and recommend her to anyone looking for a talented and reliable wedding photographer.

•Racquel A.•Sep 20, 2025

Naian Photography was amazing to work with for our wedding. Natalie was amazing with communication and made sure to explain her process and understand my vision for my wedding. The quality of their work is beautiful and exactly what we wanted. She captured the beauty of our day in a natural way and helped us with our poses. She made it easy and was so kind. I loved having her photograph our special day and we received sneak peeks right away! She made our engagement shoot feel comfortable even though I get awkward in front of the camera. She is able to capture the best candid moments in a beautiful way.

  * ### Best wedding photographer ever!!

•Verified review

•Kailani C.•Jun 3, 2025

We had the absolute pleasure of working with Natalie for our wedding, and we truly couldn’t have asked for a better experience! From the moment we met her, she was incredibly sweet and fun — her energy instantly made us feel comfortable and relaxed, which really shines through in our photos. What really stood out was her professionalism and attention to detail. She was always one step ahead, capturing the little moments we didn’t even realize were happening. Her creativity and eye for composition brought our vision to life in a way that felt effortless and completely authentic. What made the experience even more amazing was her partner, Pedro. Together, they were an incredible team — professional, seamless, and always in sync. They captured every special moment without ever feeling intrusive, and their chemistry as a duo made the whole process feel so natural and enjoyable. Their attention to detail was outstanding, and they truly went above and beyond to make sure every shot was perfect. We’re absolutely in love with our wedding photos and so grateful for their hard work and talent. I would 100% recommend them to anyone looking for a photographer (or photography duo!) who brings not only skill and creativity but also warmth, joy, and professionalism to your big day.

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you also offer video services?

Yes, that is an add on if you would like videography coverage for you wedding day! We also offer drone services.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 8-12 weeks after your wedding. Within this time frame, you can also expect to receive sneak peek images within one week of your wedding in order to share with friends and family members!

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 6-12 months before their wedding date.
