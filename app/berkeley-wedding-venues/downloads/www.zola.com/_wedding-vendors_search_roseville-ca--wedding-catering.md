We took a bit of a risk, hiring C's for our wedding catering without trying the food beforehand, but we truly couldn't have been more pleased. They were so easy to work with, let us make a bunch of modifications, and had SO many people tell us it's the best wedding dinner they've ever had. Also, the brisket is absolutely unbeatable. We thoroughly enjoyed our massive amount of leftovers - they even packed up to-go boxes for the Bride & Groom for us to snack on later in the night. I just hired them again for our baby shower coming up in the Spring! Thanks Chris & Dottie!”Allie & S., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/c-s-bbq-catering)

YOOSHI SUSHI CATERING & EVENT PRODUCTION 5.0

  * Serves Roseville, CA

I had my first shot at managing a sushi restaurant when I took over an empty section of the family restaurant and introduced sushi to my customers. It was a challenge that I will never regret accepting. It was fun, a lot of fun! I had the opportunity to work with some really talented and creative chefs. I quickly learned that it’s not just about having fresh fish anymore. Sushi dining has transformed into a culture. A culture built by imagination and creativity. With the help of GD and the support of my family, I took all that experience and fused it with my imagination and created Yooshi Sushi Catering and Event Production.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Yooshi Sushi is ABSOLUTELY the BEST!

Sabores Komali 5.0

  * Starts at $1,750 
  * Serves Roseville, CA

We’re Cinthya and Maya, a married couple and co-founders of Sabores Komali, a catering company rooted in Mexican tradition and community. Chef Maya was born in Acapulco, Mexico, and has spent the last 25 years infusing her food with warmth, creativity, and cultura. Cinthya, raised in the Bay Area by Mexican immigrant parents, brings a deep love for community to our work. Sabores Komali is a celebration of Mexican identity through food. Named after the comal—a traditional griddle and symbol of home—our work is about more than meals. It’s our way of continuing the tradition of Mexican hospitality; full of love, generosity, and connection.“We hired Sabores Komali to cater my mom’s 60th birthday party and couldn’t be happier with the experience. From the start, they were incredibly easy to communicate and organize with, super professional and responsive. The food was so good! We had a mix of small bites and a taco bar. The shrimp ceviche, empanadas, and esquites were all huge hits with our guests. My whole family couldn’t stop talking about how delicious everything was. The taco bar was also delicious, with a variety of toppings and satisfying protein options that really made the meal feel curated to our taste. Everything ran smoothly, and we felt really well taken care of. You can feel the love and care Sabores Komali puts into their food and service. Highly recommend for any special event!”Stefanie L., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/029f5326-f202-43ce-95dd-8038780282de?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/sabores-komali)

Hiring them was single-handedly the best decision we made in our entire wedding planning process. We knew we wanted our food to be a highlight, not an afterthought, and the Americano team delivered a culinary experience that was beyond our wildest dreams. Our guests are still raving about it weeks later! From our very first inquiry, their catering manager (Beni) and team were an absolute dream to work with. They were responsive, incredibly organized, and genuinely excited about creating a menu that felt personal to us. They took our vision and elevated it with creative ideas, turning the tasting into one of our favorite pre-wedding memories. They made the entire process feel completely seamless and stress-free. Now, let's talk about the food on the wedding day. Show-stopping. We had the burrata with prosciutto and fig jam for a starter, and people were losing their minds over how fresh and flavorful it was. For mains, the slow-braised short rib literally melted in your mouth, and the sea bass was cooked to absolute perfection. It wasn't just "good wedding food"—it was exceptional food, period. The presentation was stunning, the ingredients were top-tier, and everything was served hot and flawlessly. Multiple guests—including our pickiest family members—pulled us aside to say it was the most delicious and memorable meal they had ever had at a wedding. Americano didn't just cater our wedding; they created an unforgettable experience that became a core memory of our celebration. They are worth every single penny and then some for the impact they will have on your day. Book them. You will be so, so happy you did!”Ferid K., 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/67264d27-dcc9-4151-a16a-9d70ee487046?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/americano)
