They made our bridal party’s bouquets and boutonnieres, and every single one looked amazing. Their prices were very reasonable too. Maryem was so sweet and fantastic to work with - we sent her a reference photo for the bouquets, and she was able to recreate the exact same ones and then also matching boutonniere versions. She coordinated delivery the day of the wedding, and even was able to make a couple last minute changes to the groom’s boutonniere after we found out his suit would be a different color. Truthfully I had never really thought about preserving my bouquet after the wedding, but I loved mine so much that I ended up pressing the flowers myself so that I could keep them. I would highly recommend Moon Florist to anyone looking for a wedding florist!!”Anna F., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/d43800b3-05ab-4430-b2dc-8f66b33f7e31?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/moon-florist--2)

Contact us today to give you a free quote that fits within your budget.“Mariane made such beautiful foral arrangements exactly with the flowers I wanted – red, blush, and white roses. The way the florals were arranged at the venue was also what I imagined how it would look like! We wanted bud vases as our table centerpieces and Mariane and her team arranged them so well and they looked so good with the lamps and votives! Budget is a big thing for me and Mariane was able to work with me on that without sacrificing quality, and she was also helpful with ideas on how we can repurpose our flowers :)”Kairin, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/63a8cdbf-ec10-42d3-a667-e011c6fc9674?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/c-m-fleuri)

Hello! I’m Fan, the owner and head designer at Fanfare Florals. With over a decade of experience as a floral designer in the San Francisco Bay Area, I’ve had the honor of contributing to hundreds of weddings and events. My mission is to create stunning, high-quality floral arrangements that not only delight the eyes but also touch the heart. I aim to craft beautiful, meaningful spaces that reflect your unique story and celebrate life’s extraordinary moments with beauty and significance, all while offering great value to every client. Thank you for considering Fanfare Florals. Together, let’s create memories that will bloom forever.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Fan was an absolute joy to work with! If you’ve stumbled upon her page, take this as your sign: you’ve found your florist. She was one of my favorite vendors to work with leading up to and on the big day. Fan was willing to work with me within my budget and make my dream come to life. Her attention to detail is unmatched. I didn’t have a planner and was juggling countless little things, but with Fan, I felt completely at ease. She anticipated details I never would have thought of like timing the placement of eucalyptus runners so they wouldn’t burn in the sun, which made all the difference. She was also incredibly patient as we decided on my bouquet. I was very particular, and she went above and beyond, even coordinating with three different vendors to get it perfect. The end result was stunning, and I received endless compliments on the flowers all night long. Her pricing is also competitive and probably the best for the level of quality she delivers.

We used one of her arches for the ceremony, and she was able to transfer the arch florals to our sweetheart table at the reception (which was at a different location than the ceremony to boot), which I so appreciated. The centerpieces and bud vase arrangements and everything looked so beautiful, and were actually bigger than I expected! She was never pushy or trying to upsell about anything, and even suggested a more cost effective way to get a lush look on the tables - leaf scatter instead of more arrangements! On the day-of it ended up being sort of long branches of leaves, and they looked so beautiful. She also was so accommodating when I wanted to make my own bud vases, and helped me make sure they were the right size and shape and that she got them in time. Thank you Beth!”Christina B., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/ce8ff763-df83-46c1-bfc1-4cc58f1a401f?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/sassy-diva-designs-events)

H & J Flowers 5.0

  * Serves San Jose, CA

We love creating custom floral arrangements and other wedding decor. What started as something fun to do for family and friends quickly became a way to share our creativity with others. We are dedicated to making your wedding decor something your guests will be talking about for years to come. Anyone can have flowers at their wedding, but we want yours to be memorable. We specialize in unique, custom designs that bring a couple's personality to the forefront.“When I first got engaged, every instagram post I saw from local venues where I was obsessing over the florals turned out to be creations from H & J Flowers! So before I even had a venue, I reached out to Hylary and told her I HAD to have her and her team as my florists! From the first phone call Hylary was a dream to work with! She even helped me find amazing options for different venues at the beginning of my planning journey!! I had told her which wedding on their website portfolio really stood out to me, and she tweaked it based on our conversation to match my style a little closer and to include my favorite flowers (sunflowers) in the centerpieces and bouquets, too! She was so responsive and supportive during all interactions and was flexible with changes that I had to make about a month before the big day! We had a micro wedding for our day, so the florals had to be delivered to the hotel instead of the venue per our venue contract which they were happy to accommodate! When I tell you my jaw was on the floor when I saw my bridal bouquet, it would be an understatement. H & J Flowers created masterpieces that were beyond what I could have ever imagined. My bouquet was STUNNING and was exactly what every bride dreams to hold on their special day. The centerpieces were amazingly gorgeous and complimented the venue seamlessly. And the corsages and boutonnières were high quality and simply perfect. We are so thankful to Hylary, Jason, Jacquie, and the rest of the team for bringing so much beauty and magic to our wedding day!

In 2013, 8-year wedding veteran Amy McCord Jones realizes she wouldn't be able to afford to hire her own floral services if she was a bride. Then, Amy discovers that there is basically zero help available for DIY brides. No flower recipes. No instructions. No access to florist-grade blooms. Rude. So she launches Flower Moxie! Flower Moxie remains a humble, tucked-away small business out of Oklahoma City. We don’t zoom around on scooters in some fancy high-rise. We stock an average kitchen with canned wine and Aldi chips and listen to true crime podcasts while photographing curvy ranunculus. Join us.

From start to finish, Brittany was responsive, caring and efficient! We rented the ‘Moody Romance’ suite and I purchased an add on of a custom bridal bouquet and boutonnière! I had done thorough research on purchasing real flowers and while price was our driving factor, I loved the element of saving on waste with renting and the option to purchase a keepsake! Brittany spent time talking to me so many times about questions I had and was incredibly patient! With the custom bouquet, I was able to upload inspiration photos and she NAILED it! The shipping process was so seamless as well. Brittany provided the tracking numbers and thorough instructions on receiving and then returning the flowers.

From our first meeting to the day of, she was lovely to work with and took the time to truly understand the vibe we wanted for our wedding. I had a hard time articulating exactly what I was looking for, but she was so patient and skilled at asking the right questions to pull out the details that mattered. I didn't have one specific inspiration photo to base things off of, but a general vibe we were going for, and she nailed it! She had great suggestions, and truly brought our vision to life in a way I couldn't have even imagined. The arrangements (and her candles) were stunning, and our guests haven't stopped talking about them. They were easily one of the highlights of the day. I would use her over and over again if I could.”Sloane, 17 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/fb7044e3-894a-47d3-9826-58e7e6b2ed40?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/l-artiste-fleur)

My name is Judy Leung (she/her) and Found Floral is based in San Francisco Bay area & beyond. Found floral is rooted in intentional and modern approach to floral and event design. With a focus on creating a flowerful experience that celebrates the culture and stories that are uniquely yours.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Judy at Found Floral was one of the best decisions my husband and I made during our wedding planning process! I knew I wanted florals that were textured and unique and not too cookie-cutter or traditional, so this was my top criteria when searching for a florist. Judy was able to masterfully bring the vintage backyard dinner party feel to our wedding which had 260 guests and still make our wedding feel unique (each table had different tropical and rarely seen flowers). Over 20 of our guests have mentioned to me since how much they loved the florals at our wedding since then - so many people have complimented our florals and shared that they are their favorite florals they've ever seen at a wedding and are still thinking about them today (some guests even have group texts focused specifically on our wedding florals)! The other big thing Judy did for us was the florals for the mandap (arch) for the ceremony - it was so spectacular and such an incredible focal point! It was raining for our entire ceremony so we were grateful to have a pop of color against the grey backdrop. The Found Floral team also used such unique flowers for the arch and laid them out in a way that was the perfect balance of textured but also refined (without being stiff or overly formal). My favorite part of working with Judy was that she took the time to understand my vision but then was able to operate and make decisions independently to bring that vision to life. There are 10000 things to do during wedding planning and it was such a relief to know we were in good hands with Judy and not having to make tiny decisions like picking out individual flowers or greenery or designing much of anything. I would work with Judy again in a heartbeat - she has such a chic unique style and is warm and makes her clients feel so comfortable at every stage of the process. Found Floral truly is the best florist in the Bay Area!!”Joanna K., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/12e771a6-5cf2-412f-aac0-2cd9ab246860?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/found-floral)
