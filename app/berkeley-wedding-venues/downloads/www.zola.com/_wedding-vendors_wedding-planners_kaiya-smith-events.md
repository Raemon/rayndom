  * ### Professional, detail-oriented and a problem-solver

•Verified review

•Gaia O.•Sep 9, 2025

Kaiya Smith Events was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. From the very beginning, their communication style was thorough, frequent, and professional. As a team of problem solvers who are incredibly detail-oriented and rigorous, they were instrumental in the success of our special day. Kaiya and her team's day-of coordination and vendor wrangling prior to the event ensured everything ran seamlessly. I would 100% recommend working with Kaiya Smith Events for your wedding or event. She was kind and professional from start to finish, and her deep knowledge of the Bay Area wedding industry made her an invaluable resource on our team. We couldn't have imagined working with anybody else for our wedding!

  * ### Flawless and Stress Free Planning and Coordination

•Verified review

•Paul K.•Aug 13, 2025

We just had our wedding on August 9th, 2025 and from the first day we met with Kaiya we felt like we had a huge weight lifted from our shoulders. She helped us organize and prioritize our timeline, vendors, and must-haves for our weekend. From flowers, to DJ, to cake, and so much more she handled the coordination perfectly. We felt cool, calm, and relaxed to enjoy our special day. We couldn't have pulled it off without her and with our sanity intact. Thanks so much, Kaiya, you crushed it and we can't recommend you enough :)

  * ### Great choice!

•Verified review

•Angelina•Apr 15, 2025

Kaiya was the PERFECT day-of coordinator for my client's wedding! The minute I met her in person you can tell she is seasoned in this industry and can think quickly on her feet with new information being presented to her. She is extremely professional, and very sweet and kept that same energy throughout the entirety of the wedding day. Your ideal day-of coordinator not only takes care of the little details, but helps runs a smooth timeline, communicates effectively with vendors during a short time frame, and adjusts/pivots as things arise, and that is exactly what Kaiya did and THEN some. I could not recommend Kaiya enough! You and your special day will be in more than great hands with her on your team!

  * ### Kaiya is great!

•Verified review

•Lena•Apr 15, 2025

I had the pleasure of working with Kaiya as our day-of wedding coordinator, and I couldn't have been more impressed. Despite being relatively new to the field, Kaiya showcased professionalism and dedication that rivaled seasoned professionals. From our initial consultation, Kaiya made me feel at ease, listening attentively to my vision and concerns. She was incredibly organized, ensuring every detail was accounted for, and her communication throughout the planning process was impeccable. On the wedding day, Kaiya was a calming presence, handling last- minute changes and unexpected issues with grace and efficiency. Her ability to coordinate with vendors, manage the timeline, and keep everything running smoothly allowed us to fully enjoy our special day without any stress. Kaiya exceeded our expectations, and I highly recommend her services to any couple looking for a reliable and passionate wedding coordinator.

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book your services?

For full service planning, we recommend booking 12–18 months in advance. For partial planning 6-9 months in advance. For day-of coordination, at least 2–3 months before your wedding is ideal.

### What’s the difference between a wedding planner and a day-of coordinator?

A wedding planner helps you with the entire planning process—budgeting, design, timelines, vendors, and more. A day-of coordinator steps in closer to your date to manage logistics and make sure everything runs smoothly on the wedding day.

### What’s the first step to working with you?

Start by reaching out through our contact form or booking a consultation. We’ll chat about your vision, needs, and how we can help bring your dream wedding to life.

### Do you plan events other than weddings?

Yes! While weddings are our specialty, Kaiya Smith Events also plans a variety of celebrations including corporate events, baby showers, rehearsal dinners, farewell brunches, birthdays, and more. If it’s worth celebrating, we’d love to help you make it unforgettable.

### Do you offer flexible pricing or customizable packages?

Yes, we offer payment plans to make investing in your wedding planning more manageable. A deposit is required to secure your date, and the remaining balance can be paid in installments leading up to the event.

### What Venues Have You Worked at?

Montage Healdsburg, Santa Lucia Preserve, Rosewood Sandhill, Bear Flag Farm, The Ritz Carlton Half Moon Bay, Hakone Gardens, Silverado, Pebble Beach, Solage Auberge, Carmel Valley Ranch, Cavallo Point, The University Club SF and many more.
