HEYYY! *waves hands* We are Leandra & Clinton Cunanan, owners and lead videographers of Food & Cake Wedding Films. We are huge advocates for doing exactly what you want on your wedding day. We had the most epic wedding of all time (ask us about it!), but we didn't hire a videographer. And now this why we do what we do. It's the best feeling knowing each one of our couples will be able to relive their wedding day for the rest of their lives. We didn't have that, and now we get to give that to you!

Because pictures can't talk and memories fade away, your wedding day is so much more than posed moments. From all the laughter to the happy tears, open bars and long winded cheers, we are there to capture it all. You won't find a hired camera crew or any outsourced editing here. From the first zoom call to packing up your film box, we handle everything in-house (literally)!

  * ### The BEST of the best!! 

•Verified review

•Megan + T.•Mar 7, 2024

I am so blown away by not only the quality of Clint and Leandra's work as videographers, but also what wonderful people they are! Not even halfway through our first zoom with them to talk about what packages they offer and our vision for the day I knew they were the perfect fit for us! Being with them on the wedding day felt like hanging out with old friends, they were amazing at blending in to the crowd to capture candid moments while also giving us prompts that created some of our favorite memories of the day. They worked so well with our other vendors and I don't think our day would have been complete without them. They are masters at what they do, and also the perfect people to have during a busy and, at times, stressful day (Leandra was able to bussle my dress when no one else could get the loop on the buttons AND snagged me some appetizers when I was resting my feet after the receiving line, she was a lifesaver!) My husband and I both teared up watching our trailer and highlight reel, and then happy cried getting to see our whole ceremony, private vows, speeches, and first dances. I know this is footage we’ll be so happy to look back on in the years to come, not just of my husband and I but of our whole families as well! I'm so happy we found Food Cake, you will not regret hiring this fantastic couple!
