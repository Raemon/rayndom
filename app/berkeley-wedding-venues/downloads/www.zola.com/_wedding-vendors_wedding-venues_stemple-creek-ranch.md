## About this venue

Just five miles from the Pacific Coast, Stemple Creek Ranch is a serene landscape of fields stretching as far as the eye can see. We have many beautiful ceremony sites on our property including a hilltop stand of Eucalyptus, a towering redwood tree, and our beloved red barn. Our classic style barn has rustic charm and an air of country elegance. The large, spacious interior can accommodate groups of all sizes, and has a beautiful outdoor deck overlooking the surrounding West Marin hills. It's the perfect space for celebrating your special day, and dancing the night away.

  * ### Stunning, magical, and unexpected

•Verified review

•Noor A.•Jul 30, 2025

We are absolutely thrilled with our wedding at Stemple Creek. It's a blank slate in many ways, and requires some imagination, but trust your vision! It is worth it. On our wedding day, it was cloudy, on the chillier side for July, and the eucalyptus grove where we had our ceremony was very windy, but all of this just added to the beauty of Stemple Creek and made us all feel like we were in some other time and place. It honestly exceeded our expectations. Our guests were flat out stunned by the venue. Everything, from the grove, to the cocktail hour space, to the bar-shed, to the barn was perfect. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Katie was a super generous and kind host, and her dog Schaeffer is the sweetest. Coby was also very gracious throughout the event. Thank you Stemple Creek!
