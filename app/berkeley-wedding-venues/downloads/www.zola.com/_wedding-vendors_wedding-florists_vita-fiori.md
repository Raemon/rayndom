  * ### Can’t Recommend Johannah at Vita Fiori Enough!!!

•Verified review

•Julia J.•Sep 24, 2025

We are so grateful to have worked with Johannah of Vita Fiori for our wedding! From start to finish, she made the process so easy and stress-free. She provided us with beautifully detailed PDFs that outlined every arrangement, flower choice, and cost breakdown, which gave us so much confidence in the planning process. On the wedding day, every piece she created was stunning—whimsical, thoughtful, and perfectly in line with our color scheme. Johannah incorporated both mine and my husband’s birth month flowers into the bridal bouquet and boutonnière, which made them so personal and meaningful. From the bouquets and boutonnières to the aisle markers, bud vases, candles, and even the greenery for our seating chart, every detail felt intentional and artfully designed. The ceremony altar pieces and bar arrangement were breathtaking focal points that our guests couldn’t stop complimenting. Having her handle both setup and takedown was such a gift—it allowed us to be fully present and enjoy our celebration without worrying about logistics. Johannah truly went above and beyond, and her talent and professionalism shine through in every arrangement. If you’re looking for a florist who combines artistry, organization, and heart, I can’t recommend Vita Fiori enough!

  * ### Still currently in Shock! 

•Verified review

•Linnea S.•Sep 10, 2025

From the moment I reached out to Vita Fiori, I was impressed by their attentive, timely, and sharp communication style. Johannah, was incredibly kind and loving, and truly one of the sweetest souls I've ever met. She took the vision I had in mind and completely transformed it into something even more whimsical and gorgeous than I could have ever imagined. The floral arrangements she created for my wedding were outstanding in both quality and value - the perfect blend of elegance and playfulness that made my special day that much more magical. Johannah even sent me a one-of-a-kind gift after the wedding, which was such a thoughtful and sweet touch. I cannot recommend Vita Fiori highly enough to any couple planning their dream wedding.

  * ### The best florist/ wedding planner in the industry!

•Verified review

•Griffin B.•Sep 5, 2025

Vita Fiori was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding in Crete, Greece. From our first interaction, their communication was efficient, business-like, and considerate, putting us at ease throughout the planning process. The quality of their work was simply perfect - the flowers they created were creative, beautiful, and exactly what we had envisioned for our special day. Vita Fiori made our wedding day so special and we couldn't have done it without their expertise. Literally so amazing, she made our wedding day perfect and we did not have to worry about anything. The flowers were stunning and just what we wanted. We are so grateful to Vita Fiori for contributing to making our wedding day unforgettable.
