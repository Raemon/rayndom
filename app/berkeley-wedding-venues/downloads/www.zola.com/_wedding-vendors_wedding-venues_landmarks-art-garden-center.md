## About this venue

The Landmarks Art & Garden Center, a lovingly renovated historic cottage and garden, offers a unique setting for weddings and special events! Drivers who stream along Richardson Bay on the commute to and from Tiburon have a wonderful panoramic bay view, which sweeps from Sausalito to Strawberry Point and Mt. Tamalpais. A beautiful new addition to that view is the Landmarks Art and Garden Center, a lovingly renovated house and property from Tiburon’s earliest years, that is now a superb setting for weddings and special events. Once you reach this facility, you’re enveloped in another world and sensibility. As you pass the deep green expanse of lawn on your way in, you can picture having your ceremony on it, or perhaps joining your guests for an old-fashioned game of croquet.

## Our event spaces

### Art & Garden Center

If your imagination has been taking you to a quiet, sunny spot with abundant greenery and scenery, you’ll undoubtedly experience a pleasing sense of deja vu when you actually set foot in the Landmarks Art and Garden Center.

The square-acre site, with its commanding vista of Richardson Bay, is a garden composed of four terraces, with the house nestled to one side and a rose arbor on the other. The other star of the Center is the restored farm house, built in the 1870s and once part of a working-class neighborhood in the days when Tiburon was a railroad terminal. The cottage, clad in gray shingles with rough cedar shakes on the roof, features a sun-filled living room that opens to the original kitchen and adjoining sitting area. A small wedding or reception would fit nicely here, surrounded by the rough-hewn charm of the meticulously restored walls and floors. Just outside the kitchen door, there’s a handsomely refurbished farmyard bell that newlyweds’ friends often toll in celebration—another one of the old-fashioned touches that contribute to this facility’s welcoming atmosphere.
