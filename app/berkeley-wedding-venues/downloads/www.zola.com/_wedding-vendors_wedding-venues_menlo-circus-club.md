## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### What is the cost for the use of a room/space for an event?

We have several rooms available for events ranging from 10-800 people. The size of your group and room/space will determine your cost. Rooms can range from $500 - $10,000 depending on several factors.

### What does my set-up fee include?

Our set-up fee includes a 5 hour use of the space you are contracted for. In some instances, i.e. ceremonies, an additional hour may be added to accommodate your event. As long as your event does not exceed our operating hours, you can work with your event manager if you require additional time for your event.

### Do you allow candles or open flame?

Votive candles are included in your room rental fee and can only be used if the flame is one inch below the top of a glass container. Open flames are not allowed or permitted due to fire code restrictions.

### Where should I park?

The Clubhouse has ample parking for you and all of your guests (up to 150 people) as you enter the property. Please take into account that other activities may be going on in other areas of the property, so not all spaces may be available. If your event is over 200 people your Event Manager will work with you to come up with a parking plan.
