Hello! My name is Jasmine.I was born in Colorado but recently last year moved to Texas! I’ve always had a deep passion for photography and art. There’s something magical about capturing little moments,ones that might seem small at first but carry so much emotion. That’s what I love most about being a photographer,freezing those fleeting, heartfelt memories so they can be cherished forever. Photography isn’t just about taking pictures; it’s about telling a story, preserving emotions, and creating something timeless.

What sets me apart as a photographer is my ability to capture the little moments that often go unnoticed,the subtle glances, the quiet laughter, the raw emotions that make a moment truly special. I don’t just take pictures; I tell stories through my lens, creating images that hold deep meaning and genuine emotion. My goal is to make every session feel natural and comfortable, so the true essence of the moment shines through. Photography is more than a job for me it’s my passion, and I pour my heart into every shot.

I can’t even begin to express how grateful I am for everything Jasmine did to make our day so extraordinary. She is such a wonderful photographer and her kindness truly shone through. She was so attentive and helped me stay calm in moments of stress, which I really needed. Her support was invaluable, and I genuinely appreciate all the little things she did to make our day special. I’m so excited to see all the beautiful photos she captured. She has become our family photographer for life! Thank you from the bottom of my heart Jasmine!

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you also offer video services?

No, I prefer focusing on photography only, so you can get the best wedding pictures possible.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 60 to 85 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 3-4 weeks after your wedding. But get a sneak peak within 24 hours!!!

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my photographers and I will also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.
