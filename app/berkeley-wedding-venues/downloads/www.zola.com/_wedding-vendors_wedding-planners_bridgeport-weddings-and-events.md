  * ### Avoid Bridgeport Weddings or lose your money!

•Verified review

•Tammura T.•Nov 27, 2024

It all started out perfect. I hired Bridgeport weddings for day of coordination, which included communication for the month leading up to the wedding. There was good communication between Nia and myself up until the night before the wedding. I got a message from her that she couldn’t fly out which I completely understood. There was something going on with her flight and I felt horrible for her. My message to her was I’m so sorry that she was going through that. I felt awful, but we were all set for the next day so not to worry about us. I spoke with her the day after the wedding and she was going to issue a refund. I checked in a week later to see the status of the refund because I hadn’t had any communication about it and she said she sent it and that was that, but this was her first time ever issuing a refund so she was gonna look into it. I apologize and said I would just wait for the refund. Here we are now over a month later no refund, my messages are bouncing back from the email address we communicated on the entire entire time and my bank cannot dispute them because we’re out of the timeline. Over 900 gone without any recourse because I trusted in and believed that this company and Nia did what they said they were going to do.

  * ### Scam - avoid this company

•Verified review

•Jenifer S.•Nov 17, 2024

Bridgeport Weddings and Events was the most stressful part of my wedding day- because they didn’t show up. I had interviewed several day-of coordinators and had been excited to work with Nia. I filled out an extensive online form in the months leading up to the day and had a call with her the week of the wedding, where she assured me not to worry about anything, as she does this all the time. On the day of our wedding, I got a text message from a number I didn’t recognize around 10am (the time she was supposed to show up) saying that she had been in a car accident in Las Vegas, but she was going to go to the airport after the police left. My family and friends scrambled to set everything up before our 1pm wedding ceremony and keep the day running. My mom ended up taking out the trash at the end of the night, which is exactly what I was trying to avoid by hiring a day-of coordinator. The next day, she texted me that she had been in the hospital overnight, but would take care of our account when she got back to the office. I waited until after our honeymoon to reach out, assuming maybe she didn’t got back to work right away. However, it seems that she has ghosted me, blocking my email and not answering phone calls or text messages. Now that it’s been 6 weeks with no answer, I feel completely scammed and regret ever hiring this company.

Our wedding came out so beautiful. You set it off and had everyone posting and talking about our wedding. Thank you for flying in and making it happen. The planning process was easy and simple and you kept the day a day to remember.
