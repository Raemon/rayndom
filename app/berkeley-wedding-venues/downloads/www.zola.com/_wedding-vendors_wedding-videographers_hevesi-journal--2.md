Hello, my name is David, and I am a wedding filmmaker based in Atlanta, Georgia. While I call Atlanta home, I love to travel and capture beautiful stories across various destinations. My passion lies in crafting films that truly reflect the authenticity of each couple, bringing their unique story to life. Traveling allows me to explore new places, helping me find the perfect settings to enhance every couple's big day. I look forward to creating unforgettable wedding films that showcase the emotions, moments, and love that make each wedding day truly special.

I tell stories that are authentic to you, creating a unique experience for every couple I work with. My goal is to craft films that reflect the genuine connection between you and your partner, capturing every special moment in a way that is personal and meaningful. I take the time to understand your story and your vision, ensuring that the final film is not only beautiful but also a true representation of your unique journey. By focusing on the details that matter most to you, I create a wedding film that will stand the test of time, preserving your memories for years to come.

## Frequently asked questions

9 Answers

Ask them a question

### Can anyone else see our wedding video?

No, we’ll send a private link to share your final wedding video with you. Only people with that link will be able to see your video.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Once you know your wedding date, we recommend reaching out as soon as possible about our availability. We film a limited number of weddings every year to ensure our couples receive the highest quality service, so our calendar typically fills up months in advance.

### Do you film elopements?

Absolutely. Reach out anytime to ask about our special pricing for elopements! Please note your elopement must have fewer than 10 total guests.

### Who will edit our wedding video?

All footage we film is edited in-house by our incredible editing team.

### Do you film destination weddings?

Definitely! While we are based in Atlanta, we travel all over the country and world to capture weddings, elopements, and other special life moments on film.

### How many videographers should we book for our wedding?

All of our wedding packages include one videographer as standard. However, for weddings with over 100 guests, we recommend adding a second videographer to ensure we capture every special moment from multiple perspectives. All packages over 10 hours will include a second videographer automatically.

### Do you have insurance?

Yes! We’re happy to send a copy of our certificate of liability insurance to your venue or any other vendors upon request.

### Can you still film our outdoor wedding if it rains on our wedding day?

Unfortunately, we cannot film outdoors in the rain or other inclement weather conditions like snow and hail. Depending on the set up of your day, we may be able to make accommodations as needed.

### Can you do a same-day edit?

We believe high quality products are not rushed, so at this time we do not offer same day editing as to continue to provide the highest quality.
