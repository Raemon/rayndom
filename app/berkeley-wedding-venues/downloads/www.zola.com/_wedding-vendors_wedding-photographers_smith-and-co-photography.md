•Verified review

•Martha O.•Jan 15

From the first time we met with Smith and Co. Photography, we knew we were in good hands. Their communication was fantastic, consistent, and always honest, putting us at ease throughout the entire wedding planning process. The quality of their work is incredible. They have a unique, candid style that captured all the special, intimate moments of our day in a way that feels so authentic and personal. The day-of coordination was seamless, and they blended in effortlessly to capture every detail without ever being intrusive. We are thrilled with the final photos and couldn't recommend Smith and Co. more highly to any couple looking for an exceptional wedding photography experience.

•Job M.•Jul 18, 2024

Elizabeth was wonderful to work with. From the very first email to zoom calls, and our in person meeting at the venue. They made the process very easy for us, and super helpful with her created day of timeline, and the documents of family order and her experience to give proper direction on the day of. We were absolutely amazed with the quality of photos and the quick turn around time for sneak peaks. We were so pleased with their willingness to capture the special moments to us and the constant attention throughout the day to ensure all events were captured. We look forward to working with her in future family photos sessions.

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 13 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame. I do on occasion have miscellaneous dates become available- don't be afraid to reach out last minute as well!

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Yes! I have several wonderful second shooters who are part of our & Co. We all use the same gear and have worked together for years. If you are interested in adding a second shooter I'm happy to bring them along!

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

I am just as excited as you are - so you will most likely get sneak peeks either the same evening as your wedding or by the next day! My turnaround time varies by season for the full gallery. Typically, your gallery will be delivered about 2-5 weeks after your wedding.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 12 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.

### How many pictures will we get?

Typical wedding galleries range from 250-600 fully edited photos, keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors surrounding your day. I deliver as many photos as possible so you have different options and angles throughout the day. We can nail down an estimate during planning as everything is tailored to you!

### Do you also offer video services?

We have started to offer video options. We have a 2-3 minute social media highlight reel and a 9+ minute full length film option as well. We also provide you with the full, unedited vows and toasts to cherish forever as well!
