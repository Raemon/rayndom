  * ### Paige Events Delivers!

•Verified review

•gail d.•Dec 2, 2025

I hired Paige Fox at Paige Events to help plan my daughter’s wedding In Carmel, CA. I live on the East coast and my daughter and fiancé live in Washington State. It was a relatively short engagement with 4/5 months to plan. I really needed someone to help locate and vet vendors and serve as a day of event coordinator. Paige and her team did an amazing job! She is known and respected by quality vendors (ie flowers, transportation, photography, etc.) which made me feel confident with whom we hired. This also made it easy to communicate and resolve any issues in a timely fashion. Paige also helped with the many smaller details from picking up printed materials at FedEx to giving advice on selections at the reception venue. I valued her opinion. She was always easily accessible via phone, text or email. On top of all that, Paige has a wonderful personality and was a pleasure to work with. I would 100% recommend Paige Fox to anyone needing event planning services.

If you’re getting married, you have to book Paige Events! I got married in September 2025 — one of the busiest wedding months, especially in California — and Paige Events went above and beyond to help me plan the most perfect wedding weekend. They are incredibly organized, kind, and helpful throughout the entire process. They always made sure my opinions were heard and offered thoughtful options that perfectly matched my vision. My wedding had 300 guests, and even with that many people, the day felt completely seamless. I’m someone who usually worries about timelines, but I didn’t have to think twice about where I needed to be or what was happening next — they were always two steps ahead, anticipating every detail. Their vendor recommendations were spot-on, and every Zoom call with the team was a joy. They genuinely listened, made me feel heard, and always left me laughing by the end of each meeting. As organized as I am, I truly don’t think my wedding would have come together anywhere near as perfectly without them. Paige Events is an amazing team, and I can’t recommend them enough to anyone looking for planners they can truly trust to make their wedding dreams come to life.

  * ### The dream team!

•Verified review

•Lisa•Nov 5, 2025

Paige Events was a dream to work with. Not only were the team professional and detail-oriented, but they were also kind and thoughtful throughout the whole process. While the planning team is one I rely on heavily as a venue, they curated amazing vendors as part of the extended team. I found Paige (there are two of them; I worked with the Paige who is not the owner, but another planner on the team) to be fun to work with, accommodating, and very thorough. On the day of the wedding, EVERYTHING went off without a hitch. When you're thinking of wedding planning and all the 'what ifs, ' THIS is the outcome you are looking for. A caring team of vendors to support each stint of the timeline for the day, while accounting for any possibilities. The couple was cared for, supported, and celebrated. I have seen many, many events here at the Los Altos History Museum, and I can tell you that this event was one of the ones that was the most expertly managed. If you are looking for a wedding planner, you can feel more than confident that you are in good hands with the Paige Events team.

  * ### We couldn't have done it without Paige A!

•Verified review

•Michelle E.•Oct 22, 2025

We cannot say enough wonderful things about Paige A. and the team at Paige Events. From our very first conversation, Paige just got our vision and helped us bring it to life. She was a lifesaver when it came to finding vendors who fit our budget AND our style for our Bernardus Lodge wedding. Whenever we felt overwhelmed, she'd jump in with guidance that always pointed us in the right direction. We planned virtually the entire wedding from across the country, and Paige made planning feel so manageable. Day-of, she was an absolute rockstar. She had every detail under control, kept all our vendors in sync, and even made sure we actually sat down to eat—something we definitely would have forgotten to do! Several of our vendors told us how much they loved working with her. Oh, and a fun bonus: we discovered we're both UCLA alums (go Bruins!), which made the whole experience so much more special. We simply don't think we could have pulled off our wedding weekend without Paige. If you're looking for a planner who's talented, organized, genuinely kind, and truly invested in your day, stop looking—you've found her.
