Through my lens, I capture the beauty of this tropical paradise and beyond, striving to create emotive and captivating images. With recognition as an Airbnb "Once in a Lifetime" Experience Host and on USA Today's 10 Best for my work on The Vida Mia, I bring a unique perspective to my photography. Collaborating closely with clients, I aim to translate their vision into captivating visuals, whether it's a destination wedding or unforgettable engagements and proposals. I believe in the power of storytelling through photography to inspire positive change and deeper appreciation for our world.

Originally from Coastal Virginia, I made the life-changing decision to move to Hawaii in 2016. Since then, living in this breathtaking paradise has not only brought me closer to nature but has also helped me discover more about myself through the ocean, mountains, and the vibrant local community.

Jasmine was an absolute pleasure to work with for our special day. From the moment we first reached out, she was prompt in her communication, clearly knowledgeable about her craft, and incredibly understanding of our needs and preferences. Her attention to detail and thoughtful approach shone through in the amazing final photos, which beautifully captured all the special moments of our day. Jasmine made us feel comfortable and relaxed throughout the process, and was incredibly accommodating to ensure we got all the shots we wanted. The whole experience was just wonderful, and the pictures turned out great - we will cherish them forever.

  * ### Truly an enjoyable experience!

Jasmine was an absolute pleasure to work with. She took initiative to get to know my fiancé and I prior to our photo shoot, offered excellent photograph location options tailored to our unique interests, and made the experience fun and stress-free. Our photographs are stunning and I can’t stop smiling every time I look at them! Thank you for providing us with pictures and memories to last a lifetime!

## Frequently asked questions

2 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 6-13 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them. I am also a member of the Professional Photographers of America Association.
