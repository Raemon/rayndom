  * ### Fantastic Florist

•Verified review

•Hannah•Dec 17, 2024

Elizabeth and her husband were awesome to work with (they make a great team!). Flowers were a big part of our wedding and they met every request I had (flower crown, arch way, bouquets). They helped us re-use a lot of the flowers from the ceremony at the reception. All of the flowers were fresh and top quality. They even put up with my 100 Google Docs for planning. Our wedding would not have been as beautiful without them!

  * ### Perfect wedding flowers!

•Verified review

•Natalie•Dec 16, 2024

We used Petal Town Flowers for our wine country wedding and were so happy with the results. I got multiple compliments that my bouquet was the prettiest that people had ever seen, the bridesmaid bouquets were smaller but matched perfectly, and they even made a special bouquet to go around the neck of our "wedding alpaca" dressed as the bride :) The guests loved the centerpieces, and the flowers on our arch were beautiful as well. The colors were just what I requested and everything went seamlessly the day of the wedding. My husband and I would both highly recommend Petal Town!

Martin and Elizabeth are fantastic to work with. They are extremely flexible and willing to work with your vision and budget. I work with them several times a year and always suggest them to my clients. Their work is beautiful! They are also really quick to respond.

  * ### Always Fresh and Beyond Beautiful

•Verified review

•Mountain House Estate•Aug 7, 2020

Petal Town Flowers - Wine Country Weddings has provided florals for quite a few weddings at Mountain House Estate. We're always pleased when a couple tells us they've hired Petal Tows Flowers because we know that Martin and Elizabeth will be on time and provide a beautiful compliment to the wedding. We've seen a lovely variety of styles - from simple to complex - and they've all been stunning.

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you have a minimum spend for weddings?

No! We love to be a part of all celebrations, from elopements to grand events. There is no minimum on the flowers ordered, or to have your flowers delivered.

### Do you offer packages?

No! All weddings will be customized to your specific needs. We believe every bride and groom is unique, with their own style, personality, color palette and budget. Every wedding we do is custom created to your specifications, whether big or small, traditional or bohemian, colorful or romantic white.

### Do you handle flower breakdown after the ceremony?

Yes! Our services include (for a fee) delivery, setup and breakdown/strike depending on your needs. We can even wait on site to relocate flowers from one area to another if you'd like.

### Can I see a mockup of proposed flowers?

Not really. Since most wedding flowers are special, they are special order as well. We can show you photo samples, or even take photos and send from the market to display different types of flowers, colors and such. However, in order to create a true mock up, we'd have to order all your flowers in advance, which isn't cost effective.

### How do I get started with a Quote?

We typically start you off with a link to our online Wedding Flower Questionnaire to give us some detail about your style, color palette, your venue, the elements you are looking for etc. You can attach photos or links to your Pinterest. From there, we will create a first draft quote as a starting point. Then we can either schedule a consultation, or keep emailing as we refine your quote.

### How far in advance should we order our wedding flowers?

Venues book up quickly. Though we can accommodate "last minute" weddings if our schedule permits, it's best to secure your date as far as a year in advance. A 25% deposit will secure your date, but you can still continue to add, change, refine your order up until one week before your wedding date. No need to feel pressured to have all the answers one year in advance :-) We know things change.
