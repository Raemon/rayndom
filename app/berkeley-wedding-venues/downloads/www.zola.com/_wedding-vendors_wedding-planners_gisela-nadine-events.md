Gisela Nadine Events & Design is a full-service planning and design house specializing in bespoke events uniquely tailored to match your individual personality, style, and love story. We celebrate people, and create experiences that embody you as a couple. When guests walk in, we want them to see YOUR wedding - not just any other event.

We phase out the planning process to focus on one big thing at a time and ensure your event is pieced together thoughtfully and intentionally - without wasting money, and most importantly, without treating you like just another number. We've noticed that often times, planners have signature designs or trademark styles that we can always spot from any photo. We see a certain seating chart or a certain font and immediately know the planner of that wedding. Although some may enjoy having this "trademark," we strive to create uniquely individualized designs with every client to avoid your wedding looking like anyone else's.

  * ### Gisela Is a Dream Planner!

•Verified review

•Anna R.•Feb 3, 2025

I cannot say enough wonderful things about Gisela! From start to finish, she went above and beyond to make our wedding in Palos Verdes absolutely perfect. Her attention to detail, creativity, and ability to bring our vision to life exceeded all expectations. From the very beginning, Gisela was organized, responsive, and truly listened to what we wanted. She handled everything seamlessly—coordinating with vendors, managing the timeline, and ensuring every little detail was flawless. One thing that truly impressed us was how thorough she was with the final budget the venue sent over. She caught discrepancies we would have never noticed, got us money back, and even managed to add extra late-night bites within our total budget! On the day of the wedding, I was able to fully enjoy every moment because I knew we were in the best hands. What truly sets Gisela apart is her passion and dedication. She treated our wedding as if it were her own, going the extra mile to ensure everything was beautiful and stress-free. Our guests are still raving about how magical the day was, and we owe so much of that to her hard work! If you're looking for a wedding planner who is professional, experienced, and genuinely cares about making your day special, look no further. I highly recommend Gisela—she is an absolute dream to work with!

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### How many weddings have you planned, and what are they like? Any specialties?

I (Gisela) have planned over 100 weddings + many other smaller events over the years from the day I started as my own entity until now. Prior to Gisela Nadine Events & Design, I was a lead coordinator for another planner in Los Angeles. Each wedding has a unique story but our goal is to create experiences celebrating people. YOU are the main event and we reflect that in every experience we curate. Our goal is always that your guests walk into the wedding and see YOU and YOUR love story - not just any other wedding. Every couple is different and it's important your special day reflects that.

### Who will we be working with? How many associates are on your wedding day team?

I am the lead planner and designer for every wedding and I only take on one wedding per week/weekend, with a max of 24 weddings per year (average of 2 per month). This allows me to give my attention to each client at the level they need and expect, and not overwork myself at the same time. Our wedding day team consists of 2-3 associates for most weddings however additional associates are always available should we feel necessary. My associate coordinators have all worked with me for several years and are very familiar with the style of planning (and coordinating) that we operate under. Loyalty is big for me and my team!

### How much time should we expect to spend with you?

This completely varies from couple to couple. For some of our full-service clients, we chat every single day whether via text, call, email, or in-person meetings. Alternatively, especially in between planning phases when we can all take a breather for a period of time, it may be a couple weeks until we touch base - and that's okay! The amount of time we spend together can also heavily depend on the level of production we're working with for your wedding. Custom builds, private estates or blank canvas venues will take extra time compared to a hotel or event venue that provides so much in-house.

### Do you take on multiple weddings in a day or weekend?

Never! We only take on one wedding per weekend, or per week (sometimes we have weekday weddings!). Unless it's due to a rescheduled event already under contract, we will NOT take on any other events the same week or weekend as your wedding. This allows us to fully focus on all our clients and ensure we're fully available to you on the week of your wedding. We also limit the number of weddings we take on to 24 max each year.
