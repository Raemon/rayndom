Every couple has a story, and at Brownie Photography & Production, I live to tell those stories. As an award-winning photographer and filmmaker, I focus on the things that make you, well, you. Your journey, values, and culture are what I aim to highlight in every photo and film. I believe in the power of human connection and take pride in getting to know you personally; my team and I are committed to documenting the moments that define you.

Instead of offering standard packages, we build custom collections designed specifically for your day, your priorities, and your vision. From photography and videography coverage to heirloom albums and rehearsal dinner add-ons, every detail is thoughtfully chosen to serve your story best. After reaching out, we’ll schedule a consultation to walk through your plans, your values, and everything that matters most. From there, we’ll curate a proposal that reflects exactly what you need — and nothing you don’t. This is about more than just booking another vendor. This is about preserving your story with the depth and artistry it deserves.

  * ### The Best Experience & The Best Photos

•Verified review

•Erika & R.•Oct 21, 2025

We met with various photographers in the early wedding planning stages, and we knew immediately we'd found the person to capture our special day after meeting Ashley. Not only had her photos caught our attention because of their documentarian style and keen eye, but her demeanor of warmth and comfort were exactly what we were looking to surround ourselves with on our wedding day. We received a sneak peek of our photos much faster than we had anticipated. To say they met our expectations and were beautiful would be an understatement. Not only did she make posing for photos feel natural and comfortable, but she somehow managed to capture moments we didn't even know were possible! It was absolutely wonderful to see images of our loved ones genuinely enjoying themselves at our wedding, especially because we didn't have the chance to observe it all in the moment. Thank you, Ashley, for capturing our day in the most beautiful way possible!

  * ### Exceptional photographer!

•Verified review

•Wendy C.•Aug 21, 2025

Exceptional photographer who worked closely with my daughter to capture every moment of her and her grooms most special day. Ashley was so helpful and knows her craft. The photos came out better than we could have imagined. Her communication, work ethic and genuine desire to make the couple and all that surrounded them was beyond wonderful.

My now-husband (!!) and I cannot speak highly enough of Ashley. We did our engagement pictures with her and very soon after booked her for our wedding. Not only is she just such a kind and cool person, she's also an incredible photographer with an amazing ability to capture exactly the essence you're looking for. Even if you can't describe exactly what you want, Ashley can make it happen. She sees the beauty in all the little moments that you can easily miss on such a busy day. Working with Ashley was seamless; she's a great communicator and worked closely with us at each step of the process. We got so many sneak peeks back within 48 hours of our wedding which was super exciting, and it's going to be hard to pick which ones to frame!

  * ### Brownie Photogrpahy Dreams come true

•Verified review

•Isabella M.•Dec 13, 2024

Ashley is actually the best photographer known to man. She took our elopement photos in Las Vegas as well as our wedding photos locally in TX. I wanted more of a candid and vintage vibe with our photos and boy did Ashley deliver! And on top of that she makes you so comfortable and produces such a fun environment for pictures. My husband and I are super awkward and goofy and she was able to still make us look like a million bucks. Our only complaint at the end of the day is that we wish she could follow us everywhere and take our pictures all the time!! I couldn't suggest Brownie Photography more to any couple who is looking for pictures to cherish for all the years to come.

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability. Many couples start planning 12-24 months in advance so reach out ASAP to see if I have your date open!

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Depending on the wedding package you choose, I may have 1 - 2 extra shooters with me. It doesn't cost extra if it is included in your package!

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding. If we are in a busy season it can range from 6-8 weeks and I will let you know if your wedding takes place during a busy season. Nonetheless, you will always receive some sneak peeks within 48 hours of the wedding!
