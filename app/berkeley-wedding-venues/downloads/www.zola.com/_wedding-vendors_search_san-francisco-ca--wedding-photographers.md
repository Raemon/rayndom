I started shooting photos and video in Greece, and since moving to the US, I have dedicated myself to shooting weddings, elopements and engagements. I love being able to capture the love that my couples have for each other and the unique energy each couple has. I am always down to shoot in new locations and find the best place for my shoots!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Enea and Hayley are truly exceptional. From our engagement shoot to the big day, they went above and beyond to capture every moment with heart, artistry, and professionalism. Enea photographed our wedding while Hayley worked her magic on video—and together, they delivered memories we will treasure forever. Our photos are absolutely stunning, and the video trailer full ceremony edit brought us to tears (in the best way!). They took the time to get to know us, making everything feel personal and natural. Not only are they incredibly talented and creative, but they’re also fun, dependable, and a joy to be around. They brought a calming energy, kept things on schedule, and even added a drone to the mix—giving us breathtaking aerial shots we didn’t even know we needed! They both have such a natural eye for detail and storytelling. We couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out. Truly, we cannot recommend Enea and Hayley enough. If you’re lucky enough to have the chance to work with them, do it. You’ll be so glad you did.”Lorenzo & J., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/c0cafdc6-0176-40f2-8eba-1037c10328f4?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/enea-strora-photography-and-videography)

We loved our photographer Percy. He was incredible, and so helpful. He came with several cameras and valued all of our ideas, and when we became stumped he offered ideas for us to try as well. He was very professional, kind, caring, and always on top of the game taking photos. Towards the end of our night he started to put the camera away and brought it back out to catch a few final moments. He was on top of responding to all questions before, during, and after. He took photos of me and my husband before the ceremony and got some wonderful shots (it was a 95 outside wedding so this was much appreciated because we all had some sweat on our faces). But before we got Percy and our booking process with eivans it was super simple, and just an overall great experience.”Julia K., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/861298ad-99f5-4c25-90e5-632ba4daff5a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/eivan-s-photo-video)

Love Knot Photography 5.0 San Francisco, CA

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $3,000 

Hi, I’m Isaac. In my world, light is everything. The cool ambient hues at dawn, hinting at what the day may bring. Golden sun rays catching particles through a tree as friends gathers to celebrate. A Cotton candy sunset peppered by patio string-lights as a DJ plays my favorite song. We all have timeless memories logged in our minds. For me, they are based in a language of light. As a wedding photographer, this deep connection to special lighting helps me produce dynamic visual stories of romance, personality and beauty.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“A few things that stood out the most about Isaac were how responsive he was, how he was able to accommodate to our budget, and how he took pictures from angles and views that turned out great on the photos. As a couple with demanding careers, I much appreciated how quickly Isaac was with replying to emails. We had a pretty tight budget, and Isaac was able to offer us a package that landed pretty close to our budget and only had the items that we needed the most (mini engagement photoshoot for the website and wedding day). Our ask for him was to get some candid shots as we feel pretty awkward in front of the camera. I personally think that the wedding day pictures came out more naturally because of the setting being surrounded with friends and families, and Isaac and Sushen did a great job capturing the candid moments beautifully. Isaac even had an idea for me to pose by climbing up a wooden stair ladder for a shot that I honestly wasn't sure how it was going to turn out while doing it, but it ended up turning out beautiful and magazine-like in addition to other ones that he asked us to pose for. Isaac put together a behind the scenes video that also showed the reactions of guests to our photo place cards before we had entered the reception area, and this was lovely in that we got to see our guests' reactions that we weren't able to see.”Rafy, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/c08a0a6d-4be1-4bcc-8862-b11731c8d945?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/love-knot-photography)

Ron and Trinity Studios 5.0 San Francisco, CA

  * Starts at $3,300 

Clean. Simple. Minimal. Keeping a candid nature in capturing the rare and truest emotions of our couples. We believe that itself is perfection. The sight of a simple, yet bizarre snapshot of priceless moments makes it best and natural.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“My husband and I feel so lucky to have found Ron and Trinity and to have booked them for our engagement and wedding photos. We had a short timeframe to plan our wedding (5 months). On top of that, we were juggling a lot in our personal lives. After experiencing a loss in the family, we had to reschedule our engagement session. Ron and Trinity were so kind and were flexible in rescheduling. When the day of the engagement session finally arrived, we were a bit nervous. Neither of us had taken professional photos before so posing didn’t feel natural. Ron immediately made us feel comfortable and then we knew we were in good hands. Fast forward to the wedding day: I was waiting inside the car while my spouse, our family and our guests were arriving and getting settled in the church. Ron and Trinity came to the car to greet me before the ceremony. It meant a lot that they took the time to check in on me. A true reflection of their kindness. Our wedding was in November and although the weather and lighting made photos a bit challenging, they still managed to improvise some nice shots after sunset. We even took photos in the busy street outside our venue. Ron and Trinity literally watched each other’s backs as cars passed by, and it was amazing to see how seamlessly they work as a team. After the event, Ron and Trinity sent us our photos surprisingly quickly! We were so excited to see them. The photos were beautiful and we loved the quality. Our family loved the quality so much that another family member now wants to book them for their future event. Thank you so much, Ron and Trinity. We appreciate your kindness and your talent. We recommend Ron and Trinity to all future wedding couples!”Melissa S., a month ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/ron-and-trinity-studios)

Apollo Fotografie {Fine Art Wedding Photo & Video} 5.0 San Francisco, CA

  * Fine art style
  * Starts at $3,775 
  * Offer

We’re Apollo Fotografie. When it comes to visual storytelling, we don’t miss a beat. We prioritize organization, punctuality, and beauty so your wedding day looks better than your dreams. At Apollo, inclusivity is one of our core values, and our couples come from all backgrounds. We know that not everyone is comfortable in front of the camera, and we’re here to help. All of our photographers use prompts and suggestions to encourage natural interactions for a less “scripted” feel.“If you are looking for an engagement and wedding photography / videography team, Apollo Fotografie is the one for you. Truly the best wedding photographer in San Francisco and in the overall Bay Area!! From our engagement shoots to our actual wedding day, the team was nothing short of amazing. When we were searching for a photo / video team, we wanted a team that was incredibly knowledgeable about cultural, Indian Hindu weddings - we looked at various portfolios, and Apollo’s portfolio stood out to us the most! We first contacted the team in August, and every single one of our communications with Liv was professional, fun, honest, engaging, and comfortable. It was like speaking with a close friend - Liv made us both feel incredibly comfortable and excited for our big day! I had to apologize to her several times for bugging her with so many questions - but she always responded quickly and transparently!! It was truly a blessing, as other vendors we were interviewing for photography were not as communicative! From then on, we knew Apollo was the team for us. Leading up to the wedding, we worked very closely with Andra. Andra is so wonderful, easy-going, and fun. Speaking with Andra on our numerous calls to discuss our vision was like speaking with a close friend as well. Our wedding calls the week of were incredibly helpful - Andra was incredibly detailed in making sure she understood which shots we wanted, going over timelines and visions with us, and ensuring that we can relax while they take care of everything and make everyone and everything look beautiful. On our wedding day, the entire team was ON TIME (I say this in caps as being on time on a tight deadline is truly important), incredibly friendly, and made us both feel very very very comfortable in our own skin. Andra, Josh, and Alexa were truly truly fantastic, professional, knew all the right angles, and were able to adjust on the fly (which is what you need in in a photo video team). The entire team had incredible vision and had such an eye for detail, knew how to pose to make it look less awkward, were cracking jokes to keep us at ease (one funny moment was when my wife and I were doing our first look, our priest and one of my close friends walked by, and they suggested doing a first look with them as well :) ) but also captured such natural, loving, fun moments of us and our family. Further, literally 2 days after our wedding, Andra sent us the most amazing sneak peeks we have ever seen. My wife and I were absolutely shocked at how beautiful the pictures came out - everyone looked so natural and loving. Further, the artistic vision as I mentioned above was clearly present in these pictures!!! Overall, I highly highly recommend Apollo Fotografie for your photo and video needs!! I promise you, you will not be disappointed.”Nikhil R., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/1f652007-cbe5-4f5f-86fb-a94161f549a9?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/apollo-fotografie-fine-art-wedding-photo-video)

Cassie Valente Photography 5.0 San Francisco, CA

  * Fine art style
  * Starts at $9,750 

My name is Cassie and I am a hybrid film + digital photographer, completely fascinated by the human story and the parts of it that we all share. My aim is to tell the story of your love and laughter through images that are timeless and intentional. I believe in storytelling through details, emotional portraits, and finding those quiet moments in the midst of celebration. I love capturing real moments that help my couples remember how they felt on their wedding day, through the lens of my own airy and dreamy style.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From the moment we started working with Cassie, it felt like we were reconnecting with an old friend. Cassie is so thoughtful, patient, and funny- and we got to experience that multiple times when we connected with her for our photography. We truly believe that her vision and personality is what makes her photos feel so authentic and filled with light love. As awkward people anxious about taking photos, we were so relieved how Cassie made us feel comfortable from the beginning of our engagement session. She was able to somehow fade into the background, while also guiding us and capturing genuine moments. We loved that photo session so much that we ended up hiring her for our welcome dinner as well! Cassie was so easy to work with leading up to the wedding, making sure to get a list of our important shots ahead of the wedding while working closely with our planner to make sure there was a clear schedule. This meant that we could be as present as possible on our wedding day. On the big day, Cassie honestly felt more like a part of the wedding rather than simply a vendor. She knew how to make everyone comfortable, made sure the bridesmaids and groomsmen were having fun, and made the day feel natural for us. We got all of the wedding photos we wanted, and managed to even be AHEAD of schedule so we got to spend more time at our cocktail hour!!! Cassie’s photos capture the full range of emotions on the wedding day, because she’s able to connect deeply with her couples and understand what is important to them. Her style was something we gravitated to as we wanted a photographer who would not simply chronicle our event, but also capture the small details and genuine emotions that we might miss during the day. For both the engagement shoot and our wedding weekend, Cassie promptly delivered sneak peek highlights within a couple of days, and the full album within her initial estimate (8 weeks). She managed to capture the full essence of the day. Everytime we look at those photos, they bring us right back to those moments and feelings. We are so lucky and thankful to have had Cassie as our photographer. Hire her for your wedding! You will not regret it!!”Kirsten, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4eeb82bc-6ff8-470d-b405-37e1d8ae85c9?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/cassie-valente-photography)

Roberta Nicole Photography 5.0 San Francisco, CA

  * Fine art style
  * Starts at $10,000 

Luxury wedding photography in California and worldwide... You want your photos to be as unique as you are. You want photos that capture the intimacy and emotion of your day. I have spent the past decade developing my approach to wedding photography, learning how to be unobtrusive, when to take the lead, and when to take step back and anticipate the moment. The resulting experience is one that allows you to be in the moment. The resulting images are authentic, beautiful and timeless.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Roberta is nothing short of AMAZING. The quality of her work speaks for itself, but working with her is just as impressive! She's extremely personable, so easy to work with, and makes you feel right at home in front of the camera. She really takes the time to get to know her clients to provide the shots they desire most. Not to mention she can roll with the punches! Between the location for our engagement shoot being under maintenance, to my husband never being available for meetings, to an overly windy wedding day - none of it phased her and she was more than accommodating. We received all of our photos in what felt like no time at all and the website she uses for her album design and printing is extremely user friendly! We couldn't have picked a better photographer to capture our big day and plan to continue to use her for all our future photo needs :)”Stephanie & R., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/roberta-nicole-photography)

Jazmín Solano Photography 5.0 San Francisco, CA

  * Photojournalistic style

Artistic storytelling for the fun, kind and adventurous. Hi friend! :) I'm your neighborhood artist, goofy empath, & lover of dogs and human beans. (Name is pronounced Hasmeen, kinda like jalapeño) My goal is to be a source of joy and vulnerability in your life while helping you feel grounded on your big day and ~even more~ grateful for the life you live and the love you choose. ![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Jazmin was such an amazing photographer during our wedding. She went above and beyond SO many times, it blew me away. From agreeing to do our engagement photoshoot on a stormy cold, rainy day, to bringing specialized unique props for us to use. She continued to blow me away with her dedication to being exceptional and so friendly, sweet, and easygoing. She made us feel comfortable in front of the camera, and the photos were exceptional. She advertises herself as your BFF, and it really feels like it. You can tell she cares about her clients. On our wedding day, she also excelled, and we have beautiful photos, as well as film, and we just finalized our photo album with pictures from our engagement shoot as well as wedding. Jazmin included special shots I asked for such as a group photo, and artsy shots with bubbles in the forest. She was our favorite vendor hands down. They say the photographer should be one of the few vendors you splurge on, and we are SO happy we did. It was 100% worth every penny and more. I will recommend her to any of my friends getting married in the future.”Leann J., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/3a481314-0888-44f3-897a-dbc4f837b92f?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/jazmin-solano-photography)

Jasmine Lee Photography 5.0 San Francisco, CA

Jasmine Lee is a destination wedding and lifestyle photographer residing in San Francisco, California. She is devoted to discerning couples and individuals that value the quality of crafting artistic and timeless imagery they will cherish for a lifetime.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“If you’re looking for a photographer, stop your search right now — Jasmine is simply the best. She was referred to us by a close friend with impeccable taste, and wow… she exceeded every expectation. Our wedding came together in less than two months (which was chaos in itself) and on top of that, she had to deal with two stressed-out gays — but somehow, Jasmine made the entire process effortless. She is incredibly flexible, knowledgeable, and just brings this calm, confident energy that instantly puts you at ease. I was lucky enough to have her shoot our wedding ceremony and I still can’t get over how amazing the photos turned out. Every shot looks straight out of a movie — I honestly don’t know how she does it. She’s detail-oriented, organized, and has this eye for capturing the little moments that matter most. After seeing how beautiful our wedding photos were (which we’ll cherish forever), I asked her to photograph my post-bachelor party — and of course, she delivered again. Beyond her insane talent, Jasmine is just a joy to be around. So easy to work with, so responsive, and she makes everyone feel comfortable. Hiring her is not just hiring a photographer — it’s an investment in your memories. I’ll be recommending her to all my friends and family. She’s outstanding.”Daniel A., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/b3645413-643b-4be2-865c-f2c0dd1bc7af?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/jasmine-lee-photography)

When we received our photos (after just a few short weeks!), we were absolutely stunned by the quality and emotion in every shot. Each image feels like a favorite, and we can’t wait to look back on them for years to come.

From the initial conversation to the actual day. She had great communication and it was also awesome to see her portfolio grow while we were waiting for our own special day. Annalee was super professional and sweet to work with. She handled all the chaos of our wedding very well and I super appreciate that she was able to take control of getting the shots when things were confusing and overwhelming. It was actually really nice to be directed when theres so much going on! In regards to her work, she has an excellent eye for framing and beautiful color grading. Her vibes come off as someone who really cares about their craft, as well as you, the client! We got our photos back about a month after and feel that literally every shot is perfect. There's a fantastic mix of behind the scenes, candids, staged etc. Our photos just feel very authentic and personal. These photos really help us relive the day (best day ever!)

Courtney & Jackson are wedding, elopement & family photographers based in San Francisco, California but available for travel worldwide. We go wherever love takes you. Photoflood Studio is a wife + husband team from San Francisco, California. We are wedding photographers servicing NorCal to SoCal and beyond. Photoflood Studio specializes in wedding, engagement, and family photography. We aim to photograph life + love through an honest documentary approach. Our wedding, engagement and family photography is inspired by the beautiful wilderness, the culture of our coastal cities, and wherever you call home.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Whether you decide to have a big or small wedding, finding the perfect photographer is an essential detail. We stumbled across Courtney’s portfolio and fell in love with her story telling, but soon discovered that we loved working with her even more! Our initial meeting felt so comfortable, and her energy makes you feel like you’ve known her forever. Not only did she ask what we envisioned for the day, but she helped us create a timeline, directed us on the city hall wedding process, and even compiled a whole email with other resources for hair/makeup and florists. My husband and I never take professional photos, so we don’t know how to pose elegantly, but Courtney’s direction, words, and vibe made the experience extremely fun and care-free. Our families loved her, and my relatives could not stop raving about her afterwards. I think one of the most important aspects of a photographer is to make their clients feel confident and comfortable, and to allow their emotions to organically shine - and Courtney does this perfectly.

From our first meeting we felt confident that we had found the right person to photograph our wedding. Julia is professional, organized and so very talented. She's also calm under pressure and a lot of fun. Julia was able to navigate the wedding (without being obtrusive) and took the most amazing shots -- all according to plan, and many more that were candid -- and those moments we will always cherish. She captured our joy and our friends and family on the most special day of our lives. I hope she is available for your wedding. You would be so lucky to have Julia as your wedding photographer!”Lynn and B., 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/julia-goldberg-photography)

Sarah Peterson Photography 5.0 San Francisco, CA

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $3,888 

I'm a Bay Area native with over 12 years in the commercial photography realm. I got my start on the beaches of Los Angeles back in 2012 shooting commercial swimwear campaigns for some of the best designers in swim and fashion. That opened the door to countless opportunities with modeling agencies, reality television, and fashion design. In 2018 I made the move back up north to San Francisco where I grew up. With a wide network of friends and family up here, I found myself catapulted into the Wedding and Elopement industry - and absolutely loved it! I'm honored when I get to be a part of one of the best days of a couple's life together.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Sarah was enjoyable and easy! As someone who usually does not like taking photos, Sarah made the process easy and comfortable. She got all the shots we had discussed in advance and captured every special moment. Her rustic editing style was exactly what I was looking for and really highlighted our flowers, centerpieces, and color scheme. Can't recommend Sarah enough!”Gianna & C., 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/sarah-peterson-photography)

Rachel Levine Photography 4.3 San Francisco, CA

  * Classic style
  * Starts at $1,800 

I'm best known for my elegant and playful small weddings photographed at the iconic San Francisco City Hall throughout the last decade. After serving many hundreds of couples there, I've taken my super powers as a creative storyteller and solver of all wedding planning problems out into the wonderlands of Northern California. Inspired by places that are stunningly beautiful yet still affordable I love finding creative twists to keep her couples excited about their weddings no matter what their budget.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I love this team so much already! They have been amazing to work with and have great communication skills from Rachel, Leza, Melika, Nora, and our officiant, Shawn. The whole process is so worth booking. As a busy couple, we needed an extra hand for our City Hall SF marriage. And they made our flowers just like we asked for! I am a social worker, and it is obvious that their team knows weddings and how to make sure the day flows smoothly. We had a snafu and the team helped us so much. I will post more of the review after my photos are sent as well. We had a fantastic day at City Hall on 10/31. Here is a cell phone photo I last min asked for :) Dog friendly is always a plus.”Sage B., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/7e3effb0-5380-490a-9244-30b03b0c18f2?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/rachel-levine-photography)

Vincent Po Photography 5.0 San Francisco, CA

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $3,100 

Oklahoma raised, Princeton educated, and founder of Portrait of a Young Couple, documenting how couples of all backgrounds and identities across the world live and love. I'd love to be a part of helping to capture you and your partner's love.“The Experience - My husband and I are both pretty camera shy, so it was really important for us to find someone we felt comfortable with. Vincent managed to win over my introverted husband in a surprisingly short period of time, and was easy to talk to about what we were looking for. Vincent was helpful in guiding us through poses for our couple portraits and also impressed us with how he made our friends and family comfortable throughout the day. The Photos - We wanted lovely photos that we could treasure, but we didn’t want all of the pictures to come out overly filtered or washed out. Vincent’s photography stood out to us because it feels authentic and timeless at the same time. He got the previews and photos back to us in a timely fashion after the wedding, and we were thrilled with how the pictures came out. There was one photo that we wanted something small photoshopped out of the background, and Vincent was accommodating in making that edit that we requested after receiving the photos. The Communication - With so much going on right before the wedding, it was helpful that Vincent checked in on us for things he needed a couple months ahead of time. This helped us know what to figure out and gave us buffer if we were late on getting back to him. He was always quick to respond to our questions, and as mentioned earlier, he was great at communicating after the event as well. Overall if you can get on Vincent’s calendar, I’d happily recommend our wedding photographer to anyone”Y L., 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/vincent-po-photography)

I’m JJ Ignotz, a wedding photographer based in The Bay Area. I specialize in capturing real, heartfelt moments and telling your unique love story. My approach blends timeless elegance with modern style, ensuring your photos remain beautiful for years to come. I take the time to understand your vision, so you feel relaxed and enjoy your day while I focus on the details that make your wedding truly special. Let’s create lasting memories and celebrate your love through authentic, stunning photography.“5-Star Review for JJ Ignotz Photography I can’t recommend JJ Ignotz Photography highly enough. JJ has been a trusted collaborator of mine for nearly a decade, photographing high-end weddings and events throughout New York City. Most recently, she captured our own wedding, and I can confidently say—there’s no one else I would have wanted behind the lens on such an important day. JJ is the full package: reliable, incredibly talented, deeply knowledgeable, and an absolute joy to work with. She brings a calm, professional presence to every shoot and has an uncanny ability to catch the real, unscripted moments that make events truly unforgettable. Her eye for detail, composition, and lighting is second to none, and she consistently delivers images that feel both timeless and alive. Whether you’re planning a luxury wedding, a corporate event, or an intimate celebration, JJ brings the same level of care, artistry, and enthusiasm. I’m grateful not only for the beautiful images she’s created over the years, but for the trust and partnership she brings to every project. Five stars, every time.”Ryan C., 10 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/326abc70-9fe2-4b76-b1f9-e140e384f627?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/jj-ignotz-photography-llc)
