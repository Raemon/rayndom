Born in San Francisco, I grew up in West Marin, traveled to the East coast and Ghana for schooling and I am currently based in the East Bay. A mother, gardener, hiker, traveler - I have a background in dance and psychology in addition to photography. I've photographed weddings for more than 20 years.

I am looking to capture authentic experience and expression. I hold reverence for the here and now and recognize the experience must be there before I can capture it. I am sensitive about my influence on the atmosphere. My aim is to document genuine emotion, limiting direction and staging to what can facilitate that end. I look for what is unique to the day, this couple, their community of friends and family, this moment...finding inspiration in authenticity and spontaneity.

  * ### Wonderful photographer

•Verified review

•Dorela + L.•Dec 22, 2020

Cindi is a wonderful and professional photographer. We had the pleasure of working with her for our April 2019 wedding in Napa, and the pictures came out beautiful! She goes above and beyond to make you feel comfortable in front of the camera.

  * ### Amazing wedding photos you'll cherish forever!

•Verified review

•Laura and T.•Dec 18, 2020

Cindi and her team at Two Irises turned our wedding memories into incredible photographs that we will enjoy for the rest of our lives! My favorite thing about working with Cindi is that she listened to what I wanted and took photos that I requested (family/wedding party shots, getting ready shots, etc.) but she also took so many candid photos and captured real moments of joy of my husband and I and our wedding guests. Those photos ended up being my favorite pictures! I loved her work so much I recommended Two Irises to our friends, who booked them for their wedding - and in exchange we were gifted a beautiful print of our choice from our wedding! Could not recommend Two Irises enough.
