  * ### Wedding at Fogo de Chão

•Verified review

•Priscila H.•Mar 24, 2023

We had our wedding last November and Fogo de Chão was very helpful in every step of the way. We booked 3 rooms which was perfect for our small wedding. The staff was very helpful as well as the event and general manager. Food was delicious as always. Our ceremony ended early and the manager was nice accommodating our guests a little bit earlier while we got our photos taken. It was such a good experience that now my husband wants to celebrate our anniversary every year at Fogo de Chão.

  * ### A great wedding experience at a restaurant!

•Verified review

•Isabela F.•Mar 23, 2023

We had our wedding reception at Fogo de Chão, San Jose in 2022, and it was an incredible event! We were looking for a venue that was all inclusive: food, drinks, tables, chairs, etc. This definitely simplified the process for us. The planning process was smooth and very flexible with their events team as well. There are great food and drink packages to choose from, they are very flexible with table arrangements, and they are very transparent about pricing. There were a couple of event management personnel changes throughout our planning process, but on their end, they made sure to honor our previous arrangements. They also worked very well with our month-of coordinator we hired. Overall, I would definitely recommend a restaurant buyout for a wedding at Fogo! The atmosphere was cozy, the food was incredible, and the restaurant is beautiful and chic requiring no extra decor on our end. Our guests raved about the food afterwards, and told us it was the best wedding they had been to!

My husband and I chose to have our wedding reception (170 guests) at Fogo de Chão in Santana Row, and we highly recommend it for anyone else considering a restaurant as a venue for a wedding reception. We were already familiar with both the Fogo de Chão San Francisco and Santana Row locations as we had dined at these two locations a few times prior to the wedding (both for date night and family outings). Each time the service was fantastic, so it was an easy choice for the both of us to make. I've assisted in planning wedding receptions for other family members and friends with various, typical, non-restaurant wedding reception venues, each and every time a different headache, so my husband and I knew for sure that choosing a restaurant would be the best choice. The Fogo de Chão team delivered and provided the easiest planning experience by far. Leo and Yelena provided us with timely updates, kept communication open, and kindly received and efficiently executed all of our requests. The night of our reception greatly exceeded our expectations. Fogo de Chão is a beautiful restaurant as is so very, very minimal decorations were needed. The quality of our dinner and service felt so luxurious. The staff was warm, highly attentive and catered to all of our guests' needs; we even had our own designated server for our sweetheart table. From the moment we inquired, all the way to the end of our wedding reception, Leo, Yelena, and the entire Fogo de Chão team made our experience extremely effortless, seamless, and memorable! Our guests to this day still rave about how delicious everything was, and the great time that they had! My husband and I are beyond happy and grateful that we were able to share our wedding day with the Fogo de Chão team. They made our wedding reception an event we will proudly look back on and cherish forever. A very heartfelt thank you to the Fogo de Chão team for this special time!
