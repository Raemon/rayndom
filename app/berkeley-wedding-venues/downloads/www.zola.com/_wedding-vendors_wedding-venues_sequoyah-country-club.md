•Verified review

•Julia C.•Nov 12, 2025

We are so happy we got married here! Sequoyah is a beautiful venue if are you looking for a romantic, rustic, classy style wedding. It has a beautiful view of the Bay Area so it’s perfect for sunset photos. The rooms are spacious and it was perfect for our wedding size (130 people). The staff is amazing here as well. The planning process was so smooth and stress free thanks to Andrea and Sally and their wonderful team!

  * ### Gay Jewish Wedding of Our Dreams

•Verified review

•Baylee C.•Nov 5, 2025

From the moment we inquired about hosting our wedding at Sequoyah Country Club, their team was caring, fast, and extremely effective in their communication. They were incredibly considerate of our needs as a queer couple and went above and beyond to ensure our special day was perfect. The venue itself was absolutely beautiful, with a wonderful rustic and spacious feel that felt so inviting to our guests. The amenities and food were flawless, and the staff was always extremely helpful in making sure every detail was taken care of. We are so grateful for the kindness and accommodations provided by the Sequoyah Country Club team, they truly helped make our wedding day an unforgettable celebration.

  * ### Sequoyah Country Club is a FANTASTIC venue! 

•Verified review

•Merril & D.•Oct 20, 2023

We can't say enough good things about Sequoyah Country Club. Andrea and Sally are the most attentive, responsive, professional, and kind venue coordinators out there. Our wedding was a beautiful success because of them and the SCC staff. They know how to host a wedding -- and it shows. We valued their expertise every step of the way. They've hosted so many weddings that they had great suggestions and solutions to every single thing that came up. Their recommended vendors list is valuable and we used it to hire our great day of coordinator. The venue is beautiful and well cared for inside and out. It shows in our pictures. All of the chairs, linens, glassware, cake stands, etc. were in great condition. The building and grounds are lovely so we didn't need excessive decorations or flowers. We don't live locally and planned the wedding from across the country -- it wasn't an issue with how well organized SCC is. It rained the night before our wedding and was unexpectedly a little colder than we anticipated -- Andrea and Sally helped us adjust our day of plans-- we kept the ceremony outside but moved cocktail hour inside with only a couple hour notice -- no one was stressed, they took care of it all. We had 150 people for an outdoor ceremony and indoor dinner and dancing. Lastly -- we were very happy with the pricing (so many things are included, and if they aren't already included, they're happy to arrange just about anything else!). We felt every single dollar was well spent. We can't recommend the venue enough -- the biggest thank you to Andrea, Sally, and the SCC staff.

  * ### My Dream Wedding

•Verified review

•Kristi & C.•May 18, 2023

We just had our wedding at Sequoyah this past weekend. Everything was perfect. The venue itself is stunning. It is such a beautiful setting for a wedding. We had our ceremony on the lawn and the reception inside. We spent the day getting ready on site and my entire bridal party kept commenting on how nice everything was. My dream was to get married amongst the redwoods and I cannot wait to see the photos from the day. The food was next level. When I say the food was delicious, I don't mean "for a wedding". We had many guests compliment the food. I have a friend who is an admitted "steak snob". She made sure I knew how good the filet was. Finally, the entire staff was wonderful to work with. We originally met with Andrea who showed us the venue. She was a big reason we chose Sequoyah. Andrea and Sally were helpful and flexible throughout the planning process. They were very responsive and made the process as easy as it could be. We hired a month-of coordinator who agreed they were wonderful. I would also like to mention Emma, who was so thoughtful and kind throughout the evening. After the wedding, I mentioned some of the nice things Emma did to my family and bridal party. Others had similar stories. She truly went above-and-beyond. I cannot recommend Sequoyah enough. They gave me the perfect wedding experience!
