  * ### Flawless Engagement Experience 

•Verified review

•Aliya Hall •Feb 15, 2024

My name is Aliya, and I'm the proprietor of LIYAS EVENTS. Recently, I was entrusted with the task of designing my client's engagement soirée at Fogo De Chao in Emeryville, CA. The entire affair was flawless from inception to conclusion. Fogo De Chao offers private spaces tailored to various celebratory events. The ambiance of the venue was impeccably suited for our client's engagement dinner. I had the privilege of collaborating with Scarlett Levin, the adept sales manager at Fogo De Chao. She ensures that your encounter with Fogo De Chao transcends mere booking to become an exquisite experience. The personnel were gracious, attentive, and always on hand to accommodate any needs. Fogo De Chao orchestrated a seamless and unforgettable event for my client's engagement, and I eagerly anticipate future collaborations with them.
