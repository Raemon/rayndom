  * ### Wedding venue of your dreams!

•Verified review

•Ruth Bonnell (.•Jan 22

Twenty Mile House was hands down THE BEST WEDDING DECISION WE MADE. Every time I think about that magical day I feel so lucky to have found this place. It’s exactly what I was looking for and more. So many of the typical issues that couples can have will be avoided simply by having TMH host your wedding. If you like the pictures/vibe on their website, then your search is over. This is the place you want. Book it. It’s worth every penny and more. Trust me, I already wasted all my time asking the millions of questions and came up satisfied. The venue itself is the stuff of Pinterest dreams. It is in the beautiful Lost Sierra’s on a 200-acre vintage estate. The ceremony site is nestled in a clearing in the woods, surrounded by towering pines. It feels intimate, personal, and perfect. The reception is set up on the red brick patio & garden lawns with a beautiful red brick house as the back drop. There are white twinkle lights wrapped around all the trees and draping like a canopy over the seating area and dance floor. The grounds and gardens are pristine. There’s a creek, a cute little bridge, a river, and railroad tracks. I mean, come on, what else could you ask for? It is understated elegance at its finest. Their AMAZING team of vendors each orchestrate their part flawlessly. That was one of the things that I didn’t even realize would be a huge benefit until afterwards. There were ZERO coordination issues. This staff does nearly 100 weddings a year together. Everyone knows their role and they have figured out how they intersect with each other. Best part is this all happens behind the scene and they pull it off like a beautiful dance. You feel like royalty. Everyone is there to support you and make your day (or days) perfect. From the moment we unloaded our stuff, they handled EVERYTHING. Even things I expected to have to do, I would find it already handled exactly as I would have handled it. You can expect to do all the planning, communicate the details, and then leave the coordination and execution to them! It’s glorious. The team at TMH exceeded our expectations in the ways they were able to not only pull off our vision EXACTLY, but also anticipate all our needs and desires. I was never made to feel like any request was too much, but rather that they were eager and excited to accommodate. You’ll leave here feeling like you stepped out of a fairy tale and you were a queen for a day. *sigh* If you want to have the wedding of your dreams and not lose your mind trying to pull it off, this is the place for you. Ruth (& Tim) PS: If you use the beautiful wooden photo backdrop, my husband and Father-in-law built that! Please sign the back like we did so when we go back to visit we can see all the other couples who got to enjoy it too :)

  * ### Best wedding ever!

•Verified review

•Sarah E.•Jan 20

Absolutely extraordinary! If you’re looking for a beautiful wedding venue, a professional staff, amazing food, outstanding customer service, and a stress free experience, then the Twenty Mile House is for you. Rachel was a first class wedding coordinator. Her professionalism and courtesy was impressive. Southern Accent provided the perfect home made food. Sonia the florist put together beautiful arrangements while Grandma Jans baked delicious desserts. Composing Reality captured our special day and provided us with beautiful photography. The DJ kept guests dancing all night. This all inclusive wedding venue is top notch! Rachel and all the Twenty Mile House staff helped make our dream wedding come to life!!!! Top wedding venue by far!

  * ### Our Dream Wedding Day at TMH

•Verified review

•Ben and R.•Jan 20

We got married here in July and have nothing but positive things to say about this place. TMH exceeded all of our expectations and we would highly recommend them to anyone considering getting married here! As our first impression of TMH, Rachel can take most of the credit for our decision. Her virtual tour with us was outstanding. She really took the time to give us a full “experience” of the property, answering all of our questions, so that we really got a good and complete picture, even without seeing the venue in person. She always made herself available and was responsive to our every need, as we made our decision. Her upfront and honest answers helped us to work within the timeline we had, make informed decisions, and ultimately make TMH a reality for us. Penie, the coordinator, far exceeded everything we could have hoped for, and then some. We attribute so much of our amazing experience at TMH to her and her efforts, from the very beginning all the way through the end. It was clear that creating our vision really mattered to her. She was very responsive and organized. We know she had many other couples but we always felt like we were the only one she was working with. We never had to worry about a thing as we knew she had our backs. She did an excellent job with EVERY little detail of our day! After being involved with quite a few weddings, it is easy to see how fortunate we were to have Penie. She is a stellar asset to TMH, and we will forever be grateful to her. The vendors that are included in the package worked very well together, and it was very apparent that they knew TMH well. It seemed like they were all TMH staff, and that made a huge difference in the way they worked and the ease of the day. All accommodations were clean, stocked, and ready to go when we arrived. If any of our guests needed anything, the staff at the General Store were happy to help. Sam and Susie stood out as TMH staff that helped us and our guests with anything that we needed throughout our stay. Our guests appreciated the character of the accommodations, as they were all very special, unique, and carried their own charm. Creekside was by far our favorite, and we enjoyed all of its special touches. We had multiple people tell us this was the best wedding they have ever been to, and we know that this reflected largely on TMH and its staff. We were able to relax and truly enjoy our day from beginning to end, and we know TMH played a huge part in that. Everything flowed well from one “stage” to the next. We were impressed with all the coordination that went on behind the scenes to allow this to happen. TMH staff did a really good job of making us, as well as our guests, feel extremely special and important. TMH staff worked well with all vendors to make the day completely seamless. The ceremony and reception site couldn’t have been more beautiful, and it was obvious that the small details matter to TMH. Our ceremony and reception were far from traditional, and they were pulled off without a hitch. We were able to take everything TMH offered and turn it into something unique and special to us. We appreciated TMH’s extraordinary flexibility in executing our vision. There was never any concern that we were going to get a “cookie cutter” experience out of an all-inclusive venue. Overall, TMH’s package offering took a huge burden off the planning process, which was a major selling point for us.

  * ### Incredible venue!

•Verified review

•Grace S.•Jan 20

Where to even begin?? We got married at Twenty Mile House in May 2023, and it was a dream every step of the way. The venue itself is incredible - its natural beauty, its quaint and romantic vibe, but also the great work that the staff does to keep it maintained, clean, and orderly. So many guests asked us how we found such a gorgeous venue! TMH’s all-inclusive nature made things so, so easy as well. We really enjoyed wedding planning, which we attribute entirely to their seamless setup. And every TMH vendor was amazing individually: Sonia (florist): Our florals were so beautiful, which is 100% on Sonia! We met with her over the phone and told her we didn’t know anything about flowers, so we didn’t have any direction to give her besides a high-level color scheme, and just trusted her to work her magic. And she did! Will (DJ): Our guests loved the dance floor playlist! We love to dance, so we planned things out to have as much dancing as possible. Will kept everyone moving for FOUR HOURS, and we all had a blast! Kim (desserts): The desserts were lovely, and Kim even whipped up a vegan cutting cake to accommodate my dietary restrictions. Her stuff is just as delicious as it is gorgeous! Holly (catering): Holly was such an amazing thought partner as we planned out our menu. We were not her easiest customers because one of us is vegan, the other is vegetarian, and we wanted to serve an all-vegetarian menu. Holly wasn’t intimidated in the slightest and helped us plan fully veggie menus for the rehearsal dinner, hors d’oeuvres, and reception dinner. The food was wonderful all around, and she was even able to accommodate additional (and unusual) dietary restrictions among our guests. She and her staff are excellent! Rachelle (photography): Rachelle is stellar and made us feel so comfortable all day long. Your photographer is with you for the most intimate moments, so you really want someone who has the right attitude/vibe/presence. That’s Rachelle all over! She is so warm and easy to get along with. And her photos are WONDERFUL! Staff: We had such positive experiences with every TMH staff member we worked with, from the grounds crew, to the housekeeping staff, to the bartenders. Absolutely everyone was friendly and helpful, going out of their way to make things convenient for us. They have a great team! Rachel (Director of Events): We talked to Rachel a lot when we were initially booking TMH and then later for the more business side of things. She is fantastic and really knows her stuff. We walked out of our first meeting with Rachel already positive that we’d be booking TMH. Penie (Wedding Coordinator): We CANNOT say enough wonderful things about Penie. Having Penie as our wedding coordinator was such a gift. She is incredibly organized and on top of things, and she kept us on track the entire planning process. When we showed up onsite the day before our wedding, we were able to completely hand the reins over to her, take a big sigh of relief, and focus on enjoying the weekend, because we were 100% confident that Penie was in control, knew our vision, and was going to execute. And she did!! We feel so lucky to have gotten to work with her! Overall, TMH was an incredible place to get married. We would recommend it to anyone who dreams of getting married in the forest, with soft light filtering through the trees, as a babbling stream flows nearby. Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone at TMH!
