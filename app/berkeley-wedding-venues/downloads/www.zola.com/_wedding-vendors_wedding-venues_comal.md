## About this venue

COMAL is a gathering place located in Berkeley’s bustling Arts District, just north of the Downtown Berkeley BART Station. The restaurant is housed in a single-story building (circa 1927) and features a lush, secluded rear patio with a full bar, covered dining area, and al fresco beer garden with fire pit. Executive Chef Matt Gandin creates earthy, modern interpretations of dishes from throughout Mexico, with emphasis on Oaxaca and neighboring coastal regions. We offer an “all-Mexican” list of craft cocktails, house-made sangritas paired with our curated collection of agave spirits, and a diverse selection of local beer and wine on tap.

  * ### A Modern & Dreamy Wedding Venue

•Verified review•Incentivized review

•Rebecca H.•Nov 10, 2025

Comal was perfect for our wedding! They made our event very low stress; they take care of so many logistics & the restaurant is so beautiful that it needs very little decoration. Our guests LOVED the food and cocktails. We really appreciated how the venue provided a modern feel while still having all the functionality of a more traditional wedding venue, with beautiful spaces for ceremony, dining, and dancing.
