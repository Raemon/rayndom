## About Coco-Creations

### Coco-Creations

Corporate, Wedding & Events Coordinator

Get a quote

I am a 'hands-on' Wedding and Events Coordinator that goes above and beyond my client's expectations. I take pride in what I do and ensure that everyone from my Bride and Groom or Host, their guests, and even their hired vendors are taken care of throughout the celebration.

There are two things that I enjoy when I'm working with my Clients, (1) the ability to be creative and add that 'special touch' when designing and setting up the venue and (2) seeing my Clients being 'in the moment' and not have to worry about anything and enjoying themselves celebrating with their family and friends.

  * ### The Wedding Planner You Need!

•Verified review

•Ria B.•Aug 23, 2024

Coco-Creations was an absolute lifesaver for our wedding. Elizabeth was incredibly detail-oriented, thorough, and patient as she guided us through the final stages of planning. She ensured we accounted for all the little details we hadn’t even considered. On the days of the wedding, we were able to fully immerse ourselves in the celebration without a single worry about behind-the-scenes logistics. Elizabeth’s meticulous attention to every aspect, from the big picture to the smallest detail, allowed us to truly enjoy every moment. We cannot recommend Elizabeth enough to any couple planning their wedding.

  * ### Elizabeth is fantastic - we coul

•Verified review

•Merril G.•Aug 7, 2023

We had a fantastic experience working with Elizabeth. She was the day-of-coordinator for our 150-person wedding in Oakland, CA in May 2023. The day before, and the day of our wedding went so smoothly thanks to her and her assistant Rachel. We were so grateful for her expertise and support – she did so much for us on the day of the wedding, and I’m certain she was doing things behind the scenes that we didn’t even know about that kept everyone and everything running perfectly, and on time. We confirmed our date with Elizabeth 9 months out, found and signed contracts with the rest of our vendors, and then started communicating with her again a few months out. She helped us with our timeline, got us thinking about quite a few things we hadn’t thought of, and then a few weeks before the wedding, we had a seamless handover. She helped our vision come to life, was very calming and kind, had great communication with the rest of our vendors, and we can’t recommend her enough.

  * ### Wonderful months of coordinator

•Verified review

•Constance L.•Oct 17, 2022

Elizabeth was the coordinator for our wedding and was an absolute pleasure to work with. Even from the very first call, she had such a calming presence that I knew she would be a vendor that I can reliably count on. We had a few calls with Elizabeth the months and weeks leading up to the wedding. During each call, Elizabeth would provide us with all the items we needed to check off before the big day. She also helped us fine-tune our timeline, and was great at communicating with all our vendors. Our big day definitely went very smoothly, with much thanks to Elizabeth! We'd highly recommend working with her for your wedding.

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### What should the customer know about your pricing (e.g., discounts, fees)?

My fee structure covers my services as a Corporate, Wedding & Special Events Coordinator, in which I am hired a few months before my Client's special day. It is a flat rate and will vary based on a few factors: 1) Number of Guests 2) Location of venue(s) if ceremony and reception are at one or two separate locations. 3) If the event date falls on or near a holiday 4) The town/city where the celebrations will take place at. If my clients are needing to hire me as a Full Service Corporate, Wedding & Special Events Planner, then my rate will increase.

### What types of customers have you worked with?

Most of my clients, specifically Bride's, are the DIY type Bride's. They have planned everything for their Wedding Day and are then needing a Coordinator, like myself, to come in and make sure everything is in order and to oversee the entire day's event. This is where I come in to assist my Bride and Groom and have them hand over the responsibility to me in making sure everything they planned on their wedding day is executed without any issues

### What advice would you give a customer looking to hire a provider in your area of work?

There are many Wedding Coordinators to select from. You would need to meet and talk to several Coordinators and find the one that you feel comfortable with. A Coordinator that understands your needs and wants on your wedding day and is easy to communicate with and stay on the same page through out the final planning stages of coordinating your Wedding Day.

### What advice would you give a customer when it comes Wedding Coordinator fees and rates?

In regards to fees and rates, there are Wedding Coordinators that offer a flat rate, such like myself, for the entire day and other Wedding Coordinators that offer a set rate/fee for 'x' amount of hours then charges an hourly rate if they go over the agreed number of hours they were hired for. Make sure you understand exactly what services will be provided for the price you are paying when hiring a Wedding Coordinator.
