![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We got married here in May of 2025, and I could not recommend this venue enough! This will likely be a long review, but if you are engaged and looking for a wedding venue, it is worth the read. Scribner Bend was the best option we could have chosen for our wedding, and I am so glad we did. Tldr: This venue works to save you money, has an attentive and detail oriented staff, and offers a lot to justify the price! The biggest standout was how committed the staff and team are to making sure you get the best value from your wedding. \- They cut fees without us asking (there was initially an outside vendor % fee that they changed to a flat price, or that %, whichever was lower) \- They worked with us to get what we wanted out of our wedding without additional costs (letting us substitute a red wine for sangria and a white wine for the sparkling almond without an upcharge, letting us know how to get a vegetarian option for our guests without having to pay for an additional main course, allowing us to bring in things that the venue doesn't provide at no extra cost, etc.) \- they allowed us to make changes to our headcount before making the final payment. The wedding industry is FULL of people who know they can throw in extra fees without repercussion, and Scribner bend is not like that at all. \- They honored the venue and catering price we signed under, even though we got married almost 2 years after signing. They did this without us asking. \- The venue also processed and sent the refund of our deposit by the time we got back from our honeymoon. Additionally, the staff and service overall was amazing. They remembered us by face every time we went into the tasting room, they were reachable with questions and had a wonderful response time(and I had a LOT of questions since I did not have a planner), and it was clear that they wanted to make the wedding process easy for us. Our wedding coordinator was extremely knowledgeable on everything (from venue details to the best time to call an uber back home), and she coordinated so well with Rain from Paesanos. She actually ran our wedding rehearsal better than full service planners i've seen at other weddings. The team offered well-planned options for day-of logistics, but were 100% on board with our updated vision for the day, and made it come to life at no extra cost. Scribner bend is also an easy venue to get married at. The grounds are naturally beautiful, so the only florals we bought were my bouquet to hold, and flowers for our tables. This saved us THOUSANDS of dollars. The venue is private (and the tasting rooms are closed by the time of the wedding) so you never run the risk of wedding crashers. The getting ready bungalow was HUGE. We were able to do florals and candles, have two make up artists, AND have private places to relax and get dressed without being overcrowded (and I had a huge wedding party). My husband loved the air stream as well, but I still still think the bungalow was better :). They had a good relationship with Celebrations party rentals, where my husband and I were able to customize our rentals, but still get them through Scribner Bend at a slightly lower cost (fewer fees!). I thought we were going to feel like the 11pm stop time was too early, but it actually made sure the party went until the very end, and allowed us time to say goodbye to our loved ones without feeling like we were missing any part of the evening. I would recommend Scribner bend 100 times over!”Alyssa K., 2 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/15783aa9-5ba3-4ce3-bfc8-cc75b80e159c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/scribner-bend-vineyards)

From the moment we arrived, we were blown away by how stunning the space is—pictures truly don’t do it justice. Every corner feels like it’s been pulled from a fairytale. What made it even more special was meeting Sabrina, the new manager. She is warm, passionate, and incredibly detail-oriented. You can instantly feel how much she cares—not just about the venue, but about your vision and experience. She walked us through everything with so much enthusiasm and clarity that we left feeling completely confident and inspired. The new owners, Sabrina and Chase are not just maintaining the beauty of the venue—they're investing in thoughtful, meaningful upgrades that make the space even more magical. From landscaping to layout improvements, it’s clear they want every inch of the venue to feel perfect for their couples. We feel so lucky to have found this place and to be working with such a dedicated, and talented team. If you're considering this venue—don’t hesitate.

“Can’t put into words how great our experience with The Chalet Event Center went throughout our entire wedding planning process! They went above and beyond to walk us through what our big day would look like on the property- from ceremony to reception, they executed our vision and made our dream wedding a night to remember. Bosue, you are an amazing host and thank you for helping us have our dream wedding. Not only did you fulfill all of our wishes, you really came through for us when there was going to be a 59% chance of rain. Most brides have so much on their mind, but you reassured me that there would be a back up plan incase of bad weather (something I failed to think of). It’s the little things like this, that I take away from working with a business. They remember the things we may forget! It’s all in the details! The food was amazing on our wedding night, the kitchen killed it! The bar staff were so friendly, welcoming and helped keep our guests happy! The on site staff, Bosue and Roberto ensured our day went smoothly (timing, everything was set up correctly, and guests were attended to when they needed something). I could go on and on, but my favorite thing was that Bosue had the best communication. Throughout all of my planning, he really accommodated all of my requests and was always available from May 2024 (planning stages) to our big day 10/25/2025. The Chalet is a beautiful place to host an event, whether an outdoor ceremony or inside reception- they truly went above and beyond to make our day special. And with that being said, I highly recommend this event space and the staff here. They are a one of a kind team thank you Chalet Team from the bottom of our hearts, you know we will be back for another event! With love, The Parkers”Megan M., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/a95d69d8-d4f0-4143-9a60-18553e496f99?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-chalet-event-center)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Union Brick By Wedgewood Weddings was an excellent choice for our wedding venue. The communication with the staff, especially Keilah, Savanna, and Nathalie, was superb - they were always willing to help and very approachable. The venue itself had an elegant, spacious, and calm aura that was great value for the cost. The food prepared by Jeremy and his crew was excellent, and the open bar was overflowing, providing great service throughout the night. The DJs kept the dance floor lively, and the photobooth was a fun addition. The security was also courteous, ensuring our special day went off without a hitch.

“The Flower Farm Inn was the perfect venue for our wedding. From the beginning, the staff was incredibly helpful, responsive, and provided detailed information to ensure our day went smoothly. The venue itself was clean, beautiful, and elegantly designed, providing the ideal location for our celebration. The staff assisted us in setting up the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception spaces, and their recommendations were spot on.

## About wedding venues in Folsom, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
