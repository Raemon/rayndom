## About Dejane Jane De Art

### Dejane Jane De Art

Hi, I'm Jane from DejaneJanedeArt, a watercolor artist based in NY and Bay Area Northern California, but available for destination weddings internationally. Want to give a wedding gift that’s as unique and personal as the couple’s love story? Live wedding painting is an interactive and memorable experience. This allows your guests to watch as I create a beautiful artwork in real-time, capturing the magic of your celebration right before their eyes. As a result, the couple will receive a fully framed, ready-to-hang original artwork that will transport them back to this special day whenever they look at it.

Watercolor is a delicate and refined medium, one of the most challenging to master. It captures light and movement with unparalleled grace, and its transparency and soft textures lend a lighter, more graceful feel than oil or acrylic paints. Each portrait is meticulously hand-painted, ensuring that the essence and emotion of the couple’s special day are beautifully conveyed. From the first kiss and the walk down the aisle to the joy of the first dance, these portraits are carefully crafted, creating a personal and meaningful keepsake that brings these moments to life. The camera can capture what is seen; the brush captures what is felt.

**In three words:** Confident, Honest, Organized

Jane De was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding! The quality of her work was absolutely gorgeous, stunning, and vibrant. She added an element to our wedding that our guests had never seen before and it was a huge hit, creating a one-of-a-kind memento from our special day. I would highly recommend Jane De Art to any couple looking to make their celebration truly unique and memorable. Our guests are still talking about the live painting!

  * ### INCREDIBLE artist & live painting experience!

•Verified review

•Christine M.•Nov 3, 2025

We hired Jane as a live painter for our wedding in Virginia, and Jane is an absolute pleasure to work with and incredibly talented! We are elated with the experience and final framed watercolor portrait from Jane. I was interested in surprising my wife with a live painter but it was initially challenging finding someone whose artwork we both would love and also be in our budget. After discovering Jane’s beautiful portfolio and meeting with her via video call, I knew Jane was worth booking! As a queer couple, I appreciated how her pricing/package descriptions used gender-inclusive language (like “newlyweds” instead of traditional “bride” and “groom”). As an interracial couple, we generally have concerns that our skin tones may not look right in edited photos or paintings, but Jane did a fantastic job and was very accurate in our portrait. Jane also offers to include up to two pets with the newlyweds in her base live painting package, so I was delighted to have our dog be “a part” of our wedding day through Jane’s painting. Many of our guests admired and complimented Jane’s painting progress throughout the night, and it was truly a treat to watch it come to life. In addition to her use of color, we really loved her use of the paper/white space as highlights in the portrait. She captured our happiness and love in our faces beautifully, and we HIGHLY recommend her if you’re looking for a memorable and talented live painter for your special day!

  * ### Best decision ever!! Beautiful & timeless keepsake

•Verified review

•Kelly•Jul 12, 2025

Having Jane as our live wedding painter was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding day!! Throughout the day, it was amazing to watch the painting evolve and see the scene slowly take shape. The final piece is beyond anything we could have imagined! Jane captured the emotion, the setting, and the moment so perfectly and beautifully. We get to relive our favorite memory every time we look at it. You can really tell that Jane puts her heart into the painting. Every detail was thoughtfully included, and the result is a stunning piece of art that we will cherish forever. Not only was the painting stunning, Jane was so quick to get us the finalized piece. The wedding was Saturday, she took the painting home for the final touches/framing, and the finalized piece was delivered on Wednesday!! If you are considering a live painter for your wedding, I cannot recommend Jane highly enough. Her talent, professionalism, and genuine passion for painting made the experience unforgettable. We are so grateful to have such a timeless keepsake from our special day!

  * ### The live painting experience was one-of-a-kind

•Verified review

•Rachel•Apr 28, 2025

We booked Jane shortly before our wedding, and I couldn’t be happier that we did. I’d been interested in incorporating live painting into our wedding for a while but struggled to find someone available and within our budget. On my MIL's recommendation, I decided to take another look—and I’m so glad I found Jane. Having her live paint at our wedding was an incredible experience. Our guests were captivated as they watched her create during the ceremony and throughout the evening. As it turned out, we had a lot in common personally and creatively—she’s also planning her own wedding—which made working together feel serendipitous. From our first conversation to meeting her in person on our wedding day, everything just clicked. Jane completed the painting so quickly! Due to our honeymoon, we didn’t get to see it in person until about a month after the wedding, but it was well worth the wait. The painting is stunning and now hangs across from our bed, where it serves as a daily reminder of our special day. Jane is incredibly creative and collaborative. Also, she traveled from NY to Northern Virginia for the day! She even offered great advice on sizing and framing, helping us choose the perfect option for our space. The live painting experience was truly one-of-a-kind, but I’d absolutely work with her again on other projects, like her beautiful pet or architectural paintings.
