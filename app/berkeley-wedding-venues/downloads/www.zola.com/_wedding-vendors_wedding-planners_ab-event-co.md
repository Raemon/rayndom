  * ### Perfect Day 

•Verified review

•Mareesa S.•Jun 6, 2025

There are not enough words to describe what an incredible job Ali and her team did for our wedding. From her original design that perfectly captured our style and personality to the final product, she made the day perfect. We had a pretty complicated venue and it was a very warm day and at no point did I have to worry that something wasn't being taken care of. It was such an amazing year working together and I will miss our monthly meetings but can't wait to watch all of her success from afar. I am so happy we hired Ali and would do it again in a heartbeat!

  * ### Ali is the absolute best!

•Verified review

•Analisa S.•Dec 27, 2024

Ali is literally the best wedding coordinator a couple could ask to have. From the moment we first spoke with her, she made us feel comfortable and confident that we would have a smooth wedding planning experience and stress free wedding day. Although the stress is inevitable, Ali lifted a ton of weight off of our shoulders the entire last month leading up to our wedding and the wedding day was more beautiful than we could’ve imagined. Our only regret was not choosing full service planning with Ali and only going with month-of! We can't imagine the process going smoothly without Ali and her team and highly recommend her to all of our friends and family. She helped us more than we could have ever hoped – from always being available to give us advice on any decisions we had to make, big or small, to making sure we truly were able to enjoy and not worry about anything but being present on our wedding day. There are so many behind-the-scene logistical challenges that we did not even notice until we thought about it after the wedding and realized were handled by her team. We were able to trust her 100% in any stylistic choices because we know she has a good eye for aesthetics and making our vision come to life. She took the time and effort to learn what we as a couple uniquely like, and made sure that everything was perfect on the wedding day. Ali’s experience and advice are what makes her planning invaluable, even the smallest things you might not think about can make such a big difference on how the day pans out. We genuinely don’t think our wedding would have been possible without her and her expert team!

  * ### Ali was our wedding-planning superhero!!!

•Verified review

•Paige R.•Nov 25, 2024

I can honestly say that Ali was our wedding-planning superhero! When we first started planning our wedding, I wasn’t even considering hiring a wedding planner since our venue came with a coordinator. However, looking back now, I truly have no idea how we would have pulled off our wedding without Ali. She was absolutely indispensable! I did most of the vendor research and design planning on my own, and while that was manageable, Ali’s services took the entire experience to the next level. She was a lifesaver when it came to the logistics. She kept me organized, helped me stay on track, and made sure I was realistic about what could be done within my vision and budget. Even when the process got overwhelming, Ali was there, ensuring I didn’t get lost in the details or stray too far from my goals. On the wedding day itself, Ali truly shined. From what I was told, there were a few hiccups throughout the day (which is inevitable with any event of this scale), but I never had to worry about a thing. Ali quietly and efficiently handled everything behind the scenes, ensuring that I wasn’t aware of any issues and always had a solution in place before I even knew there was a problem. Thanks to her, I was able to relax and enjoy every moment of our special day without stress. If you’re on the fence about hiring a wedding planner, I can wholeheartedly recommend Ali. She made all the difference for us, and I’ll forever be grateful for her dedication, expertise, and calm presence. She is an absolute gem!

  * ### AMAZING!

•Verified review

•Kelli G.•Sep 15, 2024

Ali was our wedding coordinator for our August 2024 wedding, and we cannot recommend her enough! She truly made sure our wedding day went smoothly. Her attention to detail is extraordinary — I forgot the easel for our Welcome sign and Ali noticed during our wedding rehearsal and brought hers on the day of the wedding! I didn’t even know she did this until after our honeymoon. Ali truly helps with organization throughout the months leading up to the wedding, helped us make sure every detail was squared away, and put out any wedding day fires without us even knowing. Before the wedding, she met with us many times over Zoom and her process is very well designed - she helped us with details we didn’t even think of and answered all of our questions so well. On the day of the rehearsal, she was organized and managed the entire rehearsal with our large wedding party, even though many of us were running late. On the day of the wedding, she set up our tables beautifully and she definitely has an eye for making your table decor look perfect! The timeline that she organized for the vendors and us helped keep the day on track. I know she and her assistant probably did many things on the day that we will never know, but we are so grateful for all of her help. We will be recommending Ali to all of our recently engaged friends. Our wedding day was only as perfect as it was because of Ali!

## Frequently asked questions

3 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you take on multiple weddings in a day or weekend?

I typically do only one wedding per weekend, but can do up to 2 if they are on a Friday & Sunday/.

### Describe your experience. How many weddings have you planned, and what are they like? Any specialties?

I have been involved in the wedding industry for over 6 years and have coordinated 200+ weddings. Prior to launching my own full-service planning business, I worked as an Event Coordinator for two local venues where I was able to oversee a diverse range of events & clientele. My passion lies in getting to know my clients on a deeper level and helping them hone in on what they really want for their wedding day. Because of this, I knew that starting AB Event Company was the right direction! I love the fact that I have the time & opportunity to work so closely with my clients throughout their planning process!

### How much time should we expect to spend with you?

Most of my Partial & Full Planning clients book me 12+ months prior to their wedding day, while many Month-of Coordination clients book closer to their wedding day. All of my packages include several meetings during the planning process prior to our takeover period, but the specific number of meetings is dependent on the package you choose. On the wedding day, all clients can expect 10 onsite hours for me and an Assistant Coordinator!
