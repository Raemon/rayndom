Bay Area PhotoBooth was an absolute delight to work with for our wedding! From the moment we booked them, their communication was attentive, kind, and punctual. The quality of their work and overall value was truly awesome - they were incredibly respectful and responsive throughout the entire process. On the day of our wedding, they made it completely hands-off for my wife and I, which was so appreciated as we were focused on enjoying our special day.

Festa is an AI event coordinator that transforms how modern events are run — starting with weddings. Instead of juggling group chats, spreadsheets, and endless back-and-forth, Festa manages RSVPs, guest questions, and real-time updates directly through text.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I’ll be honest: when my fiancé suggested using an AI texting assistant for our wedding, I rolled my eyes. I pictured something clunky or robotic. But Festa turned out to be a genuinely helpful tool. Guests could text questions and get instant, accurate answers — no one had to call us or bug our planner about shuttle times or dress code. When we ran into a small issue setting it up, the founders responded quickly and kindly (yes, real humans!). They’re clearly trying to build something thoughtful, not just flashy tech for tech’s sake. Would use it again in a heartbeat.”Diane, 7 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/festa-ai--2)

*Dearest is not a photo booth. Dearest is a beautifully simple way to gather and preserve memories from weddings, showers, birthdays, retirements, and more. Guests share photos, videos, and heartfelt messages via a personalized QR code—after the event, so they can be fully present. Every package includes a private gallery to view, download, print, or turn into a curated photobook. We also offer printable QR code templates, signage, and display cards on Etsy, with 100% of profits benefiting Vow for Girls, a global movement to end child marriage. More than a guest book, Dearest keeps the joy, love, and laughter alive long after the celebration.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Me and my besties had a girls trip and we took SO MANY memorable photos. Instead of sending, sharing, remembering, etc., it was so easy for each of us to just post the photos to Dearest. Voila! Everything is compiled, organized and shared.

BNG Worldwide Chauffeur Services is a premier transportation company based in San Jose, CA, proudly serving the San Francisco Bay Area since 2014. Specializing in weddings and special events, BNG offers a luxury fleet of SUVs, sedans, and 27–56 passenger buses to suit every celebration. Whether it’s a one-way transfer or a full-day itinerary, BNG ensures every ride is on time, seamless, and elegant — delivering a VIP experience for you and your guests.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We booked BNG Worldwide Chauffeur Services for our wedding in San Jose, and they truly exceeded our expectations. From the first inquiry to the final drop-off, their communication was clear, professional, and responsive. We had an Executive Sprinter Van for the bridal party and a black SUV for family members. Both vehicles arrived early, spotless inside and out, and the chauffeurs were dressed professionally and extremely courteous. Our driver for the Sprinter (I believe his name was Sam) was especially great—he helped the bridal party in and out, managed time perfectly, and even had water bottles ready in the van. What stood out most was how stress-free they made the whole experience. They coordinated directly with our wedding planner for timing and route changes, which took a huge load off our shoulders. If you’re planning a wedding in the Bay Area—especially around San Jose, San Francisco, or Oakland—I’d strongly recommend BNG. They know how to handle weddings and treat everyone like a VIP.”Scarlet W., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/bng-worldwide-chauffeur-services)

From DIY booking to full-service delivery, we handle every detail so you look effortlessly thoughtful.“Lavish, An Experience Company was an absolute joy to work with for my clients wedding. Their communication was consistently positive, organized, and thoughtful, which put us at ease throughout the planning process. The quality of their work was truly lavish - they were thorough, detailed, and ensured every aspect of their special day was executed flawlessly.

Rueé—luxury, as you desire. We’re a women-founded designer handbag rental service for wedding week. Borrow authentic iconic designer bags for your shower, rehearsal, ceremony, and honeymoon—then return with ease. Two simple tiers ($88 / $168), professionally cleaned and insured. The right bag helps you carry your story and makes precious moments even more memorable. Sustainable, flexible, beautifully practical—own the look, not the bag.“I can’t say enough good things about Rueé! From start to finish, the experience has been seamless and truly elevated. I’ve always admired luxury handbags but hesitated to invest in just one or two pieces because styles change and occasions vary. Rueé has completely solved that problem—I now get to enjoy a rotating collection of gorgeous designer bags without the guilt or financial burden of buying them outright. The website is easy to navigate, and the pictures and descriptions are very true to what you receive. My bag arrived right on time, beautifully packaged, and in pristine condition. You can tell they take incredible care of their pieces—everything feels fresh, polished, and special, just like if I had bought it directly from the boutique. What I appreciate most is the flexibility. Some weeks I want a classic piece for everyday use, and other times I’m attending a wedding, event, or vacation and want something bold and eye-catching. Rueé makes it so easy to pick the perfect bag for the occasion. The compliments I’ve received have been endless, and no one can tell it’s a rental—it feels completely mine while I’m using it. The return process is just as easy as the delivery—simple, quick, and stress-free. Customer service has also been wonderful; they’re responsive, thoughtful, and genuinely want you to have the best experience. Overall, Rueé has made luxury fashion more fun, attainable, and sustainable for me. Instead of letting a few expensive purchases collect dust in my closet, I now get to enjoy variety, freedom, and confidence with every bag I carry. I’m already looking forward to my next rental—it feels like a little luxury surprise waiting for me each month!”Lena, 4 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/ruee)

She had no idea this kind of thing even existed — and when it arrived, she actually cried. Her bridal bouquet was turned into a gorgeous resin piece that now sits in her living room. It’s elegant, timeless, and such a special reminder of her day. The team at Everlasting Bloom Co. made everything easy.

  * Pet coordination
  * Starts at $550 
  * Serves Turlock, CA

Labra-Adore You Furever is a proud women-owned, family-run small business offering wedding pet attendant services in Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama and the West Coast. We also offer dog boarding and housesitting services in the Nashville, TN area.“We cannot say enough wonderful things about Labra-Adore You Furever. Having our dogs, Charlie and Louie, as part of our wedding day was incredibly important to us, but we were also worried about how to manage them throughout the chaos of the day. From the moment Ashlee arrived, we felt completely at ease — she instantly understood our dogs’ personalities and needs and treated them with the same patience and affection we do. Charlie is rambunctious and curious, and Louie has special needs, so we know they’re not the easiest pair. But Ashlee went above and beyond for both of them. She comforted Charlie when he got overstimulated and even carried Louie when the floors were too slick for him to walk confidently. The level of attentiveness, care, and genuine love she showed was beyond anything we could have hoped for. What meant the world to us was the peace of mind she gave us. We didn’t have to worry for a single moment — we got to be fully present in our wedding day while knowing our boys were safe, happy, and cared for. And as an extra surprise, she even took photos of Charlie and Louie throughout their time together, which brought us so much joy when we saw them later. Those little candid memories are priceless. If you are considering including your pets in your wedding or any special event, please consider Labra-Adore You Furever. Their service was not just professional — it was heartfelt. We are forever grateful for the care, compassion, and peace of mind Ashlee provided. Truly the best gift we could have asked for.”Dan, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/ada063a0-8105-47e6-a03f-24e7469d22e8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/labra-adore-you-furever)
