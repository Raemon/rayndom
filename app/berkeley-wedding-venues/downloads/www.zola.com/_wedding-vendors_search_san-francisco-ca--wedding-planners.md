She helped us with the vendors we needed, met with us multiple times to talk over logistics, and handled the Day Of completely and the day ran without a hitch! I’m a super anxious person and an overthinker but Evelyn made sure to always calm my nerves and I would always leave our meetings feeling relieved and at peace. She is such a light of a person too; she’s warm and bubbly and funny all while being professional and that connection was something really I needed. I didn’t just want a robot running the day, I needed to feel that connection and with Evelyn that was instant. Our wedding day turned out exactly what we had for so long dreamed of and we couldn’t thank Evelyn enough for taking care of us throughout these months. We love her and you will love her too!!”Brooklyn, 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/love-laughter-weddings)

We gave her quite the challenge by asking her to plan our wedding entirely virtually. My husband and I live in MS and she coordinated our MI wedding from CA. She made our wedding process super easy and smooth even though we only gave her less than 7 months to plan a full wedding! She gave us checklists every time we met virtually to figure out what we needed to focus on each month leading up to the wedding so we never felt overwhelmed. Come the day off, everything ran smoothly and perfectly as it should have. No matter what you have going on, big or small, no matter where, Sid is your girl. I had never even met her in person until the night before my wedding but felt like she understood exactly what I wanted. We can’t say enough good things about her!”Cynthia P., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/3a2e7f23-cf5e-45f9-99b4-1682da57e2c1?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/squid-inc-social-events-design)

She was such a delight to work with, so kind and easy going while still being on top of everything. We weren’t sure what to expect in the planning process and instantly felt at ease with her. She was ahead of everything on our to-do list and thought of a million things we didn’t consider. On our wedding day, we didn’t lift a finger and Val ran everything so smoothly. They say something always goes wrong at a wedding, but in our case everything went even better than we’d hoped. If you’re looking for a planner/coordinator, Val is absolutely it!”Kaitie H., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/8353257b-3126-4c8d-84ed-9083b09b3a4c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/gthr)

Events by Margarita 5.0 San Francisco, CA

  * Offers 3 services
  * Starts at $2,000 

Hello nearlyweds! I'm Margarita, yes just like the tasty tropical drink. :) I love weddings and I always have. I have cried at all the ones I have attended, and my friends tease me because I will ask anyone who has me over to show me their wedding album! I have spent the past few years working for Wedgewood Weddings and learning everything there is to know about weddings and events. I have helped plan over 200 weddings and personally coordinated more than 120 weddings with guest counts ranging from 20-250+. Prior to that I worked in tech account management, which gave me the experience to provide you with top tier customer service.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We used a Website called Mostest to find a budget friendly day of coordinator. We were initially skeptical of Mostest and how it worked, because we only meet the planner one month before the day of the event. This was only because we used a day of coordinator, rather than a full on event planner. Our wedding was 120 people at Cavallo Point Lodge. Ceremony was outside, cocktail hour was under a nice heated tent, and the dinner & Dancing was inside in a banquet hall. One Month before the wedding, We have our first call with Margarita. She was exceptional in every way. She had a template of the items that she knew we needed to think through. She then seamlessly and meticulously took the agenda from the photographer, venue, florist, caterer, DJ, and any other vendors that I'm for getting and put them into a PERFECT PDF that they each used for the coordination of the day. In total, we met with Margarita a total of three or four times before the wedding. Despite our initial skepticism with Mostest, by the day of our wedding we had absolutely question in our mind about how smoothly the day would go - and this was BECAUSE of margarita. After each meeting, she would give us a "To do" list of things we needed to decide on. At each subsequent meeting, she would circle back and cross every single T and dot every single I. We had a pretty "Involved" Wedding - a Long walk in to the ceremony from the bridal suite, father of the bride doing the ceremony, two readings by family members, A song played & sung by the sister of the bride (with an acoustic electric guitar which required an amp and a microphone setup for singing), a tree planting ceremony, personally written vows, and coordinated music throughout. Margarita had each of these things timed down to the minute (second?). If we allocated too much or too little time for one thing, she would tell us and we'd adjust accordingly. She was early to our wedding rehearsal, ready to roll in the cold Sausalito wind, and was there early on the day of our wedding to make sure that things went smoothly. By the end of the wedding, our mantra was "Just ask Margarita and do whatever she says". Because sincerely as two people who have never been married and frankly had no clue what is involved in orchestrating a wedding - Margarita absolutely cannot be beat. Even after the wedding, she somehow perfectly boxed up all of our stuff so that we could come and grab it the next day. Thank you Margarita for making this day so incredibly special for Taylor and I. We're now looking to host more events JUST so we can work with Margarita again.”John and T., a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/7768f81b-1e34-40ca-92af-8531a06a75b1?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/events-by-margarita)

Nomad Nixon 5.0 San Francisco, CA

I have always been the go-to friend when you need help hosting a party, always the bridesmaid with a clipboard. After leaving my job as an executive assistant, I decided to turn my passion for organizing events into a reality and created Nomad Nixon. I'm an Enneagram 2 with an even 1-3 wing, loosely translated to "I'm a perfectionist that feels most successful by helping others." Quality time is my love language. I love getting to know each couple and embracing their unique love story.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Kendra absolutely rocked our wedding. Her ability to stay calm during all the ups & downs and changed minds about wedding planning was key to helping us stay on track throughout our two year wedding planning journey. She was there for us at the start and was able to guide us back to our initial goals of having a kickass San Francisco wedding. She organized our park ceremony seamlessly and had an assistant setting up at the restaurant where we had our reception while we bopped around the city on a double decker trolley (shout out Nationwide Limo), showing our guests the best of the city.

We first started working together before the pandemic, and from the beginning she was an amazing advisor that helped me deal with the difficult decisions a bride-to-be has to make. I was very impressed by her proactiveness, professionalism, and wealth of knowledge about how to make the day special. She checked in with us regularly over the 2 year delay and helped us manage the challenging process of rescheduling multiple times. As we got closer to our wedding day, Jackie made sure we had every detailed lined up, including things my husband and I didn't even consider. She helped take care of signage, shipping, confirming with vendors, table/space set-up, and more. On the day of our wedding, she directed vendors, guided guests, and dealt with unforeseen emergencies. Our wedding could not have gone smoother and it was in a large part because of Jackie!

She was super responsive and met with us over Zoom multiple times (and once in person) to make sure every detail was covered. She had the answer to all of our questions and helped build the most detailed wedding timeline — down to the minute — so everything stayed perfectly on track. Our rehearsal went seamlessly with her guidance on how to walk and even how parents should hold arms. On the wedding day, everything flowed beautifully. I was nervous to walk down the aisle, but Cierra reassured me and helped calm my anxiety. The reception looked stunning, she helped bustle my dress with ease, and at the end of the night, she packed everything up neatly for us to pick up later.

I’ve always been inspired by the strong, ambitious women in my life who built successful small businesses in the hospitality industry — from restaurant owners and bakers to caterers and florists. Growing up surrounded by their entrepreneurial spirit, I was motivated to follow my own path and create something meaningful in the world of events. ​ After spending two years working as a Wedding Coordinator at the Westin, the pandemic hit and forced a pause on hotel weddings. That unexpected turn of events only fueled my determination to turn my passion into a full-time business. And so, Kaci Danae Events was born.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Kaci was a great experience.

We never felt behind schedule or rushed because Yoko and team were so organized and on top of it. They really took care of us throughout the entire process. Something we appreciate is that they anticipated we'd need breaks during the day and scheduled those for us as well, they also made sure we were fed and hydrated throughout!

They didn’t just meet our expectations; they exceeded them with thoughtful touches and moments of surprise and delight throughout the year-long process. One of the standout aspects was their vendor recommendations. They guided us toward partners who perfectly matched the theme and energy we envisioned for our day, elevating the entire experience. When a major hurdle arose with the delivery timing of some rentals, Dana went above and beyond, advocating fiercely to ensure everything worked out perfectly. Her determination and professionalism made all the difference in what could have been a stressful situation.

I highly recommend Sandra and her team. When we were looking for help with wedding planning, we wanted a planner who could make our backyard wedding everything we imagined. Since we didn’t have a real “venue,” we had to bring in everything. This overwhelming task felt completely achievable with Sandra's help. Sandra is extremely hardworking and dedicated to making your day the most special and perfect event. Despite only having her partial services, Sandra met with us over ten times and drove to our venue site countless times to reassure us that everything would work out as we imagined. She even brought in extra team members for the complicated task of flipping our ceremony venue into a dinner reception. She attended our tastings with us and advocated on our behalf’s when we had decision fatigue with numerous vendors. Believe me when I say, we would never have been able to plan this event without Sandra’s help. Her expertise in helping us hand-pick every vendor, nail down a super complicated timeline, and ensure we didn’t get overwhelmed in the process was crucial to our Wedding. I have never worked with someone as great as her before! I couldn’t recommend her enough and am so thrilled with how my wedding turned out. We will miss working with Sandra so much!

I've loved weddings since childhood, from sketching dresses in my notebooks to planning my own wedding in 2019. That experience confirmed my passion for coordination, logistics, and making wedding days seamless. After serving as Maid of Honor multiple times, I became the go-to planner for friends.

From the start, she helped us fine-tune our wedding timeline and order of events, ensuring every detail was accounted for. On the day of, everything ran flawlessly our 120-person celebration felt effortless, allowing us to truly soak in every moment without stress. A special bonus? Her husband, an ordained officiant, performed our ceremony beautifully, adding such a personal and heartfelt touch to our day. If you’re a DIY bride, Kalyna is an absolute must-have.

From the moment we started working with Natalie at our first initial call, we felt an instant sigh of relief that we were able to work with someone who understood our vision. Natalie was able to build mood boards and decks of beautiful inspiration photos after describing to her how we wanted our wedding to look and feel. She worked with us as a partial wedding planner, although we truly wished we found her from the start to book her as a full wedding planner! With every decision that needed to be made along the process (whether it was deciding to spend more on an item or cut back on other items) she always made sure to lay out ALL the options, which helped us make an informed decision. Natalie even took a day out of her time to go shopping with me for welcome table decor the week of my wedding to ensure that we had something ready and set up for the big day!
