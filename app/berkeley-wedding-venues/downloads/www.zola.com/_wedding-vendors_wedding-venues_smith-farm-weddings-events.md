  * ### Just what we wanted!

•Verified review

•B & C.•Oct 25, 2023

Smith Farm was perfect for our wedding! We had a little over 200 guests. SF was affordable, beautiful and had everything we needed! Donna was extremely helpful and went above & beyond what I asked. They thought of everything which made things so much easier on us. Highly recommend for budget conscious couples with a large guest list and those looking for an amazing indoor/outdoor venue.
