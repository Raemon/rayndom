### Lightest Package

Description

This is an ideal package for a couple that wants a beautiful and meaningful ceremony that is on the shorter side. This is not the package for couple's that want to incorporate a lot of cultural elements or personalization. -Some personalization -Poetry or Readings Intro Call 1 Meeting

### Light Package

Description

This is my most popular package! I have the opportunity to bring in personalization, poetry, cultural practices and traditions, and get to know you and your partner really well throughout the process. The difference between this and the "Full Package" is rehearsal attendance. -Fully Personalized Ceremony -Questionnaire -Cultural Traditions -Poetry or Readings -Intro Call + 1-2 Meetings
