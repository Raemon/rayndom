Leticia captured this special day perfectly! Her execution, and attention to detail were met over and beyond my expectations. Very professional and very pleasant to work with.

  * ### Flawless from start to finish. 

•Verified review

•Melissa H.•Dec 25, 2024

Beyond My Wildest Dreams – A Seamless, Stress-Free Experience! From start to finish, my experience with Lethy and team was absolutely incredible. They made the entire process so easy and stress-free, which was a gift during such a busy time. The wedding planning was flawless, and every detail was executed perfectly. The cake was nothing short of a masterpiece—stunning to look at and even better to taste. It completely exceeded my expectations, and I received endless compliments from our guests. If you’re looking for a team that combines professionalism, creativity, and heart, look no further. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience! Highly recommend!
