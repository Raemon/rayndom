Can’t put into words how great our experience with The Chalet Event Center went throughout our entire wedding planning process! They went above and beyond to walk us through what our big day would look like on the property- from ceremony to reception, they executed our vision and made our dream wedding a night to remember. Bosue, you are an amazing host and thank you for helping us have our dream wedding. Not only did you fulfill all of our wishes, you really came through for us when there was going to be a 59% chance of rain. Most brides have so much on their mind, but you reassured me that there would be a back up plan incase of bad weather (something I failed to think of). It’s the little things like this, that I take away from working with a business. They remember the things we may forget! It’s all in the details! The food was amazing on our wedding night, the kitchen killed it! The bar staff were so friendly, welcoming and helped keep our guests happy! The on site staff, Bosue and Roberto ensured our day went smoothly (timing, everything was set up correctly, and guests were attended to when they needed something). I could go on and on, but my favorite thing was that Bosue had the best communication. Throughout all of my planning, he really accommodated all of my requests and was always available from May 2024 (planning stages) to our big day 10/25/2025. The Chalet is a beautiful place to host an event, whether an outdoor ceremony or inside reception- they truly went above and beyond to make our day special. And with that being said, I highly recommend this event space and the staff here. They are a one of a kind team thank you Chalet Team from the bottom of our hearts, you know we will be back for another event! With love, The Parkers

The Chalet Event Center was the perfect venue for our wedding day. From the very beginning, the team at The Chalet was incredibly responsive and helpful, making the planning process smooth and stress-free. Bryanna, the coordinator, did an amazing job facilitating everything and ensuring the day went off without a hitch. The entire staff was attentive and went above and beyond to make our day truly special. The venue itself is beautifully kept up, with a warm and inviting atmosphere that our guests raved about. Bosue, the owner, has such a wonderful personality and really makes you feel like family when working with him. His passion for The Chalet is evident in every detail. We are so grateful to have celebrated our special day at this incredible venue and would highly recommend it to any couple looking for a stress-free, memorable wedding experience.
