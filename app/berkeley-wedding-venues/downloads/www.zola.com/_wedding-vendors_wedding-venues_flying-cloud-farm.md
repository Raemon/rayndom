  * ### Everything you could ever want in a venue!

•Verified review

•Cassidy D.•Nov 6, 2025

We used Flying Cloud Farm for our October wedding, and it was absolutely perfect! The venue is stunning—offering both beautiful indoor and outdoor spaces surrounded by horses, chickens, and the occasional wildlife visitor, which added such a charming touch. Our coordinator, Julia, made everything feel effortless. She truly knows every detail of what it takes to plan the perfect event and executed everything flawlessly on the big day. The newly expanded bridal suite is gorgeous—spacious, elegant, and ideal for getting ready and capturing those special bridal photos. We also had iffy weather leading up to our wedding, and Julia had a seamless backup plan ready to go just in case. Knowing they were completely prepared for rain gave us such peace of mind, and their flexibility ensured everything would have been just as beautiful no matter what the forecast decided to do. We couldn’t recommend Flying Cloud Farm more highly for any special event. It’s a magical place run by truly wonderful people!

Flying Cloud Farm was the perfect venue for our wedding. From the moment we reached out, Julia was incredibly friendly, helpful and supportive throughout the entire planning process. Their elegant, diverse indoor and outdoor setup options allowed us to create the beautiful, personalized wedding of our dreams. Our amazing coordinator played so many vital roles, seamlessly coordinating vendors, overseeing the setup, managing the timeline and transitions, and ensuring a smooth takedown. The new bridal suite was a beautiful surprise, and their all-inclusive package was an incredible value with breathtaking views. The team at Flying Cloud Farm are true experts in event planning, and we are so grateful for the role they played in making our special day perfect.

•Kristen B.•Sep 29, 2025

From the moment we reached out to Flying Cloud Farm, the team was quick to respond and incredibly friendly. Julia, the venue coordinator, was so attentive and thorough in helping us plan every detail of our special day. The venue itself is absolutely beautiful, with lush greenery and a peaceful, quiet atmosphere that created the perfect setting for our wedding. They also have recently updated their bridal suite which turned out absolutely fabulous! Julia and the staff went above and beyond to ensure our day ran smoothly and that we felt right at home. Julia feels like family now, and we are so grateful to her and the entire Flying Cloud team for making our wedding day truly unforgettable.
