I aspire to deliver perfectly imperfect images that will be treasured forever. My style is documentary & candid. While I do enjoy posed moments, I believe your family's love shines through best when you are being yourselves. This means you don't have to worry about kids being on their best behavior - I am a professional toddler wrangler & believe the crazy moments create the best pictures. You don't have to be a professional model to have a fun session that comes with gorgeous imagery. You, your partner, & your family only need to be yourselves, and with some direction from me, I promise you will receive your new favorite pictures.

After you submit your inquiry, I will follow up within 24 hours to begin planning your session or event - we can also meet for coffee if you are local (my treat!). I tailor every session & wedding to my client's needs to ensure they are left with images that are uniquely them & show their story. I am proud of my ongoing connection & relationships with my clients. Many have invited me back time & time again to capture special moments over the years. I believe in kind-hearted communication, openness with expression, and approachability with your vision and values. This means getting to know my clients on a personal level.

  * ### The Sweetest Photographer! 15/10

•Verified review

•Anna B.•Apr 9, 2025

I am beyond grateful for the incredible experience working with Bailey! Even as someone who isn’t personally comfortable in front of the camera, she made me feel completely at ease with her warmth, kindness, and professionalism. Not only is she fabulous behind the camera in capturing moments with such artistry, but she also brings a sense of joy and positivity to every session. Her uplifting energy made the entire process fun and relaxed, and the results make me smile so much to see the love she’s captured between my husband and I. Every photo is a beautiful testament to her talent, and I will always treasure the memories she has helped create. I truly can't recommend her enough—if you're looking for someone who’s not just skilled, but genuinely kind and wonderful to work with, she's the one!

## Frequently asked questions

8 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 13 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, I prefer focusing on photography only, so you can get the best wedding pictures possible.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Yes, my 8 hour package offers the ability to include a second photographer. My 10 hour package includes a second photographer & an assistant, subject to availability.
