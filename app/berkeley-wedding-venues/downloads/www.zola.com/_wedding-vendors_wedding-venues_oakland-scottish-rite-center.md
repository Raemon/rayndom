## About this venue

The Oakland Scottish Rite Center was completed in 1927, with over a thousand craftsmen working on the project. The construction cost was approximately $1.5 million. This was a sizeable sum at the time equivalent to about $22 million today. From ground breaking to completion the edifice was erected in just two years. This is the second temple in Oakland built from the ground up by the Scottish Rite Masonic fraternity since 1883, when it was first chartered in Oakland.
