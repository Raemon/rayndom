He’s thorough, professional, knowledgeable, friendly, easy going and a pleasure to work with. He was patient as we navigated the process and worked closely with us to create amazing playlists. We also had him play guitar during the reception and it was magnificent! Finally, when we asked for some last-minute changes, he accommodated them with grace and understanding.

Golden Bell Music 5.0

  * Band or Ensemble
  * Starts at $4,500 
  * Serves San Jose, CA
  * Offer

Golden Bell offers a unique musical blend that packs a high-energy punch! The DJ/live fusion band, or DJ/live band hybrid, is always anchored on a DJ set but supported by live musicians. With all the energy and hype of a live band and the flexibility of a DJ, you won’t have to decide between hiring a band or a DJ for your next event or wedding.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Golden Bells was PHENOMENAL! Marlon and the entire band absolutely crushed it at our wedding. Not only is every musician insanely talented, but Marlon curated the night perfectly -- easing in with oldies to get our parents and older guests moving, then seamlessly shifting into the EDM, pop, and Bay Area rap we love. It felt like the soundtrack of us, and everyone could feel that. One of the highlights of the night was when the band came onto the dance floor with drums, trumpet, guitar, and trombone -- and even let us drum in a bit. The energy was unbelievable. And Hava Nagila with a full live band? Unreal. The band/DJ fusion setup made the entire reception feel elevated, unique, and unforgettable. They're truly a one-of-one. We got so many compliments throughout the night and later about the music, the vibe, and the experience the band created. Everything ran smoothly -- from emceeing to sound to transitions -- and you can tell the quality of their equipment and professionalism is top-notch. We can't thank Marlon and the Golden Bells team enough for making our wedding feel like a celebration we'll never forget. Highly, highly recommend them!”Sam, 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/4e91b90b-013d-4ad8-9331-a14c876020d8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/golden-bell-music)

  * Serves San Jose, CA

I’ve been playing weddings for over twelve years and I love my work! My services cover any or all aspects of wedding & receptions. I have found my life’s artistic calling in becoming flexible to every type of music my clients could desire. I learn to enjoy whatever my clients love and this resonance makes my job sustainable and ever-enjoyable. But, I do tend to request the ability to make choices for the dance-floor that rely on my years of dance-enhancing experience. I meet with my clients to determine what music they would love to hear and what music they do NOT want to hear.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Brandon was an outstanding DJ who supported our wedding this last February. I loved that he had outfit options, as our wedding was themed "Love Through the Ages" and we requested all of our guests to wear attire from their favorite decade. It was fabulous that we were able to pick his super awesome outfit to stand out (and in theme) for the wedding. He curated the most amazing playlist, based on our theme, so we got to drift through music from the 20's, 30's, 40's, and all the way through to current day. He is such a charismatic and engaging host and was able to convince folks (who I never thought would have danced) to get onto the dance floor. I can't say enough about how pleased we were with Brandon's talents and feel so grateful that The Knot had him on their vendor list for us to find.”Janae, 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/a56f136f-0583-4e61-9621-20c6d8c908bb?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/the-celebration-dj)

Nina calls every month at the Third Saturday Barn Dance at Pie Ranch, as well as private parties and events.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Nina and the band members she organized and brought in for our wedding were amazing. Nina picked great songs, and somehow a room full of novices were able to follow along much better than I thought we would! Everyone had such a blast, and Nina's ungendered calling meant that all my guests were fully included, whoever they were and whoever they were dancing with. Nina was great at communicating beforehand and she and the band members were really patient with us and friendly and flexible. Bringing in a square dance caller and string band was the one thing I really splurged on in our low-budget wedding, and I would definitely do it all over again.”fern W., 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/bee36d67-afff-4ed6-b722-75bb9d54e876?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/nina-berry-square-dance-calling)

I work closely with every couple to plan playlists, announcements, and timing that reflect their personality and vision. Whether it’s a romantic ceremony, a smooth dinner set, or an epic party finale, I bring professional sound and the right energy for every moment.“Our wedding wouldn’t have been half as fun without DJ Buddy Holly! From the ceremony music to the last dance, everything flowed perfectly. He read the crowd like a pro—grandparents were dancing next to our college friends, and the transitions were seamless. The lighting setup made the whole venue glow, and his announcements kept things organized but never cheesy. You can tell he genuinely cares about making it the best night ever. Highly recommend for anyone who wants their dance floor packed all night!”Sarah M., 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/dj-buddy-holly)

From my first interaction with Rob to working with Nick on our wedding day, everything was so smooth and professional. I was looking for a non-traditional wedding DJ, someone who wasn't too cheesy or "in your face," and that is exactly what I found with this company. We loved working with Nick M. and had chosen him specifically because he was recommended for the type of music we prefer. He read the room and understood the vibe we were going for and was able to fill in the blanks in our provided playlists perfectly. We got so many compliments from guests regarding how good the music was, which made us really happy. Nick was also very flexible and accommodating as we had a lot of last-minute song choices (night before and day-of). He did everything to make sure we were on the same page with the song choices and song order, especially regarding the grand entrance and first dance songs. My only regret is that I didn't get to talk to Nick more amongst the craziness of the wedding day!

My husband and I were completely in awe, and our guests couldn’t stop talking about how beautiful and cinematic the music was. It felt like something straight out of a movie, especially with the stunning ambiance of our ceremony location. From the very beginning, the process of choosing music through the company’s website was seamless. There were so many amazing song options to pick from, and we were so happy with our final selections. Hearing them come to life — especially on violin and harp — was beyond words. The musicians played so eloquently and gracefully, and their talent was unmatched. The music added a romantic, emotional, and elegant touch that elevated everything to a whole new level. Communication with the company was excellent. They were quick to respond, always friendly and accommodating, and remained professional and patient — even when unexpected weather challenges came up on the day of the wedding. They were flexible, understanding, and worked with us to make sure everything went smoothly. The quality of the performance was truly a 10 out of 10. Guests were completely blown away, and many told us how unforgettable and moving the ceremony music was. The transitions between songs were smooth and perfectly timed. I would 100% recommend this company to any couple looking to add something special to their ceremony. They are incredibly talented, professional, punctual, and just a dream to work with.

He listened to our music needs, which were not the clearest at times, but nonetheless he came up with a great playlist that fit the diverse age range and what we were envisioning. It seemed that all the guests were dancing on the dance floor at some point in the evening. Just recently a guest from the wedding reached out commenting how Conner was the best wedding DJ they have ever heard. Conner brings a cool, sophisticated vibe that is truly great for all age demographics. Additionally, Conner was super professional, on time, and had state of the art sound equipment. He also did an incredible job micing the night and keeping the pace. The fact that I didn't want the night to end speaks volumes to how much I enjoyed our wedding and a big part of that was the music. Hiring the right DJ is one of the best wedding decisions we made and was also way more cost effective than a live band. To wrap this up, we are so thankful Conner decided to take his DJ talents to the wedding industry. I am sure his business will take off.

My guests still talk about how fun our wedding was because of the amazing live music. All three guys that performed were so KIND, FUN, and PROFESSIONAL! They played a variety of genres and even did a song or two in Spanish. We were so impressed.

He was very thoughtful in curating the music for our day and I hope you find what you are looking for with him. I am a wedding vendor of 15 years as well doing hair, makeup and morning concierge. One of my past brides at one of my most favorite venues to work at is how I was introduced to Joey. After coming out of the hair room I love taking a moment to walk around the venue and there he was playing the cello along with some background music. I was hooked. I love that he was incorporating songs of today with the art of an instrument. I found it unique and something I wanted to showcase at my wedding. I didn’t want people to walk up to just music playing in the space, but an experience. Joey took the time to do 2 calls with us, one being over the phone and the second being over zoom. He came with a detailed questionnaire of how we wanted our wedding to go. It was so detailed that even a music mood girl I didn’t even think of. The calls were scheduled for 30 minutes but he didn’t hesitate to chat with me for over an hour on how I wanted it to be curated. I had already started 2 wedding playlists, but he added and sent me 5 to 6 albums to fill out of songs I loved and wanted. I had over 10 hours of music to play and not only did he take those into consideration he added music that my guests also requested. He even accepted me saying change this song and only play the 10 year olds music every 10 songs He needed to set up in two spaces, one for the ceremony which was outside on our property. He was set up and playing by the time guests arrived. Everyone I spoke with loved the music selection, which I told him “Bridgerton vibes” and he ran with it. After the ceremony his assistant had music playing for the cocktail hour while they broke down the equipment in the ceremony area. I was blown away by the lights that were brought and the look of everything. Microphones worked for speeches and he even had a stand for those who wanted to use them. We didn’t do a traditional walk in but he announced us perfectly and we ran around the tables saying hello to our friends and family. I would recommend Joey to anyone looking to have an experience for their guests, have a DJ but also want strings all in one. He was professional, timely and for someone who did not have a day of coordination or planner very informative. I wanted vendors to do what they do best and I’m glad I trusted him to provide us with music throughout the day and night!”Melissa S., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/c28b6bb4-5f8d-44e6-9da5-06d5debc29e8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/cello-joe-productions)
