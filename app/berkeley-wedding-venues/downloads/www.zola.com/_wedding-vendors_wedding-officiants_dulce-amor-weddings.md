Hi, I’m Norma, your Sacramento wedding officiant and love celebrant. I’m a non-denominational minister ordained by the Universal Life Church. And I’m delighted you are here! My communication style is clear, concise, and consistent so you can arrive with confidence and excitement on your wedding day. As someone who married her soulmate, I understand the importance of having a ceremony that honors that journey. Finding true love is not easy. So let’s celebrate that magical gift!

Your wedding, big or small, has many moving parts, but it all begins with your ceremony. At the altar, in front of friends and family, you declare your love, promises, and say “I do” to your one true love. That day, you want to feel confident and excited about your ceremony. You want to celebrate your love and new beginning in a way that feels true to you. As your Sacramento bilingual wedding officiant, I am committed to helping you accomplish that.
