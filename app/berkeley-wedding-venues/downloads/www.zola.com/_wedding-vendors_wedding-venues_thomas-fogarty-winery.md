## About this venue

Thomas Fogarty Winery is an intimate, elegant, and relaxing setting for memorable events! Surrounded by our working vineyards & handsome redwoods, our event spaces flow down the mountainside on three separate levels, each offering stunning views. Our spacious Hill House & Pavilion accommodates indoor and outdoor weddings, corporate, and other private events. The 4,000 sq. ft. covered Pavilion overlooks our Damiana Chardonnay vineyard and can host the ultimate outdoor reception. It also serves as an elegant alternate ceremony space for our special wedding couples. Our Pavilion's unique copper roof and open air feel make the structure truly a Bay Area "one of a kind.” The Hill House and its adjoining Terrace is perfect for an indoor dining reception, lined with glass windows on runners allowing it to be closed off on cooler days without sacrificing our famous view. Contact us for a site visit! We would love to meet you!
