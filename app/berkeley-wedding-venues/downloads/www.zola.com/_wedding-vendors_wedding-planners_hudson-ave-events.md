  * ### She knows what she’s doing!

•Verified review

•Rebecca•Oct 21, 2025

Hudson Ave Events (specifically Jacquelins, who was our coordinator) was the perfect choice for us. Despite only signing up for month-of services, she communicated with us well before then and her communication was clear, concise and helpful as she guided us through the process. Jacqueline and her team proved to be incredibly knowledgeable, detail-oriented and honest in their approach. On the day of the wedding, she seamlessly troubleshot any minor mishaps behind the scenes, ensuring everything ran smoothly without adding any unnecessary stress. Her proactive communication with our vendors was also greatly appreciated. It's clear Jacqueline and her team have a wealth of experience planning weddings, and we're so grateful they were there to make our special day everything we dreamed of and more.

  * ### Amazing Planner

•Verified review

•Ruby•Jun 23, 2025

We are so happy we chose Jacqueline as our partial wedding planner for our June wedding at Ruth Bancroft Gardens in Walnut Creek. Since she's based in Walnut Creek and has done many weddings there, she knows all the ins and outs of the garden and has great connections with local vendors. Her knowledge, responsiveness, and fantastic suggestions made a huge difference whenever we needed help. We started with a phone call to discuss our wedding vision and get to know each other. About six months before the wedding, we did a walkthrough of the venue together. Jacqueline was always there to promptly answer our questions through email, and she even joined us on our trip to Chairs for Affairs (rentals) to help pick out linens, tables, decorations, bar stands, and more. We saw her again at our rehearsal dinner, where her direction made everything run smoothly. The day before the wedding, she graciously helped print and frame all our signs. On the day of our wedding, everything went off without a hitch, thanks to Jacqueline's help with the schedule. She even made sure we ate! The day was a fun blur, and we were so grateful to have her there. Wedding planning can be stressful, even for those who enjoy it. Jacqueline made the process so much easier and put us at ease. If you're looking for a wedding planner in the Bay Area, we highly recommend Jacqueline. She offers month of coordination, along with partial and full-service wedding planning. She will make sure your day goes smoothly and worry-free.

  * ### She was a LIFESAVER

•Verified review

•Brittany B.•Jun 23, 2025

Our wedding planner was an absolute lifesaver! The venue attempted to change the location of our reception just five weeks before the wedding. She immediately led the charge to make sure the venue honored our contract, advocating for us every step of the way. Throughout the entire planning process, she went above and beyond, always having our backs and fighting for us when needed. Her dedication and attention to detail kept everything running smoothly, handling every challenge flawlessly. We truly couldn’t be happier with her support and would recommend her wholeheartedly to anyone planning their special day!
