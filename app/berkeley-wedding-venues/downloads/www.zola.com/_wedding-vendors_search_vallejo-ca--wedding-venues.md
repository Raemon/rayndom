![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Absolutely loved working with the Jefferson Street Mansion staff. We felt very heard and catered to. We received so many compliments from friends and family about the venue, staff, vendors, food, and music. It really is a "have it your way" set up, you can choose to have a big grandiose wedding or small minimalist wedding. I arrived to the venue on wedding day with zero nerves because I knew the staff and coordinator knew my expectations.”Aysaiah and I., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4114f028-4335-4de9-b642-46714084461c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/jefferson-street-mansion-by-wedgewood-weddings)

I had an art gallery show and celebration of living. The staff was quick to reply to my emails and generous with their support. The day of the art exhibit the staff was helpful and kind. They kept an eye on me better than my own family, bringing me food and drinks. The food was good and I had 7 passed appetizers and a prime rib carving station.

“We had a wonderful wedding - the Wedgewood team helped us create a meaningful ceremony and reception. The pictures online do not do this place justice - you have to see it for yourself! The grounds are beautiful; we had our ceremony at the pavilion and our reception in the garden area / in their indoor hall area. The venue definitely felt like a fairy / cottage core dream to me! Wedgewood also vendors that work with them and provide really excellent services - florals, music, cakes.

“Both my wife and I are from bay areas so it was important to get married by the water. I can’t stress enough how beautiful this venue is. It’s pretty much all inclusive, you can bring your own booze, vendors and decorations. It includes a stay in their fabulous inn which is 4 bedrooms. Our whole bridal party stayed and it was the best experience. We decided to book the night before too. You can even take pictures on the Marina docks right next to the property (for a small fee). The place itself is so dreamy, we used one lawn for our ceremony and one for lawn games and our cocktail tables. Watching the sunset from the reception space and the sparkly lights on both lawns was just sooo gorgeous. Now for the team, they went ABOVE and BEYOND to accommodate our requests and answer all my hundred questions and they were so flexible with us when we had to postpone for Covid twice. We are incredibly grateful for the team. They shared all their tips and tricks and made our wedding perfect. The coordination between the wedding venue and our planner was flawless. And best part was the seamless delivery of our late night snack, hot pretzels! And the space perfect accommodated a photo booth which everyone loved. We finally got married in September 2023! I highly recommend as a wedding venue 10/10.”Ashley (McCullough) T., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-lighthouse-glen-cove-marina)

“The team at Yaara Napa Events was helpful and flexible in their communication, making the planning process a breeze. The venue itself is not fancy, but rather holds a rustic, nature filled appeal as it's a working farm ( our guests loved meeting their pygmy goats). We chose this place because it was a beautiful location close enough to our guests hotels in downtown Napa, and it fit perfectly within our limited venue budget. After the ceremony, photos and a toast, we took our guests for dinner at a restaurant to continue celebrating.”Itay, 9 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/yaara-napa-events)
