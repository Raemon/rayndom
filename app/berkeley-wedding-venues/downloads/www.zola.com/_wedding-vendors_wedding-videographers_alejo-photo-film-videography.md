Alejo Photo + Film is a husband and wife photo and video duo. We love love and adventure, and we especially love combining the two! We are trilingual (English, Spanish, Japanese) and experienced travelers. We offer digital photo and video, drone footage, 35mm film photos, and super 8mm film videos.

We aren't your traditional wedding photography style. We love to capture editorial photos as well as the day's raw emotions. Incorporating film helps us do that and adds a level of fun anticipation to your final gallery! Until that delivery day, though, we always send a sneak peek!

  * ### Wedding Video 

•Verified review

•José and A.•Oct 29, 2024

Alejo Photo Film Videography was a pleasure to work with for our wedding. They communicated very clearly and understandably throughout the entire process, making it easy for us to understand what to expect. On the day of the wedding, they took great care to capture all the special moments that made our day so unique and meaningful. You can tell they take true passion in bringing their clients' visions to life, as the final video was beautifully edited and really reflected the spirit of our wedding. We're thrilled with the quality of their work and the value they provided. Highly recommend Alejo Photo Film to any couple looking for a talented videography team to document their wedding day.

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you film destination weddings?

Absolutely! We are tri-lingual (English, Spanish, and Japanese) and have travel experience in more than 8 countries. Destination weddings have their own custom pricing, and can include a wedding eve session. Our favorite destinations in the US are national parks. Our favorite countries to shoot in are Japan, Mexico, and Ireland.

### Do you film elopements?

We love elopements! Reach out anytime to ask about our special pricing for elopements! Please note your elopement must have fewer than 10 total guests.

### Do you have insurance?

Yes! We’re happy to send a copy of our certificate of liability insurance to your venue or any other vendors upon request.

### Who will edit our wedding video?

I personally edit all videos. We do not believe in outsourcing editing. We believe final videos and photos lack emotion and storytelling when their edits are outsourced to people who weren't present for the moments captured.

### Can you still film our outdoor wedding if it rains on our wedding day?

Barring extreme weather, we are prepared to film in light rain and light snow.
