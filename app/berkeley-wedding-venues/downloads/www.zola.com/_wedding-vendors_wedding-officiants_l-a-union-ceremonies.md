Hi, I'm Lilian Argueta, a proud Guatemalan American, native Angelina, and the heart behind L+A Union Ceremonies. I’ve always believed in the power of human connection and the importance of honoring it with authenticity, care, and soul. I’ve been a certified officiant since 2017, and my path to this work has been anything but traditional—in the best way. L+A stands for Luz y Amor, light and love in Spanish. It’s more than a name; it’s a belief system. I believe we are all energy, all light…and when two people come together in love, something truly magical happens. That magic deserves to be witnessed and celebrated with intention & creativity.

I don’t just create vows, I craft meaningful ceremonies that reflect the unique love and vision of each couple. Whether you’re drawn to tradition or something new, I design ceremonies that are sacred, cinematic, and unmistakably you. As queer individuals and allies of the community, my life and business partner and I bring our diverse faith backgrounds to every ceremony. We’re passionate about celebrating all forms of love and are committed to honoring your values and traditions in a way that feels authentic. Let me help you tell your story and bring your vision to life with a ceremony that leaves a lasting impact.

**In three words:** Collaborative, Empathetic, Supportive

  * ### Cultured and Friendly!

•Verified review

•Joyce•Oct 10, 2025

We hit a stroke of luck when we found Lilian on Zola! From our very first call, my husband and I felt an instant connection with her. She guided us through every detail—from the paperwork we needed to thoughtful feedback on our vows—and even helped us incorporate a cacao ritual from Guatemala into our ceremony. Lilian truly brought our wedding to life. It was a perfect 10/10 experience!

  * ### Amazing ! 

•Verified review

•Joselin O.•Oct 8, 2025

L A Union Ceremonies were absolutely incredible to work with for our wedding ceremony. From the very first interaction, their communication style was amazing - lovely, heartfelt, and personalized. They truly took the time to get to know us as a couple and crafted an unforgettable ceremony that felt tailor-made for our special day. Their quality of work and attention to detail was top-tier, and I couldn't have picked a better person to officiate our wedding. She was extremely easy to work with, extremely lovely, and made the entire process seamless. I'm so grateful we found L A Union Ceremonies to be a part of our big day. The most unforgettable part is that I wanted a Spanglish wedding and she made it happen !

  * ### Don't think twice, Highly Recommended!

•Verified review

•Craig and D.•Sep 30, 2025

Lillian really went the extra mile with our wedding. She was considerate, nurturing, kind, and impactful throughout the whole process. From planning to the day of the ceremony, she made us feel comfortable, heard, and provided great feedback to bring it all to life. Our ceremony was unique in that it needed to cater to a multilingual audience. Rest assured every detail was rehearsed and well thought out, and she presented the ceremony with great personality. If you are considering LA Union Ceremonies (Lillian) to officiate your wedding, you have our full confidence that it will be the right choice. Avec Amour!!!

  * ### Personalized, Meaningful Ceremony with Lilian

•Verified review

•Emily K.•Sep 8, 2025

We are so grateful we found Lilian of L A Union Ceremonies to officiate our wedding. Though she’s based in SoCal, she flew up to San Francisco for our ceremony, and from start to finish she was an absolute joy to work with. When looking for an officiant, we wanted someone non-traditional to match the kind of ceremony we envisioned - bride and groom walking down the aisle together, no wedding processional or religious elements, and none of the “standard” wedding language that didn’t fit us. Lilian put us completely at ease. She clearly cares deeply about her work and pours so much love into the process, from having us each complete a thoughtful questionnaire to custom-writing a ceremony script that felt like “us,” to helping along the way with things like last-minute support for vows. On the day of, she was the calming presence we needed - talking us through our nerves right beforehand so we could truly enjoy the moment. Her attention to detail continued all the way through, even down to sending us a photo of her mailing off our signed marriage license application. And afterward, she surprised us with a thoughtful keepsake that showed just how much she goes the extra mile for her couples. If you want a true partner in creating a meaningful, personalized ceremony, Lilian should absolutely be your go-to. We can’t recommend her highly enough.

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### How long have you been in business?

I’ve been officially in business since 2017. Fun fact, I actually was first ordained in 2012, wanting to specialize in LGBTQ+ weddings for my close friends!

### Do you do rehearsals? Is that included in your cost?

Absolutely— depending on whether or not you need/want a rehearsal, happy to include this fee in your total cost. Anything to make your day, that much easier!

### Can we personalize our ceremony?

Oh 100%. This is my bread and butter and the soul of what my business is about. Whatever you and your partner would like, I am here to cater to you!

### We’re legally married already. Can you still do our ceremony?

Absolutely! Whether you’re already legally married or just planning a celebration, I’d be honored to officiate your ceremony. I’m here for the love part, legal or not.

### Do you provide or require premarital counseling?

I offer optional pre-ceremony sessions that help couples reflect, connect, and prepare for their marriage in a meaningful way. These are not therapy sessions, but guided conversations around communication, values, and your shared vision. It’s a chance to set intentional ground before your big day. Note: I’m not a licensed therapist, but I do hold a degree in Human Development and bring a grounded, relational approach to this work.
