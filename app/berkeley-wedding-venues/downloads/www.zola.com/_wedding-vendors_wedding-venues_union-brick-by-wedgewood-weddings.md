  * ### A day to remember 

•Verified review

•Marilu M.•Jul 1, 2025

Union Brick By Wedgewood Weddings was an excellent choice for our wedding venue. The communication with the staff, especially Keilah, Savanna, and Nathalie, was superb - they were always willing to help and very approachable. The venue itself had an elegant, spacious, and calm aura that was great value for the cost. The food prepared by Jeremy and his crew was excellent, and the open bar was overflowing, providing great service throughout the night. The DJs kept the dance floor lively, and the photobooth was a fun addition. The security was also courteous, ensuring our special day went off without a hitch. We had an overall excellent experience at Union Brick By Wedgewood Weddings and would highly recommend it to any couple planning their wedding.

  * ### Union Brick made our day perfect! 

•Verified review•Incentivized review

•Amanda D.•Sep 22, 2024

Union Brick By Wedgewood Weddings was the perfect venue for our wedding day. From the beginning, their communication was quick, detailed, open and honest, which put us at ease throughout the planning process. The venue itself was absolutely beautiful, with a great value for the large and versatile space. Amanda, our event pre-wedding coordinator, went above and beyond to ensure every detail was taken care of - she answered every question, email and call, and was always there for my husband, myself and my mom. On the day of the wedding, Kayla, our day-of coordinator, was detailed, thorough and wonderful, making sure everything ran smoothly. Our banquet staff and bartenders were also attentive and made sure we and our guests were taken care of all night long. We are so grateful to the Union Brick team for making our special day truly perfect.

  * ### Excellent! I didn't have to worry about a thing

•Verified review

•Chloe M.•Mar 8, 2024

I was a bride who really didn't want to do much of anything in terms of planning. Wedgewood made it SO easy with their all in one service and their recommended vendors for the few things that didn't come included. We made decisions on the spot and there was never any pushiness. Our day ended up being the best day ever and I had 0 stress, thanks to them!

  * ### A perfect day

•Verified review

•Beth and M.•Sep 5, 2023

Wedgewood made everything so easy. I loved our event coordinator who really went above and beyond. The decor was beautiful and the day was perfect. I have major anxiety in general and I was able to relax and marry my best friend without having to stress about the details. I highly recommend them.
